But now, as an adult, I realize that nothing is scarier than Crawford's performance in this movie.  I defy you -- absolutely defy you -- not to giggle (much less guffaw) during the scene where Diane Baker brings her boyfriend home to meet Mother.

335991,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6302799171,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[1, 2]","This was Joan Crawford's big comeback film and she puts her all into this Camp Classic!  If she doesn't get her way heads will roll.  Written by Psycho creator Robert Bloch and directed by William Castle, Crawford gives an Academy Award performance in this B horror film.  Her daughter played by Diane Baker takes her in after Lucy Harbin (Crawford) gets out of a mental ward after having chopped off the 6,000,000 dollar man's head (Lee Majors).When her doctor (played by a non-actor Pepsi executive) comes to take her back to the asylum axes and heads again meet each other.  We even get some good scenes with a young and non-fat George Kennedy as a lowlife who does his own take on Marie Antoinette.The DVD version has some classic head-chopping outtakes as well as a &quot;making of Straitjacket&quot; short.This was 1963 and though the plot and especially the &quot;twist&quot; ending is ridiculous its got some good surrealism that proved a harbinger of better films later in the decade.

335992,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,6302799171,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[5, 5]","This William Castle shocker has the best opening EVER! A scream, shattering glass, and Joan Crawford's contorted face filling the screen followed by the announcement &quot;Lucy Harbin was declared insane today!&quot;, before abruptly segueuing into brash Jazz music! I guarantee, you will be blinking, and pressing rewind to relish this moment. The film is a schlocky thriller in which an aging Crawford appears to be responsible for a spate of axe murders following her release from an asylum. She has a great role in this, especially in scenes where she tries to turn back the clock by dressing up as a 1940's tart with jangly bangles and jet-black wig. Most memorable is the scene where she gets drunk and tries to seduce her daughter's fiance, but watch out also for the moment when she laconically strikes a match on an LP record as it is playing...another classic moment. The film belongs entirely to Joan, who chews up the scenery in a way echoed by Faye Dunaway's camp performance (as Joan!) in &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; There are some great scenes involving axe beheadings, and Joan's nightmares in which severed heads appear to haunt her. It's a shame that too many reviews have revealed the ending...try not to let this put you off, the plot is handled with unbelievable bravado, and the climax is great fun.

335993,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,6302799171,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[3, 4]","Buying the DVD of Joan Crawford's STRAIT JACKET was a gamble on my part since I've never seen it and I've only seen three of her previous filmsThe Women (Keepcase),Mildred Pierce (Keepcase), and my favoriteWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (Two-Disc Special Edition), so I didn't really know what to expect from this film.As you can tell by my rating I really enjoyed this movie! STRAIT JACKET was written by Robert Bloch who wrote the novel ""Psycho,"" which was then turned into the classic horror film by the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, and according to IMDB, Bloch was also a writer for many of the episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"" so the movie has a strong whodunnit type storyline that will keep you guessing.In the film, Crawford plays ""Lucy Harbin,"" a woman who is just getting out of a mental asylum after spending 20-years there for hacking up her cheating husband (played by a young Lee ""Six Million Dollar Man"" Majors) and his girlfriend with an ax. Lucy comes to stay with her brother and his wife, and the young daughter she left behind so many years before. Suddenly, the bodies start piling up again and it seems that Lucy is coming apart at the seams.Although the movie is campy at times, particularly when Crawford is playing her character as an older woman trying to reclaim her youth, she and the rest of the cast take the storyline and their respective roles seriously, so it never comes off as a farce. In fact, you'll get to see Crawford's range as an actress as she goes from a bawdy broad to a vulnerable, recluse wall-flower to a murderess psychopath, and it's really amazing. One can only wonder howHush... Hush Sweet Charlottewould have turned out had Crawford stayed on and if the roles were reversed...Surprisingly, to me anyway, Crawford is just as good playing the crazed bully as she is playing the helpless victim.Anyway, the film is great if you like suspenseful type movies and Crawford and the rest of the cast keep this movie on the razor's edge, between camp and cult. Quality of the picture is good on the DVD, nice and sharp with no noise or dust/scratches, and the audio is fine too.*****  EXTRAS  ****** ""Battle Ax: The Making of Strait-Jacket"" - 14:41-minute FeaturetteBehind the scenes footage including costume tests, and interviews conducted in 2002 with actress Diane Baker, who plays ""Carol"" Crawford's daughter in the movie, and film historians Don Glut, Michael Schleisinger(?), David Del Valle (?) -- I might have spelled their names wrong -- on how the movie came about.* ""Costume & Make-up Tests"" - 3:29-minutesJoan Crawford's costume and makeup tests. No sound; just the film's score playing over Joan as she poses in different outfits and expressions.* ""Ax-Swinging Screen Test"" - :39-secondsCrawford swinging the ax for a closeup.* Trailers - 3 trailers including STRAIT JACKET. Normally I don't watch the trailers or describe them in my review but these were really good!1. Strait Jacket - :23-secondsCrawford's voice over explaining why you should see the movie.2. Mr. Sardonicus - 03:36Producer and Director William Castle provides an introduction to this movie and touts it as the first film where the audience has a say in the ending of the movie. There was a way for movie goers to vote on which outcome they wanted when this film was in theaters way back then, which sounds like great fun.3. 13 Ghosts - 02:28Another Castle film and Castle introduces it. This turns out to be another interactive movie and Castle explains that patrons will get special ""ghost viewer"" glasses in the theater to see the ghosts in the movie. It probably sounds better than it actually was but for that time I'm sure it was a big draw.Anyway, if you enjoy black & white suspense movies that have cult/camp status or a fan of Joan Crawford, I would say buy the DVD.",5,"Although A ""B"" Movie, Shows Crawford's Acting Range!

335994,A4PTUEVFE13K6,6302799171,Allen Chapman,"[8, 12]","In 1961 Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were paired up in the classic ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" The film was a success and revived the otherwise dead careers of it's stars. The two (who couldn't stand each other in real life) were then supposed to star in it's follow-up ""Whatever Happened To Cousin Charlotte?"" However Ms. Crawford seemed to get ""sick"" during the early filming and was dropped from the picture. ""Cousin Charlotte"" was finished with Olivia DeHaviland in the role originally intended for Crawford and the was retitled ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"". That film tells the tale of an old woman who years earlier had killed her cheating boyfriend by hacking off his hand and head. Bette Davis got great reviews for her performance as the tormented Charlotte. Not to be outdone by her long time rival Joan Crawford then made ""Strait Jacket"". This movie tells a VERY similar tale as ""Charlotte"". The difference is that ""Strait Jacket"" is a weaker film. It is a fun film, but not as strong as the Davis movie. In ""Strait Jacket"" Crawford is a woman, who twenty years ago killed her cheating husband and his mistress by hacking off their heads with an ax (sound fimiliar?) and was sent to an asylum. We now jump ahead twenty years and all seems well until those around Crawford start losing their heads!!!I've never thought of Joan Crawford as a exceptional actress, she always seems to over act in everything. ""Strait Jacket"" is no exception. A fun ""thriller"" from it time period and if you liked ""Baby Jane"",""Charlotte"" or others from that era, you're sure to like this one as well. The ""Scooby Doo"" like wrap up is a bit much, but watch for the ""Columbia"" logo at the very end.

Especially when Columbia releases this as a[n expensive] DVD. Ideally, it should be on sale at the local hardware store for [less]. All of the Castle films seem to be getting this treatment and it is absurd. They just are not very good. I have to admit though that the screen tests with Crawford are brilliant and almost worth the price of admission ('almost' is the operative word here). But the 'making of' feature is ridiculous. One of the 'historians' interviewed (whom I have never heard of) claims that it was only because of the disreputable genre to which the film belonged that Crawford was passed over for an Oscar nomination! Really this is pure fantasy. (Especially since the other horror film he mentions -- Whatever Happened to Baby Jane -- did earn Bette Davis a Best Actress nomination.) Castle's attempt to top Hitchcock's Psycho -- he hired Robert Bloch to write the screenplay -- just demonstrates that Hitchcock's film belongs in a different class from these shlock horror works of the period.

At the end of Crawford's career she was clearly taking roles that she normally would not have bothered with, so even though many people rated this film highly, I think it's sad to see her in a movie like this, even though her performance is gutsy and interesting to watch. It's also pretty neat to see actors so early in their careers, like Lee Majors and George Kennedy. Best scene in the film: when the shrink from the asylum drops by for a visit and Crawford spontaneously lights a match on the turntable WHILE the record is playing (it reminds me of when Jack Lemmon strikes the match on his teeth in The Great Race). Not many actors could pull that off on camera, and it was perfectly in keeping with the character she was portraying. Sad to see her so deep in B-movie material such as this, especially when you compare it to her other great films like The Women, the 1927 silent movie with Lon Chaney called The Unknown, and Sudden Fear, but her performance here is certainly worth taking a look at, especially fans of Castle and Crawford or just of this movie genre.",2,Strait-Jacket Schlock,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,1217,"['Low', 'budget', 'B-grade', 'slasher', 'flick', 'complete', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'heads-a-rolling', 'transparent', 'inplausible', 'plot', 'lots', 'screaming', 'end', 'Crawford', 'career', 'was', 'clearly', 'taking', 'roles', 'normally', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'so', 'even', 'many', 'people', 'rated', 'film', 'highly', 'think', 'sad', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'performance', 'gutsy', 'interesting', 'watch', 'also', 'pretty', 'neat', 'see', 'actors', 'so', 'early', 'careers', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Best', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'shrink', 'asylum', 'drops', 'visit', 'Crawford', 'spontaneously', 'match', 'turntable', 'record', 'playing', 'when', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'match', 'teeth', 'Great', 'Race', 'Not', 'many', 'actors', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'camera', 'was', 'perfectly', 'keeping', 'character', 'was', 'portraying', 'Sad', 'see', 'so', 'deep', 'B-movie', 'material', 'such', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'Women', '1927', 'silent', 'movie', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'called', 'Unknown', 'Sudden', 'Fear', 'performance', 'here', 'certainly', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', 'especially', 'fans', 'Castle', 'Crawford', 'just', 'movie', 'genre']",N/A

336001,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302799171,Byron Kolln,"[2, 3]","Hot on the heels of her performance in ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"", Joan Crawford starred as a former axe-wielding psycho in William Castle's STRAIT-JACKET.  Crawford always managed to deliver a certified 100% gold performance in every film she ever starred, and this is no exception.  STRAIT-JACKET is a lurid--and downright loony--schlock thriller, but Crawford approaches and plays it like she's doing Medea.Lucy Harbin (Joan Crawford) was sent to the funny farm after butchering her husband and his mistress with an axe twenty years ago.  Now she's been released into the care of her adult daughter Carol (Diane Baker).  The only trouble is, the axe murders have started again...but this time Lucy isn't the culprit.  Robert Bloch (""Psycho"") provides the sharply-assembled screenplay, with fine support from Rochelle Hudson and Leif Erickson as Lucy's relations.  The film also features early appearances from George Kennedy and Lee Majors.In lots of ways, STRAIT-JACKET mirrors another movie of the period (""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"") in which Bette Davis plays a lonely Southern spinster still mourning the axe-slaying of her married lover.  Crawford was to have co-starred with Davis in the movie but dropped out, citing pneumonia (though it's believed she didn't want to work with Davis again following the difficult ""Baby Jane"" shoot), and Olivia de Havilland later replaced her.Crawford plays STRAIT-JACKET like it's ""Mildred Pierce: The Sequel"", looking eerily like a drag queen in her broad-shouldered cocktail dress.  Diane Baker (who had previously co-starred with Crawford in ""The Best of Everything"") gives a well-grounded performance as her sculptress daughter.  William Castle considered this as his prestige picture; it didn't rely on cheap gimmicks like some of his earlier hits and it's Oscar-winning star would guarantee an audience.  STRAIT-JACKET still stands up today largely because of Crawford's fearless performance, and it's still one hell of a good time!The DVD includes a Making-Of featurette (""Battle-Axe"") which has a new interview with Diane Baker, plus trailers and image galleries.

Long ago Joan Crawford came home to find her husband in bed with a floozie and snatched up an ax. Adjudged insane, she is locked up in an asylum for twenty years, but now she's home--and pretty soon some really weird things begin to happen around the old family farm. Could it be, oh, I don't know... JOAN? Throughout his career, producer-director William Castle liked to build his movies around gimmicks: TINGLER had ""Percepto,"" 13 GHOSTS had ""Illusion-O,"" and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL had ""Emergo."" But STRAIT-JACKET had something better: Joan Crawford herself, who plays in a style that can only be described as ""Emote-O-Rama.""Say what you like about Crawford, she never gave any performance less than one hundred percent, and in STRAIT-JACKET she gives one hundred and fifty. In the opening scenes, 60-something Joan has the unmitigated gall to play Lucy in her 20s! Later, as Lucy in her 40s, Joan plays the role like a nice little old lady who occasionally drops acid: when she's not busy with her nervous breakdown, she [drinks] bourbon, attempts to seduce her daughter's boyfriend (even to the point of putting her fingers in his mouth), knits like a fiend, lights a cigarette by striking a match on a record album, raises hell at a dinner party... and all of it about as subtle as a bulldozer. But they didn't call her a star for nothing: not only does Crawford manage to carry it off with complete conviction, she actually manages to endow the character with considerable pathos along the way. And I have absolutely no doubt that THIS was the film Faye Dunaway studied the most when preparing to play Crawford in the infamous MOMMIE DEAREST; watch both back-to-back and you'll know exactly what I mean.The rest of the cast is pretty interesting as well, featuring Diane Baker as daughter Carol, Leif Erickson as Crawford's brother, George Kennedy as an unsavory farmhand, and a very young Lee Majors as the ill-fated husband--not to mention Mitchell Cox, a Pepsi V.P. Joan was favoring at the time. There are cheap special effects (amazing, how she can neatly lop off a head or two with a single blow), Pepsi-Cola product placements, and even some dialogue that would do Ed Woods proud. It's all campy and bizarre and hilariously weird and ramped up to the nth degree by Crawford's full-force performance. With a somewhat better script and production values, STRAIT-JACKET could easily have matched Bette Davis' more sophistocated HUSH, HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE; as it stands, however, it is a cult movie in all caps. The DVD is very nicely done, with the film itself in excellent condition, a collection of Crawford's costume tests that give a surprising insight to actress' personality, and a particularly nice little making-of documentary that includes comments from Diane Baker.

""Strait Jacket"" is a prime example of this. Crawford plays Lucy Harbin, looking ridiculous in a black wig, annoying jangly jewelry, and skimpy dress, who comes home to find her husband in bed with another woman. Grabbing a conveniently available axe, she hacks them to death and goes to the Nut House for 20 years, only to be released to the care of her daughter (Diane Baker), who just as conveniently witnessed the killings as a little girl.

She is reunited with her estranged daughter, Carol (played by Diane Baker, who specialized in playing devious females at the time). Carol encourages her mother to dress like she did 20 years earlier,i.e. flower-printed dresses, jingly charm bracelets, and a black, 40s-style wig. Lucy does, and watch out! In what is my favorite scene in the film, Joan, looking like the world's oldest hooker, comes on to her daughter's handsome YOUNG fiance. It is almost obscene to watch this, but try and take your eyes off the screen! Mysterious axe-murders begin to take place. Joan's psychiatrist, (played by Mitchell Cox, Vice-President of Pepsi!)sleazy farmhand Leonard Kraus, played by George Kennedy, and then Carol's future father-in-law, played by Howard St. John. Naturally, we assume it's Joan, right? Wrong! I won't tell who the real murderer is, but I DID drop a clue earlier on. William Castle directed this Robert &quot;Psycho&quot; Bloch- scripted opus, and it is just what you'd expect from Castle-low-budget, full of cheap shocks, and just plain FUN. Miss Crawford is a hoot to watch, especially in her later films, such as this one.

This movie is about a woman who kills her hubby and his lady friend (he was cheating), and gets sent to an asylum.  20 years later she is released.  All of a sudden, headless bodies start showin' up.  Gee, wonder who's suspected?  Joan, maybe? This movie is amazing.  It  starts in the 40s and ends in the 60s.  That's when Joan gets released.  When you first see her at the beginning of the film (can you believe she  was 60?!?) she looks like a 40s femme fatale.  When she comes back from the  asylum, she looks like a librarian.  Then, her daughter wants her to look  like she did in the 40s, so Joan does.  And promptly loses her marbles.  Favorite moments:  Joan knitting (she had to be goin' 75 miles an hour,  with a cig to boot!), striking her match on a playing record, and  pretending not to be nervous by dancing and clapping her hands.

I love how, in the beginning they just have to say that Lucy is ""7 years older than her husband.""""Strait-Jacket "" was one of the very first movies that I ever saw with Joan so there's a special place in my heart for it. When I first saw this movie I knew very little about Joan and just assumed that it was one of her movies from her MGM days. And of course it didn't help that the picture on the DVD was one of Joan's Lucy Harbin dressed up with that ""Mildred Pierce"" looking wig. I also loved that bangle bracelet that Joan wore. Didn't she look like such a sexy mama? It totally reminded me of the way Joan looked as Sadie Thompson. Although, I don't think Lucy had any tricks up her sleeve!I still love this movie though. Much like the ever-strong and powerful Joan, ""Strait-Jacket"" has totally withstood the test of time. Yes, it's a ludicrous story that would never have seen the light of day if Joan weren't in it but I can't get enough of it. The story is so dramatic and theatrical, not to mention over-the-top and incredibly foolish.The tagline for this movie was: HER HUSBAND...HER ROOM... ......AND ANOTHER WOMAN. That really describes the beginning but it also leaves a lot to be desired because this is not a love story, at all. Joan plays Lucy Harbin, an axe murderer, who paid her dues and is now released in the care of her brother. Unfortunately once Lucy gets out murder still seems to follow her! This certainly isn't an Alfred Hitchcock type of suspense (maybe ""Murder She Wrote?"") But that doesn't matter because all of the performers give strong support to Joan.Some of Joan's costars include:Diane Baker (who was also in ""Della"" and ""The Best of Everything"" with Joan) played Carol (Lucy's daughter)Leif Erickson played Bill Cutler (Lucy's brother)Rochelle Hudson played Emily Cutler (Lucy's sister-in-law)This black and white movie was released by Columbia on January 19, 1964 and is a total of 89 minutes long. It was actually filmed the prior year and Joan started promoting it from the following spring when she appeared on ""I've Got A Secret"" with Betsy Palmer (her costar from, ""Queen Bee."") I enjoy this movie very much because it's a fine example of a 60's horror movie. There's no blood or violence but that didn't stop the producers from claiming that: Strait-Jacket vividly depicts axe murders! It certainly wasn't done vividly, it looked more like Barbie's head getting popped off.Joan made ""Strait-Jacket"" right after her 1963 picture ""The Caretakers."" She also appeared in a slew of other fine suspense and horror projects throughout the 60s and into the 70s which are pretty good. Joan enjoyed acting in movies and later on television. But I think she also chose this particular genre because she always enjoyed science fiction and the supernatural. In 1972 during one of her final interviews Joan said, ""it's interesting how many people have had experiences they're convinced are ESP."" If you're interested in some more of Joan's later projects, I recommend bothI Saw What You Didand ""Dear Joan: We're Going To Scare you to Death.""I found Joan's performance in this movie (like all of her films) to be perfect. Incidentally, many years later, when asked about this movie Joan refused to comment. Only saying, ""they were all terrible [referring to all of the movies she made afterWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?], even the few that I thought might be good. I made them because I needed the money or because I was bored or both. I hope they have been exhibited and are never heard from again. If I weren't a Christian Scientist, and I sawTrogadvertised on a marquee across the street, I think I'd contemplate suicide.""Joan was a perfectionist who was always a constant professional that never gave anyone anything less than all of herself. Joan must have had a natural ability to act because she is one of the most compelling actresses of the twentieth century, however she received no formal training or education in this field. Joan always knew how to make lemonade out of lemons. There are 2 qualities about her that I really respect. First, she always played such versatile roles, running the gambit of high society to street walker. From westerns to comedy to silents to musicals and horror. But what I also appreciate about Joan is that she knew how to bring an otherwise dead script to life. Let's see Bette Davis do that! Sure, Bette Davis and Greta Garbo are much more respected. But they always got the best scripts and best directors and best of everything else. Poor Joan had to make due with what she had. And I think she did pretty well.If you haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for? Go out and get the DVD or wait for it to come on TCM. Remember, don't reveal the surprise shock ending.

I had seen The Damned Don't Cry, Mildred Pierce, and Baby Jane by the time I was 11 and was absolutely in love with Joan Crawford from seeing her movies on AMC.  To me she was the most beautiful, talented, and rather tragic of creatures. Of course, I expected Strait-Jacket to be of the same quality as Baby Jane. What a disappointment it was to me at that time, but now that I look back I see that this film introduced me to another side of Joan Crawford; the rather lonely, sad last years of her life.The Crawford of Baby Jane is remarkably different than the Crawford of Strait-Jacket.  Gone are the subtlety and the last remnants of a great beauty that were still apparent in Baby Jane. Gone is the masterful acting of Mildred Pierce, Humoresque, and even Queen Bee. What is left is a tired shell of Joan Crawford, clinging to the last remains of the glamour; the faded star. Of course, Joan's star has never faded, even 25 years after her death. Her fame was just too great to ever really die during her lifetime or generations after. But although Strait-Jacket appears to be nothing more than a cheap B-movie thriller, it is actually a striking look into the fateful last years of a legend. The movie will leave you thinking for a long, long time after you've seen it. The image of Crawford at the end of her career will burn in your mind.

Basically the movie is about a woman who spent 20 years in an insane asylum for axe murdering her cheating husband and his lover.  Does she resume her murderous ways?  Watch to find out.This movie was written by Robert Bloch, the guy who wrote ""Psycho"", which was made into the classic movie by Alfred Hitchcock.  Strait-Jacket was directed by William Castle.  This black and white cult classic is creepy, campy, and humorous all in one.  It's a B horror movie, but entertaining nonetheless.  This is Joan Crawford late in her career.  She was doing horror movies in the 1960s, accepting parts she wouldn't have accepted earlier in her career.  She was one of the scream queens of the 1960s.  The special effects are cheap, but what can one expect from a B horror movie?  Crawford plays her role extremely well, giving a great (and scary) performance.  She's a little over the top, but this was the character she played.  Watch her light a cigarette by striking a match on a moving record on a record player.  Watch her seduce a guy half her age.  Diane Baker (Marnie, Silence Of The Lambs) also gives a great performance as Crawford's daughter.

And the movie's pretty good too. 20 years ago, Lucy Harbin caught her husband with another woman and chopped them up with an axe. She gets committed to an asylum for the criminally insane. Now, she's released in her daughter's (Diane Baker) care on a farm with other relatives and wouldn't you just know it---someone's at it again, chopping up the extra characters. Poor Joan tries to please her daughter in every way to make up for lost time---but daughter dearest still wants her to look like she did 20 yrs ago---like Sadie Thompson! Well things just get downright messy and there's more murders and screaming and then it all blows open. Someone's crazy alright but it's not our Joan. The extras on this DVD are great. There's a telling interview with Diane Baker and a costume test for Crawford that's hysterical. But wait till you see the ""axe test""!...""Strait-Jacket"" is a must have for fans. Joan (as Lucy) gets all dolled up like an aging hooker, jangling her bracelets and vamping it up while she wonders if she's going off her rocker again.

Joan Crawford was undoubtedly a &quot;star&quot; in the truest sense of the word; in the special features, William Castle and Diane Baker both confirm the many demands and conditions Ms. Crawford placed on the film.  Her performance is definitely camp, but watching her play someone yearning for her youth, it hit home how Crawford's real life was shaping into the fall of a movie goddess.But in the film, notice the strength Crawford and Baker give in their reunion.  Without a word, the two actresses strongly display the range of emotions they are both feeling.Diane Baker, who unlike one reviewer mentioned, had to this point played the innocent young ingenue, e.g. Best of  Everything, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and in this one, she capitalizes on this innocence, so that when the venom comes, it's quite a transition.

Surprising, considering its another Psycho rip-off (I loved Homicidal) about axe decapitations and has Joan Crawford hamming it up in ways you must see to believe, that it left me feeling rather ambivalent at its end.Why?Well, partly its because it doesn't go far enough.  Part of the reason I love William Castle flicks is that Castle was a gimmicks man and a rather enthusiastic one at that.  We all know the stories about Emergo and Percepto and stuff, but that spirit was definitely found inside his movies too.  His films fed us tons of BS but managed to present it all in such a way that we rolled right along with it despite our knowing better.  What made it all the more crazy and fun was that Castle would then have the audacity to explain away this unbelievable, only-possible-in-a-movie type stuff we just saw with hilariously ordinary ""twist"" explanations that don't even BEGIN to cover what we just saw.  Again, all in an enthusiastic, shameless way that somehow was endearing instead of irritating.Need an example (spoilers, ho!)?  How about in Castle's House on Haunted Hill, where a recently murdered character's ""ghost"" floats outside the window and sends a rope floating up through the window bars and around the other girls legs, something no human could possibly do, only to have it revealed later that murdered character is actually still alive and just used a hanging harness with the help of one other person (with no explanation even offered for the magic rope) to scare the other girl into a violent hysteria?Or in Homicidal when the twist is revealed that the girl and her boyfriend are actually the same woman even though when she's dressed as the man her voice is OBVIOUSLY DUBBED OVER BY A MAN THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE?!?!?!These are the kind of twists and reveals that people don't see coming mostly because they're too ballsy and ridiculous that most people don't expect Castle and Co. to actually try them.That kind of audacious personality is, sadly, much more subdued in Strait-Jacket.  Sure, the story has plot holes, twists, too simple explanations for said twists, etc. just like the other Castle movies I've seen, but all those elements are much smaller, much less crazy, and in the case of the twist, so blatantly obvious that most of the tension is gone before it starts.Its a shame, really, since again its a William Castle movie about axe murders written by the guy who wrote Psycho and staring Joan ""No more wire hangers!"" Crawford.  This shoulda been a slam dunk!  Instead, as Castle movies go, its kinda weak.What DOES make it entertaining, however, is Crawford.  She's pretty unbelievable, and while she spends the whole movie being super over the top, there's true talent in that performance.  Everyone can act bad, it takes a truly good actor to provide the kind of ridiculous performance you see here.  I honestly mean that as a compliment.If you see Strait-Jacket, you'll get a jaw-dropping performance from Joan Crawford in an otherwise lesser movie, so if you're looking to see your first William Castle movie, start with House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, or Homicidal first.",3,"Not the best Castle, but moderately fun anyways...",1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,3287,"['fourth', 'William', 'Castle', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Tingler', 'Homicidal', 'being', 'other', 'three', 'easily', 'least', 'Surprising', 'considering', 'Psycho', 'rip-off', 'loved', 'Homicidal', 'axe', 'decapitations', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'hamming', 'up', 'ways', 'must', 'see', 'believe', 'left', 'feeling', 'rather', 'ambivalent', 'end.Why', 'Well', 'partly', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'Part', 'reason', 'love', 'William', 'Castle', 'flicks', 'Castle', 'was', 'gimmicks', 'man', 'rather', 'enthusiastic', 'one', 'know', 'stories', 'Emergo', 'Percepto', 'stuff', 'spirit', 'was', 'definitely', 'found', 'movies', 'too', 'films', 'fed', 'tons', 'BS', 'managed', 'present', 'way', 'rolled', 'right', 'knowing', 'better', 'What', 'made', 'more', 'crazy', 'fun', 'was', 'Castle', 'would', 'then', 'have', 'audacity', 'explain', 'away', 'unbelievable', 'only-possible-in-a-movie', 'type', 'stuff', 'just', 'saw', 'hilariously', 'ordinary', 'twist', 'explanations', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'BEGIN', 'cover', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'Again', 'all', 'enthusiastic', 'shameless', 'way', 'somehow', 'was', 'endearing', 'instead', 'irritating.Need', 'example', 'spoilers', 'ho', 'How', 'Castle', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'where', 'recently', 'murdered', 'character', 'ghost', 'floats', 'window', 'rope', 'floating', 'up', 'window', 'bars', 'other', 'girls', 'legs', 'something', 'human', 'could', 'possibly', 'do', 'only', 'have', 'revealed', 'later', 'murdered', 'character', 'actually', 'still', 'alive', 'just', 'used', 'hanging', 'harness', 'help', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'explanation', 'even', 'offered', 'magic', 'rope', 'scare', 'other', 'girl', 'violent', 'hysteria', 'Homicidal', 'when', 'twist', 'revealed', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'actually', 'same', 'woman', 'even', 'when', 'dressed', 'man', 'voice', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'DUBBED', 'OVER', 'BY', 'A', 'MAN', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'MOVIE', 'are', 'kind', 'twists', 'reveals', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mostly', ""'re"", 'too', 'ballsy', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Castle', 'Co.', 'actually', 'try', 'kind', 'audacious', 'personality', 'sadly', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'Strait-Jacket', 'Sure', 'story', 'plot', 'holes', 'twists', 'too', 'simple', 'explanations', 'said', 'twists', 'etc', 'just', 'other', 'Castle', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elements', 'are', 'much', 'smaller', 'much', 'less', 'crazy', 'case', 'twist', 'so', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'most', 'tension', 'gone', 'shame', 'really', 'again', 'William', 'Castle', 'movie', 'axe', 'murders', 'written', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'Psycho', 'staring', 'Joan', 'No', 'more', 'wire', 'hangers', 'Crawford', 'shoulda', 'been', 'slam', 'dunk', 'Instead', 'Castle', 'movies', 'go', 'kinda', 'weak.What', 'DOES', 'make', 'entertaining', 'however', 'Crawford', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'whole', 'movie', 'being', 'super', 'top', 'true', 'talent', 'performance', 'Everyone', 'can', 'act', 'bad', 'truly', 'good', 'actor', 'provide', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'performance', 'see', 'here', 'honestly', 'mean', 'compliment.If', 'see', 'Strait-Jacket', ""'ll"", 'get', 'jaw-dropping', 'performance', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'otherwise', 'lesser', 'movie', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'see', 'first', 'William', 'Castle', 'movie', 'start', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Tingler', 'Homicidal', 'first']",N/A

Crawford was actually as fascinating on her way to her twilight years as she was during her halycon days at MGM's and Warners.She was the ultimate star and unemployment for her was never an option. She had a burning desire to work even if it meant she had to turn to horror and suspense, roles which she would never consider during her reign at Warners when she made superlative films such as Mildred Pierce, Possessed and Sudden Fear.But as she approached her 60's, meaty roles were hard to come by, therefore she just had to accept these roles which many fans and critics dismissed as potboilers and not worthy of her megawatt status as the star. Crawford actually convinced herself these were quality scripts and worthy of her. Why not? She was Joan Crawford, idol of millions, conqueror of men. She wasn't ready yet to relinquish her throne to Elizabeth Taylor or a Marilyn Monroe whom she found unbearable.As Saint Joan of Crawford, she imbued her acting on these films as though she was acting alongside Clark Gable. Clearly, she was the star of these films and everything had to revolve around her, perhaps thinking that by doing this, she will elevate these horror flicks to something more than it really is. Crawford is not completely wrong.One of these is Strait-Jacket, written by Bloch who penned ""Psycho"", directed by William Castle who saw ""Baby Jane"" fifteen times. Joan Blondell was supposed to play Lucy Harbin till a freak accident required several stitches on her foot. Enter Ms Joan Crawford.Story is somewhat familiar, wife found husband in bed with a another woman, wife, in a demented delirious moment killed the two using an axe whilst daughter watched in horror, wife locked up in an asylum. After twenty years, wife, now a mother of a twenty three year old daughter released from institution came to live with daughter and brother and sister-in-law, then a series of similar axe murders occur. Is mother the culprit?Crawford at 60 had to play a role of a young mother in her late twenties in flash back sequences as well as play a mother in her late forties and no one but no one has the courage to do this except Crawford. She is extremely brave to have the age of the characters she were playing altered and reduced dramatically.She's not ready yet to play an old woman! Clearly, she is Queen of Hollywood and Queen of Camp. Her performance is over-baked and over the top that one just has to sit back and enjoy. Strait-jacket is no Mildred Pierce or Possessed nor is it the turkey that many people were expecting.It is Joan Crawford show all the way from the moment she got off that train in a grand entrance that is so out of sync with the entire theme of the film complete with over-done music. The wig, the frock and those dangling fancy bracelets! Every scene Crawford is in,she chews the scenery and characters are tossed aside for her dramatic moments bathed in diffused lighting. Every Crawfordesque movement, gait, eyebrows and manners are present.Scene where Crawford was flirting outrageouly with her daughter's fiancee has gone down in Hollywood folklore as one of the campest scenes ever, again out-of-sync with the theme of the movie. Even Pepsi's are seen visibly on one scene (Crawford was married to Alfred Steele, President of Pepsi Cola.)Film was a hit due in part to Crawford's personal theatre appearances (complete with a 3-foot axe!), seizing her final moment of glory under the sun.The DVD looks fine and sounds very good, almost surround quality.Interviews with Diane Baker and critics are of interest as well. Watch also the wardrobe testing. It's a hoot!Watch Strait-jacket on a nice evening on your pyjamas with a nice glass of wine. Don't take the story seriously. Its a different story with Crawford.

She grabs an axe and decapitates both.If she had a good lawyer in this day and age, she'd probably get a ""justifiable homicide"" defense and maybe spend a few years in jail. But this is the 60s, so she gets locked up in an institution for 20 years (as Lucy/Joan will say later, ""an asylum"").Her brother and sister-in-law take in Carol (played by sweet faced Diane Baker) and move far away. This way Carol can have as normal a life as possible without the other kids teasing and taunting her. This is all explained in a voice over by Carol to her fiancee' because Lucy/Joan is finally out of the institution and coming there to live.Carol is happy to finally be reunited with her mother. Of course, Lucy/Joan has aged in 20 ears. The younger Lucy wore brightly colored, tight dresses, lots of jangly bracelets and generally looked more like a street walker than a mom. The older Lucy, well, she's all gray along with her clothes. Carol wants the old Mom back, so she takes Lucy shopping to buy that type of outfit, a wig and jewelry to bring back the younger Lucy.I won't go into the scene where Lucy meets her daughter's much younger fiancee' but it is totally creepy.  Everybody else has described it, but you won't get the full impact of it until you see the scene yourself. Carol is not the only uncomfortable person watching this scene, the viewer is very uncomfortable. Looks like Lucy was a ""cougar"" before the word meant what it currently means.Lucy's psychiatrist played by Mitchell Cox, Vice-President of Pepsi at that time) shows up and this starts to cause problems. Lucy is extremely upset at his appearance. The shrink tells Carol that dear old Mom should go back to the institution. Somehow the shrink never manages to take Lucy back because he ran into the sharp blade of an axe.And the sleazy farmhand (George Kennedy, I would never have guessed) gets a little suspicious of the goings on at the farm. Carol tells him he's fired, but he just laughs it off. He seems to know more than what he is letting on but he also runs into the sharp side of an axe. How clumsy are these people;)Lucy gets to meet Carol's future inlaws and that does not go well. Apparently Carol is not what they want their son to marry. Especially after they find out that Lucy has spent 20 years in an asylum.  Somehow, Carol's future father-in-law also runs into the sharp side of an axe.William Castle directs this film from a script by Robert Bloch (""Psycho""). It's doesn't have an elaborate budget for special effects, but you got Joan Crawford practically frothing at the mouth, what else do you need? It's great fun to watch Joan in all her acting glory - she makes the film.I recommend this film highly for any fans of Joan Crawford or William Castle.It's great to see a horror movie that doesn't rely on gore and guts, plus it's just enjoyable.

The plot has been rehashed in previous reviews, so I can get to the heart of the matter here. Joan plays an ex-axe murderess with typical fury, beautifully combined with a poignancy which may be completely unexpected, but nevertheless completely appropriate. Well supported by the underrated Diane Baker, Leif Erikson, Rochelle Hudson and George Kennedy, she gives meaning and depth to what otherwise would have been just another horror film. Whether playing scenes with daughter Baker's boyfriend (John Anthony Hayes) or his snobbish parents, (Howard St, John and Edith Atwater), Crawford is on the money, using her years of experience to transcend her material.

Long gone is the sleek, stylish, achingly beautiful Joan of Mildred Pierce, and what takes her place is something akin to a Harpy, all eyebrows and lips and venom.Yet, for all of that, in Strait-Jacket, Joan manages to turn what could so easily have been just another William Castle mediocrity-fest, into a very enjoyable film, via one of her best performances as disaster-plagued farmer's wife, Lucy Harbin.The plot is thin but totally sufficient - Joan murders vile Husband and Mistress, Joan is locked up for 20 years, Joan is released, and more murders take place. Sounds straightforward enough. However, it's the contrast between tender emotion and outright rage that Crawford so beautifully portrays in her role as Lucy that lifts this film out of the ranks of B-Movie and makes it one of Crawford's finest hours.Her supporting cast are perfunctory, with the exception of a strong performance by Diane Baker as Joan's supportive daughter, and the utterly miscast and woeful John Anthony Hayes as Doctor Anderson, a Pepsi-Cola executive who fancied himself an Actor. Thankfully, his part is minute, and doesn't colour any of the scenes in this otherwise fine thriller.If Bette Davis considered herself a better Actress than Crawford, and indeed, for movie fans in general who consider Crawford a lesser being, check this out.

I remember being quite enamored with Joan Crawford--whom, my mother said, was a ""big star""--and, of course, I'd already seen her ghastly turn in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.""  But nothing prepared me for this! From its shocking opening scene (the sound of breaking glass, and then a shot of Crawford tied up on a stretcher screaming ""I'm not insane!"") to its sitcom-sweet ending, ""Strait-Jacket"" has to be seen to be truly appreciated. It's your typical story of a small town floozy, straight from the Bette Davis ""Beyond the Forest"" school of acting. Joan's the said floozy, Lucy Harbin, who happens to be married to young stud, Lee Majors. Well, Lee's been fooling around with another trollop, and as we all know, you just don't do that to Joan Crawford! When Lucy finds out, she grabs an axe (after conveniently stumbling over it) and chops the trollop and filandering husband to bits. This is the only film where people are decapitated so smoothly--their heads literally pop off! Anyway, Lucy gets committed to a mental hospital, is released 20 years later, and her ""oh-so-caring"" young daughter (Diane Baker, completely unbelievable) takes her in. So what does caring daughter do? She convinces Lucy to wear a black wig, a truly horrid print dress, eyelashes out to there, and jangly bracelets that would weigh down King Kong. Well, this really sets Lucy off. She begins hearing a child chanting ""Lucy Harbin took an axe..."" and freaks out in the dressing room of a chintzy women's shop. Then, if this wasn't enough, she seduces her daughter's boyfriend (a scene that defies description--read the other reviews!), knits a sweater, gyrates to a sleazy jazz record, and screams, with her eyes brimming tears! I swear, it's Mildred Pierce on speed! Oh, yeah, and there's also another decapitation--this time of the grubby farm hand--and again, his head pops off, nice and neat-like. I find it hard to believe that ""Straight-Jacket"" did anything to further Joan Crawford's career.  In real life, she may have swathed herself in mink and downed gallons of 100 proof vodka, but on screen, she slid slowly into self-parody.

Joan is in almost every scene and with the exception of two characters who emote distress a few times, Joan's emotions are barely contained and often explode out of the box. Fascinatingly, she often does act quite well but then goes over the top. I was shocked beyond belief with her crazed scenes, especially her bugged out, shifting eyes as she whacks off her husband, her constant jitters when she wears a ridiculous outfit and pop-on wig that replicates her dress and hair when she ki lled her husband, and after a few sips of whiskey in that get up, she tries t o seduce her daughter is very young fiance, even putting her fingers in his mouth, while her daughter watches in distress from the sofa. She must have learned from ""Who's Afraid of Baby Jane"" that the more bizarre the performance, the more attention you get which can lead to a possible Oscar nomination. Joan went all out in this strategy far beyond belief. George Kennedy, the farmhand, deserves a mention in the supporting role of crazy: I was actually startled when I first glimpsed him on film, looking like a a deranged zombie on a bad hair day, with acting to match.The special features alone are worth the price of admission! ""Battle- Ax: The Making of Straitjacket"" is has priceless comments, such as Joan's requirement that the set was set to 0 degrees so her makeup wouldn't fall off! While the test scenes of her swinging the axe with a rather determined look on her face, the screen tests for her entire wardrobe were hilarious as she actually was acting over the top but without irony.

336043,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302799171,Simon Davis,"[2, 2]","Of all the horror efforts Joan Crawford produced after her great success opposite long time adversary Bette Davis in 1962's ""Whatever happened To Baby Jane?"", this little black and white thriller ""Strait-Jacket"", from 1964 is my absolute favourite. This film certainly does not enjoy a good reputation along with all of Joan's other 1960's efforts however I find myself coming back to it time and again and I really appreciate it on a number of levels. Of course there is the camp element that seems to come with the package when you are looking at any veteran Hollywood actresses work during the 1960's. However being a great admirer of Joan Crawford's work even in her less celebrated acting assignments I can also appreciate this film for the way in which Joan gives her all to a part that probably doesn't warrant that amount of effort in the first place. It results however in a movie that despite it's small budget and obvious plot holes still manages to actually deliver quite a few thrills along the way in an admittedly ""B"" grade story.Joan Crawford plays Lucy Harbin who in a flash back sequence we see unexpectedly finds her young husband (Lee Majors in a very early role),in bed with another woman. In a deranged frenzy she seizes an axe and proceeds to hack both of them to death in front of her young child Carol (Diane Baker). Lucy is judged criminally insane and sent to an asylum where she remains for 20 years. Carol in the meantime is sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt, Bill and Emily Cutler (Leif Erickson and Rochelle Hudson), on their farm and that is where Lucy returns when she is released on a trial to see if she can cope in the world. Lucy has great trouble in adjusting to life on the farm and even Carol's ""kindness"", towards her which involves her getting new clothes and a younger looking wig fails to help her condition. Lucy begins to be haunted by terrible nightmares where she imagines that the severed heads of her husband and his mistress are lying on her bed and she seems to imagine that while she is out shopping with Carol children in the street are calling her name and making fun of her chopping peoples heads off. Carol has a young male friend Michael (John Anthony Hayes), who she hopes to marry however a visit by Michael to the house turns into a disaster when Lucy begins drinking and comes on to the young man humiliating Carol. Things go from bad to worse however when the asylum doctor visits the farm and when he mysteriously disappears it looks like Lucy's old murderous streak has returned. Before long the murders begin to pile up with nosy farm hand Leo (George Kennedy), being killed by an axe and on a very unsuccessful visit to Michael's parents Lucy reveals where she has been for the last 20 years which horrifies Mrs Fields (Edith Atwater) and results in Lucy running out of the house in a rage. Mr Fields (Howard St. John ),however soon meets a grisly end in his dressing room and when everything points to Lucy having struck again the very shocking and unexpected truth is revealed on just who has been committing all these murders and for what reason. The tragic details help clear Lucy who it is revealed was simply an innocent pawn in anothers unbalanced plans for the future.A brain child of Theatre showman William Castle who was justly famous for wiring audiences seats in theatres to give them a light shock during tense moments in his films, ""Strait-Jacket"", actually has some fine credentials in among all the shlock on display being written by Robert Bloch who was responsible for the classic ""Psycho"", and Amicus' multi story production of ""The House that Dripped Blood"". Never could this effort be called a classic however it is alot of fun to watch and is helped tremendously by its veteran cast of gifted performers. Joan Crawford never found that great success story in films again after ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" in 1962 however she gives her all here in the role of the axe wielding Lucy like Oscars were being given out in abundance that year. She manages the almost impossible here of injecting in among the sensationalism an element of vulnerability into her performance that does create sympathy for her character along the way. Every emotion in the acting book is employed by Crawford in ""Strait-Jacket"", from sadness, to manical frenzy, to outright fury, to self assured seductiveness, to tortured uncertainity. She has a field day with all these over the top emotions and so too do we as the audience. It might not be regarded as a very dignified role for this legendary dramatic actress to play but it is a sad illustration of what most of the veteran actresses from Hollywood's heyday were forced to accept in the 1960's if they wished to continue in leading roles. Diane Baker was an interesting and very talented young actress in the late 1950's and 60's and she worked with Joan Crawford three times in those years, twice playing her daughter. She has a great chemistry with Crawford and her rather angelic appearance serves her very well here when she is revealed to not be everything that she first seems. Leif Erickson and Rochelle Hudson were both Hollywood veterans from the 1930's and they are also excellent as Lucy's brother and sister in law who dont really know what to expect when Lucy comes to live with them. Filmed in a grainy and rather drab black and white that choice actually suits this story very well. This harsh photography succeeds perfectly in the scenes of Joan Crawford's bizarre transformation into the woman she was 20 years when she is taken shopping by her ""caring daughter"", where she acquires a garish print dress, huge dangling jewellery and a horriblly unflattering jet black fright wig that gives her character a slightly deranged look. The famous scene of Joan trying to seduce her daughter's fiance has certainly gone down into camp folklore and has an amusing shock quality to it however for me being a huge Crawford fan it evokes a rather sad impression when I can't help but recall the Joan Crawford of her MGM glory days teaming with the likes of Clark Gable and Robert Taylor in that legendary studio's glossy productions.The secret to enjoying ""Strait-Jacket"", is to never for one moment take it seriously and just sit back and enjoy the fun filled ride. I love all the efforts by the likes of Crawford, Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck made during this time generally for people like William Castle. They helped create a curious sub genre that only lasted during the 1960's where veteran actresses where given these scenery chewing parts in horror/thriller ""camp"", efforts often of dubious quality. ""Strait-Jacket"", is I feel one of the more interesting of the batch due largely to the presense of Joan Crawford and the interesting supporting cast. No classic by any means its a fun romp with a few quite suspenseful moments before its not entirely unexpected conclusion. Long before the famous quote ""Tina! Bring me the axe!"" became forever associated with Joan Crawford in camp folklore, she was showing expertise with the real thing in William Castle's little 1964 horror effort ""Strait-Jacket"".

While he may not have succeeded in making the A list, this movie isn't less entertaining for it.

It is actually quite a good film. The script could be a bit stronger, but it is entertaining and interesting. The movie is really the last great film of Crawford's career and if the movie hadn't been a horror film she would have certainly received an Oscar nod. This may have been only a B movie but Crawford gives it her all turning in an A plus performance. Even after filming Crawford believed she gave the greatest performance ever although several years down the road she detested the film. But it's truely a good film. The movie also has TV's ""Six Million Dollar Man"" Lee Majors in an uncredited role as Crawford's husband who has an affair and is untimately killed by her with an ax. That story is enough to make anyone interested in the movie. The finale is quite fun and exciting and I simply loved Crawford in the role. The DVD is beautifully restored with some great bonus features most notably a documentary on the movie featuring Diane Baker who would later star in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".

She looks as if she crancked her own personal acting switch up to 11, and let 'er rip. She also alternates between wearing a grey wig and a frumpy muu-muu to a tight dress, black wig and about forty pounds of bangle bracelets (How could she have snuck up on anyone who was not in a coma making all that noise?), all of which succeeds in making her look twenty years older than she looks as an old woman!Wildly inappropriate line readings were a hallmark of Joan's performances in later years- but these are the best.

And though other reviewers have mentioned it, the scene where she comes on to said son-in-law is jaw dropping; she starts out downing about a milk jug full of bourbon, drags the poor boy over to the sofa and sits him down by shoving him with her hips- while having him in a death-grip- drawling &quot;I wouldn't want my daughter to think I was moving in on her fella&quot; then proceeds to stand across the room from him and give him a pick-up look more appropriate to the leather bar scenes in &quot;Cruising&quot; than to an early 60's B movie. The rest of the cast just sit there, visibly aghast at the spectacle.

Crawford's ambition to work in her later years meant doing these kind of flicks, but it's actually worth owning for many reasons.  Crawford's acting is sensational, the trampy scenes when she tries to seduce her daughter's fiance, and the unexpected ending.  There's also the extras on the DVD which are great including interviews with Diane Baker now.  Also shown is rare footage of Crawford doing public promo's for the movie.  For some strange reason they have released most of her later films on DVD overlooking alot of the middle films like Mildred pierce - I think a lot of people are waiting for that one.But you cant go wrong buying Strait Jacket for your collection.

There are a lot of clear similarities between this film and Psycho (e.g. waxed figures instead of stuffed animals)and the  strucure of the farmhouse in which two of the killings occur resembles the  Bates Motel so the ending didn't surprise me at all.  It's very interesting  to compare this with Psycho 2 (made in 1983) which has a very similar story  for much of the time.  But this is Crawford and not Anthony Perkins and  things have to be re-written accordingly.  I love the opening description  of her as &quot;very much a woman and very much aware of the fact&quot; and  the hilarious scene in which she gets drunk and flirts with her daughter's  fiance.  Check out Berserk, made 3 years later, which also features  mysterious killings with Crawford as the main suspect and which has a  pretty similar ending.",3,Variations on a theme of Psycho,962841600,"07 6, 2000",2000,911,"['screenplay', 'Robert', 'Bloch', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'book', 'film', 'Psycho', 'based', 'are', 'lot', 'clear', 'similarities', 'film', 'Psycho', 'e.g', 'waxed', 'figures', 'instead', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'strucure', 'farmhouse', 'two', 'killings', 'occur', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'very', 'interesting', 'compare', 'Psycho', '2', 'made', '1983', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'much', 'time', 'Crawford', 'not', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'things', 'have', 'be', 're-written', 'accordingly', 'love', 'opening', 'description', 'quot', 'very', 'much', 'woman', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'fact', 'quot', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'drunk', 'flirts', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'Check', 'out', 'Berserk', 'made', '3', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'mysterious', 'killings', 'Crawford', 'main', 'suspect', 'pretty', 'similar', 'ending']",N/A
