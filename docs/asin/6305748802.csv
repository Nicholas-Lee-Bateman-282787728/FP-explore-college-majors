475424,A4KJTS5P78ICU,6305748802,K. Futrell,"[1, 1]",I am 16 years old and S Club 7 is the best series I've ever watched.  This series isn't only for children.  Even if your older you will still get a lot of laughs out of it.  This series is about S Club 7 trying to get started in the music business. They overcome a lot of obstacles throughout this series.  S Club 7's old manager told them that he was sending them to the best Hotel in Miami and it turns out to be the biggest dump.  They work for the worst person named Howard.  He makes them keep up the hotel and he says singing is only for fun.  He is so into himself that he can't even remember any of the S Club names.  5 stars being the best I definetely give it 5 stars.,5,The Best Show on TV and Video,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,678,"['am', '16', 'years', 'old', 'S', 'Club', '7', 'best', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'series', ""n't"", 'only', 'children', 'Even', 'older', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'lot', 'laughs', 'series', 'S', 'Club', '7', 'trying', 'get', 'started', 'music', 'business', 'overcome', 'lot', 'obstacles', 'series', 'S', 'Club', '7', 'old', 'manager', 'told', 'was', 'sending', 'best', 'Hotel', 'Miami', 'out', 'be', 'biggest', 'dump', 'work', 'worst', 'person', 'named', 'Howard', 'keep', 'hotel', 'singing', 'only', 'fun', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'S', 'Club', 'names', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'best', 'definetely', 'give', '5', 'stars']",S Club 7 in Miami Vol 01 VHS
475425,A24LC7KJEBS4YI,6305748802,"Maurine ""mo""","[2, 2]","This video is like their album: fun. The video contains about 16 minutes of behind the scenes on their show and three episodes of about 20 minutes each. The group has been sent to a Miami hotel to perform by their bad  manager. Along with singing, the 7 must put up with the crusty hotel  manager and his silly sidekick/brother. The 7 get into various situations.  In one, they buy a car that breaks down. Another, a hurricane threatens the  hotel. Together, the 7 get through everything. In each episode S Club  perform at least one song, with their songs playing in the background while  they go about their various adventures. One of the things that I like is  the genuine affection they have for each other. They do okay on the acting,  but then again they are playing themselves. Or rather, cariacatures of  themselves. Rachel is displayed as a mini-Posh Spice all into hair, makeup,  and clothes. Jo is a regular mechanic. Jon is out to save the animals.  All  in all, a fun 105 minutes.",4,Fun x 7,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,993,"['video', 'album', 'fun', 'video', '16', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'show', 'three', 'episodes', '20', 'minutes', 'group', 'been', 'sent', 'Miami', 'hotel', 'perform', 'bad', 'manager', 'singing', '7', 'must', 'put', 'up', 'crusty', 'hotel', 'manager', 'silly', 'sidekick/brother', '7', 'get', 'various', 'situations', 'one', 'buy', 'car', 'down', 'hurricane', 'hotel', 'Together', '7', 'get', 'everything', 'episode', 'S', 'Club', 'perform', 'least', 'one', 'song', 'songs', 'playing', 'background', 'go', 'various', 'adventures', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'genuine', 'affection', 'have', 'other', 'do', 'okay', 'acting', 'then', 'again', 'are', 'playing', 'rather', 'cariacatures', 'Rachel', 'displayed', 'mini-Posh', 'Spice', 'hair', 'makeup', 'clothes', 'Jo', 'regular', 'mechanic', 'Jon', 'out', 'save', 'animals', 'fun', '105', 'minutes']",S Club 7 in Miami Vol 01 VHS
475426,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6305748802,Only-A-Child,"[2, 4]","If you are reading this and wondering what the heck a ""S Club 7"" actually is, then you are probably a fan of either Rachel Stevens or Hannah Spearritt looking for things they did early in their careers. Rachel and Hannah appear to be the only members of the cast who have been visible in the industry since the BBC show ended and the group broke up.I say ""group"" because the premise of the thing is that they are a seven member musical group-imagine ""The A-Teens"" playing the main characters on ""Hangtime"" and you will have a pretty good idea of the concept. Like ""Hangtime"" they placed a premium on diversity although they shot themselves in the foot by turning the black guy into a ""step-and-fetch-it"" caricature who is patronized by the other six members of the group.The ""Miami 7"" tape opens with the group's first performance at a Florida resort. This becomes unintentionally hilarious when the owner makes them do ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon"" as their first song. Then they rebel and insist on doing their own songs-the producers try to dial up the contrast between the geriatric first number and the youthful zest of their natural style. Amusingly, other than exposing their abs there is almost no difference since the ""S Club 7"" style is just an updated version of ""Tony Orlando and Dawn"".Although the group actually had some hits, the BBC show just reveals their acting and performing inadequacies. The 1999 ""Miami 7"" episodes on the VHS tape have some historical interest because even a casual observer can see that Rachel and Hannah stand out from from the others talent-wise and charisma-wise.A word of warning-although the VHS tape I watched was new it would not play smoothly and jammed frequently, the only tape that has ever done this in my player.Then again, what do I know?
