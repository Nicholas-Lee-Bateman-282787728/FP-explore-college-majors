He was an artistic storyteller; a talent humanly revered and required. Through MYTHOS II Campbell weaves all religions/philosophies together in order to provide the viewer not with instruction, but with doorways to discover their own spiritualism. As Mark Twain consistently directed; everyone should develop his or her own religion. Through MYTHOS I & II the viewer is walked through multiple philosophies, their development and how to develop one's own.Thought stimuli are vital to human spiritual development and Mr. Campbell provided the tour through space and time. Not once does he impose his informative lectures, but instead opens the flower of possibilities one petal at a time. For me it was Campbell's books that spontaneously combusted my spiritual catharsis that had been in the developing process for many moons. In conjunction with a plethora of writers and artists I methodically developed through fiction NOT ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" but 'The HEROINE with Multiple Countenances' in my 4 novels guaranteed to charge a new and improved attitude:Hear the Calliope: A sentimental journey on the Earth RideLegacy: Let the games begin (Volume 2)Reason Void of Reason: Spirituality Honeymoon Style (Volume 3)BREATHE: Noumenon (Volume 4)",5,Metaphysics,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1326,"['secret', 'impact', 'Joesph', 'Campbell', 'work', 'had', 'listeners', 'was', 'artistic', 'storyteller', 'talent', 'humanly', 'revered', 'required', 'MYTHOS', 'II', 'Campbell', 'religions/philosophies', 'together', 'order', 'provide', 'viewer', 'not', 'instruction', 'doorways', 'discover', 'own', 'spiritualism', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'consistently', 'directed', 'everyone', 'should', 'develop', 'own', 'religion', 'MYTHOS', 'II', 'viewer', 'walked', 'multiple', 'philosophies', 'development', 'how', 'develop', 'one', 'own.Thought', 'stimuli', 'are', 'vital', 'human', 'spiritual', 'development', 'Mr.', 'Campbell', 'provided', 'tour', 'space', 'time', 'Not', 'once', 'impose', 'informative', 'lectures', 'instead', 'flower', 'possibilities', 'one', 'petal', 'time', 'was', 'Campbell', 'books', 'spontaneously', 'combusted', 'spiritual', 'catharsis', 'had', 'been', 'developing', 'process', 'many', 'moons', 'conjunction', 'plethora', 'writers', 'artists', 'methodically', 'developed', 'fiction', 'NOT', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'Faces', ""'The"", 'HEROINE', 'Multiple', 'Countenances', '4', 'novels', 'guaranteed', 'charge', 'new', 'improved', 'attitude', 'Hear', 'Calliope', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'Earth', 'RideLegacy', 'Let', 'games', 'begin', 'Volume', '2', 'Reason', 'Void', 'Reason', 'Spirituality', 'Honeymoon', 'Style', 'Volume', '3', 'BREATHE', 'Noumenon', 'Volume', '4']",Mythos II: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition

College ""Sayman""","[6, 6]","I have to concur with other reviewers - I found Campbell's lecture very interesting, but the interludes by Susan Sarandon were just plain annoying.Campbell's lecture was unscripted and ""off the cuff"", but years of oration shows in a compelling delivery. Susan's sounded liked she was reading a children's book to the viewer.Perhaps the producers thought they needed to ""dumb-down"" the content while featuring some celebrity talent to help sell the video.Nothing against Susan Sarandon, people!

1141790,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B0013F60G4,Zarathustra,"[23, 24]","I first encountered Joseph Campbell on the PBS series The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers in 1988, as did many people. I was questioning my protestant upbringing and that series was like a thunderbolt coming out of the blue for me. What impressed me the most with The Power of Myth was the reaction of Moyers, a longtime Baptist minister, to Campbell's analysis. He was at first shocked, then disbelieving and finally accepting of Campbell's views. Unfortunately that DVD is no longer in print, but I still have the book.The Mythos DVD set is a series of lectures given just before Campbell's death. Mythos I is a good introduction to mythology, but Mythos II gets right to the heart of comparative religion.Campbell's main point is that religious ideas are valuable as myth, but when they are turned into doctrines they are harmful. For example, when Christian fundamentalists deny Darwin and evolution because the bible says the Earth was created in 6 days, they are turning a myth into doctrine and in the process are denying the best scientific theory we have. As myth the creation story is valuable, but as doctrine it is a disaster.In Mythos II Campbell examines Buddhism and Hinduism in depth and compares them with Judaism, Christianity, and other religions. This is a set, released last year in HD, that is worth watching many times.",5,The Summit of Comparative Religion,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1341,"['first', 'encountered', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'PBS', 'series', 'Power', 'Myth', 'Bill', 'Moyers', '1988', 'did', 'many', 'people', 'was', 'questioning', 'protestant', 'upbringing', 'series', 'was', 'thunderbolt', 'coming', 'blue', 'What', 'impressed', 'most', 'Power', 'Myth', 'was', 'reaction', 'Moyers', 'longtime', 'Baptist', 'minister', 'Campbell', 'analysis', 'was', 'first', 'shocked', 'then', 'disbelieving', 'finally', 'accepting', 'Campbell', 'views', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'longer', 'print', 'still', 'have', 'book.The', 'Mythos', 'DVD', 'set', 'series', 'lectures', 'given', 'just', 'before', 'Campbell', 'death', 'Mythos', 'good', 'introduction', 'mythology', 'Mythos', 'II', 'right', 'heart', 'comparative', 'religion.Campbell', 'main', 'point', 'religious', 'ideas', 'are', 'valuable', 'myth', 'when', 'are', 'turned', 'doctrines', 'are', 'harmful', 'example', 'when', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'deny', 'Darwin', 'evolution', 'bible', 'Earth', 'was', 'created', '6', 'days', 'are', 'turning', 'myth', 'doctrine', 'process', 'are', 'denying', 'best', 'scientific', 'theory', 'have', 'myth', 'creation', 'story', 'valuable', 'doctrine', 'disaster.In', 'Mythos', 'II', 'Campbell', 'Buddhism', 'Hinduism', 'depth', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'other', 'religions', 'set', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'HD', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'times']",Mythos II: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition
