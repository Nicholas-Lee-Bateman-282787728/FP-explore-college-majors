I've only seen this twice and since most of the songs are unfamiliar, I'm sure the rating will go up as I hear it more often. These arias are still solid, of course, and Bocelli's voice is as good as ever. The visuals just aren't as colorful.The church in which this concert was filmed is magnificent and I would have liked to have seen more of it. It is the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, Italy. A better job of making the visuals more interesting would have made this DVD concert more attractive.I've never been a fan of opera but anyone can convert me, it's this guy. ""Sacred Arias"" is what I would call low-key opera. Interspersed here and there in the concert are scenes of Bocelli and his family, and his country.In all, a soothing and pleasing concert. It won't knock your socks off like Andrea's first DVD, but it's still a quality concert DVD.",4,"Classy In Every Sense, But Unspectacula",1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,1031,"['did', ""n't"", 'rate', 'nearly', 'as', 'high', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'first', 'filmed', 'concert', 'maybe', 'one', 'was', 'presented', 'so', 'well', 'others', 'can', 'never', 'match', 'up', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'twice', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'unfamiliar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'rating', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'hear', 'more', 'often', 'arias', 'are', 'still', 'solid', 'course', 'Bocelli', 'voice', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'visuals', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'colorful.The', 'church', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'magnificent', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Basilica', 'Santa', 'Maria', 'sopra', 'Minerva', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'A', 'better', 'job', 'making', 'visuals', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'concert', 'more', 'attractive.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'opera', 'anyone', 'can', 'convert', 'guy', 'Sacred', 'Arias', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'low-key', 'opera', 'Interspersed', 'here', 'there', 'concert', 'are', 'scenes', 'Bocelli', 'family', 'country.In', 'soothing', 'pleasing', 'concert', 'wo', ""n't"", 'knock', 'socks', 'Andrea', 'first', 'DVD', 'still', 'quality', 'concert', 'DVD']",N/A

It includes the full 77 minute concert on DVD, plus the two bonus tracks on the DVD, plus the full 72 minute CD.  This includes two bonus tracks on the CD not available on the original CD.  Amazingly, the Special Edition is a few dollars less than the DVD alone.  What a bargain!  This is an amazing concert with a tremendous picture quality on a big screen TV.

483296,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,6305934347,R. Nicholson,"[18, 19]","A beautiful DVD!This disc has the best of everything: my favorite tenor (Andrea Bocelli), my favorite conductor (Myung-Wung Chung) performing at the magnificent Basilica of Santa Marie sopra Minerva in Rome. Accompanying the principals are the Orchestra and Chorus of the National Academy of Di Santa CeciliaAlthough you take for granted that the quality of the singing and the music will be first class, it is however, the excellence of the camera work and the editing that really makes this recording a cut above the rest. The video not only includes close-ups of all participants and many panoramic views both inside and outside the church, but it also seems to be able to capture the essence of the spirituality that the music and the surroundings are trying to convey. There are, for instance, several touchingly beautiful shots of  Bocelli and Chung together, both so enraptured by the music that they seem to be oblivious to their surroundings.Simply put, although the music of this DVD is predominantly sacred, I think that any music lover will find something in this disc that will move them and bring a sense of peace and joy to their  hearts.
