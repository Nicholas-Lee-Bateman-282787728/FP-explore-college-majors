1333295,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B0038VEXUQ,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[2, 3]","The movie is based on the book ""Warrant for X"" by Philip MacDonald. So it has a lot of the same characters as in the movie ""The List of Adrian Messenger"" (1963).The story has changed a tad form the book. Van Johnson plays a blind playwright (they never say how he got blinded) At first being blind seems like a gimmick but you soon get swept up in the film and the great acting by Van Johnson and it seems perfectly normal.Phillip Hannon (Van Johnson) over hears two people plotting something sinister but being blind he does not know what they look like. He tells the authorities but they fluff him off. So with the help of his man Bob Matthews (Cecil Parker) and his ex-betrothed Jean Lennox (Vera Miles) they track down their only lead Miss Alice MacDonald (Patricia Laffan who played Devil Girl From Mars""). We watch as Phil has to use his skills to find the plotters before it is too late.I watch this movie about once a month like clockwork. I know most of the dialog by heart. At one point Phil tells Bob to call Miss Lennox a taxi; I cannot help myself and say ""Miss Lennox you are a taxi"".All kidding aside you will also find yourself watching it again and again for the nuances and some things that seem missing as if they cut something out here and there.Warrant For X (An Anthony Gethryn Mystery)",5,Warrant for X,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,1308,"['movie', 'based', 'book', 'Warrant', 'X', 'Philip', 'MacDonald', 'lot', 'same', 'characters', 'movie', 'List', 'Adrian', 'Messenger', '1963', '.The', 'story', 'changed', 'tad', 'form', 'book', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'blind', 'playwright', 'never', 'say', 'how', 'got', 'blinded', 'first', 'being', 'blind', 'gimmick', 'soon', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'perfectly', 'normal.Phillip', 'Hannon', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'hears', 'two', 'people', 'plotting', 'something', 'sinister', 'being', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'look', 'authorities', 'fluff', 'off', 'So', 'help', 'man', 'Bob', 'Matthews', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'ex-betrothed', 'Jean', 'Lennox', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'track', 'down', 'only', 'lead', 'Miss', 'Alice', 'MacDonald', 'Patricia', 'Laffan', 'who', 'played', 'Devil', 'Girl', 'From', 'Mars', 'watch', 'Phil', 'use', 'skills', 'find', 'plotters', 'too', 'late.I', 'watch', 'movie', 'once', 'month', 'clockwork', 'know', 'most', 'dialog', 'heart', 'one', 'point', 'Phil', 'Bob', 'call', 'Miss', 'Lennox', 'taxi', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'say', 'Miss', 'Lennox', 'are', 'taxi', '.All', 'kidding', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'nuances', 'things', 'seem', 'missing', 'cut', 'something', 'out', 'here', 'there.Warrant', 'X', 'Anthony', 'Gethryn', 'Mystery']",N/A

Zero stars for Pan and Scan.I was excited to see that one of my favorite films was finally released on DVD.  I searched for it on Amazon.  There it was.  The cover even showed Van Johnson and Vera Miles - AND -- in very large print -- CHECK THE COVER IMAGE -- the very distinctive logo ""CINEMASCOPE"" right there on the lower right corner.  Of course, I immediately ordered the DVD.Well, got me again.  Flip over to the back of the keep case.  In printing, I'd estimate to be about 4 points high, there it is:  ""(pan & scan).""  If I'd seen it before opening the package and placing the DVD in the player I would have returned it immediately.  But no, I put it in the player, got the disclaimer about ""edited to fit this screen""  uh-oh, and sure enough, after the initial credits in Cinemascope (black box all the way around) the opening sequence -- which is supposed to be a beautiful view of the River Thames and London Bridge -- is a chopped up mess that looks like a tourist's home movie from 50 years ago.Really, Fox?  The opening credits are in correct proportion.  I could watch it that way or very easily use the zoom feature on either the DVD player or the TV and see the movie as it was made and meant to be seen.  So why chop up the rest of the film?This is a very good film.  Good plot, acting, directing.  Doesn't assume the audience needs everything spelled out -- as is often the case in modern films.I found a WIDESCREEN version for sale on Amazon UK -- Region 2.  It has a predominantly RED cover, and says ""The Hollywood Studio Collection"" on the front.  The best I can find for a company with this name is one registered with the California Secretary of State as an LLC with an address in Chatsworth and/or Northridge.I have purchased the widescreen version.  After it arrives, I will play it I will come back  to this review to add a yea or nay on the Region 2 disc.Fox needs to get with it.

There's a region 4 version and what appears to be a region 2 version. As much as I like this movie, neither is worth the outrageous price of either. It showed up as a first on TCM a few days ago to my joy. 23 Paces to Baker Street holds up well after 50 years.Van Johnson plays Phillip Hannon, a successful and recently blinded playwright now in London. He is embittered and rejects whatever he might feel is pity. One night in a pub he overhears a whispered conversation that he thinks is about something terrible that will happen in ten days. The police think he simply misinterpreted what he heard. His secretary, Bob Mathews (played by Cecil Parker), gives him the benefit of the doubt and is prepared to help. Jean Lennox (played by Vera Miles), who was Hannon's fianc&eacute; in America before he broke it off after losing his sight, shows up and insists on helping, too.This trio of amateurs quickly finds themselves deep in a deadly plot that will include murder, kidnapping and a ruthless Mr. Big. Phillip Hannon is smart, intuitive and persistent. But being blind, he has to tap his way through foggy London streets, sometimes at the mercy of those who would do him in. He must depend on Bob and Jean. Played by Van Johnson, he also is a most likeable hero. The incomparable Cecil Parker, with his fusty voice and only slightly dithering manner, makes Bob Mathews a loyal employee, brave when needed, and now convinced his boss is right. Cecil Parker was better at upper-class British double takes than anyone. Here, he shows he's the master of the extended sneeze. Vera Miles hasn't much to do but be pretty, loyal and in love. She does this very well.The movie hasn't dated much at all. The director, Henry Hathaway, keeps the action and the mystery percolating nicely. Several set pieces are fine - in a foggy street, in a ruined building without a faade, in the pub, in Hannon's darkened apartment where he comes face to face with Mr. Big. The movie was filmed in London and gains a lot from the settings and atmosphere.

Jones ""Howard Jones""","[0, 0]","This thriller set in London of the 1950s has more than a little touch of Hitchcock about it, though the direction here is by Henry Hathaway. Philip Hannon (Van Johnson) is an American playwright who is in London supervising production of one of his plays. He has the services of Bob Matthews (Cecil Parker) as valet. When visiting his local pub one evening he overhears a conversation that he thinks has sinister implications. He goes back to his flat and dictates the conversation word-for-word as well as he can remember it. Then an old and dear friend from America, Jean Lennox (Vera Miles), comes to call. He tries to convince Lennox and Matthews that the conversation should be investigated and he calls in the police, led by Inspector Grovening (Maurice Denham). The problem is that this remembered conversation is all there is to go: Hannon can give no description of the people involved as he is blind. As Hannon is a dramatist the police are sceptical so Hannon and his companions investigate on their own. The twists and turns in the story are plausible and intriguing and the characters are well drawn. There are no car chases or the sort of action stunts we see today (the film was made in 1956) but this film is well worth watching.",4,A thriller in the Hitchcock mould,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,1245,"['thriller', 'set', 'London', '1950s', 'more', 'little', 'touch', 'Hitchcock', 'direction', 'here', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'Philip', 'Hannon', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'American', 'playwright', 'who', 'London', 'supervising', 'production', 'one', 'plays', 'services', 'Bob', 'Matthews', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'valet', 'When', 'visiting', 'local', 'pub', 'one', 'evening', 'conversation', 'sinister', 'implications', 'back', 'flat', 'conversation', 'word-for-word', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'remember', 'Then', 'old', 'dear', 'friend', 'America', 'Jean', 'Lennox', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'call', 'convince', 'Lennox', 'Matthews', 'conversation', 'should', 'be', 'investigated', 'police', 'led', 'Inspector', 'Grovening', 'Maurice', 'Denham', 'problem', 'remembered', 'conversation', 'go', 'Hannon', 'can', 'give', 'description', 'people', 'involved', 'blind', 'Hannon', 'dramatist', 'police', 'are', 'sceptical', 'Hannon', 'companions', 'investigate', 'own', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'are', 'plausible', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'are', 'car', 'sort', 'action', 'stunts', 'see', 'today', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1956', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1333299,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0038VEXUQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[13, 15]","23 PACES TO BAKER STREET (1956) is a tour-de-force for both director Henry Hathaway and star Van Johnson. (Not forgetting the original novel by great prolific writer Philip MacDonald.) This is what I like to call ""near-noir"", and pretty darned good for all that. It was ignored, I think, because it came out the same year as Ford's THE SEARCHERS.Philip Hannon (Johnson) is a blind WWII vet living in London. As a writer, he lives well but he is angry and bitter about losing his sight in the war. Just for those characteristics alone he speaks to every generation, but he shows a fierce independence and pluck that goes beyond all that. He has learned not to let anyone else know he's blind. All he needs is a regular walking stick, which he uses for echolocation. He has the ears of a dog and Einstein's brain.In fact he was somewhat inspired by real-life 19th century traveler Lieutenant James Holman of the Royal Navy, known as the ""Blind Traveller"". Holman's bio, A SENSE OF THE WORLD (vid. my review) always reminds me of 23 PACES TO BAKER STREET, and vice-versa. The title refers to Hannon's knowledge of London; he helps a stranger who has lost his glasses, stops at a certain street and tells the man, ""From here it's exactly 23 paces to Baker Street."" The man never suspects Hannon can't see.His intrepid and extremely humorous butler, Bob (Cecil Parker) is a perfect complement to Hannon - and here I see the genesis of all television detectives. Hannon must also balance his relationship with semi-girlfriend Jean (Vera Miles). A revelatory scene shows just what blindness means when Jean inadvertently shuts a balcony door. When Hannon gets upset and runs right into it, he screams horribly about people changing things in his environment.Jean will have a LOT to learn if she really loves Hannon, which she does.One day Hannon overhears a kidnapping plot at his favorite restaurant (owned by the delightful and slightly wonky-looking Immortal, Estelle Winwood). Ultimately, in a true ""Ironside"" moment, Hannon lures the kidnapper-murderer to the apartment, which is pitch dark. This means nothing to Hannon - darkness is his ally - and with his dozens of dictaphones he frightens the murderer into submission.This is why I believe 23 PACES inspired the Japanese film series ZATOICHI, the blind masseur who often traps his enemies in the dark, and says, ""Darkness is my friend.""You will love 23 PACES, guaranteed, and wonder why this beautiful, evenly-paced film was such a sleeper. It'll astonish you how inspired it really is. I always say this is Van Johnson's 2nd greatest performance of his career, with his greatest being that of the reporter in STATE OF THE UNION.",5,23 PACES TO BAKER STREET but only one pace from great film,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2682,"['23', 'PACES', 'TO', 'BAKER', 'STREET', '1956', 'tour-de-force', 'director', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'star', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Not', 'forgetting', 'original', 'novel', 'great', 'prolific', 'writer', 'Philip', 'MacDonald', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'near-noir', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'was', 'ignored', 'think', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'Ford', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS.Philip', 'Hannon', 'Johnson', 'blind', 'WWII', 'vet', 'living', 'London', 'writer', 'well', 'angry', 'bitter', 'losing', 'sight', 'war', 'Just', 'characteristics', 'alone', 'generation', 'fierce', 'independence', 'pluck', 'learned', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'know', 'blind', 'regular', 'walking', 'stick', 'echolocation', 'ears', 'dog', 'Einstein', 'brain.In', 'fact', 'was', 'somewhat', 'inspired', 'real-life', '19th', 'century', 'traveler', 'Lieutenant', 'James', 'Holman', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'known', 'Blind', 'Traveller', 'Holman', 'bio', 'A', 'SENSE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'vid', 'review', 'always', '23', 'PACES', 'TO', 'BAKER', 'STREET', 'vice-versa', 'title', 'refers', 'Hannon', 'knowledge', 'London', 'stranger', 'who', 'lost', 'glasses', 'stops', 'certain', 'street', 'man', 'here', 'exactly', '23', 'paces', 'Baker', 'Street', 'man', 'never', 'Hannon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see.His', 'intrepid', 'extremely', 'humorous', 'butler', 'Bob', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'perfect', 'complement', 'Hannon', 'here', 'see', 'genesis', 'television', 'detectives', 'Hannon', 'must', 'also', 'balance', 'relationship', 'semi-girlfriend', 'Jean', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'revelatory', 'scene', 'just', 'what', 'blindness', 'when', 'Jean', 'inadvertently', 'balcony', 'door', 'When', 'Hannon', 'upset', 'runs', 'right', 'horribly', 'people', 'changing', 'things', 'environment.Jean', 'will', 'have', 'LOT', 'learn', 'really', 'Hannon', 'does.One', 'day', 'Hannon', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'delightful', 'slightly', 'wonky-looking', 'Immortal', 'Estelle', 'Winwood', 'Ultimately', 'true', 'Ironside', 'moment', 'Hannon', 'kidnapper-murderer', 'apartment', 'pitch', 'dark', 'nothing', 'Hannon', 'darkness', 'ally', 'dozens', 'dictaphones', 'murderer', 'submission.This', 'why', 'believe', '23', 'PACES', 'inspired', 'Japanese', 'film', 'series', 'ZATOICHI', 'blind', 'masseur', 'who', 'often', 'enemies', 'dark', 'Darkness', 'friend', 'will', 'love', '23', 'PACES', 'guaranteed', 'wonder', 'why', 'beautiful', 'evenly-paced', 'film', 'was', 'sleeper', ""'ll"", 'astonish', 'how', 'inspired', 'really', 'always', 'say', 'Van', 'Johnson', '2nd', 'greatest', 'performance', 'career', 'greatest', 'being', 'reporter', 'STATE', 'THE', 'UNION']",N/A

1333301,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0038VEXUQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","23 PACES TO BAKER STREET, an intriguing 1956 mystery flick, finds Van Johnson in unfamiliar territory, taking on a role which calls for him to be surly and embittered. Except that, actually, this role clings closer to his true personality. In real life, Van Johnson didn't exude the sunny, gregarious demeanor that his screen persona dictated.23 PACES TO BAKER STREET is based on Phillip MacDonald's novel WARRANT FOR X (which in 1938 had already been adapted into a British film titled THE NURSEMAID WHO DISAPPEARED). The central figure is recently disabled and pretty miffed about it. Blind New York playwright Phil Hannon (Van Johnson) has relocated to London and currently rides the wave of his latest play's popularity. Not that that's got anything to do with the plot. Instead, Phil Hannon, on his lonesome, is frequenting his favorite haunt, a pub two blocks away from his quarters, and overhears what may possibly be two people arranging a kidnapping. Gifted with terrific recall, Hannon dictates the overheard conversation verbatim on his clunky reel-to-reel tape recorder.I saw this movie premiering on TCM, a classic cinema network currently showcasing films that feature characters with disabilities. And one thing that viewing these films hammers home is that it's sure easier to dismiss someone with a disability. When the police proceed to pooh-pooh his suspicions, the frustrated playwright turns amateur detective, dragging along his visiting ex-girlfriend (Vera Miles) and his long-suffering butler (Cecil Parker, fantastic) on a desperate race to foil a gang of crooks and avert a child's abduction.Granted, there are slow spots in this film which I think you should indulge. Because 23 PACES TO BAKER STREET, ultimately, is a really good bit of cinema, worth watching alone just to see Van Johnson play against type. Watching Van Johnson boiling over and biting the hand what feeds him is sort of like catching a peek of Normal Rockwell kicking a dog. Johnson must've found serious commonality with his role, having suffered his own debilitating setback when a horrible car crash in 1943 left him with conspicuous facial scars.I like the Hitchcockian vibe director Henry Hathaway infuses onscreen. I love how the plot unfolds to spotlight how Hannon compensates for his disability by applying his remaining functioning senses to make headway in his sleuthing. But the plot also delivers nerve-jangling moments in which his blindness lands him in sticky dilemmas. Vera Miles is stalwart as the patient ex-girlfriend. But keep an eye out for superb supporting performances from Cecil Parker as Hannon's terribly inconvenienced butler and Estelle Winwood's helpful Cockney barmaid. Unfortunately, the villains tend to linger in the shadows, so we're deprived of a truly memorable big bad. October is officially Sightless Protagonists Cinema month.

He goes to the police but they cannot do much to prevent the crime without more information. He gets the assistance of an old girlfriend (Vera Miles) and the butler, tracks down the suspects and solves the crime..........I liked the movie but found Van Johnson's acting to be very annoying. He plays a headstrong theatre writer who can't accept the fact that he has some limitations because he is blind. Result is that he gets into trouble and others have to bail him out....story was good if you can overlook his portrayal of the writer.....for me it ruined a good picture.",3,"A ""Who done it"" set in London",1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,735,"['Overall', 'good', 'story', 'blind', 'man', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'who', 'thinks', 'murder', 'kidnapping', 'take', 'place', 'conversation', 'pub', 'police', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'prevent', 'crime', 'more', 'information', 'assistance', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'butler', 'down', 'suspects', 'crime', '.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'found', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'acting', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'headstrong', 'theatre', 'writer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'fact', 'limitations', 'blind', 'Result', 'trouble', 'others', 'have', 'bail', 'out', '.story', 'was', 'good', 'can', 'overlook', 'portrayal', 'writer', 'ruined', 'good', 'picture']",N/A
