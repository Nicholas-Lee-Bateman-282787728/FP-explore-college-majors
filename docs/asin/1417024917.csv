172229,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,1417024917,Alex Udvary,"[4, 8]","Woody Allen, in my opinion, is the most influential comedy director since Charlie Chaplin. In complete contradiction to the American public I've enjoyed Allen's recent films. I've openly welcomed such titles as ""Small Time Crooks"", ""Hollywood Ending"", and ""Melinda and Melinda"". And I was terribly please at the reaction ""Match Point"" was getting from the critics and the public alike.But, to my dismay, Allen's lastest film, ""Scoop"" isn't very good. As I've said, I'm not one of these people who criticize Woody Allen's every picture, but, there are problems with this film.The story revolves around a young American journalist, Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) visiting London, for an assignment on her college paper. While in London she attends a magic show where she is pulled from the audience to assist the magician (Allen of course!) in a disappearing act. While inside the disappearing box Sondra has an encounter with a spirit. A recently deceased journalist, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has found a way to make contact with the living and has given Sondra the ""scoop of the century"".Recently a serial killer nicknamed ""the tarot card killer"" has been strangling brunette prostitutes (apparently blondes do have more fun!). Now with this information Sondra decides to get Sid Waterman, the magician, to help her capture the killer. Her main suspect is Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Peter comes from a British version of the Kennedy family, with deep roots in politics.The story admittedly sounds funny. And it recalls Allen's own ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"". But the screenplay isn't as sharp. It's clear what Allen is aiming for. A kind of old-fashion whodunnit comedy\mystery a la ""The Thin Man"". But Allen and Johansson do not have much chemistry between them. Nor do Jackman and Johansson.Chemistry though is not this film's main problem. The character played by Allen isn't very well delevopled, which is a surprise because Allen usually gives himself the best part. His character keeps switching on whether or not he believes Lyman is the killer or not. In one scene he's telling Sondra she's crazy for thinking it could be Lyman and in the next he's telling her she's crazy for NOT thinking it.Another problem with the Allen character is Allen himself. He's trying way too hard to be funny. It's as if he's forcing us to laugh at him. Allen's performance is too ""in your face"". He's basically playing the same character he played in ""Broadway Danny Rose"", though without that character's charm. Danny Rose was a lovable loser. Sid Waterman is just a loser.And finally ""Scoop"" committs the biggest offense a comedy can committ. I would have been able to cope with Allen's loud performance or the lack of chemistry, but, ""Scoop""'s biggest problem is the lack of laughs. Many of the jokes fell flat for me. This is unheard of coming from me! I'm probably the last true Woody Allen fan on the planet. Or at least the last one in this country. But the movie doesn't have any memorable lines. Nothing my friends and I can quote to one another. There were lines in Allen's previous comedies that we could do that with.Though it's not all bad news for ""Scoop"". Once again, in complete contradiction to the American public, I've actually missed not seeing Allen on screen. The last time was three years ago in ""Anything Else"". As with that film, Allen has once again made himself the co-star. I like seeing Allen on-screen. That was a welcome treat, now if only the performance would have been more worthwhile.Plus, the musical score is pleasant. Allen seems to think that just because he's shooting his films in London he can no longer use his familiar jazz songs. That's not true. Does he think that American music is too vulgar for his new setting? The music in this film, as was the case with ""Match Point"" is classical. Tchaikovsky, Strauss and selections from Grieg's ""Peer Gynt"" are heard on the soundtrack.The funny thing about the musical choices is, if American music is too vulgar, look at the way Allen displays the two American characters in the film. They are loud and uncultured. What's Allen saying there?""Scoop"" does hint at some serious topics underneath its ""light"" appearance, as do most of Allen's ""trivial comedies"". Here is a movie that tells us danger lurks everywhere. And just because things or people seem to be perfect, scandal is always close behind.The movie's best scene in my opinion is the last one. It is pure Woody Allen in the best sense of the phrase. Now if only the rest of the movie could have been as funny. ** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Allen is back with a pure comedy though the results are not as satisfying as I would have hoped. Weak character development, lack of chemistry, and flat jokes stop this from being an enjoyable Woody Allen film.",2,"""Scoop"" Doesn't Make Headlines!",1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,4797,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'opinion', 'most', 'influential', 'comedy', 'director', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'complete', 'contradiction', 'American', 'public', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Allen', 'recent', 'films', ""'ve"", 'openly', 'welcomed', 'such', 'titles', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'was', 'terribly', 'please', 'reaction', 'Match', 'Point', 'was', 'getting', 'critics', 'public', 'alike.But', 'dismay', 'Allen', 'lastest', 'film', 'Scoop', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'criticize', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'picture', 'are', 'problems', 'film.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'young', 'American', 'journalist', 'Sondra', 'Pransky', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'visiting', 'London', 'assignment', 'college', 'paper', 'London', 'magic', 'show', 'where', 'pulled', 'audience', 'assist', 'magician', 'Allen', 'course', 'disappearing', 'act', 'disappearing', 'box', 'Sondra', 'encounter', 'spirit', 'recently', 'deceased', 'journalist', 'Joe', 'Strombel', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'contact', 'living', 'given', 'Sondra', 'scoop', 'century', '.Recently', 'serial', 'killer', 'nicknamed', 'tarot', 'card', 'killer', 'been', 'strangling', 'brunette', 'prostitutes', 'apparently', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'Now', 'information', 'Sondra', 'get', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'magician', 'help', 'capture', 'killer', 'main', 'suspect', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Peter', 'British', 'version', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'deep', 'roots', 'politics.The', 'story', 'admittedly', 'funny', 'Allen', 'own', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'as', 'sharp', 'clear', 'what', 'Allen', 'aiming', 'kind', 'old-fashion', 'whodunnit', 'comedy\\mystery', 'la', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Allen', 'Johansson', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'do', 'Jackman', 'Johansson.Chemistry', 'though', 'not', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'character', 'played', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'delevopled', 'surprise', 'Allen', 'usually', 'best', 'part', 'character', 'switching', 'not', 'Lyman', 'killer', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'telling', 'Sondra', 'crazy', 'thinking', 'could', 'be', 'Lyman', 'next', 'telling', 'crazy', 'NOT', 'thinking', 'problem', 'Allen', 'character', 'Allen', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'forcing', 'laugh', 'Allen', 'performance', 'too', 'face', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'played', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'character', 'charm', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'was', 'lovable', 'loser', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'just', 'loser.And', 'finally', 'Scoop', 'biggest', 'offense', 'comedy', 'can', 'committ', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'cope', 'Allen', 'loud', 'performance', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Scoop', 'biggest', 'problem', 'lack', 'laughs', 'Many', 'jokes', 'fell', 'flat', 'unheard', 'coming', ""'m"", 'probably', 'last', 'true', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'planet', 'least', 'last', 'one', 'country', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'memorable', 'lines', 'Nothing', 'friends', 'can', 'quote', 'one', 'were', 'lines', 'Allen', 'previous', 'comedies', 'could', 'do', 'not', 'bad', 'news', 'Scoop', 'Once', 'again', 'complete', 'contradiction', 'American', 'public', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'missed', 'not', 'seeing', 'Allen', 'screen', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'Anything', 'Else', 'film', 'Allen', 'once', 'again', 'made', 'co-star', 'seeing', 'Allen', 'on-screen', 'was', 'welcome', 'treat', 'now', 'only', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'worthwhile.Plus', 'musical', 'score', 'pleasant', 'Allen', 'think', 'just', 'shooting', 'films', 'London', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'familiar', 'jazz', 'songs', 'not', 'true', 'think', 'American', 'music', 'too', 'vulgar', 'new', 'setting', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'case', 'Match', 'Point', 'classical', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Strauss', 'selections', 'Grieg', 'Peer', 'Gynt', 'are', 'heard', 'soundtrack.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'musical', 'choices', 'American', 'music', 'too', 'vulgar', 'look', 'way', 'Allen', 'two', 'American', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'loud', 'uncultured', 'What', 'Allen', 'saying', 'there', 'Scoop', 'hint', 'serious', 'topics', 'light', 'appearance', 'do', 'most', 'Allen', 'trivial', 'comedies', 'Here', 'movie', 'danger', 'lurks', 'everywhere', 'just', 'things', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'scandal', 'always', 'close', 'behind.The', 'movie', 'best', 'scene', 'opinion', 'last', 'one', 'pure', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'sense', 'phrase', 'Now', 'only', 'rest', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', '**', '1\\2', '*****Bottom-line', 'Allen', 'back', 'pure', 'comedy', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Weak', 'character', 'development', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'flat', 'jokes', 'stop', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film']",N/A

172233,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1417024917,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I will attest to the fact that I did not expect anything more than a passing good time walking into `Scoop', although I was hoping for more.  I got what I expected and so for that I am thankful.  Regardless of the bad reviews it received upon it's release, `Scoop' has a lot going for it (not the least of which is Johansson's comedic timing) and while it does not stack up to Allen's previous `Match Point' (how anyone can say that `Match Point' is overrated is beyond me when it's lack of a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars proves it is nothing short of underrated) it offers the audience a fun and quirky good time.The film follows young aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky who winds up getting the tip of a lifetime from the deceased reporter Joe Strombel while attending a magic show starring the Great Splendini (also known as Sid Waterman).  The dead Strombel proceeds to tell Pransky that a young politician named Peter Lyman may in fact be the feared tarot card serial killer.  This proves to be the big break that Pransky was waiting for, and so with Waterman in toe she proceeds to infiltrate Lyman's life in order to uncover the truth, a truth that becomes more and more difficult for her to see once her infatuation for Lyman starts to blind her better judgment.`Scoop' suffers in one key area, and that is plot.  In the end the film feels incomplete, like half a movie.  You leave feeling as if Woody forgot a big chuck of the film on the cutting room floor.  The script work, dialog wise, for the most part is pretty strong, but the plot holes ware on the viewer as the film draws to a close.What it lacks in plot development it makes up for in the sublime casting choices.  Hugh Jackman is superb as Peter Lyman.  He is charming and debonair and extremely handsome (maybe more so than he's ever been since I've never thought him attractive, but he pulls it off here).  His portrayal of Lyman is spot on, making it easy to see why Pransky is falling so hard for him.  Better still is the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Sondra.  Johnasson is proving one film at a time that she has the chops to handle a film all her own, and here she expands her talent to cover comedy as well.  Her bantering with Woody is flawless, and she matches his wit step for step, frame for frame; in fact she out-wits him many times, handling her dialog with crisper, funnier delivery.  Woody Allen works most of the time, but as the film continues onward his character borders on annoying (that whole ""I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I love you, you're a beautiful person"" bit gets old fast).While Ian McShane does not give a bad performance, I will say that his character is the biggest plot hole.  A film that hinges on a tip given by a ghost you would think would make that ghost seem important or vital but in the end his character is very throwaway and could have ultimately been left out.Woody needs to work on that.In then end I will say that `Scoop' met my expectations.  It did not exceed them, but then again not every movie needs to do that.  Scarlett is a revelation as Sondra, funny and witty and charming and she proves that she does not need to rely on her sensuality to sell a film for she tones herself down drastically and plays Pronsky with just as much ease and comfort as she did Nola Rice.  The dialog is sharp (for the most part) and the pacing is brisk, it just suffers from being too light in the end, losing some of its depth in the holes throughout the plot.If you want a satisfying comedy than `Scoop' may just do the trick, but if you want a more intelligent and tightly woven film then look at Allen's previous effort `Match Point' (or even the tragically under seen `Melinda and Melinda').",3,It's like half a movie...,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,3727,"['will', 'attest', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'passing', 'good', 'time', 'walking', 'Scoop', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'so', 'am', 'thankful', 'Regardless', 'bad', 'received', 'release', 'Scoop', 'lot', 'going', 'not', 'least', 'Johansson', 'comedic', 'timing', 'not', 'stack', 'up', 'Allen', 'previous', 'Match', 'Point', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'say', 'Match', 'Point', 'overrated', 'when', 'lack', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'Oscars', 'nothing', 'short', 'underrated', 'audience', 'fun', 'quirky', 'good', 'time.The', 'film', 'young', 'aspiring', 'journalist', 'Sondra', 'Pransky', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'tip', 'lifetime', 'deceased', 'reporter', 'Joe', 'Strombel', 'attending', 'magic', 'show', 'starring', 'Great', 'Splendini', 'also', 'known', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'dead', 'Strombel', 'proceeds', 'tell', 'Pransky', 'young', 'politician', 'named', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'feared', 'tarot', 'card', 'serial', 'killer', 'be', 'big', 'break', 'Pransky', 'was', 'waiting', 'so', 'Waterman', 'toe', 'infiltrate', 'Lyman', 'life', 'order', 'uncover', 'truth', 'truth', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'see', 'once', 'infatuation', 'Lyman', 'blind', 'better', 'judgment.', 'Scoop', 'suffers', 'one', 'key', 'area', 'plot', 'end', 'film', 'feels', 'incomplete', 'movie', 'leave', 'feeling', 'Woody', 'forgot', 'big', 'chuck', 'film', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'script', 'work', 'dialog', 'wise', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'strong', 'plot', 'holes', 'ware', 'viewer', 'film', 'close.What', 'plot', 'development', 'up', 'sublime', 'casting', 'choices', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'superb', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'charming', 'debonair', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'ever', 'been', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'attractive', 'off', 'here', 'portrayal', 'Lyman', 'spot', 'making', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Pransky', 'falling', 'so', 'hard', 'Better', 'still', 'casting', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Sondra', 'Johnasson', 'proving', 'one', 'film', 'time', 'chops', 'handle', 'film', 'own', 'here', 'talent', 'cover', 'comedy', 'well', 'bantering', 'Woody', 'flawless', 'wit', 'step', 'step', 'frame', 'frame', 'fact', 'many', 'times', 'handling', 'dialog', 'crisper', 'funnier', 'delivery', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'time', 'film', 'character', 'borders', 'annoying', 'whole', 'mean', 'bottom', 'heart', 'love', ""'re"", 'beautiful', 'person', 'bit', 'old', 'fast', '.While', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'not', 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'will', 'say', 'character', 'biggest', 'plot', 'hole', 'film', 'tip', 'given', 'ghost', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'ghost', 'seem', 'important', 'vital', 'end', 'character', 'very', 'throwaway', 'could', 'have', 'ultimately', 'been', 'left', 'out.Woody', 'work', 'that.In', 'then', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'Scoop', 'met', 'expectations', 'did', 'not', 'exceed', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'movie', 'do', 'Scarlett', 'revelation', 'Sondra', 'funny', 'witty', 'charming', 'not', 'need', 'rely', 'sensuality', 'sell', 'film', 'down', 'drastically', 'Pronsky', 'just', 'much', 'ease', 'comfort', 'did', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'most', 'part', 'pacing', 'brisk', 'just', 'suffers', 'being', 'too', 'light', 'end', 'losing', 'depth', 'holes', 'plot.If', 'want', 'satisfying', 'comedy', 'Scoop', 'may', 'just', 'do', 'trick', 'want', 'more', 'intelligent', 'tightly', 'woven', 'film', 'then', 'look', 'Allen', 'previous', 'effort', 'Match', 'Point', 'even', 'tragically', 'seen', 'Melinda', 'Melinda']",N/A
172234,ABSX5TGEGRH76,1417024917,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[16, 21]","I am by no means a Woody Allen buff.  The only movies of his, besides this one, that I've seen are Small Time Crooks and Match Point, so I don't know what he was like when he was at the top of his game.  Small Time Crooks was awful, but Match Point was amazing, and many critics hailed it as Allen's return to form.  When I learned that he was doing another movie with Scarlett Johanson (who I will see in almost anything), I was very excited.  Despite mediocre reviews, my interest didn't wane too much.  In brief, I enjoyed the movie a lot and found it fun and entertaining.  It is not going to win any Oscars, nor is it as good as the brilliant Match Point, but it's a good way to spend and hour and a half.Sondra Pransky (Johanson) is a geeky journalism student vacationing in London.  Coming from a family of dentists and dental hygenists, she is trying to break out of the life she was born into by pursuing a more adventurous career.  She is awkward, speaks quickly, and has a tendancy to speak too close to people.  While attending a magic show performed by another American living in London, Sid ""Splendini"" Waterman (Allen), she is confronted by the ghost of a recently deceased reporter named Joe Strombel (Ian McShane).  While being escorted by Death across the River Styx (yes, they actually show this scene, which was subtly funny), he received a tip that a prominent English citizen may in fact be a serial killer known for leaving tarot cards beside his victims.  Sondra asks Sid to help her out in order to find what could be the biggest scoop of the decade.Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) is the object of Sondra and Sid's investigation.  He is the wealthy son of an English lord, and will no doubt enter politics within a few years.  Upon meeting Sondra, who introduces herself as Jade Spence (and refers to Sid as her father), he is immediately smitten with the beautiful young woman.  He begins inviting her and Sid to attend parties in the countryside as well begins putting the moves on her.  The pair use the opportunities to further investigate Lyman.  Though as the events of the story unfold, Sondra finds herself falling for Peter, while Sid, who begins the film as the skeptic, becomes convinced that despite only circumstantial evidence, Peter is the killer.Jackman definitely does the best in the film.  He perfectly plays Lyman as a charming man who may or may not be hiding a few secrets.  Johansson is always good, but she seems a little unsure of how to play such an awkward character.  At the beginning of the film, she is a little over the top, but as the movie goes on, she begins to get a better feel for her character (side note: she looks so awesome in her glasses!).  McShane basically has only a cameo role, but he does a good job with it.  As for Allen, half the time he is hilarious, the other half the time he is just annoying.  His quirks are funny the first couple times, but each of his gags are done to death.  His constant recitation of how much he loves people when he meets them is really only funny the first two times and the last time (due to the circumstances).  It's amazing that Sondra stuck around with him so long or even invited him to join her in the first place, seeing as how she often talked about how much he annoyed her.  These four parts were really the only four roles with any substance, though I must mention that I was very happy to see Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) show up in a cameo role as a cop.This film is definitely for people who are fans of the performers involved.  Allen fans will probably like it (though some may complain about a few similarities to Match Point).  People smitten with Johansson need no excuse to go see this, and Jackman and McShane are also worthy of attention.

Scoop is not the worst of his latter day movies, but assuredly it is one that will not stand tall among his other productions. At first I hoped it was based on Evelyn Waugh's book of the same title but I soon discovered that it bore no relation to that masterful work. The performances here are acceptable, but the plot itself is weak and features a rather goofy ending (in my view). Hugh Jackman's bad guy was a bit of a stretch, but that's nothing in comparison to Allen's casting of Scarlett Johansson as a mousy college reporter. In no way is she believable in that role. Of course, this is not her fault; it's the director's. Why Woody Allen continues to take the most sought after actors of our day and turn them into androgynous versions of himself for 90 minutes is beyond my reckoning. I've seen it happen many times in the past and he should really allow his characters to drop their neuroses and become people independent of the auteur. Furthermore, Allen's Sid Waterman is a dicey endeavor. He plays Johansson's supposed dad although granddad would be more appropriate. The film would have been better without his character and the jokes he made fell flat. I found his portrayal of England's social structure to be about five decades behind the times.

The magic trick goes awry and brings back the spirit of a recently deceased, well-known journalist (played by the great Ian McShane of Deadwood fame) with ""the scoop of the century.""  The thing is, he discovers the scoop, involving a serial killer (the tarot card killer), on his way to the hereafter directly from one of the killer's victims and not being able to break the story himself, manages to get messages to Sondra through the magical talents of Splendini.  It turns out that this particular victim was poisoned because she was about to blow the whistle on the killer who just happened to be the son of a British Lord.  The son is Peter Lyman, played by Hugh Jackman.  I won't say anything more about the story because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't already seen it.  There are some interesting twists as Scarlett and Woody try to break the story as a faux father/daughter combo.That said, I thought the casting was so good because it went against stereotypes: Hugh Jackman as a bad guy (yes, one CAN be handsome AND evil all at the same time) and Scarlett Johansson as a nerdier version of herself.  Woody was classic Woody (but you just don't mess with that).  I felt that this film showed Woody evolving.  Perhaps some people were disappointed because they are accustomed to Woody a certain way - the old way - when Diane Keaton was a regular in his films.  But you have to give the guy credit for stepping out of the box and asking his actors to do the same.  I think some people might have been disappointed too with Scarlett in a not so glamorous role but I found that I liked her better because of it.  People get too comfortable with directors/actors/writers doing similar projects over and over that they end up feeling let down if the director/actor/writer does something new or different.  Change is good though.This is a perfect movie to see if you feel like laughing until you hurt.  When I saw it in the theatre, the noise level (laughing) got so loud that it was, at times, difficult to hear some of the dialogue.

172243,A18G7GG53G2X8A,1417024917,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","Woody Allen is no dummy when it comes to filmmaking; he knows the story he wants to tell and he understands the value of casting the right person in the right part. And his writing style is unique to say the least, combining humor, drama, and philosophical observations (listening to him ramble is akin to reading the psychoanalytic writings of Jacques Lacan). None of these elements are lost in ""Scoop,"" his second film to star Scarlett Johansson and to be filmed in London. However, the fact that all the elements are there is also part of the problem. Yes, ""Scoop"" is funny, analytic, mysterious, and even supernatural (which seems to be a popular plot device in a lot of Allen's movies). But it's also a long-winded and pretentious film, almost as if it were made solely for the director's enjoyment.It's difficult for me to say that because Allen has made a number of well crafted films, including ""Love and Death"" and last year's ""Match Point."" But I sometimes wonder if his capacity for quality entertainment always has to include such a mishmash of different storytelling methods. ""Scoop"" mixes several genres that don't ordinarily get mixed, and the result was a pretty confused film about romance, mystery, and murder. Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, an American college student who hopes to become a full time journalist. While staying with a family friend in London, she attends a magic show hosted by Sid Waterman, known on stage as Splendini (Woody Allen). She's asked to volunteer on stage by stepping into a large box (which will supposedly make her disappear).Upon entering the box, the ghost of former newspaper reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) materializes. Here enters the supernatural side of the story: he's gotten a major scoop from beyond the grave, and rather than let it go, he decides that a living reporter should investigate. He has reason to believe that England's most notorious serial killer since Jack the Ripper--the Tarot Card Killer--may actually be Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), a well known member of the British upper class. Unfortunately, Strombel has no way to prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt. He can only rely on Sondra, a young woman who he feels has what it takes to get to the bottom of things.After this encounter, she and Sid form a dysfunctional partnership by posing as father and daughter. Here enters the comedic side of the story: they go through a series of circumstances that exploit their friendly yet problematic relationship. Yes, the fact that they're completely mismatched makes for some humorous moments. Allen is known for playing the neurotic New Yorker, and for ""Scoop"" he lays that personality on thick. Johansson plays an overly ambitious journalist, one whose pluckiness leaves her unable to understand why certain words come out of Sid's mouth. The two couldn't be anything less alike, and in that sense, their interactions work. But I still wanted something more, something that wasn't overshadowed by immature bickering. After a while, it became exhausting to listen to. Maybe it would have been better if Allen hadn't actually been in the film; his comedic persona didn't mesh with the story he was trying to tell.By the time Sondra and Lyman actually meet, Sid seems even more out of place than he already was. For a man posing as a friend to the British elite, he can't seem to get out of the magician mode of thinking; he always performs an effective yet socially unacceptable card trick whenever he's with a large group of people. He uses his on-stage routines to help him get through a conversation, rambling on and on about how each person is terrific, lovely, and a credit to his or her race (he also says, ""And I say that with all due respect,"" quite often, even when he's insulting someone). It's all undeniably Woody Allen material, which is funny some of the time, inappropriate at others. I won't go so far as to say that his humor completely stalls the film, but it does make it more difficult to get into the story.That's a shame because the more interesting moments occur from the middle of the film onward. Lyman takes an immediate liking to this young American girl (who he believes is named Jade), and the whirlwind romance inevitably begins. But while Sondra knows that her feelings can't get in the way of her story, she's gradually finding it more and more difficult to believe Lyman is the Tarot Card Killer. This is in spite of the fact that the murders are continuing, the timings of which coincide with his mysterious absences. However, Sondra doesn't completely give in; she and Sid do quite a bit of snooping as the film progresses, gathering plenty of clues that could expose Lyman as a murderer. The problem is that every shred of evidence they have is purely circumstantial. If they want to accuse a powerful and famous man of unspeakable crimes, they need to be absolutely sure of themselves.It eventually becomes a question of what to believe. Is Lyman really the Tarot Card Killer? Are Strombel's instincts about this case dead wrong (pun definitely intended)? Is the evidence Sondra collected going to be enough to convince the authorities? Does the evidence even lead to proof of guilt, or is it all just a series of coincidences? This is the one aspect of the film that actually worked for me; the mysterious elements are quite fascinating, especially since we're given the opportunity to solve the mystery along with Sondra and Sid. But I would have enjoyed this movie much more if it knew what it wanted to be. I think I would have preferred it be a straight murder mystery. Allen's esoteric humor didn't do much to enliven the story, nor did the supernatural elements.Then again, these are trademark components to a Woody Allen screenplay, and when you follow a formula for so long, change is difficult to accept. I suppose devoted fans will get their money's worth from ""Scoop,"" but I shouldn't think anyone else would. It's simply not one of his better movies.

Middleton,"[3, 4]","It is certainly hard to believe that Woody Allen has been creating films for over a generation - the mind boggles at the extent of his entire body of work. There isn't a filmmaker out there one could say has hit the mark every time, and Allen isn't an exception. His last serious film, Match Point, had mixed reviews as most of Allen's non-comedic films do, however the dialogue was truly excellent and the ending quite ruthless. In a word, one of his latest projects, Scoop, is a gem. The jokes are non-stop which had my friend and I (who isn't an Allen fan) laughing out loud from beginning to end.It has been said and written many times before that you are either a Woody Allen fan or not...this may be true, though Scoop could just well make a few converts because the film is light, very funny with an entertaining plot, where one can sit back and have a good time without having to think too much.Scarlett Johansson does an excellent job as the 'student' reporter, called upon by a dead newsman to investigate one of London's most notorious serial killers, the ""Tarot Card Killer"". Scarlett revealed in this film that she is a good, if not great, comedic actor; between Allen and her, each scene gets better and better. Their exchange of lines runs fast (sometimes in staccato fashion) and you have to pay attention to catch the various subtlties - comedy is all about timing, and their timing was close to perfect.Hugh Jackman (Peter Lyman) as the English aristocrat, was played with charm, and the actor has shown his fans that he can play just about anything he puts his mind to - a great actor.The ending of the story tied it all up: surprising, funny with a subtle twist.Scoop is Woody Allen going back to basics - witty and hilarious.A firm five stars.",5,Back to Basics,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,1764,"['certainly', 'hard', 'believe', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'been', 'creating', 'films', 'generation', 'mind', 'boggles', 'extent', 'entire', 'body', 'work', ""n't"", 'filmmaker', 'there', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'hit', 'mark', 'time', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'exception', 'last', 'serious', 'film', 'Match', 'Point', 'had', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'most', 'Allen', 'non-comedic', 'films', 'do', 'however', 'dialogue', 'was', 'truly', 'excellent', 'ending', 'quite', 'ruthless', 'word', 'one', 'latest', 'projects', 'Scoop', 'gem', 'jokes', 'are', 'non-stop', 'had', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'Allen', 'fan', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'beginning', 'end.It', 'been', 'said', 'written', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'either', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Scoop', 'could', 'just', 'well', 'make', 'few', 'converts', 'film', 'light', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'having', 'think', 'too', 'much.Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'excellent', 'job', ""'student"", 'reporter', 'called', 'upon', 'dead', 'newsman', 'investigate', 'one', 'London', 'most', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killers', 'Tarot', 'Card', 'Killer', 'Scarlett', 'revealed', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Allen', 'scene', 'better', 'better', 'exchange', 'lines', 'runs', 'fast', 'sometimes', 'staccato', 'fashion', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'catch', 'various', 'subtlties', 'comedy', 'timing', 'timing', 'was', 'close', 'perfect.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'was', 'played', 'charm', 'actor', 'shown', 'fans', 'can', 'play', 'just', 'anything', 'mind', 'great', 'actor.The', 'ending', 'story', 'tied', 'up', 'surprising', 'funny', 'subtle', 'twist.Scoop', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'going', 'back', 'basics', 'witty', 'hilarious.A', 'firm', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

This tale- a bit over an hour and a half, uses several key themes in the Allen canon- sex, deceit, lies, murder, and magic, and also has much in common with 1993's underrated Manhattan Murder Mystery, his terrific 1984 film, Broadway Danny Rose- perhaps his best straight comedy, and some of 1989's Oedipus Wrecks- from the New York Stories trilogy film Allen did with Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a college student in England who is studying journalism. She is selected out of the audience by the Great Splendini (Allen), whose real name is Sid Waterman. What works well is that Johansson is a very good comedienne, and much more believable in this role than her role as the bitchy siren in Match Point. Unlike many other Woody persona stand-ins of the last twenty years, she handles his humor without aping the Woody persona (see John Cusack in Bullets Over Broadway, Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity, or Will Ferrell in Melinda And Melinda), and may be the best Allen comedienne after Diane Keaton.... So, when you read negative reviews of this film, which might compare it to some of his decidedly lighter weight comedies like Small Time Crooks (which was still funnier than a Wayans family film), do not believe it. Scoop is a good movie- a very good movie, and in her second pairing with Allen, Scarlett Johansson proves that while she may never be the sex symbol/screen siren type in the Angelina Jolie/Halle Berry/Catherine Zeta-Jones mold, she can do comedy the way none of them can. And, since few have ever done comedy equal to or better than Allen, I predict an Oscar for her in the very near future- and, for a change, she may be the rare starlet who'll deserve such kudos.As for Allen? Now with his Woody persona killed, one can only hope that the behind the scenes Allen will concentrate more on screenplays in the Match Point vein, and produce a few latter-day gems to bookend such Golden Era fare as Stardust Memories, Radio Days, and Crimes And Misdemeanors. And if Johansson is in a few, so much the better, for an Annie Hall for a younger generation could never be considered a bad thing.",4,Underrated,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,2291,"['Even', 'third', 'rate', 'Allen', 'few', 'notches', 'funnier', 'best', 'dreck', 'Hollywood', 'offers', 'Allen', 'films', 'get', 'better', 'successive', 'viewings', 'tale-', 'bit', 'hour', 'half', 'several', 'key', 'themes', 'Allen', 'canon-', 'sex', 'deceit', 'murder', 'magic', 'also', 'much', 'common', '1993', 'underrated', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'terrific', '1984', 'film', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose-', 'perhaps', 'best', 'straight', 'comedy', '1989', 'Oedipus', 'Wrecks-', 'New', 'York', 'Stories', 'trilogy', 'film', 'Allen', 'did', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Johansson', 'Sondra', 'Pransky', 'college', 'student', 'England', 'who', 'studying', 'journalism', 'selected', 'audience', 'Great', 'Splendini', 'Allen', 'real', 'name', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'What', 'well', 'Johansson', 'very', 'good', 'comedienne', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'role', 'role', 'bitchy', 'siren', 'Match', 'Point', 'many', 'other', 'Woody', 'persona', 'stand-ins', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'humor', 'aping', 'Woody', 'persona', 'see', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Bullets', 'Over', 'Broadway', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Celebrity', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Allen', 'comedienne', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'So', 'when', 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'might', 'compare', 'decidedly', 'lighter', 'weight', 'comedies', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'was', 'still', 'funnier', 'Wayans', 'family', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Scoop', 'good', 'movie-', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'second', 'pairing', 'Allen', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'sex', 'symbol/screen', 'siren', 'type', 'Angelina', 'Jolie/Halle', 'Berry/Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'mold', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'way', 'none', 'can', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'comedy', 'equal', 'better', 'Allen', 'predict', 'Oscar', 'very', 'future-', 'change', 'may', 'be', 'rare', 'starlet', 'who', ""'ll"", 'deserve', 'such', 'kudos.As', 'Allen', 'Now', 'Woody', 'persona', 'killed', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'scenes', 'Allen', 'will', 'concentrate', 'more', 'screenplays', 'Match', 'Point', 'vein', 'produce', 'few', 'latter-day', 'gems', 'bookend', 'such', 'Golden', 'Era', 'fare', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'Radio', 'Days', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Johansson', 'few', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'younger', 'generation', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

However, I happened to catch this movie when flipping around and watched the rest of it and then caught the whole film at a later viewing.  I liked it!  No, it isn't a great film, but it is a delightful light entertainment.Scarlett Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young, somewhat ditzy but earnest reporter for her college newspaper.  She is in London visiting a wealth upper crust friend and staying with her family.  We also learn that she has (as Woody Allen's character notes later) a problem with promiscuity.  For example, when trying to get an interview with a big time movie producer who has no intention of telling her anything, all she comes away with is a hangover and an embarrassing story of being outwitted.We also get to see a barge load of souls headed to the land of the departed engaging in the kind of idle conversation you might expect from the newly dead.  A secretary tells a reporter that she knows who the Tarot Card Killer is.  The reporter, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) asks her how she would know that.  She says that she noticed something about her boss's cufflinks and told someone about it over the phone, but she had hear a click on the line and suspected someone was listening.  She notes that she was dead by that afternoon and suspected poison.  Her boss is the millionaire son of a Lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) and Strombel is determined to not let such a story pass and slips off the barge to swim back towards the land of the living.While attending a magic show by ""The Great Splendini"", Sondra gets selected to enter the ""dematerializer"" so she will disappear and then reappear as her molecules are agitated.  While she is in the box, Strombel materializes and tells her that he knows she is a reporter and gives her the gist of the story before he is taken back.  Sondra is confused, but does a web search of the key elements, goes back to tell the rightly skeptical Splendini (Woody Allen) and wants to get back in his box.  Splendini lets her do it, but notes that he is really just Sid Waterman and he built the ""dematerializer"" and it is just plywood.  Nothing happens while she is in the box, but after she steps out Strombel appears in a way that she and Sid can see and hear.  Sid wants no part of it, but is drawn in.  Sondra is convinced of Lyman's guilt and Sid is equally convinced of his innocence.The rest of the story is how Sid and Sondra try to determine what is real and what is false about the story.  Strombel makes a couple more short appearances to help a bit, but Sondra is also falling for the handsome and sensitive Peter Lyman and no longer believes he is the bad guy while Sid has flipped to becoming convinced of his guild.Who is right, who is wrong, and how the story ends you should watch this charming little tale to find out.

Strombel manages a ghostly appearance in the middle of a magic act to American college student and aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), convincing her to pursue the scoop.

172252,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1417024917,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","This is very much minor-league Woody Allen, though it is not without its charms. Set in London the same as his previous film, ""Match Point"", this 2006 mystery comedy also shares the same upper crust ambiance and the same leading lady, the omnipresent Scarlett Johansson. However, the tone is thoroughly lightweight somewhat reminiscent of Allen's more entertaining ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" (1993), and Johansson is not an obsessive femme fatale this time but a jittery Diane Keaton doppelganger as college student and aspiring reporter Sondra Pransky. Attending a show in London with friends, Sondra gets chosen by Catskills-style magician Sid ""Splendini"" Waterman to participate in a magic trick where she disappears in a Chinese box. While in there, a ghost appears - Joe Strombel, a just-deceased journalist who has found out from a fellow spirit  that the ""Tarot Card Killer"" terrorizing young brunette women in London is likely a young old-money aristocrat named Peter Lyman.Strombel passes the information along to Sondra, who sees this exclusive as her opportunity to make it big in professional journalism. Wrangling Sid to be her cohort, she is able to not only track down Peter but ends up falling in love with him. The inevitable consequences occur as the plot unspools to reveal who the real murderer is. My primary disappointment with the film comes from Allen's lackadaisical screenplay, an unwieldy hodgepodge of contrived Hitchcock-lite mystery elements, paper-thin characters and his endless kvetching. Even though Allen supplies a steady stream of one-liners, some quite funny, it's the lazy plotting that undermines whatever suspense he tries to generate, in particular, the build-up to the disappointing ending. Allen naturally casts himself as Sid, but he provides the character with so much tired schtick that he becomes tiresome.Even bespectacled, Johansson is an alluring screen presence, a fact obviously not lost on Allen who wrote this script specifically for her. But she seems oddly off-kilter for most of the film, jumping back and forth between her own coolish persona and a bumptious impersonation of Allen's nervous mannerisms. The relationship of their characters never seems particularly believable, but they generate a credible rapport making their comic bantering far more entertaining than the story's romantic angle. As the erudite Lyman, Hugh Jackman cuts the requisite dashing figure, but there is little else to his suspected character, while Ian McShane makes the most of his relatively few scenes as Strombel. What works well unequivocally is the beautiful cinematography from Remi Adefarasin, who makes London and the English countryside look most inviting.

The trouble with evaluating Woody Allen movies is that each film begs comparison to every other one, rather than being permitted a fresh start to stand on its own merits. And Allen fans will seek out his work, while naysayers will avoid it, thereby ruling out the need to critique his movies in the first place, I suppose.So I'll try to steer away from those pitfalls and just contribute my two cents by stating that ""Scoop"" contains enough wit and fun to be engaging entertainment. Sure, the plot revolving around a ""Tarot card killer"" was somewhat underdeveloped, as was the character of Hugh Jackman, as Peter Lymon. But never mind that - if the mystery/thriller genre is your thing, perhaps you shouldn't be choosing Woody Allen films; that's not really what he's about; DUH. In this case the ""plot"" is just a ruse to showcase the humor in unlikely situations, such as a young journalism student and a magician of recent acquaintance masquerading as father/daughter after she receives an invite to a posh estate. Here Allen as the magician/faux parent gets an opportunity to make us laugh, without being hopelessly crude or juvenile, and that's what it's all about, my friend.Also worth a mention is the way death is depicted early on in ""Scoop"", giving me a strong intuitive sense that I was in for a treat.

I love him, I love his work but my love is not blind. I see that his new film is not original, it is not even secondary. He seems to read and re-read Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" lately and he uses the certain scenes and plot devices of the novel in his London period consistently and constantly. He uses the familiar elements of at least three his own earlier movies (but as he said himself - ""if you have to steal, steal from the best"") - I will not reveal them - there is a murder mystery after all :).

The plot of Scoop sounded good and I like both Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  Unfortunately, this film is a bit of a misfire.  The basic idea is excellent:  A dead newspaper reporter has information that a wealthy member of the British aristocracy may be a serial killer.  The reporter escapes from a boat crossing the river Styx long enough to tell a third-rate magician (Allen) and a college student (Johansson) about it.  The execution of this idea is lacking, however.  To begin with, the casting here is a bit off.  I can understand that Allen still wants to appear occasionally in his movies, but he really looks both old and worn out.  I think it would have made more sense to have cast a younger actor in the role, someone who might have been a plausible love interest for Johansson.  Johansson is also a bit miscast as a college student.  I understand her star power, but given her age and the number of films she has been in, casting her as a 20-year old is iffy at best.The plot could also have been better:  Having the dead reporter make only a handful of appearances and then to say things that aren't very funny and don't advance the plot much seemed to be making poor use of a good idea.  Finally, this is meant to be a comedy, but a fair number of the jokes fall flat and most of the rest are good for a smile at best.  The dialogue is not nearly at the level of some of Allen's better films, including Midnight in Paris.Allen has cranked out an enormous number of films.  I think he has been on a pace of about one film per year.  I don't know of another director in modern Hollywood who comes close to matching that output.  Because he is writing the scripts -- by himself in recent years -- and directing and (sometimes) acting, he must be under enormous strain.  If he had more time, I think films like Scoop could have been much better.  Granted, he hit a home run with Midnight in Paris, but for ever home run, he has had several strike outs.  In fact, if he hadn't had so many flops, Midnight in Paris would probably have been booked in more theaters and would have the potential to be a major hit.So, while this film was certainly watchable -- I didn't find myself fast forwarding through it like another reviewer did -- it was definitely a disappointment.  I would recommend it only to die-hard Woody Allen fans.",3,"Watchable, but should have been much better",1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2479,"['recently', 'saw', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'inspired', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'plot', 'Scoop', 'sounded', 'good', 'like', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'bit', 'misfire', 'basic', 'idea', 'excellent', 'dead', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'information', 'wealthy', 'member', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'may', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'reporter', 'boat', 'crossing', 'river', 'Styx', 'long', 'enough', 'tell', 'third-rate', 'magician', 'Allen', 'college', 'student', 'Johansson', 'execution', 'idea', 'lacking', 'however', 'begin', 'casting', 'here', 'bit', 'can', 'understand', 'Allen', 'still', 'appear', 'occasionally', 'movies', 'really', 'old', 'out', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'have', 'cast', 'younger', 'actor', 'role', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'plausible', 'love', 'interest', 'Johansson', 'Johansson', 'also', 'bit', 'miscast', 'college', 'student', 'understand', 'star', 'power', 'given', 'age', 'number', 'films', 'been', 'casting', '20-year', 'old', 'iffy', 'best.The', 'plot', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Having', 'dead', 'reporter', 'make', 'only', 'handful', 'appearances', 'then', 'say', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'much', 'seemed', 'be', 'making', 'poor', 'use', 'good', 'idea', 'Finally', 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'fair', 'number', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'most', 'rest', 'are', 'good', 'smile', 'best', 'dialogue', 'not', 'nearly', 'level', 'Allen', 'better', 'films', 'including', 'Midnight', 'Paris.Allen', 'cranked', 'out', 'enormous', 'number', 'films', 'think', 'been', 'pace', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'director', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'close', 'matching', 'output', 'writing', 'scripts', 'recent', 'years', 'directing', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'must', 'be', 'enormous', 'strain', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'think', 'films', 'Scoop', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Granted', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'ever', 'home', 'run', 'had', 'several', 'strike', 'outs', 'fact', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'so', 'many', 'flops', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'booked', 'more', 'theaters', 'would', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'major', 'hit.So', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'reviewer', 'did', 'was', 'definitely', 'disappointment', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'die-hard', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans']",N/A

This is the second of back to back Woody movies set it England; featuring Johansson.  This movie is best described as a light and airy comedy, with a bit of murder mystery mixed in.  I am compelled to compare it to Manhatten Murder Mystery.  Therin lies the rub.  From a critic, reviewer, and [the] public's standpoint, Woody Allen is in constant competition with himself.  His body of work is phenomenal.  There are great movies and average movies.  Were Scoop to have been directed by a first time director, I wonder what type of reviews it would have received?  I tend to believe that since Woody is so polarizing, this film is held to a higher standard than most others.  I think this film falls in the 3.5 star range.  To begin with, any film with Scarlett Johannson in it is time well spent.  She is a very good actress and is very easy on the eyes.  Hugh Jackman has proven to be a very versatile actor who does a nice job in this movie, which is a bit of a change of pace for him.  The movie is about a college student from America who majors in journalism.  She is in London when she unearths (scoops) a big story.  She meets with a ghost who provides some information about a London serial killer's identity.  With Woody as her magician friend, Johannson embarks on a romance with Jackman who may or may not be involved in the killings.  This movie is a nice little way to spend a couple of hours watching a light and airy comedy, with a dash of mystery mixed in.I give this film 3.5 stars overall, but show it as 4 stars as a nod towards one of the best directors of his day.",4,Woody vs. Woody,1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,1695,"['Scoop', 'directed', 'inimitable', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'very', 'hot', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'second', 'back', 'back', 'Woody', 'movies', 'set', 'England', 'featuring', 'Johansson', 'movie', 'best', 'described', 'light', 'airy', 'comedy', 'bit', 'murder', 'mystery', 'mixed', 'am', 'compelled', 'compare', 'Manhatten', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'Therin', 'rub', 'critic', 'reviewer', ']', 'public', 'standpoint', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'constant', 'competition', 'body', 'work', 'phenomenal', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'average', 'movies', 'Were', 'Scoop', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'wonder', 'what', 'type', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'tend', 'believe', 'Woody', 'so', 'polarizing', 'film', 'held', 'higher', 'standard', 'most', 'others', 'think', 'film', '3.5', 'star', 'range', 'begin', 'film', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'proven', 'be', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'who', 'nice', 'job', 'movie', 'bit', 'change', 'pace', 'movie', 'college', 'student', 'America', 'who', 'majors', 'journalism', 'London', 'when', 'unearths', 'scoops', 'big', 'story', 'ghost', 'who', 'information', 'London', 'serial', 'killer', 'identity', 'Woody', 'magician', 'friend', 'Johannson', 'romance', 'Jackman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'killings', 'movie', 'nice', 'little', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'light', 'airy', 'comedy', 'dash', 'mystery', 'mixed', 'in.I', 'give', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'overall', 'show', '4', 'stars', 'nod', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'day']",N/A

But then Sondra starts to fall for Peter ...I rather liked and enjoyed this film.  However, it is only fair to say that I consider most of Woody's films to be abominations, so my tastes are unlikely to match those of fans.  If you are a fan, you might want to check out other reviews (where you may read sentiments such as ""a disappointment after the brilliant MATCH POINT"").VAGUE SPOILERS FOLLOWIn Sidney Waterman, Woody plays a character who (thank God) is not quite your standard Woody-played character.  He is not (thank God) Sondra's love interest, and his role usually seems to be that of a fellow who has taken a paternal, benevolent and platonic interest in her wellbeing.  The old persona, however, resurfaces too often.  Sidney's whining and self-absorbtion are excessive to the point where they conflict with his role in the story, causing to viewer to wonder why Sydney is agreeing to help Sondra, why Sondra puts up with Sydney, and how such a person could become sufficiently self-sacrificing and risk-taking to fulfill his role in the plot.  When Sidney declares that he was raised Jewish but converted to Narcissism, it is not funny - just a sad-but-true statement about Woody himself that does not quite fit the role he is playing.One scene - the ""don't tickle me"" scene - occurs early in the film when Sidney first meets Sondra.  It is creepy in part for the hint that Sidney was secretly groping Sondra with those fast ""nervous"" hands of his, but mainly because of the result when she tells him to stop.  The whole message of the scene seems to be ""If you tell on me, no-one will care and everyone will laugh.""  It has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and one cannot help wondering what it is about and who it is addressed to.The theme of blackmail or whistle-blowing as a motive for murder resurfaces here, as it has in many prior Woody films, and for once (thank God) the film does not seem to take the side of the killer.  I could not help noticing, though, that the villain's downfall was not that he targeted the blackmailer, but that he unnecessarily and stupidly targeted someone completely loyal to him.

It has Scarlett Johansson in it, and she is very charming in the movie, although it doesn't make a lot of sense that she, a poor American student, winds up living rent-free with an aristocratic British family with connections in the very highest places, but I guess the movie wouldn't have made much sense without this one huge unlikelihood.  Her girlfriend, Vivian, is played by the exquisite Romola Garai, usually seen in high-class BBC filmed versions of Victorian novels like VANITY FAIR, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY, DANIEL DERONDA, but here the spirit of swinging London, just lovely and so appealing I wished that more of the movie would be about her character.  In fact, it seems a definite slip up that she did not fall prey to the infamous ""Tarot Card Killer,"" or at least if someone tried to kill Vivian, then at least there would be a reason for Sondra to interest herself in the affair.  You know, the famous ""this time it's personal"" line of screenplay development.Perhaps this subplot was cut out so that Woody could provide more screentime for Scarlet to insult the great Splendidi.  I couldn't see why he liked her.  She is just awful to him in about every scene, making jokes about ""What did they put in your Metamucil?"" and other putdowns predicated to make her young girl seem like she hated elderly people like himself.  It was sort of the treatment Marlene Dietrich meted out to Emil Jannings in THE BLUE ANGEL, but that was supposed to be a tragedy, and SCOOP a light comedy.  When I saw the movie here in San Francisco, the audience broke out into scattered cheers and applause.  I think we were just glad to have seen a film in which the Woody Allen character was not passionately desired by the young heroine.I fell asleep a few times during the course of the film, but I don't think I missed anything of consequence.  I did see Anthony Stewart Head, ravishing as ever, here playing a British policeman investigating the death of--well, of one of the top stars of the film.  I always enjoyed Anthony Stewart Head when he played Giles in BUFFY, and here he plays a small role with his usual instinct for comedy.  I wouldn't waste my time trying to figure out who is the real killer.  There's only one suspect anyhow.

It stars Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Ian McShane and hunky Hugh Jackman.Johansson goes against her femme fatale and/or wounded woman type as a college journalims student sleuthing the story of a serial murderer in London. Allen plays his signature comic role as a magician that forges a relationship with Johannson and aids her sleuthery. His script is essentially one liners with his unique spontaneity, as always, some of which leave you laughing while others merely amuse you. McShane, whom you may have seen in HBO's ""Deadwood"", is, ironically, a dead reporter that appears as a ghost from time to time to clue in the pair on how to solve the case. Jackman plays a hunky Brit of royal heritage that woos Johansson during her investigation and plays another role in the overall story.This film moves quickly and breezily from scene to scene, never meandering or going into tangents, and always going forward in sprightly comic style. Its English scenery, including the neighborhood surrounding London's majestic Royal Albert Hall, where one of the murders takes place, add a lot to the film's aura.The storyline is weak and cliche-ridden and nothing outside the comic elements of the script does anything to change this. But what most works most against this film is its predictability. There comes a point in the movie where Johansson and ""father"" Allen -- she at one point passes him off as her father -- have used tips and evidence to pin the murders on the obvious perp...but along comes another guy that confesses to them. It's clear to anyone with ears, eyes and a brain that's ever seen one of these movies what's going to transpire in the next 30 minutes and it all transpires just as you'd imagine.Still, this is an enjoyable foray for an evening that will leave comedy fans feeling good when it's concluded...even if you can't remember anything that went on in the story. My greatest enjoyment was seeing Johansson play comedy, something I'd not seen before from this wonderful actress. She is a remarkably effective foil to Allen's consistently humorous one liners and their scenes together are the best part of this movie. Women will no doubt enjoy the various scenes of Jackman as he romances the female lead.In the final analysis, this effective comedy transcends mundane material through the magnetism of its stars and the chemistry Johansson and Allen create in their scenes, where they are uniformly wonderful. While hardly a great film with almost no intellectual value, ""Scoop"" is marvelously entertaining and is one of the swiftest-moving comedies I've seen since ""Love Stinks.""

I have watched it multiple times and believe that its seeming superficiality is intentional. The Scoop in the title is meant to underscore that this film is meant to be as light as a serving of ice cream. It's intended as a treat. I'll even go further and say that this film completes a thematic arc Woody began with Melinda & Melinda, in which competing filmmakers sit around and argue about how to make the same story as either a tragedy or a comedy. Woody himself then went on to make two London-based films about social class and murder, one serious (Match Point) and one trivial (Scoop). It's a reminder that Woody, churning out one film a year, is also a great artist who is developing and reconsidering themes over the course of his ouevre. So, yes, Scoop reminds one of Manhattan Murder Mystery (a funny and underrated Woody film as well), but also betters it, revisiting some of Woody's favourite themes (death, artifice) with a fantastically light touch. This movie seems dumb but isn't, which is part of what tickles me about it. I watch it over and over, and my brain just hums with delight. It's one of the most relaxing DVDs I own. On every level, it works: Scarlett Johansson is the best actress he's found since Diane at delivering his dialogue naturally and easily, and at making it funny, and she looks both fantastic and a little dorky. She's just perfect. And Woody has written himself one of his greatest parts in years as a showbiz hack whose constant riffing on the action is screamingly funny. Last but not least, the film looks fabulous, with lovely photography and production design, so Woody's hit all his marks. Don't be scared away by the negative reviewers. This movie is funny and charming, rewards repeated viewings, and, for Woody Allen fans, a special gem.",5,Scooby-Do for adults.

He proceeds to giving her information that could mean the biggest scoop of his life, pertaining to aristocrat Peter Lyman(Hugh Jackman) and the Tarot Card murders.  With his advice, and the help of magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), she starts the investigation against Peter, but (predictably) falls in love with him. Is he the Tarot-card killer? Is she in any mortal danger?I've always been a huge fan of Woody Allen, even though he's been in a little bit of a slump lately which he seems to have gotten out of since Match Point, so this might be biased.This does resemble some of his earlier work, such as Manhattan Murder Mystery, so it might not seem very original.  But they were done so long ago that putting a modern spin to his genre works.With that in mind, I absolutely LOVED Scoop. I'd say it was one of the best adult, smart, comedies (although comedy-mystery seems more appropriate) of 2006, joining the ranks of Little Miss Sunshine and Thank You For Smoking.I thought the casting and the acting was on-pitch. Scarlett Johansson is competely believable as a young (and dare I say sometimes dorky) college journalist. Hugh Jackman was great, as it has come to be expected. And while I've never been huge on Woody Allen acting in his movies, here it works out great and he turns out to be actually quite endearing.  I thought his performance was great and completely in tune with the tone of the movie, and here he's hilarious, and I loved his sense of humor. But I especially liked the beginning when you see him doing magic tricks on stage as Splendini.This is a movie I'd definitely recommend.  I had a really good time, and I ended up laughing for a great deal of the movie.

It had an intriguing and involving plot, a great performance from Scarlett Johansson, and it was refreshing for Mr. Allen to shift the focus from Manhattan to London.  I loved the film.  By contrast, 'Scoop' is light and lazy.  Hugh Jackman is completely wasted, and the murder theory is undeveloped. Woody returns playing his neurotic self in a typical role that he is now too old for, and a bespectaled Scarlett Johansson playing private eye just isn't very believable.  As mentioned, the script has many holes in it that Woody was too lazy to fix and the entire project has a rushed and unedited feel to it.  It brings to mind the scenes in 'Ed Wood' where Johnny Depp is directing 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and after each scene, no matter how good it is, he yells ""Cut!

172312,A16QODENBJVUI1,1417024917,Robert Moore,"[3, 5]","Of Woody Allen's output in the past twenty-five years, SCOOP is among his more lightly intended efforts.  If all too often during that time Woody has been more auteur than entertainer, here he is almost pure entertainer.  He basically is just trying to give us a good time and for the most part he succeeds.  This is not among his best films, but it is easily one of his most enjoyable of recent years.  Most of the audience comments I overheard upon leaving the preview showing in Chicago were very favorable.SCOOP is one of Woody's odder films in that it is an unusual blend of supernatural fantasy, whodunit (or, rather, did-he-du-it), and romantic comedy.  I won't divulge many plot details except that a newly dead journalist (played by Ian McShane) learns the identity of a serial killer from another newly dead person and determined to pull off one last scoop communicates the information to a young American journalism student (and former dental hygienist--giving rise to many excellent tooth jokes) visiting a friend in London.  The student (played by Scarlett Johansson) elicits the helps of a ham stage magician (Woody), who aids her in her investigation by posing as her father.  The other major cast member is Peter Lyman (played by the remarkable Hugh Jackman, who despite the ire of Dr. Cox on SCRUBS, is one of the most versatile and talented individuals in the movies).This is not a deep movie, but it was not intended as such.  The point is clearly to have a good time, laugh a lot, and enjoy watching Woody spin his tale.  Not all the jokes are funny, but they are plentiful and many of them hit home.  Apart from some astonishingly unfunny one-liners (though, again, many are quite good--though I have to add that if I were to compile a list of the one hundred best Woody Allen one-liners, probably none from the film would make this list), my one real complaint with the film is that the initial set up of the film is handled in cursory fashion.  We aren't really told how or why Ian McShane is able to reappear briefly in the land of the living.  It just happens.  In this way, the film at times just doesn't feel very polished or finished.The cast, as in virtually all Woody Allen films, is excellent.  I am not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, but I thought she was delightful in this.  Most of her films have been rather serious in tone, but I wonder if comedy might not suit her better.  Hugh Jackman is, as always, superb.  My one complaint with his being in the X-MEN movies is that it has kept him from exploring a variety of roles.  I really have no idea what his limits are.  He has excelled in action and comedy.  He has made no film musicals, but he is a highly accomplished veteran of the musical theater.  Not matter what he undertakes he seemingly pulls it off without effort.  Woody was basically Woody as Sid Waterman aka Splendini.  Many roles he has undertaken have been either hard-to-believe or otherwise unsuited for his physique or talent, but this one is perfect.  McShane is a truly amazing actor, but he is underutilized here in what is really a very small, if crucial, part.  As a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER fan, I have to mention a very brief appearance near the end of the film of Anthony Stewart Head (Buffy's Watcher Rupert Giles) as a police inspector.I think this film will please most Woody Allen fans and even many nonfans will enjoy it.  If I had to compare it to a previous film, it would most fairly compare to SMALL TIME CROOKS.  Both are nonambitious efforts to simply entertain.  I think SCOOP is the more successful of the two films.  I certainly encourage fans to check this out and see for themselves.",4,"Not among Woody's best work, but still very entertaining nonetheless",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,3662,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'output', 'past', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'SCOOP', 'more', 'lightly', 'intended', 'efforts', 'too', 'often', 'time', 'Woody', 'been', 'more', 'auteur', 'entertainer', 'here', 'almost', 'pure', 'entertainer', 'basically', 'just', 'trying', 'give', 'good', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'best', 'films', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'recent', 'years', 'Most', 'audience', 'comments', 'overheard', 'leaving', 'preview', 'showing', 'Chicago', 'were', 'very', 'favorable.SCOOP', 'one', 'Woody', 'odder', 'films', 'unusual', 'blend', 'supernatural', 'fantasy', 'whodunit', 'rather', 'did-he-du-it', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'many', 'plot', 'details', 'newly', 'dead', 'journalist', 'played', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'identity', 'serial', 'killer', 'newly', 'dead', 'person', 'determined', 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'last', 'scoop', 'information', 'young', 'American', 'journalism', 'student', 'former', 'dental', 'hygienist', 'giving', 'rise', 'many', 'excellent', 'jokes', 'visiting', 'friend', 'London', 'student', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'helps', 'ham', 'stage', 'magician', 'Woody', 'who', 'investigation', 'posing', 'father', 'other', 'major', 'cast', 'member', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'played', 'remarkable', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'ire', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'SCRUBS', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'talented', 'individuals', 'movies', '.This', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'such', 'point', 'clearly', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Woody', 'spin', 'tale', 'Not', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'plentiful', 'many', 'hit', 'home', 'Apart', 'astonishingly', 'unfunny', 'one-liners', 'again', 'many', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'have', 'add', 'were', 'compile', 'list', 'one', 'hundred', 'best', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one-liners', 'probably', 'none', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'list', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'film', 'initial', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'handled', 'cursory', 'fashion', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'told', 'how', 'why', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'able', 'reappear', 'briefly', 'land', 'living', 'just', 'way', 'film', 'times', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'polished', 'finished.The', 'cast', 'virtually', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'excellent', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'fan', 'thought', 'was', 'delightful', 'Most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'serious', 'tone', 'wonder', 'comedy', 'might', 'not', 'suit', 'better', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'always', 'superb', 'one', 'complaint', 'being', 'X-MEN', 'movies', 'kept', 'exploring', 'variety', 'roles', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'limits', 'are', 'excelled', 'action', 'comedy', 'made', 'film', 'musicals', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'veteran', 'musical', 'theater', 'Not', 'matter', 'what', 'seemingly', 'off', 'effort', 'Woody', 'was', 'basically', 'Woody', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'Splendini', 'Many', 'roles', 'undertaken', 'have', 'been', 'hard-to-believe', 'otherwise', 'unsuited', 'physique', 'talent', 'one', 'perfect', 'McShane', 'truly', 'amazing', 'actor', 'underutilized', 'here', 'what', 'really', 'very', 'small', 'crucial', 'part', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'fan', 'have', 'mention', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'end', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Buffy', 'Watcher', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'police', 'inspector.I', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'please', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans', 'even', 'many', 'nonfans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'had', 'compare', 'previous', 'film', 'would', 'most', 'fairly', 'compare', 'SMALL', 'TIME', 'CROOKS', 'are', 'nonambitious', 'efforts', 'simply', 'entertain', 'think', 'SCOOP', 'more', 'successful', 'two', 'films', 'certainly', 'encourage', 'fans', 'check', 'out', 'see']",N/A

I think some of the reviews complained about the ""flatness"" of Jackman's character, but he really doesn't have much to work with to make himself more dynamic given his supporting part in the movie, so I think some people are just turned off by seeing a movie that includes him NOT acting his heart out.",4,Good Film!,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,821,"['generally', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'gardens', 'city', 'London', 'were', 'nice', 'addition', 'too', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'Rome', 'Love', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'cinematography', 'writing', 'music', 'think', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'one', 'most', 'interesting/complex', 'characters', 'movie', 'too', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'reviews', 'complained', 'flatness', 'Jackman', 'character', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'make', 'more', 'dynamic', 'given', 'supporting', 'part', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'seeing', 'movie', 'NOT', 'acting', 'heart', 'out']",N/A

So I'm not going to call Scoop a horrible movie.  But I will say that it's one of Allen's most forgettable.The movie has one of Allen's most outlandish premises since the early seventies.  An American journalism student is a volunteer in a magic show (Allen plays the magician).  During the trick she's contacted by the ghost of a recently deceased newspaper reporter who wants the girl to help him scoop one last headline.Allen has always made some lighthearted films in between his more serious efforts.  The problem is that this one often feels like a rehash of ""Manhattan Murder Mystery.""  Another problem is that Scarlett Johansson might be a lot prettier than Diane Keaton, but she doesn't come close to replicating Keaton's girlish charm or comic timing.  She seems overwhelmed in this role.  In my opinion she needs to stick with movies like ""Lost in Translation,"" that call for a more low key performance.The movie isn't without it's moments.  Allen does a great job of playing himself, acting as a bumbling sidekick while Johansson gets herself into a few sticky situations.  There are a few twists and turns so that the ending isn't predictable--it's just the plot isn't entirely original, either, and the execution leaves something to be desired.",3,Pretty Average Effort,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,1373,"['love', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'m"", 'willing', 'forgive', 'faults', 'real', 'life', 'art', 'more', 'many', 'people', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'call', 'Scoop', 'horrible', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'forgettable.The', 'movie', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'outlandish', 'premises', 'early', 'seventies', 'American', 'journalism', 'student', 'volunteer', 'magic', 'show', 'Allen', 'magician', 'trick', 'contacted', 'ghost', 'recently', 'deceased', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'girl', 'help', 'scoop', 'one', 'last', 'headline.Allen', 'always', 'made', 'lighthearted', 'films', 'more', 'serious', 'efforts', 'problem', 'one', 'often', 'rehash', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'problem', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'prettier', 'Diane', 'Keaton', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'replicating', 'Keaton', 'girlish', 'charm', 'comic', 'timing', 'overwhelmed', 'role', 'opinion', 'stick', 'movies', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'call', 'more', 'low', 'key', 'performance.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'moments', 'Allen', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'acting', 'bumbling', 'sidekick', 'Johansson', 'few', 'sticky', 'situations', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'so', 'ending', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'just', 'plot', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'original', 'either', 'execution', 'something', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

172327,A3M2WW0PO34B94,1417024917,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[19, 28]","""Scoop"", the new film from director Woody Allen, just doesn't work on any level. I strongly suspect Allen's producers negotiated a budget and allotted time to complete two films. ""Match Point"" took more of both than planned so Allen was left with limited resources. The result? ""Scoop""Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johannson), an American journalism student living in London, attends a magic show with her friend and roommate, Vivian (Romola Garai). The Great Splendini (Allen), aka Sid Waterman, asks Sondra to volunteer for a trick and places her in his disappearing box trick. While waiting inside, Sondra is visited by the spirit of Joe Strombel (Ian McShayne, HBO's ""Deadwood""), the recently deceased British journalism legend. Strombel has learned the scoop of a lifetime; while traveling to heaven, he meets the recently deceased secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) who suspects Lyman, son of a Lord, is the Tarot Card Killer. Sondra enlists the aid of Sid and they set out to uncover the facts. Sondra soon meets the dashing Lyman and they begin dating. As they fall in love, Sid and Joe (who continues to visit them from beyond) continue to insist Peter is a killer and she should keep up her guard.Allen is easily the most frustrating director currently working in the industry. The creator of many great comedies, he has spent the last decade squandering not only his talents, but those of the impressive list of actors who seem to quickly and readily agree to work in his films. Then, last year saw the arrival of a glimmer of hope. ""Match Point"", a surprisingly good, surprisingly different drama from the director. Shot in London, with a predominantly English cast, the film marked a radical departure in setting, tone and story for the director. The film was a tremendous success critically and financially.Now, he follows that success with ""Scoop"", the second consecutive film set in London, starring Scarlett Johannson, and featuring a predominantly British cast. This time, Allen adds himself to the mix of actors and changes the tone to light comedy.""Scoop"" is especially sad because it seems entirely recycled from ideas in Allen's better films. The film opens with a group of British journalists sitting in a pub, discussing their memories of the late, great Joe Strombel. When we first meet Joe, he is riding a ship captained by Death. Sondra and Sid meet during his magic act and attempt to solve a murder case. ""Broadway Danny Rose"", ""Mighty Aphrodite"", Allen's segment of ""New York Stories"" and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"".Filmmakers frequently revisit familiar themes, but blatant recycling usually signifies a lack of ideas.Johannson's Sondra is a troublesome creation and easily the actress' worst role to date. A proclaimed journalism student, we first meet her as she attempts to get an interview with a visiting American film director for the school newspaper. The next day, she nonchalantly announces to her friend that she ended up sleeping with him. With the subject of her interview? Such great journalistic integrity. I can't figure out if this was supposed to be funny or not. It isn't.Johannson rushes through most of her lines, in an attempt to portray Sondra as anxious, but it merely makes her character seem like a high school student in a bad play. It is also difficult to determine the moment Sondra actually falls in love with Peter, because the actress never changes her facial expressions. Every time she is near Peter, she stares at him with adoration, whether she suspects him of murder or not. There is never even the slightest hint of Sondra questioning him or his motives. She simply seems to fall head over heels for him.Allen does his darnedest to provide the film with some funny one liners. Every time he appears on screen, he rattles off a series of intended jokes, attempting to get the audience to laugh and remind us this is a comedy. As he rattles these off, he even conveniently pauses for us to get the punch line and stop laughing, before continuing to the next joke. The only problem is these jokes aren't remotely funny and pausing for the laughter only draws painful attention to this fact.Hugh Jackman plays the dashing Peter Lyman and he fares best of the entire cast. Throughout, he brings a simple, wide-eyed curiosity to Peter's pursuit of Sondra. But he isn't funny either. Or that interesting as he mainly reacts to Johannson and Allen's characters, basically playing the straight man.Ian McShayne, fresh off his critical acclaim for ""Deadwood"", plays Joe Strombel, a legend in British journalistic circles. It is amusing to watch him still pursue a lead, even into the after life, but why would he pick Sondra? It doesn't make any sense. A veteran newsperson would not trust such a tremendous story to someone with no published credits. The man is dead; surely he could pop up in the home of a more respected journalist? After he makes his first appearance, Sid also sees him. But why? It isn't explained and it becomes an inconsistent element in an already inconsistent film.McShayne's role is very small and doesn't do anything to show off the actor's talents. After watching his powerful, mesmerizing work in ""Deadwood"", I was hoping he would have the opportunity to create another memorable character. It didn't happen.Allen has tread the comedy-mystery route before in ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", a far better effort featuring Allen reteaming with his former co-star and lover, Diane Keaton. In it, Keaton and Allen are married and live in a New York apartment building. Keaton soon suspects an aging neighbor of murdering his wife and sets out to uncover the truth, much to Allen's shock. This set-up is more successful because we could see a husband getting roped into his wife's crazy adventures. In ""Scoop"", Sondra immediately partners with Sid, the magician. But why? They are complete strangers when Joe Strombel makes his first appearance. But soon, Sid is following Sondra around, paying for taxis, sodas, etc. Later, he begins masquerading as her father. Thank God for that. At least Allen had the good sense to avoid playing Johannson's boyfriend or `lover'. Why he begins following her around is never fully explained.When Allen's Sid is first introduced as The Great Splendini, he seems amazed that his sorry, bad magic tricks are working, keeping an audience entranced.I am equally amazed that Allen, director of ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Broadway Danny Rose"", ""Match Point"", ""Hannah and her Sisters"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and many others, thought ""Scoop"" was worthy of our time, attention and his name.

172329,AV5G37VFE5NVD,1417024917,Tom Benton,"[42, 52]","Woody Allen seemed to be losing it at the start of the twenty-first century.  The films he released around that time (THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, SMALL TIME CROOKS, etc.) failed to make a lasting (or for that matter positive) impression on audiences.  In 2004 he enjoyed something of a comeback with MELINDA AND MELINDA before bursting back on the scene with his thrilling masterwork MATCH POINT.  Now he's back to whip up another slice of cinema greatness, and this is a slice considerably sweeter than (though not as classy as) MATCH POINT.  This is SCOOP, one of the most delightful romantic comedies of the year.SCOOP revolves around Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), an American college student eyeing a career in journalism.  While vacationing in England with a friend, she visits a magic show run by the timid Sid Waterman (Woody Allen).  Sid decides to use Sondra in a magic trick involving a box from which Sondra will supposedly disappear.  Instead of disappearing, Sondra watches as famous - and recently diseased - journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) appears.  Joe gives Sondra a tip on who may be the notorious ""Tarot Card Killer"" before vanishing into thin air.  Now it's up to Sondra, along with incompetent magician Sid, to follow a lead from a dead journalist and investigate the man who may be a vicious serial killer: irresistible (and rich) bachelor Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman).SCOOP is a compelling and thoroughly entertaining picture.  It's not an unforgettable film, nor one that could be considered a moviemaking milestone.  Much of the film's charm comes from the fact that it doesn't try to be.  What it does try to be is a witty, entertaining, fun and funny mystery film, and that's exactly what it is.  Much of the credit for this should go to Allen's taut, fine-tuned script.  It has laughs a plenty, thrilling mystery, and not a slow spot in sight.The rest of the credit goes to the cast.  Though most people are accustomed to seeing Johansson portray scalding hot blonde bombshells in films like THE BLACK DAHLIA and MATCH POINT, her performance as a geeky young college student is surprisingly convincing.  Jackman, as always,  shines; he's every bit as charismatic as his character, and then some.  With actors as great as these, it's a little surprising that Allen himself is the highlight of the cast.  Sid the magician's foolishness isn't irking at all; in fact, it's immensely amusing, and Sid winds up as an almost adorable character rather than the bothersome twit he could have been.  As a huge BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER fan, I was also immensely pleased to see Anthony Stewart Head pop up toward the end of the film as a detective.Ashamed as I am to admit it, as of this writing I have seen only one other Woody Allen film, MATCH POINT.  Thus I can't make any remarks about where SCOOP ranks in comparison to Allen's many previous films.  I can and will say this, however: SCOOP is a delight.  It's not grand, and it doesn't try to be.  It is what it is: a very entertaining, very funny, very fun film, and a great way to spend two hours.",4,"A very entertaining, very funny, and very fun film",1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,3086,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'seemed', 'be', 'losing', 'start', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'films', 'released', 'time', 'THE', 'CURSE', 'THE', 'JADE', 'SCORPION', 'SMALL', 'TIME', 'CROOKS', 'etc', 'failed', 'make', 'lasting', 'matter', 'positive', 'impression', 'audiences', '2004', 'enjoyed', 'something', 'comeback', 'MELINDA', 'AND', 'MELINDA', 'bursting', 'back', 'scene', 'thrilling', 'masterwork', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'Now', 'back', 'whip', 'up', 'slice', 'cinema', 'greatness', 'slice', 'considerably', 'sweeter', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'classy', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'SCOOP', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'year.SCOOP', 'Sondra', 'Pransky', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'American', 'college', 'student', 'eyeing', 'career', 'journalism', 'vacationing', 'England', 'friend', 'magic', 'show', 'run', 'timid', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Sid', 'use', 'Sondra', 'magic', 'trick', 'involving', 'box', 'Sondra', 'will', 'supposedly', 'disappear', 'Instead', 'disappearing', 'Sondra', 'as', 'famous', 'recently', 'diseased', 'journalist', 'Joe', 'Strombel', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Joe', 'Sondra', 'tip', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'notorious', 'Tarot', 'Card', 'Killer', 'vanishing', 'thin', 'air', 'Now', 'up', 'Sondra', 'incompetent', 'magician', 'Sid', 'follow', 'lead', 'dead', 'journalist', 'investigate', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'vicious', 'serial', 'killer', 'irresistible', 'rich', 'bachelor', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', '.SCOOP', 'compelling', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'picture', 'not', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'moviemaking', 'milestone', 'Much', 'film', 'charm', 'fact', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'What', 'try', 'be', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'funny', 'mystery', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'Much', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'Allen', 'taut', 'fine-tuned', 'script', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'mystery', 'not', 'slow', 'spot', 'sight.The', 'rest', 'credit', 'cast', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'Johansson', 'portray', 'scalding', 'hot', 'blonde', 'bombshells', 'films', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'DAHLIA', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'performance', 'geeky', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'Jackman', 'always', 'shines', 'bit', 'as', 'charismatic', 'character', 'then', 'actors', 'as', 'great', 'little', 'surprising', 'Allen', 'highlight', 'cast', 'Sid', 'magician', 'foolishness', ""n't"", 'irking', 'fact', 'immensely', 'amusing', 'Sid', 'up', 'almost', 'adorable', 'character', 'rather', 'bothersome', 'twit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'fan', 'was', 'also', 'immensely', 'pleased', 'see', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'pop', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'detective.Ashamed', 'am', 'admit', 'writing', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'Thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'remarks', 'where', 'SCOOP', 'comparison', 'Allen', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'can', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'SCOOP', 'delight', 'not', 'grand', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'what', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'fun', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours']",N/A
172330,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1417024917,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""I have a mixed feeling about ""Scoop,"" Woody Allen's contemporary comedy set in London. On the one hand the comedy has very funny moments and provides several nice twists in the story. The performances of the actors are largely good with Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman, plus cameos of respected British veterans like Charles Dance and John Sanding. And you just can't complain about Ms. Johansson in a swimming suit.On the other hand, however, I couldn't shake off the feeling of ""I have seen this before"" while watching ""Scoop"" which is about Johansson's character American journalism student trying to get a scoop on the serial killer, with Woody Allen's magician in tow. I'm talking about ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" and OK, I know, ""Scoop"" opens differently, with the ghost of recently deceased journalist (Ian McShane) coming back to our world in a hilarious way. Hugh Jackman is also great with menace hidden in his eye, as a billionaire's son and possible murderer of the recent serial killings.But I seriously miss Diane Keaton and her perfect comic timing that easily made the annoying and officious wife in ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" so endearing. The comparison may not be fair (after all Diane Keaton was, and is, a close friend to Allen), but still I must say something seems missing between Johansson's college student and Allen's nervous magician. Maybe Scarlett Johansson, talented as she is, is too young and beautiful to be delightfully nerdy, reckless and meddling; or maybe Allen is relying too much on his old tricks, his ultra-nervous fast mumbling; or it's just lack of chemistry.""Scoop"" is a light comedy that delivers laughs.

Scarlett Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, a geeky college journalist vacationing in England. She gets a tip from the ghost of a dead newsman (Ian McShane) on the identity of a local serial killer and proceeds to team up with bumbling magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen); the tip leads them to the rich son of a prominent lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), with whom Sondra unintentionally starts to fall in love. Is Lyman the notorious killer or isn't he?Although fantastical and somewhat goofy, ""Scoop"" is first and foremost a mystery and I did enjoy trying to figure out if Peter Lyman is the ""Tarot Card killer."" In the story we perceive Peter Lyman largely through the lens of Sondra, who is falling in love with the guy; hence, the viewer warms up to him and doesn't want him to be a notorious killer.""Scoop"" is a comedy but not in the laugh-out-loud sense of, say, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective""; it's mildly amusing, witty and fun but generally not knee-slapping funny, so if you're looking for the latter don't bother.The three stars and their chemistry are a highlight. I enjoyed the team-up of Woody (Sid) & Scarlett (Sondra) and their surrogate father/daughter relationship. I knew when I saw ""The Horse Whisperer"" that Scarlett would grow up to be one of cinema's leading beauties, and so she is! Scarlett was 21 while filming ""Scoop"" and plays against type; and she does it quite well. The film is worth catching solely for her, just don't expect any raunch or t&a; exploitation (although she does have a one-piece bathing suit scene and a nightie scene, which are both rather modest).Hugh Jackman is a great modern masculine actor, of course, and he does fine here, although I couldn't help wondering if long metal claws would suddenly shoot out of his knuckles!The London and English countryside locations are nice eyecandy.The runtime is 96 minutes.FINAL WORD: This is my first Woody Allen film so I'm not familiar with his r&eacute;pertoire and therefore can't compare ""Scoop"" with his other movies. With this in mind, ""Scoop"" is an enjoyable mystery/comedy highlighted by refreshing originality, a good cast with good chemistry and English locations. I admit that I didn't think I'd like the film during the first 25 minutes or so (I also admit that I mainly bought it for Scarlett Johnansson, who doesn't disappoint), but then I ""caught a grip"" on the vibe of the movie. The interactions between the three main characters, their story and the mounting mystery pulled me in and glued me until the end. I also enjoyed the creative zany elements (e.g. crossing the River Styx with the Grim Reaper and the reappearing ghost reporter) and the film's overall refreshing air.In fact, for some strange reason I love ""Scoop"".GRADE: B+ (I originally rated it ""B"" but this is one of those films you like more each time you view it; hence, the next time I see it I'll probably jump it up to A- and so on)",4,Enjoyable mystery/comedy with Scarlett Johansson,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3004,"['Scoop', 'mystery/comedy/romance', 'written', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'released', '2006', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Sondra', 'Pransky', 'geeky', 'college', 'journalist', 'vacationing', 'England', 'tip', 'ghost', 'dead', 'newsman', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'identity', 'local', 'serial', 'killer', 'proceeds', 'team', 'up', 'bumbling', 'magician', 'Sid', 'Waterman', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'tip', 'rich', 'son', 'prominent', 'lord', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'whom', 'Sondra', 'unintentionally', 'fall', 'love', 'Lyman', 'notorious', 'killer', ""n't"", 'fantastical', 'somewhat', 'goofy', 'Scoop', 'first', 'foremost', 'mystery', 'did', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'Tarot', 'Card', 'killer', 'story', 'perceive', 'Peter', 'Lyman', 'largely', 'lens', 'Sondra', 'who', 'falling', 'love', 'guy', 'hence', 'viewer', 'up', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'notorious', 'killer', 'Scoop', 'comedy', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sense', 'say', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'witty', 'fun', 'generally', 'not', 'knee-slapping', 'funny', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'latter', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother.The', 'three', 'stars', 'chemistry', 'are', 'highlight', 'enjoyed', 'team-up', 'Woody', 'Sid', 'Scarlett', 'Sondra', 'surrogate', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'knew', 'when', 'saw', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'Scarlett', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'cinema', 'leading', 'beauties', 'so', 'Scarlett', 'was', '21', 'filming', 'Scoop', 'plays', 'type', 'quite', 'well', 'film', 'worth', 'catching', 'solely', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'raunch', 't', 'exploitation', 'have', 'one-piece', 'bathing', 'suit', 'scene', 'nightie', 'scene', 'are', 'rather', 'modest', 'Jackman', 'great', 'modern', 'masculine', 'actor', 'course', 'fine', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'long', 'metal', 'claws', 'would', 'suddenly', 'shoot', 'knuckles', 'London', 'English', 'countryside', 'locations', 'are', 'nice', 'eyecandy.The', 'runtime', '96', 'minutes.FINAL', 'WORD', 'first', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'r', 'eacute', 'pertoire', 'therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Scoop', 'other', 'movies', 'mind', 'Scoop', 'enjoyable', 'mystery/comedy', 'highlighted', 'refreshing', 'originality', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'chemistry', 'English', 'locations', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'also', 'admit', 'mainly', 'bought', 'Scarlett', 'Johnansson', 'who', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'then', 'caught', 'grip', 'vibe', 'movie', 'interactions', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'mounting', 'mystery', 'pulled', 'glued', 'end', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'creative', 'zany', 'elements', 'e.g', 'crossing', 'River', 'Styx', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'reappearing', 'ghost', 'reporter', 'film', 'overall', 'refreshing', 'air.In', 'fact', 'strange', 'reason', 'love', 'Scoop', '.GRADE', 'B+', 'originally', 'rated', 'B', 'one', 'films', 'more', 'time', 'view', 'hence', 'next', 'time', 'see', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'jump', 'up', 'A-', 'so']",N/A
