988293,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000FDEUYO,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 3]","I will not be the first to observe that to look at life is to look at death, as they say at Chinese restaurants, ""It comes with.""  This movie is quick to remind us that we spend our lives looking away, pretending that death is a foreigner, instead of a brother.  For various reasons all the people in this movie are exceptional, looking at death the way they would look at their reflections in the mirror, and we get to see how they handle it.The ""cross-cut"" scripting will remind viewers of Crash and/or Magnolia, two lousy movies that tried unsuccessfully to kluge random bits of footage together by using BIG themes. In Crash the big theme was racism, in fact, it was as though Hollywood had a party so it could pat itself on the back for discovering racism - you go girl!  In Magnolia the big theme was squeezing in as many celebrity cameos as possible - (you know you've got problems when a frog-storm steals your movie).  Watch Magnolia again.  John C. Reilly, who has demonstrated his ability to be a consistently awful actor, is even more awful than usual.  It's as though his idea of acting is anti-acting.Look Both Ways unifies its rag-tag cast with mood (hot Australia), superb cinematography, and key places used as leitmotifs (the train yard - the mural) - as well as the absolutely splendid animations of its star, Meryl, Justine Clark.  Clark's likeability gives the film its greatest strength; her morbid obsessions are in hilarious juxtaposition to the chirpy greeting cards she makes for a living.  Nick, her love interest, William McInnes, is a bit harder to warm up to.  Then again, his wooden demeanor, (not to mention the bloodless dispassion that comes with his job, press photographer), has been earned, he just found out he's dying of cancer.  Which of course is the starting point for this film - everybody's dying one way or another.  Or, to put it another way, every life is complete and completely lived; the only difference between them is the length.If you hadn't gotten it yet, director Sarah Watt makes sure you do with the introduction of Anna's pregnancy.  There is no joy associated with this news; it merely has the power of reminding Andy and Anna that what they have is no relationship at all.  Meantime Andy, a journalist, is working on a series of articles he hopes will prove that most fatal accidents, especially among men, are not accidents but suicides.  Laughing yet?  Look Both Ways is not a great film, but it's very good.  Unlike Crash and Magnolia, which were slick, smug, and glib, it feels authentic and hand-made.  The characters seem real, if not uniformly likeable, and they really are confronting something we rarely if ever are brave enough to confront ourselves - and isn't that one of art's untidy duties?",4,At The Same Time,1180569600,"05 31, 2007",2007,2764,"['will', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'observe', 'look', 'life', 'look', 'death', 'say', 'Chinese', 'restaurants', 'movie', 'quick', 'remind', 'spend', 'lives', 'looking', 'away', 'pretending', 'death', 'foreigner', 'instead', 'brother', 'various', 'reasons', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'exceptional', 'looking', 'death', 'way', 'would', 'look', 'reflections', 'mirror', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'handle', 'it.The', 'cross-cut', 'scripting', 'will', 'remind', 'viewers', 'Crash', 'and/or', 'Magnolia', 'two', 'lousy', 'movies', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'kluge', 'random', 'bits', 'footage', 'together', 'using', 'BIG', 'themes', 'Crash', 'big', 'theme', 'was', 'racism', 'fact', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'party', 'could', 'pat', 'back', 'discovering', 'racism', 'go', 'girl', 'Magnolia', 'big', 'theme', 'was', 'squeezing', 'as', 'many', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'possible', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'problems', 'when', 'frog-storm', 'steals', 'movie', 'Watch', 'Magnolia', 'again', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'ability', 'be', 'consistently', 'awful', 'actor', 'even', 'more', 'awful', 'usual', 'idea', 'acting', 'anti-acting.Look', 'Both', 'Ways', 'rag-tag', 'cast', 'mood', 'hot', 'Australia', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'key', 'places', 'used', 'leitmotifs', 'train', 'yard', 'mural', 'as', 'well', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'animations', 'star', 'Meryl', 'Justine', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'likeability', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'morbid', 'obsessions', 'are', 'hilarious', 'juxtaposition', 'chirpy', 'greeting', 'cards', 'living', 'Nick', 'love', 'interest', 'William', 'McInnes', 'bit', 'harder', 'warm', 'up', 'Then', 'again', 'wooden', 'demeanor', 'not', 'mention', 'bloodless', 'dispassion', 'job', 'press', 'photographer', 'been', 'earned', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Which', 'course', 'starting', 'point', 'film', 'everybody', 'dying', 'one', 'way', 'put', 'way', 'life', 'complete', 'completely', 'lived', 'only', 'difference', 'length.If', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'director', 'Sarah', 'Watt', 'sure', 'do', 'introduction', 'Anna', 'pregnancy', 'joy', 'associated', 'news', 'merely', 'power', 'reminding', 'Andy', 'Anna', 'what', 'have', 'relationship', 'Meantime', 'Andy', 'journalist', 'working', 'series', 'articles', 'will', 'prove', 'most', 'fatal', 'accidents', 'especially', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'accidents', 'suicides', 'Laughing', 'yet', 'Look', 'Ways', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'Crash', 'Magnolia', 'were', 'slick', 'smug', 'glib', 'authentic', 'hand-made', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'not', 'uniformly', 'likeable', 'really', 'are', 'confronting', 'something', 'rarely', 'ever', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'confront', ""n't"", 'one', 'art', 'untidy', 'duties']",Look Both Ways
988294,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000FDEUYO,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 9]","Death is a touchy subject to broach regardless of the medium in which you choose to expose it. It's uncomfortable to even think about yet touches us all on many levels, and that is why LOOK BOTH WAYS succeeds.Building on death in thought-provoking, sad, and often hilarious terms, Look Both Ways binds a small Australian community together after the death of a man upon the local railroad tracks. Meryl (Justine Clarke, DANNY DECKCHAIR) witnesses the horrible event and summons the authorities. The local media shows up, including photojournalist Nick (William McInnes, IRRESISTIBLE) who's just been diagnosed with a rapidly spreading cancer. Also on the scene is Nick's newspaper partner Andy (Anthony Hayes, NED KELLY) and eventually the deceased's wife Julia (Daniella Farinacci, BROTHERS).Meryl sees the event as just another death, something that fill her thoughts and her paintings on a daily basis. Her vivid imagination surrounding death is illustrated (literally) via laughingly silly animated sequences that are sure to tickle your dark funny bone. Photojournalist Nick sees himself on the railroad tracks, having just received a medical death sentence of metastatic testicular cancer. Newspaper writer Andy battles to understand life and death while struggling to be a good father to his divorced children, and the discovery that his new girlfriend is pregnant with an unwanted child. Widow Julia tries to understand the seemingly meaninglessness of her husband's death as flowers flow into her home and she's forced to come to grips with such a sudden loss.Where Look Both Ways succeeds is in its delivery. Each person views death under their own unique umbrella, but are bound together by this one tragic event. Meryl and Nick become oddball lovers during a one night stand, while newsman Andy tries to sort through his chaotic and merciless lifestyle. Widow Julia and the engineer who was driving the train are two of the more interesting cases within the story, as they have no speaking parts until the very end, but are given ample screen time which speaks volumes on its own.The message of the flick is simple but not forced: look at death both ways. See it as a necessity but don't dwell on it. There is hope and fear within it, operating not at opposite ends of the spectrum, but as a gauge on how to live life without death looming ever present on one's mind.Meryl, the one who the film is mostly about, learns this lesson the hard way, coming to terms with her own fate, and that of Nick who's cancerous life is destined to plow into hers with the force of a padded sledgehammer.",4,Look At Death But Don't Dwell On It,1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,2600,"['Death', 'touchy', 'subject', 'broach', 'regardless', 'medium', 'choose', 'expose', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'think', 'yet', 'touches', 'many', 'levels', 'why', 'LOOK', 'BOTH', 'WAYS', 'succeeds.Building', 'death', 'thought-provoking', 'sad', 'often', 'hilarious', 'terms', 'Look', 'Both', 'Ways', 'small', 'Australian', 'community', 'together', 'death', 'man', 'local', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'Meryl', 'Justine', 'Clarke', 'DANNY', 'DECKCHAIR', 'horrible', 'event', 'summons', 'authorities', 'local', 'media', 'up', 'including', 'photojournalist', 'Nick', 'William', 'McInnes', 'IRRESISTIBLE', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'rapidly', 'spreading', 'cancer', 'Also', 'scene', 'Nick', 'newspaper', 'partner', 'Andy', 'Anthony', 'Hayes', 'NED', 'KELLY', 'eventually', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Daniella', 'Farinacci', 'BROTHERS', '.Meryl', 'event', 'just', 'death', 'something', 'thoughts', 'paintings', 'daily', 'basis', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'surrounding', 'death', 'illustrated', 'literally', 'laughingly', 'silly', 'animated', 'sequences', 'are', 'sure', 'tickle', 'dark', 'funny', 'bone', 'Photojournalist', 'Nick', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'having', 'just', 'received', 'medical', 'death', 'sentence', 'metastatic', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'Newspaper', 'writer', 'Andy', 'understand', 'life', 'death', 'struggling', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'divorced', 'children', 'discovery', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'unwanted', 'child', 'Widow', 'Julia', 'understand', 'seemingly', 'meaninglessness', 'husband', 'death', 'flowers', 'flow', 'home', 'forced', 'come', 'grips', 'sudden', 'loss.Where', 'Look', 'Both', 'Ways', 'delivery', 'person', 'death', 'own', 'unique', 'umbrella', 'are', 'bound', 'together', 'one', 'tragic', 'event', 'Meryl', 'Nick', 'become', 'oddball', 'lovers', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'newsman', 'Andy', 'tries', 'sort', 'chaotic', 'merciless', 'lifestyle', 'Widow', 'Julia', 'engineer', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'train', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'interesting', 'cases', 'story', 'have', 'speaking', 'parts', 'very', 'end', 'are', 'given', 'ample', 'screen', 'time', 'volumes', 'own.The', 'message', 'flick', 'simple', 'not', 'forced', 'look', 'death', 'ways', 'See', 'necessity', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'hope', 'fear', 'operating', 'not', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'gauge', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'death', 'looming', 'ever', 'present', 'one', 'mind.Meryl', 'one', 'who', 'film', 'mostly', 'about', 'hard', 'way', 'coming', 'terms', 'own', 'fate', 'Nick', 'who', 'cancerous', 'life', 'destined', 'plow', 'hers', 'force', 'padded', 'sledgehammer']",Look Both Ways
988295,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000FDEUYO,Brendan M. Howard,"[15, 16]","In one of this Australian drama's best scenes, two characters obsessed with death look a different way. One is an artist, Meryl Lee (Clarke), who turns everyday events in her imagination into fatal accidents and crimes after the sudden passing of her father. The other is a globe-trotting photographer, Nick (McInnes), who in the movie's first few minutes is diagnosed with testicular cancer that's traveled to his lungs. He starts seeing, in photographic montages, terrible sickness and death. The two are awkwardly flirting in Meryl's apartment after unexpected encounters at the scene of an accident and the next day on the street. They both anxiously confide in each other that they see death when they look at people, then just as anxiously ask if they see death when they look at each other. Both answer no. In just a few days' time, their relationship grows just as suddenly as the cancer tumors Nick imagines bursting from his body and the faces of strangers.But that's just one piece of the film's narrative, which also boasts a Crash-like intermingling of people, events, hopes and fears with unplanned pregnancies, reformed workaholics, terrible grief and familial reconciliation. However, unlike Crash -- a film about racism that beat viewers over the head with its message -- Look Both Ways tackles the ultimate equalizer, death, with gentle touches and a believable dialogue and story.The film's message and satisfying happy ending?

So wrote Shakespeare in Macbeth. Whether he was right is the question that every character in this film struggles to answer. The plot revolves around a train wreck, and how the various people related to that wreck and to the newspaper that reported the story (the editor, a reporter, the wife, the train worker), interpret the event. Was it suicide? Negligence? Fate? Murder? The artist Meryl hallucinates about this and many other Freudian fears (cleverly represented by animation).

988299,A35DSAZ6TD3J3W,B000FDEUYO,Marc Albert,"[2, 2]","""Look Both Ways"" is about life and death, grief and joy, how lives are linked and forces the characters to take stock in their lives.  It takes place over a 3-day weekend and looks into the lives of a few Australian characters, how they experience and react to life and the death that will come to us all, to some, sooner than later.  Filmed in Adelaide, Australia, a low budget movie about ordinary people, I found it to be a very moving picture.  It teaches us to live in the now and relish and yes, ravish what we've have, our lives and those we care about.  The theme song ""Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone"" is a haunting melody that only adds to enjoyment and meaning of this of this film.I've listened to this song and watched the movie many times, only to snatch and extract another ""tidbit"" from it that I'd missed in a previous viewing.  The only problem I can see is not to forget the lessons this story teaches us in how to conduct ourselves in our day-to-day living, getting the most out of that existence, taking stock every once in a while of ones own life and not dwell on the eventual death.  It is so easy to forget the important stuff and focus on the trivial.  No need to spell out the story to you, there are enough reviewers who have already done that.  Besides, it works best if you don't know what's coming.We're all going to die eventually and to steal a line from the movie; ""it doesn't matter how life ends, it matters how it was.""

988302,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000FDEUYO,mirasreviews,"[4, 8]","""Look Both Ways"" is one of those movies about people who get themselves all tied up into knots over....whatever. In this case, it's over death. In a small Australian city, a lonely thirty-something greeting card artist named Meryl (Justine Clarke) witnesses a man be killed by a train when he tries to prevent his dog from being hit. Nick (William McInnes), a photographer from a local paper who arrives on the scene, takes a liking to Meryl. He wants a girlfriend but is reluctant, because he just found out he has cancer. Meanwhile, Andy (Anthony Hayes), an obnoxious reporter who interviewed Meryl and speculated needlessly about the tragedy is feeling put-upon by pregnant ex-girlfriend Anna (Lisa Flanagan), who can't decide if she's going to have the baby or not.You'll like this movie or hate it depending upon your feelings about the characters. Some people will identify with their angst. I find them insufferably neurotic. Meryl is a fearful woman whose morbid anxieties are expressed in animation, so we can see them. At least she has a morbid sense of humor too. Nick is testy because he has cancer, but that's not interesting. I could not tell you why Andy and Anna are in such an aggravated state. In the background are the two people who are actually affected by the unfortunate death on the train tracks: the victim's girlfriend and the driver of the train. They frame the film, but it's not about them. It's about the constant presence of death in our lives and how people cope with it...or fixate on it, as the case may be. ""Look Both Ways"" is ultimately optimistic, but I couldn't stand 5 minutes with these characters.The DVD (Kino Video 2006): In ""An Interview with Sarah Watt"" (13 min), writer/director Watt talks about bringing the characters' interior lives to the audience through the animated sequences, the structure of the film, Meryl's character, and casting Justine Clarke. In ""An Interview with Justine Clarke"" (14 min), the actress tells us how she got the part, doing her own painting in the film, and discusses the Nick-Meryl relationship and their argument scene at length.

988307,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000FDEUYO,William Timothy Lukeman,"[4, 4]","What a wonderful discovery! I had no idea this film existed, and only stumbled upon it by accident ... or serendipity? You'll definitely give a lot more thought to coincidence, and the random nature of life, and the delicate web of unseen connections, after watching this thoughtful story.From the mysteriously swerving flights of birds to the regular passage of trains, we're reminded of the nature of existence -- both certain & uncertain. When a single death occurs, the lives of countless people are affected & interwoven. And the possibility of death has an equally powerful effect, making the film's characters & its viewers alike more aware, more conscious, of the world we all take for granted.What's especially impressive is how writer/director Sarah Watt handles this existentially ponderous material with a sure, understated hand. Her background as an animator comes into play, not merely in the fantasy images of Meryl's fears, but in Watt's ability to trust in the image, the actor's face, the slightest pause, to convey a wealth of emotions. No need for painfully obvious exposition here!And the actors are superb. Thankfully looking like real people rather than models, the characters negotiate life in a welter of mixed emotions, often saying or doing the wrong thing, then realizing it just a moment too late. You get the feeling that you could meet these people, get to know them in everyday life. From Nick & Meryl's hesitant romance, to the emotionally shattered train driver & his family, to Andy's anger & fear, these are all honest portraits of familiar people.But if this is a film about death, it's also about life. Children appear throughout the film, quite significantly, and the adults are brought to thresholds of new awareness. Again, none of this is done in a heavy-handed fashion. Watt relies on humor & awkwardness to carry a lot of the weight, and the film's all the more effective for it. Sobering without being bleak, funny without being glib, it leaves the viewer contemplative after the final credits have faded to black.Most highly recommended!",5,In the midst of life ...,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,2083,"['What', 'wonderful', 'discovery', 'had', 'idea', 'film', 'existed', 'only', 'stumbled', 'accident', 'serendipity', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'give', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'coincidence', 'random', 'nature', 'life', 'delicate', 'web', 'unseen', 'connections', 'watching', 'thoughtful', 'mysteriously', 'swerving', 'flights', 'birds', 'regular', 'passage', 'trains', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'nature', 'existence', 'certain', 'uncertain', 'When', 'single', 'death', 'occurs', 'lives', 'countless', 'people', 'are', 'affected', 'interwoven', 'possibility', 'death', 'equally', 'powerful', 'effect', 'making', 'film', 'characters', 'viewers', 'alike', 'more', 'aware', 'more', 'conscious', 'world', 'take', 'granted.What', 'especially', 'impressive', 'how', 'writer/director', 'Sarah', 'Watt', 'existentially', 'ponderous', 'material', 'sure', 'understated', 'hand', 'background', 'animator', 'play', 'not', 'merely', 'fantasy', 'images', 'Meryl', 'fears', 'Watt', 'ability', 'trust', 'image', 'actor', 'face', 'slightest', 'pause', 'convey', 'wealth', 'emotions', 'need', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'exposition', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'Thankfully', 'looking', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'models', 'characters', 'negotiate', 'life', 'welter', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'often', 'saying', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'then', 'realizing', 'just', 'moment', 'too', 'late', 'get', 'feeling', 'could', 'meet', 'people', 'get', 'know', 'everyday', 'life', 'Nick', 'Meryl', 'hesitant', 'romance', 'emotionally', 'shattered', 'train', 'driver', 'family', 'Andy', 'anger', 'fear', 'are', 'honest', 'portraits', 'familiar', 'people.But', 'film', 'death', 'also', 'about', 'life', 'Children', 'appear', 'film', 'quite', 'significantly', 'adults', 'are', 'brought', 'thresholds', 'new', 'awareness', 'Again', 'none', 'done', 'heavy-handed', 'fashion', 'Watt', 'humor', 'awkwardness', 'carry', 'lot', 'weight', 'film', 'more', 'effective', 'Sobering', 'being', 'bleak', 'funny', 'being', 'glib', 'viewer', 'contemplative', 'final', 'credits', 'have', 'faded', 'black.Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",Look Both Ways
