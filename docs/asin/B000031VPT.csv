I find myself fast forwarding through the warmup of the following section in order to maintain the momentum of the cardio intensity. A much longer cardio routine, with less segments would work great. The other drawback of this video, is the warmup and especially the cooldown section, is almost non-existant. These things are crucial, especially for a beginning exerciser, who doesn't know what to incorporate to bring the heartrate down when the cardio section is through. These few additions would make this video good. I do like Tracey's combinations and she keeps you psyched throughout.",2,a bit brief,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,797,"['do', 'concept', 'Cardio', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'do', 'enjoy', 'enthusiasm', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'moves', 'believe', 'workout', '3', 'brief', 'segments', ""n't"", 'give', 'ample', 'time', 'real', 'workout', 'find', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'warmup', 'following', 'section', 'order', 'maintain', 'momentum', 'cardio', 'intensity', 'much', 'longer', 'cardio', 'routine', 'less', 'segments', 'would', 'work', 'great', 'other', 'drawback', 'video', 'warmup', 'especially', 'cooldown', 'section', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'things', 'are', 'crucial', 'especially', 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'incorporate', 'bring', 'heartrate', 'down', 'when', 'cardio', 'section', 'few', 'additions', 'would', 'make', 'video', 'good', 'do', 'Tracey', 'combinations', 'psyched']",The Method - Cardio Boot Camp VHS

Tracey seems to be a little over-the-top at first, but if she can endear herself to me, she can probably endear herself to anyone.Because this workout is certainly high-impact, I don't really like to do it too often---mainly when I'm feeling like I've been super-lazy and not exercised enough.P.S.

The crew behind the leader sometimes make mistakes, putting the novice at ease: no one is perfect!

I have run through the video once, doing all three workouts.The instructor has a cute English accent and gives frequent cues.  The set was non-distracting and the background exercisers nearly flawless.  The production quality of this DVD is very good.Buyers frequently want to know ""how easy is this video?""

There is plenty of repetition of the sequences, and I was able to make it through all three segments without any moments of frustration.  That said, there is LOTS of repitition.  Segment 3 feels like deja-vu of segment 1.Cardio Boot Camp made this veteran exerciser sweat.  Although the warmups at the beginning of each segment did bring down my heart rate, there were plenty of high-intensity segments.  Plyometrics were used, increasing power and calorie burn.  There were also short segments of strength-training.  3-pound weights are recommended with this video, but I used a Go-Fit rubber tube instead.  The weight-lifting segments often use multiple body parts, like doing lunges while also doing shoulder exercises.  This kept my heart rate up as I strength-trained.The frequent jumping and squats could be hard on some people's knees, although my knees didn't complain during this video (and they usually do hurt).
