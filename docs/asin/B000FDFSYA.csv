988566,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000FDFSYA,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a somewhat typical WWII Holocaust story, albeit with a bit of a twist because it takes place in Denmark. It is the story of a partisan fighter who falls in love with a Jewish girl right around the time that Danish Jewish population needed to flee the country to avoid a looming Nazi crackdown. He is rescued by the girl after being shot in an attack and nursed back to health by her in spite of her father's concerns about the situation. Later, he helps her family and many other Jewish residents of the country flee. This is a fairly low-key film with reasonably good acting. It isn't an effects-laden war movie, but rather a thoughtful rendition of a lesser-known WWII story.",4,Interesting story,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,685,"['somewhat', 'typical', 'WWII', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'bit', 'twist', 'place', 'Denmark', 'story', 'partisan', 'fighter', 'who', 'love', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'right', 'time', 'Danish', 'Jewish', 'population', 'needed', 'flee', 'country', 'avoid', 'looming', 'Nazi', 'crackdown', 'rescued', 'girl', 'being', 'shot', 'attack', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'spite', 'father', 'concerns', 'situation', 'Later', 'family', 'many', 'other', 'Jewish', 'residents', 'country', 'flee', 'fairly', 'low-key', 'film', 'reasonably', 'good', 'acting', ""n't"", 'effects-laden', 'war', 'movie', 'rather', 'thoughtful', 'rendition', 'lesser-known', 'WWII', 'story']",A Day in October

After about three years of believing they could live in peace with the Germans, the Jews were finally scheduled to be shipped to the death camps.  Fortunately, a trusted Dane working in the German's Command learned of the plan a day or two before it was to happen, so he secretly warned the Jews.  Within a matter of hours, the Danish Resistance help get some 7,200 Jews on boats and taken to Sweden.  Being neutral, Sweden willingly took in these Jewish refugees.  Fewer than four hundred did not escape, but were shipped out of Denmark to the camps.  This is the compelling, true story of one family in that 'miracle at midnight.'  The Disney movie of that name is a similar story, which chronicles another family experience during that same incident.There is so much to discuss in this movie that parents will just want to watch it with their kids to decide what would be important to their family.  There is very little bad language, or anything objectionable to traditional values families in this movie.  It is one you will not soon forget.

I like films about WWII; I like DB Sweeny; and the plight of Danish Jews sounded compelling. But the film is a 'dud' and sad to say in particular because DB Sweeny just isn't very good here.The story of the Danish Jews escaping to Sweden just before they were to be sent to concentration camps by the Nazi's, should hold anyone's interest, but the effort by the filmaker to make an engaging movie just falls flat.

988578,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000FDFSYA,Z Hayes,"[8, 8]","This movie tells the story of Danish resistance against the Nazis during WW II and centers around a Jewish family who find themselves having to harbor a Danish resistance member who is severely wounded during an attack on the Nazis. D.B. Sweeney plays Niels Jensen, a member of the Danish resistance who is given refuge by Sara Kublitz [Kelly Wolf] and her parents, Emma and Solomon [Tovah Feldshuh and Daniel Benzali]. Initially Sara's father, Solomon is upset and angry that they are forced to harbor Niels as he feels that the Nazis have left the Jews alone for the most part and they should not be antagonised. But he eventually realises that the Jews are in mortal danger and aids Niels and the Resistance in sabotaging one of the factories producing rocket parts for the Nazis. By this time, a romance develops between Niels and Sara and they are determined to stay together despite the odds.When the Jews are told by an informant that the Nazis are going to arrest all Jews and deport them [almost certainly to the death camps in Europe], the Danish Resistance helps the Jews of Denmark escape the Nazis in one of the most heroic rescue efforts of WW II.All in all, about 7,200 Danish Jews were safely transported to Sweden, a neutral country. Only about 400 Danish Jews were caught in the Nazi death net. The heroism of the Danish Resistance is something we can all learn from, and it's not just the members of the resistance - ordinary Danish civilians aided their Jewish friends and neighbors because they felt it was the right thing to do - the Jews were considered by the Danes to be Danish citizens just like them, and thus were entitled to the same freedoms and rights they were. I read in a book that the Danes not only helped the Danish Jews escape but also maintained properties belonging to the Jews to be reclaimed by them after the war - such a contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe.I'd recommend this movie for all those who are interested in WW II/Holocaust dramas. Another movie I'd recommend that also focuses on the rescue of the Danish Jews is Miracle at Midnight, starring Sam Waterston.",5,The heroic rescue of Danish Jews during WW II,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2122,"['movie', 'story', 'Danish', 'resistance', 'Nazis', 'WW', 'II', 'centers', 'Jewish', 'family', 'who', 'find', 'having', 'harbor', 'Danish', 'resistance', 'member', 'who', 'severely', 'wounded', 'attack', 'Nazis', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'Niels', 'Jensen', 'member', 'Danish', 'resistance', 'who', 'given', 'refuge', 'Sara', 'Kublitz', '[', 'Kelly', 'Wolf', ']', 'parents', 'Emma', 'Solomon', '[', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'Daniel', 'Benzali', ']', 'Initially', 'Sara', 'father', 'Solomon', 'upset', 'angry', 'are', 'forced', 'harbor', 'Niels', 'Nazis', 'have', 'left', 'Jews', 'alone', 'most', 'part', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'antagonised', 'eventually', 'Jews', 'are', 'mortal', 'danger', 'aids', 'Niels', 'Resistance', 'sabotaging', 'one', 'factories', 'producing', 'rocket', 'parts', 'Nazis', 'time', 'romance', 'Niels', 'Sara', 'are', 'determined', 'stay', 'together', 'odds.When', 'Jews', 'are', 'told', 'informant', 'Nazis', 'are', 'going', 'arrest', 'Jews', 'deport', 'almost', 'certainly', 'death', 'camps', 'Europe', ']', 'Danish', 'Resistance', 'Jews', 'Denmark', 'escape', 'Nazis', 'one', 'most', 'heroic', 'rescue', 'efforts', 'WW', 'II.All', '7,200', 'Danish', 'Jews', 'were', 'safely', 'transported', 'Sweden', 'neutral', 'country', 'Only', '400', 'Danish', 'Jews', 'were', 'caught', 'Nazi', 'death', 'net', 'heroism', 'Danish', 'Resistance', 'something', 'can', 'learn', 'not', 'just', 'members', 'resistance', 'ordinary', 'Danish', 'civilians', 'aided', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'felt', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Jews', 'were', 'considered', 'Danes', 'be', 'Danish', 'citizens', 'just', 'thus', 'were', 'entitled', 'same', 'freedoms', 'rights', 'were', 'read', 'book', 'Danes', 'not', 'only', 'helped', 'Danish', 'Jews', 'escape', 'also', 'maintained', 'properties', 'belonging', 'Jews', 'be', 'reclaimed', 'war', 'contrast', 'what', 'happened', 'elsewhere', 'Europe.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'WW', 'II/Holocaust', 'dramas', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'also', 'rescue', 'Danish', 'Jews', 'Miracle', 'Midnight', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Waterston']",A Day in October
