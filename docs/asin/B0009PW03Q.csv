Michael & Me is not so much a critique of Moore's oeuvre as it is an analysis and repudiation of the prevarications he publicized in Bowling for Columbine. Further, it attacks the prohibition of firearms more than it does the director himself. Such an approach is badly needed and, despite's its low budget feel, these frames tell us far more about guns and the human psyche than anything Michael Moore has ever produced. Some of the interviews (of people on the street in particular) were absolutely hysterical. The girl who believed that she did not need a gun to defend herself against home intruders because she felt her confident demeanor would frighten them off was tragic but one you'll not soon forget. Volokh's mentioning of the way some people want to do policy by wishful thinking was right on the money. Overall, the experts here are outstanding. The Joyce Malcolm segment was brief but a highlight I'd say. She shared the story of Tony Martin who got life imprisonment in England for shooting two burglars who broke into his home.

910764,A1M5405JH9THP9,B0009PW03Q,golgotha.gov,"[0, 0]","MICHAEL & ME (2004)directed by LARRY ELDERapprox. 90 minutesLarry Elder has a number of accomplishments to his name.  The two most famous are probably 'The Ten Things You Can't Say In America' and his radio program ""The Larry Elder Show"".  He was also the TV judge on 'Moral Court'.  Here he takes a stab at filmmaking with mostly positive results.Guns are something that America has a hard time really talking about without getting too emotional.  This is true of both supporters and critics of the 2nd Amendment.  This movie is from a pro-gun position and almost every person interviewed is pro-gun as well.You will hear tales of gun control gone bonkers.  For example, the story of a UK man who was robbed six times finally decided he needed to protect himself.  When he was robbed for the seventh time, he shot the criminals, killing one and wounding the other.  The criminal who lived got three years in jail but the home owner got life in prison AND is being sued by his assailant!  This is because self defense with a firearm is not considered a right in the UK.  On the issue of ""waiting periods"", ""Jane Doe"" explains that when she attempted to purchase a gun she was told she'd have to wait 10 days.  Sadly she was raped and beaten two days later at her workplace.  You will also hear Suzanna Gratia-Hupp recount the horrible 1991 incident that occurred at Luby's restaurant in Killeen, Texas.  A man drove his truck through the window and opened fire on people inside.  Hupp saw her father murdered before her eyes in a tragedy that left 23 dead.  Although she owned a gun at the time, she wouldn't have been legally allowed to have it inside the Luby's at the time of the incident.  She went onto be elected into the Texas Legislature and defend concealed carry permits for guns.Another area that is covered is how gun control effects poor people and the black community.  Former crip gang members are interviewed were they say that gun control has never prevented them from obtaining semi-automatic weapons.  The legislative hysteria over ""Saturday Night Specials"" (formerly inexpensive hanguns) deprives poor people who live in high-crime areas from defending themselves.Now for some of my criticisms.  Larry Elder tries to beat Moore at his own game by ""debating"" him in cartoon form.  This was done to add humor to the film, and because Mr. Moore did not return his calls to do a real debate.  The problem is, it isn't funny enough to serve its purpose and ends up looking infantile.  He also brings up issues that have nothing to do with guns such as the Iraq War.  With statistics on your side, why take the low road?  Also, the section about celebrities was totally pointless and seemed like a last minute addition.  In general I think Moore figures too prominently in this movie (i.e. the title) and while he is a favorite target of conservatives, the segments involving him are more distracting than anything else.  The movie isn't about Michael Moore or even 'Bowling for Columbine', its about guns in the United States.  Moore is small potatoes compared to an inalienable  right.Here is a partial list of other people appearing in this movie:Kenneth Blanchard, author of 'Black Man With A Gun'Robert Cottrol, author of 'Gun Control and the Constitution'Bernard Goldberg, author of 'BIAS'Stephen Halbrook, author of 'That Every Man Be Armed'Gary Kleck, author of 'Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America'David B.

910770,A14X8PU4E3APFE,B0009PW03Q,Mother Hen,"[73, 85]","Larry Elder gathers input from an impressive collection of historians, lawyers, criminologists, and scholars on the role of guns in America, including comparisons of other nations' relationships with guns and gun control.  In addition to the erudite speakers interviewed by Elder, there were numerous man-on-the-street interviews which reflected the knowledge, ignorance, and opinions of Americans about gun rights.  Also fascinating were the insights of reformed gang leaders and their anecdotal experiences and views on guns and crime.The American public ranges from ignorant to sharply astute in their understanding of our Constitution, our nation's gun laws, and gun statistics.  Elder dispels misunderstandings, clarifies realities, and reveals the plain-spoken truth of guns.  The result shows guns to be tools (dangerous in the hands of criminals and life-saving in the hands of those who would deter them); shows that these tools are used far more to protect than to harm; explains that even if you could undo the 2nd Amendment and remove guns from the law-abiding, you'd still have a thriving black-market abundantly providing them to the lawless; and unambiguously explains that, love them or hate them, it is our Constitutional right to own guns.I confess a bias in reviewing this documentary:  I came into the 1990's a gun-hater, but found my opinions irrevocably altered over the course of that decade by exactly the kind of hard facts compiled and introduced here by Larry Elder.  So be warned, those of you who think you are faithfully married to the ideals of gun control:  this movie can alter your thinking, it can lead to the kind of knowledge and understanding that, once achieved, can never be undone.My one beef with this documentary is the title, which I thought was slightly misleading.  I had hoped for a greater confrontation between Elder & Michael Moore, though in all fairness, it's been so long since I saw ""Roger & Me"" that I don't remember whether Moore succeeded in any better of a showdown between himself and Roger Smith in that movie.  Fortunately for America, Larry Elder never had to ambush Alzheimer's patients to score pathetic points against his opposition, as Michael Moore did in ""Bowling for Columbine"".  I guess you really don't need to rely on propaganda and ambushing the disabled when you have facts & history on your side.",5,"A thoughtful, comprehensive overview to the 2nd Amendment debate.",1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,2371,"['Larry', 'Elder', 'gathers', 'input', 'impressive', 'collection', 'historians', 'lawyers', 'criminologists', 'scholars', 'role', 'guns', 'America', 'including', 'comparisons', 'other', 'nations', 'relationships', 'guns', 'gun', 'control', 'addition', 'erudite', 'speakers', 'interviewed', 'Elder', 'were', 'numerous', 'man-on-the-street', 'interviews', 'reflected', 'knowledge', 'ignorance', 'opinions', 'Americans', 'gun', 'rights', 'Also', 'fascinating', 'were', 'insights', 'reformed', 'gang', 'leaders', 'anecdotal', 'experiences', 'views', 'guns', 'crime.The', 'American', 'public', 'ranges', 'ignorant', 'sharply', 'astute', 'understanding', 'Constitution', 'nation', 'gun', 'laws', 'gun', 'statistics', 'Elder', 'dispels', 'misunderstandings', 'clarifies', 'realities', 'plain-spoken', 'truth', 'guns', 'result', 'guns', 'be', 'tools', 'dangerous', 'hands', 'criminals', 'life-saving', 'hands', 'who', 'would', 'deter', 'tools', 'are', 'used', 'far', 'more', 'protect', 'harm', 'even', 'could', 'undo', '2nd', 'Amendment', 'remove', 'guns', 'law-abiding', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'thriving', 'black-market', 'abundantly', 'providing', 'lawless', 'unambiguously', 'love', 'hate', 'Constitutional', 'right', 'own', 'guns.I', 'confess', 'bias', 'reviewing', 'documentary', 'came', '1990', 'gun-hater', 'found', 'opinions', 'irrevocably', 'altered', 'course', 'decade', 'exactly', 'kind', 'hard', 'facts', 'compiled', 'introduced', 'here', 'Larry', 'Elder', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'faithfully', 'married', 'ideals', 'gun', 'control', 'movie', 'can', 'alter', 'thinking', 'can', 'lead', 'kind', 'knowledge', 'understanding', 'once', 'achieved', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'undone.My', 'one', 'beef', 'documentary', 'title', 'thought', 'was', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'had', 'hoped', 'greater', 'confrontation', 'Elder', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fairness', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'saw', 'Roger', 'Me', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Moore', 'succeeded', 'better', 'showdown', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'America', 'Larry', 'Elder', 'never', 'had', 'ambush', 'Alzheimer', 'patients', 'score', 'pathetic', 'points', 'opposition', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'did', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'guess', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'rely', 'propaganda', 'ambushing', 'disabled', 'when', 'have', 'facts', 'history', 'side']",Michael & Me

In the end, it is just as loaded and biased as the filmmaker alluded to in the title.  It is a response to ""Bowling for Columbine"" that feels more like damage control.  It is permeated by the stench of the same old argument, ""guns don't kill people, people do.""  Well, they sure do make it easier, don't they! The director of this documentary has a very obvious agenda.  After the shooting at Virginia Tech, and with all the violence in our society, it is really irresponsible not to at leat ponder the idea of some sort of restricitons on gun ownership.
