Originally released in '91, this movie is one of the best drama, horror, comedy, action, romance movies of all time. If you can find one, buy it.

313786,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,6302462142,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Another great movie recently shown on MyNetworkTV that I had the pleasure of viewing and I absolutely loved it!Charlie Sykes and his beautiful girlfriend, Rachel Clark are planning on running away to get married on Las Vegas. They take an abandoned backroad to Vegas, ignoring the warning of a gas station attendant named Sam, who recommended them to take the highway. Shortly after, they're pulled over by a demon cop who has a bald head, wears shades, has symbols carved in his face, and has a pentagram as a badge. He's simply known as, Hell Cop. Hell Cop attacks Charlie and kidnaps his girlfriend and drives off with her in the back of his police car.Charlies goes back to Sam, who explains to Charlie who---or what Hell Cop is and that he'll have to enter Hell to get her back. Charlie is given a shotgun with ammo and a car that has a special attribute. Charlie discovers that Satan had Rachel kidnapped because she's a virgin and plans on making her his bride. Once Charlie enters Hell, he'll have 24 hours to find Rachel and escape the depths of the underworld, or she will be Satan's property forever and he'll be stuck in Hell for eternity.Once in Hell, Charlie confronts Hell Cop on numerous occasions but gets his car wrecked and is fatally shot during some of those confrontations. It's then when he goes to a mechanic named Beezle, who not only fixes his car but brings him back to life following Hell Cop's fatal gunshot. Beezle informs Charlie that Hell Cop is taking Rachel to Hell City to marry The Devil and gives Charlie instructions on how to get to Hell City and save Rachel from becoming the bride of Satan.From there on out, Charlie is in a race against time to save Rachel from the evil clutches of the horned one and free her from the depths of hell before it's too late. Can he do it? Will he save Rachel in time or will time run out and spend an eternity in hell?This is a really awesome comedy horror movie that's obviously not meant to be taken seriously. It has an enjoyable plot that will make you laugh quite a few times throughout. The makeup job for Hell Cop is tremendous though as I got chills the first time I got a look at him. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to see this movie as part of MyNetworkTV's This, as this has now become a must-have movie for me to add to my retro movie vault!",5,Awesomely Hilarious Comedy Horror Film,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,2330,"['great', 'movie', 'recently', 'shown', 'MyNetworkTV', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Charlie', 'Sykes', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Clark', 'are', 'planning', 'running', 'away', 'get', 'married', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'take', 'abandoned', 'backroad', 'Vegas', 'ignoring', 'warning', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'named', 'Sam', 'who', 'recommended', 'take', 'highway', 'Shortly', ""'re"", 'pulled', 'over', 'demon', 'cop', 'who', 'bald', 'head', 'shades', 'symbols', 'carved', 'face', 'pentagram', 'badge', 'simply', 'known', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'attacks', 'Charlie', 'kidnaps', 'girlfriend', 'off', 'back', 'police', 'car.Charlies', 'back', 'Sam', 'who', 'Charlie', 'who', '-or', 'what', 'Hell', 'Cop', ""'ll"", 'have', 'enter', 'Hell', 'get', 'back', 'Charlie', 'given', 'shotgun', 'ammo', 'car', 'special', 'attribute', 'Charlie', 'Satan', 'had', 'Rachel', 'kidnapped', 'virgin', 'plans', 'making', 'bride', 'Once', 'Charlie', 'enters', 'Hell', ""'ll"", 'have', '24', 'hours', 'find', 'Rachel', 'escape', 'depths', 'underworld', 'will', 'be', 'Satan', 'property', 'forever', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stuck', 'Hell', 'eternity.Once', 'Hell', 'Charlie', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'car', 'wrecked', 'fatally', 'shot', 'confrontations', 'then', 'when', 'mechanic', 'named', 'Beezle', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'fixes', 'car', 'back', 'life', 'following', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'fatal', 'gunshot', 'Beezle', 'Charlie', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'taking', 'Rachel', 'Hell', 'City', 'marry', 'Devil', 'Charlie', 'instructions', 'how', 'get', 'Hell', 'City', 'save', 'Rachel', 'becoming', 'bride', 'Satan.From', 'out', 'Charlie', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'Rachel', 'evil', 'clutches', 'horned', 'one', 'free', 'her', 'depths', 'hell', 'too', 'late', 'Can', 'do', 'Will', 'save', 'Rachel', 'time', 'will', 'time', 'run', 'out', 'spend', 'eternity', 'hell', 'really', 'awesome', 'comedy', 'horror', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'enjoyable', 'plot', 'will', 'make', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'makeup', 'job', 'Hell', 'Cop', 'tremendous', 'got', 'chills', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'look', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'movie', 'part', 'MyNetworkTV', 'now', 'become', 'must-have', 'movie', 'add', 'retro', 'movie', 'vault']",Highway to Hell VHS
