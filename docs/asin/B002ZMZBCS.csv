1314402,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B002ZMZBCS,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[7, 7]","""Mr. Right"" does a slight genuflect in the direction of the 1950s classic, ""La Ronde"", but is otherwise a well-written and decently acted romantic comedy with a gay core.  Credible casting with attractive and solidly professional actors (mostly) and good production values make the film engaging and way above average overall for the genre.Basically the story of several gay couples and their female friend in common, ""Mr. Right"" focuses on what draws people together and, conversely, what works to drive them apart.  The story's greatest strength is in its portrayal of the characters and how they evolve as individuals when they enter into relationships.  It often breaks down to the pairing of the relatively mature and secure with the relatively immature and insecure.  Without going very far into detail, in this flick (British, by the way), you have a successful and wealthy artist paired with a hunky and calculating drone; an aspiring but talentless younger actor with a successful but restless TV producer; a well-meaning but nervous single father with a rising soap opera actor; and female friend with ""eHarmony""-matched jock.""Mr. Right"" has plenty of good moments and several non-cliched endings that make it well-worth watching.

1314404,A1E481YU3ZPK6S,B002ZMZBCS,Elisa,"[0, 0]","I don't know if it was a conscious decision of the production, or not, but this movie was presented like a straight comedy about an het couple, Louise and Paul, who is struggling with a newborn relationship, and the fear of Louise to have found once more a gay in the closet as boyfriend. But since the first scenes, Louise and Paul go in the background and the story is really about two gay couple, William and Lawrence, at the beginning of their relationship and with the need to find a balance, and Harry and Alex, who instead are already in a long term relationship, that basically is good, but since they are not content with their life outside their relationship, obviously also their private life is on the risk.Said that, this is really a nice comedy, with a bit of drama, but after all not so much to kill the romance. The actors are handsome enough without being out of the ordinary, and their stories are common but with a bit of ""chic"" (artistry type, nice enough houses, night clubs and so on).Mr. Right is a low budget but good romance, and the actors are all very good: in the end, it's the straight couple, the one who is more advertized, that is the less interesting.",5,Mr. Right (2009),1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1184,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'conscious', 'decision', 'production', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'presented', 'straight', 'comedy', 'het', 'couple', 'Louise', 'Paul', 'who', 'struggling', 'newborn', 'relationship', 'fear', 'Louise', 'have', 'found', 'once', 'more', 'gay', 'closet', 'boyfriend', 'first', 'scenes', 'Louise', 'Paul', 'go', 'background', 'story', 'really', 'about', 'two', 'gay', 'couple', 'William', 'Lawrence', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'need', 'find', 'balance', 'Harry', 'Alex', 'who', 'instead', 'are', 'already', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'basically', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'content', 'life', 'relationship', 'obviously', 'also', 'private', 'life', 'risk.Said', 'really', 'nice', 'comedy', 'bit', 'drama', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'kill', 'romance', 'actors', 'are', 'handsome', 'enough', 'being', 'ordinary', 'stories', 'are', 'common', 'bit', 'chic', 'artistry', 'type', 'nice', 'enough', 'houses', 'night', 'clubs', 'so', '.Mr', 'Right', 'low', 'budget', 'good', 'romance', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'end', 'straight', 'couple', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'advertized', 'less', 'interesting']",Mr Right
1314405,A24BEMERMTXJRY,B002ZMZBCS,Ford Ka,"[1, 1]","The idea of showing concurrently the lives of several characters which are more or less connected with each other is as old in gay and lesbian cinema as anywhere else. Unfortunately, usually it is done better as ""Goldfish Memory"" or ""Love and Other Disasters"" amply prove. ""Mr Right"", although not necessarily an indy movie (some actors are actually recognizable, at least for the British audience) seems to be the work of a rather indy-minded screenplay writer.""Mr Right"" aims at presenting a variety of ways in which gay (and sometimes straight) people are looking for their perfect companions in contemporary London. This is a good place to start and the movie takes off nicely and then... it gets stuck. The story-lines do not complement each other in a very meaningful way, the characters are not necessarily very interesting, and their life choices sometimes require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be accepted. The ending seems quite forced and not fully credible, I am not quite sure whether it will come up to most people's idea of happy ending.Having said that I must say there are good parts to the movie - I found especially touching the story line of an art dealer who has to find a way to make his young daughter accept a candidate for her daddy's significant other. But it is a well known truth that kids always steal the show ;)In short - it may not be necessary the right movie for you but spending an evening with Mr Right is not the worst option. Just don't look for a deep and meaningful structure, it's more like a handful of scenes and story-lines from which you must choose what interest and touches you and discreetly disregard the rest.",4,Mr Right in London,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,1665,"['idea', 'showing', 'concurrently', 'lives', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'connected', 'other', 'old', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'cinema', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'usually', 'done', 'better', 'Goldfish', 'Memory', 'Love', 'Other', 'Disasters', 'amply', 'prove', 'Mr', 'Right', 'not', 'necessarily', 'indy', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'recognizable', 'least', 'British', 'audience', 'be', 'work', 'rather', 'indy-minded', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Mr', 'Right', 'presenting', 'variety', 'ways', 'gay', 'sometimes', 'straight', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'perfect', 'companions', 'contemporary', 'London', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'movie', 'nicely', 'then', 'stuck', 'story-lines', 'do', 'not', 'complement', 'other', 'very', 'meaningful', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'very', 'interesting', 'life', 'choices', 'sometimes', 'require', 'lot', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'be', 'accepted', 'ending', 'quite', 'forced', 'not', 'fully', 'credible', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'people', 'idea', 'happy', 'ending.Having', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'are', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'found', 'especially', 'touching', 'story', 'line', 'art', 'dealer', 'who', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'young', 'daughter', 'accept', 'candidate', 'daddy', 'significant', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'truth', 'kids', 'always', 'steal', 'show', 'short', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'necessary', 'right', 'movie', 'spending', 'evening', 'Mr', 'Right', 'not', 'worst', 'option', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'structure', 'more', 'handful', 'scenes', 'story-lines', 'must', 'choose', 'what', 'interest', 'touches', 'discreetly', 'disregard', 'rest']",Mr Right

1314409,AMWIK6JOWNTHK,B002ZMZBCS,Kurt Clare,"[1, 1]","I was somewhat disappointed by this film, not because of the acting, quality or production, but rather the scripting. The film in essence follows the lives of a group of gay friends and their respective lovers, attempting where possible to address their failings, desires and personal demons. This is done verbally as opposed to visually, and as a consequence a great deal of effort is spent on the characters and their communications.Through a series of lengthy monologues and verbalised thoughts, the central characters discuss their emotions, lack of direction and obsessions. The tragedy is that whilst many a man may think intensely on aspects of his life, he seldom verbalises those thoughts in a manner which amounts to a confusing litany of expressions that have neither direction nor purpose. Nor is it conceivable that a person would speak out loud in such a way as to ignore the presence of others, merely to verbalise what he or she is thinking. At times these verbalised thought processes are confusing, and it takes great effort to stay focused. After some time you wonder whether there was any point to what was said, and your impression is that the character is overwhelmed by his own neurosis. The net effect is that many of the characters are nothing more than self-obsessed thinkers, concerned more with their own thoughts than the opinions of others. Their lovers are casual (and often disinterested) observers who like the audience are forced to listen to these lengthy emotional explanations, without having any opportunity to participate therein.Ironically one of the features of the DVD are two short stories, which are introduced by the writer David Morris. If you watch the introduction you will understand the scripting, as he himself seems to say a great deal in that introduction, often repeating himself. I ended up fast forwarding to the actual short films, only to find both of them much the same as the film. That is, single characters discussing their emotions, thought process and beliefs ad nauseam.In all fairness however, there are some good moments in the film, and I commend the direction (also David Morris) as this must have been difficult. It is not easy to portray conversations in film, and they are better suited to the theatre (where the audience expects to participate in the characters thought processes). As a film however, I am not sure it succeeds.",3,A little neurotic!,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,2400,"['was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'film', 'not', 'acting', 'quality', 'production', 'rather', 'scripting', 'film', 'essence', 'lives', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'respective', 'lovers', 'attempting', 'where', 'possible', 'address', 'failings', 'desires', 'personal', 'demons', 'done', 'verbally', 'opposed', 'visually', 'consequence', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'spent', 'characters', 'communications.Through', 'series', 'lengthy', 'monologues', 'verbalised', 'thoughts', 'central', 'characters', 'discuss', 'emotions', 'lack', 'direction', 'obsessions', 'tragedy', 'whilst', 'many', 'man', 'may', 'think', 'intensely', 'aspects', 'life', 'seldom', 'thoughts', 'manner', 'confusing', 'litany', 'expressions', 'have', 'direction', 'purpose', 'conceivable', 'person', 'would', 'speak', 'out', 'loud', 'such', 'way', 'ignore', 'presence', 'others', 'merely', 'verbalise', 'what', 'thinking', 'times', 'verbalised', 'thought', 'processes', 'are', 'confusing', 'great', 'effort', 'stay', 'focused', 'time', 'wonder', 'was', 'point', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'impression', 'character', 'overwhelmed', 'own', 'neurosis', 'net', 'effect', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'self-obsessed', 'thinkers', 'concerned', 'more', 'own', 'thoughts', 'opinions', 'others', 'lovers', 'are', 'casual', 'often', 'disinterested', 'observers', 'who', 'audience', 'are', 'forced', 'listen', 'lengthy', 'emotional', 'explanations', 'having', 'opportunity', 'participate', 'therein.Ironically', 'one', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'are', 'introduced', 'writer', 'David', 'Morris', 'watch', 'introduction', 'will', 'understand', 'scripting', 'say', 'great', 'deal', 'introduction', 'often', 'repeating', 'ended', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'actual', 'short', 'films', 'only', 'find', 'much', 'same', 'film', 'single', 'characters', 'discussing', 'emotions', 'thought', 'process', 'beliefs', 'ad', 'fairness', 'however', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'film', 'commend', 'direction', 'also', 'David', 'Morris', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'not', 'easy', 'portray', 'conversations', 'film', 'are', 'better', 'suited', 'theatre', 'where', 'audience', 'participate', 'characters', 'thought', 'processes', 'film', 'however', 'am', 'not', 'sure']",Mr Right
