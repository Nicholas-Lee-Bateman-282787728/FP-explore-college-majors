These are definitely the kind of movies you never get tired of seeing, I've seen both of them enough to know. It's unusual for a sequel to be as good as the original but in my opinion European Vacation is just as good as Family Vacation, in some ways maybe better. These films don't try to be something they're not. They are just plain and simple laugh out loud funny. When you have all the jokes and gags memorized and they can still make you laugh, that's really saying something. There are also some great commentaries included featuring Chevy Chase.Jennifer K.
