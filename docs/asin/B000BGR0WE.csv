941954,AALKQQ5PEZ9EJ,B000BGR0WE,K-Fleet,"[3, 6]","The lead character (killer) is a blatant rip off of Micheal Myers, from the mask and clothing, to the knife, to his demeanor.  There was very little I enjoyed about this movie, other than comparing it to others because of the obvious similarities.  You even find out who the killer is before he's unmasked.  I've seen more mystery in a Scooby Doo episode.  If you're a fan of B-movies that are A-movie rip-offs, then this one's for you.  If not, don't waste your time.",2,Michael Myers revisited?,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,468,"['lead', 'character', 'killer', 'blatant', 'rip', 'Micheal', 'Myers', 'mask', 'clothing', 'knife', 'demeanor', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'other', 'comparing', 'others', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'unmasked', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'mystery', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'episode', ""'re"", 'fan', 'B-movies', 'are', 'A-movie', 'rip-offs', 'then', 'one', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",The Path of Evil
941955,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000BGR0WE,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","I didn't realize this is a sequel to a film called HARVEST OF FEAR, so I can't tell if this one is better or worse.  On its own merits, despite a kinship to HALLOWEEN, it's an okay slasher film, although it's tagged on ending is illogical and unnecessary.  Anyway, it's about a town called Devil's Lake, which is in Oregon, and twenty years earlier, a series of murders was committed but the killer never identified.  Now in 2004, the supposed killer has been apprehended after a similar crime scene, but this killer says he was framed.  The deputy who caught the killer is now off the force due to injuries and psychological/drinking problems.  Seems like his parents were two of the victims back in 1984 and he's having nightmares about it; his girlfriend has also left him for the new young medical examiner.  But even though the killer is in prison, the murders start again--so who is the killer?  The script tries to steer you away but it's fairly obvious, even with its last minute twist.  The acting is average with no real standouts.  It's all been done before but this one isn't as bad as it could have been.",3,THE OFT BEATEN PATH,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1117,"['did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'sequel', 'film', 'called', 'HARVEST', 'FEAR', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'one', 'better', 'worse', 'own', 'merits', 'kinship', 'HALLOWEEN', 'okay', 'slasher', 'film', 'tagged', 'ending', 'illogical', 'unnecessary', 'Anyway', 'town', 'called', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'Oregon', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'series', 'murders', 'was', 'committed', 'killer', 'never', 'identified', 'Now', '2004', 'supposed', 'killer', 'been', 'apprehended', 'similar', 'crime', 'scene', 'killer', 'was', 'framed', 'deputy', 'who', 'caught', 'killer', 'now', 'force', 'due', 'injuries', 'psychological/drinking', 'problems', 'parents', 'were', 'two', 'victims', 'back', '1984', 'having', 'nightmares', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'left', 'new', 'young', 'medical', 'examiner', 'even', 'killer', 'prison', 'murders', 'start', 'again', 'who', 'killer', 'script', 'steer', 'away', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'even', 'last', 'minute', 'twist', 'acting', 'average', 'real', 'standouts', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been']",The Path of Evil

The makers of this movie are dreaming if they think they can come anywhere close to Halloween or Michael Myers!!!! A killing spree began years ago in Devil's Lake. The killings were never solved. Many years later, a local deputy who's parents were among the victims of the killer is investigating a new series of murders that are very similiar to the ones years earlier.  Overall, not a great movie. I'd suggest watching it only if you are bored out of your mind!!",2,Wanna Be Movie.....,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,541,"['Ok', 'slasher', 'type', 'movie', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Myer', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'makers', 'movie', 'are', 'dreaming', 'think', 'can', 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', 'Halloween', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'killing', 'spree', 'began', 'years', 'ago', 'Devil', 'Lake', 'killings', 'were', 'never', 'solved', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'local', 'deputy', 'who', 'parents', 'were', 'victims', 'killer', 'investigating', 'new', 'series', 'murders', 'are', 'very', 'similiar', 'ones', 'years', 'earlier', 'Overall', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'only', 'are', 'bored', 'mind']",The Path of Evil
