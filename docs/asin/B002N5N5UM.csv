I heard this just came out recently and it looked funny. Boy was I wrong. I was watching this with a friend and after 10 mins I said to him, ""wow, this movie is pretty terrible so far huh?"" He agreed. It unfortunately did not get any better.If you explain the general plot, then hear about the actors in it, you assume this movie would be average at WORST. Jeremy Piven playing a used car salesman - this script should write itself. The problem is they try to hit you over the head with every single joke, and in all honesty, most of them aren't funny. There's a few that make you chuckle, but most are just thrown in out of nowhere. All of the sudden someone is yelling and swearing for no reason, and it just didn't make me laugh at all. This is coming from someone who likes stupid comedies. Anchorman is completely stupid, but it's hysterical and well written. This movie is so poorly executed, it's absolutely painful to watch. It makes ""Step-Brothers"" look like a golden globe winner. I wish I would have spent the hour and half cleaning my room.I recommend saving your money and waiting for ""The Hangover"" to come out in a few weeks.",1,Really Terrible...especially considering the solid cast,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,1234,"['Had', 'day', 'thanksgiving', 'off', 'figured', 'perfect', 'hang', 'watch', 'movie', 'day', 'heard', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'recently', 'looked', 'funny', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'watching', 'friend', '10', 'mins', 'said', 'wow', 'movie', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'so', 'far', 'huh', 'agreed', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'better.If', 'explain', 'general', 'plot', 'then', 'hear', 'actors', 'assume', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'average', 'WORST', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'playing', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'script', 'should', 'write', 'problem', 'try', 'hit', 'head', 'single', 'joke', 'honesty', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'few', 'make', 'chuckle', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'nowhere', 'sudden', 'someone', 'yelling', 'swearing', 'reason', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'laugh', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'stupid', 'comedies', 'Anchorman', 'completely', 'stupid', 'hysterical', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'absolutely', 'painful', 'watch', 'Step-Brothers', 'look', 'golden', 'globe', 'winner', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'hour', 'half', 'cleaning', 'room.I', 'recommend', 'saving', 'money', 'waiting', 'Hangover', 'come', 'out', 'few', 'weeks']","The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"
1279529,A35AFXBYZ4WK2O,B002N5N5UM,C. D. White,"[6, 12]","From the cast this movie looks like it will be good. Watching the trailers would further enforce this illusion. Unfortunately, this is not the case. As much as I like Ed Helms, Ken Jeong, David Koechner etc. this movie produces more groans than laughs. When the antagonist (Ed Helms) is more appealing than the protagonist (Jeremy Piven), then clearly the writing has to be pointed at as to why this movie fails to achieve it's intended affect (which is meager at that, to make you laugh). Also, the fact that there are no extras on the DVD should clue you in to how everyone involved with this stinker would rather forget this movie than remember it.There are some laughs in the movie, Ed Helms is a bright spot, Will Ferrell's cameo is memorable, and there are some hilarious politically incorrect lines that Charles Napier's character (Dick Lewiston) delivers but the main flaw in this movie stems from the fact that I didn't want to root for Don Ready (Jeremy Piven) and his team of mercenary  auto sellers. I found them repulsive and with NO redeemable qualities. That would be fine if this was an edgy drama. But this film aims to be a fun comedy.The handful of good performaces by the aforementioned solid cast save this from being a total waste of time but, not so much that you don't realize you've been sold a lemon by a sleazy used car salesman at the end of the movie.",2,A Prime Example Of How Important Writing Is To A Movie,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1380,"['cast', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'Watching', 'trailers', 'would', 'further', 'enforce', 'illusion', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'David', 'Koechner', 'etc', 'movie', 'more', 'groans', 'laughs', 'When', 'antagonist', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'more', 'appealing', 'protagonist', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'then', 'clearly', 'writing', 'be', 'pointed', 'why', 'movie', 'achieve', 'intended', 'affect', 'meager', 'make', 'laugh', 'Also', 'fact', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'should', 'clue', 'how', 'everyone', 'involved', 'stinker', 'would', 'rather', 'forget', 'movie', 'remember', 'are', 'laughs', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'bright', 'spot', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'cameo', 'memorable', 'are', 'hilarious', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'lines', 'Charles', 'Napier', 'character', 'Dick', 'Lewiston', 'delivers', 'main', 'flaw', 'movie', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'root', 'Don', 'Ready', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'team', 'mercenary', 'auto', 'sellers', 'found', 'repulsive', 'NO', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'was', 'edgy', 'drama', 'film', 'be', 'fun', 'comedy.The', 'handful', 'good', 'performaces', 'aforementioned', 'solid', 'cast', 'save', 'being', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sold', 'lemon', 'sleazy', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'end', 'movie']","The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"

1279532,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002N5N5UM,Craig Whittle,"[2, 4]","THE GOODS: LIVE HARD, SELL HARDSTARRING: Jeremy Piven, Ving Rhames, James Brolin, David Koechner, Kathryn Hahn, Ed Helms, Jordana Spiro, Craig Robinson, Tony Hale, Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle, Charles Napier, Jonathan Sadowski, Noureen DeWulf, Wendie Malick, Gina Gershon and Alan ThickeWRITTEN BY: Andy Stock andRick StempsonDIRECTED BY: Neal BrennanRated: RGenre: ComedyRelease Date: 14 August 2009I have been a huge fan of Jeremy Piven ever since the first time I saw him on an episode of Ellen. The man is hilarious and he's very talented. I was shocked when he did not receive an Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance in 2006's Somkin' Aces.At least he's back in another starring role as Don Ready, in the very hysterical The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard. I recently had someone tell me that Piven's portrayal of Don Ready, reminded them of ""his character Ari Gold from Entourage; only sleazier and with less money!"" Entourage being my absolute favorite show, I couldn't agree more.His character in this film, Don Ready, is the ultimate used car salesman. His business card, says it all: ""Don Ready: I move cars, Mother F***er!"" You could say he lives, only to sell cars. It's his darkest passion and the only thing he has going for him. He lives his life on the road; traveling from dying dealership to dying dealership, with his mission being to restore order and keep the place on its feet. As depressing as this life may sound, he is more than content with it. Or is he?When Ben Selleck's (James Brolin) beloved dealership meets the head of its demise, he gives Don Ready a call. Don and his crew come a running.His teammates are Babs (Kathryn Hahn), who uses sexual advances towards desperate men to move her share of the cars; Jibby (Ving Rhames) who looks tough, but admits he has never made love to woman; and Brent (David Koechner) who tells us while he's eating at a strip club, that he doesn't think he can eat breakfast at any place but a strip club.They have to sell more than 200 cars over Fourth of July weekend. It should be no problem for this team of ruthless salesmen. But what Don didn't plan on, was falling for his new boss' daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro). Is he an untamable stallion, destined for life alone on the road, or will she win his heart and cause him to fail at his goal of clearing her father's lot?As if that's not enough pressure for Don, if he does in fact fall short of moving these cars, Selleck's lot will be handed over to Ivy's scumbag,, soon to be father-in-law, Stu (Alan Thicke). Ivy's fianc&eacute; Paxton (Ed Helms) is a complete tool, who dreams of becoming famous in his three-man `boy-band' comprised of men all over the age of 30. For a guy like Don Ready, the challenge is stiff, as he will naturally want to have the girl and sell the goods.The movie is jam-packed full of some of the funniest comedians out there right now. One of whom is a rock-star in the world of comedy and is un-credited in the film and will remain so in this review. Trust me, you will appreciate the surprise.The film is dirty but witty and we like it that way. To shed light on a few of these moments; Ben Selleck obviously has some closeted homo-sexual tendencies, because he is constantly flirting with and sexually harassing Brent. Selleck also has a 10-year-old son who due to an abnormal birth-defect, looks like he's 30. Babs is completely infatuated with the 10-year-old nonetheless, and is relentlessly trying to come up with ways to seduce him, without his knowing he's being seduced. It sounds like it could be bad, but trust me it's all executed very well and it's hilarious.No punches are pulled folks. If you think they've gone too far with one inappropriate joke or gag, then you may want to duck because another one is sure to follow. There is racial humor, sexual humor (sometimes even involving parachutes and sex toys) and there are plenty of stabs at car salesman schemes and scams that will have you rolling.There are a ton of enjoyable comedies with fast-talking, foul mouthed, self involved guys, who think they are big shots, and this is one of them.

Bring in an auto mercenary: Don ""The Goods"" Ready, who decides that if he can't sell every last car off the lot over the 4th of July weekend, he'll retire.  Is he up for the challenge?Of course he is; and, in the hands of Jeremy Piven, Ready is an unlikable slop, a hit-em-hard-and-leave-em-crying kinda guy.  Piven isn't necessarily perfect for the role (this film is way below him) but he's at least enjoyable; the same for James Brolin, who is slumming it hardcore but is at least having a ball (in more ways than one...).  Ving Rhames is a pleasant surprise, adding a unique little twist into this by-the-numbers farce.  Really, there's nothing here we haven't seen before: raunchy jokes that are hit and miss; the same for racist and sexist and every other kind of joke (the hate crime segment is particularly hilarious); a rocking soundtrack (with karaoke); a wounded hero who has the opportunity to find out a little something about himself; a laugh-out-loud Will Ferrell cameo (two of them, actually); and your 21st century farce supporting characters: David Koechner (hilarious as always); Rob Riggle (as a ten-year-old); Ken Jeong (not as funny as in ""Role Models,"" but still pretty good); Kathryn Hahn (a stand-out); Alan Thicke (grossly under-used); Craig Robinson, Kristin Schaal, and a whole host of other faces you'll recognize.As you may have guessed, ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"" isn't anything new; this is both good and bad.  It never really tries to break new ground or stand out from the crowd.  This really isn't a mortal sin (there's something to be a said for a movie that knows its own limitations); but then again, with A-list talent like Jeremy Piven, James Brolin, and Ving Rhames behind it, we're kind of expecting something new.  You'll get a few great laughs out of ""The Goods;"" the Will Ferrell sky-diving scene in particular is truly memorable, and there's some fantastic irony in Ving Rhames saying, ""My safe word is 'blueberry pancakes'"" (for you ""Pulp Fiction"" fans out there).

But it all seems to work, perhaps because Will Ferrell didn't star in this Will Ferrell movie. He did manage a small role, which he typically smelled up. The movie is based on an occupation I don't believe exists, which is a crack team of migrant expert car sellers. They get the call to save a dealership. The movie has some laugh out loud lines like DJ Request saying, ""Nobody tells DJ Request what to play."" Or ""Did you ever have a relationship last longer than a lap dance?"" Besides the smelly scene with Will Ferrell, Ed Helms was fairly bad. I loved Ed on the Daily Show, but face it, he can't act. Rob Riggle did a good job as a 10 year old. The movie moves along smartly through the first day of sales after which the plot suddenly changes direction.

1279559,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B002N5N5UM,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 2]","This movie begins with an old racist car salesman getting into a fist fight with a potential buyer and Ken Jeong coming in with stolen money from a bank heist that blows up in his face. The scene shifts to Jeremy Piven in a strip club with his team and then Piven in an airplane where he convinces the flight attendant to allow him to smoke on some terrible ""this is America"" speech. The fact that he's supposed to be working his magic with such a trite little speech is a total Finding Forrester Fake Out (ie. the case of a movie telling you that you are supposed to feel something despite all evidence to the contrary). As soon as they get to the dealership, they run into Rob Riggle as a 10-year old boy in the body of a 35 year old man. This is supposed to be funny.And that pretty much encapsulates what is wrong with this movie. The writing is too lazy to truly mine any comedy out of the set ups. In its place are situations that the writers think are hilarious but turn out to be ""hilarious"" without much stake. What makes this movie such a shame is that its full of really good actors who try their best to get blood out of the stone of the material. But for every funny setup that kind of works (such as the disgruntled DJ that will never play what people request and gets angry about it) there are terrible jokes that are supposed to be funny because they are audacious or offensive (such as the racist old used car salesman). Will Ferrell is funny but having two women behind him singing profanities as if they are sing gospel is an example of ""hilarious"".Also, Jeremy Piven really can't carry a movie. The fact that he became the best part of Entourage had more to do with the awfulness of the other actors and the short duration of the episodes.I went in with moderate expectations and was disappointed. Three or four decent scenes are not enough to justify a movie that reads as if the producer decided to hire his teenage nephews as screenwriters.",2,"Not enough ok bits to justify the awful groan inducing ""jokes""",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1963,"['movie', 'old', 'racist', 'car', 'salesman', 'getting', 'fist', 'fight', 'potential', 'buyer', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'coming', 'stolen', 'money', 'bank', 'heist', 'up', 'face', 'scene', 'shifts', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'strip', 'club', 'team', 'then', 'Piven', 'airplane', 'where', 'flight', 'attendant', 'allow', 'smoke', 'terrible', 'America', 'speech', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'working', 'magic', 'trite', 'little', 'speech', 'total', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'Fake', 'Out', 'ie', 'case', 'movie', 'telling', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'something', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'As', 'soon', 'get', 'dealership', 'run', 'Rob', 'Riggle', '10-year', 'old', 'boy', 'body', '35', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny.And', 'pretty', 'much', 'encapsulates', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'writing', 'too', 'lazy', 'truly', 'mine', 'comedy', 'set', 'ups', 'place', 'are', 'situations', 'writers', 'think', 'are', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hilarious', 'much', 'stake', 'What', 'movie', 'shame', 'full', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'try', 'best', 'get', 'blood', 'stone', 'material', 'funny', 'setup', 'kind', 'works', 'such', 'disgruntled', 'DJ', 'will', 'never', 'play', 'what', 'people', 'request', 'angry', 'are', 'terrible', 'jokes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'are', 'audacious', 'offensive', 'such', 'racist', 'old', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'funny', 'having', 'two', 'women', 'singing', 'profanities', 'are', 'sing', 'gospel', 'example', 'hilarious', '.Also', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'movie', 'fact', 'became', 'best', 'part', 'Entourage', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'awfulness', 'other', 'actors', 'short', 'duration', 'episodes.I', 'went', 'moderate', 'expectations', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Three', 'four', 'decent', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'movie', 'producer', 'decided', 'hire', 'teenage', 'nephews', 'screenwriters']","The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"
