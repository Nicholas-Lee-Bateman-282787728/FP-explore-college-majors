876052,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0006ZXJ3O,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[17, 19]","This is a wonderful film.  In many ways it reminds me of the play Our Town, which is also set in the afterlife of one of the characters.  While Our Town generally uses an almost empty stage with a ladder or a chair as setting, the settings of the Five People You Met in Heaven are incredible and imaginatively done.  The World War II Pacific theater setting captured the essence of the experience without going over the top.  It was a case of ""less is more.""  In the instance of the early 20th century amusement park, the setting was like a memory distilled from childhood with everything more vivid than reality but reduced to essentials.  The park was without the holiday crowd, the grounds were free of debris, a place in time designed by the shorthand of the mind.The plot is created through a string of vignettes interlaced with flash backs relating the life stories of the characters in relation to that of the central character.  Flashbacks introduce important information about encounters without making the story itself seem choppy.  This is amazing since they occur with such regularity and in such measure, that it is almost only the engagement of the viewer with the plot that prevents confusion over which story is flashback and which is central theme.Of all the characters, I think I enjoyed the Blue Man the most.  He seemed menacing at first and I almost wondered what evil deed he had done.  His story made me realize how often we judge others by their appearance and their motives by our own fear of the unknown.  One thinks of the ever increasing numbers of individuals we encounter on our streets who come from other cultures, ones that seem just as mysterious and suspicious as the Blue Man.  When we react to them negatively we might in fact be adding more misery to a life that has sustained more than its fair share of it.The character I found least engaging but most instructive was the Father.  The isolation of the man continued even into death.  He looked like a person who had been knocked senseless.  Unable to pull himself from his own disappointments, he was as unable to respond to his son's needs after death as he had been in life.  He was a soul kept ""safe,"" by a character who had very little to do with the actual story.  It was she who explained the meaning of his life with relation to the central character not he.  It would appear he'd  traveled through life as an anomaly and continued to be one after death.An interesting and moving story.",5,The meaning of a life,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2483,"['wonderful', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'play', 'Town', 'also', 'set', 'afterlife', 'one', 'characters', 'Town', 'generally', 'almost', 'empty', 'stage', 'ladder', 'chair', 'setting', 'settings', 'Five', 'People', 'Met', 'Heaven', 'are', 'incredible', 'imaginatively', 'done', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'setting', 'captured', 'essence', 'experience', 'going', 'top', 'was', 'case', 'less', 'more', 'instance', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'amusement', 'park', 'setting', 'was', 'memory', 'distilled', 'childhood', 'everything', 'more', 'vivid', 'reality', 'reduced', 'essentials', 'park', 'was', 'holiday', 'crowd', 'grounds', 'were', 'free', 'debris', 'place', 'time', 'designed', 'shorthand', 'mind.The', 'plot', 'created', 'string', 'vignettes', 'interlaced', 'flash', 'backs', 'relating', 'life', 'stories', 'characters', 'relation', 'central', 'character', 'Flashbacks', 'introduce', 'important', 'information', 'encounters', 'making', 'story', 'seem', 'choppy', 'amazing', 'occur', 'such', 'regularity', 'such', 'measure', 'almost', 'only', 'engagement', 'viewer', 'plot', 'confusion', 'story', 'flashback', 'central', 'characters', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'Blue', 'Man', 'most', 'seemed', 'menacing', 'first', 'almost', 'wondered', 'what', 'evil', 'deed', 'had', 'done', 'story', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'often', 'judge', 'others', 'appearance', 'motives', 'own', 'fear', 'unknown', 'One', 'ever', 'increasing', 'numbers', 'individuals', 'encounter', 'streets', 'who', 'come', 'other', 'cultures', 'ones', 'seem', 'just', 'as', 'mysterious', 'suspicious', 'Blue', 'Man', 'When', 'react', 'negatively', 'might', 'fact', 'be', 'adding', 'more', 'misery', 'life', 'sustained', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'it.The', 'character', 'found', 'least', 'engaging', 'most', 'instructive', 'was', 'Father', 'isolation', 'man', 'continued', 'even', 'death', 'looked', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'knocked', 'senseless', 'Unable', 'pull', 'own', 'disappointments', 'was', 'unable', 'respond', 'son', 'needs', 'death', 'had', 'been', 'life', 'was', 'soul', 'kept', 'safe', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'story', 'was', 'who', 'explained', 'meaning', 'life', 'relation', 'central', 'character', 'not', 'would', 'appear', ""'d"", 'traveled', 'through', 'life', 'anomaly', 'continued', 'be', 'one', 'death.An', 'interesting', 'moving', 'story']",N/A

I saw the move when it was broadcast on television and loved it as much as I did the book.  Mitch Albom wrote both the book and the screenplay and stayed true to the story in the latter.  This is a fantasy.  It is based on a story Mr. Albom heard from his mother's brother, his Uncle Eddie.  The heart of this story is the connection we all have with one another and how our lives can effect others and how they can effect ours.  To paraphrase Ruby  in the film, a stranger is just family you haven't yet met.  The view of heaven in the film probably differs from most people's opinion, and it is an idealistic one.  This film picks up where ""It's A Wonderful Life"" left off.  The explanation for the meaning of life is interesting.  The sound quality on the disc is not the best I've heard.  At times the music drowns out the dialog and the close captioning did not work on mine as well.  But I am reviewing the film on the merits of the story itself and that is why I gave the movie five stars.  If heaven is really like Eddie's, we will all be blessed to get there.  Since I haven't visited there yet, I just enjoy the film and take it for the fantasy it really is.

876056,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0006ZXJ3O,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 6]","If you've readTuesdays with Morrieby Mitch Albom, then you know the author's got a way with wrenching your emotions. I've never teared up as much as when I'd read that book; the story of a student and his old teacher who was dying of a horribly debilitating disease. But it also had a fairly high schmaltz factor. THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN also has that sappiness running through it, but with a serious religious bent to boot (not surprising considering the title).The story is that of Eddie (Jon Voight,National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets) and his life as a repairman at an entertainment park. Many things have happened at this unique place. It's where Eddie's father worked day in and day out all of his life. It's where Eddie fell in love with his future wife Marguerite (Dagmar Dominczyk,24 TV series). It's the place where Eddie would leave in order to fight and become injured in WW II. And it's where Eddie would eventually die while trying to save the life of a child.The story takes place immediately after Eddie's death, and we get to see five flashbacks via five people that Eddie thought he never knew. The first is Blue Man (Jeff Daniels,The Lookout) who was a sideshow freak at the carnival. Little did Eddie know he'd touched Blue Man in a very special way, but also may have been partially responsible for his death.The second is Captain (Michael Imperioli,Shark Tale) who was his commanding officer during WW II. Both having been captured and tortured during the war, they also broke themselves free and torched their prison before departing. It was also during this time that Eddie was wounded in the knee, making him unable to walk normally for the rest of his life. But who shot him? And were there any people in those prison huts they burned down?The third person is Eddie's own Marguerite. Having not seen his wife since her death many years before, Eddie comes to understand just how much he loved her ...but also how much he'd held back due to his own past during the war.The fourth is someone he'd never met in life but had worked for during most of his time on Earth, Ruby (Ellen Burstyn,The Fountain), for whom the park was named where Eddie worked. The destruction and rebuilding of Ruby's Pier (the name of the entertainment park) is an analogy for the same thing Eddie must do in order to salvage himself from the destructive behavior toward his abusive father.The fifth and final person is someone, again, Eddie had never met but who's life he touched in a very significant way. Telling you who and how this happened would be a huge spoiler, so I'll just say that, in true scripture fashion, Eddie is able to ""wash away"" his sins and become someone worthy of heavenly entry.The biggest challenge for some viewers will be trying to separate the acting/scenes with the religious themes being rammed down their throats. But if you're able to separate them, you might enjoy it on some levels. Although morally it's a tale of one man's eventual redemption in the afterlife, it also has some pretty good acting and interesting sets for a made-for-TV Hallmark presentation.A message to those who are ""true believers"": please try not to thump your bibles too loudly.",3,Scripture As Film,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,3199,"[""'ve"", 'readTuesdays', 'Morrieby', 'Mitch', 'Albom', 'then', 'know', 'author', 'got', 'way', 'wrenching', 'emotions', ""'ve"", 'never', 'teared', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'when', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'story', 'student', 'old', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'dying', 'horribly', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'also', 'had', 'fairly', 'high', 'schmaltz', 'factor', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'PEOPLE', 'YOU', 'MEET', 'IN', 'HEAVEN', 'also', 'sappiness', 'running', 'serious', 'religious', 'bent', 'boot', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'title', '.The', 'story', 'Eddie', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'National', 'Treasure', '2', 'Book', 'Secrets', 'life', 'repairman', 'entertainment', 'park', 'Many', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'unique', 'place', 'where', 'Eddie', 'father', 'worked', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'where', 'Eddie', 'fell', 'love', 'future', 'wife', 'Marguerite', 'Dagmar', 'Dominczyk,24', 'TV', 'series', 'place', 'where', 'Eddie', 'would', 'leave', 'order', 'fight', 'become', 'injured', 'WW', 'II', 'where', 'Eddie', 'would', 'eventually', 'die', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'child.The', 'story', 'place', 'immediately', 'Eddie', 'death', 'get', 'see', 'five', 'flashbacks', 'five', 'people', 'Eddie', 'thought', 'never', 'knew', 'first', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Lookout', 'who', 'was', 'sideshow', 'freak', 'carnival', 'Little', 'did', 'Eddie', 'know', ""'d"", 'touched', 'Blue', 'Man', 'very', 'special', 'way', 'also', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'partially', 'responsible', 'death.The', 'second', 'Captain', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'who', 'was', 'commanding', 'officer', 'WW', 'II', 'having', 'been', 'captured', 'tortured', 'war', 'also', 'broke', 'free', 'torched', 'prison', 'departing', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'Eddie', 'was', 'wounded', 'knee', 'making', 'unable', 'walk', 'normally', 'rest', 'life', 'who', 'shot', 'were', 'there', 'people', 'prison', 'burned', 'down', 'third', 'person', 'Eddie', 'own', 'Marguerite', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'wife', 'death', 'many', 'years', 'Eddie', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'also', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'held', 'back', 'due', 'own', 'past', 'war.The', 'fourth', 'someone', ""'d"", 'never', 'met', 'life', 'had', 'worked', 'most', 'time', 'Earth', 'Ruby', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Fountain', 'whom', 'park', 'was', 'named', 'where', 'Eddie', 'worked', 'destruction', 'rebuilding', 'Ruby', 'Pier', 'name', 'entertainment', 'park', 'analogy', 'same', 'thing', 'Eddie', 'must', 'do', 'order', 'salvage', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'abusive', 'father.The', 'fifth', 'final', 'person', 'someone', 'again', 'Eddie', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'who', 'life', 'touched', 'very', 'significant', 'way', 'Telling', 'who', 'how', 'happened', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'true', 'scripture', 'fashion', 'Eddie', 'able', 'wash', 'away', 'sins', 'become', 'someone', 'worthy', 'heavenly', 'entry.The', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'trying', 'separate', 'acting/scenes', 'religious', 'themes', 'being', 'rammed', 'down', 'throats', ""'re"", 'able', 'separate', 'might', 'enjoy', 'levels', 'morally', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'eventual', 'redemption', 'afterlife', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'sets', 'made-for-TV', 'Hallmark', 'presentation.A', 'message', 'who', 'are', 'true', 'believers', 'please', 'try', 'not', 'thump', 'bibles', 'too', 'loudly']",N/A

In those kind of movies: I know exactly what parts are practical from the ones thats hollywood exaggerated!And I must honestly say that this movie is real from beginning to end! Theirs a couple of little points that could be addressed though. Such as: For instance, All of the interaction that we have with others while living goes far beyond just 5 people. Because throughout life, we as people; dont know just how connected we are to each other in some fashion form or another.When we hurts others; in the long run, we really end up hurting ourself! And as time goes on the numbers become so great! To where we go on throughout our life ""unknowing"" from lack of memory the harm we inflected on others.Well this movie uses 5 people as an example. Towards how we and others are directly linked beyond just living in the here and now. Because one thing that people in general dont realize is: Whatever life that (We live here and now) Becomes an extension of our life in the here after! When dealing with Panoramic Views,The ""Real"" Near Death Experiencers, who in which go further into their ""Past"" and ""Present"" simultaneously, Because else where- Time is not how we perceive it here at all!Anyway! Their are also conscious out of body experiences which a person can even go further into insight on matters. Because people dont've to die nor nearly die,in order to find out deeper truths which reside on the otherside while living here and now on this side! Its just that when totally crossing over takes place- You no longer have the limitations of the physical body.(Though its our vessel that our soul resides in)The vessel is still very important in this world to have!(Thats why its so vital to try to keep it healthy as possible!)And Of course theirs so much more to things than whats being at this time expressed in this review. But one doesn't have that kind of time to go deeper, nor would it be something necessary to get into anyway!The purpose of this review is simply to give the deserving props that this film deserves! I would give this 100 stars if that was the highest rating that could be given! Because not only is it so practical and serious from beginning to end. But its a movie that everyone in this world should watch!Yes, its that serious! Because we face alot of unresolved issues,situations and circumstances of various kind. When we either get into other States Of Consciousness,Near Death Experiences(Depending on how far the person merges,Conscious Out Of Body Experiences,Real Time Travel(Not by machine interpretations nor from ones imagination)But the real deal!Through Meditation Practices(After Years Of Training)Etc; Their are various ways by many methods: However not only is it necessary! But also, their are to many to name!The simple point is: While living our everyday life: Its so essential for all of us to live it wisely! Just like the movie is depicting- We need to understand our actions and deeds. We need to understand that our connection to others goes far beyond what we currently while living in a temporal body know!We also need to know that what we do here along with how we act. That we carry those things along with us to the otherside. We need to know that whoever and however we are here: That we create, as well as, ""Recreate""(An extension of ourself)elsewhere. We need to know that, we end up either creating for ourself, A Heaven or A Hell. It all depends on the things that we do here and now in this current life.Its just that this movie was meant for a good means to an end! And or, bet yet said! It was meant to let the viewer know that, Death is just the beginning towards living another life. The movie did a very thoroughly practical job with presenting a certain side of the coin. And that side that it presents was an Old Man who lived his life loving and helping children as well as others. Well our own life should be about helping others also!(The movie was also about sacrifices)And how far they go!It was also about Genuine Love! It was about how doing good deeds throughout life matter. This wonderful movie has alot of things to offer!And remember, if you decide to purchase this movie and view it. You'll see why the Old Man ended up being in a good place in the afterlife!Though I could've gone on and on about this wondeful movie! I'll end it here by saying is: Always make sure that your deeds are righteous ones! Because every action that we do is recorded in the Here After.P.S. Make sure your thoughts and actions are righteous ones! In order to assure ending up in a good place instead of a bad one! Each of us are responsible for our deeds, rather if they're good or bad.

These words are uttered by Ellen Burstyn at the end of this Hallmark movie version of that persistent little best seller by Mitch Albom THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN.  And that about sums up the content of this simplistic story of how all of us are connected, that each of our lives is significant even if not apparent while being lived.Mitch Albom serves a purpose as a writer.  He produces small short stories as books that are quick reads, have a dollop of 'feel good' philosophy, and provides an entry to folks who may not ordinarily read books as part of their pastimes.  And there is considerable merit to that.  From the legions who have read his 'Tuesdays with Morrie' and 'Five People You Meet in Heaven' it is fairly obvious that there is a public out there who is hungry for some homespun faith: the atmosphere around the globe is threatening enough to our psyches that we do need some spiritual nurturing.  And if Albom provides that, I think that is a step in the right direction.Great writing here?  No.  The screenplay is by Albom and as worked by director Lloyd Kramer we are given almost two and a half hours of this story that doesn't take that long to read in book form.  But in many ways this drawn out presentation helps make a better story rather than the quick preach of the book.  Eddie (John Voight + Callahan Brebner + Steven Grayhm) is a maintenance man for a seaside boardwalk Ruby's Pier where he has spent his entire life (with the exception of a tour of duty in the battlefields of WW II) feeling like he is trapped into a thankless life, filled with mistakes and regrets.  His sole concern is for the safety of the rides in the amusement park: the story begins with his death due to a faulty ride in which he attempts to intervene at the 13th hour to save a young girl's life.Being dead, he enters 'heaven' which just happens to be a cleaned up Ruby's Pier.  He meets five folk who each teach him lessons about his life - lessons that are accompanied by flashbacks to significant moments, events, and memories.  These five people are enacted by Jeff Daniels, Michael Imperioli, Ellen Burstyn, Dagmara Dominczyk and Nicaela & Shelbie Weigel  and it is through their graces that Albom's secrets are transmitted to Eddie.Not a complex plot, not a complex movie, but one done with enough color and skill to warrant its Hallmark seal of approval.  And that is really OK. Just don't expect depth.

876076,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006ZXJ3O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","This guy Eddie, he was a fresh-faced young soldier trying to do his part during the second world war. This guy Eddie, he got old not having done anything or gone anywhere that he wasn't shipped to with a rifle. In his remaining years he was a maintenance man with a heavy limp toiling away at an amusement park at the pier, and the kids all called him ""Eddie Maintenance"" because of that name tag on his work shirt. One day at work Eddie died trying to save the life of a little girl, and, in dying, the next chapter in his adventure begins. A wasted life? Don't assume such.THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is adapted from writer Mitch Albom's best-seller, and no worries, no worries at all, if you've read the book and liked it, because this movie stays faithful and it does justice to its source material. Like the book it is powerful and deeply emotional and ultimately rewarding. The story tells of a man's life lived simply and humbly, with dreams unrealized and ambition unfulfilled. To his dying day and even beyond that, Eddie believed that he led a nothin' life. The five people he meets in heaven show him how wrong he is, and that there is a purpose to things. That ""There are no random acts. We are all connected."" I don't usually drink from that sort of inspirational juice, but when the vessel comes this well done and heartfelt, well, don't mind if I take a sip or three.The cast is uniformly strong, with a wonderful Jon Voight anchoring things. The two younger actors who play Eddie in the flashback sequences are also very good. The premise is thought-provoking, that in heaven the newly deceased would run into five people who would come to lend a sort of clarity to what was one's mortal existence, and that these five people may even be characters who had been inconsequential in one's life (one of the five, Eddie never even met when alive). Eddie's time on earth had been wracked with pain and suffering. Begin with the abusive father, then the dream to be an engineer shattered, and then stuck in a dead-end job, and finally losing a dear one all too soon and left by oneself for many lonely years. But there's a reason to all this.The cinematography is shot vividly and sensitively. There are three interweaving time lines - the past, the present, and Eddie in Heaven - and there are clear visual clues - and a distinctive color palette assigned per era - to indicate the respective time period. Heaven being Heaven, it's maybe not a surprise that some of the celestial sets seem straight out of Tim Burton's mind, and I'm referring to the sense of surreal that's evoked.If nothing else, there are two truly enthralling moments which make this film worth watching. The first is a montage which spans Eddie and Marguerite's years together, this with minimal dialogue and set to the song ""Pocketful of Rainbows."" It is remarkably moving. And then there's Eddie meeting the fifth person in heaven, and this hands down is the most powerful moment in the film, and you have to hand it to Jon Voight and to the young actress who plays the fifth person. You might, just might, get choked up. I sorta did, and, yeah, I realize I'm gonna have to talk a lot of sports (and maybe work in Home Depot in the conversation) to get over that unmanly admission. But it's that kind of movie, just like it was that kind of book. It'll stir stuff in you.The DVD special features: an audio commentary by Director Lloyd Kramer, Novelist Mitch Albom, and Actor Jon Voight (worth a listen); 21 minutes worth of interviews with author Mitch Albom, actors Jon Voight, Steven Grayhm (young Eddie), and Michael Imperioli, and costume designer Tish Monaghan; and ""Makeup Magic"": Jon Voight Makeup Session. There's also a trailer for EARTHSEA, but feel free to skip it.There is a Blue Man in the movie, and, unlike those guys in Vegas, this Blue Man is dignified and not at all annoying.",4,"""Here's where you're supposed to be...

876078,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B0006ZXJ3O,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[194, 207]","""This is a story of a man named Eddie who was shown the secret of heaven: that each life affects the other, and the other affects the next. The world is full of stories, but the stories are all one."" - The Five People You Meet In Heaven DVDA critical, abusive, alcoholic father. The nightmares--and a physical wound--courtesy of war. Infertility. A beloved wife struck down with a neurological disease. Evaporating dreams of being an engineer, replaced with a life-long job as a theme park maintenance man.Eddie feels like a loser. He was a nobody-his alcoholic father made sure of that. Working at the theme park Ruby's Pier, like his father before him, is how Eddie died and went to heaven.Author Mitch Albom wrote the script for the made-for-TV movie The Five People You Meet In Heaven, which is based on his bestselling book. The theme of this story is that no life is a waste, no matter how seemingly insignificant-and that there are no random acts, because all are connected.The profound but simple truths in this poignant story by Albom reflect the themes that all is one, there are no random acts, and that peace, learning and growth face us on the Other Side.On a sunny day at Ruby's Pier, a cable system breaks down on an amusement ride, and Eddie, played by veteran actor Jon Voight, tries to save a girl from death. He feels small hands in his as he tries to pull her to safety.""When Eddie died, he felt no pain. He experienced calm-as if every pain he experienced on Earth was washed away.""In heaven, Eddie is first met by a man who used to be a part of Ruby Pier's freak show-a man tinted blue by a chemical tincture he drank as a child. The man of blue (brilliantly played by Jeff Daniels) tells Eddie that he will meet five people in heaven, and each will share things which will be a lesson for Eddie. The part that the Blue Man played in Eddie's life was unknown until Eddie arrives in heaven: as a small boy, Eddie was playing ball in the street, and the Blue Man, driving down the same street, swerved to miss him. The Blue Man ended up dying of a heart attack, and Eddie was unaware of his part in the story.When the Blue Man shared what happen, Eddie felt badly-that the accident wasn't fair, and that it should have been him that died. The blue man replies: ""There is no fair in life and death. If it were, no good men would die young."" Eddie assumes that he will now pay for his ""sin"" and be judged. The Blue Man dismisses this idea, almost with amusement: ""No, no, no."", he says, shaking his head. In heaven, there is no judgment, but rather an opportunity to examine our lives-who we touched, the choices we made, and the consequences of those choices.Eddie is then visited by four more people, in their own unique heaven. Forgiveness is another theme of the story, and the character of Ruby tells Eddie: ""Hatred is a curved blade. The harm we do to others is harm we do to ourselves...no one is born with anger. It builds up over time, with the things we don't say and the things we bury. When we die, the soul is freed of it-free to see the truth.""The process that Eddie goes through when he dies is consistent with the case studies featured in the books Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls by hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton. No angry God awaits us at the gates of death, but instead, we are met with kind, loving guides and souls-eventually being ushered into a personally designed `curriculum' for our soul's growth and edification. When Eddie meets his former military captain in his personal heaven the captain says to him: ""Time isn't what you think it is, kid. Neither is dying."" Also consistent with between-life regression case histories is the ability for souls to change shape (like Eddie's wife did when he asked her to become ""old"" again), as well as the ability to ""choose"" your heaven.The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a story of redemption and personal meaning, as Eddie finally realizes that everything- even difficulties, disappointments, and deaths-happen for a reason. We're also reminded that ""all endings are beginnings. We just don't know it at the time...""Throughout the story, Eddie calls himself a loser, feeling that he did not accomplish anything with his life (like going to engineering school as he planned). He felt alone, and without anything to show for his life. However, at the end of meeting the five people from his life on the Other Side, Eddie is shown the results of his everyday, ""mundane"" work as an amusement park maintenance man: a sea of people of every age, race, and walk of life that were kept safe over the years by his diligence:""All the accidents he prevented, all the people he kept safe-their children, and their children's children-are because of the things he did day after day.""The human search for a sense of meaning and purpose to life is a deep one. Perhaps the first thoughts of the first human were ""Who am I? Why am I here?"" We're still asking these questions--and desperately looking for the answer.Living in an increasingly complex and stressful era, it's tempting to think that the mundane is meaningless and that life is a random crapshoot. I was deeply moved by this story, reminded that no interpersonal interaction is by chance, and that every cruel, painful, or disappointing situation serves a higher purpose that will someday be explained. The Five People You Meet In Heaven shows that, truly, no life is a ""waste"", and no life is insignificant. My story is a part of your story, because all of us are connected in the web of life.",5,No Life Is Meaningless,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,5539,"['story', 'man', 'named', 'Eddie', 'who', 'was',

876104,AS3KEJ5ICJY9J,B0006ZXJ3O,Michelle  J,"[0, 0]","This is a most healing story. We all hav unanswered questions about our lives and the lives of others. Many of those questions won't be answered fully in this life. That is why in I Corinthians 13, the description of God's love includes that love...God keeps no record of our wrongs. That is how Jesus could say, while beiing crucified, &#34;Father forgive them, for they KNOW NOT what they do.&#34; I truly believe this film, and the book, was divinely inspired. In Revelation ch. 4, the unnumbered multitude is mentioned, which represent those in heaven that only God could count, because only God knows their heart. I believe that these are all who die, not knowing the truth about God's love and forgiveness, and need to be further enlightened in the next life. Mitch Albom and Lloyd Kramer do an excellent job illustrating the possible way this can happen.I read the book in 2006, and watched the film in 2009. The first time I watched the film, the last scene with the blue man touched me when Eddie says, &#34;My life was a waste.&#34; The blue man responds, &#34;No life is a waste.&#34;  But what I heard was, &#34;No life is a waste, every life has a purpose, every person is part of a plan.&#34; I stopped the film after that scene to finish later. When I went back to watch the rest, I began at the last scene with the blue man. I was waiting for those wonderful lines that I actually had journaled because they were so inspiring. When I only heard him say, &#34;No life is a waste.&#34; I knew I had heard from God what my heart needed so badly to hear. It was healiing.The last scene with Talla, the little girl perfectly follows the spiritual symbolism of the Bible. Water is words. Rivers are streams of thoughts. Rocks are concepts.

It seems that Mitch Albom (the author of Five People You Meet in Heaven) did involve a lot of the film's production, and you can find his interview clip in the special feature section. In total 133 minutes of the film, only some minor details have been cut and altered from the book, but they didn't affect the story line, and the whole movie is still very touching, heartwarming, and inspiring. It's definitely worth to re-watch and enjoy the dialog lines again. Not many features come with the DVD, but closed captions, director and writer commentaries, as well as some interviews with the cast & crew. I find the greatest bonus in this DVD is the interview with the book's writer Mitch Albom. You can hear how he came up with such story and what messages he would like both the book readers and film audiences to get.

During the two hours of completely captivating storytelling, we journey into the mind of a man who thought his life was a pointless series of daily tasks as a maintenance man.When he dies suddenly after attempting to save a child's life, he endures a review of his life, complete with flashbacks and a few guilt trips. The startling realities of how things actually occurred as opposed to how Eddie viewed his life at the time makes this a movie filled with constant surprises and insightful viewpoints.The transitions between the scenes are often inspired and at times the change in volume can be a little startling. As you strain to hear the Blue Man from Algeria's voice at the Ruby Pier, you may want to keep the remote handy to turn down the volume during the war scenes. The violence in this movie is brief, but does present a troubling depiction of heaven if you think Eddie is in heaven. Give this movie time to unfold and you will love the underwater images and the final revelations.The tale is woven so well, you never really know what will happen next and it almost becomes a guessing game to find out who Eddie will talk to next. In the tradition of movies in the past, Eddie is illuminated by revisiting his past on numerous occasions.The mood is thoughtful and the main message seems to be about how our lives are inextricably woven together, even when we don't even realize our influence.~The Rebecca Review",4,All Endings are Also Beginnings,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,1511,"['Five', 'People', 'Meet', 'Heaven', 'times', 'phantasmagorical', 'tale', 'Eddie', 'life', 'two', 'hours', 'completely', 'captivating', 'storytelling', 'journey', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'life', 'was', 'pointless', 'series', 'daily', 'tasks', 'maintenance', 'man.When', 'suddenly', 'attempting', 'save', 'child', 'life', 'review', 'life', 'complete', 'flashbacks', 'few', 'guilt', 'trips', 'startling', 'realities', 'how', 'things', 'actually', 'occurred', 'opposed', 'how', 'Eddie', 'viewed', 'life', 'time', 'movie', 'filled', 'constant', 'surprises', 'insightful', 'viewpoints.The', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'inspired', 'times', 'change', 'volume', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'startling', 'strain', 'hear', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Algeria', 'voice', 'Ruby', 'Pier', 'may', 'want', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'war', 'scenes', 'violence', 'movie', 'brief', 'present', 'troubling', 'depiction', 'heaven', 'think', 'Eddie', 'heaven', 'Give', 'movie', 'time', 'unfold', 'will', 'love', 'underwater', 'images', 'final', 'revelations.The', 'tale', 'woven', 'so', 'well', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'almost', 'guessing', 'game', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Eddie', 'will', 'talk', 'next', 'tradition', 'movies', 'past', 'Eddie', 'illuminated', 'revisiting', 'past', 'numerous', 'occasions.The', 'mood', 'thoughtful', 'main', 'message', 'be', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'inextricably', 'woven', 'together', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'influence.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Thank you to everyone for making such a profoundly moving two hours! This is a healing journey well worth taking.The foundation of the movie is the wonderful book by Mitch Albom, and thanks to the lucky stars in heaven, Mr. Albom's involvement in the script and some exemplary acting, the movie is as creative and lovely as the book!  You experience an entire life:  a childhood with troubled parents, emotionally-rending WWII service, a bittersweet romance which cannot produce children, final fading days of old age and ""wondering what it was all for"".  Then... enter Eternity (one of the most beautiful and involving ""Eternity""s I've seen depicted on film) and find out the preciousness of what it all meant... and that ""death"" is the beginning of more life.I think there is excellent, understated acting here. Delicious colors, whimsical sets and costumes. Instead of taking a more superficial, platitudinous route, which other films and books have (including, in my opinion, The Christmas Box), this movie grabs hold of the deepest parts of you and refuses to let go.

That and with the concept, I was a bit worried this might be some nauseating crap like ""Touched by an Angel"".  However, because there were so many great actors involved, I decided to give it a chance, and that decision was definitely the right one.Jon Voight plays Eddie, an old man who's been working as a maintenance man at a carnival for over 60 years.  One day, on his 83rd birthday, he is killed attempting to save a little girl in a tragic accident.  He soon finds himself in heaven, where he is visited by five different people from his past.  Up to this point, Eddie felt that his life was wasted, like he'd never done anything terribly important.  However, each person tells him a story from their past, and explains to him how knowing him made a positive difference in their life.  With each visit, Eddie begins to develop a new appreciation for his life, and how his actions affected those around him.This movie benefits most from the stellar cast.  Jeff Daniels, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Imperioli all have great supporting roles, and we also have great performances from numerous obscure Canadian actors, like Rebecca Jenkins, Elias Toufexis, and Callum Keith Rennie.  You may not recognize those names, but trust me, these are talented folks (especially Rennie, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors). And we can't forget Steven Graym, who is excellent as Voight's younger counterpart.But of course Jon Voight is the one who really stands out the most.  He is a living legend, and here he once again proves why.  To be honest, this movie does kind of pour on the schmaltz a little bit, but the great acting helps to make it all more sincere, and Voight's incredibly powerful performance is certainly no small part of that.  The ""diner scene"" with him and Rennie is just...wow.  Anyone interested in acting should study this scene to learn how to suck less.Another thing I really liked about this movie is that despite the subject matter, it never gets particularly preachy.  In fact, there's barely any religious implications here at all.  Eddie was never a devout christian in his life, and his father was even farther from it, but they still both make it to heaven based purely upon the merits of their actions in life.  Now, I have no idea if heaven really exists or not, but if it did, I think that is exactly the way it should work.Anyway, this turned out to be a pretty good movie, with great acting and an interesting story.  Even if was just a ""movie of the week"", it definitely surpassed my expectations.

It's rather elaborate plotline is not easy to follow and it's somewhat slow-paced, so it really is a film that needs some thinking involved. It's not like Robin William's What Dreams May Come, it doesn't intend to please with visuals and conventional movie magics, but it tried to make Jon Voight(Eddie Maintenance)'s journey to be powerful morally, spiritually, and emotionally.Eddie is a maintenance worker at an amusement park called Ruby Pier, and one day he died when he got struck by one of the rides that had broken down. During his transition from Earth to Heaven, he meets five people, one at a time. Every one of the five people has something to teach him about some of the most significant events in his lifetime. The first person is the Blue Man played by Jeff Daniel, who was a freak at the Pier, and he had been involved with Eddie when he was living on Earth. The second person he meets is a fellow soldier. The third is the owner of the pier played by Ellen Burstyn. The fourth is his beloved departed wife, and the last is a girl who was his victim.The five people showed Eddie the truth about his life and what he should understand, forgive, and reconcile with. Basically, everything happened for a reason, and he must come to terms with all the good and bad events of his life before arriving Heaven....Jon Voight is brilliant in this movie, and he played his role from the age of 80's back to forty something in flasback sequences. He had delivered a multi-layered and moving performance as a man with a life filled with regret and remorse. Jeff Daniel is unrecognizable in heavy makeup, but he was the most striking of the Five People. Ellen Burstyn was good, but she had limited screentime and she did the narration for the film.
