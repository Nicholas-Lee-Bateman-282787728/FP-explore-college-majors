This set should have been the full season at about street price of  $42 or $21 the Vol. At about 800 min the season, there are other sets that came out a lot longer. Mission Impossible at $36 for 1314 min. WOW. I am getting the first season, both volumes. My wife loved the show and I liked it. This lets Paramount know there is a demand. Then I'll wait for a more reasonable price.  When the Second Season goes flat, Paramount will wonder why. If they stop making any more I'll have a season. (Look at how many 1st season only Universal has put out.) If they figure it out, we will have the rest at a better price. BBC and A&E; prices are outrageous. Remember Dr. Quinn? It came out at $80 to $100 and is now at $20 to $40. Patience gets the spoils. Paramount, a little unreasonable considering that half of their buyers are senior citizens. Ops, my retirement portfolio dropped another 5%. Where can I save? Duhhhhh! Leave It to Beaver 1040 min for $22. Father Knows Best 660 min for $30. Donna Reed show 960 min $30. Flying Nun 617 min $17 (It was higher when it first came out.) Yep, this one is too expensive considering Donna Reed is as good a show for half the cost. Now if we can get this listing URL to a studio executive.I know there is a less of a demand for every decade the releases go back, thus harder to make a profit. Two ways are volume/low pricing or pricing high/low volume. Paramount has selected on pricing high/low volume. The logic is better to sell 50k copies and make $20 per set then 100k copies and make $7 per set.But if they sell 150k copies they would make more. I think they could sell at least 3 times more on a more reasonable full season pricing. But what do we know?

Seems like this is starting to be a trend here on Amazon. People giving bad reviews on sets that are not due to be released for weeks or months. It seems there are some people out there that are hell bent on trying to ruin the enjoyment of collecting these wonderful old shows. And how sad it is that Amazon will allow this nonsense. I for one can not wait for this show to be released on DVD. And I really could care less about any small changes that ""may"" happen. Lets face it, releasing these old shows on DVD is not the main money maker for the studios producing them. I'm sure production could stop with no financial ruin to anyone involved. I'm wondering, has the world gotten so messed up that something as simple as purchasing a vintage TV show turns into a debate? Since I am a collector of most of the shows from the 50's and 60's I read the reviews posted by others. I believe in my heart and soul that some of the people think they are professionals in the field of movie and TV reviews and that their word is gospel. I'm sorry to say that many reviews just sound foolish. What it boils down to is this, people just need to mind their own business and Amazon needs take the first step in stopping poor reviews on DVDs that have not been released.

640172,A2MRDEXKMEFTJV,B00005JOEB,Nathan Laney,"[129, 138]","NOTE: I had originally written this review before I was aware that CBS/Paramount was altering their product through entire music score replacements and so on. As much as I love programs like ""My Three Sons,"" I can't see the justification for such decisions as split-season releases or soundtrack altering. My five-star rating was originally for the show, not the product, and it can not be changed. That being said:The color episodes of this show were good too, but the episodes we prefer to watch are the black & white episodes with Mike (Steve's oldest son) and Bub (the boys' grandfather - Steve's father-in-law). It was a very different show, with such plots as Steve's neighbor wanting to take a pleasant Sunday drive with his wife and daughter, but ending up hoodwinked into taking Steve's car and about a dozen others with them; or Bub losing Chip's frog that he was going to use for show and tell. There was an episode where Rob was reading detective novels and became convinced that someone was following him. Another episode had Mike taking an umbrella stand made from a hippopotamus foot to his fraternity house where they used it so as to make it appear as though a giant beast walked into a nearby lake and never came out. One episode took place on the morning that daylight saving time ended, and Bub turned the clocks ahead instead of back, forcing a tired crew to roll out 2 hours early. The whole episode was staged to the narration of a NASA public info film that Chip was watching on TV.Some of what makes these episodes important is the way we see Chip and Ernie develop a close friendship prior to the 1965 adoption episode. These earlier episodes make that particular one more weighty and understandable. Thank goodness for Nick at Nite back in the late 80's, because I had never seen the black & whites in re-runs before they ran them, nor have I seen them run again. Makes me glad I recorded them! However, DVD season sets would be a very welcome addition to my collection.UPDATE: JUNE 23, 2008. CBS/Paramount has confirmed a release date for this series. ""My Three Sons"" Season 1, Volume 1 will be released September 30, 2008.Update: July 2, 2008: The rear cover art for this series mentions music changes. To what extent? Who knows. It is particularly sad to hear of this happening in this series as Frank DeVol's music was essential to the feel, thus the flow of these shows. One example that quickly comes to mind is an episode that I believe is called ""The Horseless Saddle."" There are two pieces of music used at crucial points throughout the episode, it's necessary that they be there. The saddle has it's own music, and the pony has it's own music, and I don't recall ever hearing these two pieces used again.There's also an episode where Mike becomes very serious about a girl he's met in college. He tells Steve about her and arranges for her to come for dinner and meet the family. She immediately becomes infatuated with Steve (Talking about him when she's out with Mike, even comparing him with John Wayne while they're at the movies) and begins phoning him and creating situations that bring them together. Again, there is not only a particular piece of music used each time she gives Steve a ""look,"" but the same sound effect is also used and they really work well together.These shows without DeVol's music would be like a bun without a burger. Changing or deleting anything that's there would be a huge mistake!UPDATE: OCTOBER 1, 2008. Still waiting for a legitimate release.",5,Bring Us Bub!

640185,A3HLRBRF6SOJ5B,B00005JOEB,"tpm1800 ""tpm1800""","[13, 17]","I remember growing up watching the color episodes of ""My Three Sons"" and never really liking the show that much. It seemed very unrealistic and idealized to me. I especially disliked the very late shows when Fred MacMurray's character, Steve Douglas, got remarried and adopted that annoying little girl.When my family got Nick-At-Nite in the late 80s I recall seeing the early black and white episodes and being amazed. Those early shows were (IMHO) miles above the later shows. The characters were more realistically written and portrayed and the family situations reminded me more of my own childhood (coming from a family with two older brothers myself). The whole attitude of the early episodes was very much unlike other family sitcoms of that era. The Cleavers, Stones, Nelsons, etc., lived in tidy suburban perfection while the Douglas family's world was much rougher around the edges. The kids even kept their rooms messy like real boys would. I found myself hooked on the classic B&W; ""My Three Sons""!So, what made the early seasons so much better than the color shows? Well, for me it would have to be William Frawley as grandpa Bub. Yes, he is a bit cranky and short-tempered at times but you knew he loved the kids and would do anything for them. I really think he was the heart and soul of the early shows. It's also really kind of funny that old, crusty Bub took pride in being the ""woman of the house."" He earned that title by doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry and child rearing in the absence of Steve Douglas. I never really liked Uncle Charley in the later episodes. He just seemed too mean-spirited to me. Frawley had that gruff exterior but we always knew he was a real mush underneath.I also really enjoyed the dynamic between the original ""Three Sons."" I had never seen eldest son Mike before Nick-At-Nite's repeats. I really liked what he brought to the series. Middle son Robbie's jealousy of and rivalry with Mike was a very true-to-life aspect of the show as well. Robbie is quite goofy and awkward in the early seasons and often felt overshadowed by Mike, who seemed to excel at everything. Chip as a little kid was a lot of fun too.ABOUT THIS DVD RELEASE:First, the good news. The picture quality is outstanding. The images are crisp and clear and every bit as good as any quality DVD release of this era. Time wise the shows don't seem to be edited as they run about 26 minutes long.Now, the bad news. If you have read some of the other reviews or have researched this DVD release online you have, no doubt, read about the controversy surrounding the incidental music. I have no clue why CBS/Paramount would replace the music cues but I, like most fans, think it's a horrible decision. One of the things I vividly remember about seeing these on Nick-At-Nite was the background music. It was unlike anything else from it's time... very quirky and distinctive. Even stranger, as my online investigation revealed, episode one and episode three on this set contain the original scores. How'd they manage to use the original music cues for those two yet they couldn't (or wouldn't) on the other 15 episodes? I also wonder how, if it was a financial decision, it could have been cheaper to rescore these shows rather than use the original music. How expensive could 48 year-old background music be?The fact that CBS/Paramount is releasing half season sets bugs me too. If they didn't alter the music I could ignore this one but giving fans a half season of altered episodes at full season prices isn't fair.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you liked the color episodes of ""My Three Sons"" (and maybe even if you didn't) you'll probably enjoy the early shows. My buying advice would be to pick this set up if you are a fan as I doubt they will ever release it again and very likely will never get the whole series released.I'd give ""My Three Sons"" a full five stars but would give this release (because of the music and half season issues) only 3 stars.",3,"""My Three Sons"" DVD set one... a hit and a miss",1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,3966,"['remember', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'color', 'Three', 'Sons', 'never', 'really', 'liking', 'show', 'much', 'seemed', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'idealized', 'especially', 'disliked', 'very', 'late', 'shows', 'when', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'character', 'Steve', 'Douglas', 'got', 'remarried', 'adopted', 'annoying', 'little', 'girl.When', 'family', 'got', 'Nick-At-Nite', 'late', '80s', 'recall', 'seeing', 'early', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'being', 'amazed', 'early', 'shows', 'were', 'IMHO', 'miles', 'later', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'realistically', 'written', 'portrayed', 'family', 'situations', 'reminded', 'more', 'own', 'childhood', 'coming', 'family', 'two', 'older', 'brothers', 'whole', 'attitude', 'early', 'episodes', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'era', 'Cleavers', 'Stones', 'Nelsons', 'etc.', 'lived', 'tidy', 'suburban', 'perfection', 'Douglas', 'family', 'world', 'was', 'much', 'rougher', 'edges', 'kids', 'even', 'kept', 'rooms', 'messy', 'real', 'boys', 'would', 'found', 'hooked', 'classic', 'B', 'W', 'Three', 'Sons', 'So', 'what', 'made', 'early', 'seasons', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'color', 'Well', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'William', 'Frawley', 'grandpa', 'Bub', 'Yes', 'bit', 'cranky', 'short-tempered', 'times', 'knew', 'loved', 'kids', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'early', 'shows', 'also', 'really', 'kind', 'funny', 'old', 'crusty', 'Bub', 'took', 'pride', 'being', 'woman', 'house', 'earned', 'title', 'doing', 'cooking', 'cleaning', 'laundry', 'child', 'rearing', 'absence', 'Steve', 'Douglas', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Uncle', 'Charley', 'later', 'episodes', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'mean-spirited', 'Frawley', 'had', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'real', 'mush', 'underneath.I', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'dynamic', 'original', 'Three', 'Sons', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'eldest', 'son', 'Mike', 'Nick-At-Nite', 'repeats', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'brought', 'series', 'Middle', 'son', 'Robbie', 'jealousy', 'rivalry', 'Mike', 'was', 'very', 'true-to-life', 'aspect', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Robbie', 'quite', 'goofy', 'awkward', 'early', 'seasons', 'often', 'felt', 'overshadowed', 'Mike', 'who', 'seemed', 'excel', 'everything', 'Chip', 'little', 'kid', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'too.ABOUT', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'RELEASE', 'First', 'good', 'news', 'picture', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'images', 'are', 'crisp', 'clear', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'era', 'Time', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'edited', 'run', '26', 'minutes', 'long.Now', 'bad', 'news', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'researched', 'DVD', 'release', 'online', 'have', 'doubt', 'read', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'incidental', 'music', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'CBS/Paramount', 'would', 'replace', 'music', 'cues', 'most', 'fans', 'think', 'horrible', 'decision', 'One', 'things', 'vividly', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Nick-At-Nite', 'was', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'anything', 'else', 'time', 'very', 'quirky', 'distinctive', 'Even', 'stranger', 'online', 'investigation', 'revealed', 'episode', 'one', 'episode', 'three', 'set', 'contain', 'original', 'scores', 'How', ""'d"", 'manage', 'use', 'original', 'music', 'cues', 'two', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'other', '15', 'episodes', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'was', 'financial', 'decision', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cheaper', 'rescore', 'shows', 'rather', 'use', 'original', 'music', 'How', 'expensive', 'could', '48', 'year-old', 'background', 'music', 'be', 'fact', 'CBS/Paramount', 'releasing', 'half', 'season', 'sets', 'bugs', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'alter', 'music', 'could', 'ignore', 'one', 'giving', 'fans', 'half', 'season', 'altered', 'episodes', 'full', 'season', 'prices', ""n't"", 'fair.FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'liked', 'color', 'Three', 'Sons', 'maybe', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'early', 'shows', 'buying', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'pick', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'fan', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'release', 'again', 'very', 'likely', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'released.I', 'give', 'My', 'Three', 'Sons', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'give', 'release', 'music', 'half', 'season', 'issues', 'only', '3', 'stars']",N/A
