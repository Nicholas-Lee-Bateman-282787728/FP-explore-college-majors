I think they fell short.1-intense. this wasn't exactly  a war movie or a psychological thriller, so no.2-spectacular-yes-there were some great visuals and neat ideas.3-ground breaking. no. while the movie was very pretty and  very full of  great science stuff, there wasn't anything going on I haven't seen before.4-visually stunning-yes. this movie was full of &#34;lord of the rings&#34; worthy graphics with the awesome epic scale back drops and what not. it is very beautiful for many scenes and is pretty for  stretches sometimes adding to the overall entertainment and artistic value.5- mind blowing-no. it takes a lot to really blow a mind. while there are a lot of unexpected things going on. i'd call it more ironic than mind blowing. there were a few places that made me go, &#34;whooooooaaaahhhhh, dude!&#34; but no mind blowing.the cover also says he will &#34;question everything he knows&#34;. that is true.so I was waiting for a big ending like say any of these movies....&#34;planet of the apes&#34;, &#34;total recall&#34;, &#34;matrix revelutions &#34;  &#34;death race 2000&#34;, &#34;1984&#34; , &#34;a midsummers night dream&#34;, &#34;2001: a space odyssey&#34; or &#34;fight club&#34;. of course, I cant tell so you will just have to watch. its worth it.,this is morgan freemans third movie I know of where he gets to be a  great mind. the others are Lucius fox from the second batman trilogy and  when he played  GOD  in &#34; bruce almighty&#34;.  this character is Morpheus like. Morpheus is the black guy in the &#34;matrix&#34; movies.on the cover, it says that tom cruise finds a beautiful stranger. the chick he's already with was very  very pretty. she had a nice body, not trashy, but nice. she had really pretty eyes and a heart melting smile. what did he even need this new woman for ? someone was mixed up there. I did not like that part.this movie is about a guy who can pilot spacecrafts in a post apocalyptic earth.

1557918,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008JFUO36,Ace Reader,"[1, 3]","American actor Tom Cruise plays character Commander Jack Harper. Jack lives solely to repair flying drones that hunt down and terminate all alien life forms remaining on planet earth after an attack and war with them that has left our planet mostly scorched. Jack isn't alone with his quest. Living with him in his perfect high-rise in the sky is beautiful Victoria played by (for me newcomer), English actress Andrea Riseborough. She is his companion and helpmate to keep the drones flying and in working order. Victoria loves Jack. They make an effective team.Tom Cruise's acting and that of the entire cast (including American actor Morgan Freeman and Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), is excellent, compelling and solid. ""Oblivion's"" cinematography by Claudio Miranda is gorgeous with beautifully filmed surreal landscapes. It wow's you with excellent special effects, including scary flying terminator drones and Jack's really cool personal spaceship. All interior scenes of a devastated past world are expertly created by art director Ronald Reiss. Because of this ""Oblivion"" has a believable feel to it at all times.""Oblivion's"" story line is the best part about this film. On it's surface it appears as a flashy Sci-Fi film. But it's much more then that. It's a deeply thought provoking tale about obsession, love and loss, fear and longing, lies and deceit, and cellular memory. At it's core ""Oblivion"" is a human drama about humanity and the essence of who and what we are. Questions about mans eternal soul came into question while I was watching this film. I enjoyed this refreshing brain tickler for a change from all the heavy action films that have been out of late. ""Oblivion"" at it's heart a love story. It's quality is higher.As many people know, all good stories have already been told. Now it's up to today's writers to find new ways to re-wright these stories. To re-package and present them to us as freshened up new stories. I think writers (Michael Arndt, Joseph Kosinski and William Monahan), did a fine job repackaging many previously used ideas in this screenplay. ""Oblivion"" is based on an ""unpublished"" graphic novel by the same name by Joseph Kosinski.Parts of this story were for me predictable, but a lot was not. Sometimes it's okay to think you've figured things out in a story. To believe just for a moment that you might know what will happen next within the plot line. Then be right enjoying the satisfaction of seeing your guess unfold before yours eyes just the way you were hoping it would. Or like with me being totally wrong in my guess and loving my mistake. ""Oblivion"" has a few surprises too.Also, I love ""Oblivion's"" beautiful original Motion Picture soundtrack. It is co-composed by Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese. Susanne Sundfor of M.8.3. preforms it's hauntingly beautiful theme song.You won't be bored in this film. I have now seen it twice, and the second time was even better then the first. I highly recommend this film to all Science Fiction Fans. You will enjoy this one.

Tom Cruise gives a standard, decent performance, and everyone else is fine.  He's of course far too old for his work/love partner in the movie, but that's standard Hollywood protocol.

Morgan Freeman, despite earning a spot on the poster/cover, has a very small role.Everything looks great, the movie moves along at a pretty brisk pace, the twist isn't exactly jaw-dropping, but it provides something to do in the last third of the story. (if you've ready any amount of scifi short stories or pulp novels from the 60s - 80s that owe any kind of debt to Ray Bradbury or The Twilight Zone then the twist feels very standard, but I don't hold that against them).

Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in.

If there is one major fault with Oblivion its that there is a sense that it draws far too much on past Sci-fi movies (I found myself comparing particular scenes with previous movies - some now quite dated - and such reminicising drew me away from the premise of the movie itself) with the ending (no-spoiler here) pretty well much a re-make of a well known, but now quite aged, sci-fi movie (and thus a real dissapointment).Oblivion is an enticing journey into a post (dare I say) apocalyptic earth where mankind has truimphed over an alien invasion and Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is left behind with his 'partner' as a cleanup/srvice 'mechanic' of giant sea converters. I am not a particular fan of Tom Cruise however here he harks back to his better days of acting and carries this film with a degree of aplom. Like other reviews here, I agree that there is far too little exposure of humans and how they have coped with life in this new earth and much more could have been done to explore this aspect, furthermore I was very dissapointed at the 'Alien' content and the ending of the film reinforced this, as in how they, the aliens, were portrayed.Oblivion started well, built at an excellent rate, maintained my interest - and then suddenly fell completely on its face at the end :( (hence only 3 stars and 2.5 of them are for the CGI and the futuristic technology).

1557985,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B008JFUO36,Anthony L.,"[3, 3]","Let me first say that I thought directorJoseph Kosinski'sTron: Legacy was abysmal. And apparently, a sizable portion of critics and audiences shared my opinion. But there were moments watching that I could not help but be impressed. Kosinski has a great visual eye, and shows mastery of lighting and framing. There are scenes in the film of startling beauty, like, ""Wow. This movie is actually not ALL bad."" Colour me intrigued. What else could this guy do?When he was coupled with arguably Hollywood's biggest movie star -Tom Cruise, a great supporting cast - includingMorgan FreemanandOlga Kurylenko, a bigger budget, and a promising script based on a six-page graphic novel treatment he penned, I was ready to give Joseph Kosinski a second chance.I saw Oblivion. Let's see what I thought below.Movies live or die on their casting so let's talk about that first. I understand the doubts about Tom Cruise, but really, there's no need for that. Put aside your thoughts about his personal life; the couch jumping, Katie Holmes, and all that. The role of futuristic drone repairman Jack Harper is quite possibly among his finest. Cruise shows he has a real screen presence, which, when combined with his roguish charm and charisma, results in a surprisingly sympathetic and impressive performance.Cruise's character is onscreen 90% of the time, so his performance is a big factor in the film's power. I can safely say that Jack Harper managed to be interesting, cool, and emotional without being over-the-top or sappy. Kudos to you, Tom. You might not be the finest of actors, but you're always fun to watch.Olga Kurylenko andAndrea Riseboroughboth give excellent performances as the films two female leads: respectively, the mysterious crash-landed astronaut Julia, and Jack's conflicted co-member Victoria. While Kurylenko's character brings the love interest and the mysterious flashbacks, Riseborough's Victoria is much more interesting and strong, plotwise. in the supporting cast we find Morgan Freeman, who is his usual awesome self as Malcolm Beech, one of the few remaining humans on earth; andNikolai Coster-Waldau, who brings the muscle and the beard factor to the game. Fine roles, all round!And here's another reason to watch Oblivion. Oblivion has the finest cinematography I have seen in a film this year. Echoing Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, the stunning landscape of Iceland comes to vivid, awe-inspiring life with a minimum of CGI and a maximum of practical effects, camera tricks, and good ol'fashioned location shooting. Crumbling volcanos, vast mesas, winding canyons, valleys, endless plains, shifting deserts, dizzying peaks, and open sky are all beautifully shot, and, with a bit of CGI touch-up, become the alien-ravaged world of 2077. Seriously, see this in IMAX and you will not be disappointed. Oblivion is a veritable FEAST for the eyes.The costumes and tech and equipment are amazing as well. Kosinski chose to go for a more practical route here, and the extra work pays off. The world of Oblivion reminds one of an Apple Computer or theStar Trek (2009), but there are telltale signs that this is a lived-in, breathed-in, realistic world. Jack Harper's white costumes bears stains and grit; his chrome gun is scratched a little bit; his baseball cap is faded. Malcolm Beech's leathers are functional and weathered, while the garb of astronaut Julia is pristine grey and follows the clean lines of NASA. Form follows function, as Oblivion designer David Simon says, and so Oblivion's equipment - the drones, the planes, the guns, the motorcycles, the clothes, the beds, the electronics, even the sound of the tech, is all designed for maximum realism. But that's not to say it doesn't look cool. It does.I applaud Joseph Kosinski for his restraint when it came to CGI, and his use of practical sets and props. Here's to more in the future.Now, shall we talk cons? Oblivion borrows from too many movies to list. I see a bit of Moon here, Logan's Run there, a little of Star Wars there, is that a Solaris reference I spy? As original as Oblivion may seem, it may all be superficial - just on the surface. The story has been done plenty of times before, just not with this incredible cinematography and eye for detail. The climax was slightly ""out there"", and didn't reeeally fit the rest of the film tonally, but Tom Cruise's memorable one-liner is enough to make it worth it all.In conclusion, Oblivion is one of the best science fiction films to come out this year. But it's a good thing not many sci-fi films DID come out in 2013, because Oblivion is not as epic or original as it might want to be. That's not to stop the great acting, explosive action, great sets, costumes, and cool tech, and cool M83 score from letting you have a great time at the movies. My rating? Four and a half drones out of five. But why don't you watch it and see for yourself?P.S.

1557988,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B008JFUO36,Argyle Ronin,"[1, 5]","The best of standalone Tom Cruise has all been sci-fi in the last 10 years. Think about it. Ignore MI, which is a franchise. Now we are left with a string of hit-or-miss movies featuring old man Cruise struggling to look 25 after thousands of dollars invested in plastic surgery. Starting with Minority Report and continuing with War of the Worlds, Cruise has evolved into a sci-fi icon of sorts, very much like latter-day Charlton Heston. With Oblivion, which is essentially Top Gun plus 100 years of high-tech breakthroughs, the actor has come full circle.The SFX are what you would expect from a movie with a $120M budget and two A-list stars. A visually stunning earth home that sits right above the clouds is where most of the melodrama takes place. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and surrogate wife Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) exchange smooches, awkward glances, and plenty of scenery chewing dialogue before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) intrudes to form one dysfunctional love triangle. At this point, I could only hope that Jack would throw Victoria off the side of their home in a sort of futuristic nod to Captain Stabbin, but the soon-to-be ex-surrogate wife is dispatched via droid instead.Gaping logical flaws abound. Again, the home that is the setting for 2/3 of this film is situated above the clouds. With no guard rails. What if a strong gust of wind came and dragged one of the main characters off of the improbable structure? Also, I am pretty sure that in the next century, Earth's Stratosphere will still be pretty freaking cold! The surrogate couple swim around butt naked in their attached pool, while the accompanying outdoor temperature is likely below -60*F. Ice skating in Eskimo gear would be more reasonable.There is some business with clones that I could not understand. Morgan Freeman fails to impress. Olga keeps her shirt on. Combine Moon and Prometheus and you will arrive at Oblivion, which is ultimately too milquetoast to leave a lasting impression. This is ""conservative"" sci-fi. Nice haircuts, just-ironed uniforms, and staunch patriotism give off a Jetsons vibe.

This was really a very intelligent and well done Sci-Fi Affair . No, it wasn't a action movie and I loved the fact it wasn't. In Fact it was a very intelligent complex well written story. I thought Tom Cruise's perfomance was one of the best he's had in along time. He actually had emotion and did seem vunerable and unsure of himself. I think any person that is intelligent and like challenging stories should see this. What it basically comes down too everything he knows is wrong. And why is everything in the state that it is in today is one big question. But as the movie progresses it give us all the answers we are looking for. The film isn't set up in a heroic type nature or action adventure type. Its about a man that is a technician and honestly just has bad days at work. And his quest to find the truth and to deal with the situations as they come up. Which is a rare style in this day in age for cinema. M83 did a great job with the music score it brought the film out. Instead of just playing as background music like most films. The score made the scenes more emotional and important. The visuals were astonishing and very uniquie like a tron or ridley scott affair. Joseph has his own style like Ridley Scott which is rare in the industy of todays american cinema.

1557994,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B008JFUO36,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[2, 5]","Oblivion is undoubtedly a ""homage"" film.  This doesn't necessarily have to be considered a bad thing.  While it certainly is lacking in the originality department, it more than makes up for that with the enthusiasm it has for the movies it borrows from - specifically, late `60's and `70's sci-fi.  After the cheesiness and saccharine of the `50's, sci-fi took a side path into journeys of discovery and pondered the mysteries of the universe.  Film's of the time - notably 2001: A Space Odyssey - were less about action or horror and more about capturing the public emotion present in the years after the first man landed on the moon.Oblivion captures that spirit perfectly.  Considering it takes place on the ruined planet Earth, this is no mean feat.  That the film doesn't focus on the wreckage of humanity, but the wonder of what's been preserved goes a long way to keeping the focus on the wonder of the universe.  The color pallet is saturated with sunlight, a stark contrast to more dark and grimy post-Alien era of sci-fi films (the recent Prometheus comes to mind).  The architecture is cleanly designed - clearly, Apple Corporation's visual sensibilities will stay with us until 2077. All this serves to create a world that wants to be viewed and explored - not hostile and alien, but familiar and welcoming.Everyone will identify with Jack Harper, then, when he feels reluctant to leave.  Harper (played by Tom Cruise) is a maintenance tech on the vast structures that siphon water and useful materials from the barren rock that was once the planet.  He and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are only two weeks from being able to pack up and leave to rejoin what remains of humanity on the ""Tet"", a sort of interplanetary ark.  Evidently, although the human race won the battle against whatever alien race menaced it, it left the planet totally unusable.  While Victoria is eagerly awaiting their call to leave, Jack is not so sure, his hesitance prompted by his discovery of a small oasis hidden in a mountain range that he frequently spends the night at against Command's orders.Amidst Victoria's feeble reassurances to Command that they are both still an ""effective team"", there is sense of something wrong.  Jack has continual flashbacks to a time before the world ended (a time he should not have been alive to see) all involving a mysterious woman.  As sci-fi tropes demand, as Jack is out on a maintenance run, an unidentified ship crash lands near him, and he finds her body in stasis in the wreckage.  Needless to say, not all is as it seems, and Jack's position slowly begins to unravel as he finds out he has been misled.No, it's not exactly original, but sometimes originality isn't necessary.  Oblivion walks in the path left behind by previous cinema heavyweights, but it does so with a vigor and pace that keeps the audience engaged, even when we see the twist coming miles away.  There are a few weak spots - while Cruise does a good job acting, his lines are often comically stilted.  There's a slight cheese factor here.  More demanding science fiction aficionados will find a great deal of plot holes as well, although many are closed up before the film's end.  Let's just say a lot of things aren't supposed to make sense at first.Setting that aside, Oblivion is a movie that does its predecessors proud.

But you know what, ""Tom cruise only does A movies and he pours his soul into everything he does"".  I'm glad I purchased this movie and in blu ray, it's worthy of the blu ray treatment and it merits being in my collection.PROS-Strong actors (I don't just mean Tom but, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Memissa Leo -- they were all fantastic actors in this)-Strong characters-Storyline that keeps giving-Cool concept-It's got Tom cruise (I'm one of those people that don't want to like Tom just because every second of his real-life life is examined under a microscope and marketed to the ends of the world...in end I do like the actor....he's a talented hardworking actor and deserves the A listing)  This movie brought me back to respecting the actor.-Good character development (even the minor characters have a depth to them like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who only gets a few minutes on camera but wow does he make the best of them! And Victoria, wow, she and Tom have to carry a good third of the movie alone and together so she does a tremendous job here -- best supporting comes to mind.)CONSNoneNo spoilers here.  You really have to watch the movie. The aliens invade, we push them back, Tom cruise is some kind of drone repair guy.Are there unanswered questions in the Movie?....yes most certainly but the movie is very good at helping you suspend disbelief with its strong visual portrayal, sound, strong acting.  To me two phrases are very important in sci fi: rational acting and plausible reality ---- Are the actors doing rational things in the movie?  YES (If you're ask yourself during a movie, ""why did he do that? that's dumb! Then the actors are not acting rationally)- Is the story plausible?  YES (it's science fiction but yes it's plausible and yes you have to suspend disbelief just a bit)Some have compared this movie to Prometheus, a science fiction ""mess of a movie"" and it takes a lot for a guy like me to hang such a label on a movie....in Prometheus the actors are not doing rational things and the story is not really plausible (it makes no sense, the plot is not rational).  So it is categorically unfair to compare these two movies simply because both of their opening sequences are ""pretty"" in the visual sense.Oblivion's actors by contrast are strong rational, a tight story & plot that keeps giving (and the story is plausible), that is a huge difference --- couple that with Tom Cruise and the Cast's strong acting & beautiful filming and you have quite literally a masterpiece of science fiction.One final thing, some people critique that they figured it out pretty fast but I sincerely don't think the movie is meant to keep anything secret from the audience, a la sixth sense, I think it's a journey of discovery for Tom Cruise's character.  He's the one figuring things out.

They are not identical, but their premises are oblique - which is not meant as criticism as much as its meant as comparison. Where one features a presumed man isolated on a mining base on the moon, the other posits a presumed man on earth following an alien invasion. Both have memories of people and situations in the past which they can't quite identify. Both come to confront replicas of their own physical beings. Both discover that they are androids. Both ""sets"" of androids die. Etc. Their are other, rather fundamental differences. Oblivion's Hans Zimmer-like score is maddening and distracting in the extreme. As usual, where this kind of thing is concerned, the minimalism in the music should not be the pounding, ostinato-driven repetition - but the MINIMAL use of music so as to ENHANCE its effect when its presence is required. When the score is nothing but another layer of unchanging sound, it ceases to be music and becomes noise -  it destroys, utterly, the purpose and real magic of music. Moon is much more recondite in its use of music. All this said, the best comparison of the two films would be by way of musical simile: where Moon is like chamber music (small in scope - restricted in range), Oblivion is operatic. Both are fine in their own ways - and, my objections to the score for Oblivion notwithstanding, both films work in their own, distinctive ways.",4,Oblivion vs Moon,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,1518,"[""'ll"", 'make', 'short', 'sweet', 'similarities', 'plot', 'devices', 'parallels', 'Oblivion', 'Moon', '2009', 'struck', 'immediately', 'are', 'not', 'identical', 'premises', 'are', 'oblique', 'not', 'meant', 'as', 'criticism', 'as', 'much', 'meant', 'comparison', 'Where', 'one', 'presumed', 'man', 'isolated', 'mining', 'base', 'moon', 'other', 'presumed', 'man', 'earth', 'following', 'alien', 'invasion', 'have', 'memories', 'people', 'situations', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'identify', 'come', 'confront', 'replicas', 'own', 'physical', 'beings', 'discover', 'are', 'androids', 'sets', 'androids', 'die', 'Etc', 'are', 'other', 'rather', 'fundamental', 'differences', 'Oblivion', 'Hans', 'Zimmer-like', 'score', 'maddening', 'distracting', 'extreme', 'usual', 'where', 'kind', 'thing', 'concerned', 'minimalism', 'music', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'pounding', 'ostinato-driven', 'repetition', 'MINIMAL', 'use', 'music', 'so', 'ENHANCE', 'effect', 'when', 'presence', 'required', 'When', 'score', 'nothing', 'layer', 'unchanging', 'sound', 'be', 'music', 'noise', 'utterly', 'purpose', 'real', 'magic', 'music', 'Moon', 'much', 'more', 'recondite', 'use', 'music', 'said', 'best', 'comparison', 'two', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'musical', 'simile', 'where', 'Moon', 'chamber', 'music', 'small', 'scope', 'restricted', 'range', 'Oblivion', 'operatic', 'are', 'fine', 'own', 'ways', 'objections', 'score', 'Oblivion', 'notwithstanding', 'films', 'work', 'own', 'distinctive', 'ways']",N/A

1558016,A34X20QSBGEMTC,B008JFUO36,B. by the Water,"[3, 10]","I did not like this film. It was disorganized, very confusing, bad writing. One should not have to watch it more than once to try to uderstand it better. I really respect and enjoy these actors, Cruise, Freeman, but just not in this film. In this film they are tru heros with heart, but if I may, there was at least one segment where Freeman's character goes on a long speech like talk, solo, and all cast remain quiet as a mouse. I thought, this character is full of himself and likes hearing himself talk. It was similar to listening to him narrate a documentary. The producers should have cut that piece out to make him more likeable. The brunette actres, Olga, is so very pretty, her face and hair especially in this one, but she had very few words, it left me thinking perhaps she needs to work on her acting skills. In another film she played a silent warrior woman, I forget the title, it was pre middle ages timeline, she starred with Michael Fastbender, she nailed that role, great acting despite no words. She was good in that Bond film too. The plot in this Oblivion film to me was poorly done, too hard to follow, you had to work hard to understand, leaving you tired, with headache, wondering if this was a time and money waste to watch. In fact, on several occasions I often thought the film was about to end and it appeared to be winding down, and also it was dull, I think I was hoping it would end, it dragged on and on. If I knew what it was like, I would not have seen it even if for free. There was only one segment I liked, when Cruise was driving a small aircraft and was being chased by other craft, there was shooting between them, that was very exicting, but ended with an impossible scenario leaving me as a viewer insulted by the writers. The two main female characters were very easy on the eyes. Oh, and to top off the not so good on this film, was a silly female character with a southern accent which sounded very fake. She was somewhat of a manager role, wizard like, only seen on a tiny screen, calling the shots, but very unlikable, worse acting; again, if this film is very futuristic, it made you think, since in this film, earth is not the earth we once knew, then how in the world can one develop a southern accent if there is no such thing as the south; in fact, no East Coast community, no accents at all, because it is not the same USA or world for that matter. Someone else wrote, ""there is an explanation for that 'female wizard TV monitor screen bossy character', I thought, there should not be an explanation, we should get it, the first time. However I agreed, there is probably and explanation for everything in this film, but why bother, I do not want to dream up or think or create a book a story in my head while I watch it, if I did I would be a writer, instead I thought i would see this film for entertainment, that did not happen. There seemed to have been segments cut which left you with more questions that answers. It gets worse, the film seems to go back and forth in time so often, there is even a double or twin of one character, how did that happen?; so you need to figure that out too. You need to figure this out, that out, etc. and so on and so on. Such so it leaves your headache feel like your brain is being blown apart into "" oblivion."" So at least they picked a perfect title. I am still stunned and I am ashamed to admit to anyone that I saw this movie. I think I need to keep this secret to myself. Buyer, beware.

1558018,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008JFUO36,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","What makes Oblivion stand out to me is that it doesn't really focus entirely on laser beams shooting everywhere and several elements of hard-to-follow suspense and excitement like you'd typically find in such science fiction movies that deal with the destruction/deterioration of planet Earth.  Instead these particular type of segments only occurs occasionally.  In its place lies segments involving drama concerning Tom Cruise's wife from 60 years prior found frozen in a capsule, and how she wakes up to find the world in its current state which is practically in ruins due to an alien invasion being the reason.  Tom Cruise of course is the man who's expected to save planet Earth!  Who else to play that role, right?While the occasional segments showing space crafts flying everywhere are certainly interesting and comparable to what you've seen countless times in similar science fiction movies, the storyline itself is rather confusing to figure out.  The doppelganger Tom Cruise that appears later on is when I finally got *completely* lost.  Also when Tom Cruise returns to his base and his current girlfriend (or wife- the redheaded chick) doesn't acknowledge the fight between her and Cruise that *just* took place a few minutes earlier apparently either because her memory went out or a change in time occurred without acknowledgement at some point.  Never could figure out which one truthfully.Morgan Freeman is a fantastic actor in his role as a deep-voiced leader, Olga Kurylenko is ridiculously cute as one would expect (but exceptionally cuter here!) and so is Andrea Riseborough.  Despite the confusing storyline and never knowing what's really happening on screen, one area where the movie truly exceeds is in the visuals.  Despite millions of people having been killed years earlier and the destruction of several famous structures and landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, it all comes across appearing remarkably pretty and appealing oddly enough (especially the forest area that Tom would sometimes visit while listening to Led Zeppelin and Procol Harum, rock bands truly deserving of their classic status!)Overall, pretty awesome film, but expect to sit through a fair amount of drama and even romance which is more of a focus than anything else.",4,not your ordinary science fiction film,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2274,"['What', 'Oblivion', 'stand', 'out', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'entirely', 'laser', 'beams', 'shooting', 'everywhere', 'several', 'elements', 'hard-to-follow', 'suspense', 'excitement', ""'d"", 'typically', 'find', 'such', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'deal', 'destruction/deterioration', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Instead', 'particular', 'type', 'segments', 'only', 'occasionally', 'place', 'segments', 'involving', 'drama', 'concerning', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'wife', '60', 'years', 'prior', 'found', 'frozen', 'capsule', 'how', 'up', 'find', 'world', 'current', 'state', 'practically', 'ruins', 'due', 'alien', 'invasion', 'being', 'reason', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'course', 'man', 'who', 'expected', 'save', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Who', 'else', 'play', 'role', 'right', 'occasional', 'segments', 'showing', 'space', 'crafts', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'are', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'comparable', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'similar', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'storyline', 'rather', 'confusing', 'figure', 'out', 'doppelganger', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'later', 'when', 'finally', 'got', '*completely*', 'lost', 'Also', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'base', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'wife-', 'redheaded', 'chick', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'fight', 'Cruise', '*just*', 'took', 'place', 'few', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'apparently', 'either', 'memory', 'went', 'out', 'change', 'time', 'occurred', 'acknowledgement', 'point', 'Never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'truthfully.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'role', 'deep-voiced', 'leader', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'ridiculously', 'cute', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'exceptionally', 'cuter', 'here', 'so', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'never', 'knowing', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'screen', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'movie', 'truly', 'visuals', 'millions', 'people', 'having', 'been', 'killed', 'years', 'earlier', 'destruction', 'several', 'famous', 'structures', 'landmarks', 'such', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'across', 'appearing', 'remarkably', 'pretty', 'appealing', 'oddly', 'enough', 'especially', 'forest', 'area', 'Tom', 'would', 'sometimes', 'visit', 'listening', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'rock', 'bands', 'truly', 'deserving', 'classic', 'status', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'film', 'expect', 'sit', 'fair', 'amount', 'drama', 'even', 'romance', 'more', 'focus', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

More than 10 sci fi films were released, all with great potential to be be top-notch.To be 100% honest, I didn't have high hopes for Oblivion if only because the other films looked so strong by comparison. Oblivion exceeded my expectations and then some.I won't go into the storyline as many other reviewers already have. I will say that yes, certain elements are derivitive. There are parts of Independence Day, The Matrix and other (rather good btw) sci fi stories in the plot of Oblivion. However, at no point did I feel that any other film was being ""ripped-off"". Oblivion has enough of it's own original ideas and variation of classic themes to make it stand on it's own. New and old ideas both come together and make a rather satisfying film.Tom Cruise is solid here as is Morgan Freeman (is he ever in a bad movie?). The rest of the cast - especially Andrea Riseborough - are both believable and relatable. I especially enjoyed Melissa Leo as ""Sally"".

They emphasized the scene in the library which made this movie look just like any of dozens of pseudo sci-fi ""fight the monsters in the dark"" films. I've enjoyed some films of that type but after 30+ years they've worn thin by now.Just for the heck of it, my wife and I just watched this on streaming video and found a VERY different film than expected. With a few action scenes worked in here and there, this is actually a very thoughtful and surprising post-apocalyptic sci-fi story.Set about 70 years in the future, the Earth has reportedly won a war with alien invaders by resorting to the nuclear option. The relatively few people left have abandoned Earth to live on Titan (a large moon of Jupiter), and the few people left hanging around are protecting large machines that are generating needed power for the colony by sucking up the Earth's oceans.Tom Cruise plays Jack, one of these survivors whose job is to repair weaponized drones which protect the power generating machines. Along with a female partner, they spend their nights in a luxurious base and their days working to find and repair drones downed by the remnants of the invading army.The surprises in this film won't be shocking for highly experienced sci-fi fans, but their gradual revelation makes for a very intriguing and very thoughtful story. Jack's increasing self-awareness and his struggle to arrive at the truth is a fascinating story which is 180 degrees different than the movie suggested by the ads ... and trust me that's a GOOD thing! :-)Well, any more than this and I'd be getting to spoiler territory ... as if there likely aren't hundreds of reviews with spoilers out there anyway.

1558059,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008JFUO36,Brian Driver,"[3, 4]","(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)First: DO NOT READ Amazon's description of OBLIVION!  It gives away key PLOT SPOILERS.For my part, I will quite deliberately tell you only a little about the plot, as I think it really is best kept as a surprise. Thankfully, the commercials do not do it an injustice, and will not spoil your viewing.The merest details of the story are as follows: Jack Harper (Cruise) is a repairman known as Tech 49 whose assignment is providing security in order to keep Hydrorig machinery running on what's left of our planet after a ravaging horde of aliens destroyed almost our entire race six decades ago.  Alien scavengers are sabotaging the rigs on a daily basis, and all Jack and his partner are hoping for is to finish their job and join the remainder of Earth's survivors on Titan, a moon of Saturn.As for anything else, it's best you keep your mind clear until you see the movie.The acting is very competent and while not entirely engaging, it doesn't have to be: the movie aims for a deliberate aloofness here. And, though the movie has Cruise in almost every shot it is not a typical star turn for him.  For once Cruise has selected a movie that features him but is not ABOUT him, in a sense...it's about what secret lies behind their strange day-to-day existences.Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace) and Andrea Riseborough (Brighton Rock) are excellent, as is Melissa Leo (Flight,Olympus Has Fallen).  While Morgan Freeman is featured prominently in the ads, he does not play a large role in the film...though it is pivotal.OBLIVION is an interesting mix...lots of action, yet it tries to be a thinker. As such, it does provide a puzzle that needs to be put together by the viewer. The real, ultimate problem is that once that's accomplished there isn't a lot there to ponder afterward.  There's a twist, yes; it just isn't all that intellectual. ThinkPlanet Of The Apes (1968)without the BIG shock.What OBLIVION does really well is look good. It superimposes post-apocalytic scenes of desecrated New York landmarks upon a desolate landscape laid waste by enemy invaders. Shot in Iceland during their 24-hour cycles of daylight, the juxtaposition makes for a stark composition of collapse and ruination...an earth no longer even worth inhabiting.As always, the desolation is New York City's: the Manhattan (or is it Brooklyn?) Bridge juts out of the silt, in the midst of a rocky crag there is an entrance to a big interior room of the New York Public Library, the Empire State Building appears only from the observation tower on up, and a big football stadium (is it the Met Life Stadium?) lies in ruins.What director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life Of Pi) accomplish is to produce the devastation of Earth through the browns, blacks, and greys of the soil and rocks, counterpointed by the bright blueness of the ever-present sky. There is a gorgeous iridescent blue and black night swimming scene in Jack's sky suite, wherein the two actors swim tastefully naked inside a transparent pool. Indeed, Cruise's silver-blue uniform and his clear glass bubble-like helicopter are sleek and artistically interposed in this world of greys, blues and browns. When they travel into space, it is primarily dark and black. When he is trapped within the hidden caverns of his enemy it is a dark, shadowy world of blacks, greys, and browns.There is only one place in this whole movie that really displays color, and it is a hideaway Jack  has created for himself in what one can only assume is New York's Adirondacks -- though these scenes were shot in California. It's a little hamlet of lush greenery that has within it a cabin of artifacts Jack's lifted upon his trips around the ruins of NYC. He has tucked away books, Procul Harum and Led Zeppelin albums, a doll, and photos near and dear to him. The audience at my showing had a little chuckle at the fact that he places on one shelf his own iconic sunglasses...to my way of thinking, the trademark of one Mr. ""Top Gun"" Cruise.So the film is strikingly visual, and a beauty to see at the theater. I saw it in an IMAX theater (though it was not shot that way) and it was gorgeous. Besides that, the soundtrack by French band M83 is also alternately pensive and rousing, peacefully employing a lone piano one moment, then next dishing up an insistent orchestral piece.All in all, OBLIVION is a beautiful, striking, thoughtful work, though it doesn't -- as perennial one-year old genius Stewie Griffin might say -- ""leave us richer for the experience.""",4,"Visually Arresting, But Not Quite the Thinker It Hopes To Be",1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,4641,"['NOTE', 'anyone', 'who', 'give', 'negative', 'review', 'please', 'leave', 'comment', 'help', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'First', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'Amazon', 'description', 'OBLIVION', 'away', 'key', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERS.For', 'part', 'will', 'quite', 'deliberately', 'tell', 'only', 'little', 'plot', 'think', 'really', 'best', 'kept', 'surprise', 'Thankfully', 'commercials', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'injustice', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'viewing.The', 'merest', 'details', 'story', 'are', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'Cruise', 'repairman', 'known', 'Tech', '49', 'assignment', 'providing', 'security', 'order', 'keep', 'Hydrorig', 'machinery', 'running', 'what', 'left', 'planet', 'ravaging', 'horde', 'aliens', 'destroyed', 'almost', 'entire', 'race', 'six', 'decades', 'ago', 'Alien', 'scavengers', 'are', 'sabotaging', 'rigs', 'daily', 'basis', 'Jack', 'partner', 'are', 'hoping', 'finish', 'job', 'join', 'remainder', 'Earth', 'survivors', 'Titan', 'moon', 'Saturn.As', 'anything', 'else', 'best', 'keep', 'mind', 'clear', 'see', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'very', 'competent', 'not', 'entirely', 'engaging', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'movie', 'deliberate', 'aloofness', 'here', 'movie', 'Cruise', 'almost', 'shot', 'not', 'typical', 'star', 'turn', 'once', 'Cruise', 'selected', 'movie', 'not', 'ABOUT', 'sense', 'what', 'secret', 'strange', 'day-to-day', 'existences.Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'are', 'excellent', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Flight', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'featured', 'prominently', 'ads', 'not', 'play', 'large', 'role', 'film', 'pivotal.OBLIVION', 'interesting', 'mix', 'lots', 'action', 'be', 'thinker', 'such', 'provide', 'puzzle', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'viewer', 'real', 'ultimate', 'problem', 'once', 'accomplished', ""n't"", 'lot', 'there', 'ponder', 'afterward', 'twist', 'yes', 'just', ""n't"", 'intellectual', 'ThinkPlanet', 'Apes', '1968', 'BIG', 'shock.What', 'OBLIVION', 'really', 'well', 'look', 'good', 'post-apocalytic', 'scenes', 'desecrated', 'New', 'York', 'desolate', 'landscape', 'laid', 'waste', 'enemy', 'invaders', 'Shot', 'Iceland', '24-hour', 'cycles', 'daylight', 'juxtaposition', 'stark', 'composition', 'collapse', 'ruination', 'earth', 'no', 'longer', 'even', 'worth', 'inhabiting.As', 'always', 'desolation', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Manhattan', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'silt', 'midst', 'rocky', 'crag', 'entrance', 'big', 'interior', 'room', 'New', 'York', 'Public', 'Library', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'only', 'observation', 'tower', 'big', 'football', 'stadium', 'Met', 'Life', 'Stadium', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'Claudio', 'Miranda', 'Life', 'Pi', 'accomplish', 'produce', 'devastation', 'Earth', 'browns', 'blacks', 'greys', 'soil', 'rocks', 'counterpointed', 'bright', 'blueness', 'ever-present', 'sky', 'gorgeous', 'iridescent', 'blue', 'black', 'night', 'swimming', 'scene', 'Jack', 'sky', 'suite', 'wherein', 'two', 'actors', 'swim', 'tastefully', 'naked', 'transparent', 'pool', 'Indeed', 'Cruise', 'silver-blue', 'uniform', 'clear', 'glass', 'bubble-like', 'helicopter', 'are', 'sleek', 'artistically', 'interposed', 'world', 'greys', 'blues', 'browns', 'When', 'travel', 'space', 'primarily', 'dark', 'black', 'When', 'trapped', 'hidden', 'caverns', 'enemy', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'world', 'blacks', 'greys', 'browns.There', 'only', 'one', 'place', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'color', 'hideaway', 'Jack', 'created', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'New', 'York', 'Adirondacks', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'California', 'little', 'hamlet', 'lush', 'greenery', 'cabin', 'artifacts', 'Jack', 'lifted', 'trips', 'ruins', 'NYC', 'tucked', 'away', 'books', 'Procul', 'Harum', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'albums', 'doll', 'photos', 'dear', 'audience', 'showing', 'had', 'little', 'chuckle', 'fact', 'one', 'shelf', 'own', 'iconic', 'sunglasses', 'way', 'thinking', 'trademark', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Cruise.So', 'film', 'strikingly', 'visual', 'beauty', 'see', 'theater', 'saw', 'IMAX', 'theater', 'was', 'not', 'shot', 'way', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'soundtrack', 'French', 'band', 'M83', 'also', 'alternately', 'pensive', 'rousing', 'peacefully', 'employing', 'lone', 'piano', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'dishing', 'up', 'insistent', 'orchestral', 'piece.All', 'OBLIVION', 'beautiful', 'striking', 'thoughtful', 'work', ""n't"", 'perennial', 'one-year', 'old', 'genius', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'might', 'say', 'leave', 'richer', 'experience']",N/A

Tom Cruise' uniform and his rifle are cheap and phony to the point of distraction. The uniform Tom Cruise wears is right out of The Day the Earth Stood Still.... the 1950's version, and the rifle is obviously light plastic as he throws it around like a wiffle ball bat.By design, the setting was one of isolation and loneliness, unfortunately this was combined with a thin, uninspired plot which exacerbated the movie's weaknesses. The visuals were striking, but once I adjusted to this I was looking for more substance and plot, which were only partially delivered. Under the circumstances, a deeper, more intriguing plot was necessary.The pace picked up somewhat near the end, with some nice twists, but even these were recognizable themes that leave you with the sense of ""I've seen this stuff before"". This movie needed more Morgan Freeman and little less Tom Cruise.It is not a bad movie. I enjoyed it...somewhat, but it never grabbed me.

This future is bleak since earth is now a resource for a mysterious machine driven power that is sucking earth dry. Like many films and stories, Jack, the character played by Cruise, undergoes an awakening of consciousness regarding the power or authority under which he works. He discovers much about the rag-tag cave survivors on earth and in a play with time finds a capsule with a beautiful women inside.  The viewer makes sense of it all at the same time that the truth begins to unfold for Jack, a time honored technique in story-telling.

Therefore, it's a GREAT Sci-Fi for true Sci-Fi fans, whereas, it may not be well suited for someone whose expecting your normal Tom Cruise type action movie.  Though it has really good action, it's more a Sci-Fi drama than an action movie.  The effects and production value are TOP NOTCH.  The director was very good, as was the acting.The movie kind of leaves you hanging with all sorts of unanswered questions, and, for me at least, this is not a bad thing.  I was left wanting to know more about what happened before the movie's time frame, as well as after.  In fact, I'd bet that if they did a part 2 based on what occurred BEFORE the movie's time-frame, it'd be great to see !The robotic sentries in the movie actually stole a few scenes they were in...they were truly well depicted, and, for the first time an any film I've seen, a robotic presence actually felt scary...scary because incredibly capable, tough, and ruthless.Don't hesitate to see this movie.

Tom Cruise proves that he can still make a good movie, despite all the 'baggage'. I did find myself thinking about that during the movie, which was distracting. This was a good movie, nonetheless.Additional details:Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a drone maintenance technician in some future where mankind has had a war with an alien race. A war which has left the Earth mostly uninhabitable. A few technicians and their controllers remain on Earth to repair and maintain the automated drones that protect harvesters which create energy from seawater. The remaining humans are living either in the TET, a massive space station in orbit, or are orbiting Titan, a moon of Saturn. Once their tour is over, Tom and his controller, Victoria, are to transfer to the TET and then go to Titan. You see early on that Jack is dissatisfied with leaving the Earth, and finds beauty in small things, such as a flower growing in the midst of a massive desert. You also see that Victoria is a `ask no questions and do your job' personality. As the film progresses, this difference between the two characters becomes more and more evident. I don't want to spoil anything about the remainder of the movie's plot, so I'll leave it there.The special effects in this movie are some of the best that I've ever seen, and the flight sequences of the `bubble ship' that cruise uses to go out to repair the drones, are awesome.

1558115,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUO36,Chris Kennison,"[2, 4]","""Oblivion"" is a true science fiction story. I say that because a true science fiction story has technology, gadgets and a futuristic view of the world. Of course in ""Oblivion"" the future of earth is destined for nuclear catastrophe and that theme has been done so many times in movies, it must be true. There are new kinds of drones that are not small planes that drop bombs on targets, but large ""Robocop"" like circular machines with turrets and a programmed mind that annihilates most anything that moves. Finally, we have a spectacularly cool plane that twists and turns and truly must be seen to explain.The biggest thing standing in the way of ""Oblivion"", in my opinion, is an advertisement that claims that it is the best film of the year. Well, it is only April and the summer blockbuster season and the end of the year Oscar season haven't even arrived yet, but that's a pretty bold statement. So, is it?I want to say that ""Oblivion"" is one of the most creative science fiction movies I've seen in years, but I'm going to hold off on that because truly, its creativity is a collage of many science fiction movies that came before it. I'm not going to list those movies because I don't want to give anything away, but there are probably six. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a mechanic assigned to a wife who work as a team patrolling an area that wasn't affected by nuclear fallout and repairing downed drones. Harper and all other known survivors have had their memories cleared; yet he continues to have dreams of his past life.""Oblivion"" has a moody pace to it, occasionally it is eventful and consuming and occasionally it is slow and dramatic. Unlike many movies these days that spend zero time at all building up character and just want to dazzle you with all the really nifty effects they've discovered, ""Oblivion"" does the opposite; it puts character first and then sucks you in with the effects. Maybe a happy medium would have worked better, but I'm not going to complain because I'm tired of movies that make you feel nothing but, ""Wow! That looked cool."" Thankfully, somebody in Hollywood realizes that you need to put heart first when telling a story. If you're tired of emotion-free action/science fiction movies as well, you'll probably love ""Oblivion"".I have a hard time believing by the end of 2013 that ""Oblivion"" will be the best movie of the year. The elements that make up the story are way too recycled to have too much of an impact down the road. Although for now, the realizations of the technology and the heart that it delivers make it the best movie I've seen so far this year. Thankfully, great actors like Morgan Freeman, Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko and an emotional performance by Andrea Risenborough turned a stale story into something memorable and good.",4,"Moody, but has heart where others rely on relentless explosions",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,2790,"['Oblivion', 'true', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'say', 'true', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'technology', 'gadgets', 'futuristic', 'view', 'world', 'course', 'Oblivion', 'future', 'earth', 'destined', 'nuclear', 'catastrophe', 'theme', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'are', 'new', 'kinds', 'drones', 'are', 'not', 'small', 'planes', 'drop', 'bombs', 'targets', 'large', 'Robocop', 'circular', 'machines', 'turrets', 'programmed', 'mind', 'most', 'anything', 'Finally', 'have', 'spectacularly', 'cool', 'plane', 'turns', 'truly', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'explain.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'Oblivion', 'opinion', 'advertisement', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'Well', 'only', 'April', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'season', 'end', 'year', 'Oscar', 'season', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'arrived', 'yet', 'pretty', 'bold', 'statement', 'So', 'want', 'say', 'Oblivion', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'off', 'truly', 'creativity', 'collage', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'came', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'list', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'are', 'probably', 'six', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'mechanic', 'assigned', 'wife', 'who', 'work', 'team', 'patrolling', 'area', 'was', ""n't"", 'affected', 'nuclear', 'fallout', 'repairing', 'downed', 'drones', 'Harper', 'other', 'known', 'survivors', 'have', 'had', 'memories', 'cleared', 'have', 'dreams', 'past', 'life', 'Oblivion', 'moody', 'pace', 'occasionally', 'eventful', 'consuming', 'occasionally', 'slow', 'dramatic', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'spend', 'zero', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'character', 'just', 'want', 'dazzle', 'really', 'nifty', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'Oblivion', 'opposite', 'character', 'first', 'then', 'sucks', 'effects', 'Maybe', 'happy', 'medium', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'complain', ""'m"", 'tired', 'movies', 'make', 'feel', 'nothing', 'Wow', 'looked', 'cool', 'Thankfully', 'somebody', 'Hollywood', 'realizes', 'need', 'put', 'heart', 'first', 'when', 'telling', 'story', ""'re"", 'tired', 'emotion-free', 'action/science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'well', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'Oblivion', '.I', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'end', '2013', 'Oblivion', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'elements', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'recycled', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'impact', 'down', 'road', 'now', 'realizations', 'technology', 'heart', 'make', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'Thankfully', 'great', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Andrea', 'Risenborough', 'turned', 'stale', 'story', 'something', 'memorable', 'good']",N/A

The story, as far as I can tell, is one where the hero is either awake, dreaming, dreaming he's awake or dreaming he's dreaming.  Not exactly Total Recall, but if you think they ran Blade Runner through the office copier for Total Recall, Oblivion borrows from everything from Planet of the Apes to Aeon Flux.  One thing these mega movies teach us is that money does not buy originality.In the end, I think it's the effects and visual design that make Oblivion entertaining.  You know there's trouble when Morgan Freeman has to fill you in on what's up with the story around the 90 minute mark.  Anyhow, my take on the story.  There has been a war.  The earth was victorious but the planet was left uninhabitable except for a little spread that Tom owns, but that comes later.  Since nobody can live on earth, security is handled by a crew of just 2 people; Tom and a gal who looks like Kate Winslet on a crash diet.  They live in a 50's modern glass house on top of a microwave antenna.  The house has a pool that's like a Corningware baking dish, but larger.One day, Tom falls through the ceiling of the reading room in the New York Public Library.  He looks for books by L. Ron Hubbard, but the place is a mess and all he can find is a book about dying with honor and purpose.  Then, his wife shows up, which creates a little friction at home, so Tom starts staying out late in his spaceship even though things on earth are dangerous after dark.In the end, Tom discovers the whole setup is a hoax, run by the folks in the big space station overhead.  You can guess the rest but I won't tell you, except to say he goes up to the big space HQ and it's filled with humans who are in cold storage.  In one of Oblivion's few innovations, these folks are stored sitting down which, I'm sorry to say made it look like each was on the toilet.  End of world but with clean restrooms, I guess.  BTW, I forgot to mention Tom also discovers that he is somebody else, somebody else is him and they fight over it.Whatever Oblivion was about, I liked it for the effects and soundtrack.

1558146,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008JFUO36,C. Sawin,"[8, 15]","In ""Oblivion,"" Tom Cruise plays a repair tech named Jack Harper who travels an abandoned Earth in the year 2077 fixing robot drones. A war broke out years ago with the nomadic Scavs, the only threat still roaming the planet. While the Scavs lost the war, they destroyed the moon and made Earth uninhabitable. Now Jack and his assigned team mate Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two people left while the rest of the population relaxes comfortably on Titan located on Saturn's moon. Despite a mandatory memory wipe for everyone on the planet, Jack still dreams of a woman that isn't Victoria. He begins to question his mission when a spaceship known as The Odyssey crash lands near Jack while he's out on a run and the woman from his dreams literally falls into his lap.The only other film Joseph Kosinski has directed is ""TRON: Legacy,"" so does that mean the soundtrack has to sound exactly the same? To be clear, the soundtrack isn't bad but you kind of write it off because it sounds so similar to Daft Punk's soundtrack of Kosinski's previous film. The one main difference is that there is a ton of synthesizer near the end of ""Oblivion,"" so much that you can actually picture an astronaut on the moon playing a keyboard guitar during the slower moments of the film.That sense of familiarity seriously plagues ""Oblivion"" because it will remind you of at least half a dozen different movies during its just over two hour duration. Tom Cruise seems to intentionally make nods to ""Top Gun"" while flying his futuristic dragonfly-shaped helicopter thing. He even pulls out a pair of aviator sunglasses and places them on a shelf in this delicate ""remember this?"" kind of manner. ""Oblivion"" seems to make the mistake of having an expected sci-fi plot point in its loins without much of anything else to back it up. To get there, it piggybacks on the likes of ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Independence Day,"" and ""Moon."" The issue is it feels like it doesn't try hard enough to leave a big enough impact to actually be remembered by the end of the year let alone six months from now. ""Oblivion"" is like a clone of a clone of a good sci-fi film.Tom Cruise spends a lot of time flying around, sticking his fingers deep into the innards of broken robots, and turning them on. All you'd need is for him to whisper dirty things to them while his fist is still inside them and you'd have some futuristic porno on your hands. ""Oblivion"" is absolutely breathtaking to watch. Earth may be deserted, but it's still beautiful in this empty kind of way. The lush landscapes are incredible. Pretty much anything involving the drones is a lot of fun. In a way, ""Oblivion"" is a lot like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" since the futuristic technology is really creative and just a blast for the audience in general. The drones make so many beeps and boops that you know somewhere R2D2 is getting a stiffy. If you have an inner sci-fi nerd, the intense visuals and electronic sounds of the film may give you the same reaction. There's a drone chase sequence near the end of the film that is pretty outstanding.But somehow everything else going on is really dull. Tom Cruise is torn between two beautiful women? How tragic! Morgan Freeman shows up long enough to do his best Morpheus impression and smoke a cigar in the dark. You can see where the film is going to go, but poor Jack takes an extra 45 minutes to get there because he's got to figure out who this other woman is (which you can figure out the second or third time he dreams about her). Most importantly you won't care where the film is going to go. You can see the big finale coming once Jack returns to that cabin for the second time. The story being told is just so dry and stale. Imagine clipping coupons with a lightsaber or using warp speed on the Star Trek Enterprise to get to the laundromat to fold clothes and stretch either of those tasks out for two hours and you have ""Oblivion.""""Oblivion"" is visual science fiction ecstasy yet is so structurally boring that you'll be edging towards the door two thirds of the way through the film. It attempts to mold this futuristic adventure out of borrowed concepts and mimicked ideas from similar genre films, but it does not compute.

1558160,AE62TIY3899YL,B008JFUO36,"Daniel J. Silva ""Superman_242""","[6, 9]","I remain among the minority that still think that Tom Cruise is a fantastic leading man.  I have pondered about his films he has made over the last few years, and there is actually a decent lineup.  I adored Knight and Day and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a masterful piece of work.  Also, I will watch War of the Worlds any day of the week!  Cruise is so charismatic that I can't do anything BUT enjoy his performances.  Do I disagree with his religious views, among other things?  Yes.  But, if we, the viewing public, were to boycott films that star people that we disagree with, we would end up not seeing any movies.  As a minority among critics (I'm a conservative Mormon), I would have to limit myself to Michael Bay movies.  So, I think that when considering any form of art, we shouldn't discriminate based on the artist's beliefs unless they are forcing them down our throats.Oblivion is directed by Joe Kosinki, the director of a little known film called Tron: Legacy.  I adored said film, and was determined to look past the early negative reviews of his new venture because of my love of Tron.  Ultimately, the only prep that one should have going into this film is that it is a love letter to the sci-fi genre and in particular to that genre's best films.  People are complaining about this and the plethora of plot twists.  Neither bothered me.THE BADThe first act and much of the second drags.  I actually blame this on the trailers: I've seen the film's many trailers many times and it gives away the revelation that happens in the first act.  Also, the trailer was deceptive in giving false impressions of how the mood of the film would be.  It was REALLY different than I was led to believe it would be.THE GOODThe plot twists are fantastic.  I really felt that the actual reveals were subtle enough to evoke real emotion and allow the audience empathize with every one of the characters.  I compare the twists to the ones in The Village in that all the problems that many of the character and verisimilitude issues that I thought were present in the first hour were explained and actually well done.The music is really quite good.  It feels like it could have been by Daft Punk and has a similar feel to Tron: Legacy.  I wish that the trailer that we as regular movie-goers were bombarded with had included this because I think it would have been a good selling point.Morgan Freeman phones in his performance, but even his phoned-in performances are spectacular!  Also, I feel like Cruise gave a great performance.It seems that every review that I read mentioned how beautiful the film looks, and they weren't kidding.  The special effects are breathtaking.  The lighting is really good too.  Also, the sound effects (a trivial thing, I know) were well above average.  I wouldn't be surprised if this film takes the Oscar for sound editing.CONCLUSIONI started out not caring for this film, but as the plot progressed and I reveled in the reveals, I found myself to be really satisfied.  It's still not one I will own, but it's worth seeing.  4/5 Stars.PARENTS GUIDEThis has a pretty intense sex scene for a PG-13.  It has sexual nudity.  Also, it's pretty violent.  NOT FOR CHILDREN.

1558167,A3QU74B9N0830G,B008JFUO36,Dan Thompson,"[0, 3]","In his follow-up effort to 2010's Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski brings us Oblivion, a visually striking and futuristic sci-fi epic that boasts a strong performance from Tom Cruise and an intriguing, albeit recycled, story.In 2017, Earth is transformed and deemed inhospitable due to an invasion by an alien race nicknamed the Scavs. Sixty years after this event, the human race has abandoned the planet for the Saturn moon of Titan. Only two humans remain, Jack (played by Tom Cruise), a security repairman who is tasked with fixing security drones, and Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough), Jack's communications officer and partner. Due to join their fellow compatriots on the enormous space station known as the TET in two weeks, a vessel crash-lands on Earth and causes Jack to question everything he knows about the people he trusts, his mission, and ultimately himself.The biggest achievement of the film belongs to Kasinski, who's vision and direction make this film an absolute wonder to behold. Much like Tron: Legacy, Oblivion contains breathtaking landscapes and dazzling futuristic designs. The look and feel of decimated Earth is truly spectacular and oddly realistic. It's an amazing achievement in visual effects, and it's for this reason alone that seeing the film is worth it.Another impressive factor of the movie is the cast, which is quite small. Jack and Victoria get the bulk of the screen time as the first half of the film is devoted almost entirely to them. Luckily, Cruise and Riseborough have a great chemistry and pull of the ""last two people on Earth"" thing quite nicely. Cruise continues to prove age has not diminished his action-star status and he's particularly good here. The film is more character-driven than the previews would have you believe so having a versatile and well-known actor in the lead spot is a definite plus. A lot of credit also has to be given to Riseborough who is absolutely brilliant in her role as the content worker bee who doesn't want to see the facts laid out in front of her.The one caveat most people seem to have with the movie is that it heavily borrows ideas from many other sci-fi flicks, including Moon, the Matrix, Total Recall, and Eagle Eye to name a few. I find this kind of silly because most sci-fi films borrow from each other in some way or another and while most of Oblivion's ideas may not be entirely original, the execution and visuals more than make up for this. It's an inventive and strikingly beautiful sci-fi epic that holds it's own when it comes to character development and overall story.

But I love a good Sci-Fi movie and this one is pretty good. It evokes emotions like 2001 Space Odyssey. Beautiful. You don't like the acting? What are you comparing it to? Its Tom Cruise. Hey, he does all his own stunts, convincingly. He's no J. Nicholson or A. Hopkins but he's not a bad actor. I'm glad he's come back to reality (again, in real life). You think there is too much CGI? Too Digital? Again, what are you comparing it to? Are you sure you knew you were watching a Sci-Fi movie? Actually if you watch the ""Making of"" on the blu-ray it explains there is a lot more ""reality"" in the movie than you might think and less CGI. But its a modern science fiction movie. CGI is required to tell the story, but I think this movie is a perfect balance. The drones are the coolest, even though they are villains. I love the noises they make... kind of like R2-D2 on steroids. The score is fantastic. You can watch the movie with only the score playing. That's a little weird, but the score can probably stand on its own if you are into just listening to a movie soundtrack by itself. One question I have about one of the characters, Vika, is why are her eyes so dilated all the time? It is spooky looking. Why I am writing a review of this movie that hundreds of people have already given their dumb opinions of, I don't know. Just thought I would offer mine because I liked it so much. Besides the movie, the ""making of"" is a very interesting documentary. Its in 5 parts and in HD as well. Its almost as good as the movie itself.

Overall, the story was pretty good.  Some of it was predictable and I am usually pretty good at predicting what is going to happen next, but I honestly was pleasantly surprised at a few of the twists in the movie.  I saw it coming, but not in the way that I expected.  With this movie, you get some pretty cool future tech vehicles and weapons and some good action.  Overall, the story was a little confusing at first, but was pretty clearly explained in a few short flashbacks, which doesn't leave you going ""huh?"" at the end of the movie.In conclusion, Oblivion is one of those movies that I'm glad I saw.

It's slow, predictable and riddled with holes, but the production's cache of slick, attractive future tech and constant visual revelations make for excellent diversions. Cruise's sleekly designed equipment is a real science fiction goldmine, visionary in the same sense as Minority Report's giant touch-screen UIs, and the first hour is an outstanding lesson in world-building. The plot eventually falls into too many Cruise / mainstream Hollywood pitfalls, though, and borrows too liberally from other films. Duncan Jones's excellent Moon, in particular, is robbed of all but its subtlety, performances and locale. Still, such faults are hardly surprising by this point and if you were anticipating something more... well, maybe an adjustment in expectations is in order.

Smail ""L""","[89, 110]","Oblivion (2013) - Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-WaldauPremise: After an alien invasion, the Earth has been left a nuclear wasteland. Survivors gather aboard the TET in preparation to leave to a new colony on Titan. Before they can make the journey, resources such as water need to be harvested if there's to be any chance for survival: Enter Jack Harper, Tech 49 (Tom Cruise), who with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) protect drones designed to find and kill ""Scavs"" - the remnant alien survivors of the invasions who carry out attacks on the resource gatherers. When a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) crash lands on the planet though, everything Jack thought he knew is called into question...Thoughts: High definition brought out the best in this visually arresting film. The musical score (by M83) is intense, awesome but, at times, a bit overpowering/jarring in certain sequences. The acting is very well done, but unfortunately the film's script and story lacks the calibre of its talent. The story meanders, there are nonsensical plot twists which are not explored for anything but shock value. As a result, at times the film can be quite frustrating. Additionally, not all the characters are developed well - specifically Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's supporting character who - though bad ass - doesn't get developed beyond ""bad ass with long hair and a gun."" But each actor does their best to bring something to the table and it shows - though it isn't enough to cover the plot holes and lack of development at times.Should you buy this film: My experience was watching the film in true IMAX. As such, the visuals were incredible - if you have a High Def television and a surround sound system, then I definitely recommend this film on bluray. Anything less, you're being robbed. At the same time: this film is NOT on the same level as a smaller indie film which covers a lot of the same ground in different ways. If you're looking for quality science fiction, I recommend Duncan Jones' Moon starring Sam Rockwell.

She hated it, even though she really likes Tom Cruise.  Then again, there are very few movies with a sci-fi theme that she thinks is worthwhile.  It's simply not her cup of tea.  And while it's not her most hated sci-fi movie (&#34;Prometheus&#34; probably gets that honor), there was nothing she liked about &#34;Oblivion&#34;.There are many outstanding reviews that I've read here (especially M. Oleson's) that give intricate and informative details on the storyline, so I'll take a slightly different approach.  Obviously, I really liked &#34;Oblivion&#34; (I also liked &#34;Prometheus&#34;), and for several reasons.  First, I enjoyed the story -- one major and a few minor plot holes not withstanding.  Oh, we've seen variations of this story many times, but that doesn't mean I lost interest.  There were times I knew it was purposely oblique, but thought it stood up really well when taken in total.  This is the type of movie where a second viewing may be warranted (I've watched it multiple times).  Secondly, the picture quality is absolutely top tier, stark and pristine &#8230; and so were the sets.  In a word, stunning!  Thirdly, the soundtrack.  It's an incredible, soaring soundtrack throughout that really pulls you in and doesn't let go.  And finally, the depth of the bass.  This movie will shake your walls and slam your body hard (if one has the equipment) with clean, powerful bass.  There is one scene where they use a bass sweep that hits single digits (below 10 Hz) that will put a smile on just about any face.  This Blu-Ray's sound capability will far surpass what any theater can reproduce (even the Arclight in Hollywood).  Theaters simply can't plumb the depths that a well-integrated home theater with powerful subwoofers can, nor do they try.  It's simply not feasible to try and reach anything below 30 Hz due to the sheer volume of a large theater.Rating:Picture quality:  10 out of 10 (I have never seen better)Sound quality:  10 out of 10 (did I mention the incredible bass and the impressively soaring and dramatic score?)Story and presentation:  marginal 7 out of 10 (I had a few issues with parts of the storyline)Overall: marginal 9 out of 10 (which means that I highly recommend it)Summary:  If you like sci-fi and have a nice home theater with some potent subwoofers, I can't think of a better movie to showcase.

1558245,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B008JFUO36,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[15, 28]","Here is Tom Cruise's latest movie in a single sentence: It's ""WALL-E"" with a heavy dose of ""Moon"" and ""Total Recall,"" and a touch of ""The Matrix"" and/or ""Terminator.""If you've seen these movies -- and most other sci-fi from the last thirty years -- ""Oblivion"" will seem oddly familiar. Admittedly, being derivative isn't necessarily a death blow to a movie. But being dull and spiritless is -- and while director Joseph Kosinski crafts a truly beautiful, brilliant post-apocalyptic world to play in, he never crafts a story or characters half as interesting.Sixty years ago, an alien invasion was repelled... but not before they destroyed the moon... which seems to have just made Earth temporarily inhospitable rather than permanently lifeless. The human race has evacuated to Titan, and the only ones left are a ""clean-up crew"" who live in an iHouse high in the clouds, and use drones to exterminate the alien ""scavs.""WALL-E... sorry, I mean Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is regularly sent out to repair drones, but he's more interested in the ruined remnants of human civilization. But one day he finds cryo-pods from a crashed ship, and barely manages to save one of the survivors, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) -- whom he recognizes from half-recalled memories.While trying to help her out, Jack stumbles across a small band of surviving humans, led by Beech (Morgan Freeman) -- and he finds that they are planning to blow up the TET, a human space station. When Jack refuses, Beech sends him off on a quest to discover the truth rather than... well, just telling him what's going on.Joseph Kosinski has only done two movies, but he's already developing a distinct style: bland story and gorgeous visuals. ""Oblivion"" is a truly beautiful movie, with sweeping views of an Earth that has been completely devastated, but is slowly being reclaimed by nature. The only oasis is the cold, sterile iHouse, set in a perpetually rosy cloudbank atop a slender pillar. It leaves you thinking that Kosinski has dreamed up designs for the entire planet, and just wants to tour his postapocalyptic world.Unfortunately, the plot is a Frankenstein's monster of other sci-fi movies. Almost everything in this movie has been done better elsewhere, either directly ripping it off (""Moon"") or in cliche form (oh dearie me, what IS the connection between Julia and Jack?). And there's no passion or energy behind anything that happens -- it all feels bland and generic.And Kosinski is just awful at expositing anything that ISN'T ripped off from those other movies. Major plot twists flew directly over my head because of how blandly they were revealed -- for example, the big reveal involving the TET.Sadly the characters are just as bland and generic as the story. Tom Cruise is basically playing the Generic Tom Cruise Action Hero here -- a good, morally-upright guy who has some murky stuff in his past. Even the character's NAME sounds like a GTCAH name. Cruise gives a decent performance, but he's definitely not stepping outside his action-hero box -- and the character is so blandly nondescript he probably couldn't even if he wanted to.None of these characters have pasts, quirks, other relationships, or anything to really flesh them out -- they're as blandly uninteresting as the plot.. Kurylenko is pretty awful, Freeman is phoning it in, and Melissa Leo and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau aren't given enough to do. The only really good performance is Andrea Riseborough as Harper's lover/partner, who is made pretty miserable by his attraction to Julia. But alas, she also is not given much to do, and is gotten rid of when she becomes inconvenient.""Oblivion"" is a visually entrancing movie, but the Frankenstein plot left me feeling empty and bored. Directed by someone other than Kosinski, it might have been an astounding film... but instead we just get a bland, forgettable one.",2,Earth is still his home,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,3859,"['Here', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'latest', 'movie', 'single', 'sentence', 'WALL-E', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Moon', 'Total', 'Recall', 'touch', 'Matrix', 'and/or', 'Terminator', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'most', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'Oblivion', 'will', 'seem', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'Admittedly', 'being', 'derivative', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'death', 'blow', 'movie', 'being', 'dull', 'spiritless', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'play', 'never', 'crafts', 'story', 'characters', 'half', 'interesting.Sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'alien', 'invasion', 'was', 'repelled', 'not', 'destroyed', 'moon', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'Earth', 'temporarily', 'rather', 'permanently', 'lifeless', 'human', 'race', 'evacuated', 'Titan', 'only', 'ones', 'left', 'are', 'clean-up', 'crew', 'who', 'live', 'iHouse', 'high', 'clouds', 'use', 'drones', 'exterminate', 'alien', 'scavs.', 'WALL-E', 'sorry', 'mean', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'regularly', 'sent', 'out', 'repair', 'drones', 'more', 'interested', 'ruined', 'remnants', 'human', 'civilization', 'one', 'day', 'cryo-pods', 'crashed', 'ship', 'barely', 'manages', 'save', 'one', 'survivors', 'Julia', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'whom', 'half-recalled', 'memories.While', 'trying', 'help', 'out', 'Jack', 'small', 'band', 'surviving', 'humans', 'led', 'Beech', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'planning', 'blow', 'up', 'TET', 'human', 'space', 'station', 'When', 'Jack', 'Beech', 'off', 'quest', 'discover', 'truth', 'rather', 'well', 'just', 'telling', 'what', 'going', 'on.Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'only', 'done', 'two', 'movies', 'already', 'developing', 'distinct', 'style', 'bland', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'Oblivion', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'views', 'Earth', 'been', 'completely', 'devastated', 'slowly', 'being', 'reclaimed', 'nature', 'only', 'oasis', 'cold', 'sterile', 'iHouse', 'set', 'perpetually', 'rosy', 'cloudbank', 'slender', 'pillar', 'thinking', 'Kosinski', 'dreamed', 'up', 'designs', 'entire', 'planet', 'just', 'tour', 'postapocalyptic', 'world.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'Almost', 'everything', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'elsewhere', 'directly', 'ripping', 'off', 'Moon', 'cliche', 'form', 'oh', 'dearie', 'what', 'connection', 'Julia', 'Jack', 'passion', 'energy', 'anything', 'feels', 'bland', 'generic.And', 'Kosinski', 'just', 'awful', 'expositing', 'anything', ""N'T"", 'ripped', 'off', 'other', 'movies', 'Major', 'plot', 'twists', 'flew', 'directly', 'head', 'how', 'blandly', 'were', 'revealed', 'example', 'big', 'reveal', 'involving', 'TET.Sadly', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'bland', 'generic', 'story', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'basically', 'playing', 'Generic', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Action', 'Hero', 'here', 'good', 'morally-upright', 'guy', 'who', 'murky', 'stuff', 'past', 'Even', 'character', 'NAME', 'GTCAH', 'name', 'Cruise', 'decent', 'performance', 'definitely', 'not', 'stepping', 'action-hero', 'box', 'character', 'so', 'blandly', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'wanted', 'to.None', 'characters', 'have', 'pasts', 'quirks', 'other', 'relationships', 'anything', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', ""'re"", 'blandly', 'uninteresting', 'plot..', 'Kurylenko', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Freeman', 'phoning', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Harper', 'lover/partner', 'who', 'made', 'pretty', 'miserable', 'attraction', 'Julia', 'alas', 'also', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'gotten', 'rid', 'when', 'inconvenient', 'Oblivion', 'visually', 'entrancing', 'movie', 'Frankenstein', 'plot', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'bored', 'Directed', 'someone', 'other', 'Kosinski', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'astounding', 'film', 'instead', 'just', 'get', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'one']",N/A

Do I see it on the big screen or wait for the DVD release? I forked over me money at the cinema and I'm glad I did.Here's the scoop. Earth was attacked by some aliens. We won the war but killed the planet in the process. Earth folk have migrated to Titan and Jack, (Tom Cruise) and his controller cum sidekick Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are left behind to maintain the flying drones that guard the massive Hydrogen converters against attack by the scavengers, those who chose not to go to Titan. Jack also has a recurring dream of a particular woman who he somehow thinks he might know. Jack gets caught by the scavengers and he finds out the world might not be set up quite the way he was told.OK. OK. Yes there are some things that were borrowed. And some other things that should throw up red flags for the viewer early on. But this is still a heck of a watch. The director's, Joseph Kosinski, first outing, ""Tron Legacy"", was not really very good. He's taken a huge leap forward here. This is a sweeping film with large scope, great camera movement and faster, more assured, pacing. I did not know where the story was headed and that's a good thing. Too often a movie telegraphs itself. This looked good, had great sets, good effects, good sound, music, editing and all the other production values in line with a project this size. Cruise is aging well. He plays a somewhat cocky character but not quite as severe as ""Top Gun's"" Maverick. Olga Kurylenko is a rising star, and her sweet, appeal works well here. Morgan Freeman is becoming Morgan Freeman so there aren't any real surprises there.I was a bit confused on some aspects of the script but my guess is they'd be cleared up with a second viewing.

Many people find Tom Cruise to be an acquired taste these days after his couch-jumping antics and Scientology beliefs became public knowledge. However, this beautiful sci-fi gem shouldn't be pushed away solely because he's the lead actor.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.Although the story isn't completely unique, ""Oblivion"" manages to borrow different concepts from several classic sci-fi films and blends them together to create something new and entertaining. Director Kosinski does a great job of paying homage to the genre, bringing to mind the visually stunning films of the 1970s and 1980s such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Alien,"" and ""Outland.""""Oblivion"" is rated PG-13 for violence, adult language, and sexual situations. There's really nothing too horribly objectionable to be found.

While I was watching it I was so grateful someone actually invested the money to make this film because it is that rare film you can just turn the sound off (or play only the soundtrack) and give the eyes a feast.Tom Cruise gets a bad rap, and I think unfairly, because of some of his 'antics' and his religion. I don't really care about either. His antics have never hurt anyone and, so far as I know, his religion hasn't either. Yes, I know there are allegations of abuse but that is true of any religion and any atheist group, as well.But he delivers yet again another terrific performance, something he has done more consistently than any actor over the past 30 years. The rest of the cast, but I have to point out maybe the most surprising performance in the film and right up there with Cruise, that of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria.I think the 'scavs' were a disappointment, however, and that is why I take off half a star.Yes, Morgan Freeman is good but they never seemed real to me within the confines of the universe the director had created. Small criticism since they really aren't as prominent as they should have been but no spoilers here. I was able to watch the film without any foreknowledge and I enjoyed it as such. I wouldn't want to ruin that for anyone.The ending? There are great and surprising moments leading up to the penultimate scene in the film. It is an odd scene which is by turns stunning and somewhat pedantic. It didn't rise up to the level of the expectations I had built. But I enjoyed the ride so much getting there that I didn't matter. And I have to admit I did enjoy the very final scene even though I saw it coming.The extras are very good. Tom Cruise is always interesting in his commentaries as he is here with the director.

1558288,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUO36,FNDNreview,"[4, 8]","Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses.  Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on.  In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank - ultimately drowning in a sea of misery.  Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds.  Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth - half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers).  Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan.  However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing - the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams.  And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) .  Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film - and you absolutely should see this film.  Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run.  The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting.  The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper.  Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs.  However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama.  Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character.  Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head - yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed.  On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition.  At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character).  Finally, let's face the fact here - everything is better with Morgan Freeman.By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences - which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones.  These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun.  It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwback sci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly cancelled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it.  Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them.  Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film.  It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important.  But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role - hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.Overall Film Grade:  A-FNDNreview.com",5,Sci-fi Top Gun for Cruise in Oblivion,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,4933,"['course', 'last', 'few', 'years',

1558290,A1PXH1PFDDV7JX,B008JFUO36,"Frank Bitterhof ""Morpheus""","[0, 0]","I confess that the negative critics kept me from experiencing OBLIVION on the big screen and the mentioning of an ""alien invasion"" didn't exactly stimulate my appetite for Joseph Kosinski's hors d'oeuvre (IMHO, there is only one thing that alien beings might find interesting about our planet, and surprisingly the film got that right dead-on). But fortunately one of my friends insisted that I ""wanted"" to see the film and he was right.Many critics claimed that OBLIVION was supposedly derivative and built on sci-fi tropes. I couldn't agree less. Joe Kosinski was never cagey about OBLIVION being an homage to the science fiction films of the 1960's and 1970's (PLANET OF THE APES and THE OMEGA MAN come to mind) and used elements and ideas from these works. But here he created something completely different, original and fresh out of these (and never at the expense of the original work like the shameless ""copy and paste"" of BEN HUR's chariot race in a highly anticipated movie from 1999), resulting in a film much larger than the mere sum of its parts.On the contrary, Kosinski uses these elements and ideas as subtle hints that appearances are deceiving to tell a science fiction story in the best tradition of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, renowned for its unsuspecting story turns and twists. By the end of the film it should be abundantly obvious that the drones were neither inspired by Pacman or WALL-E but rather by a remote-controlled device in one of these films from the last century.Admittedly, watching the film for the first time reveals what appears to be a couple of plot holes but basically these are necessary evils not to give the surprising twist away. Watching the film for the second time and from the inevitable new perspective things start to make a lot of sense and Olga Kurylenko's acting, now that audiences can fully understand what her Julia character must have gone through upon her awakening, is quite impeccable and reveals how skillful Joe Kosinski uses body language (something I had already admired in his previous film TRON: LEGACY) to tell what's going on inside his characters.OBLIVION is presented in stunning vistas and in a cinematographic style that takes the time to tell the story without the hectic pace that often plagues contemporary movies. The Blu-ray looks fantastic, the level of detail and textures is remarkable, colors are natural and the sound design is impressive, giving the drones a unique personality and language (their ""I require assistance"" beacon sound will get quite a different meaning during the course of the story...).The film is enigmatic and thrilling during the first viewing, much clearer and evident the second time, and if you still require insight there's Tom Cruise's and Joe Kosinski's inartificial audio commentary for the entire length of the film. If you buy a film on video disc for repeated viewing, experience and enjoyment, then OBLIVION is most definitely my Number One recommendation during these days.If you're looking for fast-paced sci-fi action comic-strip-style I'd say that the latest STAR TREK reboot movie will be more to your liking. OBLIVION has plenty of good action scenes and visual eye candy (and can do without gore) but here these don't cover up the lack of an original story but rather serve to tell one that's good, thrilling and fresh. It's a passionate accomplishment I found incredibly entertaining and rewarding.",5,The most underrated science fiction film of the early 21st Century,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,3415,"['confess', 'negative', 'critics', 'kept', 'experiencing', 'OBLIVION', 'big', 'screen', 'mentioning', 'alien', 'invasion', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stimulate', 'appetite', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'hors', ""d'oeuvre"", 'IMHO', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'alien', 'beings', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'planet', 'surprisingly', 'film', 'got', 'right', 'dead-on', 'fortunately', 'one', 'friends', 'insisted', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'right.Many', 'critics', 'claimed', 'OBLIVION', 'was', 'supposedly', 'derivative', 'built', 'sci-fi', 'tropes', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'less', 'Joe', 'Kosinski', 'was', 'never', 'cagey', 'OBLIVION', 'being', 'homage', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', '1960', '1970', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'come', 'mind', 'used', 'elements', 'ideas', 'works', 'here', 'created', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'original', 'fresh', 'never', 'expense', 'original', 'work', 'shameless', 'copy', 'paste', 'BEN', 'HUR', 'chariot', 'race', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'movie', '1999', 'resulting', 'film', 'much', 'larger', 'mere', 'sum', 'parts.On', 'contrary', 'Kosinski', 'elements', 'ideas', 'subtle', 'hints', 'appearances', 'are', 'deceiving', 'tell', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'best', 'tradition', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'renowned', 'unsuspecting', 'story', 'turns', 'twists', 'end', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'abundantly', 'obvious', 'drones', 'were', 'neither', 'inspired', 'Pacman', 'WALL-E', 'rather', 'remote-controlled', 'device', 'one', 'films', 'last', 'century.Admittedly', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'reveals', 'what', 'be', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'basically', 'are', 'necessary', 'evils', 'not', 'give', 'surprising', 'twist', 'away', 'Watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'inevitable', 'new', 'perspective', 'things', 'start', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'acting', 'now', 'audiences', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'Julia', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'awakening', 'quite', 'impeccable', 'how', 'skillful', 'Joe', 'Kosinski', 'body', 'language', 'something', 'had', 'already', 'admired', 'previous', 'film', 'TRON', 'LEGACY', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'characters.OBLIVION', 'presented', 'stunning', 'vistas', 'cinematographic', 'style', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'hectic', 'pace', 'often', 'contemporary', 'movies', 'Blu-ray', 'looks', 'fantastic', 'level', 'detail', 'textures', 'remarkable', 'colors', 'are', 'natural', 'sound', 'design', 'impressive', 'giving', 'drones', 'unique', 'personality', 'language', 'require', 'assistance', 'beacon', 'sound', 'will', 'get', 'quite', 'different', 'meaning', 'course', 'story', '.The', 'film', 'enigmatic', 'thrilling', 'first', 'viewing', 'much', 'clearer', 'evident', 'second', 'time', 'still', 'require', 'insight', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Joe', 'Kosinski', 'inartificial', 'audio', 'commentary', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'buy', 'film', 'video', 'disc', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'experience', 'enjoyment', 'then', 'OBLIVION', 'most', 'definitely', 'Number', 'One', 'recommendation', 'days.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fast-paced', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'comic-strip-style', ""'d"", 'say', 'latest', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'reboot', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'liking', 'OBLIVION', 'plenty', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'visual', 'eye', 'candy', 'can', 'do', 'gore', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'lack', 'original', 'story', 'rather', 'serve', 'tell', 'one', 'good', 'thrilling', 'fresh', 'passionate', 'accomplishment', 'found', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'rewarding']",N/A

If you can get by his mundane, expressionless dialogue and haphazard expressions to the camera...perhaps you can just ignore him. This movie is built around two things...the excellent sci-fi premise i.e. storyline and the exceptional concept photography. The concept of a post-apocalyptic Earth is well-described here in a majestic manner and we are taken on an aerial tour to enhance the awe factor. The screenplay is written backwards, as are most mysteries; offering us present realizations and working up to the actual causes. Most alien-visitation flics have dealt with actual aliens. This deals with a robotic alien entity bent on the overall anniliation of the human race. Although acting is not stellar, it is adequate to carry the basic premise. The robotic hardware is incredibly believable and creates an awe factor. Eighty percent action and twenty percent character interaction makes an OK mix for an action film.

1558336,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B008JFUO36,Grieger,"[7, 10]","At this point, I've seen this movie three times (twice in a ""normal"" theater and once in IMAX). That might give you a hint as to where I'm going with this.First a quick disclaimer: I loved Tron Legacy (also directed by Joseph Kosinksi who directs this film), partially because of nostalgia but more because I absolutely loved two aspects of the film which are present here as well: the beautiful visuals of the production's design and the epic soundtrack from Daft Punk. I wasn't too sure I'd love Oblivion but it looked cool (big Sci-Fi fan) and had a nice bit of mystery about what's really going on in the trailers.I will keep this spoiler-free as I think the events of the movie and where it goes are part of the fun.The basic plot summary is Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of a team that's left on Earth to help with ""clean-up"" after the Earth was devastated by an alien invasion. The world is barely recognizable and most of the survivors (save for Jack and Victoria) are either on Titan or on the space station orbiting the planet called the Tet. The pair work on watching over the drones that are guarding huge water collectors that are pulling Earth's oceans to take with the remaining humans to Titan. Jack is the technician who flies in a dragonfly-shaped ship running patrols and rescuing downed drones. The drones are there and are being downed by a remaining contingent of the alien invasion that are scattered about the planet. As the commercials said, we won the war but lost the planet. Victoria acts as Jack's controller, using telemetry to help Jack while relaying orders coming from the Tet's mission controller.The rest you'll have to find out by watching.The film itself, as I said, was beautiful. Everything from the landscapes to the architecture of the tower the duo reside in are just visually stunning. They filmed much of the outdoor scenes in Iceland with its large expanses of desolate arctic tundra and volcanic soil. The director, Joseph Kosinksi, has a background in architecture and it shows in the designs of the tower and vehicles.The story is based on a graphic novel that the director had written and was talking about after Tron Legacy's release. Another reason I love the film is tied to my love for William Gibson's novels. I'm a big fan of concise dialog. There isn't a lot of hand-holding here. And while the story makes sense if you're open to it the first time through, watching it a second time helps as you'll realize why a certain character was a bit distant and laughed awkwardly at a specific moment. Ignore people going on about the reality of the environment and such...it's a movie people. I won't go into those sorts of things here (though I'm happy to discuss in the comments where people can't see...just no rants please). Just know that there are a couple of twists on the way to the conclusion that turn things on its head.The music was composed by M85 with the help of Joseph Trapanese and it's a great electronic ride. I've got the album (off iTunes) and personally I like to remove the ""incidental"" pieces that were obviously specific to a scene (I guess they all are but some are just better off in a movie and not blaring from your speakers). Even so, there are a lot of good pieces (I love Waking Up and a couple others I won't mention since the names could give away something...) and even though I'm not typically a fan of vocals over some of these great pieces, the one track with vocals has been winning me over each time I hear it.As the director himself put it, he wanted to create an environment that was ""desolate but beautiful"" as a sort of 180 from Tron Legacy where everything was dark but colorful. I think he did a great job. I love the fact that he used giant screens projecting video his crew filmed at the top of Haleakala (volcano) in Maui surrounding the tower set so the clouds you see are real, not CGI. That plus the tower set was lit with the light from those projections so you really feel like they're living in a tower above the clouds.On the acting front, honestly, don't expect Oscar-winning performances. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying this isn't Schindler's List. Tom Cruise does a great job playing his character but I think it's more because the character fits him than because he's pulling a Daniel Day Lewis and transforming himself. The other characters play their roles well (hello Morgan Freeman) and Game of Thrones fans will get a small treat from a Lannister.That all said, please ignore the critics' reviews. I read through a bunch and they were all saying the same thing...that the movie wasn't original. That it didn't break new ground in anything and blah blah. It annoys me to no end when I read reviews by these people who do nothing but review movies (nice job!) and somehow expect every movie that comes out needs to be never-before-seen and every performance needs to be some sort of incredible experience that goes into history annals and gets taught at film school. The movie tells a story that's original even if elements are going to be similar to other stories (c'mon, science fiction has been around for generations we've covered most of it). The director does a great job of putting it all together and explaining the parts that need explaining.Unless you absolutely hate any of the actors (especially Tom Cruise since he's central to much of the story) or aren't really a fan of sci-fi (though I'd argue the science fiction aspects really don't matter beyond being tools to tell a fictional story), this should be an enjoyable watch. If you're unsure, feel free to rent it first because as with all things, there are many opinions and what I like may be what you hate.If you liked the style of Tron Legacy, are a fan of Tom Cruise in general, like sci-fi, or all of the above, definitely go for this movie. If not, rent it and decide. I think the marketing of the movie might have hurt it a bit (along with those critic reviews) since this is not that much of an action film. It's more thoughtful. Hopefully you'll enjoy it.",5,"Beautiful, visual film with an equally beautiful score",1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,6094,"['point', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'twice', 'normal',

The moon has been destroyed by Scavengers, who forced humanity to nuke the earth to bits. Some humans are left on earth to guard the conversion of seawater into energy to enable migration to Titan. Scavs attack these installations from time to time.Or so we are told.Now, this crucial operation is left to a scattering of humans with extremely limited defense resources - and throughout the movie you ask yourself, why? Doesn't make sense, even when you find out what's really going on.You already guessed the true nature of the Scavs. The mystery of what really happened is also compelling. But the story - even its big twist - unfolds sloooooowwwwwly. There are scenes which should have been edited out for time. In one egregious example, a proposal scene is described ... THEN THEY SHOW IT TO YOU just in case you missed it. Things just take too long to happen. But the worst is yet to come.The ending is, basically, (SPOILER ALERT) ... Independence Day, only infinitely stupider. Yes,that's right. The aliens who destroyed THE MOON are too clueless to stop one man with a nuke ... An advanced, predatory alien species with the capabilities of interstellar travel and moon-rending allows an already suspect quisling of a defeated race into their inner sanctum with nary a TSA patdown ... Why not just trot the writer onto the screen and pie-face him for not having any believable ideas on how to end it all?. (SPOILER ENDS)It's a shame. Morgan Freeman looks a goof in his round shades. The first plan to nuke the alien ship doesn't make sense (why escort the bomb out? Don't you just program and release it?). And with their resources, surely the aliens could have come up with a better defense plan involving, oh, I don't know, lots of armed, automated machines?Great CGI, great landscapes of catastrophic devastation, some nice futuristic home design. But ultimately idiotic.Update: Stupidity abounds. Searching for a downed probe is better done on a motorbike instead of a cool copter? Why? Recovery and repairs are routinely done with woefully inadequate defenses. Why? And on it goes.Speaking of the end, an earth with no moon is basically unfit for life due to many, many parameters, but let's not even go there.I liked their pug-faced, endearing killer drone design, the copter and their nice house, but that doesn't tip the scales enough.",3,"Mediocre plot, lousy ending",1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,2484,"['based', 'comic', 'case', 'bug', 'not', 'feature', 'silliness', 'plot', 'this.It', 'interesting', 'start', 'moon', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Scavengers', 'who', 'forced', 'humanity', 'nuke', 'earth', 'bits', 'humans', 'are', 'left', 'earth', 'guard', 'conversion', 'seawater', 'energy', 'enable', 'migration', 'Titan', 'Scavs', 'installations', 'time', 'time.Or', 'are', 'told.Now', 'crucial', 'operation', 'left', 'scattering', 'humans', 'extremely', 'limited', 'defense', 'resources', 'movie', 'ask', 'why', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'on.You', 'already', 'guessed', 'true', 'nature', 'Scavs', 'mystery', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'also', 'compelling', 'story', 'even', 'big', 'twist', 'unfolds', 'sloooooowwwwwly', 'are', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'time', 'one', 'egregious', 'example', 'proposal', 'scene', 'described', 'THEY', 'SHOW', 'IT', 'TO', 'YOU', 'just', 'case', 'missed', 'just', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'happen', 'worst', 'yet', 'come.The', 'ending', 'basically', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Independence', 'Day', 'only', 'infinitely', 'stupider', 'Yes', 'right', 'aliens', 'who', 'destroyed', 'THE', 'MOON', 'are', 'too', 'clueless', 'stop', 'one', 'man', 'nuke', 'advanced', 'predatory', 'alien', 'species', 'capabilities', 'interstellar', 'travel', 'moon-rending', 'already', 'suspect', 'quisling', 'defeated', 'race', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'TSA', 'patdown', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'trot', 'writer', 'screen', 'pie-face', 'not', 'having', 'believable', 'ideas', 'how', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'ENDS', 'shame', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'goof', 'round', 'shades', 'first', 'plan', 'nuke', 'alien', 'ship', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'escort', 'bomb', 'out', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'program', 'release', 'resources', 'surely', 'aliens', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'defense', 'plan', 'involving', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lots', 'armed', 'automated', 'machines', 'Great', 'CGI', 'great', 'landscapes', 'catastrophic', 'devastation', 'nice', 'futuristic', 'home', 'design', 'ultimately', 'idiotic.Update', 'Stupidity', 'abounds', 'Searching', 'downed', 'probe', 'better', 'done', 'motorbike', 'instead', 'cool', 'copter', 'Why', 'Recovery', 'repairs', 'are', 'routinely', 'done', 'woefully', 'inadequate', 'defenses', 'Why', 'goes.Speaking', 'end', 'earth', 'moon', 'basically', 'unfit', 'life', 'due', 'many', 'many', 'parameters', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'go', 'there.I', 'liked', 'pug-faced', 'endearing', 'killer', 'drone', 'design', 'copter', 'nice', 'house', ""n't"", 'tip', 'scales', 'enough']",N/A

You wonder if an original blockbuster-type movie will ever be made with genuine effort and a non-ironic purpose, especially in the sci-fi genre. You fear the day will never come. It is nice to be proven wrong.Oblivion is not a fantastic movie by any means. It has its problems. There are some inconsistencies and goofs here and there, but you can tell from the first few minutes that genuine thought and effort was put in to this movie, and that more than makes up for its other issues. There is a style and an atmosphere to it. In a time when green-screen rooms are substituted for real sets so often that you begin to worry for the livelihoods of studio carpenters, here is a film which ""feels"" real. These are sets and locations that, though parts of them were C.G., there was a seamless blending with the real that is a treat for computer weary eyes.Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician responsible for the maintenance and security of huge reactors that supply power to off-world colonists. Earth has been nearly destroyed by an invading alien force and, though humanity won the war, the planet is a wasteland. This is explained by a helpful (if annoying) voice over/scroll at the beginning of the film. Jack's only company is his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) with whom he occasionally gets frisky. Their memories are periodically erased to protect vital off-world information in case of capture by the remnants of the alien force which they call ""Scavs"". In spite of their memory wipes Jack has flashes of his life from before the war, which worries him because the war ended sixty years ago, well before he was born.His companion tells him to focus on his work and not to worry. After all, they are leaving for the new colony in two weeks and they don't want to ruin their chance to rejoin humanity. The work continues as usual until an encounter with the Scavs and the discovery of a crashed spaceship shake everything Jack thinks he knows.From here we would enter into spoiler territory, so I will dispense with the exposition. Suffice it to say that what follows, while not perfect, at least shows true effort at the writing, acting, directing, and effects levels. The actors really care about what they are doing and it shows. Tom Cruise, of course, can only play Tom Cruise. His range is limited, but here it is well used. The mystery of the plot, while a little predictable, at least doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. In a limited fashion the movie brings up questions about what it means to be human and what our purpose really is in the world. Though these issues are not delved into too deeply, it was nice to see them actually dealt with and not just used as cheap set pieces. The set designers and the director take care to create a world we can dive into and almost touch and taste. The sterility of Jack's base really contrasts with the grittiness of the devastated world below.The only items I would change are relatively minor. One is the opening scroll/narration. Opening scrolls may have been cool in Star Wars a few decades ago, but now they are a little dated and annoying. They are especially grating when read aloud to us and doubly so when you divulge the exact same information with dialogue not too long after. The other change would be to distinguish between the female leads physically a little better. Because of the washed out color scheme of the movie it is hard to tell the two women apart at times and it gets distracting. Is that her? No, wait. It's the other one. The fact that the two women are usually in different styles of clothing and in different locations helps, but it takes a while to get there.This is a movie well worth the effort put into it. It is good sci-fi with good execution and no franchise to prop it up. The studio went out on a limb by not playing it safe and finding something to reboot or a big name to tag a sequel onto. Here's hoping this movie gets a lot of attention and maybe we will see more of its kind in the future.",3,Hollywood Is Finally Getting It,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,4095,"['When', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'tend', 'become', 'jaded', 'wonder', 'original', 'blockbuster-type', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'genuine', 'effort', 'non-ironic', 'purpose', 'especially', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'fear', 'day', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'nice', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong.Oblivion', 'not', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'means', 'problems', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'goofs', 'here', 'there', 'can', 'tell', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'genuine', 'thought', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'movie', 'more', 'up', 'other', 'issues', 'style', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'when', 'green-screen', 'rooms', 'are', 'substituted', 'real', 'sets', 'so', 'often', 'begin', 'worry', 'livelihoods', 'studio', 'carpenters', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'real', 'are', 'sets', 'locations', 'parts', 'were', 'C.G.', 'was', 'seamless', 'blending', 'real', 'treat', 'computer', 'weary', 'eyes.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'technician', 'responsible', 'maintenance', 'security', 'huge', 'reactors', 'supply', 'power', 'off-world', 'colonists', 'Earth', 'been', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'invading', 'alien', 'force', 'humanity', 'won', 'war', 'planet', 'wasteland', 'explained', 'helpful', 'annoying', 'voice', 'over/scroll', 'beginning', 'film', 'Jack', 'only', 'company', 'communications', 'officer', 'Victoria', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'whom', 'occasionally', 'frisky', 'memories', 'are', 'periodically', 'erased', 'protect', 'vital', 'off-world', 'information', 'case', 'capture', 'remnants', 'alien', 'force', 'call', 'Scavs', 'spite', 'memory', 'wipes', 'Jack', 'flashes', 'life', 'war', 'war', 'ended', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'well', 'was', 'born.His', 'companion', 'focus', 'work', 'not', 'worry', 'are', 'leaving', 'new', 'colony', 'two', 'weeks', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'chance', 'rejoin', 'humanity', 'work', 'usual', 'encounter', 'Scavs', 'discovery', 'crashed', 'spaceship', 'shake', 'everything', 'Jack', 'knows.From', 'here', 'would', 'enter', 'spoiler', 'territory', 'will', 'dispense', 'exposition', 'Suffice', 'say', 'what', 'not', 'perfect', 'least', 'shows', 'true', 'effort', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'effects', 'levels', 'actors', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'course', 'can', 'only', 'play', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'range', 'limited', 'here', 'well', 'used', 'mystery', 'plot', 'little', 'predictable', 'least', ""n't"", 'insult', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'limited', 'fashion', 'movie', 'up', 'questions', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'purpose', 'really', 'world', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'delved', 'too', 'deeply', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'actually', 'not', 'just', 'used', 'cheap', 'set', 'pieces', 'set', 'designers', 'director', 'take', 'care', 'create', 'world', 'can', 'dive', 'almost', 'touch', 'taste', 'sterility', 'Jack', 'base', 'really', 'grittiness', 'devastated', 'world', 'below.The', 'only', 'items', 'would', 'change', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'One', 'opening', 'scroll/narration', 'Opening', 'scrolls', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'Star', 'Wars', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'now', 'are', 'little', 'dated', 'annoying', 'are', 'especially', 'grating', 'when', 'read', 'aloud', 'doubly', 'so', 'when', 'divulge', 'exact', 'same', 'information', 'dialogue', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'other', 'change', 'would', 'be', 'distinguish', 'female', 'physically', 'little', 'better', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'scheme', 'movie', 'hard', 'tell', 'two', 'women', 'apart', 'times', 'distracting', 'No', 'wait', 'other', 'one', 'fact', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'usually', 'different', 'styles', 'clothing', 'different', 'locations', 'while', 'get', 'there.This', 'movie', 'well', 'effort', 'put', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'good', 'execution', 'franchise', 'prop', 'up', 'studio', 'went', 'out', 'limb', 'not', 'playing', 'safe', 'finding', 'something', 'reboot', 'big', 'name', 'tag', 'sequel', 'onto', 'Here', 'hoping', 'movie', 'lot', 'attention', 'maybe', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'kind', 'future']",N/A

But it is also a patchwork of plagiarized elements.The earth was destroyed, a destruction caused by the destruction of the moon by some not really specified cosmic war. The earth then turned into a wasteland submerged by tons and tons of dust, earth and rocks. The ruins are thus underground. The Golden Gate Bridge is reduced to two pillar tips sticking out of that dirt. That's a rewriting of H.G. Wells the Time Machine.Two humans are living in the ring of satellites that overlook the waste land with a company of drones that are supposed to destroy all signs of life. Jack Harper is the man and the woman is supposed to be his wife. Jack Harper's memory has been erased to enable him to carry out his mission. Total Recall, second episode, the sequel. Everyday Jack Harper is supposed to go down on the surface to revive the drones that have been downed in the night. There is thus some kind of hostile life on this planet, living underground of course. That's Star Wars revisited. An underground resistance has been so often used that listing all the plagiarized connections would take many pages. That implies at this moment that the surviving humans who have fled the decaying planet are controlling the situation from some distant artificial planet. That is a black star like in Star Wars again. But who are these escapees?But memory-deprived Jack Harper knows where there is a secret valley that is as primeval as the Garden of Eden. There Jack Harper has a cabin with electricity and a pile of vinyl records and a record player and all kinds of heirloom  and he plays his records everyday when he manages to escape from the control of his ""wife"" on the surveillance satellite. The drones have never found that place. I guess Jack Harper's lost memory was not lost completely and the drones are not very swift.Then one day a spacecraft crushes on the surface and there are four or five sleep-boxes with hibernating human beings in them. This spacecraft was called by a strange signal from the underground resistance. The drones are destroying the sleep-pods. Jack Harper saves one and takes the woman inside to his satellite base. The reaction of his official wife shows there is a real problem there. When he takes the woman to recuperate the ""black box"" of the space craft they are captured by the resistance and then things become iffy.Let's have one more trip ""Back to the Future"" and then we have two Jack Harpers and maybe or maybe not two women and this saved woman (or her and her double) is revealed to be Jack Harper's real wife, two real wives and two real Jack Harpers. Then the initial Jack Harper recuperates some kind of memory. With the help of the resistance under attack from drones, he realizes that he has to fulfill the mission the other Jack Harper - but that is him in a way, at least if you accept the concept of doppelgangers - and  his wife were entrusted with: to destroy the black star.Officially one of his real wives is hidden in the secret valley, the other one is set in the sleep pod that is going to be delivered by one Jack Harper to the black star with a bomb in it. When he finally reaches his destination, o divine miracle, the wife has been swapped and replaced by the leader of the resistance who is dying of a wound gotten in the last battle against the drones. But the bomb is here, Jack Harper is determined and the final an massive attack of drones against the resistance is under way.What will happen? A happy happening and glorious ending of course. The black star crumbles, the drones are grounded, the resistance is saved, the wife has a child and two or three years later the surviving Jack Harper reaches the secret valley with the resistance and we are in a Grimm-like ending when they are happy ever after, ever after Snow White's step mother dies dancing in red-hot metal shoes.If you like soft horror fairy tales, rush to this one.

The film opens on a 2 minute voice over from Tom explaining things to the audience, followed by a dialog desert for the next 30 minutes, then it twists into a frenzied, quasi love story that taps into Total Recall territory. It's a strangely soulness film, presumably to reflect the loneliness of living in the new world's reality, but as a result it's hard to connect to any of the major characters.Aside from the beautiful apartment in the sky that would send anyone with vertigo into a constant state of anxiety, the production design is fairly derivative of other sci-fi (Total Recall, Wall-E, the Matrix, etc.) Without giving too much away, there are fairly major plot holes and when they finally drop the big surprise, it's pretty clear that somebody thought that ripping off ""Moon"" as an action film would be a good idea.

I'm sure you expect subtle nuances and sophisticated philosophizing, but.... In this dystopian setting (of course) we visit the ruins of well-known American landmarks as our hero is sent to finish the eradication of a few survivors who cling to the remnants of Earth after an interplanetary war. The moon has been destroyed and we see the effects of the resulting earthquakes, while aliens ""farm"" the remaining water. Computer Generated Imaging is used very effectively, although some of this was shot in Iceland, California, New York and Louisiana. The Empire State Building is a critical element.It is impossible to talk about the plot without revealing important points, so rather than do an entire review that is a spoiler, I'll stay pretty general.We see:* Tom Cruise (""Jack Reacher"" and ""Rock of Ages"") is more appealing than usual; this time he plays the stalwart soldier on assignment to ""mop up"" any survivors.* Morgan Freeman (""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""Dolphin Tale"""") is one of those survivors trying to avoid being ""mopped up.""* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Headhunters"" and ""Game of Thrones"") is currently my favorite Danish actor. His character is another one of those survivors attempting to remain alive on Earth.* Andrea Riseborough (""Disconnect"" and ""W.E."") is our hero's partner, sharing that mop-up assignment.* Olga Kurylenko (""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Paris je t'aime"") is the survivor of a crash, rescued by our hero.* Melissa Leo (""The Fighter"" and ""Flight"") is the Commander's voice and face on the communications screen, issuing orders to our mop-up crew.Pay close attention to the plot, as it is satisfactorily complex. I liked one ""sink hole"" that turned out to be the ruins of the New York City Library. Please note that this cast has been assembled in keeping with Tom Cruise's international stardom. His movies are successful throughout the world and they keep his fans in mind when his movies are cast. This is a very good one for him.This is rated PG-13, so expect lots and lots of gunfire, no sweaty bodies, a couple of swear words and nudity only alluded to, but the crux of the story is a ""mind-wipe"" that erases memory, so pay close attention.

The visuals, sound fx, acting and score are all first rate. Even the idea of Cruise as a lone patrolman/repairman is well conceived, as his character slowly evolves from an optimistic boy scout into a reluctant revolutionary. My one gripe with the film is that after spending much of the movie building toward a confrontation with the enemy and the truth, which happens to be one and the same, the director elects to represent the big baddie as a faceless, featureless, expressionless machine. Cold, calculating logic is lethal to be sure but it's also not very interesting and does not give us the memorable villain that this movie desperately deserved.

McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[1, 6]","What do you get when combine the themes from Kubrick, Spielberg, Scott and The Wachowskis sci-fi masterpieces along with some elements of Mass Effect and the mind of director Joseph Kosinski? You get Oblivion an unoriginal, but yet visually stunning and a fun and entertaining sci-fi film.The film was adapted from Kosinski's own graphic novel with the same name. It is 2077 the moon is destroyed and the Earth has been devastated by the event along with the war with the Scavs that took place sixty years ago. Humans won the war, but had to leave after it became an irradiated waste land. The remnants of the human race migrated to Titan a moon orbiting Saturn. Back on Earth a two person mop up crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) repair the drones that protect the machines that harvest Earths resources to take back to Titan. The couple lives a quiet life with just two weeks left to go on their mission. Victoria is content and can't wait to head to Titan. Jack on the other hand yearns for more in life. He has a longing to remain on Earth, and has even found a private Oasis where he has built a home along with that and his dreams of a seeing a beautiful woman on the Empire State Building compels him to explore Earth and collect artifacts and take risks, which get him into trouble and realizations about Earth, the Scavs and himself.Does the story take elements from other films like other critics have voice in their reviews? Yes without question Oblivion does. There are elements from films like Planet of the Apes, 2001 and The Matrix to name a few, but that shouldn't take away from someone's enjoyment of Oblivion. It is virtually impossible to come up with an originally idea with everything have been done before. It is up to the writers and directors to bring their own take on the themes and story along with trying to create a unique vision that will captivate, and bring wonder to the audience. Kosinski wasn't able to create something truly unique, but he was able to bring his vision to life. The story is pretty well done, and yes there are two predictable moments some audience members will be able to predict like who is the bad guy in the film. I was able to discern that pretty quickly, but there are a couple of twists I didn't see coming and certainly don't think most views will be able to predict. The romance and chemistry between Jack, Victoria and Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) is genuine and believable, and plays an important role in the film.Tom Cruise has garnered some criticism in his last handful of films for basically playing the same character and rightfully so. There isn't a whole lot of difference between characters Roy Miller, Ethan Hunt, Jack Reacher or even Stacee Jaxx. Tom Cruise has proven he's a very capable actor he just needs good director to push him out of his comfort zone like Michael Mann did in Collateral or Steven Spielberg did in Minority Report or Oliver Stone did in Born on the Fourth of July, and here in Oblivion he's given one of his best performances in years. Is it on par with some of his best? Absolutely not, but he does give a good performance showing what he is capable of and giving a wider range of performance besides his lad back happy go lucky smiley face performances he's given us in his last couple of roles. The two leading ladies also give good performances in their roles of Jack's loves. Andrea Riseborough is believable as Victoria and you can clearly see her love for Jack. All she wants to do his go to Titan with Jack, so when shows emotions like betrayal and regret it's all the more believable and meaningful. The beautiful Olga Kurylenko also does a good job as the mysterious Julia who Jack rescues. Just like Riseborough she does a nice job of conveying emotion. Morgan Freeman as Malcolm Beech is given a lot of screen time in the trailers, but in Oblivion he is just a supporting character. Beech isn't the best character for the likes of Freeman, but the actor does a decent job with the Beech and the character does play a pivotal role in the film.The action is sparse in Oblivion, but when it happens it is extremely well done whether it is an airborne chase through a storm and canon or a battle in a bunker the action is riveting, and the special effects are really well done. The detailed ruined Earth that was created is beautiful and richly detailed. That combined with the cinematography done by Claudio Miranda makes Oblivion one of the most gorgeous sci-fi films. Miranda is the same person who helped bring the world of Life of Pi to life. Just like in Tron Legacy where Kosinski brought Daft Punk in to give soul to the film he does the same here in Oblivion by bringing in M83 to do much of the films score with Joseph Trapanese. Together the two give sadness and soul when it is needed along with adrenalin boost where it is most needed. The two match the score to the scenes perfectly.I have never read Oblivion the comic, but from what I've read Kosinski had been trying to get this film done for years, until he basically gave up and made his story into a comic. Finally being allowed to bring his vision of a futuristic world to life director Joseph Kosinski does a pretty good job with his follow up to Tron Legacy. This is his baby he birthed and brought to life basically on his own. He had a clear vision of what he wanted to create and it generally worked. Kosinski is a talented director and I can't wait to see what is next for him which is hopefully the sequel to Tron Legacy.I understand the critics, but even with Oblivion being inspired by and taking elements from other sci-fi classics Oblivion along with writer and director Kosinski still managed to bring to life a stunning sci-fi vision with a pretty good story, good acting, great visuals and action, a great score and pretty good directing. I originally had high expectations for Oblivion, and while not living up to them Oblivion is still a good sci-fi film that I recommend to sci-fi fans and people who just want to have a good time.",4,"""And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his Gods""",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,6067,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when',

1558437,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B008JFUO36,JMM,"[15, 18]","Where Oblivion succeeds most is as a pure sensory experience.  I suggest you watch this film on the biggest screen possible with the volume loud - very few movies look or sound as good as this one does.  Three elements make this movie worth watching (and owning on blu-ray):1. The Design - the technology and architecture is amazing.  You can tell that the production design was given a great deal of care (in fact, many of the designs come directly from the director's graphic novel).  I think the Bubbleship is an amazing vehicle and a great design.  Movies like this present exciting possibilities for what future technology might look like - and that's something I enjoy contemplating.2. The Locations - I love when movies take you to places that you might never get to visit in person.  A lot of this movie was shot in real locations (in particular the amazing landscapes of Iceland), rather than on soundstages with bluescreen.  It's also interesting to see recognizable landmarks (the Pentagon, the Washington Monument, Empire State Building, etc) deserted and destroyed.  Of course, the destruction is all thanks to visual effects, but it looks very realistic.3. The Soundtrack - the original music for the film was written by M83, and it's the best movie score of the year.  The soundtrack perfectly compliments the visuals.  In fact, the blu-ray has an isolated score so you can watch the movie with only the music (no dialogue or sound effects) - watching the movie this way illustrates how much of the story can be conveyed through the music alone.A lot of the criticisms of the movie deal with the fact that the movie is derivative - that it borrows ideas from other films.  I would not dispute that claim; I would just say that not every movie is going to be groundbreaking in terms of story or plot.  I think there are enough ideas in this movie to keep it interesting - even if I've seen it all before, I haven't seen it quite like this.",5,Oblivion - one of my favorite modern sci-fi films,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1953,"['Where', 'Oblivion', 'most', 'pure', 'sensory', 'experience', 'suggest', 'watch', 'film', 'biggest', 'screen', 'possible', 'volume', 'loud', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'look', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Three', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'blu-ray', ':1', 'Design', 'technology', 'architecture', 'amazing', 'can', 'tell', 'production', 'design', 'was', 'given', 'great', 'deal', 'care', 'fact', 'many', 'designs', 'come', 'directly', 'director', 'graphic', 'novel', 'think', 'Bubbleship', 'amazing', 'vehicle', 'great', 'design', 'Movies', 'present', 'exciting', 'possibilities', 'what', 'future', 'technology', 'might', 'look', 'something', 'enjoy', 'contemplating.2', 'Locations', 'love', 'when', 'movies', 'take', 'places', 'might', 'never', 'get', 'visit', 'person', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'locations', 'particular', 'amazing', 'landscapes', 'Iceland', 'rather', 'soundstages', 'bluescreen', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'recognizable', 'landmarks', 'Pentagon', 'Washington', 'Monument', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'etc', 'deserted', 'destroyed', 'course', 'destruction', 'thanks', 'visual', 'effects', 'very', 'realistic.3', 'Soundtrack', 'original', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'M83', 'best', 'movie', 'score', 'year', 'soundtrack', 'perfectly', 'visuals', 'fact', 'blu-ray', 'isolated', 'score', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'music', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'effects', 'watching', 'movie', 'way', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'conveyed', 'music', 'alone.A', 'lot', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'deal', 'fact', 'movie', 'derivative', 'ideas', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'dispute', 'claim', 'would', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'terms', 'story', 'plot', 'think', 'are', 'enough', 'ideas', 'movie', 'keep', 'interesting', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quite']",N/A

Supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko (She is beautiful) and Andrea Riseborough; and they all did a outstanding job. I was mainly impressed how fast paced Oblivion was, and how i was still able to enjoy the movie. The visuals/effects were very well done in the movie as well. The storyline is predictable at some points but its nothing MAJOR to worry about. Other than the somewhat predictable parts of the storyline, I can find really nothing else to complain about.

1558522,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B008JFUO36,King of Controversy,"[0, 0]","I remember a reviewer who wrote a very positive review of the Sci Fi film 'Soylent Green' by saying something like 'it's a fine line between campy schlock and a profound film'. Oblivion straddles this line. There's also a fine line between a film that is derivative and one that 'pays homage' to films that have come before it. Oblivion rests there too. There are also one's out there, I suspect, that are not sure what kind of film they want to be. 'Oblivion' resists easy categorization. It has romantic and fantasy elements throughout the film. The viewer never knows where the film is leading to. With Jack Harper's memories being erased, and Earth's past something we grow increasingly unsure of, the events make a good mystery. Oblivion ends up being a feel-good experience of the highest caliber. As loose ends of the film are tied up in improbably ways, the film goes more into a mode of fantasy. As the events become more unbelievable, or at least unlikely, the film becomes more dreamlike. This could seem like a cop-out on the part of the filmmakers, but I enjoyed the film perhaps even more because of it, or because of the way it was done.Oblivion reminds me of an old Outer Limits episode titled, 'Hearts and Minds'. An episode where human soldiers find themselves fighting an alien enemy, or at least an enemy they believe to be alien, when in reality they are fighting other humans - other humans who have been led to believe they are fighting an alien enemy. The film makers may have examined this other work of art before crafting this one. The most startling line to me in the film is when Jack Harper is getting ready to fly into the forbidden 'radiation zone' and when asked what he will find one of the humans says to the other, ""he will find his destiny"". This is obviously taken from the original Planet of the Apes film where one ape asks another what 'Taylor' (Charlton Heston) will find inside the forbidden zone and the ape replies, ""he will find his destiny"" or simply ""His destiny"". It's probably the second most memorable line in the film after ""Get your paws off me you damn dirty ape"". The line makes no sense other than 'go out and find your destiny' until the end of the film or until the second viewing where it becomes obvious that the ape knows in the forbidden zone Taylor will discover he's on planet Earth and his destiny is to be replaced by apes. There was really no need to have a 'forbidden zone' inside the Ape film except perhaps to add mystery to it? It does bring to mind, are the apes so racist they will outlaw travel to half the continent over fears apes will discover they are not the pure 'firsts'? In this film we never really learn what is inside the radiation zones for Jack Harper decides not to go into them other than flying near. One might wonder in hindsight if he would find huddled remnants of a dying humanity but we never discover what is there. For whatever reason, perhaps film length, this is a plot development that goes no where and we are treated with something else to interest us instead.Oblivion owes it's greatest debt to the recent invasion movie 'Skyline'. One where humans face an impersonal, and really unseen, enemy. An enemy who has us fighting ourselves, in a sense. I think the mimicry of so many of these general human themes or archetypes works out in a good way. The familiarity of the subject matter, combined with the uncertainty of where the film is going, move the audience even more. Notice the uncertain relationship between the subservient Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his female superiors, including the female head of NASA, as we are exposed to this film supposedly taking place in the future. It's a mystery for us to ponder. Then we can't help but notice the strong Southern accent of this bureau chief, even as we discover Morgan Freeman is somehow her enemy and we're not yet sure why. We only ever see this one NASA chief, 'Sally', always wondering what is behind her, something that is never really resolved even at the end of the film. Yes, obviously it is not really this NASA chief we are seeing but only a facade set before some kind of alien intelligence that is mimicking her. The most likely guess is that this may be some kind of automated enemy. Certainly a very cold one, at the least. It might be interesting to compare Sally to the computer villain 'HAL 9000' in the film '2001 A Space Odyssey'.I really liked this film and was moved by it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

Now check out Universal's ""Oblivion"" for a better story, characters we can like, and terrific visuals.Yes - Tom Cruise adds another admirable science fiction film to a list that includes ""Minority Report,"" (2002) and ""War of the Worlds,"" (2005). ""Oblivion,"" from Universal Studios, plays to a smarter audience, requiring us to pay attention and think. I like that in a movie, no matter what the genre. I also like the co-stars - Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko.Directed by Joseph Kosinski of ""Tron: Legacy,"" (2010), ""Oblivion"" is based on his story that was originally intended as a graphic novel. A sample chapter was handed out at the 2008 San Diego Comic Com. Cruise got a look and approached him to develop it as a film instead.The story blends character with mystery, outstanding effects, and futuristic toys set in a ""beautiful desolation,"" as Kosinski calls his world. In the five-part making-of feature, he explains he was, ""inspired by shows I liked as a kid like ""The Twilight Zone,"" movies like ""Silent Running,"" ""Omega Man"" ...  [`70s films] with a small cast of characters, but big ideas.""The year is 2077; the moon has been destroyed by invading aliens and, while the humans fought back and won, Earth has been destroyed by tidal waves, tsunamis, volcanoes and nuclear blasts. The surviving population now lives on Saturn's moon, Titan. Cruise and Riseborough's characters, Jack and Vika, have stayed behind to repair security drones and safeguard fusion converters emptying the oceans for transport to Titan via a massive mothership. Scavs - surviving aliens - are the problem, trying to sabotage these efforts. The two have been voluntarily mind-wiped to focus on their jobs, but Jack continues to experience flashbacks to a pre-invasion New York City and a woman he can't put a name to.Kosinki's images were used by ""Oblivion's"" design department. One of the most important is a glass house, the Sky Tower, set on a very delicate foundation structure 2,000 feet above the Earth's surface. It took five months to figure out how the metal-supported design could be constructed, even though it was never built except as a set onstage.The crew used front-screen project, a technique Stanley Kubrick developed for ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" By using this instead of green screen, cloud formations filmed 10,000 feet above sea level in HD, were front-projected on a circular screen surrounding the Sky Tower set. Glass and reflective surfaces, even the actors' eyes, reflect the skyscapes during scenes, creating an even deeper sense of visual authenticity. It looks perfect on the 1080p transfer. Detail throughout the film is absolutely flawless; it's definitely one of the best pictures to be found on Blu-ray this year.Location filming was done in Iceland, where more of Kosinki's imagings, such as a Bubble Ship and streamlined motorcycle that fits inside, were created. A pilot, Cruise helped design a functioning interior for the gyro-spinning cockpit of the ship. The actor, who turned 50 during filming, received an ""Oblivion"" motorcycle to keep.An immersive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix utilizes surround speakers to their best effect. Dialogue, ambient sound, effects and a great score by M83 blend beautifully. One of the extra features is an isolated track in Dolby True HD 5.1 that allows us to watch the movie with its score alone.Additional extras include four deleted scenes, which further explain a few movie moments, and a technical commentary by Kosinski and Cruise. Most of their information is covered in the splendid making-of series. As usual, don't watch the extras until after viewing the movie unless you like spoilers.-- Kay Reynolds",5,"Great characters, visuals and mystery!",1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,3814,"['REMEMBER', 'HOW', 'EXCITED', 'were', 'see', 'Prometheus', 'last', 'year', 'would-be', 'prequel', 'Alien', 'Remember', 'disappointment', 'Now', 'out', 'Universal', 'Oblivion', 'better', 'story', 'characters', 'can', 'like', 'terrific', 'visuals.Yes', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'admirable', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'list', 'Minority', 'Report', '2002', 'War', 'Worlds', '2005', 'Oblivion', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'smarter', 'audience', 'requiring', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'like', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'genre', 'also', 'co-stars', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko.Directed', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '2010', 'Oblivion', 'based', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'graphic', 'novel', 'sample', 'chapter', 'was', 'handed', 'out', '2008', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Com', 'Cruise', 'got', 'look', 'approached', 'develop', 'film', 'instead.The', 'story', 'blends', 'character', 'mystery', 'outstanding', 'effects', 'futuristic', 'toys', 'set', 'beautiful', 'desolation', 'Kosinski', 'world', 'five-part', 'making-of', 'feature', 'was', 'inspired', 'shows', 'liked', 'kid', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'movies', 'Silent', 'Running', 'Omega', 'Man', '[', '70s', 'films', ']', 'small', 'cast', 'characters', 'big', 'ideas', 'year', '2077', 'moon', 'been', 'destroyed', 'invading', 'aliens', 'humans', 'fought', 'back', 'won', 'Earth', 'been', 'destroyed', 'tidal', 'waves', 'tsunamis', 'volcanoes', 'nuclear', 'blasts', 'surviving', 'population', 'now', 'Saturn', 'moon', 'Titan', 'Cruise', 'Riseborough', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Vika', 'have', 'stayed', 'repair', 'security', 'drones', 'safeguard', 'fusion', 'converters', 'emptying', 'oceans', 'transport', 'Titan', 'massive', 'mothership', 'Scavs', 'surviving', 'aliens', 'are', 'problem', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'efforts', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'voluntarily', 'mind-wiped', 'focus', 'jobs', 'Jack', 'experience', 'flashbacks', 'pre-invasion', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'name', 'to.Kosinki', 'images', 'were', 'used', 'Oblivion', 'design', 'department', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'glass', 'house', 'Sky', 'Tower', 'set', 'very', 'delicate', 'foundation', 'structure', '2,000', 'feet', 'Earth', 'surface', 'took', 'five', 'months', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'metal-supported', 'design', 'could', 'be', 'constructed', 'even', 'was', 'never', 'built', 'set', 'onstage.The', 'crew', 'used', 'front-screen', 'project', 'technique', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'developed', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'using', 'instead', 'green', 'screen', 'cloud', 'formations', 'filmed', '10,000', 'feet', 'sea', 'level', 'HD', 'were', 'front-projected', 'circular', 'screen', 'surrounding', 'Sky', 'Tower', 'set', 'Glass', 'reflective', 'surfaces', 'even', 'actors', 'eyes', 'reflect', 'skyscapes', 'scenes', 'creating', 'even', 'deeper', 'sense', 'visual', 'authenticity', 'perfect', '1080p', 'transfer', 'Detail', 'film', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'be', 'found', 'Blu-ray', 'year.Location', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'Iceland', 'where', 'more', 'Kosinki', 'imagings', 'such', 'Bubble', 'Ship', 'streamlined', 'motorcycle', 'inside', 'were', 'created', 'pilot', 'Cruise', 'helped', 'design', 'functioning', 'interior', 'gyro-spinning', 'cockpit', 'ship', 'actor', 'who', 'turned', '50', 'filming', 'received', 'Oblivion', 'motorcycle', 'keep.An', 'immersive', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '7.1', 'mix', 'utilizes', 'surround', 'speakers', 'best', 'effect', 'Dialogue', 'ambient', 'sound', 'effects', 'great', 'score', 'M83', 'blend', 'beautifully', 'One', 'extra', 'features', 'isolated', 'track', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'watch', 'movie', 'score', 'alone.Additional', 'extras', 'include', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'further', 'explain', 'few', 'movie', 'moments', 'technical', 'commentary', 'Kosinski', 'Cruise', 'Most', 'information', 'covered', 'splendid', 'making-of', 'series', 'usual', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'extras', 'viewing', 'movie', 'like', 'spoilers.', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

Drawn to Jack through a connection that transcends logic, her arrival triggers a chain of events that forces him to question everything he thought he knew. With a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to Earth of the past, Jack will be pushed to a heroism he didn't know he contained within. The fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost forever.The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Jack Harper) & Morgan Freeman (as Beech) is great. The directing by Joseph Kosinski (who also produced & wrote the screenplay and the comic book of which the movie is based on) is great. The screenplay by Kosinski, Karl Gajdusek & Michael Arndt (which is based on the comic book by Kosinski & Arvid Nelson) is great.The music by M83, Joseph Trapanese & Anthony Gonzalez is great. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is great. The film editing by Richard Francis-Bruce is great. The casting by Marcia Ross is great. The production design by Darren Gilford is great. The art direction by Joseph Bahran, Todd Cherniawsky, James Clyne & Kevin Ishioka is great. The set decoration by Ronald R. Reiss, set designs by Steve Cooper, Joseph Hiura, Robert Andrew Johnson, Jeff Markwith, Maya Shimoguchi & Randall D. Wilkins, set dressings by Frank Hendrick, Kevin C. Lang, Daniel Newton & Meagan Skerchock is great. The costume design by Marlene Stewart is great. The special effects coordinated by Eggert Ketilsson, supervised by Michael Meinardus is great. The visual effects coordinated by Danielle Bemis, Patrick Halm, Chelsea Kammeyer, Zhunan Li, Sebastian Meszmann, Elizabeth Montes, Hayley Perkins, Sharina Radia, Cara Samuels, Deborah R. Scott, Julia Smola, Adrian Steel, Shanshan Xie & Siyun Yi, supervised by Eric Barba & Bjorn Mayer is great. The stunts coordinated by Robert Alonzo & Joey Box is great.This is a well-done, well-crafted sci-fi / action / adventure film that is entertaining and well-made. This is a film that also has an interesting and intriguingly-done concept that is / or has been solidly interpreted on film. Tom Cruise gives a solidly great performance as Jack Harper. Joseph Kosinski has crafted a film that is completely different and original from his previous film, ""Tron: Legacy"", the sequel to ""Tron"".

The moon was destroyed, although we don't know how, and that was the beginning of the end for Earth.Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Jack Reacher) plays an astronaut Jack who is assigned to repair and maintenance of drones that protect a machine that basically turns our seawater into energy for a the population of earth which has `apparently' moved to a moon of Saturn after an alien attack. It was an alien war in which Earth apparently won or so the audience is lead to believe.Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Dolphin Tale) plays an unsuspecting prospector of many who holds the truth of what really happened. His command of the scenes he is in makes you believe what he says, although unbelievable at first, it could be true. I can't give away the reasons or what he represents without spoiling the film for you, but - spoiler - everything is not what it seems to be.Two really good, sedate but powerful performances come from Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace, Hitman) as a mission specialist with a history with Cruise's character that will defiantely surprise you - and the second performance comes from Andrea Riseborough (Shadow Dancer, Resistance) playing the woman in Cruise's life who along with maintaining the technical aspects of communication is also his partner in life.The ships, probes, drones, vehicles and even the finale with the surprise orbiting station is visually impressive. The action sequences are intense and by the second hour it seems like a nonstop action/adventure film filled near misses and explosions.""Oblivion"" has an interesting and dynamic musical score to accompany the visuals by M.8.3., a pop/rock group with composer Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese that really captures the `feel' of what is going on. The movie really begins to take flight really in the second half of the film but it does have the widescreen epic motif that allows the audience to ask questions and just about almost all of them are answered. Others are not. Overall it's a good film, but not something that will have a long standing in the theatres.

1558582,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008JFUO36,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this film. It is not an immortal master-piece, but it is well made. Below, some more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.Year of Grace 2079. After a devastating war against alien invaders, Moon was broken in pieces and Earth was left a barren, poisoned desolation. The aliens were in principle defeated but what was left of humanity had to move to Titan, which is now being slowly terraformed. The ruined Earth was abandoned to two categories of inhabitants - the Scavs, a handful of alien survivors, stranded castaways barely managing to survive miserably one day at a time and the two lonely humans, Victoria (Andrew Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) who supervise the last stage of evacuation of the planet, which includes pumping and carrying away what remains of uncontaminated water on Earth by robotic installations and automated cargo ships.Jack does the most dangerous job by flying daily repair and maintenance missions, mostly fixing combat drones, which protect the installations from the desperate and aggressive Scavs. From their flying house, a safe refuge out of reach of Scavs, Victoria watches over him, warns him of dangers and if necessary musters drones to help him. It is a harsh and quite sad life, but they have one another for comfort - and also their task will soon be over.But Jack is not well. He doesn't sleep well since some time and every morning wakes up more and more tired, exhausted by strange dreams which repeat themselves - dreams in which he meets a strange Woman (Olga Kurylenko), a woman he can not remember ever knowing, but who nevertheless seems surprisingly familiar... And then, one day after he wakes up for another day of work on the surface, the film really begins...This is a good film, although it borrows heavily from many of older and better Sci-Fi movies (I will not name them, to avoid spoilers - but you will recognise them). Although Philip K. Dick didn't have anything to do with the scenario, he would probably recognise his influence in it - and I think he would have liked this film, for quite a lot of reasons... There is a good mixture of slow scenes setting the mood and of action. There is a mystery in this film, and the FULL disclosure is not given until almost the end - and it is done very, very well indeed. And the ending, always the most vulnerable spot for all Sci-Fi super-productions, is well done - and it is both moving and in the same time asking questions, on which we have to think a little before answering...Tom Cruise, who notwithstanding some excentricities, is a great actor, gives here a GREAT performance, both when talking and when shooting. Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman (who appears late in the film in a way which you will have to discover by yourself) are also very good. But personally, I was MOST impressed by the character of Victoria and the way Andrea Riseborough played her. It is not an easy role and it is definitely not easy to outstage a looker like Olga Kurylenko - but in my personal opinion Ms Riseborough totally did it!Another personal favorite in this film are combat drones - they are really cool, both in their visual aspect (shape and especially this SPEED!) and in the sounds they produce. Those are really some bad@ss military robots, infinitely more dangerous and cooler than most of such things in recent Sci-Fi. And just to be clear - do not expect any cute Transformers-like machines... Those things were made to fly far, find quickly and terminate with extreme prejudice, not to sell action-figures...)))There are of course plot holes - but well, come on, without plot holes all heroes would always die and bad guys would always win. And who would like that?Bottom line, I liked this film and I am very happy that finally I was given the opportunity to watch a GOOD big budget SciFi film. Try to catch it in the cinema as long as it is still playing - me, I think I will buy the DVD when it is available, because it is worth another watching one day.

To me, this was a very thought provoking scifi film.It was also a great love story. And I thought Tom Cruise did a good job acting. What's the mind blowing scifi concept, to me, in this film is that our soul stays with us even if we're cloned, and as the character Jack says in the film, ""If we have souls, they're made of the love we share. Undimmed by time, unbound by death."" So even though there are many clones of Jack, he remembers the love he had for his wife. So, the question is, if we're cloned do we live forever? Do we have more than one soul? Does each of Jack's clones have a soul? As time goes on he remembers more and more. The idea of our existence, our consciousness, being transferred to a clone boggles my mind. Would it really be me? In the end Jack says, ""I am him"". He said, ""For three years I searched for the house you built. I knew it had to be out there, because I know him.""[Julia and Jack stare at each other from across the lake]Jack: [voice over] I am him.[Julia's child points at Jack]Julia's Child: Who's that?Jack: [voice over] I am Jack Harper. And I am home.[Jack smiles]Some have mentioned the unemotional nature of the way the statements were made. I prefer that to ham handed, overly emotional ""acting"". To me, I could imagine myself in that situation, and I think I would have been about the same, not overly emotional. The overwhelming reality of what happened to Jack and Vica, and their legion of clones, is amazing. And the visuals of a future destroyed Earth were some of the best I've ever seen in a future Earth movie.Lastly, it ended so well, so uplifting and happy, to me. ""The Road"" ripped my guts out and the visuals were much more spare, and the same with the ""Book of Eli"", there were some stunning visuals but they left you wanting much more. ""Oblivion"" has wonderful visuals, shocking and stunning, and they were satisfying, I didn't really need to see more. They showed you enough that you ""got it"" without over-doing it.To me this is one of the best scifi films I have ever seen. I loved it. Also wanted to mention Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, his role was pretty small but still a good one, and in the end when he smiles, and he's got one of the greatest smiles, and it was perfectly timed. I hope to see a lot more of him in future films.",5,"Really enjoyed this movie, watched it twice-spoilers",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2382,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'here', 'Seldom', 'do', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'watch', 'twice', 'one', 'week', 'was', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'scifi', 'film.It', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'What', 'mind', 'blowing', 'scifi', 'concept', 'film', 'soul', 'even', ""'re"", 'cloned', 'character', 'Jack', 'film', 'have', 'souls', ""'re"", 'made', 'love', 'share', 'Undimmed', 'time', 'unbound', 'death', 'So', 'even', 'are', 'many', 'clones', 'Jack', 'love', 'had', 'wife', 'So', 'question', ""'re"", 'cloned', 'do', 'live', 'forever', 'Do', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'soul', 'Does', 'Jack', 'clones', 'have', 'soul', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'idea', 'existence', 'consciousness', 'being', 'transferred', 'clone', 'mind', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'end', 'Jack', 'am', 'said', 'three', 'years', 'searched', 'house', 'built', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'know', '[', 'Julia', 'Jack', 'stare', 'other', 'lake', ']', 'Jack', '[', 'voice', ']', 'am', 'Julia', 'child', 'points', 'Jack', ']', 'Julia', 'Child', 'Who', 'Jack', '[', 'voice', ']', 'am', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'am', 'home', '[', 'Jack', 'have', 'mentioned', 'unemotional', 'nature', 'way', 'statements', 'were', 'made', 'prefer', 'ham', 'handed', 'overly', 'emotional', 'acting', 'could', 'imagine', 'situation', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'not', 'overly', 'emotional', 'overwhelming', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'Jack', 'Vica', 'legion', 'clones', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'future', 'destroyed', 'Earth', 'were', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'future', 'Earth', 'movie.Lastly', 'ended', 'so', 'well', 'uplifting', 'happy', 'Road', 'ripped', 'guts', 'out', 'visuals', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'spare', 'same', 'Book', 'Eli', 'were', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'left', 'wanting', 'much', 'more', 'Oblivion', 'wonderful', 'visuals', 'shocking', 'stunning', 'were', 'satisfying', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'showed', 'enough', 'got', 'over-doing', 'it.To', 'one', 'best', 'scifi', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'loved', 'Also', 'wanted', 'mention', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'role', 'was', 'pretty', 'small', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'end', 'when', 'got', 'one', 'greatest', 'smiles', 'was', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'hope', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'future', 'films']",N/A

At the very least, it is clear from the get-go that this is one of those stories where ""nothing is as it seems.""Very much a Tom Cruise vanity piece, Oblivion follows Jack Harper, a man who is stationed on Earth with his co-worker and lover, Victoria. At some point in the past, aliens called ""Scavs"" attacked Earth for its precious resources. They succeeded in demolishing the moon, but humans won the war in a sort of petulant ""if we can't have it, no one can"" move by detonating all of their nukes, turning most of the planet into a radiated wasteland. The humans now live on Titan, getting most of their energy from huge devices that remain on Earth, sucking up what's left of the oceans for cold fusion. Scavs remain on the planet, mostly just being irritating and trying to destroy the water suckers. These Scavs are normally dealt with by a series of robotic drones, but like all things mechanical, the drones occasionally break. It is Jack and Victoria's job to monitor the drones, fix them when they need it, and otherwise just hang out looking impossibly sexy.Of course, things are not what they seem.The story is actually very well-constructed and shot beautifully, and although the tale's secrets are parceled out much more slowly than is necessary (the movie could've been about thirty minutes shorter), it does lend the film a classy sober quality that might've otherwise been made cartoonish with its almost too-slick sci-fi sleekness. Every performer does a great job, although the flick doesn't ask for a whole lot from its cast, and the story lasts longer than its credits. It's a movie that lingers in the mind, which is rare these days.There are a few rough spots, but these come mostly at the end. The movie gets a bit pretentious as it nears its close, seeming to think it's deeper and more meaningful than it actually is. There's also a pretty significant plot hole when it comes to our Good Guy finally defeating our Bad Guy, and the movie engages in a last-minute, unsatisfying cop-out in its (unnecessary) bid for a completely happy ending. These things aside, the movie is truly engaging, and although it sometimes feels like just an excuse to show off how freaking amazing Tom Cruise looks (the phrase ""for his age"" doesn't even apply), it's still pretty good fare.",4,Fun With Flaws,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,2580,"['When', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'odd', 'dreams', 'woman', 'never', 'met', 'who', 'also', 'work', 'routine', 'memory', 'sweep', 'then', 'safe', 'bet', 'viewers', 'heads', 'straight', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'headed', 'very', 'least', 'clear', 'get-go', 'one', 'stories', 'where', 'nothing', 'Very', 'much', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'vanity', 'piece', 'Oblivion', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'man', 'who', 'stationed', 'Earth', 'co-worker', 'lover', 'Victoria', 'point', 'past', 'called', 'Scavs', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'precious', 'resources', 'succeeded', 'demolishing', 'moon', 'humans', 'won', 'war', 'sort', 'petulant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'can', 'move', 'detonating', 'nukes', 'turning', 'most', 'planet', 'radiated', 'wasteland', 'humans', 'now', 'live', 'Titan', 'getting', 'most', 'energy', 'huge', 'devices', 'remain', 'Earth', 'sucking', 'up', 'what', 'left', 'oceans', 'cold', 'fusion', 'Scavs', 'remain', 'planet', 'mostly', 'just', 'being', 'irritating', 'trying', 'destroy', 'water', 'suckers', 'Scavs', 'are', 'normally', 'dealt', 'series', 'robotic', 'drones', 'things', 'mechanical', 'drones', 'occasionally', 'break', 'Jack', 'Victoria', 'job', 'monitor', 'drones', 'fix', 'when', 'need', 'otherwise', 'just', 'hang', 'out', 'looking', 'impossibly', 'sexy.Of', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem.The', 'story', 'actually', 'very', 'well-constructed', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'tale', 'secrets', 'are', 'parceled', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'necessary', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'lend', 'film', 'classy', 'sober', 'quality', 'might', ""'ve"", 'otherwise', 'been', 'made', 'cartoonish', 'almost', 'too-slick', 'sci-fi', 'sleekness', 'performer', 'great', 'job', 'flick', ""n't"", 'ask', 'whole', 'lot', 'cast', 'story', 'longer', 'credits', 'movie', 'mind', 'rare', 'are', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'come', 'mostly', 'end', 'movie', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'close', 'seeming', 'think', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful', 'actually', 'also', 'pretty', 'significant', 'plot', 'hole', 'when', 'Good', 'Guy', 'finally', 'defeating', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'movie', 'last-minute', 'unsatisfying', 'cop-out', 'unnecessary', 'bid', 'completely', 'happy', 'ending', 'things', 'aside', 'movie', 'truly', 'engaging', 'sometimes', 'just', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'how', 'freaking', 'amazing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'phrase', 'age', ""n't"", 'even', 'apply', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'fare']",N/A
1558589,AR5XJEZR0LWWW,B008JFUO36,Mark,"[3, 5]","I usually write product reviews.  But this time I wanted to give you my opinion of Oblivion.  Yes, its a Sci Fi Movie, with action and its also a drama.  Of course its got Tom Cruise playing the lead role of Jack.  Tom did a good job in this movie especially the action scenes, the motocross riding, and the confrontation scenes with the Scavs.  I was a little disappointed in his aha moment with Olga Kurylenko playing the role of Julia on the Empire State Building.  I mean really, the only thing he could say about a previous relationship was ""Thats Impossible""  over and over with little emotion?  Hmmmmm.  How would that make you feel?  How about some jumping up and down on Opra's couch!  Ok, that was a little harsh, but the rest of the movie he is flawless.  And how did Morgan Freeman do?  He was good, he played the role of outsmarting his enemy well with a smile, albeit somewhat hidden, but curiously given away in his new found cheek bones bulging with glee.... nearly permanently!  That's not a bad thing because it wasn't over done and quite refreshing actually. There is something that I would call more than determined when a person has a permanent smile - focused perhaps, knowing that you have finally figured out the enemy and can hardly contain yourself.  I was a little mystified of the pairing between Andrea Riseborough playing Victoria who is work partners with Tom Cruise playing the role of Jack.  Ok, she just seemed a little young I guess.  She looks beautiful of course, nearly twenty something yet work partners (who share the same house and bed) with Jack who looks, well at least 50 years old, but yet they seem to be an ""effective team"".  But what the heck do Aliens know anyways?  Which brings me to the next point.  The plot.  Yes, it was good and out of the box for sure.  I mean why send your brother aliens to battle when you can send... well, something else.  Doesn't that make more sense anyways?  Its what we do in our world right now.  And how about those special effects?

I think that Tom Cruise had gotten a lot better as he's gotten older. And for me that says a lot; I wish I could say the same for Brad Pitt (Note: I hated Brad Pitts version of World War Z, I mean whats the point? If you're not going to stay true to the book, why not just hire a bunch of screenwriters to write a zombie movie and slap a title on it?.....) Sorry....I enjoyed the storyline, and unlike other boys and girls out there, no, I did not wonder why Morgan Freeman wore shades throughout the entire movie. I am perturbed that people have many questions they feel were unanswered, so I'm going to answer some of those questions:&#9726;if the aliens have the technology to build enormous universe-traversing spaceships, build and deploy hundreds of enormous factories from that ship that are capable of draining energy from out oceans over the course of decades, and deploy hundreds of nigh-bulletproof drones armed with laser cannons to protect them, why in the hell did they need an army of Tom Cruises (TC) and Emily Riseboroughs (ER)?Well, boys and girls, in this instance it was one super-brain narcissitic alien running the show with a lot of drones. Do you really think a narcissitic alien would allow its own kind to live and rule along side it? No. ""Sally"", was the only alien. It deployed numerous clones of Tom and Emily because it couldn't leave it's triangular vehicle without putting itself in danger, and enter earth's atmosphere to fight, it's too large and it would be vulnerable.  It required an army of humans to defeat humans. Just like we have antibiotics....(what is happening in our education system that this question was even posed?)&#9726;what happened to the other at-least-50 Tom Cruises and at-least-51 Emily Rossboroughs?The ones in the ship? they died along with ""Sally""The ones on earth? Well, who knows?  But it must've been hell waking up that morning.* Why Does ""Tech 49"" Have Jack Harper's Memories if He's a Clone?That is a good question and I'm glad it was asked because that means a majority of the population see clones as individualistic, having their own personalities and souls. My only answer is because it's fiction.I would recommend Oblivion, I found it entertaining and afterwards, like many, asked many questions that had nothing to do with the movie.

Unfortunately it's not as much fun as Independence Day either, however it's more modern visual effects do provide some stunning scenes.The story is simple, aliens attack Earth and are beaten off with a nuclear attack that irradiates vast regions of Earth, rendering it unihabitable. Most of the survivors ship of to a colony at Titan, but two stay behind to protect essential assets needed to support the far off colony. Remnents of the invading aliens still survive on the Earth's surface and are trying to hamper the operation.Things aren't quite what they seem and the story really unfolds from there. It's fairly predictable as to where the story is heading, but the journey isn't too bad. The cast all do a reasonable job with their roles, but there's nothing inspired about any of it.

It was definitely different than most I've seen, and the ability to keep me on-edge (figuring something was going to jump out at any time) was something few films make me do these days. Some reviewers may give away the plots in their reviews but not I! The twists and turns in this film are mostly unpredictable. The film was shot in many parts of the world, including Iceland, and much of what you see is &#34;in camera&#34; (meaning, not using green screen effects added later). Even some of the sky imagery was created using projectors instead of green screen visuals.The video quality was excellent and the HD audio was incredibly full (almost too much low-end at times). The special features on the blu-ray provide a decent behind-the-scenes look at how it was made. I definitely recommend the blu-ray version (the digital copy is fine for mobile devices but just doesn't have the same quality as the blu-ray).Why not 5 stars?

That cult can make people into robots. Here he overcomes the brainwashing to put in a very good performance. He has to carry the film basically and he deserves a lot of credit for it. this movie is a complicated film , that is extremely well done. In fact , it's one of the better sci fi films that I have seen in a while. Something that the great tv show 'the outer limits' would have done , without any big effects though. And this is spectacular in the special effects realm. It would have been better in 3d though.  I will say that if someone in a review tells you the plot of this movie , then  avoid it. other than if they say &#34; aliens destroyed the earth and tom is stopping the scaves&#34;  then you will not know what is happening!  And that is the best way to watch this top notch sci fi film. The rest of the cast other than the other tech ,  are in very small parts. Morgan freedman and a few others have small parts but they do a good job. This is movie that you can't just half watch , you have to watch it and learn , what's happening as it goes along. It has a surprise in store for you.  I can't imagine any sci fi fan not enjoying this movie. The effects are so stunning and the story is excellent. Even 20 years ago this type of movie would have been impossible to film  properly.  It's taking place in 60 years but the tech does work , WHEN you see the ending. Till then I was like???? how did mankind get this advanced.  SO watch this and find out!  the blu ray is stunning!  More recent movies always look fantastic on blu!  And this one especially so. There are four deleted scenes that should have been put back in to the film. as they were very short and one of them 'the archive' is important to the story.  this is worth watching.

It all combines for an awesome homage to some of the great genre movies - The Road Warrior, Escape from New York, Planet of the Apes, and even Logan's Run.Though the movie has a great take on the concept - some would call it a twist - it does bog down a time or two because characters don't bother having necessary conversations when one expects them to do so.  I chalk this up to storytelling technique and it does allow for a better visual journey toward the answers.A minor quibble is that the alien invasion is shown to have started in 2017 but the human technology shown to exist at that time is at least several decades away.  I'm not sure why that date was chosen when a movie set in the future could have been written for any period of time, but it certainly doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of the film.One can tell the concept started as a graphic novel by taking in the amazing visuals of post apocalyptic America.  The flying chase sequence also has the hallmarks of storyboarded shots fleshed out to full motion effects.

1558621,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B008JFUO36,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 3]","""Oblivion"" is a sweeping sci-fi epic that, because it stars Tom Cruise, elevates its deeply personal material to a level of expectations few films can realistically achieve.  With a title like ""Oblivion"" it's challenging to ignore the baggage Cruise brings to the role.  The film seems to ask: What does it take to obliterate Tom Cruise?The setting is, like ""Star Wars,"" entirely subservient to the characters - nothing happens in the world that isn't connected to the relationships on screen, which means there's little back story provided if it doesn't serve the plot. But whereas ""Star Wars"" could stretch some logical elements with it's sci-fi/fantasy setting, ""Oblivion"" has all the trappings of hard sci-fi, which invites stronger scrutiny.  Unfortunately the setting doesn't hold up under closer examination.The year is 2077, and Cruise plays yet another Jack, Jack Harper, Tech 49.  He and his lover and coworker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two humans left on Tower 49 in what used to be New York City on what used to be Earth, destroyed 60 years before in a war with the alien Scavs.  With Victoria at the Tower and Jack in the field, they work to repair the spherical drones, ED209-inspired robots that move lightning fast and are armed to the teeth.  The drones keep the Hydrorigs safe, giant upside down pyramids that suck up the ocean and eventually send the water to the mother ship called the Tet.  Victoria looks forward to finishing their mission in two weeks and returning to the relocated home of humanity on Titan. Jack isn't so sure, and as his back story is revealed it turns out he's a lot more like Cruise himself.But as the trailers blatantly give away, the Scavs aren't whom they appear to be.  Most incongruous is the fact that Jack and Victoria have their minds wiped ""for security reasons."" Being in the New York sector triggers memories for Jack, and he is haunted by dreams of Julia (Olga Kurylenko) whom he met at the Empire State Building.  When he finds out Julia's real, everything changes.""Oblivion"" drips with symbolism.  It's easy to get wrapped up in the highly stylized visuals of the drones, or the dragonfly like ship Jack flies, or the perpetual dawn that suffuses every frame. But the crux of the story revolves around the Tet - a relationship between three points. The Tet is a physical object - a tetrahedron or four-sided die as gamers know it - and that design is also part of the Hydrorigs.  Point upward the tetrahedron is a pyramid that inspires, builds and ascends.  Facing downwards, it's threatening, ominous, dagger-like.  Visually, we know something is wrong with the Tet just by its appearance.There's more symbolic Tets too.  The delicate balance between Jack - distant, distracted, pining for former Earth - and Julia - clingy, needy, her eyes perpetually dilated in adoration of her man - is turned into a three-point tetrahedron with the arrival of Julia, who has a much more substantial connection to Jack. The Tet becomes a wedge between them, driving them apart with the past even as it connects them together by a shared tragedy in the present.The Tet is also short for ""teth,"" the ninth letter in gematria that spells the name of God in the Tetragrammaton. It is the building block of man's comprehension of the divine, and Jack's relationship with the rest of humanity and the alien invaders pivots on unmasking false gods.This is not a film that will advance women's rights.  Every female character is subservient to Jack, and he is undoubtedly the top of the tetrahedron.  But both women act as his foundation (if only in a deeply-gendered role of lover) and when they are removed he falls with them.""Oblivion"" has enough twists to play with viewers' expectations, but each twist begs more questions with few answers.  This doesn't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of the film's central tenets, but it can distract anyone expecting sci-fi world-building instead of a three-act play.Despite Cruise' involvement, the film is a thought-provoking if occasionally frustrating tale about what it means to obliterate oneself.

My only dilemma - is it really possible to like it as a film? For many reasons, I remain conflicted. Without question the SFX are nonpareil, offering a visually stunning depiction of a circa 2077 discarded, dystopian earth now being harvested for its remaining natural resources. The population long since decamped to one of Saturn's moons Titan, leaving a skeleton crew of Sentinels to monitor the extraction machinery and exterminate the rag-tag remains of the ""Scavs"" who had invaded earth in the 2020's setting off our doomsday spiral. So far so good, especially the performance of Tom Cruise who as ""Jack,"" the sentinel with soul, has remarkably shed his trademarked action-hero disaffection and glowering for something they used to call acting back in the 20th century.Honestly, I'd be engaged as well if Jack's George Jetson meets Paul Blart blue collarness allowed me to survey the planet from the ultimate, coolest penthouse ever conceived for film - a 25,000 foot suspended aerie complete with an infinity pool that is literally just that.Consequently, the first 45 minutes of the film is pure CGI perfection. Desiccated Super Bowl stadia lie in ruins, Petrified, post-nuclear city scapes abound, drying sea beds are littered by rusted husks of oil tankers and cruise ships taunting us with the smug nostalgia of how great we had it back in 2015.......now comes the hard part, telling a story that can stand-alone from the visual pyrotechnics. In the case of Oblivion, the narrative skills of the director, Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters, Karl Gagdusek and Michael Arndt, conspire to near failure, all too frequently relying on story elements that seem arbitrary and implausible.Forget the Scavs and the political machinations on Titan, in an out of nowhere twist, ""Jack"" has discovered a radiation free, paradise valley that he regularly visits to lay back on the grass, fly-fish in a lake fully stocked with trout and boogie to an epic but very ancient stereo system whose turntable is constantly fed by a huge collection of near pristine 1970's classic rock vinyl that must have once belonged to Cruise's pal Cameron Crowe.All around him the steel and rock from a wrecked civilization have been fused into apocalyptic sculpture but please be assured that the 110 year old Pet Sounds album cover is completely intact. An unforgivable stretch in logic even for a film that constantly begs it from you.While I suspect this device is utilized to anchor the story for a contemporary audience, seeing Cruise in his Adirondack chair, sporting a faded Yankees cap while getting off on the Allman Brothers is a WTF bridge-too-far for a story-line that is already crammed and conflicted - in fact this entire arc was so strange, I fully expected Gene Kelly to show up in the next scene asking for directions to Brigadoon.All in all Oblivion is a VISUAL masterpiece that must be seen. However, with the exception of a haunting score by M.8.3 you could just as easily lament that this deeply flawed script was ever made into a Talkie.

1558630,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B008JFUO36,Midge,"[3, 7]","This is the best Sci-Fi I've seen in decades. I don't often hand out praise. This movie was enjoyable to watch a dozen times when I received it and is highly recommended. An excellent cast although there was no chemistry with the actress who played Julia. Olga was not right for the part. She lacked the on screen presence and appeal and simply did not mesh with Cruise on screen. It wasn't any lack of acting. They simply lacked the chemistry needed for the role she played. They needed someone who stands out in a crowd and has sincerity in their eyes. I also think once the background story was known... it should have emphasized the fact that their marriage was kept secret from their crew and aerospace command center at the time which is why she wore the ring around her neck. It also should have included the fact that Vika had interests in him at the beginning and did not know about his marriage. Those two issues were not made clear.I was delighted that there was no blood and gore for a change other than a stain on a shirt. So thank you to the director, writer and producers for not subjecting the audience to violent gore.This was clearly the best set design I have ever seen when it came to the sky house. I found their front projection quite effective and visually stunning for both the audience and cast.The story had some wonderful new ideas... and it might have been nice to have seen some scenes of the thousands who came to attack 50 years earlier.This movie did have a unique story. A wonderful clean, futuristic design of architecture and high-tech devices. The intent to bring Sci-Fi back out into the sunlight is a concept I agree with. Over the years it had become dark and dirty and violent which is a turn off and most of us are sick and tired of those other grungy sci-fi's. While this did have some drone battle scenes (which were a bit long for my taste... but that's what fast forward is for) but some of the most important scenes were cut in favor of useless, prolonged drone battles inside a power plant and unnecessary CGI expense. Battle scenes are boring and monotonous & the audience is quite tired of them.Hasn't anyone noticed that the blockbuster hit movies all had good personal stories, limited battle scenes and no dark, dank or grungy... hit movies like Independence Day. This movie is also one of the best movies in recent years.In general it is the depth of the story, the characters & interaction, the cast and visual technologies which are important. Movies need the audience to invest their emotions. This movie aced the technology and clean futuristic architecture. The relationship with Vika was quite unique. She did a superb job of acting and nearly stole the entire film. The cast was excellent. The designs were beautiful as was the concept. I thought the writers approach to selling the story was a refreshing change from their usual antiquated script formats. I'm amazed it worked. I think more should have been done with Tet and we are more interested in seeing additional scenes of the condition of the cities and survivors survival attempts (like the grain crop concept in The Host) than barraging us with battles. This movie was very sparing about that so it was appreciated. Only 2 significant battle scenes which were fast forwarded through.The 3 most glaring errors were the deleting of the archives scene where Morgan showed him the book of his career. In fact, there should have been more scenes of the archives and more on what they had salvaged. The second was a simple blunder in the script dialogue. Vika told Sally that she needed a drone to scout grid 17 and Sally responds that she is sending a drone to grid 22. Clearly... Sally should have sent the drone to grid 17. Grid 22 wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Someone should have caught that either on editing or at least when prescreening the movie without talking through it... and someone might have heard the mistake. It was pretty glaring. And finally, to hear Morgan talking about waves and bedrock in Chicago was a bit ridiculous. While New York and San Francisco are on bedrock and next to an ocean for tidal waves... Chicago is not on bedrock as far as I know... I've drilled in all three areas... and certainly would not be subject to Tsunami's from the great lakes. Some wave action perhaps... but would not bury Chicago... so that was the third glaring error.It was also obvious that Sally wasn't quite right in the first few minutes with the constant asking about being an ""effective team"". Her Texas accent was also waaay overdone. Plus, I would have waited a few minutes and established the future before doing the dream sequence rather than opening the movie with it. There also should have been more lighting in the lower level workshop. Most workshops are brightly lit. His should have been no different in that respect. But the set for their house was fabulous. I'd like to see all Sci-Fi's use projection screens like that.Unlike some people who judge actors on their personal lives, those issues are of no interest and should not be an issue in regard to the success of a movie. I only care how they do on screen and I must say they were all terrific with the chemistry exception I noted.However... we could have done without the cigar and the goggles on Morgan Freeman. It was not only ridiculous that he would still have access to Cigars after 50 years considering the planet was a wasteland... but it is about time to stop pushing tobacco products on our films. It is a gross affront to the audience especially when it has been banned in practically every building in the country... so what makes these filmmakers think we want to see some nasty cigar... especially Sci-Fi fans who usually have backgrounds in science, technology or engineering. Most of us know better than to smoke and don't enjoy watching it either. Prometheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films. Microsoft or Sony or Toshiba, Apple or Verizon. Not tobacco companies. They should know that watching someone smoke only repulses people these days. It doesn't work like it did in the 40's. It does not make anyone want to smoke unless they are already addicted.We probably could have done without the scene of the 3 drones in that dark, dripping, dingy power plant. I hope the Director and producers realize you exposed your crew and cast to dangerous PCB's and lead and sulfuric acid left behind in that abandoned plant you chose to film in. It can't be cleaned from the concrete floors. It seeps into the concrete floors and then rained down all over the cast and crew during filming. That particular dark, grungy site  also contradicted your intention to bring Sci-Fi back in to the sunlight.I find it disturbing when the directors expose the cast and crew to hazardous and unpleasant conditions. What purpose did it serve to place that poor girl in a tank top in Iceland where she was freezing? It certainly didn't add to her appeal. And why would you allow your high dollar star to become injured? That knee or neck injury could affect him for the rest of his life. It was clear he was having great pain and difficulty walking on it during the library scene. The audience does  not require nor appreciate the actors being injured or subjected to miserable conditions. I think any directors who do this should be banned for life from working on any more films, regardless of how well the movie may have done. Injuring an actor is inexcusable and unnecessary. Their contracts should spell out that they are prohibited from engaging in precarious behavior which may result in injuries. In addition to the damage to the actor, it could bankrupt a studio and infuriate an audience over the gross inconsideration shown to the cast. NO movie is important enough to cause harm or discomfort to a cast... such as filming in 100 degree weather as Star Trek Generations did to 3 star actors who could have died from heat related heart attacks as did Clark Gable and John Candy under similar conditions... or like this movie... putting their actors on top of a mountain Cliff in Iceland. Cruise is over 51 and shouldn't be running up cliffs and high sand dunes if he doesn't want to end up like Ritter, Gable and Candy... despite how energetic he feels. Guys who go overboard to overdo everything to prove their youth are prime candidates for fatal heart attacks.If you want Iceland... then green-screen it. We won't know the difference. Many of us have a long memory about damage to actors and stunt crews... Harry Potter's stunt double who is paralyzed. Vic Morrow and 2 children dead from a helicopter crash on set. Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet age 12 caused a life long back injury. William Shatner with Tinnitus. Ida Lupino, Wayne and crew from cancers after filming in fallout Nevada. I didn't look up any of these incidents. We do remember these incidents and it definitely needs to stop.I'm willing to bet Cruise will require arthroscopic surgery on that knee in 5 years and will end up with stenosis from the neck hyperextension in less than 10 years just from that one library scene in this movie. Frankly, I don't think any movie is worth it.",5,Best SciFi in decades!,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,9245,"['best', 'Sci-Fi', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decades', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'hand', 'out',

Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance.  The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind.  I am a big fan of science fiction!  Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer.  I was not disappointed with this film!  Oblivion is a film that makes you think.  When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on.  When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together.  I like science fiction films that can do that.  This film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone.  It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.The special effects of this movie are fantastic.  This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it.  The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about.  Morgan Freeman's character is also likable.  The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning.  There is not much action in this movie either.  The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it.  The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is.

1558648,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUO36,M. Oleson,"[354, 399]","There may be spoilers.Some critics have panned this new film from director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski, in this his second film (""TRON: Legacy""), as being highly derivative.  But let's face it, how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory?  In any case, don't care.  Whether it's a drama, a comedy, a horror movie or even a romantic comedy, it's how well it is delivered that counts.  And this film delivers.Like ""TRON"" the film is visually arresting.  Seen on a big screen, the sets are huge but sparse, drawing the audience in.  Set in a war-ravaged Earth of 2077 devoid of humans, all of whom have resettled on a moon of Saturn, only Jack (terrific Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain.  They are partners (both romantic and professionally) whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of ""Scavs"" who were the defeated invaders.  While Earth won the war, they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter.Jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone.  Victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology.  While investigating an unusual radio beacon, Jack witnesses a spacecraft crash.  One of the survivors is a human flight officer named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who he has occasionally dreamed about.  Both Jack and Vic have had their memories ""washed"" in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war.  Uh, sure.  What Jack believes to be ""Scavs"" turns out to be Beech (Morgan Freeman) and his collection of survivors.  The truth is out there and Jack must find it, and does with the help of Julia.Like ""TRON,""  ""Oblivion"" is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack, mostly provided by French electronic band, M83.  Yes, ""Oblivion"" borrows from a list of movies too long to mention, but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence, this one does the trick.BLU RAY REVIEW: In this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci-fi film, I was able to tie up a few elements I didn't quite understand the first time around.  I would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre I've seen.  The special features on the Blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully.The other thing I had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between Jack and Victoria and subsequently Julia.  It was there but just wasn't a point of focus.  By ""there,"" I mean it wasn't explicit, either by subdued actions or love making.  Regarding the later, the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool.  It seems clear that Jack's relationship with Victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word.  He does all the right things that husbands and wives do, but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love.  Watch Cruise's face during those intimate close ups.  Something is wrong.  Of course those memory flashbacks of Julia don't help.  When Jack finally does find Julia, it all clicks.  Not quickly, but you can see in Jack's reactions, he loves this woman.  But why?  In the end, he shows how much he loves her.  ""Oblivion"" is also a beautiful love story.There is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen, but this Blu Ray transfer comes damn close.  The 1080p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system.  It comes in the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and does a great job replicating the original film.  The dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks.  When the story moves underground, shadows and shadings of grey prevail.  But even when Jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness, we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor.  I could see no encoding issues.  The contrast and detail are excellent.Equaling the visuals is a magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  Again put this one on your demo list.  If you have sub-woofers, they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire, rockets and explosions.

I paid full price to get it here on AMZ, but it's better than sitting in a theater with noisy dolts.

Some reviews said that this movie was confusing and it had me wondering if the movie critic had any good brain cells left. If you want confusing double up on Inception and 12 Monkeys. Oblivion is fine, but it's not Memento or Butterfly Effect for worthy plot twists.Don't look for a super tight story line, and I'm sure you'll find the same holes in the story that I did.

1558663,AGOEKVIJV9UX6,B008JFUO36,Mr. Markster,"[0, 0]","Minor Spoilers through out:One of the biggest complaints is that ""Oblivion"" borrows a lot from other movies. It's true, but a rather hypocritical reason to trash a movie when in fact just about every sci fi movie has been significantly influenced by its predecessors. The fact that it borrowed from other movies didn't bother me- ""Oblivion"" still has its own voice and unique look.For all the critics who declare ""Oblivion"" is superficial, all style and no substance, I couldn't disagree more. ""Oblivion"" is an intelligent, symbolic and gorgeously filmed story. Like most intelligent sci fi, ""Oblivion"" explores age old philosophical questions of the human condition- do we have souls, do we have free will or are our fates predestined, etc.One of the major themes of Oblivion is that the voices of authority may not be as benevolent and as trustworthy as we' like to believe, and that individual thought and scrutiny are crucial to preserving freedom and humanity. The TET is a physical manifestation / representation of that power that influences us: religion, politics, the mass media - depending on how you look at it.Meanwhile, Jack and Victoria portray different ends of the power struggle: where he is eager, wants answers to the unknown, and is open to exploring new paths and breaking free from the chains that bind him, she is more concerned with doing what she is told, not rocking the boat, and sticking to the path that is set out before her without question or deviation. You could even take it a step futher and ask whether Jack and Victoria are merely acting the way they were MADE to act, or if they CHOOSE to act the way they do (the free will vs. predestination aspect). There is much beyond the surface story to enjoy and ponder on, for those who like that kind of thing. I can't wait to listen to the commentary for additional information.Also this movie is very pleasant on the eyes and ears. One of the most stunning HD movies I've seen to date, with a beautiful musical score by M83 to match. The entire film, from story to soundtrack to visual f/x, all pulls together like an eloquent poem, something that few films successfully manage to achieve. Movies like Oblivion certainly won't be liked by everybody, and not everyone will see the ""eloquent poem"" that I saw: Some of my friends were as disenchanted with it as much as I was mesmerized by it.

No, not Wall*E, but Tom Cruise as Jack (Tech 49) repairing the drones left behind to protect giant energy convertors, all that is left of use on Earth.  In this, Tech-49 is aided by Andrea Riseborough in their austere home in the clouds.  At the start of the movie, Jack is clearly more philosophical troubled by what they do than she is, but this is overshadowed by a greater disturbance in their routine when Jack finds a survivor, played by Olga Kurylenko, which forces Jack to reassess all he knows about his mission.First off, the design is just fantastic.. it's a beautifully detailed world, a believably scorched earth in contrast with their sleek minimalist modern living environment.  It's clear that throw cushions and terracotta are not in fashion in the future.  Also, the director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)) has once again used a contemporary soundtrack which manages to be both epic and modern adding an energy to the movie that it might not have had with a more conventional symphonic score.Tom Cruise never quite escapes being Tom Cruise, making it hard for us to invest in his character, but Andrea Riseborough more than makes up for it with a character so buttoned up that her expressions of emotion need only be the slightest of moments to make a great impact - it's a great performance.  Kurylenko never feels quite at home in her role here, but passes muster.  Morgan Freeman - well, who can say that watching Morgan freeman isn't a pleasure, but he is hardly stretched in what turns out to be quite a minor role.  Great entrance though, which focusses on his distinctive voice before he is revealed in person.  At the end of that short monologue, Freeman says `Lights' and the greater picture is revealed... and that sort of sums up the direction.  After every moment of characterisation, we swiftly move past to reach a reveal of some greater plot or art design, which sort of shows you where the director's heart really is.  He's more interested in the big ideas, than where his characters are coming from or going to.  Many of those ideas in the movie are not original - you get the feeling in the movie frequently of `Oh, that's just like in the movie `insert movie here'.. (it would be churlish to name the movie references and spoil the fun of finding them for yourself).  However, it's been put together in such a stylish way and with such conviction from the director, that it's a success.  Ultimately it's good to see stylish thoughtful sci-fi gracing the big screen, and I for one give it a thumbs up.",4,Superior and visualy breathtaking sci-fi,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2681,"['Earth', 'laid', 'waste', 'debris', 'dust', 'al', 'one', 'lone', 'technician', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'keep', 'things', 'running', 'No', 'not', 'Wall*E', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jack', 'Tech', '49', 'repairing', 'drones', 'left', 'protect', 'giant', 'energy', 'convertors', 'left', 'use', 'Earth', 'Tech-49', 'aided', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'austere', 'home', 'clouds', 'start', 'movie', 'Jack', 'clearly', 'more', 'philosophical', 'troubled', 'what', 'do', 'overshadowed', 'greater', 'disturbance', 'routine', 'when', 'Jack', 'survivor', 'played', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Jack', 'reassess', 'mission.First', 'design', 'just', 'fantastic..', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'world', 'believably', 'scorched', 'earth', 'contrast', 'sleek', 'minimalist', 'modern', 'living', 'environment', 'clear', 'throw', 'cushions', 'terracotta', 'are', 'not', 'fashion', 'future', 'Also', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'Two-Disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'once', 'again', 'used', 'contemporary', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'epic', 'modern', 'adding', 'energy', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'conventional', 'symphonic', 'score.Tom', 'Cruise', 'never', 'quite', 'being', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'making', 'hard', 'invest', 'character', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'more', 'up', 'character', 'so', 'buttoned', 'up', 'expressions', 'emotion', 'need', 'only', 'be', 'slightest', 'moments', 'make', 'great', 'impact', 'great', 'performance', 'Kurylenko', 'never', 'quite', 'home', 'role', 'here', 'muster', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'well', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'watching', 'Morgan', 'freeman', ""n't"", 'pleasure', 'hardly', 'stretched', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'minor', 'role', 'Great', 'entrance', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'revealed', 'person', 'end', 'short', 'monologue', 'Freeman', 'Lights', 'greater', 'picture', 'revealed', 'sort', 'sums', 'direction', 'moment', 'characterisation', 'swiftly', 'move', 'past', 'reach', 'reveal', 'greater', 'plot', 'art', 'design', 'sort', 'shows', 'where', 'director', 'heart', 'really', 'more', 'interested', 'big', 'ideas', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'coming', 'going', 'Many', 'ideas', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'get', 'feeling', 'movie', 'frequently', 'Oh', 'just', 'movie', 'insert', 'movie', ""here'.."", 'would', 'be', 'churlish', 'name', 'movie', 'references', 'spoil', 'fun', 'finding', 'However', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'such', 'stylish', 'way', 'such', 'conviction', 'director', 'success', 'good', 'see', 'stylish', 'thoughtful', 'sci-fi', 'gracing', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised and will buy the blu ray when it comes out.I will not discuss what it is about for fear of spoiling it, but I do encourage to go and see it with an open mind and not to pay attention to those who have reviewed this negatively.I heard that it's predicable, shallow, dull and nothing surprising.

They watched this movie all the way through. I did. And I learned a lot. Though I was sucked. Rudely. Sucked. Dare I say I paid for it, too? Four or five dollars. That I'll never have to spend again on something...else.First of all, why are they still paying Tom Cruise to do anything in the category of suspense? If Tom Cruise is in it, you know it's going to end well for him whether he lives to die another day, or, as in the case of this movie, not. He's either a hero or a Saint. Comforting, if that's what you're into.Then there was that whole stultifying middle part of the movie where there were (not just one but) two Tom Cruises. Wearing the same poorly designed costume. (and for this I had to wait two extra weeks 'til I could afford to watch how badly Tom Cruise would embarrass himself this time? why?)I like Tome Cruise, but Tom Cruise is a bad actor. He sells tickets but, he's a bad actor. As an actor he doesn't know his limits (which is good), but he doesn't know what he's good at, either (which is not good).In Oblivion he's taken on a story that requires stopping first; Cruise plunges ahead. Hold still, even if all he's got is a second, before firing. Know how to stop and hold still; Cruise can't.Still, good for him for considering the possibility.

1558694,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B008JFUO36,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[89, 104]","Earth has suffered a cataclysmic alien attack. In an effort to save the human race and the planet, we fight back. Nuclear weapons are deployed. We fight valiently but it is not enough. The population is decimated. Cities are destroyed. The Earth is in ruin, virtually uninhabitable. The survivors are left with no other choice but to flee the dying planet and make a new home on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.Now imagine that you are one of the only people left on Earth, tasked with protecting and syphoning what few resources remain so that your people can survive. This is Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) job. He and his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are tasked with drone maintanence --- drones that are critical for protecting their harvest operations. These drones are the last line of defense from hostile ""Skav"" attacks. The pair's mission commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), provides support from the space colony above. In a few short weeks, the harvesters will have collected enough of the remaining raw material needed to ensure humanity's long-term survival and Jack and Victoria can then return to be with their people. Only, after a drone repair goes horribly wrong, Jack is left questioning the motives behind his mission and the supposed dangers posed by the Skavs. And he quickly learns, things on the surface are not what they seem.when I saw the trailer for Oblivion coupled with the knowledge that Joseph Kosinski (of Tron: Legacy fame) was attached to direct, I was super excited. So I may not be the biggest Tom Cruise fan or anything but with an all-star cast consisting of Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jamie Lannister from FREAKING Game of Thones!!!), there was no way this movie wasn't going to be a sure-fire winner. To sum up, Oblivion has everything you want/expect out of the genre: killer SFX, action aplenty, pivotal plot-twists and aliens (of course); but it also delivers more than what you initially anticipated. You go into it expecting spaceships and lasers and invasions but you come out having seen so much more.I will utter a word of caution, however, to those of you who expect to watch your a-typical sci-fi thriller: you will probably walk away from Oblivion feeling slightly underwhelmed because the movie takes its time while unraveling its mysteries. It doesn't just jump straight into the action like many others do these days. But if you love a good storyline, I think you'll be thoroughly pleased with what you see. I have to give Kosinski credit for doing the impossible --- he finds that all-important balance between showing riveting action on screen and telling a captivating story, especially in a genre where excessiveness reigns supreme. This isn't just another alien invasion story. There's some good stuff here. And while even the most adamant of sci-fi fans might preemptively anticipate several of said plot twists, it never detracts from the intended impact.But as much as I hail this movie for its amazingness, it's not without its flaws either. There was one big thing that forced me to knock my glowing review down from a 5-star to a 4-star rating. Oblivion isn't just a sci-fi film, oh no. It's a stupid love story! When you expect aliens, instead you get a googly-eyed, sap-filled romance. In fact, a good chunk of the film is dedicated to this unanticipated plotline and it made me absolutely crazy! It's kinda similar to what I felt for the movie Titanic. If you take out the love stuff, the movie would've been so much better! Look, I know what you're thinking. It's not that I'm anti-love, I'm just not a fan of love where it doesn't belong ---- like on sinking ships and in goddamn alien invasions! Get with the program people! When it comes to, I dunno, my survival or getting in my kicks one last time, you bet I'm gonna go with the former.So, yeah. The love stuff. Not a big fan. And that brings me to Olga Kurylenko. Where I felt like Riseborough owned her performance (even the romantic parts), Kurylenko's character only serves to move the love story forward. And while she's not terrible, she's not exactly pivotal either --- more like, just another pretty face. Her character, while it does add some momentum to the spacey stuff, doesn't really inspire. The big surprise for me was Tom Cruise. As I said before, I'm not exactly Tom's biggest fan. For me, he plays much the same character in every movie he's in --- the more-than-meets-the-eye-bad-ass on a mission who ends up questioning authority.That's essentially the case here, only there's more of a softness behind his performance than I've seen in recent years. And where Cruise can sometimes seem a bit alien in real life, he's shockingly human in Oblivion. He proabaly won't win any awards for this performance but you do have to appreciate those subtle nuances that cause you to sympathize with his character's plight. Another suprise for me was how little screen time Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman are given. Their roles albeit miniscule, do serve a larger, more all-encompassing purpose though. They each serve as a meaningful addition and do shine with whatever time they're alloted. I won't say much for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's character other than HUBBA-HUBBA!Another amazingly effective role in the film was actually played by the drones. They are surprisingly animated, each reflecting distinctive and very quirky personalities. They kind of reminded me of WALL-E, in a more deadly shoot-em-up, kind of way. They served to highlight the terrifying nature of Earth's precarious situation and to bring the comedy needed to lighten the mood. And to this I tip my hat to the SFX guru's behind-the-scenes. Much of the drones' character was emphasized by the incredible realness of the barren landscape and the stark modernness of their technology. It also doesn't hurt that I saw the movie in IMAX so much more attention to detail is paid visually as well as audibly. I'd say that I had some fairly high expectations for this film, most of which were met. Oblivion is wrought with surprises mostly good, some bad, but overall, I was pretty blown away by its depth and the post-apocalyptic journey on which we went.Food for Thought: Oblivion is a surprisingly contemplative film with genre-defying cinematography. For a flawed film, strong performances, unexpected plot twists and appropriately timed action make it a must-see. And despite complaints that I might have, both fans and non-fans of the genre can find something to enjoy whether it be the sci-fi journey or the romance that drives it making this movie a sure bet

1558701,A3K4VK1ZQSDF9P,B008JFUO36,NP,"[3, 4]","I can't remember how long it has been since I have seen a classic sci-fi movie. All the recent entries in the genre have been either superhero movies or bombastic-boom-boom-shoot-em-up-alien-invasion ones. And while Oblivion does tread familiar ground sometimes it gets 5 stars by comparison with its peers in the industry at the moment. On its own, it is technically superb with a great sweeping soundtrack, well presented minimalist art direction, stunning landscapes, great acting from a small and excellent cast and tight screenplay that keeps your attention (if you have been longing from a reprieve of movies with giant ball of fires every 2 minutes). This movie also manages to stand on its own without the need for sequels which probably means it gets another 5 stars just for that.From the end credits, it seems that it has been adapted from an unpublished graphic novel and the writer of said novel directs this movie so I guess I saw his vision of his book. And it's only after I came here that I realized that he directed TRON Legacy too (another excellent movie). Hats off to Joseph Kosinski.Whatever you think about Tom Cruise, he sure as heck can deliver a great action/sci-fi movie. This one revolves around him and he carries it effortlessly while displaying a wide variety of emotions ever so subtly. His supporting cast is very good in general but I thought that Andrea Risenborough displayed a wider set of emotions really well and it probably would have been better if she and Olga Kurylenko had switched roles. Morgan Freeman, Coster-Waldau and Leo deliver excellent performances with the little screen time they have and to be honest I really like movies where the director manages to make a story around a small set of characters work well.This is a very good sci-fi movie.

Then, last night, while watching it in IMAX,they started playing a Led Zeppelin song in the movie, I knew it was made for me. Oblivion was a mix of the greatest Sci-Fi already made and yet it was still unique in its own way. Other reviewers have said that the writing is better in the first half and that the movie becomes predictable or not as strong in the second half. I completely disagree. I felt like the script, while borrowing bits from other Sci-Fi, remained engaging and well-done through out the whole movie. If you see this movie in IMAX, in addition to being blown away by the incredible surround sound, you will actually see more of the picture than in a traditional theater. They opened it up for most of the movie. There were a few parts (only one I noticed was around the beginning) where it was the more narrow widescreen picture. For the rest of the time it filled up the huge IMAX screen. The special effects, details, set design, sound design, music, and acting were all top notch in Oblivion (well, Olga was about as good as you can expect from her). The best part about this movie was that my wife liked it. She said it didn't stress her out too much. She also loved the way the music went with the movie. She thought the surround sound and sound effects were some of the best she's heard in a long time. She said she wants to see it again just for the sound. I highly recommend this movie. I liked how by the end, all loose ends are tied up and everything makes sense. This movie does give you the opportunity to think deeper on the meaning, or you can just take what they give you and be totally fine. Go see it in IMAX. I wonder when Tom Cruise will start looking his age...? A note on the CONTENT of the PG-13 rating: Sci-Fi violence on a Star Wars level of graphic-ness. Language that is Low to Middle of the road for PG-13. There is 1 ""F"" word, as is normal for PG-13 now-a-days, and a few ""S"" words and ""SOBs."" Religious exclamations were very minimal, like two I think. There is a pool scene where you see a dark silhouette of rear female nudity then you can see it through the water for a short time also. In another scene, we see a bare female back from the waist up. Thanks for reading, now go watch this in IMAX. Go in with an open mind and be ready to have fun!BLU-RAY UPDATE: I'll keep this brief. The picture and sound are PERFECT. The only downside is that the blu-ray does NOT include the IMAX aspect ratio change, it stays in 2.39:1 the whole time. The special features are actually really satisfying. And it doesn't take that long to get through them. If you want to see how any aspect of this movie was made, you will see in the making-of portion. If you are like my wife, and feel that the behind the scenes stuff ruins movies, then don't watch this part, because it definitely uncovers the magic behind key scenes. The Audio commentary with the Director and Tom Cruise was extremely interesting and entertaining. The musical score isolated audio track was actually really engaging and showed off the beautiful score. The deleted scenes added a bit of depth. Overall, it is a fantastic blu-ray of an awesome movie. This movie holds up to repeat viewings because you'll notice new stuff each time.

1558732,AVTICTX2MD3NR,B008JFUO36,Paula Varjack,"[4, 7]","Epic, slick, and at times a little lost, OBLIVION is a well meaning scifi flick that takes too many wrong turns telling it's tale.Part MATRIX, part TOTAL RECALL, director Joseph Kosinski's tale of a future earth destroyed by alien attack (aided in part by their destruction of the moon).  In the very first minute of the film we're told in a voice over that while humanity won the war (by using nukes), the planet is now a barely recognizable radioactive wasteland.  The few people left are essentially mechanics for huge water processing plants meant to help reestablish humanity on the moon Titan.Tom Cruise's character is plagued by strange dreams of earth before the invasion - an earth he never saw.  These dreams are apparently brought on by the mind wipe he must go through to ensure that if captured by aliens, he can reveal no vital information.  Otherwise he seems content in fixing battle robots meant to destroy the few remaining alien stragglers and having loveless sex with his outpost partner.So much of this film's strategy is based on a slow reveal of a great secret.  Without getting in to details, it's a form of storytelling I've been been overly fond of - the flashback.  While it basically works (there's no doubt that all's not as it should be, right from the start), I can't help but wonder what might have been if this film was told as a linear narrative.And that's because Cruise is never really able to emotionally attach to anything or anyone in the movie, despite a mighty effort to do so.  The story is told in such a disjointed way that one spends more time trying to figure out what the mystery is as opposed to really caring what happens to the people in the story.Now if the script were more witty in it's dialogue or if the music was better, perhaps this style of film making would have worked better.  But the script is as plain a white bread - absolutely bland and perfunctory.  The music is worse - while electronic band M83 (Anthony Gonzalez & Joseph Trapanese) strive for something grand & epic, it comes off a bland version of Daft Punk's TRON: LEGACY score.  That's ironic as Kosinski also directed that otherwise very bland film.  OBLIVION absolutely screams out for a classical score like John Barry might have done, or something as far out and passionate as Vangelis, but instead is as generic as you're likely to hear in a major movie.Put simply, there's very little heart or soul in this film.  The effects are clean, crisp, and largely excellent, and the acting - while not stellar - is certainly good enough.  As are the sets, costumes and the like.  In the end Kosinski seemed far too occupied with the twists of the road as opposed to why he's on it in the first place.  That coupled with bland lines and music really helps limit what could have been a much more thrilling film.  One other huge negative - there's really only about an hour's worth of story here (at least as Kosinski tells it), yet OBLIVION is over two hours long, and that is the kiss of death for me.BOTTOM LINE:  3 ""They blew up the moon in VAMPIRELAND too!"" stars out of 5",3,A slick but mostly souless scifi romp,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,3094,"['Epic', 'slick', 'times', 'little', 'lost', 'OBLIVION', 'well', 'meaning', 'scifi', 'flick', 'too', 'many', 'wrong', 'turns', 'telling', 'tale.Part', 'MATRIX', 'part', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'tale', 'future', 'earth', 'destroyed', 'alien', 'attack', 'aided', 'part', 'destruction', 'moon', 'very', 'first', 'minute', 'film', ""'re"", 'told', 'voice', 'humanity', 'won', 'war', 'using', 'nukes', 'planet', 'now', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'radioactive', 'wasteland', 'few', 'people', 'left', 'are', 'essentially', 'mechanics', 'huge', 'water', 'processing', 'plants', 'meant', 'help', 'reestablish', 'humanity', 'moon', 'Titan.Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'plagued', 'strange', 'dreams', 'earth', 'invasion', 'earth', 'never', 'saw', 'dreams', 'are', 'apparently', 'brought', 'mind', 'wipe', 'must', 'go', 'ensure', 'captured', 'aliens', 'can', 'reveal', 'vital', 'information', 'Otherwise', 'content', 'fixing', 'battle', 'robots', 'meant', 'destroy', 'few', 'remaining', 'alien', 'stragglers', 'having', 'loveless', 'sex', 'outpost', 'partner.So', 'much', 'film', 'strategy', 'based', 'slow', 'reveal', 'great', 'secret', 'getting', 'details', 'form', 'storytelling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'been', 'overly', 'fond', 'flashback', 'basically', 'doubt', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'was', 'told', 'linear', 'narrative.And', 'Cruise', 'never', 'really', 'able', 'emotionally', 'attach', 'anything', 'anyone', 'movie', 'mighty', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'story', 'told', 'such', 'disjointed', 'way', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'mystery', 'as', 'opposed', 'really', 'caring', 'what', 'people', 'story.Now', 'script', 'were', 'more', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'music', 'was', 'better', 'perhaps', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'script', 'as', 'plain', 'white', 'bread', 'absolutely', 'bland', 'perfunctory', 'music', 'worse', 'electronic', 'band', 'M83', 'Anthony', 'Gonzalez', 'Joseph', 'Trapanese', 'strive', 'something', 'grand', 'epic', 'off', 'bland', 'version', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'TRON', 'LEGACY', 'score', 'ironic', 'Kosinski', 'also', 'directed', 'otherwise', 'very', 'bland', 'film', 'OBLIVION', 'absolutely', 'out', 'classical', 'score', 'John', 'Barry', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'far', 'passionate', 'Vangelis', 'instead', 'as', 'generic', ""'re"", 'likely', 'hear', 'major', 'movie.Put', 'simply', 'very', 'little', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'clean', 'crisp', 'largely', 'excellent', 'acting', 'not', 'stellar', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'are', 'sets', 'costumes', 'like', 'end', 'Kosinski', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'occupied', 'twists', 'road', 'opposed', 'why', 'first', 'place', 'coupled', 'bland', 'lines', 'music', 'really', 'limit', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'thrilling', 'film', 'One', 'other', 'huge', 'negative', 'really', 'only', 'hour', 'worth', 'story', 'here', 'least', 'Kosinski', 'OBLIVION', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'kiss', 'death', 'me.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '3', 'blew', 'up', 'moon', 'VAMPIRELAND', 'too', '5']",N/A

I read that the plot did not make sense. I think the plot makes perfect sense, and is interesting as well as ingenious as well as sweet. I will make one small criticism: the perfect home and machines that the 2 humans live and work in seem too perfect to be true ( but I think that the alien tech entity could easily maintain them ) Another small complaint: we are supposed to believe that this fantastic technological entity still needs humans to repair some of the machines ( I believe that this is probable, just look at our own world, machines are always breaking down ). And one other small criticism: We only see one small group of survivors ( actually, I prefer this. Some movies, like the matrix, try to show too much and thereby become less interesting ). So you see that all my criticisms actually are not criticisms at all. This story is solid, well told, moves along swiftly, and is continually interesting. Even the schmaltzy parts are perfect. There is one small but important scene which cries out for the perfect soundtrack song. I found myself thinking that this would be the perfect place to play A Whiter Shade Of Pale... and it plays!!!!

Set in 2077, 60 years after Earth is invaded by alien beings called Scavengers (Scavs), who destroy the Moon, resulting in a tectonic upheaval, that - combined with nuclear weapons, used to defeat the aliens, have resulted in Earth becoming virtually uninhabitable. The remaining humans inhabit a huge space station and have established a colony on Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Cruise as Jack Harper, is Tech 49, who is responsible for patrolling the radiation-free sections of Earth and for maintenance of drone warships that hunt down the remaining Scavs. He is assisted by his communications officer and lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). At the end of one of his patrols, the Odyssey, a NASA spaceship crashes and in the only survivor is a mysterious female, Julia (Olga Kurylenko). But things are not exactly as they seem. Be prepared for some surprises, beginning with the appearance Julia and Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) who leads an underground stronghold of...humans. Produced, directed and written by Joseph Kosinski, he gets triple credit for its excellence.

I am glad I did.Everyone agrees that this movie is visually stunning.  It is, but let's get past that.  Right off the bat, you are made to think about what is happening.  You have the strange feeling that something isn't quite what it appears, but you don't know what.  Funny, but that is exactly the feeling of Tom Cruise's character.  Throughout the movie, it takes twists and turns that you didn't expect.The video and audio are excellent.  The casting was great.  Look, if you need a guy with an intense stare that doesn't quite know what is going on, Tom Cruise is perfect.  If you need someone to project that he really does know what is going on, Morgan Freeman is the natural choice.  The rest of the cast Was excellent, each portraying their characters to a tee.  Special credit to Melissa Leo for adding some incipient creepiness which was fun to watch.Now, why did I ignore all those one-star reviews?  First, those who said the movie was bad because they didn't understand it, put the blame in the wrong place.  Second, those who cried, ""bad science"", need to understand that the movie is entertainment, not education.  Sure, hydrogen is the most available element in the universe, but that does not prevent some visually interesting ways of obtaining it.  Yes, the story borrowed from other works.

1558810,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B008JFUO36,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","OBLIVION is a gorgeous movie to look at.  It's a marvel of brown and gray.  Tom Cruise is a charismatic movie star.  Those two elements alone make the film worth seeing.  And it's a good thing OBLIVION has those things going for it, because much of the rest is so-so at best.I appreciated the steady , slow-paced build of this film...it is not very action heavy, short of one extended (and disjointed) shootout in an underground bunker facility.  We really mostly spend A LOT of time in closeup with Tom Cruise, with a gorgeously ravaged earth all around him.We meet Cruise as he's setting out on another ""drone repair"" mission to earth...and earth that was essentially obliterated during a war with alien invaders.  We won the war, but had to abandon the ruined planet.  Cruise and his partner/lover (Andrea Riseborough) are all alone on a station build well above the surface of the planet.  Below, the cities and farmlands are all covered in dunes.  The top of the Empire State Building is all that pokes through the surface...most of the rest of NYC is buried.  Offshore, gigantic machines, serviced by drones, are pulling up the water from our oceans and are used up in a fusion process to bring energy to Saturn's moon, Titan...where the remnants of humanity have fled.Riseborough (an actress I don't know well, but who makes for an interesting, striking figure) stays on the station, while Cruise yearns to spend more and more time on earth.  He has no memories of the planet, but he has an infinite interest in what life was like there.  His passion for his work and for the planet are what draw us to his character.  Cruise is seldom a truly great actor.  But he's one of those stars (like Clooney) who are charismatic and engaging.  Cruise is usually helped by having a character with a dark side or a past...and we get hints of both.  He carries himself with both great physical assurance AND air of sadness.And the earth around him, bleak and nearly empty, is a CGI wonder.  I know that almost all of it is completely ""fake"" but the special effects teams have done a stellar job in creating a convincing, post-apocalyptic world that is lovely to look at.  I enjoyed the many scenes where Cruise flies around.  I'm so tired of bloated CGI worlds, be they Middle Earth or Thor's home planet or any other gilded, over-stuffed fantasy world.  OBLIVION feels ""tasteful.""  The color palette, from Riseborough's clothing to the hue of the sand dunes, is soothing and creative.Needless to say, the movie is not just about Cruise flying around earth.  Slowly and surely, the reality he thought he knew begins to come under assault, both from external factors and from bits of memory that come back to him.  I won't say more, because the movie wants you to slowly unravel its mysteries.  I won't spoil them, although I think they are not terribly inventive in the long run.  Eventually, other characters are introduced, and they are not well fleshed out, even for a sci-fi story.  Olga Kurylenko appears and I left to wonder again (as I did for QUANTUM OF SOLACE and HIT MAN) how she gets large movie roles.  She is bland and uninteresting.  Morgan Freeman is on hand, but does little more than talk like Freeman...it's barely a performance.I'll say again, it's a good thing the experienced and engaging Cruise is on hand to be our tour guide.  With a less compelling star, the less-original-than-its-creators-think plot and the mostly non-existent character development would doom this film.  As it is, I found enough here to like and to recommend the film.  I give it 3.5 stars, but will round up to 4.",4,"Gorgeous scenery, a charismatic Cruise and a so-so plot.",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,3606,"['OBLIVION', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'look', 'marvel', 'brown', 'gray', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'charismatic', 'movie', 'star', 'two', 'elements', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'good', 'thing', 'OBLIVION', 'things', 'going', 'because', 'much', 'rest', 'so-so', 'best.I', 'appreciated', 'steady', 'slow-paced', 'build', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'action', 'heavy', 'short', 'one', 'extended', 'disjointed', 'shootout', 'underground', 'bunker', 'facility', 'really', 'mostly', 'spend', 'LOT', 'time', 'closeup', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'gorgeously', 'ravaged', 'earth', 'him.We', 'meet', 'Cruise', 'setting', 'out', 'drone', 'repair', 'mission', 'earth', 'earth', 'was', 'essentially', 'obliterated', 'war', 'alien', 'invaders', 'won', 'war', 'had', 'abandon', 'ruined', 'planet', 'Cruise', 'partner/lover', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'are', 'alone', 'station', 'build', 'well', 'surface', 'planet', 'cities', 'farmlands', 'are', 'covered', 'dunes', 'top', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'surface', 'most', 'rest', 'NYC', 'buried', 'Offshore', 'gigantic', 'machines', 'serviced', 'drones', 'are', 'pulling', 'up', 'water', 'oceans', 'are', 'used', 'up', 'fusion', 'process', 'bring', 'energy', 'Saturn', 'moon', 'Titan', 'where', 'remnants', 'humanity', 'have', 'fled.Riseborough', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'who', 'interesting', 'striking', 'figure', 'station', 'Cruise', 'spend', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'earth', 'memories', 'planet', 'infinite', 'interest', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'there', 'passion', 'work', 'planet', 'are', 'what', 'draw', 'character', 'Cruise', 'seldom', 'truly', 'great', 'actor', 'one', 'stars', 'Clooney', 'who', 'are', 'charismatic', 'engaging', 'Cruise', 'usually', 'helped', 'having', 'character', 'dark', 'side', 'past', 'get', 'hints', 'great', 'physical', 'assurance', 'AND', 'air', 'sadness.And', 'earth', 'bleak', 'nearly', 'empty', 'CGI', 'wonder', 'know', 'almost', 'completely', 'fake', 'special', 'effects', 'teams', 'have', 'done', 'stellar', 'job', 'creating', 'convincing', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'lovely', 'look', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Cruise', ""'m"", 'so', 'tired', 'bloated', 'CGI', 'worlds', 'be', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Thor', 'home', 'planet', 'other', 'gilded', 'over-stuffed', 'fantasy', 'world', 'OBLIVION', 'tasteful', 'color', 'palette', 'Riseborough', 'clothing', 'hue', 'sand', 'dunes', 'soothing', 'creative.Needless', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'Cruise', 'flying', 'around', 'earth', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'reality', 'thought', 'knew', 'begins', 'come', 'assault', 'external', 'factors', 'bits', 'memory', 'back', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'movie', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'think', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'inventive', 'long', 'run', 'Eventually', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'even', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'left', 'wonder', 'again', 'did', 'QUANTUM', 'OF', 'SOLACE', 'HIT', 'MAN', 'how', 'large', 'movie', 'roles', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'hand', 'little', 'more', 'talk', 'Freeman', 'barely', 'performance.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'good', 'thing', 'experienced', 'engaging', 'Cruise', 'hand', 'be', 'tour', 'guide', 'less', 'compelling', 'star', 'less-original-than-its-creators-think', 'plot', 'mostly', 'non-existent', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'doom', 'film', 'found', 'enough', 'here', 'like', 'recommend', 'film', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'will', 'round', 'up', '4']",N/A
1558811,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B008JFUO36,Robert Badgley,"[0, 3]","Oblivion(released April/13)stars,among others,Tom Cruise,Olga Kurylenko,Andrea Riseborough,Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.Oblivion is certainly a different film,and Cruise is back doing what he does best;playing the intense,somber but conflicted role we know him to o so well.While he and co stars have a lot to say and do,the ultra long story has just far too much to tell,as it jumps from one narrative to another and back again.It unfortunately drags the film down and us with it.Speaking of which,we find ourselves in the year 2070.Earth is in total shambles and our hero is living high above the Earth with his female counterpart.They are singly manning the maintenance and security of the planet after its devastation involving a global conflict with aliens some 60 years before.There are gigantic water sucking machines that provide needed energy for the Earth colony on the moon of Titan,the largest of Saturn's moons.To aid the pair in their tasks are drones,round flying machines that help the pair cover the long distances involved in their jobs.They are monitored constantly from the &#34;Tet&#34;,a gigantic space ship,which is the transition platform for those heading from Earth to Titan.In fact Cruise and his colleague are due to leave their posts in two weeks,barring any complications.Cruise has been bombarded for ages by memories of a woman he met on top of the Empire State building.One day they pick up a transmission coming from the top of that same building;the rest of which is buried deep beneath in the ground.He investigates to find out it has been deliberately programmed for transmission into space and for coordinates in a zone on Earth where there is no known life to speak of.Cruise cuts the signal,but shortly there after a space craft falls from the sky.Upon his arrival at the crash site he manages to rescue a woman from a stasis tube.A drone,also dispatched to the area from the Tet,kills the remaining survivors,much to his chagrin.The woman,as it turns out,is the self same one from Cruise's dreams.Cruise returns the tube to his habitat high above the Earth.They bring the woman back to life and interrogate her as best they can.Her main concern is getting the flight recorder from her crashed ship.Reluctantly Cruise takes her planet side and both get taken prisoners by Scavengers,or Scavs for short.It is these people that Cruise has been told were of alien origin and the ones that still sabotage their equipment.The Scavs however have a different story to tell.They are not of alien origin but human,and have been fighting the real aliens for years;the ones from the Tet who invaded Earth originally.They(the Scavs)want to send a destructive device into the Tet and blow it up,but they need Cruise to program a drone for them.When he refuses they send him and the woman he revived back into the wilderness to find answers in a radiation zone no one has been able to enter.Along the way the two stop at the Empire State Building again where the woman rekindles his memories further,only to find she is his wife.Cruise's partner has sent his ship back down to him and sees the two in an embrace.When Cruise returns to the habitat she refuses his entry and reports him to their superiors.This has the effect of unleashing a special drone underneath the habitat which first kills Cruise's colleague then turns on him.He is saved by his wife.The two flee but get pursued by three drones.Cruise manages to eliminate the three but not before he crash lands in the so called radiation zone.There his wife gets seriously wounded and  he finds out there are more caretakers like himself.In fact he witnesses one land and perform maintenance on a drone.It is in fact a clone of himself.While Cruise's official number is 49,this one's is 52.Cruise kills the clone,returns to the clone's habitat#52,greets his former colleague(obviously a clone also),and returns to Earth with a med kit to help save his wife's life.Armed with this new knowledge Cruise and his wife return to the Scavs and agree to help them defeat the aliens.Before they can get a programmed drone up and fling with the installed nuclear device,they are attacked by three more clones.Many people are killed,and its leader seriously wounded.The only option now is to take the bomb up to the Tet personally.Cruise puts his wife back into the stasis tube and blasts off to take her back to the Tet.Along the way he listens to the flight recorder which brings back more memories from his former life.Cruise now knows it was he who led the original expedition to Titan but was side tracked to investigate the Tet.Cruise ejected the stasis tubes on board before his ship was sucked into the Tet.The aliens then cloned Cruise and what would become his female colleague.The aliens sent thousands of Cruises to Earth to destroy the human population and left a few behind to tend to the planet destroying water devices.Cruise manages to enter the heart of the Tet.When he opens the stasis tube it is the leader of the Scavs.Both Cruise and he detonate the bomb together destroying the aliens.Fast forward two years and Cruises wife and their daughter are now living in a remote cabin on Earth Cruise had built prior to his death.Out of some brush across a lake arrives some Scavs and Cruise,but the numbered 52 clone,the one we thought Cruise had killed.It seems his memories had been awakened by Cruise#49 and his wife's presence and he had been searching for her ever since.There is much more to this plot,but as you can tell,it is long and very involved and we are taken back and forth,from one story to a back story,and back again and on and on.There are certainly some head scratching moments as when we get fooled by Freeman's presence in the Tet,and clone#52's appearance at the end as he&#34;reunites&#34; with his wife.Also when we view the back story and see Cruise eject the stasis tubes from his ship which is getting sucked into the Tet,we must ask:why wasn't the ejected section also sucked into the ship?Cruise has tried everything in his power to get out of the TET's grip and failed,but an ejecting part of the ship miraculously could break away of its own power? Hmmm.And there is also the question of clones,as in how many more were out there with latent memories of Cruises wife and when they came searching what would they do when they found their wife? Hmmmm.Questions,questions and more questions,with no answers.Or should I say a lot of plot holes that are quite deep?You decide.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include three featurettes,deleted scenes and commentary.All in all while a nice looking film,it is more style without substance.Its long and involved plot gets you clock watching part way through and wriggling in your seat.This film is unfotunately not the sum of its parts.Nice try,but no cigars.3 -3 1/2 stars.",3,A long and involved story hampers this flicker!,1385769600,"11 30,

But no, we are continually dished up visual extravaganzas that have about as much originality as a 50s cowboy formula flick.This is a film about an outpost, run by Cruise and his girlfriend, which they believe is an outpost that will enable humans to colonize a moon and start over after a devastating war with a mysterious alien race.  The way that they live is fantastically vivid, as are the automated weapons that Cruise maintains to protect huge fusion reactors visible across the horizon.  It is a good life, but they are doing time, waiting to rejoin their cohorts on a space station.  Nonetheless, amidst his dangerous work routine, Cruise is disturbed by visions, seemingly old memories, of a girl he once loved, even though his memory has been ""wiped"" to protect information he purportedly has about the satellite.Things, it seems, are not what they appear.  And, of course, they turn out not to be.  On the positive side, the actors are good.  I am a Cruise fan, and Kurylenko and Morgan Freedman give strong performances, too.  I do not want to reveal the surprise explanation, and there are some nice twists, but really, once you have seen this you will not want to watch it over and over - there is not much to savor, beyond dazzling visuals and Cruise-style action.

The previews rock my world only to find I can't sit through fifteen minutes. Grrh! Oblivion had a couple things going for it before I even pressed play. Science fiction and Tom Cruise. I live for end of the world survival drama and Tom's been one of my favorite actors since Legend.The movie starts off with a 12 Monkeys vibe because the opening scene is a glimpse of the past. Tell me you all saw that movie. It is one of the best of all time. The pacing is slow with long looks and minimal dialogue, but the tech is sleek and sexy. Everything is white or feels white, clean, even the ruins, but then darkness and unknowns are thrown in, which is the least flashy way a movie can create conflict and I loved it. Quiet spooky stuff. Then the music came into play, and I was thrown into a Terminator vibe. Very futuristic everyone is going to die via machine kind of way. I loved it! I was completely creeped out. Tom played one of his most subdued roles ever, almost funny at times. Morgan Freemen excels at that and he did here too. There's a mystery to be solved, humanity to save, and the last man on earth to get laid. Okay, Tom's not the last man on earth, but here he is getting some and the world has ended! That was a little too much, but at least it was very understated, which pays respect to how sci-fi movies should be. Except when it comes to the modern version of Battlestar Galatica. They had the best sex scenes.4.5 stars for Oblivion and I'm sure I'll watch it again because it's that cool. One more movie vibe reference. Wall-E.

Even though the humans technically &#8220;won&#8221; the war (using nuclear weapons which pretty much wiped everything out), most of the planet&#8217;s survivors have long since moved to a colony on one of Saturn&#8217;s moons, leaving behind only a handful of people, like Tom Cruise&#8217;s Commander Jack Harper, as part of the &#8220; mop-up crew,&#8221; whose job is to repair drones and to make sure the alien remnant known as the &#8220;scavengers&#8221; don&#8217;t interfere with the continued production of fusion power from the oceans that is needed by the humans living up on Titan.Complications arise when Jack rescues a female flight commander (Olga Kurylenko) whose vehicle is shot down by Scavs. Trouble is he thinks he may remember her from a time before he had his memory &#8220;swiped&#8221; as a needed security precaution given the sensitive nature of his job and mission.&#8220;Oblivion&#8221; is a visually elegant film from director Joseph Kosinski, adapted from his graphic novel, which was never published.

No doubt that whatever quality exists in Oblivion is due to the fact that director Joseph Kosinski was permitted to direct his own graphic-novel source material, and thus stay true to the sci-fi heart of the story.  I feel that discussing much of the plot very quickly gets into spoiler territory.  The set-up: Earth has been attacked by aliens, but humans have won the battle--at the cost of the Earth's habitability.  Remaining humans are being offloaded from the planet to a giant space station, while a few &#34;techs&#34; (Cruise) hunt down the last aliens (savages or &#34;Savs&#34;).Special effects are more than acceptable for a current product.

I was a little disappointed with it the first time I saw it, but watched it again several hours later and found that I appreciated it more and was able to ignore some of the holes in the plot (and it would be hard to describe them without giving away too much).  The main things are these:  It's handsomely, even spectacularly, made with an interesting premise, a lot of fascinating action between the characters, and a thoroughly satisfying resolution.  And I feel that those who rip this movie apart do so because it wasn't what they expected.  I hate to label it a thinking person's film, but to some degree it is, which is surprising, since it is based on a graphic novel and some of the action scenes seem straight out of a high tech video game.  But that's just a small part of it and most of the film revolves around intriguing characters. The director has created an amazing world here, with very good acting and some spectacular effects.  I went back and watched it a third time and liked it even more and intend to add the Blu-ray to my collection.  This is an excellent movie, and I just don't understand some of the hostility that has been directed towards it.  I think that it's a triumph for director Kosinsky and his wonderful crew.Follow-up: I did indeed buy it here on Blu-ray, and think of it as just short of 5 stars -- and I swear that my eyes fill with tears during the final moments every single time I've watched it!

BUT OBLIVION is an aimlessly talky movie which seems purposeless and confusing, TC's acting is fine, though subdued. I wonder if shooting in Iceland froze his typical enthusiasm.Why did he agree to participate in such a pretty yet bland project?I have a theory: TC seems impulsive and on occasion a victim of his own raving enthusiasm. According to OBLIVION's 'Making of' Feature, TC was shown a graphic novel of Oblivion to illustrate the movie's potential/look and was blown away. And so signed on. The graphics he saw were indeed good. As great as the movie isn't. The 'Making of' feature has Cruise and company swooning over the design of eating utensils, chairs, costumes, imagined ships and stations. So, in a decorator haze he must've green-lighted the production. If he saw a script and read it, he must've been glowing in that initial haze, or he fell asleep.Oblivion's plot and Dialogue, in today's parlance, simply suck. Acting isnumb and occasionally dumb while the the entertainment quotient slurps.I saw another recent TC filmJack Reacher (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy). It's Great. Smart, sophisticated plot, dialogue, acting and action (TC's martial arts are especially real, good too; sure seemed he was the bad-guy thrasher, no stand-in as far as I saw). I gave it five stars, wishing more stars were allowed. I've seen it three times; (I'm retired from media; study production values. TC's JR film is fine the first time, even better in multiple viewings. See it, you'll see how well it's made...Circuitous + inane = Boring, frustrating and irritating.

This move gives subtle spoofs on Tom Cruises late movie (TOP GUN), and is a (half-baked) twisted modification of the late (2001 Space Odyssey). This movie is both stunning and disappointing at the same time. I think this movie could have been a huge hit, if it was more hardcore, bloody, and had strange creatures in it. Furthermore, the drab, dull and boring love story portrayed in this film did nothing for the movie, accept destroy it. Morgan Freeman is way too powerful of an actor to be in a movie like this. This is why his roll was short lived. Morgan Freeman practically cancelled out Tom Cruise, and seemed out of place in a movie like this. Overall, the cutting edge CGI effects in this movie were stunning! And the sci-fi (futuristic other worldly) panoramic sky, land, and sea scape's were also very stunning and brilliant. There are some dull, dry and boring areas in this movie; however its sheer sophistication will hold your attention. Based on the impact of the high quality production of this movie, I have to give it a solid (5) star rating, even though its really a disappointment in the end. The storyline has numerous holes, and leaves you with more questions than answers...in actuality the movie really doesn't make any sense at all, and will leave you scratching your head. However, for the sake of pure entertainment, its great. This movie has NO similarities to Star Wars, Tron, and Transfromers...at all! But you (WILL) see profound influences from 2001 Space Odyssey...I can promise you that. Those are the facts.

1558858,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B008JFUO36,"Scotman's Critic's Corner ""Film & Book Reviewer""","[0, 0]","[THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.]""Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the ""mop-up crew"".If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him.The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer.Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to ""management"" up in ""Tat"", a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan.And every morning the communication from Tat asks , ""Are you an effective team?"" and all hell will break loose if it's other than ""Yes!""Who could ask for more?There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems.Plots and Points:I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking - New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria.When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit ""pre-War"", and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones!Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed.IMAX, was worth it!Cast & Crew:Directed byJoseph KosinskiWriting creditsJoseph Kosinski (screenplay) andKarl Gajdusek (screenplay) andMichael Arndt (screenplay)CastTom Cruise ...

Rarely is he in a very deep or thought-provoking movie in this genre. (vanilla sky is one exception that comes to mind) Oblivion is good fun as &#34;sci-fi lite&#34; for when you want a fix without a labyrinthine plot. Basically the polar opposite of something like Blade Runner or Children of Men. (side note: I'm not sure I can name a movie where Tom Cruise disappeared into a role... he's always the same, good or bad you always just see him.)Having said that, this movie has visual style to burn and is not without &#34;twists&#34; in the story. Everything is telegraphed prior to revelation and thus not much is terribly shocking for anyone that treads the science fiction waters regularly, but it is a solid movie. That's not to say that some won't miss those tells and be thus surprised at times... it is a well done movie with good talent all around. (yes, even Tom Cruise most of the time) Most reviews were overly harsh and similar to 2010's Tron Legacy, this was raked over the coals without giving it a chance. (Which may be more telling that you first think as they both were directed by Joseph Kosinski) It is allot of fun, especially when watching with others and the aforementioned popcorn. It is enjoyable.I did mention style, and it truly oozes a visual flair that makes the world come alive. (or bleakly dead, depending on how you look at it) It comes from a comic (ahem, graphic novel!) and keeps that saturated look to it, which is a great feast on larger TVs. It is worth Buying Blurray over DVD without question. Note that this is not style over substance (say like Ultraviolet or Chronicles of Riddick) and this still runs plot circles around those types of movie. More-so, when stood up against most things from Marvel (which are firmly planted in the 'unsurprising-but-enjoyable' popcorn category) and everything from Michael Bay (which is in the 'throw-money-at-the-screen-and-don't-even-bother-to-stitch-it-together-intelligently' category) then this movie looks positively stellar.Bottom Line: If you like action-sci-fi with great visual flair and decent story then this is worth seeing.",4,"Fun, popcorn sci-fi",1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2201,"['mean', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Any', 'movie', 'never', 'anyone', 'else', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Rarely', 'very', 'deep', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'genre', 'vanilla', 'sky', 'one', 'exception', 'mind', 'Oblivion', 'good', 'fun', '34', 'sci-fi', 'lite', '34', 'when', 'want', 'fix', 'labyrinthine', 'plot', 'Basically', 'polar', 'opposite', 'something', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Children', 'Men', 'side', 'note', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'name', 'movie', 'where', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'disappeared', 'role', 'always', 'same', 'good', 'bad', 'always', 'just', 'see', 'Having', 'said', 'movie', 'visual', 'style', 'burn', 'not', '34', 'twists', '34', 'story', 'Everything', 'telegraphed', 'prior', 'revelation', 'thus', 'not', 'much', 'terribly', 'shocking', 'anyone', 'science', 'fiction', 'waters', 'regularly', 'solid', 'movie', 'not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'tells', 'be', 'thus', 'surprised', 'times', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'good', 'talent', 'around', 'yes', 'even', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'most', 'time', 'Most', 'reviews', 'were', 'overly', 'harsh', 'similar', '2010', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'raked', 'coals', 'giving', 'chance', 'Which', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'telling', 'first', 'think', 'were', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'allot', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'watching', 'others', 'aforementioned', 'popcorn', 'enjoyable.I', 'did', 'mention', 'style', 'truly', 'visual', 'flair', 'world', 'come', 'alive', 'bleakly', 'dead', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'comic', 'ahem', 'graphic', 'novel', 'saturated', 'look', 'great', 'feast', 'larger', 'TVs', 'worth', 'Buying', 'Blurray', 'DVD', 'question', 'Note', 'not', 'style', 'substance', 'say', 'Ultraviolet', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'still', 'plot', 'circles', 'types', 'movie', 'More-so', 'when', 'stood', 'up', 'most', 'things', 'Marvel', 'are', 'firmly', 'planted', ""'unsurprising-but-enjoyable"", 'popcorn', 'category', 'everything', 'Michael', 'Bay', ""'throw-money-at-the-screen-and-don't-even-bother-to-stitch-it-together-intelligently"", 'category', 'then', 'movie', 'positively', 'stellar.Bottom', 'Line', 'like', 'action-sci-fi', 'great', 'visual', 'flair', 'decent', 'story', 'then', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

1558905,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B008JFUO36,Steve Douglas,"[3, 4]","All my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from Standard Def DVD quality to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO....The video transfer is nothing short of excellent.  Colors are very realistic and contrast is excellent allowing you to see very small detailing in the background and foreground.  In a few of the darker and shadow scenes, details were not lost. Blacks are fully deep and no banding can be seen in either the blacks or sky shots which is often where you would see such banding.  Color saturation has been boosted a touch but nothing that distracts from the imaging.  At no point did I notice any CGI haloing or artificiality within the image itself.  Being a newer film, the blu ray was free from artifacts or dropouts of any kind.  Mbps rate stayed in the steady mid thirties.  Even this could have been improved without the 3 video ads and 2 movie previews.( Will get to those later)AUDIO....So glad that production houses are finally starting to include a 7.1 audio mix.  This is the first Blu Ray I have seen that actually defaults to the 7.1 audio.  If your system is still a 5.1 system, not to fret, the additional 6th and 7th channels will be muxed to feed into your 4th and 5th rear channels without any issues.  The lossless DTS HD MA 7.1 audio mix is quite excellent with a wide use of discreet directionality to your surrounds with much panning between the front and rear stages to create an enveloping film and aural experience.  Your LFE channel will not be ignored as there is plenty in this film that will keep it occupied.  Dialogue is clear and transparent and foley effects absolutely delineated for your ears.  There will be no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control once you set it to your liking.EXTRAS...The one clearly negative thing about this Blu Ray is that there are 2 ads and 3 previews of other films. You are paying for their advertising which takes up room on the Blu Ray calling for even more video compression in order to fit it all in. Who wants to pay for an  advertisement ? Not me, I'd rather have an improved video transfer with less compression.The real extras are deleted scenes which were good enough to make for an extended version and a 'Making of' documentary divided up into several parts covering the creation of the ships, stunt work which Tom Cruise takes pride in doing, the inception of the film and more.  Additionally, there is a separate musical score you can listen to.The digital copy that is included allows you to download via Ultra Violet, which I do not like, or to iTunes which I do.  I am glad that I have the choice to go one way or the other with this.This is an FX laden Science Fiction film.  To be honest, I must say that I was disappointed in the movie itself.  I was thinking that it was a Sci Fi 'chick flick' but I know many will disagree.  Effects are great but a movie should be about the characters and storyline and not FX.  Never the less, the production values of this Blu Ray are outstanding and well worth purchasing  despite the included advertisements.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",5,Oblivion on Blu Ray,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,3914,"['many', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'quality', 'higher', 'standard', 'set', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Summaries', 'plot', 'opinions', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'majority', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'redundant.Keep', 'mind', 'however', 'quality', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'dependent', 'quality', 'TV', 'monitor', 'are', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'theater', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'using', 'monitor', 'use', 'fairly', 'new', 'Panasonic', 'ZT', '65', 'plasma', 'amps', 'speakers', 'cables', 'BluRay', 'player', 'Surround', 'Processor', 'use', 'are', 'hi', 'end', 'esoteric', 'gear', 'provide', 'more', 'realistic', 'objective', 'perspective.VIDEO', '.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'Colors', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'contrast', 'excellent', 'allowing', 'see', 'very', 'small', 'detailing', 'background', 'foreground', 'few', 'darker', 'shadow', 'scenes', 'details', 'were', 'not', 'lost', 'Blacks', 'are', 'fully', 'deep', 'banding', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'blacks', 'sky', 'shots', 'often', 'where', 'would', 'see', 'such', 'banding', 'Color', 'saturation', 'been', 'boosted', 'touch', 'nothing', 'imaging', 'point', 'did', 'notice', 'CGI', 'haloing', 'artificiality', 'image', 'Being', 'newer', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'was', 'free', 'artifacts', 'dropouts', 'kind', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'stayed', 'steady', 'mid', 'thirties', 'Even', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', '3', 'video', 'ads', '2', 'movie', 'previews', 'Will', 'get', 'later', 'AUDIO', '.So', 'glad', 'production', 'houses', 'are', 'finally', 'starting', 'include', '7.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'first', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'have', 'seen', 'actually', 'defaults', '7.1', 'audio', 'system', 'still', '5.1', 'system', 'not', 'fret', 'additional', '6th', '7th', 'channels', 'will', 'be', 'muxed', 'feed', '4th', '5th', 'rear', 'channels', 'issues', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '7.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'quite', 'excellent', 'wide', 'use', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'surrounds', 'much', 'panning', 'front', 'rear', 'stages', 'create', 'enveloping', 'film', 'aural', 'experience', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'plenty', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'occupied', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'transparent', 'foley', 'effects', 'absolutely', 'delineated', 'ears', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'need', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remote', 'volume', 'control', 'once', 'set', 'liking.EXTRAS', 'one', 'clearly', 'negative', 'thing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', '2', 'ads', '3', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'paying', 'advertising', 'up', 'room', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'calling', 'even', 'more', 'video', 'compression', 'order', 'fit', 'Who', 'pay', 'advertisement', 'Not', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'improved', 'video', 'transfer', 'less', 'compression.The', 'real', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'extended', 'version', ""'Making"", 'documentary', 'divided', 'up', 'several', 'parts', 'covering', 'creation', 'ships', 'stunt', 'work', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'pride', 'doing', 'inception', 'film', 'more', 'Additionally', 'separate', 'musical', 'score', 'can', 'listen', 'to.The', 'digital', 'copy', 'included', 'allows', 'download', 'Ultra', 'Violet', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'iTunes', 'do', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'choice', 'go', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'this.This', 'FX', 'laden', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'Sci', 'Fi', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'Effects', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'characters', 'storyline', 'not', 'FX', 'less', 'production', 'values', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', 'outstanding', 'well', 'purchasing', 'included', 'advertisements.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'focused', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'HELP', 'well.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

1558913,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUO36,StrangePegs,"[5, 6]","So here's the spoiler warning, because I'm not going to try to not talk about aspects of the movie, so, if you think, like me, that the movie looks cool and you're probably going to watch it anyway despite what I say (just don't do it. really), you shouldn't read this. If you want to know about all of the dumb (you should!), read on.I realize this isn't an issue for some people, but it is for me, as I've mentioned before: The movie did that opening narration thing to explain what's going on. I'm convinced that opening narration is almost always a bad thing. If you have to have it, you have either (1) started your movie in the wrong place (2) failed to provide information within the movie in a way that works for the viewer. The Star Wars movies are one of the few places where you can find effective opening narration (in the form of the prologue scroll). And, then, not only did Oblivion open with the narration providing the viewer with an out-of-character monologue of events, but all of that same information was provided about halfway through the movie in almost exactly the same format. Please, do not provide me the same information more than once in your movie. I can almost guarantee you that I got it the first time (which is why I tell my kids to not repeat themselves when they do something they find funny: I did just see it happen).Despite the opening narration, the movie doesn't make much sense. Ostensibly, Jack and Victoria are a team placed on Earth to defend these large fusion reactors, but, really, why are they needed? There's actually no good reason for them to be there. Sure, sure, he's some technician who has to repair the drones, but that's flimsy at best, because that whole set up is just to support the fact that they want this character that doesn't have any memories, but from any kind of logical standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, it might (almost) make sense if the stated premise of the movie was true, but you know it's not, because, even if it was, what would be the point of erasing the memories of the support teams? However, with the knowledge that the aliens are really in charge, there is absolutely no good reason to have things set up the way they are. Why do they need humans to repair their drones? And why, after the Jack clones fought for them as their army when they took over the Earth, do they need to trick the clones into believing they're normal humans anyway?Then there's the problem of Jack having this whole wilderness retreat that he's built, somehow, without anyone finding out. He's able to just turn off the tracking unit in his (what I'm calling) dragonfly ship (which  is very cool, by the way) and go &#34;off comm.&#34; What the heck? His navigator person (who never leaves &#34;the tower&#34;) doesn't have any idea where he is when he does this and neither do the aliens. Seriously? They just allow him to go off and do secret things without bothering to know what he's up to. Completely implausible. Sure, it makes sense if you believe the story as it's presented at the beginning of the movie, but, again, you know that's not the whole story fairly quickly, and the idea that the aliens (or whatever) would just allow this is beyond imagining. It's what the writer/director do to support the lie and get the audience to buy into it, but those things need to make sense after the truth is revealed, too.Jack has these dreams... dreams of being in New York before it was destroyed, but that was 50 or so years ago, and he's not that old. My wife kept joking about them being &#34;clone dreams&#34; because, at that point, we were trying to go along with what the movie was telling us. Trying. But we both knew she was right. Right in that being what the movie was going to say they were: memories of Jack's life before he was cloned by the aliens. Seriously? This isn't the 80s anymore, and we already knew in the 80s, even in sci-fi, that clones don't get the memories of the being they were cloned from. The memory flashes work if his mind really was &#34;wiped&#34; before his mission, but it doesn't work as some remnant from his genetic donor. It's just dumb. Why can't we seem to get past this stupid idea that clones have the memory of whatever they were cloned from? (And, again, I just have to point out that Star Wars does not do this, the only sci-fi clone movie I can think of that doesn't fall back on that tired idea.)Also, the drones, which can follow Jack's &#34;DNA trail&#34; (really? we leave a trail of DNA in the atmosphere even when we're in an enclosed, airtight vessel?) have a problem with his voice identification and consider killing him more than once. I suppose they can't sense his DNA when he gets too close. That's only a long-range thing. (Do you sense the sarcasm there?)And there's the bit where the drones are flying through the human hideout blasting everyone into cinders but, when one of them corners Jack's wife, Julia (introduced only to be a princess-in-the-tower character), and a bunch of other humans in a dead-end corridor, it pauses and decided to scan them. Again, really? The drone, programmed to kill humans, suddenly needs to stop and scan them? For just long enough for it to get exploded from behind, of course.And, after all of that, we're not even up to the stupidest part of the movie. I know! I see your jaws hanging. The stupidest part is when he finally flies up to the alien ship, this huge, upside-down pyramid thing, and it's just full of vast expanses of space on the inside! When did this become a thing and what kind of sense does it make? So, yeah, he's flying through this huge space and, every once in a while, he has to fly through an opening in a wall, and the walls are covered in clone pods. The only other things in the huge alien space ship are drones. No aliens. And, when he finally gets to the center to arrive at &#34;Sally,&#34; it's just another inverted pyramid thing with a flashing (talking?) red light. NO ALIENS! So tell me why they needed to take over the Earth and use it as a source of material for their fusion reactors IF THERE ARE ACTUALLY NO ALIENS? And, if that's all they needed, why didn't they just stop at any of the unpopulated planets on the way into the solar system? Wouldn't that have been so much easier than having to fight a bunch of humans for the materials they wanted? AND WHERE WERE THE ALIENS?There was also an even more stupidest part. The part where somehow the flight recorder from Jack's spaceship from when he first got captured by the alien ship went from being in the command module, recording what was happening, to being in the sleeping quarters of the ship even though the sleeping portion had been jettisoned. Because that makes all the sense.The acting, though, wasn't bad. Not great but not bad, either. And the tech was decently cool. But there was a reason (many of them, actually, as I've pointed out) the movie didn't make back its production budget domestically. So, unless you just have to prove to yourself how dumb the movie is, this is not one I could suggest to anyone.",2,Obliviated,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,7092,"['So', 'here', 'spoiler', 'warning',

1558914,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B008JFUO36,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[2, 5]","My favorite directors these days are people who know how to use their medium to tell a story. For too long we've been stuck with films that basically point a hand-hel camera at the actors and pay no regard to things like cinematography and audio design. But now great film-making seems to be coming back into style. On the forefront of this return to good old-fashioned great film-making that would make Capra and Ford proud are three directors. Joe Wright (who single-handedly revitalized Jane Austin films), Andrew Niccol (who keeps making us question everything we know by pushing an idea to its logical limit), and now Joseph Kosinski (who now with his second film shows that his unique style is here to stay).Trying to describe Oblivion is at once easy and impossible. It borrowers heavily from every sci-fi trope imaginable, and yet feels like a breath of fresh air. It's by-the-numbers and yet feels quite original. But one thing is for sure. If you like this sort of film you will find that it's very, very good.When Tron Legacy came out a lot of people thought it had no plot, no depth, lousy acting, etc, etc. I happily pointed out to these people that all the depth of the movie was under the surface, in the subtly of the camera angles, the expressions on faces, the words quickly spoken that might be missed on the first viewing. You had to pay attention to catch the real story, which was told through visuals and use of music. This was greatly aided by the fact that the film was cut to the music instead of the other way round. Watching Oblivion I can say that exactly the same thing is true. There is a great story, but it's not told through monologs and conversations. It's told through the visuals, the music, and overall FEEL of a scene. Again, the music propels the film, giving very powerful emotion to scenes. And like Tron Legacy, this movie is so pretty visually and musically that you'll want to buy the soundtrack and the Blu-Ray.Some people watched the trailer and thought it gave away the plot of the movie. It ain't so. The trailer gives away the first five minutes. In this movie nothing is as it first appears, and while you may see the plots twists coming, they are still done exceptionally well (both times I saw the film in the theater I started laughing at key moments because the way a plot twist was handled was so dang awesome).The strength and weakness of this film is the obvious. It rips bits and pieces from everything from Wall-E to Star Trek:The Motion Picture and the game Portal. Mostly though, if you've seen Tron:Legacy it will remind you of that film. From the austere clean sci-fi feel of buildings and drones, to the strong resemblance between Quorra and Julia, from the barrel-rolling dog-fight chase scene to a final climactic confrontation with ""the creator"" set to blasting triumphant music, it all feels very similar. But in this case, it's definitely not a bad thing. Both movies are amazing and well worth watching repeatedly.",5,A Triumph of Audio/Visual Style to Tell a Good Story,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,2985,"['favorite', 'directors', 'days', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'medium', 'tell', 'story', 'too', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stuck', 'films', 'basically', 'point', 'hand-hel', 'camera', 'actors', 'pay', 'regard', 'things', 'cinematography', 'audio', 'design', 'now', 'great', 'film-making', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'style', 'forefront', 'return', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'great', 'film-making', 'would', 'make', 'Capra', 'Ford', 'proud', 'are', 'three', 'directors', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'revitalized', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'films', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'who', 'making', 'question', 'everything', 'know', 'pushing', 'idea', 'logical', 'limit', 'now', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'who', 'now', 'second', 'film', 'shows', 'unique', 'style', 'here', 'stay', '.Trying', 'describe', 'Oblivion', 'once', 'easy', 'impossible', 'heavily', 'sci-fi', 'trope', 'imaginable', 'yet', 'feels', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'by-the-numbers', 'yet', 'feels', 'quite', 'original', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'like', 'sort', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'very', 'good.When', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'came', 'out', 'lot', 'people', 'thought', 'had', 'plot', 'depth', 'lousy', 'acting', 'etc', 'etc', 'happily', 'pointed', 'out', 'people', 'depth', 'movie', 'was', 'surface', 'subtly', 'camera', 'expressions', 'words', 'quickly', 'spoken', 'might', 'be', 'missed', 'first', 'viewing', 'had', 'pay', 'attention', 'catch', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'visuals', 'use', 'music', 'was', 'greatly', 'aided', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'music', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'round', 'Watching', 'Oblivion', 'can', 'say', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'true', 'great', 'story', 'not', 'told', 'monologs', 'conversations', 'told', 'visuals', 'music', 'overall', 'FEEL', 'scene', 'Again', 'music', 'film', 'giving', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'movie', 'so', 'pretty', 'visually', 'musically', ""'ll"", 'want', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'Blu-Ray.Some', 'people', 'watched', 'trailer', 'thought', 'gave', 'away', 'plot', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'trailer', 'away', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'nothing', 'first', 'may', 'see', 'plots', 'twists', 'coming', 'are', 'still', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'times', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'started', 'laughing', 'key', 'moments', 'way', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'handled', 'was', 'so', 'dang', 'awesome', '.The', 'strength', 'weakness', 'film', 'obvious', 'bits', 'pieces', 'everything', 'Wall-E', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'game', 'Portal', 'Mostly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'will', 'remind', 'film', 'austere', 'clean', 'sci-fi', 'feel', 'buildings', 'drones', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Quorra', 'Julia', 'barrel-rolling', 'dog-fight', 'chase', 'scene', 'final', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'creator', 'set', 'blasting', 'triumphant', 'music', 'feels', 'very', 'similar', 'case', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'movies', 'are', 'amazing', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'repeatedly']",N/A

We are given the background: Aliens called Scavengers or ""Scavs"" destroyed the moon. The earth went into turmoil. We managed to defeat them through the use of nuclear weapons. With our planet uninhabitable, our people went to live on Titan. An orbiting triangle space station gives orders to Jack whose mission is to maintain an army of drones used to hunt the remnants of the scavengers.Jack's memory was erased in case aliens capture him. He has dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko)in NYC from a time long before the invasion. About the time Morgan Freeman shows up, things tie together, we get the twist, and the film takes off in a different direction.The characters in the film are dry. The dialouge was boring. The action moved slow with the film definitely being too long. I enjoyed the one early scene where Cruise attempts a ""Mission Impossible"" type of escape, one that fails. The cinematography was great with a decent story line. If you love science fiction and are tired of those SyFy films, this is a welcomed change with neat killer drones and landscapes.I am sure Cruise didn't have to beat himself up too much to accept the role of Luke Skywalker, Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith, Independence), and Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, Armageddon) all wrapped into one as he saves the world from alien invaders. This film is an obvious Scientology film just like ""Battlefield Earth"". Tom Cruise believes, according to ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief"" that he will actually save the planet from alien invaders.

While the similarities between Oblivion and Top Gun end at the aforementioned, there is no question that ""Maverick"" has all the right moves to portray galactic mechanic, Jack Harper in the most visually dazzling film of the year so far.Oblivion opens in 2077 after an alien threat has left Earth a barren wasteland fit only for extracting a few vital resources before humanity abandons the planet altogether to start a new existence on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cruise's Harper is a glorified serviceman who supervises and repairs the various resource-extraction devices along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). As the two near the completion of their jobs on Earth, Harper begins having visions of his life prior to the mandatory memory-wipe that is required for service-workers. These visions lead him on a chain of events that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his life.Director Joseph Kosinski creates a vividly rich and nuanced futuristic environment where much of the technology feels like what truly is on the horizon. Kosinski directed 2010's under-rated visual spectacle, Tron Legacy, and it is apparent that he has his finger on the pulse of crisp, sci-fi style. Narrative-wise, Oblivion is a much more complex story than is likely expected. The complexities do provide some depth to the film and force the audience to pay close attention; however, the juxtaposition between the style and the narrative is not smooth. Occasionally, the film is forced into a lull as it tries to tie up its intricate plot points without sacrificing its visual pageantry. This is most apparent in the scenes that develop the sub-plot involving a human resistance leader named Beech (Morgan Freeman) and a mysterious NASA survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko).Oblivion's chief attributes are clearly its visual elements. Freeman and Kurylenko's characters are thinly developed and the actors are mostly unremarkable. However, it is becoming more and more apparent that any film that features Morgan Freeman in any role is most likely not a bad movie. Thematically, the film is successful at developing some intriguing ideas about discovery and purpose. The film acts as a subtle homage to familiar films like Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even Wall-E. Speaking of familiar, the score is oddly reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films. This is simply an observation, but having Morgan Freeman in the film as well certainly makes one wonder if this is some form of statement. Regardless, while some will no doubt be puzzled or dissatisfied with the conclusion, Oblivion mostly works as an epic and visually alluring entry into the science-fiction canon. B+On a side note, seeing the film in IMAX or an XTREME screen is recommended as the film has so much to offer visually.

While I personally like the greens and the blue hues of our planet the stark black and white and brown contrasts of the post-apocalyptic &#34;Oblivion&#34; starring Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, and a fetching Olga Kurylenko are almost attractively fetishistic in their composition.  I suppose that the heightened tension of all those killer drones that buzz about to kill humans (timely social commentary? or sci-fi coincidence?) exacerbate how the visuals will burn themselves into the viewer's memory.The story of a clone (whoops! spoiler) who doesn't know what he is and learns that he's doing exactly the opposite of what he thought that he was supposed to be doing is carried out well.  That Cruise's Jack Harper character becomes conflicted due to recurring images/ memories of another life is a trope that is put to good effect.  The quiet and building dissolution of his relationship with his partner/ lover/ wife (?) Victoria (a sympathetic in spite of being cold Andrea Riseborough) as he comes into closer contact with his former wife Julia (Olga Kurylenko) plays out in subtle dramatic fashion and surprisingly makes this cold post-apocalypse feel warmer.  Freeman's (always a solid choice to get him into your movie) freedom fighter Beech is really only there to act as the cipher to Cruise's Harper who holds the key to someone's oblivion.A solid sci-fi actioner.

1558969,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFUO36,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","When Tron 2 Screenwriter, Joseph Kosinski, started shopping for a Publisher for his graphic novel, Oblivion, they told him it was so good that he should bring it right to the big screen. Before you know it, some big names signed out and the film was released as a big budget blockbuster. There are a ton of cool gadgets in a story about a futuristic world, that has been destroyed by war. What initially turned me on to this film was the trailer, which show you the technology, but tell you almost nothing about the story. The films description is the same way, it tells you very little and really gets your curiosity going. The story starts by telling us what has become of the world, 65 years in the future. The planet has been destroyed by war and the humans have left the planet for one of Saturn's moons. All that's left is a bunch of technology meant to harvest Earth's resources for the people on Titan. The remaining rebels mean to sabotage this technology and it's the job of Jack and Vicka to repair and protect the technology from the last remaining terrorists. Tom Cruise stars and by now we all know how I feel about Tom Cruise. Fortunatly for Mr. Kosinski, this was a film that Cruise was really into and he does give one of his strongest performance since Minority Report. Cruise is terrific and is the main reason this film works in the beginning. With the extensive back story, it takes a while for anything substantive to happen and that's where Cruise and the unique technology come into play. They carry the film from the shocking beginning into the heart of the story. Once this film gets going it is one of the best pure Science Fiction films to come along in years. To his credit, even though the film is weird and starts out slow, Kosinski wouldn't let Hollywood touch it. The result is an old school type of Science Fiction film, done with modern technology. The geeks will love this movie, but there is also enough of a side stories and some amazing special effects that will help gain the majority of audiences.

If you did a side-by-side comparison of the images of the broken-up moon, it would be apparent to you that this aspect of the  movie, OBLIVION, was copied from TIME MACHINE.  Also, the Scavengers had caused earthquakes and tsunamis, as part of their invasion of earth.  Tom Cruise, and co-workers, do their job from tetrahedral space stations that hover 3,000 feet above the ground.  These hovering tetrahedrons are inspiring to look at, and resemble the floating world in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, starring Ted Danson.  The other characters working on the tetrahedral station (Tower 49) are Victoria ""Vika"" Olsen, who also is a love interest, and  a supervisor, named, ""Sally.""  ""Sally,"" is seen only on a television screen.  Sally has an anonymous persona.  She utters ominous platitudes, such as, ""Are you working together as an effective team?""  Sally's character is like that of BIG BROTHER in the story, 1984.  Sally's image on the television screen is distorted by static.  This effect was copied from the original STAR WARS movies, where the hologram of Princes Leah was intentionally distorted by electronic static.  In this way, OBLIVION is derivative of STAR WARS.When Tom Cruise encounters the Scavengers during the course of his routine hunting expeditions to kill the Scavengers, what is disclosed is that the Scavengers have voice-altering devices that cause their voices to have a non-human timbre.  This effect was also copied from STAR WARS.  During Tom Cruise's many trips to the surface of Earth, he frequently encountered half-buried, or substantially buried, artifacts from New York City.  These include buried versions of STATUE OF LIBERTY, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  This was copied from the film, PLANET OF THE APES, written by Rod Serling.  In PLANET OF THE APES, we see a partially buried version of STATUE OF LIBERTY.The first 60 minutes of OBLIVION is extremely tedious.  Tom Cruise makes repeated trips to the bleak surface of Earth, hunting for Scavengers.  On occasion, he finds them.  Sometimes, they are elusive.  Tom Cruise repeatedly flies through canyons, an effect copied from the early STAR WARS movies.  Please recall the fight scenes where space vehicles speed through a canyon on the DEATH STAR.  This kind of scene is repeatedly shown on OBLIVION.  Apparently, the director, screenwriter, and producer of OBLIVION thought that Americans are too stupid to recognize all of the features from PLANET OF THE APES, TIME MACHINE (with Guy Pierce), and STAR WARS, that had been re-cycled to make OBLIVION.  Because of this, and because of the extreme tedium that is produced during the first hour of this film, I give the rating of two stars.  Eventually, it becomes apparent that OBLIVION does, in fact, contain some very clever features in its storyline, e.g., erasing memories and making replacement clones of various characters.  But these clever features cannot overcome the disappointment caused by the tedium of the first 60 minutes, and the disappointment caused by the extremely derivative nature of OBLIVION, that is, its being derivative from other sci-fi movies.I am sorry, Mr. Cruise, I truly loved your performance in WAR OF THE WORLDS.  And I loved your rapport with Dakota Fanning in that particular film.  The storyline, the character development, and the special effects, of WAR OF THE WORLDS makes that particular film one of my all-time-favorites.  However, I am sorry to report that, relatively speaking, OBVLIVION is a dud.",2,Surprisingly tedious.

1558988,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008JFUO36,Turfseer,"[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0In the U.S., 'Oblivion' grossed approximately $89 million. Overseas it was close to $197 million. What does this tell us? For all those non-English speaking people, the Oblivion narrative perhaps wasn't all that important--special effects and one action scene after another, were the key to the overseas success. Here perhaps word got out that this Tom Cruise vehicle was not as gripping in terms of narrative, as the Oblivion marketing people, led us to believe. There were possible reasons for this, mainly having to do with the nature of the story itself.As I found this sci-fi, action adventure film to be mediocre at best, I have no trepidations about giving away the main twist that the main plot rests its head on. So if you haven't seen the film, I strongly suggest you quit reading here and read some of the more critical reviews found at Metacritic, which don't give away the whole kit and caboodle.We're led to believe that Tom Cruises' 'Jack Harper', is a drone repairman in charge of servicing various sphere-shaped drones that emanate from a tetrahedral space station dubbed 'Tet', run by the 'good 'guys'--the surviving humans, represented by the mission commander, 'Sally', who it turns out is a computer generated entity, similar to the 'HAL' of 'A Space Odyssey'. Harper has been told that the drones service and protect fusion power generators on earth that are supposedly extracting the necessary energy for a plan to have the rest of humanity migrate to the Saturn moon, Titan. All this after an apocalypse on earth, caused by alien 'Scavengers'. Harper believes that humans defeated the 'Scavs' after they destroyed the moon, decimating earth due to the resulting gravitational shifts. Remnants of the Scavengers still remain on earth, attempting to destroy the drones which must keep the power generators operating.Before the break into the second act of the story, 'Oblivion' operates as a typical sci-fi action adventure flick. Harper's significant other, Victoria (aka Vika), has dramatically little to do, operating the computer console and assisting Harper keep track of the drones back at their house 'in the clouds'. At a certain point, Harper gets involved in a chase with the drones very reminiscent of the chase inside the death star in Star Wars. Finally, things get mildly interesting when Harper saves Julia, a human astronaut in stasis from before the apocalypse on earth. Harper has vague memories of Julia, despite having his memory 'wiped' by his overseers.When Harper discovers that he's a clone, he finally figures out that the 'Scavs' are actually the good guys as they are not aliens but humans who are battling the true aliens, represented by 'Sally' up in the 'mother ship'. So the second half has Harper joining forces with the Scavs, in their effort to destroy the aliens. It turns out that right before the alien invasion, there was a mission to Titan with the original Harper and Vika as the astronauts at the controls. Those two turn back to engage the aliens but before doing so, jettison the rest of the crew (including Julia), who turns out to be Jack's wife before the apocalypse. Harper and Vika are the prototypes used by the aliens to create the clones.'Oblivion' asks us to applaud the twists and turns in the plot, particularly the revelation that Harper is a clone and the Scavs are actually human. But it's not enough to make this compelling drama. The problem is that Cruise is not pitted against a well drawn out antagonist throughout the narrative. Before the 'big twist', Cruise as Harper battles the faceless 'Scavs', who look like rejects from the first Star Wars series. Even after it's revealed that Sally and her minions, are the true villains, Harper spends most of his time battling the antagonists' surrogates: the drones who are constantly trying to annihilate him. This is also true of the first half of Act II--it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script. 'Oblivion' really is reduced to a standard sci-fi actioner for most of the time.'Oblivion' also feels like an amalgam of many sci-fi predecessors. We've already alluded to 'Star Wars' but one is also reminded of 'Planet of the Apes', in its scenes of a ruined New York City after the apocalypse (here it's the shell of the Empire State Building which triggers Harper's memories of meeting Julia for the first time)--of course in 'Planet', it's the 'Statue Liberty' that gets the end of the world treatment.Both 'Oblivion' and 'I, Robot' have similar antagonists--a female voice which represents an entire computer network. Both 'Sally' and 'VIKKI', serve similar functions and both Will Smith and Tom Cruise must destroy the network in order to save the day. 'I, Robot', however, is much more compelling since Will Smith's character has a complex ally to play off of ('Sonny' the robot). Not so for Cruise, whose strongest ally is Julia (who is hardly what you would call a foil at all).'Oblivion' just rates an average 2.5 out of 5.0 in my book. It's got some nice special effects and that one big aforementioned twist. But in the end, 'Oblivion' is nothing more than a glorified 'shoot em up', with Cruise playing his usual 'good guy' part. I certainly wouldn't discourage the first time viewer from watching it but it's not something I would want to take a peek at, on a second go-round at all.",2,Big plot twist is not enough to save this

I enjoyed the references to past sci fi flics.  Anyone that thinks the scenes are a ""rip off"" doesn't understand homage. They were about respect of the genre and fun to spy for those who know the references. The overall story may feel like it has holes but this film is very good because it is one to reflect upon.  In doing so, you can figure out why things were the way they were and that the holes were not as much as your initially thought.  The pacing of the film was good too- not overloaded with action like big budget bozo films, and not too hung up on slow story/character development.

1558996,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B008JFUO36,V. Berk,"[1, 2]","*Thoughts on Blu-Ray at the bottom*Oblivion is a fun, if not particularly great sci-fi action film starring Tom Cruise from writer/director Joseph Kosinski.  A wonderful treat for the eyes, Oblivion manages to create a fun, visual spectacular sci-fi action flick, even if its story leaves something to be desired.The opening narration of the film establishes that Earth has been attacked by an alien force.  Most of the population has evacuated Earth to create a colony on Titan.  Earth meanwhile is being terra formed to make conditions suitable for human life.  The orbital space station ""Tet"" oversees this process.  On the surface a cleanup crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) handle drone repair and fend off the alien Scavengers (""Scavs"" for short) who threaten the drones and power stations on the planet's surface.  They receive orders from Sally (Melissa Leo) aboard Tet, and is their sole human contact.Jack is curious of his surroundings, and in his final two weeks of duty a series of events take place that cause him to question his mission.  After capsules containing human bodies fall from the sky and are destroyed by the drones he's been watching over he is thrust into a life or death struggle to discover to real fate of the planet, and its human population.Oblivion reminded me an awful lot of the kind sci-fi movies made during the 1970s.  The movie has numerous twists and I'd say at a certain point you're either going to throw your hands up in frustration or simply accept that this is the kind of movie you're watching.  Oblivion feels right at home next to movies such as The Omega Man, Soylent Green, and Logan's Run, and if you go in expecting that kind of story you shouldn't be too disappointed.Tom Cruise isn't breaking any new ground with his performance in Oblivion.  He's as good as he's ever been in the hero's role, but still, given the nature of the script there were a lot of directions they could have gone with this character.  Cruise gives the best performance in the film, but that isn't saying too much.  If they'd added some more internal conflict to the Jack Harper character I'm sure Cruise could have pulled it off and the movie would have been better for it.  As it is, this is you're pretty typical protagonist role for Tom Cruise.It is the visuals and action sequences of Oblivion that really sell the picture.  As with his previous outing in TRON: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski proves he has an eye for striking sci-fi visuals and spectacular action.  When the story isn't breaking any new ground the visuals will keep you interested, if nothing else.  It just works.  Oblivion has some outstanding aerial battles involving Jack's ""Bubble Ship"" which really is a blast to watch.  From a design standpoint I  think the bubble ship Jack flies around is one of the coolest I've seen on film, looking like a cross between a helicopter and a dragonfly.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bubble ship winds up being the thing people remember most about this movie.As it is Oblivion, is an enjoyable sci-fi action movie.  If you're at all a fan of those old sci-fi movies where plot twists lie around every corner, exciting action sequences, and exciting sci-fi visuals odds are you'll enjoy Oblivion.Blu-Ray:The Blu-Ray release of Oblivion has great picture and sound.  Special features include a decent look into the making of the film.  What I valued most about the special features was the knowledge that many of Oblivion's effects were done in-camera.  In an age where CGI dominates almost every aspect of film this is refreshing, and further aids Kosinski in making Oblivion a tribute to 70s sci-fi.Also included are deleted scenes and a feature commentary by director Kosinski and Cruise, and an isolated soundtrack score.Oblivion release will make great use of your Blu-Ray player, HDTV, and sound system.  I wish there'd been more material discussing the world of Oblivion, but it is a satisfying purchase. So, I'm going to give a thumbs up to Oblivion on Blu-Ray.",4,Visually spectacular sci-fi thriller,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,4045,"['*Thoughts', 'Blu-Ray', 'bottom*Oblivion', 'fun', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'writer/director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'eyes', 'Oblivion', 'create', 'fun', 'visual', 'spectacular', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'flick', 'even', 'story', 'something', 'be', 'desired.The', 'opening', 'narration', 'film', 'Earth', 'been', 'attacked', 'alien', 'force', 'Most', 'population', 'evacuated', 'Earth', 'create', 'colony', 'Titan', 'Earth', 'meanwhile', 'being', 'terra', 'formed', 'make', 'conditions', 'suitable', 'human', 'life', 'orbital', 'space', 'station', 'Tet', 'process', 'surface', 'cleanup', 'crew', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Victoria', 'Olsen', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'handle', 'drone', 'repair', 'fend', 'off', 'alien', 'Scavengers', 'Scavs', 'short', 'who', 'threaten', 'drones', 'power', 'stations', 'planet', 'surface', 'receive', 'orders', 'Sally', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'aboard', 'Tet', 'sole', 'human', 'contact.Jack', 'curious', 'surroundings', 'final', 'two', 'weeks', 'duty', 'series', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'question', 'mission', 'capsules', 'containing', 'human', 'bodies', 'fall', 'sky', 'are', 'destroyed', 'drones', 'been', 'watching', 'thrust', 'life', 'death', 'struggle', 'discover', 'real', 'fate', 'planet', 'human', 'population.Oblivion', 'reminded', 'awful', 'lot', 'kind', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'made', '1970s', 'movie', 'numerous', 'twists', ""'d"", 'say', 'certain', 'point', ""'re"", 'going', 'throw', 'hands', 'up', 'frustration', 'simply', 'accept', 'kind', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Oblivion', 'feels', 'right', 'home', 'movies', 'such', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'Logan', 'Run', 'go', 'expecting', 'kind', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed.Tom', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'performance', 'Oblivion', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'been', 'hero', 'role', 'still', 'given', 'nature', 'script', 'were', 'lot', 'directions', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'character', 'Cruise', 'best', 'performance', 'film', ""n't"", 'saying', 'too', 'much', ""'d"", 'added', 'more', 'internal', 'conflict', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'character', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Cruise', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'typical', 'protagonist', 'role', 'Tom', 'Cruise.It', 'visuals', 'action', 'sequences', 'Oblivion', 'really', 'sell', 'picture', 'previous', 'outing', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'eye', 'striking', 'sci-fi', 'visuals', 'spectacular', 'action', 'When', 'story', ""n't"", 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'visuals', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'nothing', 'else', 'just', 'Oblivion', 'outstanding', 'aerial', 'battles', 'involving', 'Jack', 'Bubble', 'Ship', 'really', 'blast', 'watch', 'design', 'standpoint', 'think', 'bubble', 'ship', 'Jack', 'around', 'one', 'coolest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'looking', 'cross', 'helicopter', 'dragonfly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'bubble', 'ship', 'up', 'being', 'thing', 'people', 'remember', 'most', 'movie.As', 'Oblivion', 'enjoyable', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'where', 'plot', 'lie', 'corner', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'exciting', 'sci-fi', 'visuals', 'odds', 'are', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Oblivion.Blu-Ray', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Oblivion', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'decent', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'What', 'valued', 'most', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'knowledge', 'many', 'Oblivion', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'in-camera', 'age', 'where', 'CGI', 'almost', 'aspect', 'film', 'refreshing', 'further', 'aids', 'Kosinski', 'making', 'Oblivion', 'tribute', '70s', 'sci-fi.Also', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Kosinski', 'Cruise', 'isolated', 'soundtrack', 'score.Oblivion', 'release', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'use', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'HDTV', 'sound', 'system', 'wish', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'material', 'discussing', 'world', 'Oblivion', 'satisfying', 'purchase', 'So', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Oblivion', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

By the end of my first viewing, however, I was completely stumped.  What was I not understanding?  So...I watched it again.  I even enjoyed it more the second time than the first but wham! Got to the end and was again completely baffled.  I guess I'll have to consult someone much smarter than I (not hard) to help me understand what in the world is going on because Oblivion isn't providing any obvious clues.  Why the unnecessary complications?  The rest of the movie was enjoyable to watch but was also fairly standard sci-fi stuff when it comes right down to it.  I doubt that I ever want to watch it again simply because of it's confusing nature.  I have to ask: Why mess with the audience that way?  Why not write a script that clearly explains what's going on?  Too much is simply left dangling which ultimately destroys the entire movie except for the fact that the graphics and other aspects of the movie are quite stunning and interesting.I was somewhat loathe to give Oblivion 3 stars; it really deserves a weak 2.5 stars.  Oh yes, just as a side note, one other aspect of this movie that I just couldn't understand:  Victoria/Vika's eyes were so dilated throughout most of the movie that it was as if she was on LSD or something.  Actually, when she first appears, I thought she was meant to be some kind of android or something.  Her behavior was also very unhumanlike; more robotic than human.  And the very obvious fake eyelashes of hers in the year 2077?  I mean, here they can clone humans and develop all these high tech gadgets and weapons, but can't come up with a more realistic looking fake eyelash?  And again, what's with those eyes of hers?  In addition, anyone who's ever had their pupils dilated that much knows how sensitive to light your eyes become, often forcing the person to wear sunglasses.  Again, there is never any reason or explanation made apparent for this.In the end, there are just way too many plot holes and logical inconsistencies to truly ""sell"" this movie to me.  I was on board for the better part of the movie until the end.

1559009,ARWCFLO1Q0XY9,B008JFUO36,W. Foley,"[4, 5]","I picked up the latest Science-Fiction epic Oblivion. Sometimes I get a little worried buying  a movie sight unseen but this time it certainly did not disappoint! The movie stars Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman and was directed by Joseph Kosinski and based on his graphic novel of the same name. The movie is one of the apocalyptic films which displays the planet earth after it has been destroyed by aliens.I have decided this will be a spoiler free review because I think this is a movie you really need to see for yourself and to see it unfold before you. I will give a basic synopsis of the plot. It is the year 2077, 60 years after earth was invaded by aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria ""Vika"" Owen, played by the beautiful Andrea Riseborough, are the only ones on  after the invasion and they are there to repair drones that are fighting off the residual alien resistance. The surviving inhabitants of earth are living on Titan one of the moons of Saturn. Harper meets up with Malcolm Beech a resistance fighter played by the legendary Morgan Freeman (one of my very favorite actors) and he also begins to have flash backs to a time he was with a woman on the Empire State Building prior to the alien invasion. Things begin to unravel and we begin to see that appearances can be deceptive.Pros: The cinematography and special effects are stellar. This movie is great eye candy but you do not get an overdose of it. The acting is great and two of my favorites, Cruise and Freeman, are in this film and do a fine job. This is my first time seeing Andrea Riseborough and I enjoyed her performance. She portrays a sense of vulnerability while also wanting to stay in denial concerning the things Jack is discovering. I do like the story. Some of the criticisms I have read that there are plot elements that we have seen in other movies. While I can agree with that assessment, I can also see that this is common in Hollywood movies. I am fine with movies that may have similar plot elements to other movies as long as it is executed well and that is the case with this movie. I also enjoy the story. The movie mixes romance, mystery and action adventure into a tale that will keep the viewer engaged and caring about all the characters throughout. Despite great special effects this is a very character driven movie.Cons: I really have only one minor complaint. Director Kosinski wanted this movie to be an homage to the science fiction films of the 70s and in many way he succeeds in that endeavor. The movie is paced more like a film from the 70s and it is slower than the more kinetic pacing we modern viewers and grown accustomed to. Is that a fault of the directors or is it a fault of the viewer? I will place blame on myself. We live in a fast paced mircowave society that wants instant gratification. So it was hard to slow down and get absorbed into the story. I just wasn't used to it. So really this is not a con, it is just something that the viewer needs to be aware of when going in to the movie. It is an old-fashioned movie and as I think more on the pacing, it really does work even though some viewers might not be used to it.This movie does have some good re watch capabilities for me. As a mystery there are clues throughout the movie and on more than one viewing you can pick up on these clues. In an era where science fiction films are heavy with CGI and are like cotton candy for the mind, this one is not. It will make you think and keep you on your toes.",5,An old-fashioned Science-Fiction Epic!,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,3503,"['picked', 'up', 'latest', 'Science-Fiction', 'epic', 'Oblivion', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'little', 'worried', 'buying', 'movie', 'sight', 'unseen', 'time', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'directed', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'one', 'apocalyptic', 'films', 'displays', 'planet', 'earth', 'been', 'destroyed', 'aliens.I', 'have', 'decided', 'will', 'be', 'spoiler', 'free', 'review', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'see', 'unfold', 'will', 'give', 'basic', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'year', '2077', '60', 'years', 'earth', 'was', 'invaded', 'aliens', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'partner', 'Victoria', 'Vika', 'Owen', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'invasion', 'are', 'there', 'repair', 'drones', 'are', 'fighting', 'off', 'residual', 'alien', 'resistance', 'surviving', 'inhabitants', 'earth', 'are', 'living', 'Titan', 'one', 'moons', 'Saturn', 'Harper', 'up', 'Malcolm', 'Beech', 'resistance', 'fighter', 'played', 'legendary', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'actors', 'also', 'have', 'flash', 'backs', 'time', 'was', 'woman', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'prior', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Things', 'begin', 'unravel', 'begin', 'see', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceptive.Pros', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'stellar', 'movie', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'overdose', 'acting', 'great', 'two', 'favorites', 'Cruise', 'Freeman', 'are', 'film', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'sense', 'vulnerability', 'also', 'wanting', 'stay', 'denial', 'concerning', 'things', 'Jack', 'discovering', 'do', 'story', 'criticisms', 'have', 'read', 'are', 'plot', 'elements', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'agree', 'assessment', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'common', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'am', 'fine', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'similar', 'plot', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'as', 'long', 'executed', 'well', 'case', 'movie', 'also', 'enjoy', 'story', 'movie', 'mixes', 'romance', 'mystery', 'action', 'adventure', 'tale', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'caring', 'characters', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'character', 'driven', 'movie.Cons', 'really', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'minor', 'complaint', 'Director', 'Kosinski', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'homage', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', '70s', 'many', 'way', 'endeavor', 'movie', 'paced', 'more', 'film', '70s', 'slower', 'more', 'kinetic', 'pacing', 'modern', 'viewers', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'fault', 'directors', 'fault', 'viewer', 'will', 'place', 'blame', 'live', 'fast', 'paced', 'mircowave', 'society', 'instant', 'gratification', 'was', 'hard', 'slow', 'down', 'get', 'absorbed', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'So', 'really', 'not', 'con', 'just', 'something', 'viewer', 'be', 'aware', 'when', 'going', 'movie', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'pacing', 'really', 'work', 'even', 'viewers', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'it.This', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 're', 'watch', 'capabilities', 'mystery', 'are', 'clues', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'clues', 'era', 'where', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'are', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'are', 'cotton', 'candy', 'mind', 'one', 'not', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'keep', 'toes']",N/A

Though i haven't yet developed in my head what that particular standard should be.There are some twists and turns.  bigger minds than mine saw them coming a mile away I'm sure.  But i turn off that part of my brain in watching a movie.  I think it's pointless and goes against the fun and concept of paying money to watch a movie.  I don't pay $5 to brave my way through a haunted house and not be scared and i don't pay $7 for a matinee to figure out whats going to happen before it does.I liked all the actors in the movies.  Olga and that British actress were enjoyable.  Morgan Freeman is his usual top notch self.  And the grand finale was rather similar to all the other movie endings.  This was an apocalyptic tale just like most of the other movies being cranked out.  It's whats playing at the theater anymore.  Some i love, some I endure and others I mock (see After Earth.)  This I loved.

1559036,AP3B615GM191G,B008JFUO36,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 4]","Generally speaking, my favorite films are the ones that are pretty much genre-diverse.  Yet, if I do break down into genres, my favorite is science fiction.  That is the reason for the five-star ranking of ""Oblivion"", as it is simply the purest form of sci-fi put to film.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees the team of Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) monitoring the water-removal from Earth after the planet has been decimated by attack (""we used the nukes"", says Jack in an opening montage).  On one ""away mission"", however, Jack is blind-side by Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of a gang of rogues that changes everything that Jack has ever believed in (or thought he believed in).Plot-wise, this is science fiction at its finest.  It is part other-worldly, part cautionary tale, part human drama, and all adventure throughout.  For those who have watched a lot of sci-fi, all the basic ""landmarks"" of such stories are touched upon.  It doesn't get old or feel re-hashed, though, as director Joseph Kosinski makes sure to keep the proceedings on track and moving forward.The visuals of ""Oblivion"" are also spectacular.  You'll feel as if you truly are in the future via the use of interesting, integrated new technologies.  This isn't one of those ""all visuals"" movies, by no means, but it would be more accurate to say that the visuals perfectly complement the storylines and characters.Overall, sci-fi fans will love ""Oblivion"" for its ability to make the mind wonder.  It might not be the flick for everyone, but if it looks even at all intriguing to you it's a pretty good bet you'll at least find it somewhat enjoyable (if not much more so).",5,Science Fiction In Its Purest Form,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1678,"['Generally', 'speaking', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'genre-diverse', 'do', 'break', 'down', 'genres', 'favorite', 'science', 'fiction', 'reason', 'five-star', 'ranking', 'Oblivion', 'simply', 'purest', 'form', 'sci-fi', 'put', 'film.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'team', 'Jack', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Victoria', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'monitoring', 'water-removal', 'Earth', 'planet', 'been', 'decimated', 'attack', 'used', 'nukes', 'Jack', 'opening', 'montage', 'one', 'away', 'mission', 'however', 'Jack', 'blind-side', 'Beech', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'leader', 'gang', 'rogues', 'changes', 'everything', 'Jack', 'ever', 'believed', 'thought', 'believed', '.Plot-wise', 'science', 'fiction', 'finest', 'part', 'other-worldly', 'part', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'part', 'human', 'drama', 'adventure', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'lot', 'sci-fi', 'basic', 'landmarks', 'such', 'stories', 'are', 'touched', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'feel', 're-hashed', 'though', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'sure', 'keep', 'proceedings', 'track', 'moving', 'forward.The', 'visuals', 'Oblivion', 'are', 'also', 'spectacular', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'truly', 'are', 'future', 'use', 'interesting', 'integrated', 'new', 'technologies', ""n't"", 'one', 'visuals', 'movies', 'means', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'visuals', 'perfectly', 'complement', 'storylines', 'characters.Overall', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'Oblivion', 'ability', 'make', 'mind', 'wonder', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'flick', 'everyone', 'even', 'intriguing', 'pretty', 'good', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'least', 'find', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'so']",N/A

I bought the Blu-ray and was expecting a strictly action/sci-fi movie with a lot of cool visuals and not a lot of plot.  I was right about the action and visuals, they are great in Oblivion.  However, the plot is what really surprised me.It went from being a good action movie to a GREAT ""thinking"" movie.  Kinda like Inception or a similar movie where it really makes you stop and say, wait a minute, what's going on here...I love movies that have an interesting and dynamic deep storyline, and Oblivion ends up having that. Personally, for my movie taste, I loved it, and it is definitely a movie that you will get more out of by watching it more than once.
