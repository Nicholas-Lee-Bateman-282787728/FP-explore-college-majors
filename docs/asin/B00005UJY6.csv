Indeed, this movie moved so slow I think it took just short of an eternity to watch it!  My wife, literally, longed for it to come to the end.  We both found the conversations to be mostly overly verbose and insignificant to moving the story along.  There isn't anything in it that would be against traditional family values.  The reason we watched it is because the daughter was eighteen years old, and I'm working on a book on movies about kids.  I'd say the best that could be said of this movie is that it does give the feeling of being the 'third wheel' or the 'odd woman out.'  This is supposed to be the first in a series of four seasons; if so, it is going to be a very, very long year.",1,It Looks Like It Is Going to Be a VERY Long Year,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,784,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'moved', 'so', 'slow', 'think', 'took', 'just', 'short', 'eternity', 'watch', 'My', 'wife', 'literally', 'longed', 'come', 'end', 'found', 'conversations', 'be', 'mostly', 'overly', 'verbose', 'insignificant', 'moving', 'story', 'along', ""n't"", 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'reason', 'watched', 'daughter', 'was', 'eighteen', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", 'working', 'book', 'movies', 'kids', ""'d"", 'say', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'give', 'feeling', 'being', ""'third"", 'wheel', ""'odd"", 'woman', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'year']",N/A
684235,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B00005UJY6,Doctor Trance,"[19, 20]","Let me start by saying that if you don't like French films where there is no action and it's mostly just dialogue amongst the leads in a few different indoor/outdoor settings, then don't look here. However, if you find Eric Rohmer films, and French films that are very ""talky"" engaging, then this is one of the better ones.The leads in this films all give wonderful performances and while I don't like every Rohmer film, I liked this one a lot. Even though it is all talking throughout, the conversations and script kept me intrigued and I found the movie flew buy in a good way (normally talky pictures seem to drag on and on).The plot is basically a beautiful 18-year-old French girl (the redhead on the DVD cover) meets a late 20's/early 30's girl at a party where they are both bored and become friends. The 18-year-old despises her late 30's/early 40's father's girlfriend and believes that if she puts her new friend togther with her dad, he will fall for her and forget his fiancee. That's basically it, but the characters keep you focused and quite interested in their simple interactions.The settings are plain, but rather nice-looking French decor. Even though it's a late 80's film, I didn't see much in it to make you think you were in that time frame. A film that looks very fresh today. Also, the MGM-World Films line does a much better job of the transfer than the rest of Rohmer's films, which are done by the folks at Fox/Lorber. The picture quality is far superior and you can change and remove the subtitles (unlike the Lorber films which are burned in).",4,A wonderfully entertaining French flick!,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,1573,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'French', 'films', 'where', 'action', 'mostly', 'just', 'dialogue', 'amongst', 'leads', 'few', 'different', 'indoor/outdoor', 'settings', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'here', 'However', 'find', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'French', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'talky', 'engaging', 'then', 'one', 'better', 'ones.The', 'leads', 'films', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rohmer', 'film', 'liked', 'one', 'lot', 'Even', 'talking', 'conversations', 'script', 'kept', 'intrigued', 'found', 'movie', 'flew', 'buy', 'good', 'way', 'normally', 'talky', 'pictures', 'seem', 'drag', '.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'beautiful', '18-year-old', 'French', 'girl', 'redhead', 'DVD', 'cover', 'late', ""20's/early"", '30', 'girl', 'party', 'where', 'are', 'bored', 'become', 'friends', '18-year-old', 'late', ""30's/early"", '40', 'father', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'friend', 'togther', 'dad', 'will', 'fall', 'forget', 'fiancee', 'basically', 'characters', 'keep', 'focused', 'quite', 'interested', 'simple', 'interactions.The', 'settings', 'are', 'plain', 'rather', 'nice-looking', 'French', 'decor', 'Even', 'late', '80', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'make', 'think', 'were', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'very', 'fresh', 'today', 'Also', 'MGM-World', 'Films', 'line', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'transfer', 'rest', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'are', 'done', 'folks', 'Fox/Lorber', 'picture', 'quality', 'far', 'superior', 'can', 'change', 'remove', 'subtitles', 'Lorber', 'films', 'are', 'burned']",N/A

Now, I don't say ""mundane"" in a bad way. The subjects of these films are things that could happen to me, you or anyone we know. They are infinitely easier to relate to your own real world conflicts and experiences. There are no easy resolutions.There are misunderstandings, hard feelings and none of it is terribly exciting, but it is important to you at the time. These films are a great snapshot of real life - or as real as you can get in a film. The characters are appealing, charming and real. There's no omniscient narrator providing insight into their thoughts -- so it is a bit more work.Since I had not read the synopsis in a while, I kept thinking ""OK, is this going to be a crush between Natacha & Jeanne"" or maybe the antagonism between Natacha and her dad's girlfriend was due to an attraction or history between the two (ie, they dated or had a fling?).I guess 24 films at Frameline in the course of a week will change your perspective on ambitions and motivations of characters in other, perfectly straight, films. It was charming - I can't say I would highly recommend it to the general public, but if you like Rohmer or this type of French ""comedy"" - you may enjoy this film.",3,Interesting French Psychological Drama,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1417,"['Rohmer', 'Boyfriends', 'Girlfriends', 'what', 'lot', 'folks', 'who', 'claim', 'dislike', 'foreign', 'films', 'really', 'dislike', 'lots', 'talk', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'subjects', 'are', 'really', 'mundane', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'mundane', 'bad', 'way', 'subjects', 'films', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'know', 'are', 'infinitely', 'easier', 'relate', 'own', 'real', 'world', 'conflicts', 'experiences', 'are', 'easy', 'are', 'misunderstandings', 'hard', 'feelings', 'none', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'important', 'time', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'snapshot', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'real', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'appealing', 'charming', 'real', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'providing', 'insight', 'thoughts', 'bit', 'more', 'work.Since', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'synopsis', 'while', 'kept', 'thinking', 'OK', 'going', 'be', 'crush', 'Natacha', 'Jeanne', 'maybe', 'antagonism', 'Natacha', 'dad', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'due', 'attraction', 'history', 'two', 'ie', 'dated', 'had', 'fling', '.I', 'guess', '24', 'films', 'Frameline', 'course', 'week', 'will', 'change', 'perspective', 'ambitions', 'motivations', 'characters', 'other', 'perfectly', 'straight', 'films', 'was', 'charming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'general', 'public', 'like', 'Rohmer', 'type', 'French', 'comedy', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A
684237,A2EXDP1BBSAFQ6,B00005UJY6,Matthew Watters,"[2, 2]","While Rohmer's four ""seasonal"" films are eclipsed by the monumental Autumn's Tale -- which rivals Claire's Knee as the finest film Rohmer ever made -- this first entry in the Tales of Four Seasons is a worthy effort. All four films in the cycle involve a matchmaking theme (although in Winter's Tale, the matchmaker may, egad!, be God), and the cleverness of A Tale of Springtime is how the overly analytical high school philosophy teacher jumps to the conclusion that she is the object of a matchmaking scheme when, indeed, it may be all in her mind, the over-workings of an over-active imagination. While the casting in this film is a bit bland, Rohmer is attentive to details in his usual way:  the film opens with the teacher leaving for spring break from Lycee Jacques Brel (how funny is that?) and deciding to head for Paris after viewing the empty disarray of her absent boyfriend's flat. Characters are constantly defined by their habitats and cares, whether flowers on a balcony or an art critic's well-stocked bookcase. Walled-in spaces define the limits of feeling, and what passes for a plot here is so internalised that Rohmer adds a McGuffin, a little mystery over a lost necklace, to give this delicate souffle a bit of structure. It's a masterwork if not a masterpiece by one of the greatest writer-directors in world cinema.",4,A match made .... all in your mind,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1341,"['Rohmer', 'four', 'seasonal', 'films', 'are', 'eclipsed', 'monumental', 'Autumn', 'Tale', 'rivals', 'Claire', 'Knee', 'finest', 'film', 'Rohmer', 'ever', 'made', 'first', 'entry', 'Tales', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'worthy', 'effort', 'four', 'films', 'cycle', 'involve', 'matchmaking', 'theme', 'Winter', 'Tale', 'matchmaker', 'may', 'egad', 'be', 'God', 'cleverness', 'A', 'Tale', 'Springtime', 'how', 'overly', 'analytical', 'high', 'school', 'philosophy', 'teacher', 'jumps', 'conclusion', 'object', 'matchmaking', 'scheme', 'when', 'indeed', 'may', 'be', 'mind', 'over-workings', 'over-active', 'imagination', 'casting', 'film', 'bit', 'bland', 'Rohmer', 'attentive', 'details', 'usual', 'way', 'film', 'teacher', 'leaving', 'spring', 'break', 'Lycee', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'how', 'funny', 'deciding', 'head', 'Paris', 'viewing', 'empty', 'disarray', 'absent', 'boyfriend', 'flat', 'Characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'defined', 'habitats', 'cares', 'flowers', 'balcony', 'art', 'critic', 'well-stocked', 'bookcase', 'Walled-in', 'spaces', 'define', 'limits', 'feeling', 'what', 'plot', 'here', 'so', 'internalised', 'Rohmer', 'McGuffin', 'little', 'mystery', 'lost', 'necklace', 'give', 'delicate', 'bit', 'structure', 'masterwork', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'greatest', 'writer-directors', 'world', 'cinema']",N/A

It is an interesting film, but it is far from being excellent, at least in my opinion.The plot is not complicated. A philosophy teacher, Jeanne (Anne Teyss&egrave;dre), finds herself temporarily without a place to live, due to the fact that she has lent her apartment to a cousin, and also because she has no intention whatsoever of living in her boyfriend's house while he is on holidays. Fortunately, Jeanne meets Natacha (Florence Darel), a young woman that invites Jeanne to her home, arguing that it is a perfect solution for both, because she doesn't like to be alone. Truth to be told, Natacha shares her house with her father Igor (Hugues Quester), but he is almost never there, preferring to be with his young girlfriend, Eve (Elose Bennett).Not much happens during this film, apart from the fact that Natacha constantly tries to connect Jeanne with her father. All the same, I think you will enjoy the long conversations between the characters, and the beautiful countryside scenery. Is that enough to recommend ""A tale of springtime""?

While I don't mind the French penchant for analyzing and dissecting every small event, and I actually like it, this film pushes the envelope a bit even for me.The plot is uneventful...a young woman who teaches philosophy in high school meets a muchyounger woman at a party where neither one wants to be.  The younger one, Natasha, invites the older one, Jeanne, to stay at her father's apartment because Jeanne has lent her own apartment to a friend for the weekend.  Conversation ensues....Natasha who doesn't have much to do with her own mother, takes instantly to the kind and calm Jeanne and tells her about her personal problems, especially her father, and her father's ""evil"" girlfriend, Eve.  One thing leads to another and the whole group meets at another of Natasha's father's properties, this one in the country.  Personalities clash and collide, romances happen and almost happen.  And they all talk about it, on and on.I am fascinated by French culture, how the people interact, what they talk about, what they wear, how they decorate their homes, what they eat, etc.  As for the plot, there isn't much of one.  The conversation really wasn't that interesting or profound, either.  The cast is interesting to me. I enjoy the differences between French and American actors.  Igor, Natasha's father is supposed to be wildly attractive and Jeanne very beautiful.  Niether one would qualify in that way to most Americans, I think. But for me, that's part of the fascination I have for these films.I can't say that I really enjoyed the film.  It's not a lot of fun, the people are not that interesting or engaging, and it doesn't make me ponder the deeper questions of life.  I doubt that I will ever watch it again but I liked it enough to make me want to see some of the others in this series.
