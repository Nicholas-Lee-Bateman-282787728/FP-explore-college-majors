1186196,A2TXMYYGSZCSZ1,B001EPKKUK,"annie ""grannieannie""","[9, 10]","This  is a great movie about St. Francis and St. Clare.  It does an excellent job of portraying the lives they lived and their answer when God called them to leave their lives of wealth and follow him.  The movie is inspiring, the acting is outstanding, and I enjoyed learning more about these two great saints.  The movie is 200 minutes long but it will definitely hold your interest.  I agree with other reviewers who have said you will want to watch this more than once.In Chapter 12, ""Friends Join Francis"", the writer has done a beautiful job of showing the parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of Francis.  There is a scene where a group of men (Priests?) approach the local bishop to express their concern over Francis and his followers.  They exclaim that they feel the bishop has underestimated ""the problem"" because there are more and more of them everyday -- at least a dozen - and they go around the country saying they were ordered by God.  The bishop replies that their words remind him of a story he has read several times, the Gospel, and he asks them if they have ever read it.A 16 page booklet is included with the DVD which I found to be very useful.  It contains short biographies of Clare and Francis and lists of the important dates in their lives.  It also  includes a very informative interview with Fr. Andrew Apostolic ,C.F.R., well-known speaker and author., and a resource list.Clare and Francis is directed by Fabrizio Costa who directedMother Teresa, another great film.I recommend this movie as a great way for families to get to know more about St. Francis and St. Clare. Buy it, watch it, share it friends and family, and donate a copy to your parish library if you have one.""Take nothing for your journey"", Luke 9:3",5,Take Nothing For Your Journey,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,1760,"['great', 'movie', 'St.', 'Francis', 'St.', 'Clare', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'lives', 'lived', 'answer', 'when', 'God', 'called', 'leave', 'lives', 'wealth', 'follow', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'more', 'two', 'great', 'saints', 'movie', '200', 'minutes', 'long', 'will', 'definitely', 'hold', 'interest', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once.In', 'Chapter', '12', 'Friends', 'Join', 'Francis', 'writer', 'done', 'beautiful', 'job', 'showing', 'parallel', 'life', 'Jesus', 'life', 'Francis', 'scene', 'where', 'group', 'men', 'Priests', 'approach', 'local', 'bishop', 'express', 'concern', 'Francis', 'followers', 'exclaim', 'feel', 'bishop', 'underestimated', 'problem', 'are', 'more', 'more', 'everyday', 'least', 'dozen', 'go', 'country', 'saying', 'were', 'ordered', 'God', 'bishop', 'words', 'remind', 'story', 'read', 'several', 'times', 'Gospel', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'it.A', '16', 'page', 'booklet', 'included', 'DVD', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'short', 'biographies', 'Clare', 'Francis', 'lists', 'important', 'dates', 'lives', 'also', 'very', 'informative', 'interview', 'Fr', 'Andrew', 'Apostolic', 'C.F.R.', 'well-known', 'speaker', 'author.', 'resource', 'list.Clare', 'Francis', 'directed', 'Fabrizio', 'Costa', 'who', 'directedMother', 'Teresa', 'great', 'film.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'families', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'St.', 'Francis', 'St.', 'Clare', 'Buy', 'watch', 'share', 'family', 'donate', 'copy', 'parish', 'library', 'have', 'one', 'Take', 'nothing', 'journey', 'Luke', '9:3']",Clare and Francis

1186205,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B001EPKKUK,K. Ostrowski,"[9, 10]","I've always been something of a fan of many of the saints, and one of my favorites was Francis of Assisi; who not only accomplished a great many fantastic things in his life, by following the will of God, but received a visible stigmata, and worked numerous miracles through prayer, and faith in God.Of all the people in human history, I think that there have been maybe two dozen who've seen as many miracles as Saint Francis, yet this movie depicts only a couple of them.In some ways, this is a good thing, because it allows the story to be approached from a new perspective; the perspective of Clare herself.  The majority of the movie focuses on Clare; her hurtles and motivations in the path she chooses, and includes Francis only in instances where you need to know about him to really understand what Clare did.  It's certainly different from the usual approach, and given the approach that it takes, it does remarkably well.The story is involving, moving, and really brings out the characters of Francis and Clare, as people, struggling to do God's work in a world where their self-imposed poverty is seen as a mockery to their friends and family; to the rich and poor alike.  It's a fantastic story about faith, and a beautiful tale in more ways than one.However, there's also a problem with this type of approach; in that by focusing on the lives of Clare and Francis, and what kind of people they were, the focus is somewhat drawn away from the one person who was the true star in the life of every saint.Miracles are not neccesary in order to make a religious movie good.  I think Pope John XXIII proved that rather handily.  However, as I watch this movie, I couldn't help but wonder why the works of God in the life of Francis were being largely downplayed and ignored.The stigmata is shown in one scene, just before Francis' death, and there's a scene with a wolf, and one with the baby Jesus, but that's all.  The life of Saint Francis was full of supernatural events, communication with the lord, visions, healings, and animals who listened to him preach when no one else would.  In my mind, these things are inseparable from Francis of Assisi, and they helped to define just how special his choices were, and more to the point, how special God really was.There's a danger there, of surrendering to skepticism.  It seems the words ""superstition"" and ""supernatural"" are often confused with one another, to the point where depictions of the supernatural can be avoided, even in religious films; a mistake that Padre Pio, for example, didn't make.Still, this is a quality movie about Saint Claire, and her view of the faith of Francis.  I found it very encouraging, and very good.  If, like myself, you can find faith and good deeds inspiring, then you'll probably enjoy it too.  Just don't watch it if you're expecting to be dazzled.  There are other movies for that sort of thing.",4,I can understand why Clare gets top billing.,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,2896,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'something', 'fan', 'many', 'saints', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'accomplished', 'great', 'many', 'fantastic', 'things', 'life', 'following', 'will', 'God', 'received', 'visible', 'stigmata', 'worked', 'numerous', 'miracles', 'prayer', 'faith', 'God.Of', 'people', 'human', 'history', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'maybe', 'two', 'dozen', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'miracles', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'yet', 'movie', 'only', 'couple', 'them.In', 'ways', 'good', 'thing', 'story', 'be', 'approached', 'new', 'perspective', 'perspective', 'Clare', 'majority', 'movie', 'Clare', 'hurtles', 'motivations', 'path', 'Francis', 'only', 'instances', 'where', 'need', 'know', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'Clare', 'did', 'certainly', 'different', 'usual', 'approach', 'given', 'approach', 'remarkably', 'well.The', 'story', 'involving', 'moving', 'really', 'out', 'characters', 'Francis', 'Clare', 'people', 'struggling', 'do', 'God', 'work', 'world', 'where', 'self-imposed', 'poverty', 'seen', 'mockery', 'friends', 'family', 'rich', 'poor', 'alike', 'fantastic', 'story', 'faith', 'beautiful', 'tale', 'more', 'ways', 'one.However', 'also', 'problem', 'type', 'approach', 'focusing', 'lives', 'Clare', 'Francis', 'what', 'kind', 'people', 'were', 'focus', 'somewhat', 'drawn', 'away', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'true', 'star', 'life', 'saint.Miracles', 'are', 'not', 'neccesary', 'order', 'make', 'religious', 'movie', 'good', 'think', 'Pope', 'John', 'XXIII', 'proved', 'rather', 'handily', 'However', 'watch', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'works', 'God', 'life', 'Francis', 'were', 'being', 'largely', 'downplayed', 'ignored.The', 'stigmata', 'shown', 'one', 'scene', 'just', 'Francis', 'death', 'scene', 'wolf', 'one', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'life', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'was', 'full', 'supernatural', 'events', 'communication', 'lord', 'visions', 'healings', 'animals', 'who', 'listened', 'preach', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'mind', 'things', 'are', 'inseparable', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'helped', 'define', 'just', 'how', 'special', 'choices', 'were', 'more', 'point', 'how', 'special', 'God', 'really', 'danger', 'there', 'surrendering', 'skepticism', 'words', 'superstition', 'supernatural', 'are', 'often', 'confused', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'depictions', 'supernatural', 'can', 'be', 'avoided', 'even', 'religious', 'films', 'mistake', 'Padre', 'Pio', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'make.Still', 'quality', 'movie', 'Saint', 'Claire', 'view', 'faith', 'Francis', 'found', 'very', 'encouraging', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'find', 'faith', 'good', 'deeds', 'inspiring', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'too', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'dazzled', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'sort', 'thing']",Clare and Francis

But this is the best of them all.  It isn't perfect, and neither will it appeal to everyone.  However, as one who has been a franciscan devotee for most of his life, I give this two-part italian tv movie two thumbs up.It lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes, approximately, and feels dragging at times.  That's the bad.The good is much better.Actors: Ettore Bassi is the best St. Francis yet.  His interpretation has more warmth and range than Dillman's, conveys ""jesterhood"" authentically without looking spaced out like Graham Faulkner, and is just simply more believable in his interactions with the poor than Mickey Rourke.  Mary Petruolo shows us many aspects of St. Claire, from an innocent youth to motherly abbess, without the audience having to suspend one's intellect too much.  Also, I was particularly impressed with her acting during the scene where Claire confronts her uncle.History: One can divide this movie into two concurrent biographies: Claire and Francis.  Each biography (or should I say hagiography?) can be divided into stages, and each stage is close enough to traditional sources versions that I can safely call this film the most historically accurate.  Most movies talk about the Church of San Damiano, but this is the first one I know to mention Our Lady of the Angels.  Francis of Assisi mentions the Porziuncula once, that's it.  I don't recall Rivo Torto as being mentioned in the film but that is no big loss.The pivotal scene where Francis renounces his inheritance is done well here.  It was omitted in Francis of Assisi, overdone in Brother Sun, and doesn't quite have the same ""mmph"" in Francesco.  His audience with the Pope is also done well, and I'm glad it was mentioned that ""radical poverty"" was also practiced by heretics of the time such as the cathari, but it was obedience that convinced the Pope to approve the Friars Minor.Mood: When I think of the various St. Francis movies, I can always pinpoint what ""mood"" the producers are after.  Francis of Assisi wanted to present him as a holy man.  Francesco as a radical, and Brother Sun Sister Moon as a hippie.  Claire and Francis, to me, presents a balanced view.  He is also presented as ever obedient to the Church, something lacking in many presentations of the character.I especially love that first line that Francis says to a young Clare, ""Go and don't look back""  It sets the tone of the whole film as going through one's path and never looking back.Another reviewer commented that miracles were not shown in this movie.  If you think about it, miracles are never the selling point of Saint Francis movies, but this one did show several which I won't spoil for readers.  I therefore beg to disagree with the statement about lack of miracles.  But miracles are not the point of St. Francis' life - it's his life and how his had changed others.  This was perfectly seen here with Clare.  At the same time, one does not get the feeling that Francis dominates Clare.
