Well, this is Shakleton's Antartic Adventure.The mission, looks simple, as long as things go well. Weather is not always to our tune, especially in the Anatartic. Water turns snow, and, beleive it, you have to wait till the next season to come and melt away the snow. And they waited, at last to know that the ship (Endurance) that brought them is of no use. The life boats help them to continue their voyage, with limited water and food but the objective never shaken. The team splits, takes rough and tough ways, to complete their mission.I wonder what is the point in making such a mission in a land of unknown. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, especially in IMAX, the mission did not make sense to me at all. Like the one Steve Fossett made in balloon across the world... What is the point in making a mission when we have sophisticated flights that take us. Well, that is my view.One can definitely enjoy visiting the country - no one dares to - sitting from your couch, for sure.",4,Very well taken but ...,1031961600,"09 14, 2002",2002,1172,"['Huge', 'icebergs', 'snow', 'chilled', 'water', 'everywhere', 'single', 'wrecked', 'ship', 'couple', 'life', 'boats', '27', 'men', 'unified', 'saga', 'one', 'man', 'dream', 'crossing', 'Antartic', 'land..', 'Well', 'Shakleton', 'Antartic', 'Adventure.The', 'mission', 'simple', 'as', 'long', 'things', 'go', 'well', 'Weather', 'not', 'always', 'tune', 'especially', 'Anatartic', 'Water', 'snow', 'beleive', 'have', 'wait', 'till', 'next', 'season', 'come', 'melt', 'away', 'snow', 'waited', 'last', 'know', 'ship', 'Endurance', 'brought', 'use', 'life', 'boats', 'help', 'continue', 'voyage', 'limited', 'water', 'food', 'objective', 'never', 'shaken', 'team', 'splits', 'rough', 'tough', 'ways', 'complete', 'mission.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'making', 'such', 'mission', 'land', 'unknown', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'especially', 'IMAX', 'mission', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'Steve', 'Fossett', 'made', 'balloon', 'world', 'What', 'point', 'making', 'mission', 'when', 'have', 'sophisticated', 'flights', 'take', 'Well', 'view.One', 'can', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'visiting', 'country', 'one', 'sitting', 'couch', 'sure']",Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure

I then watched the 3 DVD collector's set and sat riveted to my seat for almost 5 hours watching both the film and the history of Antarctic Exploration extras. So, if you want the IMAX version, which is short and sort of sweet to the point, then here it is. On the other hand, if you want to really get a feel for the whole adventure and become part of it, then get the 3 DVD box set. I will watch both again and again.

714189,A3C73MTBWBJGM2,B00006FMCA,Himanshu Shangari,"[3, 3]","A very inspiring concept executed very well by Imax. Full marks to them for doing so. Team leader Shackelton and his team of 27 men start from South Georgia for antarctic trip. Their ship is trapped in snow and they are forced to disembark. Hope to recover the ship as the ice melts keeps them near it for 4 months and tragically as the ice starts melting after 4 months it shatters and drowns the ship. Starting a journey on lifeboats and touching different grounds of ice and leaving so many of colleagues at different places, Shackelton finally reaches the land after 17 months and manages to go back with some help and get back all his men. A masterpiece of human courage and endurance that is very rarely seen.

714191,AU69ERKOK9ZSJ,B00006FMCA,Nicholas Dujmovic,"[4, 4]","A beautiful, romantic, but too short treatment of Shackleton's expedition.  My son and I saw this after seeing the Discovery documentary ""The Endurance"" and after watching the Kevin Branagh film--and this order worked.  From the Discovery program you get the facts, the movie (with all its flaws) was more than adequate, and then the IMAX is a gorgeous treatment that combines the period photography of expedition shutterbug Frank Hurley, stunning modern shots of the landscape, and just a judicious bit of historical re-enactment (thankfully not too much).  Well done!

Correction, though -- Kevin Spacey is NOT an actor in this film, he's the narrator. There are no real ""actors""...the crew and the 3 mountaineers portrayed the original Endurance crew, and did a great job!I've had my initial copies for 2-3 years, which have the blue dot on back (meaning the corrected Dolby track), and also an inside cover slip with a night photo of The Endurance, and a list of Scene Selections.Amazon assured on its site that they sell only the corrected, blue dot, versions of the film, so I ordered 2 more as gifts, and 5 to have on hand for friends and such. And AMAZON is the vendor...not someone outside of Amazon.The copies that I just received from Amazon are NOT the corrected blue dot versions, nor do they have the inside slip cover with photo and scenes.I emailed customer service (I couldn't understand the foreign accent of the rep that answered my phone call), and they assured me that they would overnight replacements, and I could then send the ""wrong ones"" back. (I was afraid that this choice of words spelled trouble, and this proved true.)The replacements came today, and THEY TOO ARE THE DEFECTIVE VERSIONS! I have now inquired of a completely different vendor (outside of Amazon), to see if THEIRS are the corrected version. I'll send ALL 12 of these defective ones back to Amazon, since I can't seem to talk (or email) with anyone who understands the issue.I've had great success with Amazon for years...but the fact that they appear to outsource their service to a foreign country is not only disappointing, but frustrating as well.

In its 41 minutes, I was riveted and in complete awe. The photography of that very mysterious Antarctica was exquisite: the 2000/01 photography as well as the original. I cheered the great Shackleton and his crew, but was concerned about their faithful dogs (I'm not a PETA freak, I just like good dogs). I know there are other, longer and more detailed versions of Shackleton's trip. I'm happy to have seen this version. It was concise, and told me enough to know that Shackleton is a great man, an adventurer to be revered and admired in perpetuity. A bleak adventure, children should see this as a lesson in perseverence and fortitude.
