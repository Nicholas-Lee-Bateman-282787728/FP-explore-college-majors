Burchfield,"[12, 16]","Same outrageous comedy/action as in the first three seasons- that's good.The color/picture restoration is good (on the couple of episodes I've watched so far) and I haven't noticed any sound trouble- that's also good.This time around you get only 26 episodes instead of 30-32 and no extras of any sort- that's really a cheap stunt for the DVD people to pull. No deleted scenes, no subtitling (it is closed captioned), no added extras (season 2 had several very good ones), not a single episode has a commentary or added photo gallery. This time around the producers didn't even bother to thank the surviving cast members and their families, you get nothing beyond episode dates and outlines on the DVD cases.The set is well worth owning, I just hope that when season 5 comes out someone puts out some extras of some sort- they really add to the experience.",4,"Good escapist TV, but with NO extras",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,856,"['Same', 'outrageous', 'comedy/action', 'first', 'three', 'seasons-', 'good.The', 'color/picture', 'restoration', 'good', 'couple', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'sound', 'trouble-', 'also', 'good.This', 'time', 'get', 'only', '26', 'episodes', 'instead', '30-32', 'extras', 'sort-', 'really', 'cheap', 'stunt', 'DVD', 'people', 'pull', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'subtitling', 'closed', 'captioned', 'added', 'extras', 'season', '2', 'had', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'not', 'single', 'episode', 'commentary', 'added', 'photo', 'gallery', 'time', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'thank', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'families', 'get', 'nothing', 'episode', 'dates', 'outlines', 'DVD', 'cases.The', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'hope', 'when', 'season', '5', 'out', 'someone', 'out', 'extras', 'sort-', 'really', 'add', 'experience']",Hogan's Heroes - The Complete Fourth Season

995368,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000FSME1K,Kevin R. Austra,"[2, 2]","The Fourth Season of HOGAN'S HEROES picks up right where the Third Season ended.  HOGAN'S HEROES was one of the few series where, with the exception of Ivan Dixon's departure toward the end of the show's run, there were no drastic changes season to season.  That is probably why the series did so well in syndication in that you could mix and match or otherwise view the episodes in any order without losing continuity.  Even those shows that did harken back to an earlier storyline, like Klink's recurring encounters with General Burkhalter's sister, could well stand on their own merit.Much as we noted in the second half of Season Three, the overall story lines were a little more vague regarding the war's timeline.  In Season Four we have additional references to Stalingrad as if it were an on-going campaign.Toward the end of the fourth season there are an increasing number of out-of-camp episodes with Hogan and his crew found in the local hotel, a hospital, or a German headquarters.  There are also more episodes with Burkhalter and Hochstetter appearing in the same show.  I still marvel at the fact that the outdoor Stalag 13 set was only separated from sprawling Culver City by tree studded earthen berm.  Overall the production team did a fantastic job in making us believe that the camp was out in the county somewhere.  Season four is the first time you can spot two California palm trees sneaking into the scene over background barracks roofs.As the show neared the end of the 1960s the number of episodes per season also dropped.  Season Four contains 26 shows.  That is still a healthy number when you consider the pitiful number of episodes boasted by today's half-hour television series.Hogan and his team have changed very little.  Schultz is just as lovable as he was in the earlier episodes.  His boyish expressions still steal every scene, even when he is in the background.  At times Klink's character is a slightly stricter than in previous seasons.  No doubt this was to refresh the notion that the POWs were still fairly new to the compound.  Despite its several year run, Season Four is still hilarious.About the only thing missing in this DVD set are special features.  When you buy Season Four you get just that.  Still it is worth the modest price to continue the HOGAN'S HEROES saga.",5,Fourth Season Still Going Strong,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2318,"['Fourth', 'Season', 'HOGAN', 'HEROES', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Third', 'Season', 'ended', 'HOGAN', 'HEROES', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'series', 'where', 'exception', 'Ivan', 'Dixon', 'departure', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'were', 'drastic', 'changes', 'season', 'season', 'probably', 'why', 'series', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'syndication', 'could', 'mix', 'match', 'otherwise', 'view', 'episodes', 'order', 'losing', 'continuity', 'Even', 'shows', 'did', 'harken', 'back', 'earlier', 'storyline', 'Klink', 'recurring', 'encounters', 'General', 'Burkhalter', 'sister', 'could', 'well', 'stand', 'own', 'merit.Much', 'noted', 'second', 'half', 'Season', 'Three', 'overall', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'vague', 'regarding', 'war', 'timeline', 'Season', 'Four', 'have', 'additional', 'references', 'Stalingrad', 'were', 'on-going', 'campaign.Toward', 'end', 'fourth', 'season', 'are', 'increasing', 'number', 'out-of-camp', 'episodes', 'Hogan', 'crew', 'found', 'local', 'hotel', 'hospital', 'German', 'headquarters', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'episodes', 'Burkhalter', 'Hochstetter', 'appearing', 'same', 'show', 'still', 'marvel', 'fact', 'outdoor', 'Stalag', '13', 'set', 'was', 'only', 'separated', 'sprawling', 'Culver', 'City', 'tree', 'studded', 'earthen', 'berm', 'production', 'team', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'camp', 'was', 'out', 'county', 'somewhere', 'Season', 'four', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'spot', 'two', 'California', 'palm', 'trees', 'sneaking', 'scene', 'background', 'barracks', 'roofs.As', 'show', 'neared', 'end', '1960s', 'number', 'episodes', 'season', 'also', 'dropped', 'Season', 'Four', '26', 'shows', 'still', 'healthy', 'number', 'when', 'consider', 'pitiful', 'number', 'episodes', 'boasted', 'today', 'half-hour', 'television', 'series.Hogan', 'team', 'have', 'changed', 'very', 'little', 'Schultz', 'just', 'as', 'lovable', 'was', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'boyish', 'expressions', 'still', 'steal', 'scene', 'even', 'when', 'background', 'times', 'Klink', 'character', 'slightly', 'stricter', 'previous', 'seasons', 'doubt', 'was', 'refresh', 'notion', 'POWs', 'were', 'still', 'fairly', 'new', 'compound', 'several', 'year', 'run', 'Season', 'Four', 'still', 'hilarious.About', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'When', 'buy', 'Season', 'Four', 'get', 'just', 'Still', 'modest', 'price', 'continue', 'HOGAN', 'HEROES', 'saga']",Hogan's Heroes - The Complete Fourth Season

Yes, the subject is controversial, but our appreciation for the comedic acting talent and writing just increases with each episode.  Really!  The stage presence of the main actors is so good!

The characters have been developed, and yet as WW II grew darker, so must the attitude of Hogan and his men.  But the hilarity of the zany capers they pull off is still in fine form.
