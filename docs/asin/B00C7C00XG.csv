That it is a good example is terrific. It shows how almost impossible it is to have ""adult supervision"" in a tech industry that the young most naturally gravitate to decoding.  Think about it; who remembers not emailing ?  Perhaps the reason it did not do better at the box office is that we are too attuned to our cyber and internet selves to see what possible problems arise.  We think ourselves sophisticated, but already we have seen examples of taunting, suicide, and murder facilitated by our internet avatars.  DISCONNECT is a well written thriller that involves three scenarios involving 3 relationship disconnects, and what if anything can be done to ameliorate the situations.  Hope appears to be slight but apparent by face to face confrontation.  It will be reminescent of Babel, Crash (although this is better) and multi centered naratives.

Curious because Disconnect is ""modeled"" after Crash's style which was of course ""modeled"" after Inarritu's Amores Perros. Anyway, it worked well. It seems Jason Bateman is the No.1 choice for computer/internet movies. Where was he when they making Pi? Disconnect, like Crash, is slick entertainment. It poses several different scenarios where computers are at the root of a catastrophe and runs those scenarios simultaneously in parallel ""not"" unlike Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams and Crash or Seinfeld's better episodes. It's not quite totally full of BS like Crash. It's certainly well played but like Crash it plays to your sensibilities. It panders. But it does it very well.

1643709,A25L1GQF65K55K,B00C7C00XG,Craig Haynes,"[0, 0]","Disconnect provides a cautionary tale to all of us who have been unconsciously seduced/blinded by all the shiny technological toys and apps we now (and will) use and deploy. Decidedly, these toys and apps are a two-edged sword--providing a form of comfort and solace for some, but also capable of inflicting enormous pain and suffering to scores of others. This film tries to demonstrate both sides of the coin and I think, does so admirably--extending the impact down to the ""real"" people involved--the faces behind the digits. Some may not appreciate that the filmmakers tread a fine line in finding redemption and 'justice,' i.e., no one goes unpunished or unaffected in this story. There are no heroes. There is no resolution that satisfies in the traditional sense. Everyone is culpable in some way, because all have been taken-in by and seduced by the technology. And of course, the irony is that with all the hyper-connectivity we have (technologically-speaking), there is a colossal hyper-disconnection (socially-speaking) which has occurred. Our innate sense of justice wants revenge, but the filmmakers remind us that we all have a part in the negative and positive aspects of new technology. The filmmakers don't even posit any possible answers, like ""use technology, don't let it use you."" In the end, everyone is going to have to be hyper vigilant, but the reality of the dangers that lurk often are not fully appreciated until individuals personally must confront them head-on.

The lessons to be learned here are important.  The Internet has changed the way that people communicate and the cloak of anonymity has changed the kinds of things that people are willing to share.  The first five minutes or so of the movie are VERY graphic, so please be advised of that.  I'm sure it is to try and hit you hard right at the beginning, but I'm not sure the shock value is really warranted.This movie is dark and contains a few main story lines.  One is of a teenage boy who is living in a ""porn house"" and doing cam shows for people for money and the reporter who wants to tell his story and keep him safe.  Another is of a friendless teenage boy who is duped by a couple of classmates into thinking he is talking on Facebook to a girl at another nearby school.  The last follows a couple after the loss of their young child where the husband internalizes his grief and the wife turns to a man in an Internet chat room to talk about her feelings.None of these story lines could exist without the Internet and I believe the movie does hit home in trying to show the dark side of the technology that we have all grown to rely upon.  It also spotlights the irony that even though we live in a world where we can communicate easily with people around the world we seem to be having a harder time communicating one on one and face to face.The performances here are pretty good across the board.  I am a fan of Jason Bateman and was impressed with him here in a very serious role as the father of the friendless teenage boy.It is hard to say a lot more without some spoilers here, I will say that even though as a tech guy I had a couple of ""are you kidding me?"" moments overall I found the movie to be realistic and hold my interest from start to finish.The bottom line here is this movie deals with some very real issues that everyone should at least be aware of.

With so many engaging but fundamentally flawed, mediocre, or downright awful films coming out in the last few years, it completely restored my faith in today's movie-making industry.The protagonists in DISCONNECT have one thing in common: Their lives are seriously, sometimes tragically, disrupted by online misadventures involving identity theft, cyber-bullying, and child pornography. The empathy conveyed in this film is powerful. DISCONNECT makes you wish you could just leap through the screen and beg all its unwitting players to do exactly as the title says.Stellar performances by just about everyone, with particular kudos going to Andrea Riseborough as television reporter Nina Dunham, Max Theriot as the 18-year-old online interactive porno model who Dunham befriends and reports on, and Colin Ford and Aviad Bernstein as the two punkishly convincing cyber-bullies. The themes of guilt, reconciliation, and how we're all both oppressors and victims shine through quite clearly.

The number of identity thefts, suicides, fraudulent dealings, and the accompanying waste of human brain time from the ever-present cellphone or pad or laptop has grown to appalling proportions and it just may help for the general audience to watch this film and witness how deleterious our `advanced communication' has become. Written by Andrew Stern and directed with phenomenal sensitivity and dexterity by Henry Alex Rubin (both rather newcomers on the cinema scene), this is a film that deserves wide recognition at awards time and definitely wide attendance by audiences.Hard-working lawyer Rich Boyd (Jason Bateman), attached to his cell phone, can't find the time to communicate with his wife Lydia (Hope Davis) and son Ben (Jonah Bobo) and daughter Abby (Haley Ramm). A couple (Alexander Skarsgrd and Paula Patton) is drawn into a dangerous situation while investigating the computer hacking of their complete finances when their own secrets are exposed online: they stalk a simple worker Stephen Schumacher (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes caught up in their obsession.  A widowed ex-cop (Frank Grillo) struggles to raise a mischievous son Jason (Colin Ford) who with his cohort Frye (Aviad Bernstein) cyber-bullies a classmate, the haunted and taunted musician Ben. An ambitious journalist Nina Dunham (Andrea Riseborough) sees a career-making story in teen Kyle (Max Thieriot) who performs porn on an adult-only chatroom. They are strangers, neighbors and colleagues and their stories collide in this riveting dramatic thriller about ordinary people struggling to connect in today's wired world. It takes a suicide attempt to tie all of these stories together.Every member of this cast is excellent, the pacing of the film is over the speed limit as well it should be, and the manner in which each of these seemingly disparate stories is told in overlapping fashion and finally in impressive slow motion pushes this cinematic piece into an art work with a blisteringly tough message. It is a wakeup call, hopefully not too late to change. Highly recommended.

This recent trend has permeated everything we do; if you don't believe me, take a look: LOL; BFF; OMG; W8; BTW; BYOB (kidding...); FYI; ETA; ASAP; RSVP (well, okay... not EVERYTHING is recent)....With this in mind, brace yourself for an exciting film that addresses our digital world, with grief counseling chat rooms, cyber bullying, on-line sex, and identity theft, plus general e-mails, texting, GPS units and Facebook. It is NOT boring; there isn't a wasted scene, an unnecessary line or a plot hole left unfilled. Kudos to director Henry Alex Rubin (""Murderball"" - a terrific documentary) and scriptwriter Andrew Stern (""Return to Me"" - one of my favorites), for a movie about moral dilemmas and ethical quicksand that keep us engaged and involved every step of the way.We see:* Jason Bateman (""Identity Thief"") is a successful attorney named Rich, whose adolescent son is very troubled. Dad puts it down to normal teenage angst. Bateman just gets better and better; he is extremely effective in this one!* Hope Davis (""Real Steel"") is Lydia, the mother of that same boy; she is more alarmed by their son's behavior than her husband. This actress never makes a misstep; how does she do it?* Jonah Bobo (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is Ben, their awkward teenage son who is the target of cyber bullying. Our hearts go out to this kid as we share his misery.* Haley Ramm (Lots of TV) is Abby, the loyal but embarrassed sister of the dorky misfit. This young lady has developed into a terrific actress.* Alexander Skarsgrd (""True Blood"") gives us Derek, a successful fellow we can relate to; however, his toddler died, his wife is grief-stricken, his marriage is on ice, and his identity has just been stolen. The whole Skarsgrd family is amazing; in this film, you can't tell he's from Sweden!* Paula Patton (""Ghost Protocol"") is Cindy, Derek's grieving wife, who visits the chat room without his knowledge. With their bank accounts in limbo, it is a short, humiliating slide to living in a motel.* Michael Nyqvist (""As It Is In Heaven"") is Stephen Shoemacher, whom Cindy meets in that grief therapy chat room.* Frank Grillo (""Warrior"") is a former cop, now a cyber crime expert, hired to investigate identity theft. He's really good with computers (so's his son...). I'm keeping my eye on this actor!* Max Thieriot (""The Family Tree"") plays Kyle, the (very) handsome, (very) charming, (very) young man who makes his living via on-line porn. This former child actor has developed into an appealing capable actor! (He reminds me of a young Ryan Phillippi...and that's good!)This involving film runs four parallel stories with no confusion, building each to a crashing climax and we never question which story we're seeing.

They have their identities stolen on the InternetNina (Andrea Riseborough) is an ambitious television reporterwho strikes up a webcam conversation with an 18-year-old Internet sex model (Max Thieriot) in the hopes of interviewing him for an expose on the predators who recruit teen girls and boys to become online porn performers.Jason (Colin Ford) and Frye (Aviad Bernstein) are kids who target nerd Ben (Jonah Bobo) for an extended online prank in which they pose as a fictional girl with a Facebook crush on Ben.All of these conflicts and relationships are initiated through the Internet. People fall in love, exploit one another, reveal their deepest secrets and even commit felonious acts -- all before there's a single face-to-face meeting.  The movie does a decent job of laying out the case in each story so we can understand how all these smart people can make such dumb decisions and act in such a reckless manner while on the net.Jason Bateman gives a good performance and Colin Ford does a good job, as Jason, the online bully who begins to feel remorse about torturing the nerdy kid.At times, the movie meanders along without a direction and ends up with no real satisfying answers but this movie is a decent one to watch but not terribly original.

I rented the video because I wanted to know what was going on with Cindy and Derek, but as I watched I became more interested in Jason's story.  What I saw was an unhappy teen; he didn't get the attention he needed from his father, so he acted out. The consequences of his actions were tragic.My thoughts while viewing: Some people make choices giving no thought to how someone else's life will be affected. It is very important for married couples to communicate. Some parents aren't as attentive to their children as they should be, putting career before family is never good. Siblings really should learn how to appreciate each other. It's a shame that it takes a tragedy to get some people to see what's most important in life.  Some people seek love and affection any way they can get it, even if it isn't true love that nurtures and protects. In the wrong hands, the internet can be a dangerous thing; people really need to be sure who they're dealing with online and MUST take safety precautions.I didn't care for the nudity and sexual dialogue (this film didn't sugarcoat, that's for sure), but Disconnect was interesting, thought-provoking and well-acted.

1643754,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00C7C00XG,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","With an admirably economic use of dialogue, a strong soundtrack that does double duty as connective tissue, and some first-rate performances, DISCONNECT tells three intertwined stories of people whose lives are torn apart by the darker uses of the internet. There is an investigative journalist who convinces a young webcam stripper to tell-all for a report, a teen who is the victim of some particularly malicious cyber-bullying, and a recently-childless couple who find their bank accounts drained by an identity thief.Some might think the plot moves slowly, while others might feel the interconnection is a little too convenient, and another group might be annoyed the film's stubborn lack of answers (let's just say the stories aren't meant to be about resolution). However, if you're a fan of artistry in film -- especially with pacing, framing, and editing -- then the film won't disappoint. It is elegantly crafted, and as I said before, nearly every performance is a masterful example of understatement. Especially surprising is the normally comedic Jason Bateman as the father of the bullied teen.I'd give the film full stars if it weren't for just a few lags in the plot. Two of the fathers in the film are presented as being horrible parents, but -- while certainly not the greatest dads in the world -- they also didn't seem as especially egregious as the movie makes them out to be. Also, the film seems to be tackling some low-hanging fruit. These issues with the internet -- porn, identity theft, and cyber bullying -- don't require a whole lot of finesse or subtext to strike a chord, and the movie doesn't really do anything new with the subject matter other than seem to say, ""Man, this whole situation kind of sucks, doesn't it?"" without offering much in the way of a solution other than a call to basic humanity, which also seems to kind of suck in the end as well. In the end, while a moving portrayal of life in the digital age, it is also a rather nihilistic and removed film, which is ironic given its overall position on nihilism and human disconnection.",4,"""Crash"" ...

1643759,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00C7C00XG,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","There may be spoilers.This isn't the first and won't be the last film about the potential dangers of the internet age.  Still, the film gets its point across successfully.  Leading up to the beginning of this Blu ray version, there is an ad for a Blu ray disc being offered for the controversial Oscar winner of 2005, ""Crash.""  It seemed a bit unusual at the time, but after watching this film, the comparisons are obvious.The film has four storylines that don't really intersect all that much but have the common denominator of an internet connection.  The editors do a very good job of keeping the storylines distinct while they crisscross from one event to another.  Derek and Cindy Hull (Alexander Skarsgard and Paula Patton) are a couple whose once perfect marriage is undergoing the strain of child loss.  Derek has become distant, doesn't want to talk about it and spends too much time playing video poker.  Cindy unable to communicate with Derek joins an on-line chat room for people who have lost close family members.  She is especially ""close"" to a man (Michael Nyqvist) who has lost his wife.  When their identity is stolen, their financial situation becomes dire.They hire a security specialist, Mike Dixon (Frank Grillo), a former cop who is raising his son Jason (Colin Ford) alone due to the death of his wife and Jason's mother.  Jason is part of a pair of high school hooligans who enjoy practical jokes, including harmful ones.  They think it would be cool to haze one of the Goth-geek types named Ben (Jonah Bobo) by pretending to be an attractive girl at his school.  An exchange of explicit photos via the web, leads to tragedy.  Ben's father Rich (Jason Bateman), an attorney too busy to pay much attention to Ben and his sister while they were growing up, is now determined to find out why and what led up to his son's hospitalization.The final, and least effective story involves Nina Dunham (Andrea Riseborough), an ambitious TV reporter who decides to do a feature on websites that provide paid ""chats"" with young people who perform sex acts for payment.  After she induces one 18 year old guy to do an interview to be aired on TV, she draws the attention of the FBI but doesn't want to get her subject in trouble.  Problems ensue.Directed by Henry Alex Rubin (""Murderball""), the film certainly has its moments and is rarely dull if sometimes improbable.  I was especially impressed with Bateman in one of his rare fully dramatic role.  He has the goods and he delivers.  Most of issues with the film are in some of the unlikely details, especially involving the high school kids.  Still this is a film worth watching.  A cautionary tale for the modern internet age.The Blu ray package from Lionsgate looks fine in its 1080p resolution.  It maintains the film's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  This isn't one of those demo quality eye-popping transfers but why would you expect it.  It does seem to have an amber hue overall which sometimes looks a bit hazy in distant shots.  Close ups are excellent with sharp clear features.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Again, I think what we should hope for in a dialog driven film like this is clarity and it's there.  There are a few scenes at school and outdoors where the surrounds provide a bit of sound but otherwise, the sound is well centered.  Subtitles include English SDH and Spanish.

1643766,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7C00XG,Paul Allaer,"[3, 4]","""Disconnect"" (2012 release; 115 min.) brings three parallel yet loosely connected storylines, which all have to do with the ever-present risks of living in a wired world: in the first story, Ben, a high school teenager, is tricked by classmates into sexting a compromising picture of himself, with devastating consequences. In the second story line, a young married couple discovers that their on-line identity has been stolen, resulting in, among other things, their bank account being emptied, and they are bent on finding out who did this. And in the third story line, an up-and-coming female TV reporter convinces an underage young man working as a chatroom entertainer to give her an ""inside scoop"" interview about his world. To tell you more about how these three stories will unfold, and how exactly they are interconnected with each other, would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this is the fiction movie debut of director Henry-Alex Rubin, who previously made several great documentaries, including the top notch ""Murderball"" a few years back. Rubin does a great job bringing these stories in a convincing way, never letting up on the tension throughout the movie. The irony is that, while we have never been more interconnected (via internet, social media, computers and whatever else), the disconnect between people has never been greater. There are several noteworthy performances in the movie: Jason Bates plays a lawyer (and father of the HS teenage son) and carries the dramatic weight of the movie quite nicely. For smaller but even juicier roles, keep your eye out for Marc Jacobs, yes THAT fashion designer, in his first starring role (as the recruiter of the chatroom workers), as well as an even smaller roler (about 10 min. of screen time) for Michael Nyqvist, best known for his role in the original Millenium/Dragon Tattoo movie franchise from Sweden (and here as the guy who possibly may have stolen the on-line identity of the couple). Music plays an important role in the movie (and in particular in Ben's life), and the movie soundtrack is generally stellar, although I found it strange that even though Sigur Ros is one of Ben's favorite bands, the music heard over the closing credits is not from Sigur Ros, instead the song ""Thunder"" is actually from the 2010 solo album of Jonsi, the band's singer.

1643775,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00C7C00XG,Sean Pasek,"[23, 27]","""Disconnect"" may be one of the most thought-provoking films to come down the pike in recent years that paints an accurate and frightening image of what life looks like now, due to our dependence on the internet, and where it might lead if people don't realize the damage that is being done.  The internet is a powerful, useful tool, but the daily abuse of it is almost beyond the scope of comprehending.  ""Disconnect"" gives us an idea about how widespread and frequent that abuse is.There is a certain amount of irony that our world has become so much closer in the way we communicate.  We can literally converse with almost anyone on the planet.  I grew up during a time when pen-pal letters from school was about as ""close"" as I ever got to talking to someone from another country.  However, the closer we have become with our communication, the larger the chasm in our connections with others.""Disconnect"" focuses on three main story-lines.  The first involves, Ben Boyd, a young high school boy who is basically a loner and an outsider.  It's clear that he has few, if any, friends, and he spends much of his time writing and composing music.  Even his family seems to barely acknowledge him, especially his father, a successful lawyer who is always busy and even finds his son to be a bit odd as well.  Two kids at his school decide to play a ""prank"" on him by setting up an online profile, and masquerading as a girl who is interested in Ben and his music, thus taking advantage of his vulnerable state of wanting to connect with someone.  I don't think a film has ever given us a clearer or scarier depiction of the kind of damage people can do through manipulating others, especially online where you have no idea who you are talking to.The second story-line involves young, ambitious reporter, Nina Dunham who decides to do a piece of investigative journalism about runaway teens and the jobs that many of them end up doing online in order to make money.  She connects with Kyle online and disguises herself as a customer in order to establish a connection and get her story.  Little does she realize the avalanche of trouble that this causes, not only for Kyle, but for herself as well.The third story-line involves a young married couple, Derek and Cindy Hull, trying to deal with the loss of their infant son.  They don't talk to each other much, and Cindy's only outlet of communication is within a chat room where she finds solace in an unknown person who listens to her anguish and pain.  Suddenly, their worlds are tossed upside down when someone infiltrates their computer system and steals most of their money.The performances in this film are all first-rate.  I have not seen Jason Bateman tackle a role this deep and complex, and he is fantastic as Rich Boyd who is trying to find out what happened with his son as well as finding out who is responsible.  And while his anger is obvious toward the perpetrators, he quickly finds that much of that anger is toward himself.  Spending nearly every moment online and dealing with clients, he barely has time for anyone in his family, and he quickly sees what that indifference has cost him.The movie does not depict the characters in any form of ""black"" or ""white.""  Each character is complex, and we find ourselves sympathizing, to some extent, with all of them.  Perhaps that is why this film is so realistic and layered, just as people are in life.  We may not know the reasons for why people do the things that they do, but as the story progresses, we begin to understand the motivation.""Disconnect"" is literally a must-see film.  It will force you to ask yourself how much time do you spend online every day?  How often do you converse and interact with people online as opposed to face-to-face?  How much time do you spend with your family as opposed to being online?  And how much manipulation and cruelty is perpetrated by kids every day toward other kids that they dislike by using the power of the internet to hurt them and exploit their vulnerabilities?  The internet has made it so easy to disconnect from people.  People feel safer and more comfortable in front of a monitor than dealing with others or themselves.  We have heard it before: information is power.  And it is incredibly frightening to see just how powerful it is, and how much damage can be caused when it is abused.  The scary part about this movie is that each of these abuses are small reflections of what is going on every single day around the world, and we know that they are!  And still others have, themselves, been a victim of some form of the type of violations that are depicted here.Our dependence and reliance on technology for disconnecting, and not having to deal with people face-to-face is greater than at any other time in history.  And the danger is just as real and poignant as the film depicts.  I hope this movie serves to ""awaken "" people to how they are spending their time, how much they are connecting with the people that they love in their lives, and how much they use the internet to disconnect from those same people and the problems that they choose not to face.",5,Powerfully Disturbing Portrayal of the Disconnection in Today's World,1379894400,"09 23,

From a young boy on a sex-cam site to a reporter trying to help him. From a struggling married couple who has their life taken or a family who has the unthinkable happen to them. Even the littlest most innocent action or a prank that goes too far can explode into something that can ruin lives. There are very few movies that come out that I think are must sees for different reasons then it just being good and fun to watch. The last movie I can think of like that would be Trust, the movie about a young girl meeting someone online who she thinks is a boy her age. This one has that type of feel. The movie will show you the power that the internet can have and how that is not always a good thing. This is a movie that has three separate story lines going on at once and all of them hold your attention and the movie grabs you and holds you until the end. This is a must see especially for parents to show their high school kids to show what a seemingly innocent prank can turn into. Overall, an important movie that needs to be seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I give it a B+.",4,A movie that needs to be seen by parents and high school students.

1643783,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00C7C00XG,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Before directing 'Disconnect', Henry Alex Rubin was mainly known for making TV commercials. 'Disconnect', his first feature, employs three separate stories, focusing on a theme of how the internet can 'disconnect' people (as well as ultimately 'connect' them).The most compelling of the three stories involves cyberbullying. Jason and his friend Frye, target Ben, a socially inept fellow student, on Facebook, by pretending to be a sexy co-ed, Jessica Rhony (an anagram for 'Horny'). Ben is lured into sending them a lewd picture of himself with his pants down and the boys promptly send it to all their fellow students on Facebook.This is how tragedies develop and 'Disconnect' cogently shows the sequence of events that leads Ben to hang himself (the oxygen deprived boy ends up in a coma). Eventually, Ben's father, Rich, an attorney, discovers that Jason is responsible for the ruse and ends up confronting the boy, along with his father, Mike, a former cop, now turned private detective.We find out why Jason turned out to be a cyberbully as the father-son relationship is dissected. Mike is a strict martinet with his son, causing the boy to be deeply resentful of the father. But when Mike discovers Jason is responsible for the cyberbullying of Ben, he destroys the son's hard drive and physically defends him, after Rich comes over and strikes the boy with a hockey stick. Father and son will finally bond but at the expense of the truth: Rich will never get any satisfaction in seeing Jason brought to the bar of justice in juvenile court.Less successful of the three stories, involves a go-getting TV reporter, Nina, who convinces the young chatroom stripper, Kyle, to be the subject of a TV interview. Eventually the FBI attempts to force Nina to reveal Kyle's employers. Kyle reluctantly gives her an address but somehow his group is tipped off, and they flee the location. Like Rich, Nina attempts to confront the bad guy and receives a punch in the face for her efforts. Kyle and his entourage flee and Nina learns a hard lesson that altruism with certain types of people, has its limits.The least successful of the three stories involves a troubled married couple who recently lost a child. Cindy and Derek are victims of identity theft and employ Mike (the private detective from the cyberbullying story) to track down who stole their credit cards. Mike initially determines that their suspect is a man who Cindy was communicating with on an online chat support group. Derek goes as far as breaking into the man's house and putting a rifle to his head but Cindy receives a call from Mike, that this man was also a victim and not responsible for the thefts. Cindy is able to convince Derek, a former Marine, to stand down, and a second tragedy is thankfully averted.Certainly, 'Disonnect' has some interesting stories to tell and holds your interest until the end. But all three stories sort of leave you hanging. I wanted a little more, perhaps with a twist. Nonetheless, the characters do have their epiphanies--especially Mike, with the self-revelation that he's been a hard ass with his son; Nina, in her quest for fame and glory that was not really worth taking and Cindy and Derek's desire to repair their marriage, only succeeding after Derek's deep-seated anger issues almost end in tragedy.Whether the larger the film attempts to address--the issue that the internet is responsible for the alienation of modern man--that's a subject I leave to the pundits who specialize in such higher philosophically-inclined ruminations.",3,Interesting trio of three internet tales have trouble resolving themselves,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,3588,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'directing', ""'Disconnect"", 'Henry', 'Alex', 'Rubin', 'was', 'mainly', 'known', 'making', 'TV', 'commercials', ""'Disconnect"", 'first', 'feature', 'three', 'separate', 'stories', 'focusing', 'theme', 'how', 'internet', 'can', ""'disconnect"", 'people', 'as', 'well', 'ultimately', ""'connect"", 'most', 'compelling', 'three', 'stories', 'cyberbullying', 'Jason', 'friend', 'Frye', 'target', 'Ben', 'socially', 'inept', 'fellow', 'student', 'Facebook', 'pretending', 'be', 'sexy', 'co-ed', 'Jessica', 'Rhony', 'anagram', ""'Horny"", 'Ben', 'lured', 'sending', 'lewd', 'picture', 'pants', 'down', 'boys', 'promptly', 'send', 'fellow', 'students', 'Facebook.This', 'how', 'tragedies', 'develop', ""'Disconnect"", 'cogently', 'sequence', 'events', 'Ben', 'hang', 'oxygen', 'deprived', 'boy', 'up', 'coma', 'Eventually', 'Ben', 'father', 'Rich', 'attorney', 'discovers', 'Jason', 'responsible', 'ruse', 'up', 'confronting', 'boy', 'father', 'Mike', 'former', 'cop', 'now', 'turned', 'private', 'detective.We', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Jason', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'cyberbully', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'dissected', 'Mike', 'strict', 'martinet', 'son', 'causing', 'boy', 'be', 'deeply', 'resentful', 'father', 'when', 'Mike', 'discovers', 'Jason', 'responsible', 'cyberbullying', 'Ben', 'son', 'hard', 'drive', 'physically', 'Rich', 'strikes', 'boy', 'hockey', 'stick', 'Father', 'son', 'will', 'finally', 'bond', 'expense', 'truth', 'Rich', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'Jason', 'brought', 'bar', 'justice', 'juvenile', 'court.Less', 'successful', 'three', 'stories', 'go-getting', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Nina', 'who', 'young', 'chatroom', 'stripper', 'Kyle', 'be', 'subject', 'TV', 'interview', 'Eventually', 'FBI', 'attempts', 'force', 'Nina', 'reveal', 'Kyle', 'employers', 'Kyle', 'reluctantly', 'address', 'somehow', 'group', 'tipped', 'off', 'flee', 'location', 'Rich', 'Nina', 'confront', 'bad', 'guy', 'punch', 'face', 'efforts', 'Kyle', 'entourage', 'flee', 'Nina', 'hard', 'lesson', 'altruism', 'certain', 'types', 'people', 'limits.The', 'least', 'successful', 'three', 'stories', 'troubled', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'child', 'Cindy', 'Derek', 'are', 'victims', 'identity', 'theft', 'employ', 'Mike', 'private', 'detective', 'cyberbullying', 'story', 'track', 'down', 'who', 'stole', 'credit', 'cards', 'Mike', 'initially', 'suspect', 'man', 'who', 'Cindy', 'was', 'communicating', 'online', 'chat', 'support', 'group', 'Derek', 'as', 'far', 'breaking', 'man', 'house', 'putting', 'rifle', 'head', 'Cindy', 'call', 'Mike', 'man', 'was', 'also', 'victim', 'not', 'responsible', 'thefts', 'Cindy', 'able', 'convince', 'Derek', 'former', 'Marine', 'stand', 'down', 'second', 'tragedy', 'thankfully', 'averted.Certainly', ""'Disonnect"", 'interesting', 'stories', 'tell', 'interest', 'end', 'three', 'stories', 'sort', 'leave', 'hanging', 'wanted', 'little', 'more', 'perhaps', 'twist', 'Nonetheless', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'epiphanies', 'especially', 'Mike', 'self-revelation', 'been', 'hard', 'ass', 'son', 'Nina', 'quest', 'fame', 'glory', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'taking', 'Cindy', 'Derek', 'desire', 'repair', 'marriage', 'only', 'succeeding', 'Derek', 'deep-seated', 'anger', 'issues', 'almost', 'end', 'larger', 'film', 'attempts', 'address', 'issue', 'internet', 'responsible', 'alienation', 'modern', 'man', 'subject', 'leave', 'pundits', 'who', 'specialize', 'such', 'higher', 'philosophically-inclined', 'ruminations']",N/A
