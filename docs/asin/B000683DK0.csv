862840,A1NPROXGAEEPHD,B000683DK0,"Amazon Customer ""Mrs. Snowman""","[0, 0]","I saw this on the Disney channel back when it first came out in 1985. At first I was bothered by Jonathan's (Huckleberry Fox)70's mullety hairstyle. Was he a boy or a girl? That and the fact that I walked in on the middle of the show where he's dressed in old-fashioned clothes must have added to my confusion on his gender, therefore leading to my initial biased opinion.But I was eventually drawn to it as my grandfather loved airplanes and had one of his own that he had built. I was drawn into the movie. I am not much of a sci-fi person so I find the thought of time travel very bizarre and hard to comprehend. So the movie was a bit strange, but really quite good.When it first came out on Disney, it was known as ""The Blue Yonder"", after pilot Max Knickerbocker's biplane. However, they later revised it and added more scenes (or maybe just added clips they cut out of Blue Yonder) and released it as the Disney Sunday Movie known as ""Time Flyer"". I liked that version best as it made more sense.Jonathan goes back in time to meet his grandfather Max and he is WAY out of place in his grandfather's world--including his 1980s flamboyant clothes. He acts like a goon! He should know he is in another time but of course he is just an ignorant kid. It is funny and interesting. One of my favorite scenes which was not on the original movie (Blue Yonder) was in ""Time Flyer"" when Jonathan walks into a MacDonald's and asks for a quarter pounder. Apparently MacDonald's didn't sell quarter pounders in those days!! (Or maybe that MacDonald's had nothing to do with the fast food chain--apparently if I remember correctly, it was a grocery store, and the fast food chain is spelled ""McDonalds""). I guess he goes back to the 20's...He eventually meets up with his grandfather Max, who shows Jonathan the ""smallest radio in the world"" with is gigantic to Jonathan, since he is from another time!! Jonathan sure gives himself away with his ignorance of that time era!!Max Knickerbocker is another Amelia Earhart; a male version, that is. He had set out on a flight and vanished, so Jonathan had gone back in time to try to stop him from making that fateful flight.Sad bittersweet movie!! Weird, thinking of going back in time to meet your grandparents who died before you were born, and to see your grandmother pregnant with your own father--and being able to tell your grandmother that yes, she is having a boy, because it's your father!! Fortunately Max finally believes him. After all, it is Max who thought up the theory of time travel, and years later his best friend (Jonathan's neighbor) Henry, who was dying of heart failure at the end of the movie, I guess had built the time machine but never tried it out but Jonathan decides to step up to the plate.It is good but I can't stand to watch it, it makes me cry too much!! Especially when Henry, at the very end, says. ""Goodbye, Jonathan."" and you KNOW he is going to die--so heartbreaking for a child!!",5,Great movie but...,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,2958,"['saw', 'Disney', 'channel', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'first', 'was', 'bothered', 'Jonathan', 'Huckleberry', 'Fox', '70', 'mullety', 'hairstyle', 'Was', 'boy', 'girl', 'fact', 'walked', 'middle', 'show', 'where', 'dressed', 'old-fashioned', 'clothes', 'must', 'have', 'added', 'confusion', 'gender', 'therefore', 'leading', 'initial', 'biased', 'opinion.But', 'was', 'eventually', 'drawn', 'grandfather', 'loved', 'airplanes', 'had', 'one', 'own', 'had', 'built', 'was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'sci-fi', 'person', 'find', 'thought', 'time', 'travel', 'very', 'bizarre', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'strange', 'really', 'quite', 'good.When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Disney', 'was', 'known', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'pilot', 'Max', 'Knickerbocker', 'biplane', 'However', 'later', 'revised', 'added', 'more', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'just', 'added', 'clips', 'cut', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'released', 'Disney', 'Sunday', 'Movie', 'known', 'Time', 'Flyer', 'liked', 'version', 'best', 'made', 'more', 'sense.Jonathan', 'back', 'time', 'meet', 'grandfather', 'Max', 'WAY', 'place', 'grandfather', 'world', 'including', '1980s', 'flamboyant', 'clothes', 'goon', 'should', 'know', 'time', 'course', 'just', 'ignorant', 'kid', 'funny', 'interesting', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'was', 'Time', 'Flyer', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'MacDonald', 'quarter', 'pounder', 'Apparently', 'MacDonald', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'quarter', 'pounders', 'days', 'maybe', 'MacDonald', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'fast', 'food', 'chain', 'apparently', 'remember', 'correctly', 'was', 'grocery', 'store', 'fast', 'food', 'chain', 'spelled', 'McDonalds', 'guess', 'back', '20', 'eventually', 'up', 'grandfather', 'Max', 'who', 'Jonathan', 'smallest', 'radio', 'world', 'gigantic', 'Jonathan', 'time', 'Jonathan', 'sure', 'away', 'ignorance', 'time', 'era', 'Max', 'Knickerbocker', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'male', 'version', 'had', 'set', 'out', 'flight', 'vanished', 'Jonathan', 'had', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'try', 'stop', 'making', 'fateful', 'flight.Sad', 'bittersweet', 'movie', 'Weird', 'thinking', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'meet', 'grandparents', 'who', 'died', 'were', 'born', 'see', 'grandmother', 'pregnant', 'own', 'father', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'grandmother', 'yes', 'having', 'boy', 'father', 'Fortunately', 'Max', 'finally', 'Max', 'who', 'thought', 'up', 'theory', 'time', 'travel', 'years', 'later', 'best', 'friend', 'Jonathan', 'neighbor', 'Henry', 'who', 'was', 'dying', 'heart', 'failure', 'end', 'movie', 'guess', 'had', 'built', 'time', 'machine', 'never', 'tried', 'out', 'Jonathan', 'step', 'up', 'plate.It', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watch', 'cry', 'too', 'much', 'Especially', 'when', 'Henry', 'very', 'end', 'Goodbye', 'Jonathan', 'KNOW', 'going', 'die', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'child']",The Blue Yonder (aka 'Time Flyer')

One can only hope they will since they are releasing several of the other movies now. Peter Coyote, Art Carney, and Huckleberry Fox all turn in wonderful performances. Henry played by Carney plays the part of Jonathan's, Fox, grandfather. He tells him stories of how his great grandfather, Coyote, tried to cross the Atlantic by plane before Lindbergh did it. Jonathan uses a time machine to go back and try to help his great grandfather succeed. A great movie for the whole family.

I still love the movie as much now as then. This is an Adventure/SciFi movie about a young boy (Huckleberry Fox) who goes back in time to try to save his grandfather who died while trying to become the first person to fly across the Atlantic. There are great performances by Peter Coyote (as the boy's father) and Art Carney (as a friend of the boy), but for me, what really made this a first rate production was the masterful direction of Mark Rosman and the incredibly believeable performance by the very adorable young Huckleberry Fox in what may possibly be his greatest role ever. This is a movie for anyone who needs encouragement to follow their dreams and believe in their own vision. This movie soars with adventure, and when you watch it your spirit will soar as well.
