1658375,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DL47XES,Paul Allaer,"[20, 23]","""Baggage Claim"" (2013 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Montana or 'Mo' (played by Paula Patton, a/k/a Mrs. Robin Thicke), a 29 yr. old single woman who has not found success or happiness in love. As the movie opens, we get to know Mo's mom, who (in a clever montage) we see getting married, and remarried and again and again (as Mo keeps grows up and becomes a woman). Then there is Mo's younger sister, a college student, who has just announced she's gotten engaged to be married in exactly 30 days. Mo is a flight attendant, and her coworkers decide to help and find ""the right guy"" for her by looking up the travel bookings made by Mo's former flames and 'accidentally' having Mo work on those flights. Before we know it, we see Mo flying around the country and creating chance-encounters with these ex-flames. Will Mo find the right guy in time for her sister's wedding in 30 days? To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the Paula Patton show from start to finish. She is in just about every single scene of the movie, and she radiates the screen with her charm and energy. If it wasn't for her, I doubt I'd even have bothered with this movie. We saw her just a few months ago in ""2 Guns"", and it seems she is ascending the ranks of leading Hollywood women rather quickly. Good for her. Second, the photography of this movie is a real eye-pleaser. Tons of gorgeous city skyline shots from the air throughout the movie (the movie is a true travel movie by air). Third, this movie does not break any new ground in, or stands apart from, many other recent rom-coms, and in that sense it is quite unremarkable, yet it is predictable as it is enjoyable. Fourth, there are a couple of truly hilarious scenes, the best one for me when Mo is on a date with an ex-flame who is a politician. They are joined by a wealthy older couple (featuring Ned Beatty). At one point the conversation turns what makes Tiger Woods ""black"", and whether he is ""black"" enough. Just watch!Speaking of which: As I went to see this in the theatre here in Cincinnati a few days ago, I had no idea that I, a middle aged white man, am not at all the target audience for this movie (it became clear quickly that the is a movie mostly featuring African-Americans and intended mostly for the African-American community). To be honest, it never bothered me in the least, and I enjoyed this movie for what it is: a rom-com that is as predictable as it is enjoyable, mainly due to Paula Patton.
