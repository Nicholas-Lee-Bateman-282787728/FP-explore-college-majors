1463696,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005K8RJ10,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[6, 7]","The film takes place in Detroit on the ironically named ""Joy Road."" At age 9 Tony Smalls (Wood Harris) is sent to a private school and becomes an attorney, although not overly successful. His sister Nia (N'Bushe Wright) dates a thug named Big Boy excellently portrayed by Christian Mathis. When Big Boy is accused of a baby killing, Nia begs Tony to defend him.Tony is torn between defending a thug and his wife's white bread world. Pressure is placed on Tony to take a plea bargain and of course Big Boy claims he is innocent. The trial becomes a show case for politics and money as a private prison organization is using this case to lobby for a 3 strikes law (I believe they actually did this in Arizona according to R. Maddow).There were several awkwardly written scenes which brought out some awkward moments for Wood Harris, who just didn't seem right for the role. Outside of the main character, the acting was acceptable, and at times gritty street good.F-bomb, n-word, gratuitous nudity.",4,I AM THE KEEPER OF THE FLAME,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,996,"['film', 'place', 'Detroit', 'ironically', 'named', 'Joy', 'Road', 'age', '9', 'Tony', 'Smalls', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'sent', 'private', 'school', 'attorney', 'not', 'overly', 'successful', 'sister', 'Nia', ""N'Bushe"", 'Wright', 'thug', 'named', 'Big', 'Boy', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'Christian', 'Mathis', 'When', 'Big', 'Boy', 'accused', 'baby', 'killing', 'Nia', 'Tony', 'defend', 'him.Tony', 'torn', 'defending', 'thug', 'wife', 'white', 'bread', 'world', 'Pressure', 'placed', 'Tony', 'take', 'plea', 'bargain', 'course', 'Big', 'Boy', 'innocent', 'trial', 'show', 'case', 'politics', 'money', 'private', 'prison', 'organization', 'using', 'case', 'lobby', '3', 'strikes', 'law', 'believe', 'actually', 'did', 'Arizona', 'according', 'R.', 'Maddow', 'were', 'several', 'awkwardly', 'written', 'scenes', 'brought', 'out', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'role', 'main', 'character', 'acting', 'was', 'acceptable', 'times', 'gritty', 'street', 'good.F-bomb', 'n-word', 'gratuitous', 'nudity']",Joy Road
