765159,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0000AOV3W,azindn,"[21, 24]","Close My Eyes is a mild and genteel examination of sibling incest amid the London yuppie set and against the backdrop of riverside redevelopment along the Thames. Natalie Gillespie (Saskia Reeves) is an unhappy woman of working class roots. We know this from a quick moving opening sequence of brief scenes that covers five years of her dissatisfied love relationships whining to her ambitious sexy brother, Richard, who she is distanced in age and personality. Richard Gillespie (Clive Owens), is a studly young architect, outgoing unlike his sullen sister, and able to successfully pursue his intellectual and creative pursuits. After a shared late night kiss, reality was quickly passed over as simply cuddling until Natalie rekindles her relationship with the long absent brother dearest.Again bored, and with a new husband, Sinclair Bryant (Alan Rickman), a financial wiz who is pompous, condescending of his wife, and wealthy from family money, Natalie and Richard cross the line of social taboos with a torrid sexual affair. Richard's distraction with his sister becomes obsession while she is simply using him for excitement against a vacuous social schedule with unsuspecting Sinclair. The danger of forbidden fruit and illegal sexual thrill drives the couple to meet under the nose of Natalie's cuckold husband. Inept Sinclair is faithful to his wife and his work routine. A chatterbox of politeness, Sinclair's privileged upbring, beautiful homes, and class distance him from Natalie's insecurities. To make up for her shortcomings, she manipulates the game through her little brother, whose confidence is eroding under the spell of his sister's vacillation and sexual control.Superior performances by Alan Rickman (Truly, Deeply, Madly; An Awfully Big Adventure) in easily one of his most sympathetic roles grounds the erotic performance of Clive Owen (Closer, Croupier), who is naked for extensive portions of the movie. They surround Saskia Reeve's performance with sufficient testosterone to overshadow the shortcomings of the secondary story line of Richard's boss who is dying of AIDS. Although meant to have social relevance, incest and AIDS seem an unlikely pairing.Perhaps it is the notion of the unspoken pariah status of its victims, or the rightness or wrongness of the sibling's actions that is never examined in depth which makes the film unsuccessful and somewhat dated. It is a weakness surrounding what motivates Natalie's disenchantment with her perfect situation, or why Richard is so drawn to his older sister that the audience is left to ponder. Unlike a Tennessee Williams story of forbidden excesses, Close My Eyes becomes an exercise in the boredom of river front living by a menage of shallow characters.",4,Sibling Lust Against the London Architectural Revival Dust,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2740,"['Close', 'My', 'Eyes', 'mild', 'genteel', 'examination', 'sibling', 'incest', 'London', 'yuppie', 'set', 'backdrop', 'riverside', 'redevelopment', 'Thames', 'Natalie', 'Gillespie', 'Saskia', 'Reeves', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'working', 'class', 'roots', 'know', 'quick', 'moving', 'opening', 'sequence', 'brief', 'scenes', 'five', 'years', 'dissatisfied', 'love', 'relationships', 'whining', 'ambitious', 'sexy', 'brother', 'Richard', 'who', 'distanced', 'age', 'personality', 'Richard', 'Gillespie', 'Clive', 'Owens', 'studly', 'young', 'architect', 'outgoing', 'sullen', 'sister', 'able', 'successfully', 'pursue', 'intellectual', 'creative', 'pursuits', 'shared', 'late', 'night', 'kiss', 'reality', 'was', 'quickly', 'passed', 'over', 'simply', 'cuddling', 'Natalie', 'relationship', 'long', 'absent', 'brother', 'dearest.Again', 'bored', 'new', 'husband', 'Sinclair', 'Bryant', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'financial', 'wiz', 'who', 'pompous', 'condescending', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'family', 'money', 'Natalie', 'Richard', 'cross', 'line', 'social', 'taboos', 'torrid', 'sexual', 'affair', 'Richard', 'distraction', 'sister', 'obsession', 'simply', 'using', 'excitement', 'vacuous', 'social', 'schedule', 'unsuspecting', 'Sinclair', 'danger', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'illegal', 'sexual', 'thrill', 'couple', 'meet', 'nose', 'Natalie', 'cuckold', 'husband', 'Inept', 'Sinclair', 'faithful', 'wife', 'work', 'routine', 'chatterbox', 'politeness', 'Sinclair', 'privileged', 'upbring', 'beautiful', 'homes', 'class', 'distance', 'Natalie', 'insecurities', 'make', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'game', 'little', 'brother', 'confidence', 'eroding', 'spell', 'sister', 'vacillation', 'sexual', 'control.Superior', 'performances', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Truly', 'Deeply', 'Madly', 'Awfully', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'roles', 'erotic', 'performance', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Closer', 'Croupier', 'who', 'naked', 'extensive', 'portions', 'movie', 'surround', 'Saskia', 'Reeve', 'performance', 'sufficient', 'testosterone', 'overshadow', 'shortcomings', 'secondary', 'story', 'line', 'Richard', 'boss', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'meant', 'have', 'social', 'relevance', 'incest', 'AIDS', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'pairing.Perhaps', 'notion', 'unspoken', 'pariah', 'status', 'victims', 'rightness', 'wrongness', 'sibling', 'actions', 'never', 'examined', 'depth', 'film', 'unsuccessful', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'weakness', 'surrounding', 'what', 'Natalie', 'disenchantment', 'perfect', 'situation', 'why', 'Richard', 'so', 'drawn', 'older', 'sister', 'audience', 'left', 'ponder', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'story', 'forbidden', 'excesses', 'Close', 'My', 'Eyes', 'exercise', 'boredom', 'river', 'front', 'living', 'menage', 'shallow', 'characters']",N/A

Nothing in their manner with each other or their physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related, nor does the characters' backstory as provided by the screenwriter give any credibility to their brother-sister relationship.  They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character flaws, because that's how the relationship came across.Outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull, slow moving and somewhat tawdry.  Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (reflecting her screen character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.)  The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen's AIDS-stricken boss.Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film:  he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously ill, and this very fact intimidates the guy he's gone to meet.  The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically.  It's a little whiplash of a scene that crackles with this intelligent character's anger & pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while a stupid, corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally.  If only the rest of this film had this kind of energy and decisiveness!But aside from that scene, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen's character was shouting his realization that he'd been used by his ""sister"" to inflate her sense of self-importance, during his final culmination scene, I was long gone, with my head nodding.Much ado about nothing, frankly.

But they can only do so much, because the real problem with this film is the script. For the first twenty minutes or so of screen time, the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented Natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother. (You *might* not pick up on that fact at first, since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike.) Finally the main part of the plot begins, with Natalie just as discontented, despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy (Alan Rickman, for whose sake I watched this film at all--not worth it), and with her brother seemingly happy with his life, but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister. From that point, things spiral--no, that's too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control, with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair, the poor brother (the only particularly sympathetic character in the film) becoming obsessed with the relationship, and the worried hubby's suspicions growing (although not in the right direction). There's so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling, but isn't, on any level. The plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation, scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet.
