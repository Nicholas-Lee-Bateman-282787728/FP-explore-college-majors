1433118,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B004YCKJ9C,Einsatz,"[14, 15]","""You thinking what I'm thinking?""""Probably not.""Russell Spivey, a police profiler (Mark Thompson) no sooner returns from psychiatric leave when he suddenly finds himself caught up in a serial killer's rampage.  Fighting to keep the trauma of his childhood buried, Russell Spivey must confront the trademark of the killer: all too-familiar masks left on the faces of his victims.  The significance of these masks is reveled slowly and late, this is mainly a story about a cop with issues (they always have issues, in this case drinking).  A great deal of time is devoted to Russell Spivey's issues, which also involves Kevin Pollack as the doctor who is treating him.  I was less interested in this aspect of the film but most of the amusing moments came from their interplay (""light?"").  So I'm conflicted, I really liked this movie but it's definitely more a procedural than what the DVD illustration suggests.  If you went by the impression the cover gives you would be misled into thinking this was a horror film, it's not.  Even though all the elements represented on the cover are accurate to the contents, they're done in such a way that you would think it was a horror movie.  I think that's a bit of a cheat.At any rate, I enjoyed it once I got over my initial disappointment.

The lead actor was fantastic. Every emotion he was feeling was showed in his eyes and demeanor. I am not sure if I had seen him in other things, he was superb in this. I think the comparison to Seven and Silence of the Lambs is wishful thinking, however, this is a very good film in its own right. The plot, although done before, is about a cop who comes back from leave (you will know why) only to be plunged into a nightmare investigation of a serial killer who likes William Shakespeare.

There are too many stereotyped characters, including the lead.  The dialogue is all cliches.It doesn't make sense, either.  How old are some of the characters supposed to be?  We see one of them in flashbacks taking place in the 1950s, where he looks like he's about 13 or 14 years old (and why does he have long hair in these flashbacks?  Boys did not wear their hair long at that time).  We also see footage of him in the 1960s when he's a young man.
