She can do comedy or drama and in this movie she does a little of both. The story has a little bit of everything in it and the romance between Rosanna and Eric Roberts is one of the highlights of it. The two actors have tons of chemistry and you root for them throughout the movie.

Rosanna plays a girl with a broken heart.  Worse she is a town outcast; those in town think she is a bit of a lunatic for having attacked her jerk boyfriend with a fork.  She enrolls in a theater workshop and slowly becomes involved with Eric Roberts, who is a bit of a misfit himself.  Along the way are a lot of true moments, sublime little touches and some wonderful humor.&#34;To Be or Not to Be is Not Much of a Choice,&#34; is the town's motto.  Funny throwaway bit but apropos for the riddle of existence these two lovebirds have to solve.  And solve it they do.  It's a wonderful comedy.

861868,AD5505PRB0IDO,B00066VTWG,Randall,"[3, 3]","Outstanding screenplay, direction, acting, and musical score. I have watched this film several times, it is an amazing feel good romantic drama/comedy (more drama than comedy, but very quirky and funny in many spots). Rosanna Arquette shines in this film as our hero seeking love, and escape from her small hometown, perhaps more importantly her character seeks to find her inner self. I wish they would have released a soundtrack CD for this film, or perhaps now they could at least distribute it as download as digital music (hoping). I give this film five stars as a romance drama-comedy, but of course it is drama, and independent film, so do not expect huge budget special effects. The film is shot in the New Mexico/Arizona region, with some nice backdrops.  Note: The Amazon description of the DVD here says it is 1.33:1 (4:3 TV mode), but I already purchased two copies and the DVD includes both 1.33:1 as well as widescreen mode (which I have viewed off the DVD).",5,Outstanding  !,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,972,"['Outstanding', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'acting', 'musical', 'score', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'amazing', 'feel', 'good', 'romantic', 'drama/comedy', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'very', 'quirky', 'funny', 'many', 'spots', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'shines', 'film', 'hero', 'seeking', 'love', 'escape', 'small', 'hometown', 'perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'character', 'seeks', 'find', 'inner', 'self', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'released', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'film', 'perhaps', 'now', 'could', 'least', 'distribute', 'as', 'download', 'digital', 'music', 'hoping', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'romance', 'drama-comedy', 'course', 'drama', 'independent', 'film', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'huge', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'shot', 'New', 'Mexico/Arizona', 'region', 'nice', 'backdrops', 'Note', 'Amazon', 'description', 'DVD', 'here', '1.33:1', '4:3', 'TV', 'mode', 'already', 'purchased', 'two', 'copies', 'DVD', '1.33:1', 'as', 'well', 'widescreen', 'mode', 'have', 'viewed', 'off', 'DVD']",N/A
