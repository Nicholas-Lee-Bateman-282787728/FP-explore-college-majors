I'm not a huge country fan or Shania Fan, but I enjoy some of her songs and decided to give it a try. I was also influenced because I own the Elvis 68 concert, which I enjoy.This performance isn't as powerful as the Elvis 68 concert, but it stands strong on it's own. The songs are very good and I enjoyed the addition of Union Station and Allison Krauss (they sounded phenomenal together). Shania sang every song with perfection and my opinion of her talent and self is much higher after seeing this.DVD QUALITY: I wasn't sure how the quality would be because the DVD cover looked a bit cheaply printed. However, the DVD quality was better then expected (great sound and picture). The bonuses are all strung together in a montage (which I didn't like).

857823,A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B00063F7OK,"K. J. Bryant ""peachycream""","[3, 8]","Shania's attempts to cash in on bluegrass and to try and raise her status as a ""serious"" artist backfired on this concert. Its now clear to me why her songs are over-produced because without it her songs will be nothing. It appears to me, her husband knows he has to masked her voice with other sounds and production tricks because simply singing against simple instruments will not work for Shania. I think the songs would flow better if Shania wrote more serious songs...who wants to hear a song like 'In My Car' in an intimate manner? Songs like that are meant to have a fun sound, so most of the material for this concert should have come from her ""The Woman In Me"" album.IMO, Shania sounds dull and flat on this DVD. She sounds like someone is holding her nose while she is singing and this is very clear when you hear her TRY and sing AC/DC classic ""Shook Me All Night Long"". I guess Shania wanted to pay tribute to her husband who produced the classic 80s song for the band but Shania's vocals are VERY limited and that song actually exposed her. Another thing about his performance is she seems a little bored (lacks any spark) in her performance, even though she talked a bit about the songs during her show.The saving grace on this DVD is Alison Krauss who naturally has an appealing and warm voice. The arrangement of the music by Union Station is wonderfully done that there is no need for a singer. I respect the fact that Shania is sharing the spotlight with AK and US, but they actually made Shania performance without taking the show away from her.I don't think this DVD did what Shania wanted it to do for her (show her a serious artist and as a real country artist). By that time, it became clear to all she has lost alot of country fans and her most of her pop fans didn't clamor for her new materials either. You can't recycle materials and then expect people to support you. This DVD is not that popular outside of Shania die-hard fans and there are many reasons why. Someone wrote this DVD will be a proud moment for Shania...I think most people will forget this performance...its not significant.",2,Only For Die Hard Fans,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,2119,"['Shania', 'attempts', 'cash', 'bluegrass', 'try', 'raise', 'status', 'serious', 'artist', 'backfired', 'concert', 'now', 'clear', 'why', 'songs', 'are', 'over-produced', 'songs', 'will', 'be', 'nothing', 'husband', 'masked', 'voice', 'other', 'sounds', 'production', 'tricks', 'simply', 'singing', 'simple', 'instruments', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'Shania', 'think', 'songs', 'would', 'flow', 'better', 'Shania', 'wrote', 'more', 'serious', 'songs', 'who', 'hear', 'song', 'My', 'Car', 'intimate', 'manner', 'Songs', 'are', 'meant', 'have', 'fun', 'sound', 'most', 'material', 'concert', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'Woman', 'Me', 'album.IMO', 'Shania', 'dull', 'flat', 'DVD', 'someone', 'holding', 'nose', 'singing', 'very', 'clear', 'when', 'hear', 'TRY', 'sing', 'AC/DC', 'classic', 'Shook', 'Me', 'All', 'Night', 'Long', 'guess', 'Shania', 'wanted', 'pay', 'tribute', 'husband', 'who', 'produced', 'classic', '80s', 'song', 'band', 'Shania', 'vocals', 'are', 'VERY', 'limited', 'song', 'actually', 'exposed', 'thing', 'performance', 'little', 'bored', 'spark', 'performance', 'even', 'talked', 'bit', 'songs', 'show.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'DVD', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'who', 'naturally', 'appealing', 'warm', 'voice', 'arrangement', 'music', 'Union', 'Station', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'need', 'singer', 'respect', 'fact', 'Shania', 'sharing', 'spotlight', 'AK', 'US', 'actually', 'made', 'Shania', 'performance', 'taking', 'show', 'away', 'her.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'did', 'what', 'Shania', 'wanted', 'do', 'show', 'serious', 'artist', 'real', 'country', 'artist', 'time', 'became', 'clear', 'lost', 'alot', 'country', 'fans', 'most', 'pop', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'clamor', 'new', 'materials', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recycle', 'materials', 'then', 'expect', 'people', 'support', 'DVD', 'not', 'popular', 'Shania', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'Someone', 'wrote', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'proud', 'moment', 'Shania', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'forget', 'performance', 'not', 'significant']",N/A
