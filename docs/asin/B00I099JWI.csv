The budget seemed toe much less then a Godzilla flick, but what was great was that this Kaiju could expend energy to jet propel himself wherever he wanted to go. He debut film was kind of lacking in imagination, using the old atom bomb triggers monsters release plot, but overall it was great. The way they the Japanese scientists dealt with his rampage was very cool ted  they make the actor and scene sound. Its much nicer to hear them speak their native Japan, and the subs are well synched with the dialogue.The BD in my opinion was of a very acceptable quality considering they put it all on one BD, I didn't see any lines or scratches ini the films  so if you are an avid Gamer fan, you can be sure your get your moneys worth for the pittance you pay.CONS: While Godzilla had his great and not so great moments such as when he became a kids lovable dinosaur for a few years before being retrofitted with new costume that was more flattering in terms of bringing him back to the ominous and dangerous whirlwind of destruction that he was in hs debut film..  In contrast Gamera right away out of the blue became know as the friend of children, which meant that he was a nice turtle who fought off some conceptually interesting creatures that looked awful due not doubt to the budget for the Gamera films.The Soundtrack was alway the same, the Gamera march theme often with the Japanese boys scouts singing the lyrics. From his second movie onward you can only stare dumbfounded and wonder whose bright it idea it was to take an actually cool Kaiju and make  him into no more then a joke.Also what was grating was the fact that they tended to give flashbacks to the monster hs had fought in the past over and over film after film we had to see scenes we had seen a million times before as if to pad the running time.So I gave it 2 stars. 1 for Gamera the first Kaiju Jet Setter (literally), whose promising debut quickly degenerated in to only 12 completely childish movies, the last one appearing  in 2006. Was this the studios intent? It was an idiotic move. But Gamera has a place in my heart.1. Star for the quality of the BD at least I finally got to see it Gameras movies in all their original Japanese glory without the aggravating dubbing of the English only releases, which usually never truly conveys the actors emotions and mood as does his real voice.",2,"Literally for your inner child, otherwise avoid.",1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,2546,"['Consider', 'opinion', 'Vol', '1', '2', 'Gamera', 'Colleciton.PROS', 'kid', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Gamera', 'debut', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'ice', 'terrorize', 'Japan', 'budget', 'seemed', 'toe', 'much', 'less', 'then', 'Godzilla', 'flick', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Kaiju', 'could', 'expend', 'energy', 'jet', 'propel', 'wanted', 'go', 'debut', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'lacking', 'imagination', 'using', 'old', 'atom', 'bomb', 'monsters', 'release', 'plot', 'overall', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'Japanese', 'scientists', 'dealt', 'rampage', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'ted', 'make', 'actor', 'scene', 'sound', 'much', 'nicer', 'hear', 'speak', 'native', 'Japan', 'subs', 'are', 'well', 'synched', 'dialogue.The', 'BD', 'opinion', 'was', 'very', 'acceptable', 'quality', 'considering', 'put', 'one', 'BD', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'lines', 'scratches', 'ini', 'films', 'so', 'are', 'avid', 'Gamer', 'fan', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'moneys', 'pittance', 'pay.CONS', 'Godzilla', 'had', 'great', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'became', 'kids', 'lovable', 'dinosaur', 'few', 'years', 'being', 'retrofitted', 'new', 'costume', 'was', 'more', 'flattering', 'terms', 'bringing', 'back', 'ominous', 'dangerous', 'whirlwind', 'destruction', 'was', 'hs', 'debut', 'film..', 'contrast', 'Gamera', 'right', 'away', 'blue', 'became', 'know', 'friend', 'children', 'meant', 'was', 'nice', 'turtle', 'who', 'fought', 'off', 'conceptually', 'interesting', 'creatures', 'looked', 'awful', 'due', 'not', 'doubt', 'budget', 'Gamera', 'films.The', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'alway', 'same', 'Gamera', 'march', 'theme', 'often', 'Japanese', 'boys', 'scouts', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'second', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'stare', 'dumbfounded', 'wonder', 'bright', 'idea', 'was', 'take', 'actually', 'cool', 'Kaiju', 'make', 'more', 'then', 'joke.Also', 'what', 'was', 'grating', 'was', 'fact', 'tended', 'give', 'flashbacks', 'monster', 'hs', 'had', 'fought', 'past', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'see', 'scenes', 'had', 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'pad', 'running', 'time.So', 'gave', '2', 'stars', '1', 'Gamera', 'first', 'Kaiju', 'Jet', 'Setter', 'literally', 'promising', 'debut', 'quickly', 'degenerated', 'only', '12', 'completely', 'childish', 'movies', 'last', 'one', 'appearing', '2006', 'Was', 'studios', 'intent', 'was', 'idiotic', 'move', 'Gamera', 'place', 'heart.1', 'Star', 'quality', 'BD', 'least', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'Gameras', 'movies', 'original', 'Japanese', 'glory', 'aggravating', 'dubbing', 'English', 'only', 'usually', 'never', 'truly', 'actors', 'emotions', 'mood', 'real', 'voice']",Gamera: Ultimate Collection - Volume 1

His second, and last adult adventure (first in color) had him battle Barugon, a vicious creature that shot fire and had a rainbow energy barrier. After this brutal encounter, Gamera was firmly on the side of humanity and children, defending earth from the vicious beasties that constantly came here to cause problems.

The question is whether the Blu-ray is worth your time or money. It was for me. I thought the prints looked pretty good and it's the first four movies on one disc for a low price. The first four are considered better than the ladder four. My favorite is Gamera vs Gyaos. It's the one I saw the most as a child. Even though my childhood memories were in English, I always play them in Japanese. They just seem less fake. But I can see the charm in the English dubs.  As mentioned in other reviews, there are no extras and no choice of audio. It's Japanese with English subtitles. I do have the previous release of these movies and was happy with them too. If you don't have any of these movies and you don't mind reading subtitles, you can get all eight movies of the original series for pretty cheap.",5,Gamera-rays,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,910,"['Chances', 'are', 'looking', 'item', 'not', 'new', 'movies', 'series', 'almost', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'question', 'Blu-ray', 'time', 'money', 'was', 'thought', 'prints', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'first', 'four', 'movies', 'one', 'disc', 'low', 'price', 'first', 'four', 'are', 'considered', 'better', 'ladder', 'four', 'favorite', 'Gamera', 'vs', 'Gyaos', 'one', 'saw', 'most', 'child', 'Even', 'childhood', 'memories', 'were', 'English', 'always', 'play', 'Japanese', 'just', 'seem', 'less', 'fake', 'can', 'see', 'charm', 'English', 'dubs', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'extras', 'choice', 'audio', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'do', 'have', 'previous', 'release', 'movies', 'was', 'happy', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'can', 'get', 'eight', 'movies', 'original', 'series', 'pretty', 'cheap']",Gamera: Ultimate Collection - Volume 1

I found you could deminish the &#34;lines&#34; on the screen by watching in &#34;cinema&#34; mode, but that's really not the point. They shouldn't be there. And to top it off at 0:04-22 when an unknown bomber explodes there's a frame that's completely pixelated. It's a very poor job. I checked it on two bluray players and the computer and got the same pixelated frame each time. So I went to slow-mo and there it was. Ok, it's only one frame, but it should not have happened. The other 3 films are in colour and &#34;OK&#34; for the most part although &#34;Gamera vs. Barugon&#34; has an odd &#34;jump&#34; at 0:09-07.
