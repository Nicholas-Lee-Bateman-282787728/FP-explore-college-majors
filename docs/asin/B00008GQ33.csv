742251,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B00008GQ33,A. Boston,"[7, 7]","I love this show, hands down, in my top 5. I saw the entire series when it originally aired on tv when I was in college, and this is one of the few I would consider re-watching, so I had to own it. I think the 1st and 3rd season are my favorite, but on the whole you should see them all. This isn't just a show for the ladies either. I'll have marathons when I'm sick, or just taking a 'couch day' and without fail, my boyfriend will show up... he might start out pretending to read a book, but next thing you know, he's asking me questions and watching it with me.I did notice the songs were different from the original, and I'm huge music buff. But honestly, besides noticing it, it didn't actually bother me. The plot is the stand out star, not the music. It might change the mood of certain scenes slightly, but if you never saw them on tv, you'd never know.As I've said before, I'm a huge sucker for love triangles. But, only ones that are done well, not gooey and cheesy. You will forever be torn between Ben and Noel....you may find yourself shouting out your choice(for me, I shout BEN!) trying to sway Felicity one way or the other. The 2nd season she starts to branch out and date other people, which is maybe why it's not my favorite season. But despite that, its still awesome. It's the season of the haircut!! Felicity starts to come into her own, establish herself in NYC and find out who her friends are. Not only that, but does she really want to be a doctor? You'll see her trying to figure out what she really wants to do with her life, and break away from her dependency(crush) on Ben.Javier does comes back(YAY!), he gives you that ray of sunshine, with his happy disposition, and definitely stands out with a great dose of comedy. All the characters were cast extremely well, and you'll definitely have your personal favorites.Timeless, excellent show.

Now I can enjoy these well-writtten, wonderfully acted episodes whenever I want. Keri Russel's title character cut her gorgeous locks that season and the rating took a nose dive but I found this season the most fun and heartwarming. Felicity starts to date her high school crush, Ben but they break up because of his unwillingness to commit but by the end of the season, Ben realizes Felicity is the one who got away. My favorite episodes include: Crash, The Love Bug, Help for the Lovelorn, Ben Was Here, The Aretha Factor, and The Biggest Deal There Is.  I love and miss this show so much. J.J.

Premiering on the WB network in September 1998, the show (along with Dawson's Creek) helped ignite a firestorm of highly successful original series on behalf of the upstart network, with such hit shows as Angel (1999), Gilmore Girls (2000), and Smallville (2001). The brainchild of writer J.J. Abrams (creator of the two hit series Alias and Lost), Felicity follows the life of a recent high school graduate, not through seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, but through Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Similar in genre to its contemporary, Dawson's Creek, Felicity's cast is of approximately the same age, but the setting is college instead of high school...Felicity begins when the star of the series, Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), graduates from high school. Having harbored a four-year crush on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), despite the fact they've never talked, Felicity musters the courage in the aftermath of their commencement ceremony to ask him to sign her yearbook. When Ben writes some surprising comments, Felicity decides to follow him to fictional University of New York (UNY) instead of pursuing her goal of pre-med at Stanford. Against her parent's wishes, she enrolls in the school and moves cross country where she becomes roommates with Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), a girl whose lifestyle clashes with her own, and where she meets resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley) who immediately develops a crush on her. When Ben learns of the true reason for Felicity's enrollment, he's both flattered and a little uncertain about Felicity's mental stability. In the ensuing four years, Felicity goes through the basic trials and travails of a maturing college student, experiencing the ups and downs of life, love, and adulthood...The Felicity (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Sophomoric"" in which Felicity returns to UNY to discover that one of the dorms has been shut down and the college suffers from a housing shortage. As such, she must share her room and resident advisor duties with Meghan. Meanwhile, Julie and Noel are angry over the relationship between Ben and Felicity, and the housing shortage forces Julie to move in with Ben and Sean. Ben assures Felicity that he is over Julie, but he's uncertain of the future when he overhears Felicity say she might be in love with him... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Portraits"" in which Felicity and Noel consider rekindling their relationship while working together on an art assignment, and ""Running Mates"" in which a dirty campaign for the campus student government association drives a wedge between Ben and Felicity...Below is a list of episodes included on the Felicity (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (Sophomoric)Episode 24 (The List)Episode 25 (Ancient History)Episode 26 (The Depths)Episode 27 (Crash)Episode 28 (The Love Bug)Episode 29 (Getting Lucky)Episode 30 (Family Affairs)Episode 31 (Portraits)Episode 32 (Great Expectations)Episode 33 (Help for the Lovelorn)Episode 34 (The Slump)Episode 35 (Truth or Consequences)Episode 36 (True Colors)Episode 37 (Things Change)Episode 38 (Revolutions)Episode 39 (Docuventary II)Episode 40 (Party Lines)Episode 41 (Running Mates)Episode 42 (Ben Was Here)Episode 43 (The Aretha Theory)Episode 44 (Final Answer)Episode 45 (The Biggest Deal There Is)The DVD Report",5,Sophomore year...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3515,"['Nominated', '2', 'Emmys', '2', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'TV', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Felicity', 'gathered', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'short', 'four', 'season', 'stint', 'Premiering', 'WB', 'network', 'September', '1998', 'show', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'helped', 'ignite', 'firestorm', 'highly', 'successful', 'original', 'series', 'behalf', 'upstart', 'network', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Angel', '1999', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', '2000', 'Smallville', '2001', 'brainchild', 'writer', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'two', 'hit', 'series', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'Felicity', 'life', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'not', 'seasons', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior', 'years', 'Similar', 'genre', 'contemporary', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Felicity', 'cast', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'setting', 'college', 'instead', 'high', 'school', 'Felicity', 'when', 'star', 'series', 'Felicity', 'Porter', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'high', 'school', 'Having', 'harbored', 'four-year', 'crush', 'classmate', 'Ben', 'Covington', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'talked', 'Felicity', 'courage', 'aftermath', 'commencement', 'ceremony', 'ask', 'sign', 'yearbook', 'When', 'Ben', 'surprising', 'comments', 'Felicity', 'follow', 'fictional', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'UNY', 'instead', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'pre-med', 'Stanford', 'parent', 'wishes', 'school', 'moves', 'cross', 'country', 'where', 'roommates', 'Meghan', 'Rotundi', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'girl', 'lifestyle', 'clashes', 'own', 'where', 'resident', 'advisor', 'Noel', 'Crane', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'who', 'immediately', 'crush', 'When', 'Ben', 'true', 'reason', 'Felicity', 'enrollment', 'flattered', 'little', 'uncertain', 'Felicity', 'mental', 'stability', 'ensuing', 'four', 'years', 'Felicity', 'basic', 'trials', 'travails', 'maturing', 'college', 'student', 'experiencing', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'love', 'adulthood', 'Felicity', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Sophomoric', 'Felicity', 'UNY', 'discover', 'one', 'dorms', 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'college', 'suffers', 'housing', 'shortage', 'such', 'must', 'share', 'room', 'resident', 'advisor', 'duties', 'Meghan', 'Meanwhile', 'Julie', 'Noel', 'are', 'angry', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'housing', 'shortage', 'forces', 'Julie', 'move', 'Ben', 'Sean', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'Julie', 'uncertain', 'future', 'when', 'Felicity', 'say', 'might', 'be', 'love', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Portraits', 'Felicity', 'Noel', 'consider', 'rekindling', 'relationship', 'working', 'together', 'art', 'assignment', 'Running', 'Mates', 'dirty', 'campaign', 'campus', 'student', 'government', 'association', 'wedge', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Felicity', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Sophomoric', 'Episode', '24', 'List', 'Episode', '25', 'Ancient', 'History', 'Episode', '26', 'Depths', 'Episode', '27', 'Crash', 'Episode', '28', 'Love', 'Bug', 'Episode', '29', 'Getting', 'Lucky', 'Episode', '30', 'Family', 'Affairs', 'Episode', '31', 'Portraits', 'Episode', '32', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Episode', '33', 'Help', 'Lovelorn', 'Episode', '34', 'Slump', 'Episode', '35', 'Truth', 'Consequences', 'Episode', '36', 'True', 'Colors', 'Episode', '37', 'Things', 'Change', 'Episode', '38', 'Revolutions', 'Episode', '39', 'Docuventary', 'II', 'Episode', '40', 'Party', 'Lines', 'Episode', '41', 'Running', 'Mates', 'Episode', '42', 'Ben', 'Was', 'Here', 'Episode', '43', 'Aretha', 'Theory', 'Episode', '44', 'Final', 'Answer', 'Episode', '45', 'Biggest', 'Deal', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

742256,A3CT2I82NPANNS,B00008GQ33,Desiree Troy,"[1, 1]","The very first time that I watched the pilot episode for Felicity on the season one DVD collection, I knew that I was going to fall completely in love with the impulsive Felicity who not only followed Ben three thousand miles across the country so that she could attend the same college as him, but ends up taking a drastic step in season two when she has all of her hair cut off when her relationship with him does not work out. In addition to this, in season two, she abruptly drops all of her pre-med courses to follow her dream of taking art classes. Felicity's impulsiveness made me fall for her, and the show, but it was her audio tape letters to Sally (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), her streams of consciousness and her unintentional ability to draw people to her that made me stay so interested with the show, and her character. It would have been virtually impossible for me not to have been drawn in by her and in season two after watching Felicity get involved in a few relationships that do not work out for one reason or another, and maturing as a human being I am very glad that I was willing to give this show a chance because her character is so inspiring and entertaining. The episodes that most captured my attention that concerned her character were ""Great Expectations"" when Felicity learns that her parents are separated, ""Help for the Lovelorn"" which was told in a format similar to that of The Twilight Zone, and  ""Revolutions"" when Felicity organises a sit-in at a health clinic for the university when she discovers that they are no longer giving out the morning after pill.Although Ben and Noel will always be two of my favourite characters on the show, I felt that their roles were branching off from how they were introduced in the first season. Normally, I would approve of this because it shows change and further character development but after a while, Ben's running away from Felicity and his relationship with Maggie just caused the show to deteriorate a bit. Noel's character spent much of the season with one of Felicity's advisees, Ruby (played by Amy Smart), who ends up pregnant but not with Noel's baby. I was impressed with Scott Foley's acting (he plays Noel) because it had to be difficult to reach the emotional level that was needed to play his role in this season but I was disappointed in his storyline.I was interested in Julie's rare appearances on the show. For some reason, she was pushed into the background, only resurfacing for a few episodes in which she had an opportunity to get a record deal and the episodes closer to the end of the season when Sean confronts her about his feelings for her and when Carol Anderson (Julie's birth mother played by Jane Kaczmarek). Whenever she is given an actual storyline and is in an episode longer than ten seconds, she is still as incredible of an actress as always.Despite being disappointed in a majority of the episodes due to Noel and Julie's absences, I thought very highly of this season. The episode scripts were as well-written and interesting as they were in season one. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has not yet seen it. It's a fantastic show with an incredible, talented cast and showcases a realistic depiction of college life.",4,"A fantastic show with an incredible, talented cast",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3247,"['very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Felicity', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'collection', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'fall', 'completely', 'love', 'impulsive', 'Felicity', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'followed', 'Ben', 'three', 'thousand', 'miles', 'country', 'could', 'attend', 'same', 'college', 'up', 'taking', 'drastic', 'step', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'hair', 'cut', 'off', 'when', 'relationship', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'addition', 'season', 'two', 'abruptly', 'pre-med', 'courses', 'follow', 'dream', 'taking', 'art', 'classes', 'Felicity', 'impulsiveness', 'made', 'fall', 'show', 'was', 'audio', 'tape', 'letters', 'Sally', 'voiced', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'streams', 'consciousness', 'unintentional', 'ability', 'draw', 'people', 'made', 'stay', 'so', 'interested', 'show', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'season', 'two', 'watching', 'Felicity', 'get', 'involved', 'few', 'relationships', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'reason', 'maturing', 'human', 'being', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'character', 'so', 'inspiring', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'most', 'captured', 'attention', 'concerned', 'character', 'were', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'when', 'Felicity', 'parents', 'are', 'separated', 'Help', 'Lovelorn', 'was', 'told', 'format', 'similar', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Revolutions', 'when', 'Felicity', 'sit-in', 'health', 'clinic', 'university', 'when', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'giving', 'out', 'morning', 'pill.Although', 'Ben', 'Noel', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'two', 'favourite', 'characters', 'show', 'felt', 'roles', 'were', 'branching', 'off', 'how', 'were', 'introduced', 'first', 'season', 'Normally', 'would', 'approve', 'change', 'further', 'character', 'development', 'while', 'Ben', 'running', 'away', 'Felicity', 'relationship', 'Maggie', 'just', 'caused', 'show', 'deteriorate', 'bit', 'Noel', 'character', 'spent', 'much', 'season', 'one', 'Felicity', 'advisees', 'Ruby', 'played', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'up', 'pregnant', 'not', 'Noel', 'baby', 'was', 'impressed', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'acting', 'Noel', 'had', 'be', 'difficult', 'reach', 'emotional', 'level', 'was', 'needed', 'play', 'role', 'season', 'was', 'disappointed', 'storyline.I', 'was', 'interested', 'Julie', 'rare', 'appearances', 'show', 'reason', 'was', 'pushed', 'background', 'only', 'resurfacing', 'few', 'episodes', 'had', 'opportunity', 'get', 'record', 'deal', 'episodes', 'closer', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'Sean', 'confronts', 'feelings', 'when', 'Carol', 'Anderson', 'Julie', 'birth', 'mother', 'played', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'Whenever', 'given', 'actual', 'storyline', 'episode', 'longer', 'ten', 'seconds', 'still', 'incredible', 'actress', 'always.Despite', 'being', 'disappointed', 'majority', 'episodes', 'due', 'Noel', 'Julie', 'absences', 'thought', 'very', 'highly', 'season', 'episode', 'scripts', 'were', 'well-written', 'interesting', 'were', 'season', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'fantastic', 'show', 'incredible', 'talented', 'cast', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'college', 'life']",N/A

The Third and Fourth Seasons were the show straying from it's patented college realsim and evolving slowly into another corny and mundane Dawsons-Creek-like show.But in the ""Sophomore Year"" collection, everything came together.  The characters are wonderfully developed, their growth is believable, and their struggles are very poignant. This was the infamous season when Felicity cut her hair, and it also includes things (not to give too much away) such as student body elections and bar fights. In addition, the cinematography and lighting of this season are particularly beautiful and better than any of the other seasons.  The backing soundtrack is great as well, using a lot of melodic acoustic tunes to capture the drama and essence of the series.",5,The Best Season.,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,887,"['Second', 'Season', 'Felicity', 'was', 'strongest', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'show', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'wanted', 'be', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Seasons', 'were', 'show', 'straying', 'patented', 'college', 'realsim', 'evolving', 'slowly', 'corny', 'mundane', 'Dawsons-Creek-like', 'show.But', 'Sophomore', 'Year', 'collection', 'everything', 'came', 'together', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'growth', 'believable', 'struggles', 'are', 'very', 'poignant', 'was', 'infamous', 'season', 'when', 'Felicity', 'cut', 'hair', 'also', 'things', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'such', 'student', 'body', 'elections', 'bar', 'fights', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'season', 'are', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'better', 'other', 'seasons', 'backing', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'lot', 'melodic', 'acoustic', 'tunes', 'capture', 'drama', 'essence', 'series']",N/A

Martin ""ffej26""","[7, 8]","The second season of Felicity was certainly a step down from the spectacular season 1, but it does continue to excel in writing and acting. Probably one of the most underated televiosion series in hisroty, Felicity will always be one the most honest look at life and love in college. This season continues the whole Ben/Noel triangle, but it's alot more involved. We see Noel fall for a beautiful college freshan Ruby who gets in the way of Felicity and Noel. Felicity meets Greg, the student volunteer at the health clinic. Elena meets Tracy, and Julie basiclaly is thrown to the wayside for most of the season, but does have a few shing moments early on in the season.There are quite a few strong episodes in this season, such as &quot;The Depths&quot; in which Felicity and Julie get stuck on a subway for hrs. An intense episode with excellent pereformances from the 2 ladies. &quot;Family Affairs&quot; is a classic episode when everyone gets together for Thanksgiving, and theres an exciting moment at the end of the episode that will change the rest of the season. &quot;Help for the Lovelorn&quot; is the twilight zone episode and it's entirely in black and white, and it has a hysterical twist at the end and we finally get to know what is in Megeans box. Those are the top eps, but it also contains alot more.A few epsidos drag, and thats when the series takes a break from its relationship drama and focuses more on college life such as the boring episodes &quot;Revolutions&quot; when Felicity organizes a sit in for the morning after pills, and the whole Felicity/Greg running for Student Council President storyline could have been left out.Acting is as always top notch from the lovely Keri Russell who manages to carry each and every episode like a pro. She truly is a remarkable young actress. All the actors continue to do a great job and it's great to have the hysterical Ian Gomez as Javier as a cast regular, as well as Megean, Felicitys scary, witchy, roomate.

742269,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B00008GQ33,M. Leister,"[5, 6]","Yes, Felicity got a fugly haircut this season, but that's not why ratings took a nosedive.  First of all, the show changed nights - always the kiss of death on TV since it breaks a habit and could have put it in competition with something else you watch.  Remember these were the pre-DVR days so your TV didn't automatically record anything it thought you might like to watch.  You had to program your VCR to the right day and time and it might already be taping something else for you.Second, the show suffered some major plot catastrophes this season that most people don't talk about.  The driving force behind season one was the love triangle, sometimes square, between Felicity, Ben, Noel and Julie.  Felicity stalked Ben to NYC based on something he put in her yearbook and befriended Julie who Ben took a romantic interest in causing tension between the girls.  Felicity also caught the eye of Noel who tried to make her forget her unrequited crush on Ben.  Season one ended with a question of who Felicity spent the summer with Ben or Noel.  Season two took the entire first episode to tell you that Felicity went with Ben, something that those who paid attention knew from the previews because Felicity had on the necklace Ben gave her in season one in every shot.  So basically they dragged out the ""reveal"" until people lost interest.  Not a good start to the season.The triangle derailed here because Noel was never given a shot at Felicity again and her relationship with Ben didn't last long.  They broke up and she dated random guys no one cared about until she got back with Ben in a later season.  Things started to look brighter when a Noel/Julie revenge pairing was hinted at that might have reheated the love square, but Amy Jo Johnson's abrupt departure put the kibosh on that.  Noel never forgave Felicity for picking Ben and the triangle that drew so many in evaporated.The season's third big issue was the loss of Julie when Amy Jo Johnson left.  Julie was the second female lead IMO.  She had big stories playing out both with her budding relationship with Noel, anger at Felicity over Ben and meeting her biological parents.  In fact, she just had the bombshell dropped on her that bio mom was only coming around to get an organ donation for her hubby (Julie's bio dad) who had no idea Julie existed and bio mom wanted to keep it that way.  I for one was dying to see if Julie would tell her where to go or help in hopes of meeting the dad one day.  I also wanted to see where the thing with Noel went.  But all that was inexplicably dropped.  The show came back after its winter hiatus and Julie was gone.  They did one clip of a video Julie sent to her friends at school explaining her vanishing act that tried to sum it all up, but it was a letdown.At the time no real explanation was given for Amy Jo Johnson's departure, later they said a family member died, so I didn't know if she quit, was fired, or was on a leave to have a baby and might be back by the season finale.  I have to say, she was what I missed for the rest of the show's run, not Keri Russell's curly hair.  It was like the writers didn't know how to continue the main love story without Julie as angst and didn't know what stories to finish the season with w/o Julie's bio family story.  If they could recast Darren on Bewitched, I think a new Julie might have helped if losing her caused them to stumble so badly.  Or, and this may seem harsh, but they could have used this to deal with suicide.  It would have been a perfect fit for Julie's life at the time.  After all, her character who had been a party girl, was date raped, lost her boyfriend to her friend, was blatantly used by her bio mom and at was odds with her adoptive parents.  They even did an ep where everyone worried where she was.  Instead of Julie going home, why not have her be dead?  It would have kept fans from waiting for her to return to start up with Noel or Ben and it would have had great emotional impact both for characters and fans.  There would have been more closure and we might have gotten to see someone tear into her birth mom at the funeral for being such a selfish witch.Trying to win back viewers, they went with stunts like a new British roommate for the girls and her stalker boyfriend who turned up at a party with a gun.  Yawn.  Notice I can tell you more what happened before Julie left than after that's how forgettable it all was.The fourth issue, lesser than all the above, but still contributing to the show's problems was that they took them out of the dorms.  Noel as straight man RA to the chaos of the younger students provided laughs.  But in his anger at Felicity, he left the dorms.  They tried making Felicity an RA, but it wasn't the same since she needed counseling more than she was capable of giving it.  They then went into overuse of her roommate Megan, fine in small doses, but putting her on too much led to a mellowing of her character.  Ben was always in an apartment, but he too wound up with roommate overuse.  Carl Lumberg's character, the roommate, was funny in small bits, but got annoying being on so much.  By the end of the season, all the guys lived together and all the girls lived together in apartments which took them out of college life and away from bit characters that would have injected some freshness into the scenes.Like so many shows with great debut seasons, the second season of Felicity suffered a creative slump that had little to do with hair.  The real problems were change of night, loss of a key character and the inability of the writers to realize what story drove their successful first season, leading to them bumbling around with inconsequential pairings, characters and stories that got tired fast.",3,Don't blame the hair for why it went down the tubes.,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,5751,"['Yes', 'Felicity', 'got', 'fugly',

742273,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008GQ33,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Many here have stated that they believe that FELICITY Season Two is the show's best season.  I personally am not quite in synch with that opinion.  I think the first half of Season Two is a bit flat, and some of the episodes just drift, but it rebounds in a big way in the second half of the season.  Primarily this is because it is only in the second half of the season that the bombs start dropping, from the marital problems facing Felicity's parents, to Ruby's unexpected pregnancy (and the even more unexpected revelation about who the father is), to the increasing complexity of Felicity and Ben's relationship.  The first half of the season is just slow to get off the ground and even then is marred by Felicity's unconvincing relationship with the grad student David.Season Two is also when tragedy struck.  Keri Russell cut her hair.  Many actually blame the steep Season Two decline in ratings to The Haircut, though this was more likely due to a change in scheduling (history has shown repeatedly that if you want to kill a show, just keep moving it around, unless it is a megahit with a huge cadre of dedicated fans like LOST).  Nonetheless, Felicity's hair cut often makes various web lists of ""Biggest Mistakes in TV HIstory.""  Fan response to her shorn locks was so negative that the show itself makes numerous jokes about it.  The hair would grow out in subsequent seasons.One of the reasons for FELICITY's success as a long series was the willingness of the producers to bring in new characters.  Some are less successful than others, but some are wonderful additions and are missed when they depart the show.  Amy Smart, an actress I've enjoyed in everything I've seen her in, was especially likable in Season Two as Noel's love interest.  Donald Faison -- well before he was on the staff of Sacred Heart on SCRUBS -- joins the show in the second half of the season as Elena's love interest.  And Amanda Foreman's role as Felicity's bizarre roommate Meghan was expanded (there was also an episode in which Kevin Weisman played a friend of hers -- in ALIAS they would be married and have a child)Speaking of SCRUB's, it is fascinating how many actors who appeared on FELICITY later appeared on that comedy.  Keri Russell herself appeared as a guest star, while Donald Faison, of course, is one of the two male leads.  Scott Foley had a major recurring role as Elliott's love interest.  Amy Smart had a brief but memorable run as a love interest for JD (her character is best captured in the title of one of her episodes, ""My Drama Queen"").The one thing that hurts FELICITY -- as well as nearly every show made in the past 20 years -- has been the widespread and nearly universal conviction in the television industry that while fans love to watch the unfolding of potential romance, they are not interested in fulfilled, ongoing romance,  As a result, the challenge is always to invent ways of keeping couples apart rather than their staying together.  So on LOST Sawyer is used to keep Jack and Kate apart (and then later baby Aaron).  Endless difficulties were introduced to keep Clark and Lana from being a happy couple on SMALLVILLE.  The best ever device for keeping a romantic couple apart is surely Angel's curse on BUFFY (though that is rivaled by the tragedy on PUSHING DAISIES that if Ned ever touches Chuck, she'll die, again, forever).  In Season One of FELICITY Noel was introduced as a way of keeping Felicity and Ben apart, only to have Ben brought back into the picture late to keep Felicity and Noel apart.  By the end of Season Two you pretty much have it figured out that if two people finally manage to get together, bad times are definitely ahead.  Only a couple of shows have tried to show major couples together.  Seth and Summer were a couple for an unusual amount of time on THE O.C., perhaps because their dynamics made them unsuitable for one another on paper.  And in Season Three of THE OFFICE, Pam and Jim managed to have an adorable relationship.  Personally, I would like to see more shows take up the challenge of making a successful relationship interesting.  I'll close by acknowledging that the reason why producers and writers are terrified of getting romantic couples together is the MOONLIGHTING problem.  That show was remarkably successful as long as Dave and Maddie were a potential couple.  As soon as they slept together, however, ratings plummetted (though I personally wonder if the decline in writing and the persistent problem in producing new episodes wasn't more to blame).",5,A

Please!)Felicity was great because I started watching it as a freshman and I know it's corny but I almost felt like I was growing up with her, because it was SO real and true. It so closely resembled things in my college experience and my friends' college experiences. I felt like each season we saw her grow and change into a new individual (loved the change of theme song in season 3).The first season was new, innovative, hopeful, inspiring. It was like being in college - lots of doors were opened and everyone wanted to see which way she'd go.Season two is great because you start to see the other characters come to life. Ben develops, starts to become a person who actually deals with his problems rather than ignoring them and being a jerk.

Instead of rich compelling storylines about college classes and a young woman's journey of self-discovery in those four years, we got the start of the shallow will she pick Ben or Noel storyline? Felicity fornicates with the artist guy for no reason and the aforementioned infamous haircut. This was followed up with even more bizarre choices for the characters: The black chick sleeping with the professor, Ben has a kid by another girl and Julie turning into a basket case.

The hair cut was just that, and plus she looked absolutely cute. But i do have to say that the whole break so early in the season was a bit premature but ended well with Ben realizing that he was ready for someone as intense as Felicity. Almost to the point of losing her. I loved the fact that Felicity was given the chance to possibly have relationships with other guys on the show. Although they seemed a bit doomed from the start. Overall there may have been some chnges to the dynamics of some of the original characters but i think it brought something new to the table. Episodes that i really enjoyed: The Love Bug, mainly due to the fact that it was just hilarious everyone thinking they had mono; Great Expectations, Ben realizes what he gave up; Ben Was Here; Aretha Theory; Final Answer; The Biggest Deal There Is, basically the roles have been reversed and its Ben doing the chasing...And one can't forget the very end when Ben tells Felicity that he loves her.

And I guess the dip of quality of Season 2 didn't help and instead became the start of people's diminished interest with the show as evidenced through its ratings.Honestly I think the show started strong with episodes like Sophomoric and The list but towards the middle there's an obvious decline in quality but towards the end it gained its momentum back but I guess it's too late, some fans already gave up on the show. Season 2 has produced some really fine episodes like the above mentioned Sophomoric (Amanda Foreman stole all scenes she's in), The Slump, Revolutions, Ben Was Here (A great ensemble episode), The Aretha Theory, and the finale The Biggest Deal There is.The weak points of the second season I guess is one The Ruby is pregnant storyline, it took a lot of episodes away from the regular cast, Julie's character seems to wander aimlessly, and to paraphrase the writers they break up Ben and Felicity too early disrupting the momentum.The main selling points in the Special features are the commentaries. I love the commentary that Foreman, Miller, Grunberg, and Johnson did for Sophomoric, it's a riot and just fun to listen to. Keri Russell and Scott Speedman did a fun commentary on the List too, they've said some really funny stuffs although they seem to forget a lot of details from the show, example Scott asked Keri who made the tape to Sally, and he's not kidding! The other three commentaries were good too but those two above are my favorites. There's also an audition clip of Russell for the role and you just know she has the part. I'm disappointed that the other cast's auditions weren't included. There's also a cute Emmy parody by the cast of Law and Order, ER, and X Files. I wished they showed the actual clip when it aired in the Emmys with the laughter etc.I highly recommend this DVD, If you're a fan of the show you probably already have this one, If you're not then watch the first season first.Grade: A-",5,Felicity: Season 2,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,2088,"['show', 'four', 'year', 'run', 'never', 'received', 'accolade', 'deserved', 'one', 'most', 'stylish', 'compelling', 'series', 'young', 'adults', 'guess', 'dip', 'quality', 'Season', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'instead', 'became', 'start', 'people', 'diminished', 'interest', 'show', 'evidenced', 'ratings.Honestly', 'think', 'show', 'started', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Sophomoric', 'list', 'middle', 'obvious', 'decline', 'quality', 'end', 'gained', 'momentum', 'back', 'guess', 'too', 'late', 'fans', 'already', 'gave', 'up', 'show', 'Season', '2', 'produced', 'really', 'fine', 'episodes', 'above', 'mentioned', 'Sophomoric', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'stole', 'scenes', 'Slump', 'Revolutions', 'Ben', 'Was', 'Here', 'A', 'great', 'ensemble', 'episode', 'Aretha', 'Theory', 'finale', 'Biggest', 'Deal', 'is.The', 'weak', 'points', 'second', 'season', 'guess', 'one', 'Ruby', 'pregnant', 'storyline', 'took', 'lot', 'episodes', 'away', 'regular', 'cast', 'Julie', 'character', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'paraphrase', 'writers', 'break', 'up', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'too', 'early', 'disrupting', 'momentum.The', 'main', 'selling', 'points', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'commentaries', 'love', 'commentary', 'Foreman', 'Miller', 'Grunberg', 'Johnson', 'did', 'Sophomoric', 'riot', 'just', 'fun', 'listen', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'did', 'fun', 'commentary', 'List', 'too', ""'ve"", 'said', 'really', 'funny', 'stuffs', 'seem', 'forget', 'lot', 'details', 'show', 'example', 'Scott', 'asked', 'Keri', 'who', 'made', 'tape', 'Sally', 'not', 'kidding', 'other', 'three', 'commentaries', 'were', 'good', 'too', 'two', 'above', 'are', 'favorites', 'also', 'audition', 'clip', 'Russell', 'role', 'just', 'know', 'part', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'other', 'cast', 'auditions', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'also', 'cute', 'Emmy', 'parody', 'cast', 'Law', 'Order', 'ER', 'X', 'Files', 'wished', 'showed', 'actual', 'clip', 'when', 'aired', 'Emmys', 'laughter', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'one', ""'re"", 'not', 'then', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'first.Grade', 'A-']",N/A
