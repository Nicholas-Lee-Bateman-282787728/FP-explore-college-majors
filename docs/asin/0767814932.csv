12243,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0767814932,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I don't know enough about Oscar Wilde's life, apart from the very famous parts, and his writings. So I can't say how accurate this is in the details, but it feels pretty real. That is, the script seems to suggest enough respect for the real Oscar Wilde to keep pretty close to the truth to the extent it is known. I'm therefore assuming it is pretty real. After all, plenty of English majors have studied him in depth, and I figure if this was grossly inaccurate, we would have heard that by now.Stephen Fry plays Wilde. I know I've seen him before, but I don't know where. He really looks like the photos I have seen of Wilde, except that he seems larger than life. I mean literally: tall and broad-shouldered, large head, not to mention larger than life personality, speech and gestures. In short, Fry plays Wilde as I understood him to have been: flamboyant by the standards of his day, but simply dramatic by the standards of this day.Jude Law plays Bosie, Lord Alfred Douglas, son of the Marquis of Queensbury. He's tall and pencil thin, blond and elegant and very well-spoken, and a spoiled brat. His father is something of a martinet, his mother spoils him then complains that he is spoiled. He is wealthy, elegantly dressed, and completely decadent. And he dominated Wilde far more than Wilde understood, from the way I see it. He would have these terrible temper tantrums, and start sounding like his horrible father.Another interesting character played by a very familiar face is Lady Speranza Wilde, Oscar's mother. She's played by Vanessa Redgrave, and you can't help loving her. She's a wild Irish witch, she is, and I happen to be very fond of wild Irish witches.One more familiar face may be hard to recognize. Among the ""rent boys"" you may recognize Orlando Bloom. Or you may not. I thought he looked familiar, but had to check the credits to be sure.Wilde was married and had two sons. His wife Constance behaved as if she thought nothing wrong or odd about his friendships with young men. She liked Robert Ross (Michael Sheen), and practically adopted him as part of the family. I'm not sure if she was naive or simply tolerant. I don't know whether Oscar knew, either.Of course, the court case involving Wilde is well known. The Marquis of Queensbury (Bosie's father) accused Wilde of being a sodomite. Wilde sued him for libel, but dropped the case when the trial seemed to be going against him. Then the crown charged him with indecency and he was sentenced to two years at hard labor. The prison broke his health, and he declined rapidly after that.",5,"Very, Very Wild Wilde",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2571,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'life', 'apart', 'very', 'famous', 'parts', 'writings', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'accurate', 'details', 'pretty', 'real', 'script', 'suggest', 'enough', 'respect', 'real', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'keep', 'pretty', 'close', 'truth', 'extent', 'known', ""'m"", 'therefore', 'assuming', 'pretty', 'real', 'plenty', 'English', 'majors', 'have', 'studied', 'depth', 'figure', 'was', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'would', 'have', 'heard', 'now.Stephen', 'Fry', 'Wilde', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'really', 'photos', 'have', 'seen', 'Wilde', 'larger', 'life', 'mean', 'literally', 'tall', 'broad-shouldered', 'large', 'head', 'not', 'mention', 'larger', 'life', 'personality', 'speech', 'gestures', 'short', 'Fry', 'Wilde', 'understood', 'have', 'been', 'flamboyant', 'standards', 'day', 'simply', 'dramatic', 'standards', 'day.Jude', 'Law', 'Bosie', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'Douglas', 'son', 'Marquis', 'Queensbury', 'tall', 'pencil', 'thin', 'blond', 'elegant', 'very', 'well-spoken', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'father', 'something', 'martinet', 'mother', 'then', 'spoiled', 'wealthy', 'elegantly', 'dressed', 'completely', 'decadent', 'dominated', 'Wilde', 'far', 'more', 'Wilde', 'understood', 'way', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'terrible', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'start', 'sounding', 'horrible', 'father.Another', 'interesting', 'character', 'played', 'very', 'familiar', 'face', 'Lady', 'Speranza', 'Wilde', 'Oscar', 'mother', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'loving', 'wild', 'Irish', 'witch', 'happen', 'be', 'very', 'fond', 'wild', 'Irish', 'witches.One', 'more', 'familiar', 'face', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'recognize', 'rent', 'boys', 'may', 'recognize', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'may', 'not', 'thought', 'looked', 'familiar', 'had', 'check', 'credits', 'be', 'sure.Wilde', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'two', 'sons', 'wife', 'Constance', 'behaved', 'thought', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'odd', 'friendships', 'young', 'men', 'liked', 'Robert', 'Ross', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'practically', 'adopted', 'part', 'family', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'naive', 'simply', 'tolerant', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Oscar', 'knew', 'either.Of', 'course', 'court', 'case', 'involving', 'Wilde', 'well', 'known', 'Marquis', 'Queensbury', 'Bosie', 'father', 'accused', 'Wilde', 'being', 'sodomite', 'Wilde', 'sued', 'libel', 'dropped', 'case', 'when', 'trial', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'Then', 'crown', 'charged', 'indecency', 'was', 'sentenced', 'two', 'years', 'hard', 'labor', 'prison', 'broke', 'health', 'declined', 'rapidly']",N/A

I have for most of my life been interested in Oscar Wilde and his work.  My great uncle, Richard Le Gallienne was a good friend of Wilde's.

Humility was not a strong suite in either man.Very poor eyesight makes it nearly impossible for me to read so I was glad tfor the oportunity to watch this movie.  I am afraid it disappointed me.  I hoped this would shed some light on Wilde's work, his thinking, and his place in the great literature of the world.  I am not a homosexual, and I hold no prejudice where homosexuality is concerned.  I was aware of his sexual orientation long, long ago.It seems to me the movie producers were most interested in selling their production and not so interested in the content of Wilde's life or work.

12250,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,0767814932,Charles S. Houser,"[6, 6]","Carefully researched and responsibly adapted for the screen, this film is based primarily on Richard Ellman's highly regarded 1988 biography ""Oscar Wilde."" (Ellman's book is out of print, but still relatively easy to find). The film essentially covers the latter part of the great Irish writer's life--his fall from grace when he is publicly challenged by the Marquess of Queensberry for having sexual relations with the Marquess's son, Lord Alfred Douglas (called ""Bosie""). This is much the same turf covered by the exceptional play by Moises Kaufman, ""Gross Indecency"" (the script of this play is still in print). Unlike the play which consists almost entirely of trial transcripts, press coverage, and the writings of Wilde and others involved in the case, the film only turns to primary sources when needed. The filmmakers are less concerned with the legal tedium (three separate trials have been collapsed into what appears to be one), the larger issues of the decline of the British Empire, and the unraveling of Victorian morality in the face of modernity. Their primary interest seems to be the exploration of Wilde's psychology and the hold Douglas had on him. Careful to avoid the anachronistic use of terms like ""homosexual"" and ""bisexual"", Wilde is depicted as deeply fond of his wife Constance and their sons while being mesmerized by Douglas and the gay underworld of brothels and rentboys that they explore together. If the filmmakers are guilty of anything, it may be for depicting Wilde with too much sympathy. Wilde seems at times to be a saintly victim. Certainly he was more responsible for the consequences of his actions than the filmmakers suggest.This film, it should be said, is perfectly cast. Stephen Fry is as physically as close to Wilde as any casting director is likely to find; Jude Law's flawless beauty is put to good use in the role of Bosie; and Tom Wilkinson is a volatile and scary Marquess of Queensberry. The supporting actors are equally superb. The filmmakers make an odd choice to use Wilde's fairy tale ""The Selfish Giant"" as a recurring theme throughout the story, perhaps to emphasize Wilde's physical size, or to show that he was a loving and caring father who easily spun out fairy tales to entertain his sons. In these senses it works. But it seems to inflate the importance of that minor work within Wilde's corpus. ""Lady Windermere's Fan,"" ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" ""The Importance of Being Ernest,"" and ""Salome"" are only mentioned in passing. And Wilde's great prison work, ""De Profundis,"" (150 pages in the Viking Portable Library edition) is cavalierly referred to as ""a letter to Bosie.""The DVD extras are wonderful: two lengthy featurettes and audio commentary by the producer, director, screenwriter, and Fry.

12254,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0767814932,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[135, 140]","If anything, the value of true love and compassion, unfettered by social interdictions, and how the Victorian attitudes made only a certain kind of love a crime, is the driving force behind Wilde.  The bio-movie of legendary playwright and wit Oscar Wilde begins with his trip to Leadville, Colorado in 1882, where a seam in a silver mine has been named in his honour.  Down the mine, he tells the story of The King's Dream, about how the king has dreams revealing how lesser class people have toiled and suffered so that nobles can wear finery and wield sceptres and ornaments of silver and gold.Wilde seems to have it, talent, wit, a nice wife, two children.  It's at the reception for his play, Lady Windermere's Fan, that we see the beginning of the end.  There, Wilde is introduced to Lord Alfred Douglas, nicknamed ""Bosie"", a handsome blond who finds conventional morality stifling, such as his enjoyment of other men, but whose selfishly immature, egotistic nature comes out in an ugly way later in the movie.  ""Bosie"" admires Wilde.  ""You use wit like a knife, cut through all those starched shirt fronts.  You draw blood.  It's magnificent,"" he tells him.Bosie introduces Wilde to secret parlors where there are others who have homosexual leanings, but he seems proud to display himself as ""Wilde's boy"", wanting the whole world to know, whereas Wilde is a bit more on the cautious and side.  Yet he counsels Bosie, who is then in a petulant pique that Wilde has to work on his play instead of having fun, that ""pleasure have to be earned and paid for.""  And yet he is patient and forgiving towards the lad.The villain of this piece is Bosie's brutish father, John Sholto Douglas, better known as the 9th marquis of Queensbury, he who invented the boxing rules such as wearing gloves, the ten second count, and rounds.  He strongly disapproves of Bosie's friendship with Wilde and sets about verbally intimidating both.The attitudes of the stuffed shirts in Victorian England can be found in a lady's comment on censorship:  ""There must be censorship.  All people would say what they meant, and then where would we be?""  Wilde too gives a view of the stifled times when he says that if his son grew up, ""he must do as his nature dictates, as I should have done.""  But couldn't, one should add.At various parts of the movie, Wilde's story of ""The Selfish Giant"" is narrated to match the scene or Wilde's feelings.All throughout, Wilde's wit and observations on human nature are heard.  Examples:  ""Give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth.""  This in turn leads to a conversation about The Picture Of Dorian Gray, a novel about ""the masks we wear as faces, the faces we wear as masks"" that lost the Wildes their respectability for its unveiling the hypocritical veneer of Victorian gentility.  But the most important is this:  ""In this world there are only two tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants.  The other is getting.""Those who know of Wilde's life knows how it'll end, but there are some sobering narrated observations that reflect the suffering he underwent:  ""Life cheats us with shadows.  We ask it for pleasure, it gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train.""  Or the way people destroy the thing they love most:Some do it with a bitter looksome with a flattering wordthe coward with a kissThe brave man with a swordsome kill their love when they are youngand some when they are oldsome strangle with the hands of lustsome with the hands of goldthe kindest use a knifebecause the dead so soon grow coldStephen Fry, best known as Jeeves in the Jeeves and Wooster series does a top-notch job in portraying the playwright and wit. His Wilde is suave, charming, loving and understanding to his wife, children, and Bosie, and in the end, unwilling to perjure himself and his beliefs despite its meaning his fall from grace. Jude Law does good as Bosie, but Jennifer Ehle also deserves credit as the soft-spoken but loyal and beautiful Constance Wilde.",4,The Portrait of Oscar Wilde--one of wit and compassion,1070582400,"12 5, 2003",2003,3997,"['anything', 'value', 'true', 'love', 'compassion', 'unfettered', 'social', 'interdictions', 'how', 'Victorian', 'attitudes', 'made', 'only', 'certain', 'kind', 'love', 'crime', 'driving', 'force', 'Wilde', 'bio-movie', 'legendary', 'playwright', 'wit', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'trip', 'Leadville', 'Colorado', '1882', 'where', 'seam', 'silver', 'mine', 'been', 'named', 'honour', 'mine', 'story', 'King', 'Dream', 'how', 'king', 'dreams', 'revealing', 'how', 'lesser', 'class', 'people', 'have', 'toiled', 'suffered', 'so', 'nobles', 'can', 'wear', 'finery', 'wield', 'sceptres', 'ornaments', 'silver', 'gold.Wilde', 'have', 'talent', 'wit', 'nice', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'reception', 'play', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'see', 'beginning', 'end', 'Wilde', 'introduced', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'Douglas', 'nicknamed', 'Bosie', 'handsome', 'blond', 'who', 'conventional', 'morality', 'stifling', 'such', 'enjoyment', 'other', 'men', 'selfishly', 'immature', 'egotistic', 'nature', 'out', 'ugly', 'way', 'later', 'movie', 'Bosie', 'Wilde', 'use', 'wit', 'knife', 'cut', 'starched', 'shirt', 'fronts', 'draw', 'blood', 'magnificent', 'him.Bosie', 'introduces', 'Wilde', 'secret', 'parlors', 'where', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'homosexual', 'leanings', 'proud', 'display', 'Wilde', 'boy', 'wanting', 'whole', 'world', 'know', 'whereas', 'Wilde', 'bit', 'more', 'cautious', 'side', 'Bosie', 'who', 'then', 'petulant', 'pique', 'Wilde', 'work', 'play', 'instead', 'having', 'fun', 'pleasure', 'have', 'be', 'earned', 'paid', 'yet', 'patient', 'forgiving', 'towards', 'lad.The', 'villain', 'piece', 'Bosie', 'brutish', 'father', 'John', 'Sholto', 'Douglas', 'better', 'known', '9th', 'marquis', 'Queensbury', 'who', 'invented', 'boxing', 'rules', 'such', 'wearing', 'gloves', 'ten', 'second', 'count', 'rounds', 'strongly', 'Bosie', 'friendship', 'Wilde', 'sets', 'verbally', 'intimidating', 'both.The', 'attitudes', 'stuffed', 'shirts', 'Victorian', 'England', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'lady', 'comment', 'censorship', 'must', 'be', 'censorship', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'what', 'meant', 'then', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'Wilde', 'too', 'view', 'stifled', 'times', 'when', 'son', 'grew', 'up', 'must', 'do', 'nature', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'one', 'should', 'add.At', 'various', 'parts', 'movie', 'Wilde', 'story', 'Selfish', 'Giant', 'narrated', 'match', 'scene', 'Wilde', 'feelings.All', 'Wilde', 'wit', 'observations', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'heard', 'Examples', 'Give', 'man', 'mask', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'truth', 'turn', 'conversation', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'novel', 'masks', 'wear', 'wear', 'masks', 'lost', 'Wildes', 'respectability', 'unveiling', 'hypocritical', 'veneer', 'Victorian', 'gentility', 'most', 'important', 'world', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'tragedies', 'One', 'not', 'getting', 'what', 'one', 'other', 'getting', 'who', 'know', 'Wilde', 'life', 'how', ""'ll"", 'end', 'are', 'sobering', 'narrated', 'observations', 'reflect', 'suffering', 'underwent', 'Life', 'shadows', 'ask', 'pleasure', 'bitterness', 'disappointment', 'train', 'way', 'people', 'destroy', 'thing', 'love', 'most', 'do', 'bitter', 'looksome', 'flattering', 'wordthe', 'coward', 'kissThe', 'brave', 'man', 'swordsome', 'kill', 'love', 'when', 'are', 'youngand', 'when', 'are', 'oldsome', 'strangle', 'hands', 'lustsome', 'hands', 'goldthe', 'kindest', 'use', 'knifebecause', 'dead', 'so', 'soon', 'grow', 'coldStephen', 'Fry', 'best', 'known', 'Jeeves', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster', 'series', 'top-notch', 'job', 'portraying', 'playwright', 'wit', 'Wilde', 'suave', 'charming', 'loving', 'understanding', 'wife', 'children', 'Bosie', 'end', 'unwilling', 'perjure', 'beliefs', 'meaning', 'fall', 'grace', 'Jude', 'Law', 'good', 'Bosie', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'also', 'credit', 'soft-spoken', 'loyal', 'beautiful', 'Constance', 'Wilde']",N/A
12255,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767814932,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 11]","I have somewhat conflicting opinions about this film, just as I have conflicting opinions about Oscar Wilde himself.  No one can dispute the fact that Wilde was a literary genius; ample proof of this is found in the successful rehabilitation of his work in reputation long before the aspects of his infamous lifestyle became acceptable to even a minor fraction of society.  If, as hardly seems possible, you aren't aware of the scandal associated with Wilde's downfall, this film spares the viewer few of the most intimate of details (in other words, there is male nudity - and plenty of it).  It's a brave film, featuring a most accomplished class of actors and actresses turning in terrific performances, but it doesn't feel perfectly complete to me.  Rather than delivering a flamboyant Oscar Wilde who truly reveled in his own audacity, this Oscar Wilde seemed subdued and sometimes even haunted by the lifestyle he led.  While his wit is demonstrated quite often, this didn't quite seem like the young man who became the toast of London before he met with his first literary success and reveled in the danger inherent in his forays into the London underworld of homosexuality.  Maybe it's just impossible to capture the true spirit of this most singular of men, but I just felt as if this film tried to cast Wilde as something of a victim led astray by all these pretty young boys and a man doomed by his own nature, and I don't completely buy into that.I was also somewhat disappointed by the fact that Wilde's writing played only an incidental role in this story.  We don't get a very good sense of the shocking nature of The Picture of Dorian Gray to Victorian society, apart from the comments of young Lord Alfred ""Bosie"" Douglas (Jude Law) upon his introduction to the author, and Wilde's successful plays provide little more than short moments in the sun for Wilde to receive the cheers of appreciative audiences on opening nights.  There's basically no commentary on the relationship between Wilde's writing and his life.I don't want to sound too negative, however, as I think this is a wonderful film.  Stephen Fry makes for a wonderful, albeit subdued, Oscar Wilde, but Jude Law turns in a much more memorable performance as Bosie.  With his flamboyant nature, sudden mood swings between devil-may-care flamboyance and taciturn childishness, and natural coquettishness, he dominates one scene after another.  Wilde, in fact, becomes something of a pathetic creature at times, a helpless instrument in the hands of a young seducer whom he must suspect will ultimately lead to his downfall and disgrace.  Certainly, there was little chance of keeping this extended dalliance a protected secret, but one cannot blame Bosie's father - evil brute that he was - from seeking Wilde's destruction.  The irony, of course, is that Wilde engineered his own downfall, as it was his decision to sue the Marquess of Queensberry for libel (and to thereby perjure himself in court) that led to his arrest for gross indecency.I certainly can't admire anything about Oscar Wilde's personal life beyond his brave determination to be nothing less than who he truly was, even when that meant facing two back-breaking years of manual labor in prison.  I do admire his genius, however, and I don't think there's any doubt that his exploits influenced the society of his day and age.He helped define one era and ushered in the dawn of a new one.  Most of all, he was just bloody fascinating.  Any movie about his life would be noteworthy, and this one is certainly that.",4,It's a wild Wilde life -- and a fascinating film,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,3560,"['have', 'somewhat', 'conflicting', 'opinions', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'conflicting', 'opinions', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'one', 'can', 'dispute', 'fact', 'Wilde', 'was', 'literary', 'genius', 'ample', 'proof', 'found', 'successful', 'rehabilitation', 'work', 'reputation', 'long', 'aspects', 'infamous', 'lifestyle', 'became', 'acceptable', 'even', 'minor', 'fraction', 'society', 'hardly', 'possible', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'scandal', 'associated', 'Wilde', 'downfall', 'film', 'viewer', 'few', 'most', 'intimate', 'details', 'other', 'words', 'male', 'nudity', 'plenty', 'brave', 'film', 'featuring', 'most', 'accomplished', 'class', 'actors', 'actresses', 'turning', 'terrific', 'performances', ""n't"", 'feel', 'perfectly', 'complete', 'Rather', 'delivering', 'flamboyant', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'who', 'truly', 'reveled', 'own', 'audacity', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'seemed', 'subdued', 'sometimes', 'even', 'haunted', 'lifestyle', 'led', 'wit', 'demonstrated', 'quite', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'toast', 'London', 'met', 'first', 'literary', 'success', 'reveled', 'danger', 'inherent', 'forays', 'London', 'underworld', 'homosexuality', 'just', 'impossible', 'capture', 'true', 'spirit', 'most', 'singular', 'men', 'just', 'felt', 'film', 'tried', 'cast', 'Wilde', 'something', 'victim', 'led', 'astray', 'pretty', 'young', 'boys', 'man', 'doomed', 'own', 'nature', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'buy', 'that.I', 'was', 'also', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'Wilde', 'writing', 'played', 'only', 'incidental', 'role', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'good', 'sense', 'shocking', 'nature', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Victorian', 'society', 'apart', 'comments', 'young', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'Bosie', 'Douglas', 'Jude', 'Law', 'introduction', 'author', 'Wilde', 'successful', 'plays', 'provide', 'little', 'more', 'short', 'moments', 'sun', 'Wilde', 'receive', 'cheers', 'appreciative', 'audiences', 'opening', 'nights', 'basically', 'commentary', 'relationship', 'Wilde', 'writing', 'life.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'too', 'negative', 'however', 'think', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'wonderful', 'albeit', 'subdued', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Jude', 'Law', 'much', 'more', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Bosie', 'flamboyant', 'nature', 'sudden', 'mood', 'swings', 'devil-may-care', 'flamboyance', 'taciturn', 'childishness', 'natural', 'coquettishness', 'one', 'scene', 'Wilde', 'fact', 'something', 'pathetic', 'creature', 'times', 'helpless', 'instrument', 'hands', 'young', 'seducer', 'whom', 'must', 'suspect', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'downfall', 'disgrace', 'Certainly', 'was', 'little', 'chance', 'keeping', 'extended', 'dalliance', 'protected', 'secret', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'Bosie', 'father', 'evil', 'brute', 'was', 'seeking', 'Wilde', 'destruction', 'irony', 'course', 'Wilde', 'engineered', 'own', 'downfall', 'was', 'decision', 'sue', 'Marquess', 'Queensberry', 'libel', 'thereby', 'perjure', 'court', 'led', 'arrest', 'gross', 'indecency.I', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admire', 'anything', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'personal', 'life', 'brave', 'determination', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'even', 'when', 'meant', 'facing', 'two', 'back-breaking', 'years', 'manual', 'labor', 'prison', 'do', 'admire', 'genius', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'doubt', 'exploits', 'influenced', 'society', 'day', 'age.He', 'helped', 'define', 'one', 'era', 'ushered', 'dawn', 'new', 'one', 'Most', 'was', 'just', 'bloody', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'one', 'certainly', 'that']",N/A

12266,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,0767814932,James Hiller,"[13, 14]","Oscar Wilde's life was drama in the making, from his raucous and wonderful comedies, to his ridiculously unfair and dark imprisonment. Fortunately, Wilde captures the best and worst of it all, wonderful, in the movie &quot;Wilde&quot;.Much of the credit of this film must go to Stephen Fry's marvelous performance as Wilde himself. This was the role Fry was born to play. To portray a man seemingly larger than life can be a tricky role: it leads to overacting and an unbelievable quality as Wilde's best one liners roll off his tongue. But Fry captures his humility, making him human and believable. You think, as he recounts of his best lines, they are truly parts of the conversation and not merely injected to make people laugh.Fry also keys into the heartbreak behind the man, in trying to deal with his wife Constance, in an equally amazing performance by Jennifer Ehle, and his true love, the disturbed, spoiled Bosie Douglas, in another amazing performace by Jude Law. Wilde's caught between two worlds he desparately wants to join, that of being a father and being with the man he loves. His trail only adds to the sadness, so when he falls into prison, you realize that perhaps, his time in incarceration started before the trial took place.Wilde was a genuis, to be sure, and this film is our reminder that the man deserves the recognition in the US as he's earned in the rest of the world.",5,Heart Behind the Wit,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,1401,"['Oscar', 'Wilde', 'life', 'was', 'drama', 'making', 'raucous', 'wonderful', 'comedies', 'ridiculously', 'unfair', 'dark', 'imprisonment', 'Fortunately', 'Wilde', 'best', 'worst', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'quot', 'Wilde', 'quot', '.Much', 'credit', 'film', 'must', 'go', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Wilde', 'was', 'role', 'Fry', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'portray', 'man', 'seemingly', 'larger', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'role', 'overacting', 'unbelievable', 'quality', 'Wilde', 'best', 'one', 'liners', 'roll', 'off', 'tongue', 'Fry', 'humility', 'making', 'human', 'believable', 'think', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'truly', 'parts', 'conversation', 'not', 'merely', 'injected', 'make', 'people', 'laugh.Fry', 'also', 'keys', 'heartbreak', 'man', 'trying', 'deal', 'wife', 'Constance', 'equally', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'true', 'love', 'disturbed', 'spoiled', 'Bosie', 'Douglas', 'amazing', 'performace', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Wilde', 'caught', 'two', 'worlds', 'desparately', 'join', 'being', 'father', 'being', 'man', 'trail', 'only', 'sadness', 'so', 'when', 'prison', 'realize', 'perhaps', 'time', 'incarceration', 'started', 'trial', 'took', 'place.Wilde', 'was', 'genuis', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'reminder', 'man', 'recognition', 'US', 'earned', 'rest', 'world']",N/A
12267,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,0767814932,James Morris,"[217, 243]","I really am puzzled by the number of people who somehow find the sexual aspect of a story concerning one of the most celebrated gay men in history too explicit.  I mean, what did they expect?First let me offer my review of Wilde - every moment of this film is brilliant.  It perfectly articulates the shame behind a supreme waste of talent and the unjust imprisonment of one of the great literary geniuses of the English language.  The sets, costumes and dialogue all manage to faithfully invoke the manners and attitudes of Victorian England.  Stephen Frye gives a performance that is nothing less than incredible, and his physical resemblance to the real Oscar Wilde is downright spooky.  The supporting cast is perfect, and the script pretty much says all that needs to be said about his trial, conviction and downfall.  So what's not to like?Some have complained that the film has focused too much on Wilde's sexuality and not enough on his literary accomplishments.  But the purpose of the film is clearly to illustrate the travesty of justice that robbed the world of one of literatures greatest figures.  Those who are interested in knowing what a fine writer Wilde was need only to acquire a book of his collected works or seek out a production of one of his theatre pieces.  The purpose of this film is to show how Victorian morality cruelly destroyed the life of a great man.Now let's talk about the ""graphic sex scenes""...I recently heard a ""liberal"" commentator on a radio show discussing the film Brokeback Mountain.  He said, and I quote, ""I am all for gay liberation.  I support the right of gays to marry, and leave their property to their partners.  I will sign your petitions, march in your parades, write my legislators pleading for laws to protect you, and argue with my conservative relatives on your behalf.  But I cannot see Brokeback Mountain.  Please don't ask me to.  I just can't look at explicit gay sex.  I'm sorry, but I am just not comfortable with it"".For him, and those who have the same reaction to ""Wilde"" I have but two words - grow up!I am a 51 year old gay man.  As a movie lover, I have sat through literally thousands of cinematic heterosexual love scenes in my life.  I have watched men and women ""suck face"" and caress each other's naked bodies until I was fairly nauseous.  For the record, I do not enjoy watching heterosexuals make love.  While it doesn't exactly revolt me, it certainly isn't something I find appealing, either, but I have had to put up with it as long as I can remember.  After all, one cannot go to a movie or turn on the television without seeing endless examples of graphic heterosexual lovemaking.  And guess what?  For all the sexually explicit straight love scenes I've sat through, I've managed to get through them intact.  My eyeballs haven't fallen out, my penis hasn't shriveled up and blown away, and I have not turned heterosexual from watching all that straight sex.  I would suggest to those who ""support gay rights"" but are ""uncomfortable"" with explicit gay sex scenes that they purchase a DVD of a gay film with about as much sexually graphic content as they think they can stand, and then watch it over and over and over until they are no longer uncomfortable with gay sex scenes.  I think that would be fair; after all, I have been forced to acclimate myself to straight love scenes to the point where they no longer make me uncomfortable.  But in renting such a film, I would NOT suggest Brokeback Mountain - I saw it last week.  The ""graphic"" sex scenes last all of 60 seconds, and the same sex kissing scene (there is only one) takes up even less screen time than that.As for Wilde, several heterosexual reviewers on this site complained that the ""sex scenes"" were far too graphic for them and their friends.  Some even went to far as to claim that ""half the movie"" contained sexual content.  My initial reaction to these comments was, HUH???  Gay sex?  WHAT gay sex?  I have seen this film three times, and I don't remember any gay sex scenes in it.  At all.  So I just went back and watched it a fourth time, with a notepad and a stopwatch.  Gee, it turns out there is some gay sex in it.  What follows is a complete description of everything in the film that could even remotely be called a ""sex scene"":Fourteen minutes into the film, Oscar Wilde is seduced by the character of Robbie.  Robbie kisses Oscar, then removes his own shirt, pulls down his pants, and places Oscar's hands on his exposed buttocks.  They embrace.  The scene fades.  No actual sex is shown, and the scene lasts a total of one minute, exactly.Two minutes later, there is a depiction of Oscar and Robbie in bed.  Robbie is shirtless; Oscar has his arms around him.  They kiss.  There is no suggestion of actual sex.  The scene fades after a total of 45 seconds.A few minutes later, Oscar meets a young man at an art exhibit.  They leave together.  The next scene shows the young man shirtless and sitting on a sofa.  Oscar is standing above him.  He pulls Oscar down to the sofa, while kissing him.  The scene fades; it has lasted exactly 15 seconds, and has not shown any actual sex.Twenty-five minutes into the film, Oscar meets Bosie, played by Jude Law.  Thirty-one minutes into the film, we see Bosie's naked torso, he is clearly in the throws of passion.  He thrusts once, as though climaxing.  The camera pans to reveal he is on top of Oscar, who appears to be nude.  They kiss.  The scene fades.  It has lasted 50 seconds, and is the first and only time we see Oscar undressed.  Although there is the suggestion that sex has taken place between them, no sex is actually shown.Forty minutes into the film, Bosie takes Oscar to a male brothel, where Bosie puts his arms around a male prostitute; both are clothed.  Their intimacy lasts about 4 seconds.  There is no suggested or actual depiction of sex.At one hour and seven minutes into the film, we see Bosie in bed with another ""rent boy"" while Oscar sits in a chair watching, fully clothed.  We see the couple in bed through a mirror; it is a long shot, but Bosie's buttocks are clearly visible, and he is thrusting his body as though in sexual coitus.  This is the only scene in the entire film that I would label ""sexually graphic"" and it lasts exactly 6 seconds.  It is also the last ""sex"" scene in the film, which continues for an additional 50 minutes.Of all the ""sex"" scenes in the film, none show genitalia, or depict contact with genitalia.  In all but one scene Oscar is fully dressed.  The on-screen same-sex kisses last less than one minute, total, and, all told, the sex scenes described above - if one could really call them that - last a TOTAL of exactly three minutes; only 6 seconds of those sex scenes could be described as ""graphic"" - out of one hour and fifty-seven minutes of screen time.  Hardly ""half the movie"" as one reviewer put it.After reading some of the reviews posted here, I wonder if these people saw the same film I did.  Because all the ""gay sex"" they complain about is hardly there.  The only ""graphic"" sex scene lasts six seconds, yet one would think from reading those reviews that this film was hardcore pornography.  Can these reviewers really be that hung up on gay sex that they see graphic images where almost none exist?I have seen hundreds of ""mainstream"" films with far more explicit sex scenes involving heterosexuals in my day, many of which were truly gratuitous and excessive.  If I were to cry and whine, ""Look what me and my poor gay friends had to witness"" every time I saw a tasteless straight sex scene, I'd never stop crying and whining.Just once I wish straight people could see things from my view.  I have had heterosexual romance shoved down my throat all my life.  If you are straight and are reading this, my advice is: don't be such a sissy.  Straight sex scenes never harmed me, and gay sex scenes aren't going to hurt you, either.  If you want to see a good dramatic film about a famous homosexual, be prepared to expect a little gay sex, and PLEASE don't get hung up about it.",5,Too Sexually Explicit???,1135814400,"12 29,

12268,A2PBDB92U5WIJA,0767814932,Janis Cortese,"[25, 27]","This movie is everything about why I love the courageous, crisp, brainy and brilliant British media.  Stephen Fry is a gem who could recite the phone book and turn it into a soliloquy on the cruelty of human history.  His voice is marvelous, and he rolls his consonants around in his mouth like Jordan almonds -- all without affectation, somehow.  Wilde's many quips and epigrams drop out of his mouth without the slightest artificiality, natural and thoughtless as dew rolling off a leaf.  Jude Law's Bosie is terrifyingly unstable, and his beauty serves only to throw his instability into high relief.  You can't take your eyes off of him while he's on screen at the same time you want to turn away and skitter under the cabinets to stop watching.The rest of the supporting cast is magnificent (if only the American film industry permitted its great actresses to work past the age of 40, we might boast such luminaries as Vanessa Redgrave and Zoe Wanamaker someday as well as Helen Mirren and Judi Dench!), the directing is flawless, the costumes and set design stunning but never overstated.  All of it is used only to support the story, and as beautiful as it all is, it never pulls you out of the story or distracts you, only providing a seamless and textured foundation for the action.I admit, I'm somewhat amused at the reviewers who imagine that this film shouldn't have concentrated so much on Wilde's sexuality.  This is the story of him as much his work -- and his work at any rate was quite informed by his sexuality, nebulous at best during a time when anything but rigid adherence to a particularly joyless version of heterosexuality was a sin and a crime.  Beautiful as this film is (and delicious as it is to see so many gorgeous young British men running around au naturel), it breaks your heart with the realization that happiness and fulfillment in life, as well as success and self-respect, can be so profoundly influenced by nothing more significant than the year in which one was born.

12269,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,0767814932,John D. Cofield,"[1, 1]","I missed this film when it was in theaters and only recently got a chance to see it.  When it started I thought at first that there had been some bizarre mixup at the DVD factory, because how could Oscar Wilde of all people have anything to do with a Colorado silver mine?  But then Stephen Fry showed up in the role he was born to play, and I remembered that Wilde had made a tour of the United States in the early 1880s that included a stop at a silver mine.  That first scene displays Wilde at his best: an elegant, extremely intelligent, and witty man speaking to a group of miners who hang on his every word. It sets a high standard that fortunately is maintained throughout the rest of the film.The screenplay for Wilde was based on Richard Ellman's celebrated biography.  It focuses on Wilde's career from about the mid 1880s until shortly before his death in 1900.  That's the time period when he achieved great success as a writer and playwright, made an at first happy marriage (his wife Constance is admirably portrayed by Jennifer Ehle), but then began to recognize that his sexual and romantic tastes favored handsome young men. His liaison with Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law) brought him to ruination at the height of his success when an ill considered libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry, Lord Alfred's brute of a father, led to his prosecution and imprisonment.Stephen Fry displays Wilde in all his grace, brilliance, and self-destructiveness.  Bon mots from Wilde's own pen are scattered liberally throughout the dialogue, and the supporting cast, including Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Parfitt, Ioann Gruffud, Michael Sheen, Zoe Wanamaker, and Tom Wilkinson as Lord Queensberry is absolutely perfect.  This is a film which is as great a masterpiece as any play or story by Oscar Wilde himself, and there can be no higher praise.",5,Wilde As He Really Was,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1851,"['missed', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'only', 'recently', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'When', 'started', 'thought', 'first', 'had', 'been', 'bizarre', 'mixup', 'DVD', 'factory', 'how', 'could', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'all', 'people', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Colorado', 'silver', 'mine', 'then', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'showed', 'up', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'remembered', 'Wilde', 'had', 'made', 'tour', 'United', 'States', 'early', '1880s', 'included', 'stop', 'silver', 'mine', 'first', 'scene', 'displays', 'Wilde', 'best', 'elegant', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'man', 'speaking', 'group', 'miners', 'who', 'hang', 'word', 'high', 'standard', 'fortunately', 'maintained', 'rest', 'film.The', 'screenplay', 'Wilde', 'was', 'based', 'Richard', 'Ellman', 'celebrated', 'biography', 'Wilde', 'career', 'mid', '1880s', 'shortly', 'death', '1900', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'achieved', 'great', 'success', 'writer', 'playwright', 'made', 'first', 'happy', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Constance', 'admirably', 'portrayed', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'then', 'began', 'recognize', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'tastes', 'favored', 'handsome', 'young', 'men', 'liaison', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'Douglas', 'Jude', 'Law', 'brought', 'ruination', 'height', 'success', 'when', 'ill', 'considered', 'libel', 'suit', 'Marquess', 'Queensberry', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'brute', 'father', 'led', 'prosecution', 'imprisonment.Stephen', 'Fry', 'Wilde', 'grace', 'brilliance', 'self-destructiveness', 'Bon', 'mots', 'Wilde', 'own', 'pen', 'are', 'scattered', 'liberally', 'dialogue', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'Ioann', 'Gruffud', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Lord', 'Queensberry', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'film', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'play', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'can', 'be', 'higher', 'praise']",N/A

I watched the movie primarily as a fan of Stephen Fry. I really enjoyed his portrayal of Wilde; he plays Wilde with most of the very characteristics that Fry himself (publicly, anyway) possesses: warmth, sympathy, generosity and a little vulnerability. That said, I began to wonder just how accurate that portrayal really is. I've read enough about Wilde to get the impression that he was brilliantly dry, witty, droll and sarcastic. But I saw barely any of that on the screen. I can understand that he wouldn't show his ""dinner party face"" with his family or children, but neither can I see him being as awkward and embarrassed as he appears to be in the scene with Alfred Taylor's rent-boys. So I'm left wondering who the ""real"" Oscar Wilde really was. Most people, no doubt, certainly would know better than I do. I certainly liked Oscar Wilde's personality in this film, anyway. Jude Law plays ""Bosie"" wonderfully, regardless of how accurate his portrayal might be (again, I don't know enough about him to know whether it is.) He is sweet and tender in one scene, and hateful and narcissistic in the next and both are very believable. He also bares as striking resemblance to the real Bosie as Fry does to Wilde (though both are really better looking than their characters.)I concur with other reviewers that not enough emphasis is placed upon Wilde's work and the creation process, other than perhaps the story he wrote for his boys. I came away knowing little more than I started with, which is virtually nil. However, I disagree with others that the sex is over-emphasized or excessive or graphic. I didn't come away thinking it was any more graphic/excessive than any other R-rated film would be; if anything, a good deal less. I didn't, however, learn how Wilde came to realize that he was bisexual/homosexual. One minute he's looking wistfully at an attractive younger man, the next, he's in bed with an attractive younger man (not necessarily the same younger man.) Perhaps IRL Wilde _didn't_ experience any inner conflict or struggle with his sexual identity, but I would still like to have seen more of the realization process. Still, this is a wonderful film that I would recommend to anyone interested in either Oscar Wilde or Stephen Fry, as well as Jude Law and Michael Sheen.",4,How accurate?,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,2407,"['find', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'as', 'intriguing', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'am', 'not', 'scholar', 'works', 'life', 'watched', 'movie', 'primarily', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'Wilde', 'Wilde', 'most', 'very', 'characteristics', 'Fry', 'publicly', 'anyway', 'possesses', 'warmth', 'sympathy', 'generosity', 'little', 'vulnerability', 'said', 'began', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'really', ""'ve"", 'read', 'enough', 'Wilde', 'get', 'impression', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'dry', 'witty', 'droll', 'sarcastic', 'saw', 'barely', 'screen', 'can', 'understand', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'dinner', 'party', 'face', 'family', 'children', 'can', 'see', 'being', 'awkward', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'scene', 'Alfred', 'Taylor', 'rent-boys', ""'m"", 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'real', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'really', 'was', 'Most', 'people', 'doubt', 'certainly', 'would', 'know', 'better', 'do', 'certainly', 'liked', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'personality', 'film', 'anyway', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Bosie', 'wonderfully', 'regardless', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'might', 'be', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'know', 'sweet', 'tender', 'one', 'scene', 'hateful', 'narcissistic', 'next', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'also', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Bosie', 'Fry', 'Wilde', 'are', 'really', 'better', 'looking', 'characters', 'concur', 'other', 'reviewers', 'not', 'enough', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Wilde', 'work', 'creation', 'process', 'other', 'perhaps', 'story', 'wrote', 'boys', 'came', 'away', 'knowing', 'little', 'more', 'started', 'virtually', 'nil', 'However', 'disagree', 'others', 'sex', 'over-emphasized', 'excessive', 'graphic', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'more', 'graphic/excessive', 'other', 'R-rated', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'good', 'deal', 'less', 'did', ""n't"", 'however', 'learn', 'how', 'Wilde', 'came', 'realize', 'was', 'bisexual/homosexual', 'One', 'minute', 'looking', 'wistfully', 'attractive', 'younger', 'man', 'next', 'bed', 'attractive', 'younger', 'man', 'not', 'necessarily', 'same', 'younger', 'man', 'Perhaps', 'IRL', 'Wilde', ""_didn't_"", 'experience', 'inner', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'sexual', 'identity', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'realization', 'process', 'Still', 'wonderful', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'as', 'well', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Michael', 'Sheen']",N/A

First, I read &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; the wittiest play ever written in the English language.  Second, there was Monty Python's Oscar Wilde sketch, where Wilde, James McNeil Whistler and George Bernard Shaw force each other to turn insults into compliments for the Prince of Wales.  Third, there was the &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; mini-series &quot;Lillie,&quot; in which Peter Egan played Wilde and where for the first time I heard the speech from Wilde's court case where he explains &quot;the love that dare not speak its name.&quot;  It is one of the most unforgettable declarations from the docket in human history and I think I just about have it memorized because it was really burned into my mind the first time I heard it.When I watched &quot;Wilde,&quot; my knowledge and understanding of Oscar Wilde was extended in several key ways.  In playing the title role actor Stephen Fry makes Wilde seem less the dandy and more the kindly man he must have been to be put in the situation that caused his down fall.  In contrast, Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law), known as &quot;Bosie,&quot; might be beautiful of face but it is most decidedly skin deep.  He is an ugly human being and when Wilde does what he does out of the goodness of his heart, the tragedy that it is for somebody who does not deserve it.  I had not really thought much of Bosie before, but after watching &quot;Wilde&quot; I consider him a most despicable figure.  Wilde was in prison within three months after the opening of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and the thought of what has been lost to literature and drama is rather sickening.  It is only in the film's final scene that for the first time I found myself thinking of Oscar Wilde as a pathetic figure, and again it was because of Bosie.I had long appreciated the irony that despite his homosexuality Wilde truly loved his wife Constance (Jennifer Ehle), but in Julian Mitchell's screenplay, based on Richard Ellmann's noted biography, I learn an even greater irony with regards to Wilde's downfall, namely that his physical relationship with Bosie had been of short duration and that they were not lovers at the time of the libel suit involving the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson). In that regard this 1997 film enhances the tragic aspects of the story.

12278,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,0767814932,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[8, 8]","A very impressive retelling of the tragic life story of Oscar Wilde - and surprisingly accurate too (the filmmakers may be forgiven for having Constance's tombstone inscribed ""wife of Oscar Wilde"", a text that was in fact only added many years later; tragically, when Wilde visited the grave, there was no mention of him on it at all.) Much like the sinking of the Titanic, the Wilde story has all the ingredients of intense drama: glamorous lives turned on their heads, a plunge from the heights of fame into utter disaster, the devastating effects of hubris and sheer stupidity, and a good dollop of nostalgia. Put all that in a supremely well cast, well-paced and well-dressed movie, and a memorable experience results.Stephen Fry is just about the living embodiment of Wilde, his big-boned features even providing an uncanny physical resemblance. His transformation to the broken man Wilde was after Reading Gaol is painfully believable.  Jude Law as Alfred Douglas excels in the only type of role he seems really fit to play, that of the vapid, self-obsessed pretty boy. Smaller roles abound in luxury casting, e.g., Vanessa Redgrave as Wilde's Bohemian mother, and Ioan Gruffudd as John Gray. Jennifer Ehle, of Pride and Prejudice fame, is very impressive as the tormented Constance - so impressive indeed that the marital relationship and family life of the Wildes becomes the emotional core of the film - interwoven, like a red thread, with the story of the Selfish Giant, told in voice-over. The viewer is made to feel rather less sympathy for Oscar's homosexual exploits in a world dominated by a self-centered lover and herds of opportunistic rent boys. (in passing you may spot Orlando Bloom making his extremely brief big screen debut as one of them). Michael Sheen as Robbie Ross (the only sympathetic role I've ever seen him in) is the redeeming feature, and much like in reality does not receive his due for it.Apparently there are people who even today hold Victorian views like Wilde's judge,  who felt that the extent of the law really was too limited to punish his behaviour adequately. Such people will have you believe this movie is some kind of gay hardcore production. Ridiculous, of course. The depiction of Wilde's ""second life"" is not encumbered by any of the hypocrisies that still tainted Hollywood-made Brokeback Mountain 8 years later, but it never exceeds the boundaries of functionality or good taste. Of course, if you can't stand the sight of men kissing (or of Jude Law's derriere), that's your problem.",5,"A haunting tragedy, accurately retold",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2539,"['very', 'impressive', 'retelling', 'tragic', 'life', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'surprisingly', 'accurate', 'too', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'be', 'forgiven', 'having', 'Constance', 'tombstone', 'inscribed', 'wife', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'text', 'was', 'fact', 'only', 'added', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'tragically', 'when', 'Wilde', 'visited', 'grave', 'was', 'mention', 'Much', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'Wilde', 'story', 'ingredients', 'intense', 'drama', 'glamorous', 'lives', 'turned', 'heads', 'plunge', 'heights', 'fame', 'utter', 'disaster', 'devastating', 'effects', 'hubris', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'good', 'dollop', 'nostalgia', 'Put', 'supremely', 'well', 'cast', 'well-paced', 'well-dressed', 'movie', 'memorable', 'experience', 'results.Stephen', 'Fry', 'just', 'living', 'embodiment', 'Wilde', 'big-boned', 'features', 'even', 'providing', 'uncanny', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'transformation', 'broken', 'man', 'Wilde', 'was', 'Reading', 'Gaol', 'painfully', 'believable', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Alfred', 'Douglas', 'excels', 'only', 'type', 'role', 'really', 'fit', 'play', 'vapid', 'self-obsessed', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Smaller', 'abound', 'luxury', 'casting', 'e.g.', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Wilde', 'Bohemian', 'mother', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'John', 'Gray', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'fame', 'very', 'impressive', 'tormented', 'Constance', 'so', 'impressive', 'indeed', 'marital', 'relationship', 'family', 'life', 'Wildes', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'interwoven', 'red', 'thread', 'story', 'Selfish', 'Giant', 'told', 'voice-over', 'viewer', 'made', 'feel', 'rather', 'less', 'sympathy', 'Oscar', 'homosexual', 'exploits', 'world', 'dominated', 'self-centered', 'lover', 'herds', 'opportunistic', 'rent', 'boys', 'passing', 'may', 'spot', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'making', 'extremely', 'brief', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'one', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Robbie', 'Ross', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'role', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'much', 'reality', 'not', 'receive', 'due', 'it.Apparently', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'even', 'today', 'hold', 'Victorian', 'views', 'Wilde', 'judge', 'who', 'felt', 'extent', 'law', 'really', 'was', 'too', 'limited', 'punish', 'behaviour', 'adequately', 'Such', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'movie', 'kind', 'gay', 'hardcore', 'production', 'Ridiculous', 'course', 'depiction', 'Wilde', 'second', 'life', 'not', 'encumbered', 'hypocrisies', 'still', 'tainted', 'Hollywood-made', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '8', 'years', 'later', 'never', 'boundaries', 'functionality', 'good', 'taste', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'sight', 'men', 'kissing', 'Jude', 'Law', 'derriere', 'problem']",N/A

Given the subject matter, it's hardly surprising that nerves were struck and many reviews here are more about judging Wilde's lifestyle than the film.Everyone is going to have his own views on the subject so I'm going to stick to reviewing the film as much as I can and leave the rest to others.I've been a big fan of Wilde's plays for a long time but didn't know much about his life other than what was common knowledge--the scandals and imprisonment.  So part of the enjoyment of this film was learning more about him---his marriage, his children, and the circumstances that led to his trial and downfall.Steven Fry has been quoted as saying that this is the role he was born for and who can disagree with that?  He is incredible.  If one were to entertain thoughts of reincarnation it would be easy to speculate that Oscar, in the afterlife, might have chosen just this person to come back and show the world his side of the story, with immense charm, enormous intelligence and bountiful compassion.  He is physically huge, very impressive and his amazing immense sweet smile rivals that of Santa Claus.  Then there is this deep powerful but velvet voice (my words are inadequate to do him justice....)  He won my heart in the first few minutes of the film. (I read that he has narrated the audio book version of the Harry Potter series, which makes me want to run out and buy them.)It's impossible to fit the life of such a complex person into a two hour time frame and so choices have to be made.  Since homosexuality was what brought Oscar down, it has to be shown and it's my feeling that the amount of screen time devoted to the affair with ""Bosie,"" Oscar's amour fatal, and the way their relationship is shown is entirely appropriate.  The choice of Jude Law as Bosie was a perfect one--who else could have seduced this intelligent man into making the choices that ruined him and his family.  Law is so gorgeous (once People magazines' choice of ""sexiest man on the planet"") that I didn't mind at all seeing his nude body no matter what he was doing, or with whom. :-)Vanessa Redgrave adds her special spice to the role of Wilde's mother, no mousy type herself. The supporting cast is all perfect.As others have mentioned, this is not the foppish dandy that many have imagined Wilde to be, but a man of immense stature and compassion who seems to have done whatever he did for love.  As such it gives us enormous sympathy for him.  As a woman I do have to wonder about his wife, and how his choices affected her.  Wouldn't it be interesting to have heard her side of the story?  And the children?

The screenwriter obviously wrote it with Richard Ellman's stellar biography in one hand, and except for one small bit, stays astonishingly true to the facts of Wilde's life.  The accuracy is one of the two things that makes this film so fascinating.  The other is the remarkable performances by the films actors.  Stephen Fry is nothing short of remarkable, acting Wilde as a real person, instead of a parody or caricature of Wilde.  Jude Law, in one of his first notable screen performances, is appropriately fetching as Alfred Lord Douglas (and I do admire his courage as a heterosexual actor portraying so convincingly a homosexual siren).  Tom Wilkinson, who each year seems to distinguish himself more and more as one of the most versatile and talented actors in film, is suitably vicious and tenacious as Lord Douglas's father, the Marquess of Queensbury.  He strikes perfectly the pose of evangelical fervor and philistinism that one detects in reading of the real Marquess.  Jennifer Ehle is excellent in the thankless role of Wilde's wife.  The movie depicts quite accurately Wilde's intention in prison to return to his wife after leaving prison, an intention that was frustrated by her death before his release.  His relationship with Robbie Ross, who was in real life probably Wilde's most faithful and dedicated friend, is shown in moving detail.The lone complaint I have with the film is the omission of the past couple of years of Wilde's life.  Although he was reunited with Alfred Lord Douglas briefly upon his release from prison, their attempted reconciliation was largely a failure, and they eventually went their own ways, with Lord Douglas completely turning his back on Wilde during his time of greatest need.  The end of Wilde's life was heartbreakingly tragic, with Wilde often employing his considerable conversational skills in entertaining strangers for the cost of a few drinks.  The contrast between the Oscar Wilde who had multiple plays running simultaneously in London in the 1890s and the Wilde who died nearly friendless and penniless in France in 1900 is as poignant as any in literary history.  In 1895, he is the toast of London; in 1900, a pariah.  But perhaps this alternative version of Wilde's life would have been too bleak.  Even without the fuller ending, this is a very sad and tragic film.  And WILDE proves that you can have a biopic that can, at the same time, maintain an exceedingly high degree of historical advocacy while remaining dramatically engrossing.",5,Both enormously entertaining and amazingly accurate biopic,1045612800,"02 19, 2003",2003,2598,"['most', 'part', 'one', 'most', 'amazingly', 'accurate', 'biopics', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screenwriter', 'obviously', 'wrote', 'Richard', 'Ellman', 'stellar', 'biography', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'small', 'bit', 'astonishingly', 'true', 'facts', 'Wilde', 'life', 'accuracy', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'film', 'so', 'fascinating', 'other', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'films', 'actors', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'nothing', 'short', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'Wilde', 'real', 'person', 'instead', 'parody', 'caricature', 'Wilde', 'Jude', 'Law', 'one', 'first', 'notable', 'screen', 'performances', 'appropriately', 'fetching', 'Alfred', 'Lord', 'Douglas', 'do', 'admire', 'courage', 'heterosexual', 'actor', 'portraying', 'so', 'convincingly', 'homosexual', 'siren', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'year', 'distinguish', 'more', 'more', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'talented', 'actors', 'film', 'suitably', 'vicious', 'tenacious', 'Lord', 'Douglas', 'father', 'Marquess', 'Queensbury', 'perfectly', 'pose', 'evangelical', 'fervor', 'philistinism', 'one', 'detects', 'reading', 'real', 'Marquess', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'excellent', 'thankless', 'role', 'Wilde', 'wife', 'movie', 'quite', 'accurately', 'Wilde', 'intention', 'prison', 'return', 'wife', 'leaving', 'prison', 'intention', 'was', 'frustrated', 'death', 'release', 'relationship', 'Robbie', 'Ross', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'Wilde', 'most', 'faithful', 'dedicated', 'friend', 'shown', 'moving', 'detail.The', 'lone', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'omission', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'Wilde', 'life', 'was', 'reunited', 'Alfred', 'Lord', 'Douglas', 'briefly', 'release', 'prison', 'attempted', 'reconciliation', 'was', 'largely', 'failure', 'eventually', 'went', 'own', 'ways', 'Lord', 'Douglas', 'completely', 'turning', 'back', 'Wilde', 'time', 'greatest', 'need', 'end', 'Wilde', 'life', 'was', 'heartbreakingly', 'tragic', 'Wilde', 'often', 'employing', 'considerable', 'conversational', 'skills', 'entertaining', 'strangers', 'cost', 'few', 'drinks', 'contrast', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'who', 'had', 'multiple', 'plays', 'running', 'simultaneously', 'London', '1890s', 'Wilde', 'who', 'died', 'nearly', 'friendless', 'penniless', 'France', '1900', 'as', 'poignant', 'literary', 'history', '1895', 'toast', 'London', '1900', 'pariah', 'perhaps', 'alternative', 'version', 'Wilde', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'bleak', 'Even', 'fuller', 'ending', 'very', 'sad', 'tragic', 'film', 'WILDE', 'can', 'have', 'biopic', 'can', 'same', 'time', 'maintain', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'degree', 'historical', 'advocacy', 'remaining', 'dramatically', 'engrossing']",N/A

The wit, the charm, the intelligence, the endless unfolding of Wilde's brilliance gushes across the widescreen. The added dialogue couldn't have been written better if it had been written by Wilde himself. And Jude Law's performance is equally superb.

12291,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,0767814932,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Wilde' is the 1997 film biographical film of the legendary playwright, author and poet, whose career was cut short after being prosecuted for being a homosexual in 19th century England. It stars the enormously versatile Stephen Fry, who bears a striking resemblance to the actual Oscar Wilde found in old photographs taken of him. Jude Law, who plays Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas (aka 'Bosie'), also resembles the real 'Bosie' of history. The 1997 version towers over the 1960 film starring Robert Morley, who was completely miscast as the sensitive Wilde.One of the main objections to this new 'artistic version', is that not enough attention was paid to Wilde's professional career as a writer. May I respectfully disagree with these opinions? If one wants to find out about Wilde's career as a writer, why not go and read 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' or watch 'The Importance of Being Earnest'? There is nothing inherently dramatic about his rise to the top in the literary circles he moved in. What is FAR MORE dramatic, is the whole history of Wilde's fall from grace, following his malicious prosecution by an intolerant Victorian society.Another objection from critics on the internet, is that there's too much emphasis here on Wilde's moments of intimacy, particularly with Bosie. Ignoring those prurient souls who find any images or suggestions of gay sex to be abhorrent, a case can be made that those scenes emphasizing Wilde's sexual proclivities, do slow the film down in the first half. On the other hand, by refusing to ignore them, screenwriter Julian Mitchell, has faithfully rendered Wilde's desires as well as his compulsions.The first half of 'Wilde' indeed is quite slow, as most of the real 'drama', doesn't kick in, until the second half. In the first half, we're introduced to Wilde's caring wife and two children, along with Bosie and how Wilde gradually becomes enamored with him. The danger Mitchell almost falls into, is making Wilde into too much of a nice guy. As it turns out, Mitchell makes it clear that Wilde did have his Achilles heel. And that of course was Bosie. Why did the brilliant and sensitive Wilde, fall for a lout like Bosie? Clearly, the younger man is continually unfaithful and goes as far as attending orgies, where he has sex with other men, and Wilde has no guilt feelings about playing the part of voyeur. There was obviously something that Wilde saw in Bosie and chose to concentrate on the good points and not the bad. On the other hand, Wilde did indeed recognize that Bosie was quite troubled, but due to his good nature, forgave him, arguing that his unfaithful lover couldn't help himself, due to being victimized by an abusive father.Wilde is much more than a story about a great writer. The prosecution of Oscar Wilde is a seminal moment in the history of society's attitude toward homosexuality. In the modern era, the trial of Oscar Wilde marked the beginning and the Stonewall Riots, perhaps marked the end of society's non-acceptance of homosexuality. The most absorbing part of 'Wilde' is the conflict that develops between Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensbury, who accuses Wilde of corrupting his son. As it turns out, Wilde falls into the trap that Bosie's father has set for him: he sues him for criminal libel, ignoring friends' advice that the father's accusations that he actually engaged in sex with men, were true. Wilde's poetic defense of himself during the trial, sadly holds no weight, as the Victorian judge and jury, make it clear that they no have tolerance for Wilde's behavior, regardless of his motives.'Wilde' is a very well made, artistic film, that does an excellent job of recounting Oscar Wilde's personal history and sad, public fate. If you're willing to tolerate a slow-moving first half, you will be rewarded at film's end, which emphasizes the tragedy of a brilliantly talented man, whose career was cut short, due to a society which wasn't ready to accept him, merely on the basis of his sexual predilections, alone.",4,"Fine, artistic biopic of famed writer, despite slow first half",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,4064,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Wilde"", '1997', 'film', 'biographical', 'film', 'legendary', 'playwright', 'author', 'poet', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'being', 'homosexual', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'enormously', 'versatile', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'actual', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'found', 'old', 'photographs', 'taken', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'Wilde', 'lover', 'Lord', 'Alfred', 'Douglas', 'aka', ""'Bosie"", 'also', 'real', 'history', '1997', 'version', 'towers', '1960', 'film', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'miscast', 'sensitive', 'Wilde.One', 'main', 'objections', 'new', ""'artistic"", 'version', 'not', 'enough', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'Wilde', 'professional', 'career', 'writer', 'May', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'opinions', 'one', 'find', 'out', 'Wilde', 'career', 'writer', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'read', ""'The"", 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'watch', ""'The"", 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'dramatic', 'rise', 'top', 'literary', 'circles', 'moved', 'What', 'FAR', 'MORE', 'dramatic', 'whole', 'history', 'Wilde', 'fall', 'grace', 'following', 'malicious', 'prosecution', 'intolerant', 'Victorian', 'society.Another', 'objection', 'critics', 'internet', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'here', 'Wilde', 'moments', 'intimacy', 'particularly', 'Bosie', 'Ignoring', 'prurient', 'souls', 'who', 'find', 'images', 'suggestions', 'gay', 'sex', 'be', 'abhorrent', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'scenes', 'emphasizing', 'Wilde', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'do', 'slow', 'film', 'down', 'first', 'half', 'other', 'hand', 'refusing', 'ignore', 'screenwriter', 'Julian', 'Mitchell', 'faithfully', 'rendered', 'Wilde', 'desires', 'as', 'well', 'compulsions.The', 'first', 'half', ""'Wilde"", 'indeed', 'quite', 'slow', 'most', 'real', ""'drama"", ""n't"", 'kick', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'half', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Wilde', 'caring', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'Bosie', 'how', 'Wilde', 'gradually', 'enamored', 'danger', 'Mitchell', 'almost', 'making', 'Wilde', 'too', 'much', 'nice', 'guy', 'out', 'Mitchell', 'clear', 'Wilde', 'did', 'have', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'course', 'was', 'Bosie', 'Why', 'did', 'brilliant', 'sensitive', 'Wilde', 'fall', 'lout', 'Bosie', 'Clearly', 'younger', 'man', 'continually', 'unfaithful', 'as', 'far', 'attending', 'orgies', 'where', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'Wilde', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'playing', 'part', 'voyeur', 'was', 'obviously', 'something', 'Wilde', 'saw', 'Bosie', 'chose', 'concentrate', 'good', 'points', 'not', 'bad', 'other', 'hand', 'Wilde', 'did', 'indeed', 'recognize', 'Bosie', 'was', 'quite', 'troubled', 'due', 'good', 'nature', 'forgave', 'arguing', 'unfaithful', 'lover', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'due', 'being', 'victimized', 'abusive', 'father.Wilde', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'great', 'writer', 'prosecution', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'seminal', 'moment', 'history', 'society', 'attitude', 'homosexuality', 'modern', 'era', 'trial', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'marked', 'beginning', 'Stonewall', 'Riots', 'perhaps', 'marked', 'end', 'society', 'non-acceptance', 'homosexuality', 'most', 'absorbing', 'part', ""'Wilde"", 'conflict', 'Bosie', 'father', 'Marquess', 'Queensbury', 'who', 'Wilde', 'corrupting', 'son', 'out', 'Wilde', 'trap', 'Bosie', 'father', 'set', 'criminal', 'libel', 'ignoring', 'friends', 'advice', 'father', 'accusations', 'actually', 'engaged', 'sex', 'men', 'were', 'true', 'Wilde', 'poetic', 'defense', 'trial', 'sadly', 'weight', 'Victorian', 'judge', 'jury', 'make', 'clear', 'have', 'tolerance', 'Wilde', 'behavior', 'regardless', 'motives', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'artistic', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'recounting', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'personal', 'history', 'sad', 'public', 'fate', ""'re"", 'willing', 'tolerate', 'slow-moving', 'first', 'half', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'film', 'end', 'tragedy', 'brilliantly', 'talented', 'man', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'due', 'society', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'accept', 'merely', 'basis', 'sexual', 'predilections', 'alone']",N/A
