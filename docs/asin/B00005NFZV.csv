Bought this dvd went to the san diego concert. The dvd has a mix of jazz, funk, disco, the only thing that is missing is a blu ray version although this dvd is very well produced. However when you are really enjoying something you want it to be the best it can be. My highest recommendation for katg fans and others who enjoy this genre of music.",5,Just had to get up and dance,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,461,"['Horns', 'horns', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'Had', 'forgotten', 'katg', 'met', 'Singapore', 'Tokyo', 'airports', 'Bought', 'dvd', 'went', 'san', 'diego', 'concert', 'dvd', 'mix', 'jazz', 'funk', 'disco', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'dvd', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'However', 'when', 'are', 'really', 'enjoying', 'something', 'want', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'katg', 'fans', 'others', 'who', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'music']",N/A

I'm going to give you a review from an avid DVD buyer and fan of bands such as Earth Wind Fire, Chicago, Tower of Power, and others.The camera work is fantastic and modern (recorded in 2001).  The sound is fantastic, with pumping drums and bass, and warm and jazzy trumpets.  EXCELLENT SOUND, and in DTS 5.1 if you want it.  That part of the DVD is ALL SET.The set list is nice and funky, with some welcome intermissions in jazz (they kind of sound like Chicago meets Earth Wind Fire in some of the songs).  I had previously only heard their ""pop"" funk songs, but after listening to this DVD I have a lot of respect for the new musicians of Kool & The Gang.  They got the chops.One thing: three or four members of the original crew are here, the rest of the 7-8 other musicians are new bloods whose energy and talent are great.I enjoy this DVD greatly and pop it in often.  Buy it.
