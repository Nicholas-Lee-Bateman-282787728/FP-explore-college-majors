It will be a great watch for the Pre-k to first grade classrooms. The DVD teaches the letter names. Most importantly, it teaches the letter sounds in a creative way. Viewers see the letters, hear the letter names, they see a picture/video that represents the sound each letter makes, and the viewer hears a catchy tune to match the letter sound. For instance, the letter C is shown in a cold environment with ice hanging from it. The letter comes to life by shivering and stating that it is /c/ /c/ /c/.... old. Then the characters in the story sing the catchy Leapfrog song; ""The C says/c/, the C says /c/, every letter makes a sound. The C says /c/. This DVD/VHS is marketed towards parents to use with their PreK to First grader, but all teachers need to know about this video and share it with their class. It would be a great review or introduction to letter sounds. Teachers could also use the catchy phrases and visual representation of the letter sounds in their lessons by creating activities or visuals based on the video.

PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get Letter Factory from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.I am so THRILLED that I did! I thought for SURE he'd suspect that I was ""getting him to learn"" (make no mistake, PDD-NOS doesn't mean a low IQ!), but surprisingly, he's been watching Letter Factory on a consistent basis for WEEKS now! I'll even hear him singing the catchy songs to himself as he goes about his business.In the DVD, Tad (Leap's younger brother) joins Professor Quigley to all the different rooms where new letters learn their sounds. For example, when they enter the A room, there's a silly purpose monster that scares the little A's into saying ""ahhhh!"" In the K room, the little K's are practicing their karate kicks as they learn how to make the ""kay"" sound.What's especially great about the Letter Factory is that it combines the visuals of the letters with the sound that the letter makes in a very catchy tune. For example, as the F's are flying, they sing ""the F says 'eff', the F says 'eff'...every letter makes a sound, the F says 'eff'"". This method helps both audio and visual learners to grasp the sounds...not to mention those that are more musically inclined.I see my son applying what he's learned (very quickly, I might add!) to books. He'll now pick up books from the library ON HIS OWN, and attempt to sound out the words.

I was not sure what to expect when I bought it, but I was confident on the quality of Leap Frog products in general.  This video is no exception.  The cartoon features a story which takes the younger of the Frog kids, Tad, through the Letter Factory training rooms where he learns all the sounds the letters make.  Each letter is afforded about a minute of time, which does not seem like much, but with repetition (my daughter asks to see this video several times every day since I purchased it) the children remember more and more of the letters and sounds.  The video is 35 minutes long.  The story is interesting to children and uses a combination of songs and visual prompts to help the kids learn and remember the letters and their sounds.  My daughter was singing along with this video the first time she saw it.  While I don't think this video is enough to teach children their letters, I do think that as part of a learning program it is a wonderful learning tool.  I use the video, then bring out my daughter's My First Leap Pad (I Know My ABC's) for her to use, I help her write the letters on her Magna Doodle, set up art activites for her with the letters, read her ABC books, cut out textured sand paper letters for her to play with, etc.  The only things I found missing in this video are that they only give the short vowel sounds and that they don't talk enough about lower case letters. However it is only a 35 minute video, and I can teach her those other concepts myself.  I also thought they went through the letters a bit fast for kids having trouble with basic letter recognition, but again, it is a short video and parents can always use other techniques to help their children with letter recognition (plus repetitive viewing of the video can help).

I expect this to balance out later, as she will be bilingual, but I really worried about the selection of english language learning materials for preschoolers that i would find when I went, so I loaded up and hand carried 400 pounds of of phonics materials, videos and workbooks. This was by far the best of the bunch.My 1 yr old is still a bit young for it, but she dances to the songs, and the 3 yr old absolutely loves it. It has even helped her mother and aunts refine thier accents. The baby einstein stuff is pretty slow paced for a 3 yr old, but I expect to get some extra legs out of them since she is really just getting her first exposure to english with them. They are good for the baby, and good to bore the 3yr old away from the TV for awhile(she wants to watch the letter factory 24 hours a day). Although it kills any dreams of limitting TV time, these videos are extra important, becuase I want her to get a solid grounding in english, and especially proper American Standard dialact...something just not available, even in the english speaking prescool I just enrolled her in, since everyone speaks english with an accent - which is to be expected.On a side note, I was pretty ticked off at Disney..although the baby einstein materials are obviously good quality, I do feel like I paid 300 bucks for a total of about 45 minutes of sock puppets and video of toys that I could have bought for less than the cost of the videos. But worst of all, among the ABC stuff that was available in PI...much of it was by Disney Corp...and they had the audacity to use ""Disney"" for the letter D on an ABC poster...what a shameless stab at cultivating brand loyalty.

Do not expect a movie of cinematic genius, but do expect something your pre-schooler will love.  Aside from the letter learning, the story and how the characters interact and treat eachother is charming and appropriate without being too saccharin.Additionally, and most importantly, he was repeating letter sounds the very first time he watched it.  He already has a favorite letter, ""W"", which he calls ""double.""  He dances to the music and I think it helps that he has the magnetic letter set and the little player that came with them sings the same song for each letter and it's sound, so he recognized it.I was nervous when it first started playing because the legal warnings at the beginning were very poor video quality and I thought maybe the whole movie would be that bad, but it was ok once the movie started.

My wife saw this at the library and borrowed it.  The kids wanted to rent it every time they went to the library.  I decided to pick it up from Amazon so we wouldn't have to worry about someone else borrowing it and not being able to borrow it ourselves.Besides the kids loving it...I love it.  My two year old walks around the house and when he sees letters anywhere he will start to make the letter sounds.  He can also put together a letter puzzle with very little help. So, he is actually learning something from this video.  The wife and I don't like letting the kids watch TV too much, but at least with this video they are learning while being entertained....can't say that about many other cartoons and kid shows.  Sure some kid shows teach things, but they don't teach the whole alphabet in a half hour.I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to entertain and teach their kids at the same time.",5,My kids love it...Entertaining and Educational,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1014,"['kids', 'love', 'video', 'started', '4', 'year', 'old', 'now', '2', 'year', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'My', 'wife', 'saw', 'library', 'borrowed', 'kids', 'wanted', 'rent', 'time', 'went', 'library', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'Amazon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'someone', 'else', 'borrowing', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'borrow', 'kids', 'loving', 'love', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'walks', 'house', 'when', 'letters', 'anywhere', 'will', 'start', 'make', 'letter', 'can', 'also', 'put', 'together', 'letter', 'puzzle', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'So', 'actually', 'learning', 'something', 'video', 'wife', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'TV', 'too', 'much', 'least', 'video', 'are', 'learning', 'being', 'entertained', '.ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'many', 'other', 'cartoons', 'kid', 'shows', 'Sure', 'kid', 'teach', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'whole', 'alphabet', 'half', 'hour.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'entertain', 'teach', 'kids', 'same', 'time']",N/A

I was amazed. So I tested him by saying each letter and asking him to make the sound and he knew all of them! My friends were stunned, he knew his letter sounds better than the little girl who lives next door that is two years older.He's now three, and he still enjoys watching the movie, singing and saying the sounds along with the movie. He also has theLeapFrog Leapster Educational Video: The Letter Factory, which is another favorite. He would sit and watch the whole thing, again when he was only two.I also likeLeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Set, which reinforces everything from the movie, and is actually a little better as it gives dual sounds when appropriate.Another toy they make that I love isLeapFrog Explorer Smart Globe.

The thing I like about this DVD that's different from the other learning DVD's is that it's set up to look like a real cartoon, not just jumping to A IS FOR APPLE, B IS FOR BUTTERFLY etc. I was skeptical about buying it since none of the other DVD's have worked, nor have the hundreds of alphabet books we own, so I just went ahead and bought the letter factory, talking words factory and word factory 2 along with math circus (wich is nowhere NEAR as good as the other 3). After 1 week of watching this video once a day he learned alot of the alphabet and the letter sounds. As of now, 2wks after purchasing it, he knows all but 4 letters by sight. I also bought the letter factory game to go along with the DVD and to give him time away from TV while still learning his alphabet and the letter sounds. The game is great because it's basic enough for a 2yo to play it but it also has 2 levels for more advance play. On level one you have to find the card color and on level 2 you have to find the actual letter. I HIGHLY recommend this movie AND the letter factory game to go along with it (Kohls.com has an exclusive game tin that I like better than the cardboard box).",5,After 2 wks my 2.5 yo knows his letters and their sounds!!!!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,1259,"[""'ve"", 'bought', 'everything..', 'DVD', 'books', 'games', 'anything', 'help', 'son', 'learn', 'letters', 'thing', 'like', 'DVD', 'different', 'other', 'learning', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'look', 'real', 'cartoon', 'not', 'just', 'jumping', 'IS', 'FOR', 'APPLE', 'B', 'IS', 'FOR', 'BUTTERFLY', 'etc', 'was', 'skeptical', 'buying', 'none', 'other', 'DVD', 'have', 'worked', 'have', 'hundreds', 'alphabet', 'books', 'own', 'just', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'letter', 'factory', 'talking', 'words', 'factory', 'word', 'factory', '2', 'math', 'circus', 'wich', 'nowhere', 'NEAR', 'as', 'good', 'other', '3', '1', 'week', 'watching', 'video', 'once', 'day', 'learned', 'alot', 'alphabet', 'letter', 'now', '2wks', 'purchasing', '4', 'letters', 'sight', 'also', 'bought', 'letter', 'factory', 'game', 'go', 'along', 'DVD', 'give', 'time', 'away', 'TV', 'still', 'learning', 'alphabet', 'letter', 'game', 'great', 'basic', 'enough', '2yo', 'play', 'also', '2', 'levels', 'more', 'advance', 'play', 'level', 'one', 'have', 'find', 'card', 'color', 'level', '2', 'have', 'find', 'actual', 'letter', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'movie', 'letter', 'factory', 'game', 'go', 'along', 'Kohls.com', 'exclusive', 'game', 'tin', 'like', 'better', 'cardboard', 'box']",N/A
