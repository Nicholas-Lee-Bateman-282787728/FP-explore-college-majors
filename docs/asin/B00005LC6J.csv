Psychologically, he was a fully-delusional schizophrenic w/ cannibalistic tendencies. He was also a murderer and a grave robber. As a human being, GEIN was both terrifying and pathetic. His life spiraling ever deeper into oblivion after the death of his domineering, hyper-religious mother. Still, it must be pointed out that his story is also extremely important to modern horror. His life's influence is echoed in the characters of Norman Bates (PSYCHO), Leatherface (TCM), and Buffalo Bill (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS). Seeing as these three films were each groundbreaking in their day, one could argue that GEIN has guided horror's path for the last 50 years! ED GEIN the movie brings it all full circle, by showing us the man behind the hideous mythology. Steve Railsback (HELTER SKELTER, LIFEFORCE) is every bit as superb in the title role as he was as Manson all those years ago.

That's the line from the film ""Pet Detective"" that I thought about when they first showed the inside of Ed Gein's farmhouse.  Creepy.I saw a documentary about Gein recently, and that documentary made me ""want"" to see this film, if ""want"" is the correct word.  Maybe more like have an interest with what really happened behind the scenes.  This movie was told from his viewpoint, and there are plenty of scenes where the director tried to show Gein's dark side through interactions with his dead mother, which surely had to be mostly speculation.  Speculation that was probably right though, given the fact that Gein was diagnosed with schizophrenia.Nowadays, there supposedly are scientific tests - and more knowledge about the brain - that allows doctors to determine if a subject really has the disease.  Back then?  Probably not.  So doctors were probably simply guessing that this was what was wrong with Gein, although after reading about - and seeing his behaviors - it was most likely a good diagnosis.Gein is not listed as a serial killer, since it has supposedly been proved that he ""only"" killed two women, and from what I remember, one must kill at least three people to be ""rewarded"" that title.  Most likely he killed quite a few more than two though; it is speculated that he at least killed his brother as well.  But with all of the body parts laying around his house, you'd have to guess there were more than that.  Was Gein a cannibal?  Supposedly he said no during interrogation, but the movie more than aludes to the idea that he was.  My guess:  Gein was lying when he said that he wasn't, so I think that the writer and director got this right.The critics mostly panned this film, although a few seemed to really like it.

662970,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B00005LC6J,David Grant,"[27, 27]","Ed Gein was not one of the world's most prolific serial killers, but he is one of the most imitated. Several classic movie maniacs have been inspired by his real life crimes (Norman Bates, Leatherface, and 'Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill, to name a few). But few people are really aware of the man who not only inspired a slew of slasher films but also a couple of heavy metal songs ('Dead Skin Mask' by Slayer, anyone?). This film, by director Chuck Parello, fresh off of another serial killer flick, 'Henry 2: Mask of Sanity', tries to play it's subject matter straight and indeed it does. There are no fake scares, no cheap one-liners, no charismatic killers slicing and dicing nubile young coeds. It is a serious and disturbing character study, a psychological tale that dwells very, very deep in the mind of it's title character. Played by the great character actor Steve Railsback (who played Charlie Manson in 'Helter Skelter' back in 1976) Ed Gein is a slow-witted child of a man, unable to cope with the passing of his mother (played by another great character actor, Carrie Snodgress). He goes about digging up graves and trying to resurrect the corpses. He is a cannibal and a necrophile and, in the movie's most jarring scene, enjoys dressing in the skin of his victims. The violence presented in the film is not terribly explicit, instead relying on suggestion to achieve a discomforting effect. For all it's merits however, 'Ed Gein' fails on many levels. Most of the supporting cast feels under-developed and under-acted. The low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel which would be great if the movie was devised to be that kind of film. And there is one truly ridiculous scene involving completely unbelieveable computer generated fire effects that ruins the illusion of reality that Parello and Co. tried so hard to create. But all in all, 'Ed Gein' is a triumph. It's rare that a genre filmmaker like Parello chooses subject matter that could so very easily become nothing more then run-of-the-mill blood and guts fodder and actually turns it into an informative and engrossing tale. But he does. Railsback is the perfect choice for the role of Gein (think Carl from 'Sling Blade' meets Norman Bates and you got the idea) and he brings a sense of pity and childlike innocence to the role. 'Ed Gein' might not have the guttural punch of 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' or the harsh suspense of 'Deranged' (also based on Mr. Gein), but it does one thing and one thing well: it tells the truth.",3,Satisfying little chiller.,999043200,"08 29, 2001",2001,2533,"['Ed', 'Gein', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'prolific', 'serial', 'killers', 'one', 'most', 'imitated', 'Several', 'classic', 'movie', 'maniacs', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'crimes', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Leatherface', ""'Silence"", 'Lambs', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'name', 'few', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'aware', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'inspired', 'slew', 'slasher', 'films', 'also', 'couple', 'heavy', 'metal', 'songs', ""'Dead"", 'Skin', 'Mask', 'Slayer', 'anyone', 'film', 'director', 'Chuck', 'Parello', 'fresh', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick', '2', 'Mask', 'Sanity', 'tries', 'play', 'subject', 'matter', 'straight', 'indeed', 'are', 'fake', 'scares', 'cheap', 'one-liners', 'charismatic', 'killers', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'nubile', 'young', 'coeds', 'serious', 'disturbing', 'character', 'study', 'psychological', 'tale', 'very', 'very', 'deep', 'mind', 'title', 'character', 'Played', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'who', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Manson', ""'Helter"", 'Skelter', 'back', '1976', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'slow-witted', 'child', 'man', 'unable', 'cope', 'passing', 'mother', 'played', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'digging', 'up', 'graves', 'trying', 'resurrect', 'corpses', 'cannibal', 'necrophile', 'movie', 'most', 'jarring', 'scene', 'dressing', 'skin', 'victims', 'violence', 'presented', 'film', 'not', 'terribly', 'explicit', 'instead', 'relying', 'suggestion', 'achieve', 'discomforting', 'effect', 'merits', 'however', 'Gein', 'fails', 'many', 'levels', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'feels', 'under-developed', 'under-acted', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'film', 'documentary', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'devised', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'one', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'involving', 'completely', 'unbelieveable', 'computer', 'generated', 'fire', 'effects', 'illusion', 'reality', 'Parello', 'Co.', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'create', 'Gein', 'triumph', 'rare', 'genre', 'filmmaker', 'Parello', 'chooses', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'so', 'very', 'easily', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'run-of-the-mill', 'blood', 'guts', 'fodder', 'actually', 'informative', 'engrossing', 'tale', 'Railsback', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'Gein', 'think', 'Carl', ""'Sling"", 'Blade', 'meets', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'got', 'idea', 'sense', 'pity', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'role', 'Gein', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'guttural', 'punch', ""'Henry"", 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'harsh', 'suspense', ""'Deranged"", 'also', 'based', 'Mr.', 'Gein', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'well', 'truth']",N/A

In fact, it seems as if the film makers have taken the most dull, predictable, and conservative route that this subject matter has ever seen. If you are a fan of the classics Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, don't even bother wasting your time on Ed Gein. With a few quick edits, this could play on network television. There is absolutely NO shock value or gore. The director spends an inordinate amount of time illustrating Gein's relationship with different town members. This is so boring and no one cares! The fact that the man had SEVERED HEADS hanging from his door and dressed in a body suit of DEAD SKIN are just briefly passed over; and I mean briefly. The reason why people wanted to see a movie about Gein is to know the intimate and sick details of what he actually did to his victims. As a film, Ed Gein is so conservative that the most disturbing part is watching his mother and father gut one of the pigs on the farm. Railsback is decent as Gein but attention to detail is overlooked, like having his mom be rail \-thin when in reality she was heavy. The scene were he kills his older brother is pretty ridiculous too, complete with computer generated fire. All in all, I am still waiting for someone to have the guts to show what actually happened inside of that farmhouse.

662979,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005LC6J,Jeffrey Leach,"[24, 26]","The strange case of cannibal killer and all around fruitcake Ed Gein of Plainfield, Wisconsin makes for an interesting book or movie, although it is not the sort of story you're likely to see as a network feature of the week. We've already seen several films based on the Gein phenomenon, like Robert Bloch's book (and Hitchcock's subsequent film version) ""Psycho"" and Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Neither of these films attempts to tell the real story of Gein's numerous psychopathologies and actual crimes, and no film did until ""Deranged"" came out in the early 1970s. Even that movie, closer to what Ed Gein actually did but still fanciful in respects, couldn't capture the truly depraved incidents that unfolded in Plainfield during the 1950s. Finally, we were told in no uncertain terms, the film ""Ed Gein"" would peel the curtain back and really show us the actual monstrosities of the cannibal killer. Yeah, right. No film will truly show us the behaviors Ed Gein engaged in because no one knows for certain all of the atrocities he committed. Debate still rages today over whether the man was a raving lunatic or a cold, shrewdly intelligent beast fully aware of his actions.Nonetheless, ""Ed Gein"" gives it the old college try. The movie spends a great amount of time examining the odd method of childrearing practiced in the Gein household. His mother Augusta (Carrie Snodgrass) is a woman dedicated to bible thumping and character assassination. The titular character (played by the always reliable Steve Railsback) and his older brother Henry (Brian Evers) spend most of their childhood and a significant amount of their adulthood sitting around Augusta listening to her drone on and on about her favorite biblical passages. Her greatest hits consist of those parts of the holy writings promising to bring justice and vengeance down upon the wicked, and for Augusta Gein the whole world is packed to the rafters with wicked people. Women especially come in for special scorn from this bitter old biddy, and she spends an inordinate amount of time warning her sons to avoid the ""harlots"" living in town. Her vitriol splashes on her husband too, an alcoholic largely reduced to surviving in a household you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. After his passing, Augusta redoubles her efforts to teach the Lord's message to the boys. Henry tires of this nonsense, making plans to marry and move away. That he dies at the hand of his brother Ed during a hunting expedition is something the movie accepts as fact even though no one ever proved it.Once Augusta Gein passes away, the tethers holding Ed to the earth break and drift away. He walls off her room like it is some sort of holy shrine, and he takes up reading books about concentration camp atrocities and primitive religious rituals. At some point Ed starts receiving mental messages from his deceased mother urging him to commit unspeakable atrocities, atrocities involving grave robbing and defilement. An inventive sort of chap, it's nothing for Ed to construct household items out of human bones and flesh after failing to resurrect the deceased through mental telepathy. Hmmm. But just as all human behaviors move to extremes unless checked, Gein's proclivity towards the bizarre soon escalates. Digging up corpses gives way to going out and procuring fresh bodies. Ed murders bar owner Mary Hogan (Sally Champlin) and drags her body back to his house for a whole new round of mayhem, an action fully justified in Gein's mind due to the woman's promiscuity. He later slays a local storeowner, a crime that is his undoing because of his own incompetence: he took the cash register and left a receipt book behind showing that he was the last customer to visit the store. The authorities discover a literal house of horrors when they enter the Gein farmhouse.""Ed Gein"" covers many of the smaller details of the Gein case. The movie even shows us a scene involving the two young boys who would come over to the farmhouse in order to pal around with Ed. On a much grimmer note, a very short scene reveals in horrific detail how Gein would dress up in clothing made from human skin, bang on a drum, and dance around outside at night. As yucky as this last situation is, it's about as horrific as the film gets. There are a few other unnerving sights and sounds, but ""Ed Gein"" is remarkably restrained considering the subject matter. The best aspect of the film has little to do with the gore and everything to do with the acting. Railsback does a good job in the role, capturing perfectly what all the written accounts of the man claimed: that Ed Gein often seemed like a child captured in a man's body. Carrie Snodgrass comes in for special mention, too. The late actress makes Augusta Gein look like the most frightening person on the planet. A few awkward moments in the film, in particular the cheesy CGI fire during Henry's death scene, doesn't take away from the performances turned in by Railsback and Snodgrass.My impression of the movie is that the filmmakers strove to present a character study of this bizarre human being, with special emphasis on how he became such a depraved individual. The film also takes a position in the debate about Gein's mental state, namely that he knew his actions were wrong yet the voice of his mother he frequently heard in his mind overrode his inhibitions. ""Ed Gein"" brings us no closer to solving the enigma surrounding this aberrant person, but it's intriguing in that the movie is the closest thing we have on celluloid detailing his terrible crimes. Gorehounds, however, will probably express disappointment at the lack of grue.",4,"Ed Gein, up close and personal",1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,5656,"['strange', 'case', 'cannibal', 'killer',

The Midwest setting is convincing, however, and Steve Railsback (who played Charles Manson in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;) is excellent as Gein, who grew up with a religious-kook mother (Carrie Snodgress, who poorly imitates Piper Laurie's character in &quot;Carrie&quot;) and views his murders as 'God's good work.'Gein's life story is indeed one worthy of celluloid, but any fans or curiosity seekers will probably be left cold by this film.  The acting is mostly horrible, the flashbacks are unconvincing, and the grisly details are poorly rendered (I blame the low budget for that).  I only give it two stars for Railsback's excellent portrayal, but other than that you'd be better off renting one of the movies I mentioned earlier.",2,Ed Gein deserves better,996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,1319,"['Wisconsin', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'defining', 'figures', 'annals', 'American', 'criminology', 'crimes', 'inspiring', 'such', 'classic', 'films', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'quot', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'quot', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'even', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'more', 'so', 'novel', 'movie', 'point', 'flat-out', 'documentary', 'man', 'almost', 'redundant', 'quot', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'quot', 'least', 'TRIES', 'ultimately', 'fails', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', 'limited', 'low', 'budget', 'incapable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Midwest', 'setting', 'convincing', 'however', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'who', 'played', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'quot', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'quot', 'excellent', 'Gein', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'religious-kook', 'mother', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'who', 'poorly', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'character', 'quot', 'Carrie', 'quot', 'murders', ""'God"", 'good', 'work', 'life', 'story', 'indeed', 'one', 'worthy', 'celluloid', 'fans', 'curiosity', 'seekers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'left', 'cold', 'film', 'acting', 'mostly', 'horrible', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'grisly', 'details', 'are', 'poorly', 'rendered', 'blame', 'low', 'budget', 'only', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'Railsback', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'other', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'renting', 'one', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'earlier']",N/A

All of us are familiar with the story of serial killer Ed Gein, the man who actually penned that phase. We have seen almost all other movies based on his life-&quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; being just a few of the over 40 films. There is nothing really surprising about the film, and hardly anything we, or at least I, didnt already know, but it is engrossing nonetheless....the performances, the screenplay, and just the whole dark mood throughout make it worthwhile. My only complaint was the cheesy fire effects, which looked terrible...however that was one mere second of a film that brilliantly goes inside the head of a brutal serial killer and makes us see just how twisted Ed Gein really was....the film really pleased me. I knew I was going to like it, but I had a feeling that it was going to make me feel sick because of all the twisted things Ed Gein is known for....the violence and the gore are handled with style however and they are all off-screen, much like &quot;American Psycho&quot;, which was also based on the life of Ed Gein...this movie really is terrific and definitely recommended....my friend thought it started off slow, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through....there was not a slow moment throughout the whole movie and at a mere 85 minutes, it was at perfect length....whatever u do, see this movie....it's great....",4,Ed Gein is Great!!!!,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1701,"['whole', 'world', 'was', 'out', 'getting', 'mummified', 'weekend', 'saw', 'impressive', 'low', 'budget', 'shocker', 'instead', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Character', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'title', 'character', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'Forsaken', 'terrific', 'mother', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'penned', 'phase', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'other', 'movies', 'based', 'life-', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'quot', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'quot', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'being', 'just', 'few', '40', 'films', 'nothing', 'really', 'surprising', 'film', 'hardly', 'anything', 'least', 'didnt', 'already', 'know', 'engrossing', 'nonetheless', '.the', 'performances', 'screenplay', 'just', 'whole', 'dark', 'mood', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'cheesy', 'fire', 'effects', 'looked', 'terrible', 'however', 'was', 'one', 'mere', 'second', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'head', 'brutal', 'serial', 'killer', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'twisted', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'really', 'was', '.the', 'film', 'really', 'pleased', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'feel', 'sick', 'twisted', 'things', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'known', '.the', 'violence', 'gore', 'are', 'handled', 'style', 'however', 'are', 'off-screen', 'much', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'life', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'movie', 'really', 'terrific', 'definitely', 'recommended', '.my', 'friend', 'thought', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'way', '.there', 'was', 'not', 'slow', 'moment', 'whole', 'movie', 'mere', '85', 'minutes', 'was', 'perfect', 'length', '.whatever', 'u', 'do', 'see', 'movie', '.it', 'great']",N/A

Nothing is more frightening than what really happens rather than something a scriptwriter makes up.  Ed Gein was just such a man.  And I wasn't disappointed, as this was truly horrifying.Ed was a simple man, a little strange, a little socially maladjusted.  He grew up in a rural community in Wisconsin, with his parents and brother, doing thing that rural people do.  He lead a simple life, a simple life that no one but his mother was there to mold and shape.  Mother Gein spent all her time telling Ed that women were the root of all evil, that so called ""loose"" women would ruin him and his brother, and spent many hours reading the Bible to them.  She used these often misused passages to justify her own views to her kids, and Ed was the one who listened closest.  He was so shocking because he was a real person who lived in a much simpler time than we do now.  He was, after all, the inspiration for Psycho.  No one had ever touched on these things before (as far as we knew) and it certainly wasn't made so public.Perhaps Ed wanted to be a woman.  Perhaps he just wanted free of the love / hate relationship he and all children have with their parents at some point or another.  Maybe he just wanted to be free of the confines he felt his existence was.  Maybe he just wanted to be loved.  Whatever the reason, Ed became a very, very disturbed man who became dangerous.What made this movie so scary was that while we know today that people like him exist among us in the most unlikely of places, Ed lived in a more innocent time when we weren't exposed to the evils of the world so much.  If there were people out there who did the same things that Ed would do, no one knew about them.  He became the first true celebrity serial killer.The only thing this movie neglected to do was show us Ed's life after he was caught and put into a psychiatric hospital for the rest of his life.  Ironically, Ed probably lived better during those years than anytime before.  And maybe, just maybe, he reclaimed some sanity there.  Like Norman Bates (who was later based on Ed) said, after all, ""We all go a little mad from time to time"".",4,You wonder what happens to some people,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,2257,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'horror', 'fan', 'years', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'fascination', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'Nothing', 'more', 'frightening', 'what', 'really', 'rather', 'something', 'scriptwriter', 'up', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'was', 'just', 'such', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'truly', 'horrifying.Ed', 'was', 'simple', 'man', 'little', 'strange', 'little', 'socially', 'maladjusted', 'grew', 'up', 'rural', 'community', 'Wisconsin', 'parents', 'brother', 'doing', 'thing', 'rural', 'people', 'do', 'lead', 'simple', 'life', 'simple', 'life', 'one', 'mother', 'was', 'there', 'mold', 'shape', 'Mother', 'Gein', 'spent', 'time', 'telling', 'Ed', 'women', 'were', 'root', 'evil', 'so', 'called', 'loose', 'women', 'would', 'ruin', 'brother', 'spent', 'many', 'hours', 'reading', 'Bible', 'used', 'often', 'misused', 'passages', 'justify', 'own', 'views', 'kids', 'Ed', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'listened', 'closest', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'much', 'simpler', 'time', 'do', 'now', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Psycho', 'No', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'touched', 'things', 'before', 'as', 'far', 'knew', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'so', 'public.Perhaps', 'Ed', 'wanted', 'be', 'woman', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'wanted', 'free', 'love', '/', 'hate', 'relationship', 'children', 'have', 'parents', 'point', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'free', 'confines', 'felt', 'existence', 'was', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'loved', 'reason', 'Ed', 'became', 'very', 'very', 'disturbed', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'dangerous.What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'scary', 'was', 'know', 'today', 'people', 'exist', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places', 'Ed', 'lived', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'exposed', 'evils', 'world', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'same', 'things', 'Ed', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'knew', 'became', 'first', 'true', 'celebrity', 'serial', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'neglected', 'do', 'was', 'show', 'Ed', 'life', 'was', 'caught', 'put', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'rest', 'life', 'Ironically', 'Ed', 'probably', 'lived', 'better', 'years', 'anytime', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'reclaimed', 'sanity', 'there', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'based', 'Ed', 'said', 'go', 'little', 'mad', 'time', 'time']",N/A

It's a well-made film about a grisly subject, and Messrs.  Parello & Johnson chose to stay away from gory scenes that would seem to accompany such a narrative. That was a relief. It's a good suspense film, with some fine acting, especially Steve Railsback as the doomed Ed, and a great performance from Sally Champlin as the good-time girl bartender. Fine support from all, and I particularly liked Craig Zimmerman as Pete, Ed's drinkin' pal. As a low-budget effort, first released in Germany as ""In the Light of the Moon"", I was quite riveted by the level of intensity that was created. I was 8 years old when I first heard about Ed Gein, and a young mind can absorb a lot. There are terrific inaccuracies regarding the details, but I'm sure the families of those affected had something to do with that. It was the death of hardware store owner Mrs. Worden that finally alerted the police to Gein's capture. Gein was found legally insane and confined to Mendota State Hospital, where he would bay at the moon; I was a student at UW~Madison during that time. References to Gein were commonplace.  As I said, I was aware of Mr. Gein's story, and the film has changed a lot of the facts. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Carrie Snodgrass (as Gein's crazy, abusive Bible-thumping mother). She'd drive anyone over the edge. It's a triumph of control and precision. I've always liked her. It's a good film. Kids probably won't get all the fantasy weirdness, which the director and writer tried to get across. No blood and gore; rather a straight-forward narrative that really should be told. No DVD extras at all, except for a trailer.

But if you want to learn about Ed Gein it' best to stick with books. I watched it after reading Deviant. There are a few things I wanted to comment on. Augusta Gein (Ed's mother) did not love her children or show any emotion towards them. She felt that having children was just part of being married and that it was in God's plan for her. In the movie there were a few parts were Augusta actually cared for her children. I had to wonder about that. Also, Augusta was a intimitading person and was feared by her family. The part where Ed's father hit Augusta doesn't sound right. Ed's father was also an alcholic and very weak (influenced by Augusta). Also it seemed like Ed knew what he was doing. But my assumption of Ed after reading Deviant was that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. This is what I've read. The setting is in Wisconsin. It's too bad they couldn't film in a town where there is snow on the ground. The end does take place in November during deer hunting season. It would've helped this film out a little. This movie is alright if you just want entertainment. But if you want the real good information on Ed Gein it's best to stick with books.

There are many cool scenes in this movie. It's also interesting to know that Ed Gein's story inspired movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Silence of The Lambs and Psycho.We see a lonely, disturbed man who sees visions of his dead mother telling him to kill these women b/c they are all sinners. Ed listens to his mother and kills these women and brings them to his isolated farmhouse and mutilates the victims, making his own suits of human skin, and keeping trophies of his victims.
