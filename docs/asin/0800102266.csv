The Dutch actor is one of my favourites and even a bad movie is good if it has Rutger Hauer in it. This is one of three films with Hauer that I like the most.Nick Parker, blind vietnam vet is taken in by a group of natives and is trained in swordsmenship. He then returns to America many years later trying to find his long lost vietnam buddy (Terry O'quinn from TV's Millenium and Jag)that is being blackmailed in making chemical drugs to a Las Vegas mobster (Noble Willingham from Walker, Texas Ranger). The mobster tries to kidnap his young son (Brandon Call from Baywatch) but the son is rescued by Parker and the two try to get to the boys father.If the movie didn't have such good actors and especially Hauer it would be another acton flick on the shelves of the videostore. The action is good and the actors make the most of the plot but it is the special bond that developes between Hauer and Call as the young boy that works the best. All actors make good, Terry O'quinn is the father that tries to be a hero and save his loved ones but always chickens out. There is only two really unnecessary characters in the film but they are mostly used as the comedians to make up for the two heavies, Noble Willingham as the main mobster and his hitman Slag, a great Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb.",5,Rutger Hauer has Blind Fury,1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,1397,"[""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'give', 'film', 'high', 'rating', ""'m"", 'big', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'fan', 'Dutch', 'actor', 'one', 'favourites', 'even', 'bad', 'movie', 'good', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'one', 'three', 'films', 'Hauer', 'like', 'most.Nick', 'Parker', 'vietnam', 'vet', 'taken', 'group', 'natives', 'trained', 'swordsmenship', 'then', 'America', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'trying', 'find', 'long', 'lost', 'vietnam', 'buddy', 'Terry', ""O'quinn"", 'TV', 'Millenium', 'Jag', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'making', 'chemical', 'drugs', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'mobster', 'Noble', 'Willingham', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'mobster', 'kidnap', 'young', 'son', 'Brandon', 'Call', 'Baywatch', 'son', 'rescued', 'Parker', 'two', 'try', 'get', 'boys', 'father.If', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'good', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hauer', 'would', 'be', 'acton', 'flick', 'shelves', 'videostore', 'action', 'good', 'actors', 'make', 'most', 'plot', 'special', 'bond', 'Hauer', 'Call', 'young', 'boy', 'best', 'actors', 'make', 'good', 'Terry', ""O'quinn"", 'father', 'be', 'hero', 'save', 'loved', 'ones', 'always', 'out', 'only', 'two', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'mostly', 'used', 'comedians', 'make', 'up', 'two', 'heavies', 'Noble', 'Willingham', 'main', 'mobster', 'hitman', 'Slag', 'great', 'Randall', 'quot', 'Tex', 'quot', 'Cobb']",N/A

His name is Brandon Call and I remember seeing him in several films of the time, but unfortunately he did not make the crossover to adult star.

160672,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,0800102266,Israel Drazin,"[3, 3]","This delightful action film with a few humorous scenes is probably one of Rudger Hauer's best acting. An American soldier (Hauer) is blinded during the Vietnam War when he was left alone by his buddy, Frank, who ran cowardly when the Vietnamese opened fire. Friendly Vietnamese find him wondering blindly in the woods, take him to their village, teach him how to move about and act even though he is blind, and how to use a samurai sword concealed in a cane. They also help him improve his sense of hearing. Hauer becomes so proficient that he can hear an insect flying, know exactly where it is flying, draw his sword, slice it, and cut it in two.  Hauer is not depressed by his condition and feels good about himself.Twenty years later, Hauer is walking on a Florida street, and we see him save a woman from several thugs by beating them with his cane. Then, in another episode, he stops three people from kidnapping a boy and his mother, although the thugs kill the mother. Before she dies, she begs Hauer to take her son to his father, whom she divorced, who is in Nevada. The father is Hauer's old buddy who abandoned him. Unknown to Hauer at the time, the thugs tried to kidnap Frank's family to force him to make drugs for them. Hauer now need to fight against many criminals.Viewers will see scenes where blind Hauer fights large numbers of armed thugs, the slowly developing strong love relationship between Hauer and Frank's son Billy, how Hauer deals with Frank who abandoned him, how he deals with his love for Billy, and the occasional humor, such as when Hauer slashes a thug with unusual precision, he says, ""I also do circumcisions.""",5,An excellently acted thriller,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,1649,"['delightful', 'action', 'film', 'few', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'probably', 'one', 'Rudger', 'Hauer', 'best', 'acting', 'American', 'soldier', 'Hauer', 'blinded', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'when', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'buddy', 'Frank', 'who', 'ran', 'cowardly', 'when', 'Vietnamese', 'opened', 'fire', 'Friendly', 'Vietnamese', 'find', 'wondering', 'blindly', 'woods', 'take', 'village', 'teach', 'how', 'move', 'about', 'act', 'even', 'blind', 'how', 'use', 'samurai', 'sword', 'concealed', 'cane', 'also', 'help', 'improve', 'sense', 'hearing', 'Hauer', 'so', 'proficient', 'can', 'hear', 'insect', 'flying', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'flying', 'draw', 'sword', 'slice', 'cut', 'two', 'Hauer', 'not', 'depressed', 'condition', 'feels', 'good', 'himself.Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Hauer', 'walking', 'Florida', 'street', 'see', 'save', 'woman', 'several', 'thugs', 'beating', 'cane', 'Then', 'episode', 'three', 'people', 'kidnapping', 'boy', 'mother', 'thugs', 'kill', 'mother', 'Hauer', 'take', 'son', 'father', 'whom', 'divorced', 'who', 'Nevada', 'father', 'Hauer', 'old', 'buddy', 'who', 'abandoned', 'Unknown', 'Hauer', 'time', 'thugs', 'tried', 'kidnap', 'Frank', 'family', 'force', 'make', 'drugs', 'Hauer', 'now', 'need', 'fight', 'many', 'criminals.Viewers', 'will', 'see', 'scenes', 'where', 'blind', 'Hauer', 'fights', 'large', 'numbers', 'armed', 'thugs', 'slowly', 'developing', 'strong', 'love', 'relationship', 'Hauer', 'Frank', 'son', 'Billy', 'how', 'Hauer', 'deals', 'Frank', 'who', 'abandoned', 'how', 'love', 'Billy', 'occasional', 'humor', 'such', 'when', 'Hauer', 'thug', 'unusual', 'precision', 'also', 'do', 'circumcisions']",N/A

Some years later, Nick travels back to America to meet up with fellow Vietnam soldier Frank Devereaux (Terry O'Quinn).  What he sees, however, is a dire blackmail situation with Las Vegas mobsters in which Frank's wife gets some new ventilation courtesy of a shotgun blast from a cigar chomping Randall ""Tex"" Cobb.  After carving up the thugs with his razor sharp sword - hidden inconspicuously in a walking cane - he protects Frank's young son Billy on a journey towards his father in Las Vegas.If the concept of a blind swordmaster taking on the mob and battling groups of men with submachine-guns isn't hokey enough for you, then you won't like this movie.  It's supposed to be tongue in cheek fun, and director Phillip Noyce cements the purpose with a few corny lines and snide comments about blindness from Rutger Hauer.  I'm almost surprised his blind character didn't break the fourth wall and wink at the camera.A body count upwards of 20 doesn't necessarily make this a gory or bloody movie.  If this were remade today (please please please) there would be fountains of blood rocketing out of severed arms, hands, and torsos; it would resemble the free flowing blood volcanoes of Japanese films.  Being 1989, however, and required to adhere to limits that have definitely been stretched thin in recent years, the arterial spray and viscera are disappointingly left to a minimum.Pulse-pounding action and a solid lead character makes the 86 minute run time fly by quick enough that a viewer has no need to check his watch (like the one Nick pointlessly wears in the movie).  The movie's tone is typified by the obligatory ""blind guy driving""-scene; it's pretty hilarious.A little dated, but overall a worthy 80s action flick.Jason Elin",4,"If not already taken, ""Vision Quest"" would have been a great title",1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,1925,"['explosive', 'blast', 'blinds', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'Nick', 'Parker', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'benevolent', 'native', 'village', 'adopts', 'become', 'grandmaster', 'sword-wielding', 'pseudo-samurai', 'years', 'later', 'Nick', 'back', 'America', 'meet', 'up', 'fellow', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'Frank', 'Devereaux', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'What', 'however', 'dire', 'blackmail', 'situation', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'mobsters', 'Frank', 'wife', 'new', 'ventilation', 'courtesy', 'shotgun', 'blast', 'cigar', 'chomping', 'Randall', 'Tex', 'Cobb', 'carving', 'up', 'thugs', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sword', 'hidden', 'inconspicuously', 'walking', 'cane', 'Frank', 'young', 'son', 'Billy', 'journey', 'father', 'Las', 'Vegas.If', 'concept', 'blind', 'swordmaster', 'taking', 'mob', 'battling', 'groups', 'men', 'submachine-guns', ""n't"", 'hokey', 'enough', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'fun', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'purpose', 'few', 'corny', 'lines', 'snide', 'comments', 'blindness', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', ""'m"", 'almost', 'surprised', 'blind', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'fourth', 'wall', 'wink', 'camera.A', 'body', 'count', 'upwards', '20', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'gory', 'bloody', 'movie', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'please', 'please', 'please', 'would', 'be', 'fountains', 'blood', 'rocketing', 'severed', 'arms', 'hands', 'torsos', 'would', 'resemble', 'free', 'flowing', 'blood', 'volcanoes', 'Japanese', 'films', 'Being', '1989', 'however', 'required', 'adhere', 'limits', 'have', 'definitely', 'been', 'stretched', 'thin', 'recent', 'years', 'arterial', 'spray', 'viscera', 'are', 'disappointingly', 'left', 'minimum.Pulse-pounding', 'action', 'solid', 'lead', 'character', '86', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'fly', 'quick', 'enough', 'viewer', 'need', 'check', 'watch', 'one', 'Nick', 'pointlessly', 'movie', 'movie', 'tone', 'typified', 'obligatory', 'guy', 'driving', '-scene', 'pretty', 'hilarious.A', 'little', 'dated', 'worthy', '80s', 'action', 'flick.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

It has a lot of humor, but also sadness and drama, and some very exciting action sequences (nothing graphic).  There are a few curse words, but they're actually employed in such a way to add to the humor of the film (and I'm no fan of four-letter words).",5,Blind Justice,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,641,"['only', 'fury', ""'ll"", 'see', '34', 'Blind', 'Fury', '34', 'ineffective', 'villains', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'blind', 'ex-soldier', 'calm', 'quirky', 'wiz', 'Samurai', 'sword', 'helping', 'young', 'son', 'army', 'buddy', 'who', 'being', 'pursued', 'drug-dealing', 'baddies', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'PG-13', 'really', 'own', 'sort', 'vibe', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'akin', '34', 'Witness', '34', 'lot', 'humor', 'also', 'sadness', 'drama', 'very', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'are', 'few', 'curse', 'words', ""'re"", 'actually', 'employed', 'such', 'way', 'add', 'humor', 'film', ""'m"", 'fan', 'four-letter', 'words']",N/A
