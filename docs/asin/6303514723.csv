Stephen King's name an reputation are most likely what drew people to the movie when it first aired on cable tv in 1995, and what still stands today is not the praise over grand performances, but rather the clever plot. 9 passengers and one pilot who fall asleep on a commercial airline flight, suddenly find themselves in a time-warp, with many questions to be answered and not enough time to answer them. Its nieve to say that the movie keeps you watching to see what happens next, but watching the 10 time-stranded passengers figure out how to escape possible vanishing from existence is all it takes to keep you interested. Stephen King backs up every scenerio with simple but clever obstacles that the cast must overcome...and as you realize why time is critical in their situation, then you will get to know the Langoliers. The cast is well done for this movie, Mark Lindsay Chapman (Nick Hopewell) is pretty much 1995's answer to todays' Russel Crowe. His character is rather annoying at times but interesting to watch. Dean Stockwell is the &quot;philosophical answer man&quot; so to speak, who's character as you will see is the most critical in finding the hiddin clues in their journey. Kimber Riddle, a never before seen cutty plays one of the two young people in the group, who basically assist the others in working on getting out of their predicament. Bronson Pinchot plays Craig Toomey, a disturbed buisness man who is driven by intimidating voices of his dead father, and who winds up a key element in the group's survival. And a few familiar faces appear in the cast as well. The movies' not about a lot of action, but King is well known for working around that and making a good movie. The movie again is about four hours long...but if you ask me it was easier to sit through than &quot;Titanic&quot;.",4,"The Story Will Do the Work, Not the Acting",984614400,"03 15, 2001",2001,1915,"['four', 'hour', 'movie', 'quot', 'Langoliers', 'quot', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'easy', 'sit', 'Stephen', 'King', 'name', 'reputation', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'what', 'drew', 'people', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'cable', 'tv', '1995', 'what', 'still', 'today', 'not', 'praise', 'grand', 'performances', 'rather', 'clever', 'plot', '9', 'passengers', 'one', 'pilot', 'who', 'fall', 'asleep', 'commercial', 'airline', 'flight', 'suddenly', 'find', 'time-warp', 'many', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'answer', 'nieve', 'say', 'movie', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'watching', '10', 'time-stranded', 'passengers', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'possible', 'vanishing', 'existence', 'keep', 'interested', 'Stephen', 'King', 'backs', 'up', 'scenerio', 'simple', 'clever', 'obstacles', 'cast', 'must', 'overcome', 'realize', 'why', 'time', 'critical', 'situation', 'then', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'Langoliers', 'cast', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Lindsay', 'Chapman', 'Nick', 'Hopewell', 'pretty', 'much', '1995', 'answer', 'todays', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'character', 'rather', 'annoying', 'times', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'quot', 'philosophical', 'answer', 'man', 'quot', 'so', 'speak', 'who', 'character', 'will', 'see', 'most', 'critical', 'finding', 'hiddin', 'clues', 'journey', 'Kimber', 'Riddle', 'never', 'seen', 'cutty', 'one', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'group', 'who', 'basically', 'assist', 'others', 'working', 'getting', 'predicament', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'disturbed', 'buisness', 'man', 'who', 'driven', 'intimidating', 'voices', 'dead', 'father', 'who', 'up', 'key', 'element', 'group', 'survival', 'few', 'familiar', 'appear', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'movies', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'King', 'well', 'known', 'working', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'again', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'ask', 'was', 'easier', 'sit', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot']",Langoliers VHS

Now the logic of this story never was very strong, so when you lose the character depth of it, you lose the whole deal...On top of that - the performances were very unconvincing (why does S.

Not a perfect film by any means (CGI effects are cartoonish), but it does follow Roger Corman's #1 rule of monster movies: build up anticipation as long as possible before showing the creature(s).The plot's intriguing: ten passengers on a jam-packed jet flying non-stop from L.A. to Boston awake in the middle of the night to discover that all the other passengers and the flight crew have vanished, leaving behind personal possessions like jewelry, pocket change, false teeth, Walkmen, watches (all stopped at 7 after 4), reading material, etc. Fortunately for those still on the plane, among them is an off-duty airline pilot (David Morse). After the cockpit door's forced open, he takes the captain's seat.When there's no answer on any radio frequency it soon becomes apparent that everyone on the ground has also disappeared. Stress from this dilemma is worsened by one self-important loudmouth (Bronson Pinchot) who won't stop screaming about the necessity of making a 9 am meeting in Boston. Only the threat of violence from other passengers shuts him up, but this cold sweating paranoiac is sure to cause more trouble.Also on the plane: a burly tool & die maker (Frankie Faison), a teen girl (Kimber Riddle) sent East to a rehab, a young man (Christopher Collet) who's off to college on a violin scholarship, a blind girl of about 12 (Kate Maberly) hoping that an operation will restore her eyesight, a fifth grade schoolteacher (Patricia Wettig) who becomes the child's guardian, a chubby guy (Baxter Harris) who's first and last thought is of food, a mystery writer (Dean Stockwell) that's obviously King's surrogate (his surmises advance the story) and a secretive, take-charge kind of felllow with a British accent (Mark Lindsay Chapman) who assists the pilot and also helps maintain order. As the story progresses we learn details of each person's life, and there's some pairing off, romantic or otherwise.As they fly cross-country above an unending cloud cover, questions remain. Where did everybody else go? Why were these few left behind? What will be found once they reach their destination and will they even be able to land safely?If you're a fan of Stephen King screen adaptations or of good mystery stories, THE LANGOLIERS is really worth seeing.",4,"""We know what happens to today when it becomes yesterday...

Suspense, drama, horror, comedy, family films, you name it.  But the Langoliers is probably one of my very favorite films.When this film first came out in the mid 90's, I was addicted to it.  I would go over to my aunt's house every weekend and watch it.  What made it so addicting to me, you wonder?  I've always had an obsession with the thought of wondering if somewhere in the universe a world EXACTLY like this one existed.  BUT, if there was a way we could somehow arrive to that mirror world, would EVERYTHING be exactly the same?  Wouldn't some things be different?  Wouldn't it be fun to figure out the things that make that world different from the one we've lived on for years?The Langoliers is almost like that game where someone shows you two almost-identical pictures and you have to find the one minor thing that makes them different from each other.  That's a good way of explaining the point of this film.  To me, this is something EXTREMELY fascinating.  Imagine if I could somehow travel to another world exactly like Earth where all the continents and oceans are located in the same exact place, and arrive to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Something about the city isn't quite right.  What's wrong?Let's say, just like in the film, as I go around exploring the city in my attempt to figure out the difference between this abandoned and unsettling Philadelphia compared to the Philadelphia I grew up in, I keep hearing strange sounds in the background, and I have no idea what it is.  Wouldn't that be scary?  The sounds continue nonstop, and they get louder and louder as *something* gets closer and closer.  I have to hurry up and find a way out of there, because it dawns on me that this Philadelphia is actually a nightmare version of the real thing.  It turns out nobody lives in this nightmare Philadelphia, even though all the buildings and bridges are still standing exactly like they were in the real world.  But what's going on?In the case of the movie, everything takes place at an airport.  Nobody is around, and the main characters continue to hear strange sounds in the background as they try to discover what's wrong.

The movie delves even deeper, showing just how funny people can be when faced with eminent destruction.Both the movie and the book ask the question, ""What would you do if you fell asleep on an airplane, but everybody that was awake, died, and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath, and another is a blind girl who can sense evil, kind of like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", then you seek shelter in an airport, but all the carbonated drinks are flat and the food is spoiled, then you find out that these Pac-Man-like creatures (""the Langoliers"") literally consume the past?""Well, what would you do?It's a tricky question, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I would do.  But I can tell one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that's quite a departure from his beloved Balki Bartokomous character on the popular TV show, ""Perfect Strangers"") doesn't know how to answer the question either.  Man, does he go crazy - and I'm not talking Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"" crazy - I mean he goes REALLY crazy.  You can tell that Pinchot really embraced this role for what it was and took method acting to an entirely new level.Still not convinced?  After all the laughs and slapstick routines (the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks the beer in the airport is absolutely brilliant!), you are treated to a fantastic, suspenseful chase scene where the Langoliers chase the speeding plane down the runaway.

378545,A1FELYY4UPE78M,6303514723,Chris R. Call,"[3, 3]","4.5/5 The best parts of 'The Langoliers' are the acting and the directing. This never feels like a TV show. It feels like a solid theatrical release that is at times, inspired.This isn't perfect of course, but the only flaws that stick out like a sore thumb are a few odd lines of flat dialogue. This all adds up to about 3 or 4 minutes of drag out of a three hour release. This is important, as 'The Langoliers' is all dialogue, like a stage play. In fact, this could be made into a stage play with little effort. So the fact that the dialogue is almost entirely solid is very important. It is not the best you will ever hear in film, but it is good enough, that top level acting talent will make it great. That is, fortunately, exactly what 'The Langoliers' has in David Morse, Dean Stockwell, and particularily Bronson Pinchot, who deserved an Emmy for his performance. His character stole the show throughout, and his scenes in particular, were the most inspired here.The directing is fantastic, though my only qualm is that airplanes land with the head pointing up, not down. Also, people have criticized the characters for standing at times too long before taking action. I offer that people really do stand around in shock when faced with a traumatising experience. It never gets drawn out too long, and someone is always there to shake the character into sense. Otherwise, the director and camera people make this feel like a theatrical release at the A level rather than some low budget TV episode. The visual representation is at times inspired at a level of 'The Shawshank Redemption', though particularily surrounding the Craig Toomy character and in portraying an empty world.The driving point about your enjoyment of 'The Langoliers' sits squarely in the believability factor. It has a particular take on time travel that you must be able to accept, or you will start finding sillyness in the film. It doesn't need to be a true take on time travel, just a creative one IMO, and 'The Langoliers' is creative. This film manages to explain its theories rather well, so true or not, it understands the ideas it presents. Is this as good as 'The Shawshank redemption' or 'The Green Mile'? I have a very hard time making that comparison. It's in a category of its own.In closing, Bronson Pinchot puts on one of the most fantastic acting performances I have ever seen in a motion picture. Chances are, even if this film is not in your interest, you will appreciate his performance.

It holds you from start to finish, as most King stories do.I do have a few minor complaints, though. Like the old classic ""Curse of the Demon"", this film would have been much more effective if we never actually saw the langoliers (who reminded me of the animated scrub brushes in cleansing powder commercials), but left us to wonder whether or not they were part of Toomey's imagination.  I have never read the book, but it seemed to me that Toomey should have been a more sympathetic character, and why-oh-why did the Irishmen-pretending-to-be-an-Englishman come across sounding like an Australian?  I was also bothered by the fact that these people were returned to the Present, but no inquiries were made as to the whereabouts of all those missing passengers, not to mention the dead girl in the plane.

Almost inexplicably, it has become one of my favorite Stephen King miniseries.  The plot has a couple of holes big enough to consume the giant time rip that causes all the problems in the first place, and the actors overplay their characters almost to a man, but the concept of the ""langoliers"" themselves lends a fresh little twist to the sometimes hackneyed concept of time travel.David Morse outshines the rest of the cast in his role as Captain Engle, although Bronson Pinchot (in quite a breakout role for him at the time) is wonderful (albeit irritating) as the deranged Craig Toomey.  Pinchot really goes for all the stops in making his character as noticeable and loud as possible, and he begins to learn the secrets of making your face reflect madness toward the end.  The quirky Dean Stockwell is another overactor here; playing a mystery writer, he hems and haws, striking Rodin's Thinker-like poses all over the place, invigorating even his most trivial comments with a sense of dire importance.  Mark Lindsey Chapman is not bad, nor is Patricia Wettig.  Kate Maberly plays the young blind girl Dinah; this character has the distinction of being the most annoying character I have ever encountered.  I earnestly dislike her character, which makes my fondness for this movie so surprising to me.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Stephen King's appearance; it is one of his best cameos ever, in my opinion.  He plays a bank president, but his appearance can only be described as cheesy, reminding me somewhat of the character he played in Creepshow.DVD technology actually detracts from this movie somewhat; the langoliers, when they finally arrive, look much cheesier than they originally appeared on television and VHS.  This does not really harm the story, though.  Despite its flaws, it is a story I find fascinating.  This movie is probably a little long for some people's taste, coming in at three hours; despite its length, character development actually leaves something to be desired.  Some of the dialogue is rather forced, as well.  Thus, I can easily see why some folks don't jump up and down praising The Langoliers, but somehow it manages to entertain and intrigue me every time I watch it.  It offers an unusual twist to the done-to-death subject of time travel, and I think that is what keeps me coming back.",5,One of my favorite King miniseries,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,2423,"['reason', 'find', 'watching', 'Langoliers', 'again', 'few', 'months', 'Almost', 'inexplicably', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'miniseries', 'plot', 'couple', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'consume', 'giant', 'time', 'rip', 'problems', 'first', 'place', 'actors', 'overplay', 'characters', 'almost', 'man', 'concept', 'langoliers', 'fresh', 'little', 'twist', 'sometimes', 'hackneyed', 'concept', 'time', 'travel.David', 'Morse', 'rest', 'cast', 'role', 'Captain', 'Engle', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'quite', 'breakout', 'role', 'time', 'wonderful', 'irritating', 'deranged', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'Pinchot', 'really', 'stops', 'making', 'character', 'noticeable', 'loud', 'possible', 'learn', 'secrets', 'making', 'face', 'reflect', 'madness', 'end', 'quirky', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'overactor', 'here', 'playing', 'mystery', 'writer', 'haws', 'striking', 'Rodin', 'Thinker-like', 'poses', 'place', 'invigorating', 'even', 'most', 'trivial', 'comments', 'sense', 'dire', 'importance', 'Mark', 'Lindsey', 'Chapman', 'not', 'bad', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'young', 'blind', 'girl', 'Dinah', 'character', 'distinction', 'being', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'earnestly', 'character', 'fondness', 'movie', 'so', 'surprising', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'failed', 'mention', 'Stephen', 'King', 'appearance', 'one', 'best', 'cameos', 'ever', 'opinion', 'bank', 'president', 'appearance', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'cheesy', 'reminding', 'somewhat', 'character', 'played', 'Creepshow.DVD', 'technology', 'actually', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'langoliers', 'when', 'finally', 'arrive', 'look', 'much', 'cheesier', 'originally', 'appeared', 'television', 'VHS', 'not', 'really', 'harm', 'story', 'though', 'flaws', 'story', 'find', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'probably', 'little', 'long', 'people', 'taste', 'coming', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'character', 'development', 'actually', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'forced', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'praising', 'Langoliers', 'somehow', 'entertain', 'intrigue', 'time', 'watch', 'unusual', 'twist', 'done-to-death', 'subject', 'time', 'travel', 'think', 'what', 'coming', 'back']",Langoliers VHS

378552,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,6303514723,David J. Brown,"[2, 2]","This min-series came out way back 1995, after a string of highly rated King T.V. movies(It, The Stand, The Tommyknockers, Sometimes They Come Back).  This film isn't as good as The Stand or It, but it's about as good as The Tommyknockers.It comes from a short story contained in King's book Four Past Midnight.  And you can tell that the plot was stretched to fit a two night mini-series and what ended up being a three hour film on DVD.  The problem with this adaption is that there's way too much exposition on a story that ultimately would've made a really good episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  Dean Stockwell plays a mystery novelist and he has no character to play beyond that of Mr. Exposition.  It's a credit to the actor that his performance is fairly engrossing and likeable considering his only function is to explain the plot and weird goings-on.Actually, the acting in this film is all good.  David Morse is a very underrated actor and he does well in these type of ensemble pieces(he was also in the film adaption of King's Hearts Of Atlantis).  Bronson Pinchott gets to steal all the scenes he's in with the usual King psycho with daddy issues.  He's much more frightening then the title creatures when they finally arrive towards the beginning of the third act.  Special notice must also be given to Mark Lindsay Chapman as a British 'cleaner'.  He has the most complex and interesting character in the story and his arc, while slightly predictable, is very satisfying and well performed.The film was directed by Tom Holland(Fright Night, Child's Play, The Temp, Thinner).  He does a good job in getting fine performances from the cast and he keeps the pace moving despite the over-long running time for the thin story, but he doesn't fare as well in the screenwriting duties.  The film just feels over-long, and the adaption stretch marks really show, especially when watching it in one sitting without the two night mini-series break up.  There's some clunky dialogue here and there, and certain characters just seem to be in the film to be part of a body count.  Hell, he even committs the age old horror cliche' of having the black character bite the dust first.  The film isn't really scary.  It's plot is more Sci-Fi, even though there are monsters afoot in the plot.The monsters are unfortunate.  All throughout cinema it's been an old addage that monsters are more scary off screen then when they're on, and it's always smart to keep them in the shadows for as long as possible(Jaws and Alien are two really good examples of this).  Holland keeps his time eating critters off screen for most of the film's running time.  They work when they're just noises in the background getting louder, and when only their effect on the universe the film takes place in is seen.  So, the monsters show up and they don't live up to what your imagination sees, but it's even worse, they are some of the worst computer generated creature ever committed to celluloid.  I can't be too harsh on the visual effects in this film, it was the mid-90's and this was a television movie, but these things aren't even a good conceptual design let alone a believable special effect.  Luckily, I'm still equiped with my imagination and don't need pristine and super realistic special effects to appreciate a good story.  Did you hear that George Lucas? Screw the modern brain-dead video game addicted youth audiences, just write a good story and the rest will fall into place.The disc itself is nothing to rave about.  Mine is the Canadian release.  It's full frame, but I'm not sure if this film was ever intended to be in widescreen.  Plus, the full frame formatt seems appropriate and all the compositions seems to be designed for it.  The transfer is decent.  You only get some grain in the stock shots of airports, landscapes and flying air planes.  You can tell that they were filmed on a different stock then the bulk of the film.  Luckily, the whole mini-series is on one side of the disc, unlike It or Storm Of The Century.  Also, all the commerical breaks have been smoothed over and edited out of the film so it flows evenly.  I really wish some other min-series, especially King min-series, would've done the same.  DVD editions of The Shining, The Stand and Rose Red are loaded with special features but don't edit out the commerical pauses.  It's really disconcerting that a bare bones affair like The Langoliers went to the trouble for this but the bigger releases of the above mentioned don't.So, if you have a long attention span and can overlook some long expositional scenes, and you don't require your special effects to be so hi-tech that you lie yourself into believing that they are real, then this is a decent time waster.  But, I would recommend reading the short story.  It's more to the point and its concepts involving time travel are truly novel and unlike anything I've read on the subject.",3,Stephen King Review # 3,1243641600,"05 30,

378554,AI9DVL2HA416N,6303514723,Doug Jones,"[3, 5]","This film presents an interesting perspective on the unlikely possibility of passing though a &quot;time rip&quot; and what that might be like.  Unfortunately, it is basically a Stephen King short story that that has been put on a medieval rack and cruelly stretched into a full length movie.  Nine passengers and a pilot wake up from naps to find themselves alone on a jet.  They land at (where else?) Bangor, Maine, and find the airport is deserted.  As they attempt to figure out what has happened, it becomes clear that they are in grave danger and must depart the airport or be killed by whatever has taken everybody else.  As time goes on, the danger increases, time becomes shorter, anxiety rises, and real tension is building.  At least for the audience.  The characters in the story are too busy talking to take the danger seriously.  I found myself wanting to yell at the TV screen &quot;Quit standing around talking to each other and get out of there, you idiots!&quot;  It's not their fault, of course.  In the absence of any interesting imagery (until the last 5 minutes of the movie), the story line can only be stretched out to movie length with lots and lots and lots of dialogue.  Even in the climactic scene, when a horrible death is imminent for all of them if they don't hurry, they stand around talking, and watching the destruction as it approaches, which is something only a person with one lone kernel of candy corn for a brain would do.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Time travel is usually depicted as big, adventurous trips to the past or the future, usually with convenient historical figures.But there's nothing so glamorous about the time travel in ""The Langoliers,"" an eerie Stephen King miniseries about a plane that lands in a strange deserted world. The beginning, buildup and the climax are brilliantly spooky, but there are long stretches of people just standing around talking, and the aforementioned climax is way too early.A plane is en route from L.A. to Boston, when almost all the passengers vanish. The only remaining people are a pair of teenagers, a bereaved pilot, a blind child, a schoolteacher, a mystery writer, an engineer, a businessman, and a psychotic yuppie. They manage to land the plane in a Maine airport (OF COURSE!), but find it similarly deserted.But something is terribly wrong with the place -- clocks have stopped, food tastes flat, and all their surroundings look dull. Even worse, there's a faint roaring in the distance that is growing louder. As the passengers struggle to figure out how to return to normal, the ""langoliers"" (as Psycho-Yuppie Craig Toomey calls them) are approaching the airport. If they don't escape soon, they'll be devoured alive...""The Langoliers"" is a story that probably could have benefited from at least a third of its bulk being chopped off -- the beginning is wonderfully spooky, the climactic clash with the langoliers is pretty freaky (even if they do look like giant raisins with sandworm mouths), and King's depiction of time travel is chillingly nightmarish even WITHOUT the langoliers.But a lot of the middle section is just the characters wandering around the airport, speculating about what they can/can't do. It feels saggy and boring, and even Toomey's periodic violent attacks on the other passengers doesn't spice things up. And the last half hour is... well, kind of anticlimactic. Dramatic, but after the sudden appearance of the langoliers, it feels kind of letdownish.Additionally, there are some basic continuity errors (so, guns don't work but knives do?), and  the idea of the mystery writer being able to unravel the EXACT NATURE of everything that's going on stretches credibility to the shattering point. I know he's a stand-in for King, but COME ON.As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. David Morse gives a good understated performance as the beleagured pilot, Mark Lindsay Chapman has a lot of charisma as a British hit-man with a heart of gold, and Bronson Pinchot gives a freakily over-the-top performance as a businessman who tumbles over the edge of insanity. Most of the others are either underused (Frankie Faison, Dean Stockwell) or downright annoying (everyone else).""The Langoliers"" is an interesting idea handled rather clumsily, especially since it has a rather soggy middle section.

378558,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6303514723,Erik North,"[3, 3]","When one considers the anxiety that people have when travelling on a plane, plus the fascination many have with the idea of time travel, and then a master like Stephen King should combine the two into a story like ""The Langoliers"", it should come as little surprise that the 2-part made-for-TV movie adaptation of that novella (from King's collection ""Four Past Midnight"") should be the single best adaptation of anything in King's oevure to be put on the small screen.  It's not quite the blazing masterpiece of psychological tension and horror that big-screen King adaptations like CARRIE and THE SHINING were, but it does well enough for itself.The story involves the saga of American Eagle Flight 93, heading from Los Angeles to Boston.  At some point during the flight, all but a few passengers onboard mysteriously vanish without a trace.  Those that are left over, including an American Airlines pilot (David Morse) are left to wonder what's happened, and what to do about it.  But doing either becomes no easy task when they risk an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, only to find the place deserted, the clocks not moving, the air completely still, and a monstrous force after them.  There's also the matter of their psychopathic passenger Craig Toomey (Bronson Pinchot, in a performance that makes Jack Nicholson's arguably over-the-top performance in THE SHINING look restrained by comparison), plus the theory, later proven to be true, raised by a mystery writer (Dean Stockwell) onboard, that the plane somehow travelled through a ""time rip.""  The suspense of THE LANGOLIERS is predicated on how this intrepid group can fly back through the ""time rip"" to Los Angeles, and not get eaten alive by the monstrous force of the film's title.As said before, the story would have lent itself to an adaptation, television or otherwise, just on the basis of combining time travel intrigue and air travel anxiety; throw in some added hysteria and paranoia, and the result is pure King mastery.  Although Pinchot's, and occasionally Stockwell's, overacting are drawbacks, they are minimized by the very concept of the story, adapted by director Tom Holland, and the very good acting by Morse as the by-the-book pilot, and Patricia Wettig.  The visual effects work is superior for a television adaptation, and the film also features a witty Hitchcockian cameo for King as a business executive ghost whose haunting of Pinchot is the basis for Pinchot's psychopathic behavior.All in all, given how often King has found his works adapted for both big and small screen, THE LANGOLIERS seems hugely refreshing, and is, despite its flaws, consistently suspenseful in the manner of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits.""",4,Rip Through Time Via Stephen King's Imagination,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,2719,"['When', 'one', 'anxiety', 'people', 'have', 'when', 'travelling', 'plane', 'fascination', 'many', 'have', 'idea', 'time', 'travel', 'then', 'master', 'Stephen', 'King', 'should', 'combine', 'two', 'story', 'Langoliers', 'should', 'come', 'little', 'surprise', '2-part', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'novella', 'King', 'collection', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'should', 'be', 'single', 'best', 'adaptation', 'anything', 'King', 'oevure', 'be', 'put', 'small', 'screen', 'not', 'quite', 'blazing', 'masterpiece', 'psychological', 'tension', 'horror', 'big-screen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'CARRIE', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'were', 'well', 'enough', 'itself.The', 'story', 'saga', 'American', 'Eagle', 'Flight', '93', 'heading', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Boston', 'point', 'flight', 'few', 'passengers', 'onboard', 'mysteriously', 'vanish', 'trace', 'are', 'left', 'over', 'including', 'American', 'Airlines', 'pilot', 'David', 'Morse', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'do', 'doing', 'easy', 'task', 'when', 'risk', 'emergency', 'landing', 'Bangor', 'Maine', 'only', 'find', 'place', 'deserted', 'clocks', 'not', 'moving', 'air', 'completely', 'still', 'monstrous', 'force', 'also', 'matter', 'psychopathic', 'passenger', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'arguably', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'look', 'restrained', 'comparison', 'theory', 'later', 'proven', 'be', 'true', 'raised', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'onboard', 'plane', 'somehow', 'travelled', 'time', 'rip', 'suspense', 'THE', 'LANGOLIERS', 'predicated', 'how', 'intrepid', 'group', 'can', 'fly', 'back', 'time', 'rip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'not', 'get', 'eaten', 'alive', 'monstrous', 'force', 'film', 'title.As', 'said', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'lent', 'adaptation', 'television', 'otherwise', 'just', 'basis', 'combining', 'time', 'travel', 'intrigue', 'air', 'travel', 'anxiety', 'throw', 'added', 'hysteria', 'paranoia', 'result', 'pure', 'King', 'mastery', 'Pinchot', 'occasionally', 'Stockwell', 'overacting', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'minimized', 'very', 'concept', 'story', 'adapted', 'director', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'Morse', 'by-the-book', 'pilot', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'visual', 'effects', 'work', 'superior', 'television', 'adaptation', 'film', 'also', 'witty', 'Hitchcockian', 'cameo', 'King', 'business', 'executive', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'Pinchot', 'basis', 'Pinchot', 'psychopathic', 'behavior.All', 'given', 'how', 'often', 'King', 'found', 'works', 'adapted', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'THE', 'LANGOLIERS', 'hugely', 'refreshing', 'flaws', 'consistently', 'suspenseful', 'manner', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits']",Langoliers VHS
378559,A97Q71MM5N4NW,6303514723,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[3, 4]","Everything was really good about this film. A good Stephen King adaption of the book which really made you realize that they were all alone in the world of the past. For a movie to do that is pretty hard. And what really got me is the mysterious music, and don't ask me why, but the music is usually what always attracts me to a movie. As for the effects, well they're as flat as an old tire. You still get the idea of the Langoliers though.American Pride flight #29 to Boston is a seemingly normal flight to Massachussets until about 19/20 of the passengers disappear. In the midst of it all, the ten passengers that are left find on landing to Bangor, Maine for a less busier airport, that everyone else had disappeared to on the ground. To add up to the problem, nothing works anymore. Matches refuse to light, eletrical equipment refuses to turn on, sound defies logic by not echoing, and the air has no odor to it even after just landing. And not only are the people gone, but it seems all living life has disappeared too. But upon exploring the matter more, maybe what has happened has happened to the ten survivors of flight #29, and in the spiralling vortex that has the ten trapped, there may not be a way out for the even approaching evil in the emptiness of this world.I really like the concept of time travel in the book (which was also very good, a part of the novella Four Past Midnight) and how you cannot hope to time travel and find that everything is once what it used to be.I always wonder where Stephen King gets these crazy ideas of his, but I find it just comes by simple things complicated into being something different which is how I found the fourteen year old author within myself by the help of Stephen Kings inspiration.

The only folks remaining are 10 people who happen to be sleeping at the moment the aeroplane passed through a time-warp. Fortunately, one of these is a qualified pilot who's ""dead-handing"" to Boston for his estranged wife's funeral. Naturally, he takes charge of the remainder of the flight.No contact can be established with any ATC tower and the radar shows no other aircraft in the vicinity. So the pilot tries the military frequencies but still finds nothing! Given that there are no lights on the ground, he diverts from Boston-Logan to a less busy airport in rural Maine. Bangor seems totally deserted and there's something strange about the atmosphere; it's lifeless, there's no echo, beer tastes flat and matches won't light! Each character is developed well; one of the passengers happens to be a mystery writer (like Stephen King, who wrote the novel on which the film is based).

There's an impatient, mentally unstable banker with an important business meeting in Boston and a British secret agent who tries to take charge in this seemingly impossible situation.

Again, it's not my fave film but you can't deny that what happened in this film, the way the people acted, can totally happen in real life. If I were any of the females in this film, I would have acted the same exact way. Due to being afraid. All the females were scared and none of them were fake. They acted like normal people. Everyone acted like people could be in real life. I see no flaws whatsoever in the acting.People are saying this film isn't scary. That couldn't be further from the truth. The movie is very scary. There are different kinds of scary. You have jump out of your seat scary and then you have psychological kind of scary. This film is psychologically scary. Just to be at this completely abandoned airport where even the air quality is different and sounds are different and no echo. That is very scary. I get scared thinking about this and picturing myself there. It's terrifying. The whole atmosphere is completely scary in itself. This film is definitely scary.People say the music score in this is horrible. Again, I completely disagree. The music is very unsettling. I feel the music was perfect and nothing is out of place. That music that plays when you see the langoliers and the plane takes off is very intense. I love it.People say the special effects are horrible. Once again, I completely disagree. I feel they add to the film and especially when you are watching the langoliers eat at the airport itself while they are waiting to take off down the runway and then that whole time they are going down the runway and taking off and seeing the earth itself getting eaten away, I'm at the edge of my seat.

Also staring Patricia Wetting (Thirty Something) as a school teacher named Laurel Stevenson, and Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap). The plot line was a bit slow in most places but it really picked up at the end. Diana the blind girl played by Kate Maberly pretty much steels some scenes.

This has to be one of the worst Stephen King adaptations ever made, and that's saying something, what with 'Graveyard Shift'.  The premise is mildly interesting - a group of people on a plane enter a time rip.  All the people, everything has disappared and the Langoliers are coming.  For such a long movie, the suspense isn't very well racked up.  The mention of these mysterious Langoliers punctuates the film, with a mad man (the only good actor here) mentioning them fearfully whilst tearing up pieces of newspaper.  When the Langoliers finally do arrive, it's a major disappointment.  In a way, it's a shame that the movie wasn't given a bigger budget because the idea of these things crunching their way through the landscape to the small group of people could have been quite effective.  As it is we're treated to the bland imagery of an airport and the runways outside.  How are we to really believe that these people are trapped in a huge international airport.What really brings this film down is how incredibly predictable it is.  The characters in it include a blind child, a young woman who becomes a pseudo-mother to her, the well-built hero and the mad wimp.  Yes, there's not one clich&eacute; unaccounted for.  As all of these characters are two-dimensional then it's hard to feel any sympathy for them.It's a shame really, because there are so many fantastic King adaptations - check out 'Carrie', 'The Shining', 'Misery' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' - but this lacks the humanity that past King films have been so full of.  It also lacks the mind-numbing fear that gives many King adaptations their edge.  Unfortunately, this is not only mediocre but also dull.

Creepy odd things occur that make you really want to figure out what is going on and not stop watching.The Bad:(1) Some of the acting is absolutely awful and distracting from the film. It seemed some of the performances were over-the-top.(2) Could have been 1hr + 30 mins rather than 2+ hrs. There is a romance that seems to be out of place ... seems like we don't really need to know or don't want to know about it.(3) I watched this recently and due to technology advances, old CGI effects look really terrible. I really had to make an effort to put this aside.(4) The ending was not what I would call a normal Stephen King ending... but I didn't read the book so maybe it was the same in the book. Just seems that all the Stephen King stories I have read have had a particular style to the endings and this one was different but not a good different. Now, I realize that the books are different from the video-film adaption of the book, so with that in mind I was ok with it.Over all I enjoyed watching the film but caught myself drifting off at different times as my interest would fluctuate.

378584,A15ZZDKRKP7L4R,6303514723,Nick Tropiano,"[4, 4]","The standout of King's Four Past Midnight was the Twilight Zone-esque, The Langoliers, a very good entry into the time-twister category in an otherwise uneven collection of four King novellas. Given the mixed bag of Steven King adapatations, I had low expectations for this 1995 TV movie. Turned out to be a pleasant surprise...- Direction:  Nice job with pacing. Things move along briskly, and the three hours run time is over before you know it.- Script: The editing of the source material is marginal and sensible; it is very faithful to the original story.- Casting: Casting is damned near perfect except perhaps for the Dinah character who is somewhat grating but not disasterously so. The actors are pretty close to how I envisioned them.- Acting: Nice job by the cast. Bronson Pinchot as Toomey is especially good along with Mark Lindsay Chapman as Nick.- Special Effects: Better than expected for 1995 TV movie CGI effects. Sure, they're cartoony but given what the script called for them to execute on a TV movie budget using CGI, which was cutting edge at the time, they're fine. Do they compare with modern 100 million plus budget theatrical film effects from a decade later? No. But is this a realistic expectation? Again, no.Not the worst King adaptation I've seen - not by a long stretch. To the contrary, this is one of the more credible TV movie stabs at science fiction. It's an entertaining, competently executed, and faithful adaptation of a very good short story by Steven King that's well worth a look.",4,Nicely Done...,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1523,"['standout', 'King', 'Four', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'was', 'Twilight', 'Zone-esque', 'Langoliers', 'very', 'good', 'entry', 'time-twister', 'category', 'otherwise', 'uneven', 'collection', 'four', 'King', 'novellas', 'Given', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Steven', 'King', 'adapatations', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', '1995', 'TV', 'movie', 'Turned', 'out', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Direction', 'Nice', 'job', 'pacing', 'Things', 'move', 'along', 'briskly', 'three', 'hours', 'run', 'time', 'over', 'know', 'it.-', 'Script', 'editing', 'source', 'material', 'marginal', 'sensible', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'story.-', 'Casting', 'Casting', 'damned', 'perfect', 'perhaps', 'Dinah', 'character', 'who', 'somewhat', 'grating', 'not', 'disasterously', 'so', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'close', 'how', 'envisioned', 'them.-', 'Acting', 'Nice', 'job', 'cast', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'Toomey', 'especially', 'good', 'Mark', 'Lindsay', 'Chapman', 'Nick.-', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Better', 'expected', '1995', 'TV', 'movie', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'cartoony', 'given', 'what', 'script', 'called', 'execute', 'TV', 'movie', 'budget', 'using', 'CGI', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', ""'re"", 'fine', 'Do', 'compare', 'modern', '100', 'million', 'budget', 'theatrical', 'film', 'effects', 'decade', 'later', 'No', 'realistic', 'expectation', 'Again', 'worst', 'King', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'long', 'stretch', 'contrary', 'one', 'more', 'credible', 'TV', 'movie', 'stabs', 'science', 'fiction', 'entertaining', 'competently', 'executed', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'very', 'good', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'King', 'well', 'look']",Langoliers VHS

Dean Stockwell overplayed his role, but was still the most likeable character in the group. Bronson Pinchot totally redeemed himself after that eighties-sitcom disaster, and Christopher Collet and Kimber Riddle did a realistic job of playing teens. (The only one who annoyed me was Patricia Wettig.) The filming was another issue; there were some glaring bloopers such as shadows of people moving beyond the Bangor airport's glass doors and a few cars driving in the streets of 'deserted' L.A.! The computer-generated Langoliers and sliced-and-diced airfield? Terrible. But the plot and dialogue were for the most part very loyal to the novella, which I have reread so many times it is falling apart.

378588,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6303514723,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","This is one of my favorite Stephen King stories, from the terrific collection of novellas, FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT.  However, the ""mini-series"" create therefrom is not too great.I saw this show when it first aired, over two nights, and I wasn't super thrilled with it then.  Watched it last night on DVD, thinking that with nearly one hour of commercials missing, it might be more entertaining.  Well...it was shorter, but the flaws were still there.Basically, the story is fairly solid, if a bit ""talky.""  They spend a lot of time in the ""what do you suppose happened"" mode...which I think is mostly to stretch a 2 hour movie over 3 hours.  The pace is pretty dead throughout the middle of the story.  The premise itself is solid (if silly).  Ten passengers on a cross country flight wake up to find their plane totally empty, and the world below them apparently devoid of habitation.  This is quite creepy.  They land in Bangor, Maine (where King is from, of course), and proceed to conclude that they seem to have passed through a portal into the past...which is ""winding down"" so that nothing really works like it should.The theory isn't all that credible, even by the standards of such things, but you just go with it and say ""whatever.""  One of the passengers, Craig Toomey, is an insane stock-broker type who has spent his entire life bullied by his father, and it's turned him into a major jerk, possibly a homicidal one.This is all well and good.  As with mini-series made for TV, the acting is spotty.  David Morse and Patricia Wettig make out the best.  Morse has always been an actor of quiet power, even in ""silly"" roles, and there's a reason he's made a pretty successful transition to the screen.  He's likeable and grounded.  Wettig is natural as well, even with some TERRIBLE dialogue.  It's too bad we don't really see her anymore.Bronson Pinchot plays Craig Toomey.  I would be hard pressed to think of a performance MORE over-the-top than his.  He makes Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING look restrained.  He is absolutely laughable and miscast.  This is unfortunate, because his part is so crucial to building tension...but the boat is missed there.  What was needed was some ""gravitas"" to go with the wacky behavior...not just wild histrionics.  Oh, well.  Dean Stockwell plays the mystery writer...which qualifies him, apparently, to be the guy who figures out what's going on with them.  This he does with long stretches of speeches, beginning with ""my dear boy.""  He's the type of writer who wears bad sports coats and arches his eyebrows alot.  Do writers like that REALLY exist?  Anyway, I usually like Stockwell, but he seems a little lost.  The rest of the cast are mostly ""unknowns"" and for good reason. The young lady who plays Dinah, a pre-teen girl who is blind but has some psychic abilities, is quite, quite dreadful.  I hate to knock a child...but all these years later, she's a grown-up, so I don't feel so bad!  It's a horrible performance in another crucial role.  And at one point, she is badly injured, and spits up a batch of blood.  A swipe of it is left on her face for the entire rest of the movie...even when the rest of her new friends carefully tend to her...no one thinks to wipe the blood from her lips!?Finally, the special effects.  Now I know that TV movies can't afford much.  In this film, though, we spend about an hour waiting for the appearance of the dreaded Langoliers.  When they show up, they are the absolute bottom of the barrel computer generated garbage.  Any tension that was built is COMPLETELY obliterated.  I've seen plenty of movies with lousy effects over the years..some from the age of bad effects (by our standards today), some from low budgets, and some from over ambition.  I don't know what went wrong with the Langoliers, but the effects are awful.  I mostly felt terribly sorry for all the actors who worked so hard creating terrified reactions, only to be totally betrayed by the effects in post-production.I can't really recommend the movie.  It has some good, fun ideas, some good performances, and for a TV movie, at least a few moments of ""good stuff.""  The first 30 minutes, and last 15 or so are pretty solid.  But it could have been SO MUCH MORE.  I'd love to see a theatrical version, at proper length, with a decent cast and good effects.  That might actually generate the required thrills.  But I imagine this television effort will have forever soured the chances of this.",3,Some poor acting and MISERABLE effects don't help,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,4455,"['one', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'terrific', 'collection', 'novellas', 'FOUR', 'PAST', 'MIDNIGHT', 'However', 'mini-series', 'create', 'therefrom', 'not', 'too', 'great.I', 'saw', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'two', 'nights', 'was', ""n't"", 'super', 'thrilled', 'then', 'Watched', 'last', 'night', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'nearly', 'one', 'hour', 'commercials', 'missing', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Well', 'was', 'shorter', 'flaws', 'were', 'still', 'there.Basically', 'story', 'fairly', 'solid', 'bit', 'talky', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'what', 'do', 'suppose', 'happened', 'mode', 'think', 'mostly', 'stretch', '2', 'hour', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'pace', 'pretty', 'dead', 'middle', 'story', 'premise', 'solid', 'silly', 'Ten', 'passengers', 'cross', 'country', 'flight', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'plane', 'totally', 'empty', 'world', 'apparently', 'habitation', 'quite', 'creepy', 'land', 'Bangor', 'Maine', 'where', 'King', 'course', 'proceed', 'conclude', 'seem', 'have', 'passed', 'portal', 'past', 'winding', 'down', 'nothing', 'really', 'theory', ""n't"", 'credible', 'even', 'standards', 'such', 'things', 'just', 'go', 'say', 'One', 'passengers', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'insane', 'stock-broker', 'type', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'bullied', 'father', 'turned', 'major', 'jerk', 'possibly', 'homicidal', 'one.This', 'well', 'good', 'mini-series', 'made', 'TV', 'acting', 'spotty', 'David', 'Morse', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'make', 'out', 'best', 'Morse', 'always', 'been', 'actor', 'quiet', 'power', 'even', 'silly', 'roles', 'reason', 'made', 'pretty', 'successful', 'transition', 'screen', 'likeable', 'grounded', 'Wettig', 'natural', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'TERRIBLE', 'dialogue', 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anymore.Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'Craig', 'Toomey', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'think', 'performance', 'MORE', 'over-the-top', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'look', 'restrained', 'absolutely', 'laughable', 'miscast', 'unfortunate', 'part', 'so', 'crucial', 'building', 'tension', 'boat', 'missed', 'there', 'What', 'was', 'needed', 'was', 'gravitas', 'go', 'wacky', 'behavior', 'not', 'just', 'wild', 'histrionics', 'Oh', 'well', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'mystery', 'writer', 'apparently', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'long', 'stretches', 'speeches', 'beginning', 'dear', 'boy', 'type', 'writer', 'who', 'bad', 'sports', 'coats', 'eyebrows', 'alot', 'Do', 'writers', 'REALLY', 'exist', 'Anyway', 'usually', 'like', 'Stockwell', 'little', 'lost', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'good', 'reason', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Dinah', 'pre-teen', 'girl', 'who', 'blind', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'quite', 'quite', 'dreadful', 'hate', 'knock', 'child', 'years', 'later', 'grown-up', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'horrible', 'performance', 'crucial', 'role', 'one', 'point', 'badly', 'injured', 'up', 'batch', 'blood', 'swipe', 'left', 'face', 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'rest', 'new', 'friends', 'carefully', 'tend', 'one', 'wipe', 'blood', 'lips', 'Finally', 'special', 'effects', 'Now', 'know', 'TV', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'much', 'film', 'though', 'spend', 'hour', 'waiting', 'appearance', 'dreaded', 'Langoliers', 'When', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'absolute', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'computer', 'generated', 'garbage', 'tension', 'was', 'built', 'COMPLETELY', 'obliterated', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'movies', 'lousy', 'effects', 'years..some', 'age', 'bad', 'effects', 'standards', 'today', 'low', 'budgets', 'ambition', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Langoliers', 'effects', 'are', 'awful', 'mostly', 'felt', 'terribly', 'sorry', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'creating', 'terrified', 'reactions', 'only', 'be', 'totally', 'betrayed', 'effects', 'post-production.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'good', 'fun', 'ideas', 'good', 'performances', 'TV', 'movie', 'least', 'few', 'moments', 'good', 'stuff', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'last', '15', 'so', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'MORE', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'theatrical', 'version', 'proper', 'length', 'decent', 'cast', 'good', 'effects', 'might', 'actually', 'generate', 'required', 'thrills', 'imagine', 'television', 'effort', 'will', 'have', 'forever', 'soured', 'chances']",Langoliers VHS

Based on the novella in Stephen King's book Four Past Midnight, The Langoliers is the tale of 9 people on a red-eye flight coming from LA who awaken to find themselves all alone on the plane--everybody, including the flight crew, having disappeared when the plane flew into a mysterious ""time rip"" that was directly in their path.  Luckily for the others, one of the passengers happens to be Captain Brian Engle, a pilot dead-heading home after receiving the news that his ex-wife was killed in a fire.  When Capt. Engle takes over the controls of the plane and diverts their flight to Bangor, Maine, that's when the fun and suspense begins.Although I have to agree that the special effects were rather obvious and cheesy, I felt that the story and acting more than made up for it.  David Morse was great as Capt. Engle, the pilot who finds himself in a situation that he's never faced before.  I loved Mark Lindsay Chapman as Nick Hopewell, the British government ""assassin"" who suddenly finds himself re-examining his life as the langoliers come after him and his compatriots aboard the plane.  It was very nice to see The Secret Garden's Kate Maberly as Dinah, the young blind girl with a power that may help save the others from what's coming.  Patricia Wettig handled herself quite well as Laurel, the schoolteacher that takes Dinah under her charge, and who Nick finds himself falling for.  Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell was wonderful as Bob Jenkins, the mystery writer who seems to be the voice of reason among all the others.  I had a few concerns at first about Bronson Pinchot as Craig Toomey--my first thought when I saw him was OMG, Balki from Perfect Strangers is playing a crazy guy--but as the story went on I felt that he did quite a good job with his part.In the end, I thought that The Langoliers was an excellent piece of storytelling, even with the cheesy F/X, and one of Stephen King's best miniseries to date.

The eat up the airport and eat away the strange land and every one except Mr Toomey and Mr Gaffney (Mr Toomey stabs him thinking he is a Langolier) get away.They look on in horror as the world disapears in to the blackness below.I give the film 5 Stars!",5,The Langoliers,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,1140,"['film', 'excellent', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'one', 'night.Ten', 'people', 'fly', 'timerip', 'discover', 'everyone', 'was', 'awake', 'disapeared.My', 'favourite', 'part', 'when', 'get', 'strange', 'world', 'where', 'Langoliers', 'come', 'get', 'air', 'strange', 'echo', 'power', 'are', 'plane', 'when', 'walk', 'ground', 'feet', 'sound', 'different', 'normal', 'weather', 'dark', 'then', 'light', 'again', '40', 'mins', 'food', 'drinks', 'are', 'flat.My', 'favourite', 'character', 'poor', 'poor', 'Mr', 'Toomey', 'wreck', 'father', 'brainwashed', 'telling', ""n't"", 'buck', 'up', 'ideas', 'stop', 'wasting', 'time', 'Langoliers', 'will', 'get', 'eat', 'alive.The', 'part', 'leave', 'see', 'Langliers', 'chase', 'Mr', 'Toomey', 'see', 'Langliers', 'teeth', 'move', 'around', 'circle', 'sort', 'make', 'creepy', 'noise', 'clash', 'teeth', 'together', 'eat', 'up', 'airport', 'eat', 'away', 'strange', 'land', 'one', 'Mr', 'Toomey', 'Mr', 'Gaffney', 'Mr', 'Toomey', 'stabs', 'thinking', 'Langolier', 'get', 'away.They', 'look', 'horror', 'world', 'blackness', 'below.I', 'give', 'film', '5', 'Stars']",Langoliers VHS
378594,AP3B615GM191G,6303514723,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","There is no doubt that in this version of ""The Langoliers"", despite being a very serious Stephen King novella, the material is quite cheeseball and (at times) very over-dramatic.  Yet, at the same time, the brilliance of King's story still manages to shine through thanks to some great acting and the direction of Tom Holland.For a basic plot summary (no spoilers), a small group of airplane passengers wake up and find the rest of the plane deserted.  As they struggle to land the plane and figure out what is going on, they discover that the answer is beyond anything that has ever been seen or experienced before.First off, it would take a great sight more than a bit of 90s cheesy-ness to detract from King's wonderful tale.  This is a wide-ranging story (from drama to sci-fi to characters to fantasy) that has something for everyone.  Most of King's writing shines through in this adaptation.The acting, however, is what really drives this three-hour film.  Great actors such as Patricia Wettig, Dean Stockwell, David Morse, Mark Lindsay Chapman, and Bronson Pinochet (among others) all provide new wrinkles to the overall storyline by portraying such a diverse cast.  Is the acting over-the-top?  You bet.  But due to the diversity of the characters and their development, the craziness actually didn't bother me all that much.  Perhaps this is because I ""knew what was coming"" having already read the story, though.Overall, having prior knowledge of the story, I enjoyed this take on ""The Langoliers"".  While I would still recommend King's written work to get the full extent of the tale, this one will suffice for those who won't pick up a book.",4,"Very ""90s Cheesy"", But Still Will Hold Your Interest",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,1654,"['doubt', 'version', 'Langoliers', 'being', 'very', 'serious', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'material', 'quite', 'cheeseball', 'times', 'very', 'over-dramatic', 'same', 'time', 'brilliance', 'King', 'story', 'still', 'shine', 'thanks', 'great', 'acting', 'direction', 'Tom', 'Holland.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'spoilers', 'small', 'group', 'airplane', 'passengers', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'rest', 'plane', 'deserted', 'struggle', 'land', 'plane', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'discover', 'answer', 'anything', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'experienced', 'off', 'would', 'take', 'great', 'sight', 'more', 'bit', '90s', 'cheesy-ness', 'detract', 'King', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'wide-ranging', 'story', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'something', 'everyone', 'Most', 'King', 'writing', 'shines', 'adaptation.The', 'acting', 'however', 'what', 'really', 'three-hour', 'film', 'Great', 'actors', 'such', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'David', 'Morse', 'Mark', 'Lindsay', 'Chapman', 'Bronson', 'Pinochet', 'others', 'provide', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'overall', 'storyline', 'portraying', 'diverse', 'cast', 'acting', 'over-the-top', 'bet', 'due', 'diversity', 'characters', 'development', 'craziness', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'having', 'already', 'read', 'story', 'though.Overall', 'having', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'take', 'Langoliers', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'King', 'written', 'work', 'get', 'full', 'extent', 'tale', 'one', 'will', 'suffice', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'book']",Langoliers VHS
