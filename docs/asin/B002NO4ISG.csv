1279972,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002NO4ISG,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Maiden Heist barely gets the job done as far as succeeding in making me laugh and therefore I grudgingly award it a high rating.  I greatly admire the many works of Morgan Freeman and Christopher Walken, but in this particular film their characters were just ""okay"" and nothing truly exciting or thought-provoking ever took place for *either* of them.The storyline is about three men who attempt to steal special pictures located in an art museum and keep them for themselves.  One picture (of a beautiful girl) obviously means quite a lot to Christopher Walken's character.  They want to steal these pictures because the entire museum is planning to move somewhere far away (Denmark).The one drawback to the storyline is that it's entirely predictable.  You really don't even have to watch the movie to know exactly how they're planning to break into the museum because just sitting there and picturing it would be a pretty accurate description.  Just remember it's a comedy and not a suspense or anything and yeah, I'm sure you know what's gonna happen.It's predictable storytelling at its most basic but it doesn't matter to me personally because the film contained enough jokes to make it enjoyable to watch.  The most obvious segment being the crate mix up... yeah you knew THAT was coming!Christopher Walken's wife was very funny too, so the movie scores additional points solely because of her character.  As odd as this might be to say, she's actually a really attractive woman.  This is hard for me to say because I believe I'm *much* younger than she is!This is just a fairly short and pretty hilarious film, though ultimately you'll be able to predict what happens... except maybe the very final scene which is a nice way to wrap things up.",4,funny... enough,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,1755,"['Maiden', 'Heist', 'barely', 'job', 'done', 'as', 'far', 'succeeding', 'making', 'laugh', 'therefore', 'grudgingly', 'award', 'high', 'rating', 'greatly', 'admire', 'many', 'works', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'particular', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'truly', 'exciting', 'thought-provoking', 'ever', 'took', 'place', '*either*', 'them.The', 'storyline', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'attempt', 'steal', 'special', 'pictures', 'located', 'art', 'museum', 'keep', 'One', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'obviously', 'quite', 'lot', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'character', 'want', 'steal', 'pictures', 'entire', 'museum', 'planning', 'move', 'somewhere', 'far', 'away', 'Denmark', '.The', 'one', 'drawback', 'storyline', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', ""'re"", 'planning', 'break', 'museum', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'picturing', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'description', 'Just', 'remember', 'comedy', 'not', 'suspense', 'anything', 'yeah', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'gon', 'happen.It', 'predictable', 'storytelling', 'most', 'basic', ""n't"", 'matter', 'personally', 'film', 'contained', 'enough', 'jokes', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'most', 'obvious', 'segment', 'being', 'crate', 'mix', 'up', 'yeah', 'knew', 'THAT', 'was', 'coming', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'wife', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'too', 'movie', 'additional', 'points', 'solely', 'character', 'As', 'odd', 'might', 'be', 'say', 'actually', 'really', 'attractive', 'woman', 'hard', 'say', 'believe', ""'m"", '*much*', 'younger', 'just', 'fairly', 'short', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'film', 'ultimately', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'what', 'maybe', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'nice', 'way', 'wrap', 'things', 'up']",The Maiden Heist

Anyone who loves art and appreciates a good laugh will enjoy this movie.  It has a great cast including Morgan Freeman, Marcia Gay Harden and William Macy.The gist of the story is about three security guards who have been working for many years in a famous museum.  Each of them has fallen in love with a particular piece of art.  When they hear that the museum is planning to send the pieces they love to Denmark, they come up with a way to steal their favorite pieces and keep them for posterity.I highly recommend this film for Indie lovers and those who like something different from the 'big screen'.",5,"Poignant, Eccentric, and Funny",1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,716,"['saw', 'funny', 'poignant', 'movie', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'still', 'mind', 'quirky', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'art', 'good', 'laugh', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'William', 'Macy.The', 'gist', 'story', 'three', 'security', 'guards', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'many', 'years', 'famous', 'museum', 'fallen', 'love', 'particular', 'piece', 'art', 'When', 'hear', 'museum', 'planning', 'send', 'pieces', 'love', 'Denmark', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'steal', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'keep', 'posterity.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Indie', 'lovers', 'who', 'like', 'something', 'different', ""'big"", 'screen']",The Maiden Heist

1279975,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B002NO4ISG,David A. Wend,"[26, 26]","The prior reviews of The Maiden Heist have given a good idea of the story of this film.  To those I have some non-spoiler comments.The Maiden Heist, to judge from the clapboards, was originally titled The Maiden Lady from the painting that Christopher Walken is obsessed with.  This film answers the question if museum guards actually like the art they protect. The three guards of the story - Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman and William H. Macey - are all obsessed with different pieces of art.  They feel very protective about their art so when they learn that the entire exhibit will be moved to a museum in Denmark and replaced by some avant-guard art, they decide to save their favorites.Morgan Freeman plays a soft-spoken affable man who enjoys drawing and painting; William H. Macey's character claims he was a Marine but changes his combat stories and Christopher Walken is a quiet homebody who daydreams about protecting his Maiden Lady from ant harm. Marcia Gay Harden has a marvelous supporting role as Christopher Walken's wife who-must-be-obeyed.The fun of the film is that the three guards fumble their way through the heist.  There are many funny scenes in the film but also some that stretch the imagination. The conclusion of the film is one of real charm and understanding.  The DVD comes with bonus features that include a making of the film, deleted scenes and bloopers. The many scenes that were deleted struck me as wise decisions.  The performances are what make this film and are excellent even when the material is lacking.",4,A Charming Film,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,1551,"['prior', 'reviews', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'have', 'given', 'good', 'idea', 'story', 'film', 'have', 'non-spoiler', 'comments.The', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'judge', 'clapboards', 'was', 'originally', 'titled', 'Maiden', 'Lady', 'painting', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'obsessed', 'film', 'question', 'museum', 'guards', 'actually', 'art', 'protect', 'three', 'guards', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'William', 'H.', 'Macey', 'are', 'obsessed', 'different', 'pieces', 'art', 'feel', 'very', 'protective', 'art', 'when', 'learn', 'entire', 'exhibit', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'museum', 'Denmark', 'replaced', 'avant-guard', 'art', 'decide', 'save', 'favorites.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'soft-spoken', 'affable', 'man', 'who', 'drawing', 'painting', 'William', 'H.', 'Macey', 'character', 'claims', 'was', 'Marine', 'combat', 'stories', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'quiet', 'homebody', 'who', 'protecting', 'Maiden', 'Lady', 'ant', 'harm', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'role', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'wife', 'who-must-be-obeyed.The', 'fun', 'film', 'three', 'guards', 'fumble', 'way', 'heist', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'also', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'conclusion', 'film', 'one', 'real', 'charm', 'understanding', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'making', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'struck', 'wise', 'decisions', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'even', 'when', 'material', 'lacking']",The Maiden Heist

The Maiden Heist is about three old guys that decide to steal art from a museum after finding out that the exhibit is closing.

1279978,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002NO4ISG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","Back in May 2009, I was awaiting the film ""The Maiden Heist"" which featured an all-star cast featuring Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman (""Unforgiven"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Million Dollar Baby""), Christopher Walken (""The Deer Hunter"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Wayne's World 2'), William H. Macy (""Fargo"", ""Jurassic Park 3', ""Seabiscuit"") and Marcia Gay Harden (""Pollock"", ""Damages"", ""Mystic River"").The film was directed by Peter Hewitt (""Garfield"", ""Zoom""), a screenplay by Michael LeSieur (""You, Me and Dupree""), music by Rupert Gregson-Williams (""Bedtime Stories"", ""Made of Honor"", ""You Don't Mess with Zohan"") and cinematography by Ueli Steiger (""10,000 BC"", ""Nomad"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"").All would seem good for an early summer release but then the film's distributor Yari Film Group (known for films such as ""The Illusionist"", ""Kickin' It Old School"", ""The Accidental Husband"") filed for bankruptcy and the film was shelved.  The film did happen to debut at the Edinburgh International Film Festival but unfortunately, that was it.  And now the film has its DVD release courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.""The Maiden Heist"" starts off with Roger (Christopher Walken) who works in security for a major museum where the painting the ""Lonely Maiden"" is kept.  Roger absolutely adores this painting.  He dreams of himself defending the painting from thieves and he's literally in love with the painting and knows all the details about it.  Meanwhile, back at home, his wife (played by Marcia Gay Harden) dreams about going to Miami and has been saving her money specifically for this trip.Roger is not very talkative towards his wife.  In fact, he goes home, puts on his beret, listens to French music and just reads about the ""Lonely Maiden"".But life starts to become disrupted when he finds out that ""The Lonely Maiden"" and other artifacts from the museum are being shipped out overseas to Denmark.  Roger is absolutely crushed.  He then discovers that he is not the only one.  Another security guard named Charles (played by Morgan Freeman) is also enamored with another painting in the museum and has been in love with it.  So, in love to the point that he has painted the exact painting in his home.  But similar to how Roger is with the ""Lonely Maiden"", Charles is with the painting that he enjoyed for so many years.After meeting over lunch, Charles comes up with an idea...""why not steal the paintings"" they love.  But of course, Roger is quite dedicated to his job and tells Charles that they are security guards with a job to protect the paintings not steal them.  But life then changes when Charles discovers another person in security who is enamored with a sculpture at the museum.  Charles shows Roger surveillance captured of the other security guard named George (played by William H. Macy).  George has some unusual fetish as a late night security guard  and likes to strip off all his clothes in front of the sculpture (which is a naked man showing off his muscles) and do a similar pose.Charles and Roger feel that with another man to help them, they can probably pull of another heist.  After talking to George (who used to be part of the Marines), he absolutely is supportive of the idea.  Why not create forgeries of the paintings and the sculpture and replace them before they are shipped to Denmark.  Will the three be able to pull off the heist?VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Maiden Heist"" is presented in anamorphic widescreen (2:40:1) and for the most part, cinematography by Ueli Steiger is done quite well.  Shot in Boston and also at the Worcester Art Museum, most of the film takes place in the museum but also at Roger and Charles apartment.Lighting is well-done and for the most part, all three men look great and despite being older men, the film gives the men a youthful spin as these guys must try to pull of the unthinkable.  Picture quality for the most part is well done and good use of utilization of shots throughout the film but the film does look very good.Audio-wise, the film is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and also jazzy music plays a part in the film as well.  Thus it's more or less front and center channel driven.  I didn't notice a whole lot of surround usage as this film is not exactly an action film.  But for the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Maiden Heist"" comes with the following special features:* Director, Writer and Producer Commentary -  Audio commentary by Director Pete Hewitt, Writer Michael LeSieur and Producer Rob Paris.  An enjoyable and informative commentary providing insight to the characters and film-making details of the set location, production design and scenes.* In the Presence of Art: Making The Maiden Heist Featurette - (17:40) Featuring the cast and crew talking about the film.  The cast talk about their characters while the director talked about how this film had an awesome script but it was all about when the film would become a reality.* Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - Featuring optional commentary for 12 short deleted scenes which include: Roger and Charlie Meet, Too Much Gas, Over My Dead Body, A Few Words from the Curator, Donnie, The Lovely Mr. Needlebaum, A Few Words from George, It's Me They want, The Shirt, Waiting for Roger, The Avant Guard, More Donnie* Bloopers Reel - (2:45) Bloopers from ""The Maiden Heist""* Previews - Trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment films on Blu-ray and DVD.JUDGMENT CALL:After watching this film, I enjoyed the film and its witty sense of humor but also how clever the screenplay is.  Director Peter Hewitt said that one of the things that came to his mind when working on this film are those security guards at a museum.  Many are old and what keeps them going in such a job.  And the film tries to showcase how these three security guards just fall in love with a certain item at the museum and are very protective of it.  Granted, I don't any security guards at museums personally to know if this happens in real life but if it does, that would be quite interesting.As mentioned, these three Academy Award winning men look absolutely full of youth.  It was fun to see Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken and William H. Macy so energetic.  In fact, surprising enough, the PG-13 rating comes from William H. Macy's nude scenes.  And these three play interesting characters. Although it's not in your face, Freeman plays a gay man, Walken plays a husband who doesn't really take notice of his wife because he's so in love with a painting and Macy's character, although he's pretty gung-ho and talks about the Marines, his hobby of taking off his clothes in front of a nude male statue is a bit odd.  Especially when he gives advice to Roger (Walken) of how he should be more of  a man when taking care of his wife.  But overall, it's just interesting to see how these men become attached so much to these beloved items and will do what it takes to keep them home and not have their own personal lives disrupted.And as these three men are quite interesting to watch, Marcia Gay Harden is absolutely fabulous as the wife who just works her butt off for a vacation with her husband that seems to be long overdue.  She's a talker but it seems this vacation is all that keeps her going in her marriage and she plays a great job as a wife who is determined to go on this trip.Although a predictable, straightforward film, ""The Maiden Heist"" doesn't need to be a ""Mission Impossible"" or highly technological style of film.  It's all about the performances of the four talents and they all make this film happen.  It's unfortunate that the film never received a theatrical release due to the distributor's bankruptcy but it's a fun, lighthearted comedy that is worth giving a try.Overall, ""The Maiden Heist"" is a fun comedy that is witty, hilarious and very entertaining courtesy of the film's all-star cast.  All four Academy Award winners - Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken, William H. Macy and Marcia Gay Harden made this art caper so fun to watch.  Definitely a film worth checking out!",4,"Witty, hilarious and very entertaining courtesy of the film's all-star cast",1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,8161,"['Back', 'May', '2009', 'was', 'awaiting',

1279979,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002NO4ISG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","THE MAIDEN HEIST (2008) directed by Peter Hewitt (ZOOM, see my review) is one of those gentle, hilarious comedies that remind me of Australian and British type things. (Hewitt is British.) It is a DELIGHT and not a single real swear word throughout the marvelous little jewel of a film.George (William H. Macy), Roger (Christopher Walken), and Charles (Morgan Freeman) are hilarious everyday-Joe security guards at a Boston museum of art. Each has his true love - a work of art for each one - and they sigh with complete and total LOVE just seeing their artworks. One day they hear about a complete move: a Denmark museum has decided to buy the works in exchange for some horrid artworks that are thankfully only mentioned and not shown.The boys decide they will steal their particular coveted works. For George it is a bronze of a naked man called ""The Bronze Warrior""; for Roger it is ""The Lonely Maiden"" painting and for gay Charles it is ""Woman with Cats"" or something - all are fictional works and I love that detail. Each work shows us a bit of what each man truly is inside. Their plan, though I thought it way too easy, works like a charm.With a team like Walken, Freeman and Macy it cannot be anything but great - the film never disappoints. Though it reminded me a little too often of THE SUNSHINE BOYS, it works so well on that simple, happy level. Yet there is a real tension in their plans, and the way the kinks get smoothed along the way.This was filmed at Boston Commons and I like that - too many Canadian locations for my blood nowadays. The performances, many of them ad-lib, are spectacular but quiet. Though I know nearly nothing about this, since I never saw it new and I hear it was direct-to-video, it needed to impress no one.Yet it is one of the most impressive films I've ever enjoyed. I wish my parents were here to see it too.And if you are an artist, well, there's no limit to the joy in identifying with these sensitive, tender-hearted art thieves (I prefer to call them ""defenders"").

Let me share what I liked most about it. Christopher Walken.He stares at a painting entitled ""The Lonely Maiden"", and has fallen deeply in love with it over the years, while his very attentive and loving wife (Harden) waits patiently for him to come back around to her. She does not know about his love affair with the painting, and she comes off as kind and doting. SHE is the lonely maiden. I figured that out early. Walken is entranced with the painting, when all the while the true lonely maiden was right in front of him. Of course, he loves his wife and is attached to her forever (you can tell that they have an old-fashioned and sadly-gone view of marriage--stick it out to the end no matter what). And as he plans the heist with his fellow security guards, he keeps his wife's needs in mind the whole time. There is also a very sweet happy ending for these two (Shhhh).Macy's character is married but we only know that because he said so. Macy's character is an odd one. He has some dubious military training and takes leadership in the heist. And he likes to get naked in front of a nude male statue... nothing more. Really. Just strip down and pose in front of it.Freeman's character likes cats (and obviously has no wife). Any man who likes cats is okay in my book!This heist movie is fun and friendly; we enjoyed rollicking around town with these three old guys.BOTTOM LINE: if you like grumpy-old-men, this is like not-so-grumpy old men. They make you laugh and wince, and you may still be smiling when you're done. There are also some hilarious bloopers in the special features.

Michael LeSieur has written a feel good comedy and Peter Hewitt has directed that script with the help of a fine cast and the results are a fun film that has some gentle hidden messages about friendship, relationships, and loving your job.A Boston art museum is making plans to ship an exhibition of works to Denmark.  This news is hocking and upsetting to three of the museum guards: Charles (Morgan Freeman, in a subtle gender twist) is passionate for a painting of a girl with cats, Roger (Christopher) is literally enamored by a painting of a lonely girl on a beach, and military minded George (William H. Macy) is so obsessed by a bronze sculpture of an athlete that he secretly poses au natural imitating the pose of the athlete when no one is around.  When these three works are designated to be part of the shipment to Denmark the three men pop into action - they find artists to copy their beloved artworks to 'exchange' in the crates when the exhibition leaves the museum.  How they achieve this bold heist is the plot of the film.  There are many problems: the exchanged crate must contain the authentic pieces accompanied by George until the shipment leaves the museum, and Roger's intrusive wife Rose (Marcia Gay Harden) nearly aborts the boys' plan by insisting on an anniversary trip to Florida.  The heist has its problems, as the museum guards are simply good guys trying to prevent the sale of their beloved art works they guard every day. The poster line says it all: 'They're not bad guys, just bad thieves.'It is a pleasure to see three fine actors such as Freeman, Walken and Macy pull off this comedy, aided by the absurd character Marcia Gay Harden inhabits. It is well-scripted full and it is very obvious that these actors are having a great time with the film.

Walker is impassioned about his job because he is able to stand transfixed for long periods of time in front of the painting of ""The Maiden."" He even turns down his wife's repeated request that he retire and the two move to Florida. He is devastated when he hears that the museum decided to sell some of their paintings to Denmark, including ""The Maiden."" He notices Freeman, another guard, standing in front of another painting and crying. The two talk together and Freeman reveals that he loves his painting as much as Walker loves ""The Maiden."" He suggests that they find a way to steal the paintings before they are sent to Denmark. But how?Freeman brings Walker into the security room and shows him a security video, not seen by others, of a night guard who loves to stand naked and pose in front of a statue. This is Macy, who views himself as a marine fighter and military strategist. He develops a plan of how to secure copies of the two paintings and the statue and switch them with the originals when the museum is packing the art works to send to Denmark. Several things go wrong.

After years and years of emotional connectedness to their art they discover the pieces will be traveling to Denmark. When following the art, uprooting their lives to be with their paintings/statues, proves impossible, they plan the next best thing...grabbing their pieces and making them their own.Almost slapstick at times, the film moves fairly briskly after the plan is hatched and the pieces begin to fall into place. Walken is deadpan and anxious and charmingly himself. Freeman plays an accomplished painter who has painted ""his"" painting many, many times but lacks the certain aura. His cats keep him company when he is not obsessing over his lovely painting. Macy plays a military man who may or may not have served anywhere even though his tales imply near-superhero skills.Those who don't like slow-moving character pieces or artsy-quirky fun probably should skip it.

Three over-the-hill security guards each have a special fondness for a different work of art in the museum that employs them. When they find out the collection is being shipped off to Denmark, they team up to keep this travesty from happening to their ""obsessions"".So far, so good. It helps that Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman, & William H. Macy are the guards and seem to be having a great time making the movie. Add in Marcia Gay Harden playing Walken's ""battleship"" of a wife who practically steals the film that comes in at just under 90 minutes and this seems to be a can't miss event.Unfortunately, the film is betrayed by a underproduced script and a lagging pace that makes the 90 minute journey seem far longer. I was stunned to learn that this particualar script had been around for several years, yet several parts seem almost made up on the spot (and not in a ""funny, improv way"", more like a ""what do we do"" sorta thing). The ""caper"" part should be more interesting, tightly paced and play off the characters. Instead it drags at times and the resolution is so utterly predictable and lame it nearly sinks the entire picture. It doesn't help that you can see the big ""punch line"" set-up a mile away.But the picture doesn't sink and does have some fine, funny moments featuring four veteran actors who manage to pull all the entertainment value they can out of what little they have to work with. You may even find yourself (as I have) mimicing Macy's ""pose"" at times when describing the film to your friends. But it's bascially Walken's picture and he proves he can carry it with ease...well, when his ""wife"" isn't taking off with it.The DVD does include a ""Making of:"" which is rather informative and it's fun to see Morgan Freeman describe his rather off-beat character (especially considering the roles he usually plays). The Deleted Scenes are plentiful, but each one lasts less than a minute, some only a few seconds which is more like coverage that was trimmed up rather than an actual scene. The Blooper reel is short, but fairly funny in seeing actors like Freeman and Walken crack up.Really I enjoyed this movie more than I should have, which isn't a bad thing I suppose. If you enjoy seeing actors who normally get stuck supporting the ""big"" stars step out on thier own, then by all means buy this film right now.

Otherwise, the only other stand-out surprise would be William H Macy's bold outing as a bronze statue obsessed museum guard (right down to the several nude scenes where he shows off his impressive 59-year old muscular tone).The story follows three museum guards as they decide to pull off a heist of their favorite artwork after the museum sells the pieces off. Each of these guys have their own weird little nuances that make them the perfect trio of dysfunctional museum guards, but most of their backgrounds are never really delved into. Most of what we get are three old guys trying to be something more than they ever have been - but in a low-key semi-realistic kind of way. Morgan Freeman plays the affable ""sexually questionable"" (from the making-of) character which just did not feel right, and Christopher Walken really only gets to be himself in the opening sequence (a great shoot-out dream sequence - loved it). The supplements are decent and include:* 17:45 minute making-of. It is a little too heavy towards being reliant on film clips but the remaining half of the documentary gives some average background on what the four A-listers thought about their characters. Gives some good insight into why Marcia Gay Harden is so retro in this film.* 12:19 minutes of deleted scenes. Glad they were cut - especially the corny museum guard supporting cast trying to be funny.* 3 minutes of bloopers. Funny once or twice.* Commentary by the main crew. Unless you really need to know how great it is to work with the main four actors then just stick with the making of.Have to admit I love the writing at the end of the film with regards to Marcia Gay Harden's character - she is a beauty. 3.5 for the film and .5 for the extras.

The museum is going to move the pieces so they decide to make fakes and substitute them for the real pieces.

1280007,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002NO4ISG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Three Oscar winners and one nominee are in a caper comedy ""The Maiden Heist."" Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken and Willaim H. Macy are security guards in a Boston museum, who plan to steal and keep their beloved artworks to themselves when it is decided that most of the exhibits will be transferred to another museum in Denmark. Marcia Gay Harden plays Walken's wife, who suspect something strange is going on, when she finds $ 800 is missing in her cookie jar.It is reported that the distributors of ""The Maiden Heist"" went bankrupt before its release, so probably its straight-to-DVD status is due to the financial trouble. Even so, I don't think the film could have been a success, critically or commercially, had it been released theatrically, because, for all the solid acting from the leads, inept and unimaginative ""The Maiden Heist"" is at best mildly amusing.The opening ""action"" sequence is completely out of place. The heist plan itself is not very interesting, full of plot holes (cameo Breckin Meyer's painter making an exact duplicate of the painting in just five days? Without asking any questions?). But what is the most disappointing thing about ""The Maiden Heist"" is the lack of creativity and believable characters. With such iconic actors like Freeman and Walken, all the director Peter Hewitt (""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" ""Thunderpants"" ""Garfield"" ""Zoom"") does is let them deliver the lines and move on to the next scene.With four seasoned players, ""The Maiden Heist"" is a missed opportunity for a much funnier crime comedy.",2,Very Mildly Amusing,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1548,"['Three', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'one', 'nominee', 'are', 'caper', 'comedy', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Willaim', 'H.', 'Macy', 'are', 'security', 'guards', 'Boston', 'museum', 'who', 'plan', 'steal', 'keep', 'beloved', 'artworks', 'when', 'decided', 'most', 'exhibits', 'will', 'be', 'transferred', 'museum', 'Denmark', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Walken', 'wife', 'who', 'suspect', 'something', 'strange', 'going', 'when', '800', 'missing', 'cookie', 'jar.It', 'reported', 'distributors', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'release', 'so', 'probably', 'straight-to-DVD', 'status', 'due', 'financial', 'trouble', 'Even', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'success', 'critically', 'commercially', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'theatrically', 'solid', 'acting', 'leads', 'inept', 'unimaginative', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'best', 'mildly', 'amusing.The', 'opening', 'action', 'sequence', 'completely', 'place', 'heist', 'plan', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'cameo', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'painter', 'making', 'exact', 'duplicate', 'painting', 'just', 'five', 'days', 'asking', 'questions', 'what', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'lack', 'creativity', 'believable', 'characters', 'such', 'iconic', 'actors', 'Freeman', 'Walken', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hewitt', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Bogus', 'Journey', 'Thunderpants', 'Garfield', 'Zoom', 'let', 'deliver', 'lines', 'move', 'next', 'scene.With', 'four', 'seasoned', 'players', 'Maiden', 'Heist', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'much', 'funnier', 'crime', 'comedy']",The Maiden Heist
