390735,AMK0AGXC14IFM,6303937160,Debbie,"[7, 13]","Picking up this movie blindly, I had small expectations.  All of them were based on what I considered to be a fantastic cast.  A meeting of female stars like this should have brought more emotions or depth to the characters in this story, but fell terribly short with flat writing.  Becky (Elizabeth Perkins) is predictable & tough to feel anything for, as an audience member.  She is going through a large trauma in her life, but acts & reacts with no extra sorrow than anyone would have.  Lucy (Gwyneth Paltrow) as Becky's immature, ""still-finding-herself-in-college"" sister cannot be strong for Becky during this painful time.  ALberta (Kathleen Turner) is their controlling step-mother, who leads a sub-plot which went nowhere.  She is attached to these females on a regular basis, yet there seems to be no reason for her to be everywhere with them.  And Whoopi GOldberg as Becky's troubled best friend is there as a support, but also as someone carrying around a sub-plot of her own that lands short.  The up side to this film is the painter, played by Jon Bon Jovi.  He plays a small role, but in his on-screen debut, steals the show.  This film had potential to be following 4 women through a tough year in their lives, but decided to avoid being that productive & adventurous in the script.",2,"With a cast like this, it falls short.",1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1298,"['Picking', 'up', 'movie', 'blindly', 'had', 'small', 'expectations', 'were', 'based', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'meeting', 'female', 'stars', 'should', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'emotions', 'depth', 'characters', 'story', 'fell', 'terribly', 'short', 'flat', 'writing', 'Becky', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'predictable', 'tough', 'feel', 'anything', 'audience', 'member', 'going', 'large', 'trauma', 'life', 'reacts', 'extra', 'sorrow', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'Lucy', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Becky', 'immature', 'still-finding-herself-in-college', 'sister', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'strong', 'Becky', 'painful', 'time', 'ALberta', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'controlling', 'step-mother', 'who', 'sub-plot', 'went', 'nowhere', 'attached', 'females', 'regular', 'basis', 'yet', 'there', 'be', 'reason', 'be', 'everywhere', 'Whoopi', 'GOldberg', 'Becky', 'troubled', 'best', 'friend', 'there', 'support', 'also', 'someone', 'carrying', 'around', 'sub-plot', 'own', 'short', 'up', 'side', 'film', 'painter', 'played', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'small', 'role', 'on-screen', 'debut', 'show', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'following', '4', 'women', 'tough', 'year', 'lives', 'decided', 'avoid', 'being', 'productive', 'adventurous', 'script']",Moonlight and Valentino VHS

This I had to learn the hard way after giving up nearly two hours to sit through this snooze-fest.  Elizabeth Perkins is so unbelievable as a grieving widow that you'll be hard pressed to find sympathy for her.  Ms. Paltrow was lucky to have boned up on her acting skills AFTER making this film since her role as the self-absorbed younger sister did nothing for her career.  Whoopie Goldberg and Kathleen Turner spend their time as if they've arrived on the wrong movie set and are looking for where to go.  I have no idea whether I was supposed to laugh out loud or turn the DVD player off completely by the time the foursome painted their faces and did a circle of prayer in the cemetery.  This was so ridiculous that the only thing that topped it was the ""rain"" that poured down on them upon their awakening!

This is a bad chick movie. This movie is so horrid that you want to know that everyone associated with this movie  went on to become plumbers or electricians or anything but actors or  actresses or directors or writers.There is nothing honest about this  movie. The main character has a husband die in the first five minutes and  she spends the rest of the movie being depressed about it, but you don't  like her and you don't like the husband. Gwyneth Paltrow who admittedly was  pretty good in Shakespeare in Love and Seven, is truly a horrid actress in  this thing. Jon Bon Jovi is used for his physical attributes which is a  novelty, but since I am a straight male, I don't really care (although I  imagine that if I were a gay male or straight female I would be giving this  movie three stars for Bon Jovi alone)Ultimately a movie in which a bunch  of women sit around talking about their feelings - needs some feeling. All  these women do is react and speak in the cliches of soap operas. By the end  of this movie where they have some kind of pagan ceremony in the grave yard  and it rains on them with folk music blaring in the soundtrack you are  physically nauseous.
