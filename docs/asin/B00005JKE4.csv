However, I feel he gives his finest performance in &quot;Hardball.&quot; Here, he plays Conor O'Neil, a down-on-his-luck gambler/ticket scalper who's in deep with the bookies. To get out of his debts, he takes a job coaching a rag-tag band of inner city Chicago youths in their baseball league. The plot is somewhat predictable...kids who don't trust anyone, the coach who doesn't want to be there...respect eventually earned...etc., etc. Diane Lane makes a welcome return from who-knows-where as a teacher who eventually develops a close friendship with Conor. The kids, most of whom are first-time actors, add life to the story, but it's Keanu who makes the film worth watching. Here, he shows real emotion, real change, and some nice moments of comic clumsiness that will make you laugh. I don't care what people may say about my Keanu; he made me cry at the end of the film, and I felt that his charcater truly grew and changed from the coaching experience. A very good film, but, as some have said before, NOT for young children. It does take place in the Chicago Projects, and there is violence in the film.

586100,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00005JKE4,a voice of reason,"[1, 2]","""Hardball"" is another of many movies about which I have to say, ""I wanted to like it more than I did;"" at best, it may be worth watching once. Other reviewers have covered the fact that there is a bit too much cursing in the movie at times, especially by the kids in the movie, and this is one reason why it won't get any repeated viewings or more than a three-star recommendation from me.Beyond the cursing issue, however, lie some other problems. This movie tries too hard to follow too many formulas: 1) Man coaches underdogs to championship; 2) Man meets woman, loses woman, regains woman; 3) Man turns over a new leaf and finds redemption (of sorts); and 4) Life in the ghetto is hard (and often short). It's difficult to pull together so many divergent story lines in 1 hour and 46 minutes of film time, and ""Hardball"" leaves you with some blanks that you wish had been filled in.Far too much time is spent on showing us how low Keanu Reeves' character has sunk. The viewer understands that he is down and out and desperate after the first few minutes, so more time could have been spent on the coaching or romantic storylines.The kids on the baseball team, in spite of the fact that their cursing isn't as adorable as the filmmakers apparently thought it was, are the best thing about this movie, and the viewer can't help but root for their team to become winners. The problem is that we don't get to see how this happens. In spite of the facts that they are horrible in their first game and that Reeves doesn't seem to know the first thing about coaching baseball, they go on an improbable championship run. As I said, more time could have been better spent showing the interactions and growing relationship between Reeves and the kids.We also don't see much of the relationship between Reeves' and Diane Lane's characters. They are antagonists at first, and their first `date' (if you could call it that) certainly doesn't bring them closer together. Yet, by the end of the film, they appear to have grown quite close. Again, the viewer just has to accept that this has happened since it is not shown.By the end of the film, Reeves' character has a changed attitude and approach to life, and he truly cares about coaching the kids. The shooting toward the end of the film hammers home the `life in the ghetto is tough' theme and definitely stirs up the emotions of the viewer. The final outcome of the championship game is predictable and clich&eacute;d, but it couldn't have ended any other way after the shooting and it does leave the viewer feeling somewhat fulfilled (in spite of all the gaps contained in the film).",3,Too many storylines and not enough time,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,2630,"['Hardball', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'wanted', 'like', 'more', 'did', 'best', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'fact', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'cursing', 'movie', 'times', 'especially', 'kids', 'movie', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'more', 'three-star', 'recommendation', 'me.Beyond', 'cursing', 'issue', 'however', 'lie', 'other', 'problems', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'too', 'many', 'formulas', '1', 'Man', 'underdogs', 'championship', '2', 'Man', 'woman', 'woman', 'woman', '3', 'Man', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'redemption', 'sorts', '4', 'Life', 'ghetto', 'hard', 'often', 'short', 'difficult', 'pull', 'together', 'so', 'many', 'divergent', 'story', 'lines', '1', 'hour', '46', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'Hardball', 'blanks', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'filled', 'in.Far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'how', 'low', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'character', 'sunk', 'viewer', 'down', 'desperate', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'so', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'coaching', 'romantic', 'storylines.The', 'kids', 'baseball', 'team', 'spite', 'fact', 'cursing', ""n't"", 'as', 'adorable', 'filmmakers', 'apparently', 'thought', 'was', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'team', 'become', 'winners', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'spite', 'facts', 'are', 'horrible', 'first', 'game', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'coaching', 'baseball', 'go', 'improbable', 'championship', 'run', 'said', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'showing', 'interactions', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Reeves', 'kids.We', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'relationship', 'Reeves', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'characters', 'are', 'antagonists', 'first', 'first', 'date', 'could', 'call', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'bring', 'closer', 'together', 'end', 'film', 'appear', 'have', 'grown', 'quite', 'close', 'Again', 'viewer', 'just', 'accept', 'happened', 'not', 'shown.By', 'end', 'film', 'Reeves', 'character', 'changed', 'attitude', 'approach', 'life', 'truly', 'coaching', 'kids', 'shooting', 'end', 'film', 'hammers', 'home', 'life', 'ghetto', 'tough', 'theme', 'definitely', 'up', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'final', 'outcome', 'championship', 'game', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'ended', 'other', 'way', 'shooting', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'fulfilled', 'spite', 'gaps', 'contained', 'film']",N/A

Desperate for money he accepts a job coaching a baseball team consisting of ghetto kids at the sum of $500 a week for 10 weeks. (That's over NZ$1000 a week for coaching kids. Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?). Predictably O'Neil first sees this as just another job, but soon he finds he enjoys the coaching and giving these underprivelaged kids hope. You can guess the rest of the story without too much trouble: among the token players are The Gangsta Rap fan, The Swearer and the obligatory Fat Kid; all of which go a long way toward displaying screenwriter John Gattin's gift for strong characterisation. It's rare that a true story, based on Daniel Coyle's book about his real life experiences should be so formulaic and predictable. Of course the inevitable tragedys are thrown in to manipulate sensitive viewers, as well as the expected triumph over adversity.HARDBALL is a movie which will be loved by people who only see one or two films a year. This is basically a less amusing spin on THE BAD NEWS BEARS, but despite that HARDBALL is still a reasonably entertaining film. The kids do a good job, and Diane Lane is excellent as well as SEX-Y; but sadly, Reeves is awful. Early on a drunken Keanu punches through both a car window AND a store window- all without severing any major arteries OR displaying one iota of acting talent.

I found this kind of soppy pep-talk, which is scattered all about &quot;Hardball&quot;, to be pretentious and formulaic.&quot;Hardball&quot; is the kind of sports drama that's been done about a thousand times before. Its got an unpleasant ring to it that makes it feel like &quot;The Mighty Ducks play Baseball.&quot; For those of you interested in the plot, it mainly concerns Keanu Reeves as a troubled gambler indebted to several different bookies. In order to get some money, he agrees to coach a baseball team from the projects. They are horrible, and he has a very limited knowledge of anything having to do with baseball.The film starts off uninteresting and stays that way. It seems to have no emotional arc, because even though things happen, they are presented in an uneven and derivative way. For example, there is supposed to be a romance between Reeves's character and Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane), but in no way is it romantic. After one and a half hours it still goes nowhere. It seems like director Brian Robbins doesn't know the rules of dramatic suspense, either. There are quite a few scenes where something big is about to happen, and then the scene just ends. Building up suspense is step one, but you can't satisfy a viewer without a climax. Even after we know what happened in the time we missed, we still feel discontented. How are we supposed to feel happy for someone when it seems like what we're told is unimportant?And then there are the kids. The actors do a good job, considering how stale their roles are. Something about all sports films featuring kids that irks me is how one-dimensional they almost always are. &quot;Hardball&quot; is no exception. The kids' entire reason for being rests on one characteristic. For example, this kid is the one with asthma; this one always wears his headphones; this is the little cute one. I would love to see a film that would be able to handle the task of fleshing out its multiple child characters; &quot;Hardball&quot; is obviously not that film.&quot;Hardball&quot; isn't a horrible film, but it doesn't take us anywhere. Were lead to believe that the characters progress to a more mature state, but nothing of that kind is emoted from the actors. The direction is too confused to successfully create a nice, solid work. &quot;Hardball&quot; will work for some, but if you can't stand bad melodrama (or Keanu Reeves' acting, for that matter), this film isn't for you.",2,Keanu Reeves flaunts his repellent &quot;acting&quot; skills,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2709,"['quot', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'showing', 'up', 'quot', 'Conor', ""O'Neill"", 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'little', 'league', 'baseball', 'team', 'coaching', 'quot', ""'m"", 'blown', 'away', 'ability', 'show', 'up.', 'quot', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'suits', 'tastes', 'so', 'be', 'found', 'kind', 'soppy', 'pep-talk', 'scattered', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', 'be', 'pretentious', 'formulaic.', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', 'kind', 'sports', 'drama', 'been', 'done', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'got', 'unpleasant', 'ring', 'feel', 'quot', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'play', 'Baseball.', 'quot', 'interested', 'plot', 'mainly', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'troubled', 'gambler', 'indebted', 'several', 'different', 'bookies', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'coach', 'baseball', 'team', 'projects', 'are', 'horrible', 'very', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'baseball.The', 'film', 'uninteresting', 'stays', 'way', 'have', 'emotional', 'arc', 'even', 'things', 'happen', 'are', 'presented', 'uneven', 'derivative', 'way', 'example', 'supposed', 'be', 'romance', 'Reeves', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilkes', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'way', 'romantic', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'still', 'nowhere', 'director', 'Brian', 'Robbins', ""n't"", 'know', 'rules', 'dramatic', 'suspense', 'either', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'something', 'big', 'happen', 'then', 'scene', 'just', 'Building', 'up', 'suspense', 'step', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'viewer', 'climax', 'Even', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'time', 'missed', 'still', 'feel', 'discontented', 'How', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'happy', 'someone', 'when', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'unimportant', 'then', 'are', 'kids', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'how', 'stale', 'roles', 'are', 'Something', 'sports', 'films', 'featuring', 'kids', 'irks', 'how', 'one-dimensional', 'almost', 'always', 'are', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', 'exception', 'kids', 'entire', 'reason', 'being', 'rests', 'one', 'characteristic', 'example', 'kid', 'one', 'asthma', 'one', 'always', 'headphones', 'little', 'cute', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'task', 'fleshing', 'out', 'multiple', 'child', 'characters', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', 'obviously', 'not', 'film.', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'anywhere', 'Were', 'lead', 'believe', 'characters', 'progress', 'more', 'mature', 'state', 'nothing', 'kind', 'emoted', 'actors', 'direction', 'too', 'confused', 'successfully', 'create', 'nice', 'solid', 'work', 'quot', 'Hardball', 'quot', 'will', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'bad', 'melodrama', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'matter', 'film', ""n't""]",N/A

What is different about Hardballs than other similar movies about kids baseball teams?It's about taking chances (more than just gambling), and shooting down some stereotypes about people - kids who don't care or don't study, parents who aren't aware of what their kids are doing, etc. There is a boy on the team whose mother only allows him to play baseball if Connor will agree to help the boy read the books he is assigned and keep up in class. One of the best scenes off the field was when the boy is called upon in class and since he is silent, he is assumed to have NOT read the book. When he finally speaks, it's rewarding to both the teacher, Connor, and the audience.The kids on the team (the Kekambas) learn to take a chance on each other; we don't get to see much of the process of their learning to encourage one another and learning NOT to back-talk or argue with one another, but we do get a glimpse of how Connor tries to guide them away from teasing that hurts to being teammates that help one another. Not only does Connor take a chance by leaving what he knows of gambling behind to help the kids on his team, but the kids (and in some cases, the parents, and the kids' teacher) really take a chance on Connor, too.

Litton,"[1, 3]","If you can't buy Keanu Reeves as a gambler-turned-baseball coach, then you're going to have a tough time sitting through ""Hardball,"" which puts the actor in basically the same life-changing situation found in his previous film, ""Sweet November."" There, he was a workaholic who found meaning in a relationship with a cancer-stricken humanitarian. Here, he's a down-on-his-luck gambler/alcoholic who finds himself coaching a down-on-their-luck baseball team.That's not to say that the movie gets away with this change easily; there are many drawbacks to Reeve's character, Conor O'Neill, who becomes increasingly in debt to loan sharks and thugs who, when they haven't received payment, begin to make house calls. Of course, Conor makes more bets in hopes of paying off his old ones, only digging his grave deeper when he keeps losing money. He turns to an old friend, who offers him $500 a week to coach a little league team while is away on business.Now, any parent with a head on their shoulders wouldn't think of trusting their children with such an irresponsible man. Conor, as seen by the audience, is little more than a repulsive, incessantly stupid character with no sense of moral value, but this is easily overlooked because the members of the baseball team are all prepubescent African-American boys who live in the projects.As you may have already guessed from previews and commercials, tam and coach go through a standard getting-to-know-you period, followed by the requisite high spirits that lead to various wins and, ultimately, a chance to play in the playoffs. This might actually be convincing if the movie didn't try to pass off pizza parties, a Walkman that plays Notorious B.I.G., and the constant use of profanities by the adolescent players as practice sessions and moments of inspiration.The main problem with ""Hardball"" is that we have no reason to care much for its characters. Conor, despite some worthy acting by Reeves, doesn't really maintain the moral turnaround needed for us to accept his change of heart, while the baseball players, bless their hearts, are merely players in the movie's game of bringing to light a clich&eacute;, overused message. And then, of course, there's the love interest between Reeves and school teacher Diane Lane, who does a serviceable job with what she's given.The surprise trophy of the film is its ending, which really deserves a better film. Without revealing too much, I will say that, despite its conventional feel, there are some good moments of heartfelt emotion that make us wonder just what went wrong in the beginning and mid-sections. The banal characters? The tedious, familiar plotting?

Keanu accepts because he desperatly needs the money otherwise he'll get himself into more trouble. When he gets there he is left by himself with these kids. When the one kid goes home he sees gangs and gets really nervous. He walks really quick so he doesn't get hurt. Then two kids knock him down and take his stuff.This movie is very moving at the end.

Meaning, I wasn't expecting much from this film. It flopped at the box office, and was released after Keanu Reeves hit the second highlight of his career: The Matrix. Instead, I found myself really liking this film. OK, so some of the kids were really hard to understand, but I was smiling most of the time.Keanu Reeves plays a character very similar to the characters he played in Feeling Minnesota &amp; The Last Time I Committed Suicide. Characters that I was never very keen on. They smoke, they drink, they get beaten up. Keanu Reeves is all of this in the film. He has no friends, except ones who are after him for money, he doesn't have a girlfriend, and he is very much portrayed as an alcholic chain-smoker. So why did I buy this film? Cos it was on sale. I seem to like buying rubbish films that are on sale.But I liked this. I really did. The kids are cute and fun, and even though it was mainly a film about sport, it doesn't focus too much on the subject, and its about a sport I can actually understand!The kids are great, despite the swearing and the fact that some of them don't look old enough to know what they're saying actually means. They seem to really connect with Keanu's character, and you can also see this in the behind the scenes in the extras.There are a few underlying stories in this, which could have been brought more to the forefront, instead of letting dwell in the background. These include the love story between Keanu Reeves &amp; Diane Lane, the kids families, the school ...Three quarters of the way through this, I had tears streaming down my face. Surprisingly enough, Keanu does NOT die, despite what people think. But it is sad, and I won't spoil it for anyone, but I was crying. It's so sad and so sweet. And Keanu manages to shed tears!!! Not something he's really attempted before, or attempted successfully.We also get a topless Keanu wandering around with just a towel round his waist (yum), showing off his very noticeable scar from the motorbike accident. And a tattoo?! I think this was on for the movie, as I've never known him to have a tattoo before, but why would the make up artists go to the bother of putting a tattoo on him just for one scene. I'll be curious to see if he did get a tattoo. It looks like a very cool design.If you're a sport fan, you probably won't enjoy this.

In HARDBALL, Reeves tends to prove this critic wrong.  Granted, Reeves will probably never see an Oscar on his mantelpiece, but he has shown considerable growth over the years.  (See:  THE GIFT, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE for example).  In this one, he takes a character who we immediately dislike and turns him into a guy we can root for.  The main problem is it is hard to feel sorry for a guy whose life is crap because he can't seem to stop gambling; he doesn't have a job, it appears and he expects everyone to feel sorry for him.  Sorry, dude....can't go there with you.  His assignment to coach the ragtag bunch of lower class kids at first seems too contrived to be convincing, but as the movie goes along and Reeves becomes a heroic figure to these tragic children, we can see and feel more for both Reeves and the kids.  HARDBALL is also smart enough not to become a ""sports"" movie per se; it has some charming moments such as the pitcher who needs the rap song to throw a dangerously fast curve ball.  But in crucial moments, it doesn't drag out the game inning by inning, and the final two games are anti-cliche in the direction they take.  The film has a surprising tragic twist at the end and it will work your tear ducts, but the movie ends on an upbeat note, and avoids the standard cliches involved.Diane Lane has a supporting role, but it's not fleshed out enough to have an impact; John Hawkes as Ticky is good, as is Mike McGlone as the smooth Jimmy Fleming.  The kids are all competent, and do what they are supposed to do.  Reeves handles the funeral scene quite eloquently.All in all, HARDBALL does what it set out to do and for that reason, is an entertaining movie.",3,THE OLD BALL GAME,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,1793,"['recent', 'MSN', 'review', 'Constantine', 'critic', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'HARDBALL', 'Reeves', 'prove', 'critic', 'wrong', 'Granted', 'Reeves', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'Oscar', 'mantelpiece', 'shown', 'considerable', 'growth', 'years', 'See', 'GIFT', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'ADVOCATE', 'example', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'immediately', 'dislike', 'guy', 'can', 'root', 'main', 'problem', 'hard', 'feel', 'sorry', 'guy', 'life', 'crap', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'gambling', ""n't"", 'have', 'job', 'everyone', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Sorry', 'dude', '.ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'assignment', 'coach', 'ragtag', 'bunch', 'lower', 'class', 'kids', 'first', 'too', 'contrived', 'be', 'convincing', 'movie', 'along', 'Reeves', 'heroic', 'figure', 'tragic', 'children', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'more', 'Reeves', 'kids', 'HARDBALL', 'also', 'smart', 'enough', 'not', 'become', 'sports', 'movie', 'se', 'charming', 'moments', 'such', 'pitcher', 'who', 'rap', 'song', 'throw', 'dangerously', 'fast', 'curve', 'ball', 'crucial', 'moments', ""n't"", 'drag', 'out', 'game', 'inning', 'inning', 'final', 'two', 'games', 'are', 'anti-cliche', 'direction', 'take', 'film', 'surprising', 'tragic', 'twist', 'end', 'will', 'work', 'tear', 'ducts', 'movie', 'upbeat', 'note', 'standard', 'cliches', 'involved.Diane', 'Lane', 'supporting', 'role', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'have', 'impact', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Ticky', 'good', 'Mike', 'McGlone', 'smooth', 'Jimmy', 'Fleming', 'kids', 'are', 'competent', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'Reeves', 'funeral', 'scene', 'quite', 'HARDBALL', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'reason', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

This is what is ultimately the problem with &quot;Hardball,&quot; a wildly uneven and highly cliched movie. Oh yes, and the movie also stars one of successes greatest enigmas: Keanu Reeves. Many hailed his performance in &quot;Hardball&quot; as the greatest performance of his career... Trust me, folks: That MUST not be saying much.&quot;Hardball&quot; tells the story of a man named Connor O'Neal (Keanu Reeves' brilliant character) who has a gambling problem that is portrayed very intensely. So intensely, in fact, that it would make for a fantastic and highly disturbing independant film. Unfortunately, this film was marketed as a family film, so it only comes across as highly disturbing without the fantastic.Anyway, Connor O'Neal (through a few contrived plot twists) ends up coaching an inner city baseball team composed of foul-mouthed children. The child actors portraying these kids do convincing performances and come off very loveable and playful, making them one of the movie's few strengths.Once again, &quot;Hardball's&quot; biggest fault minus Keanu and his &quot;acting&quot; is the fact that the movie tries to be too many things at once. It goes for intense, then it goes for playful, then it goes for fun, then it goes for thrilling, then it goes for romantic, then it goes for comedy, then it goes for tear-jerking, then it goes for pride, and etc. etc. etc. And all within about an hour-and-a-half's time.

They could have had more interesting interaction, have foiled eachother more, or had better chemistry.

586172,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00005JKE4,Sheryl Fechter,"[5, 6]","I found this Chicago based baseball movie different than most involving children's teams.  This bunch of disbelieving kids didn't quite need their coach as much as Coach Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) needed them.  Diane Lane enters the mix portraying their school teacher with a much shorter screen time.  They begin a relationship that does not find itself very developed in the long run although it works well with the story:  An uninspired replacement coach and the unlikely young team that turns his life around.I liked this because the focus remained on the children's relationship with their coach.  Although this leaves the door wide open for the budding couple at the ending, the movie closes in almost entirely on the strong emotional pull these boys have on Conor.  They must overcome many hardships to find their place within their own selves and in their surrounding lives.Conor gets coerced into coaching because of having to pay off his ever increasing gambling debts.  The team starts out quite poorly on the field and looked to me that they would need an incredible amount of development to become cohesive as a team.  When Conor starts as their reluctant coach, they immediately begin to play well rendering the point of needing each other and making a quick connection.The real expressed character development befalls Coach Conor O'Neill, who definitely requires a lead in story and gets a fairly detailed one.  This is a small story that actually roars.  Reeves shows a lot of range in his emotions and personal growth with the team, with his life, his past, even vaguely with Lane.  Before watching the film I wasn't too sure of the rating.  After viewing it I feel this movie couldn't really convey all that it does without the language and intensity in the amount of violence shown.  These young boys live among the bullets, gangs, and turbulence of the inner-city projects.The movie becomes more real to you and endearing as it goes along.  At first Conor isn't a character that I would really want to know.  One sees just how desperate he actually is with an all encompassing gambling problem; irresponsibly owing money all over Chicago and with many loan sharks.  He first appears uncaring and aloof towards everyone unless he's on a winning streak.  Changing quickly, Conor begins to deeply feel within his newly found position and emotes inspiration from his coaching.  These are very special boys, and now realizing how much his life must change he understands how much he  needs them to be in his life.  It is here where you see the great amount of heart which is involved in this movie.This could be a great family movie all depending on your tolerance of the language and the intense look at the streets of inner-city Chicago.  I immensely enjoyed this realistic and, at times, difficult story enough to add it to my personal movie collection.",5,Keanu Reeves And His Baseball Team Together Are A Natural ...,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2873,"['found', 'Chicago', 'based', 'baseball', 'movie', 'different', 'most', 'involving', 'children', 'teams', 'bunch', 'disbelieving', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'need', 'coach', 'as', 'much', 'Coach', 'Conor', ""O'Neill"", 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'needed', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'mix', 'portraying', 'school', 'teacher', 'much', 'shorter', 'screen', 'time', 'begin', 'relationship', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'developed', 'long', 'run', 'well', 'story', 'uninspired', 'replacement', 'coach', 'unlikely', 'young', 'team', 'life', 'around.I', 'liked', 'focus', 'remained', 'children', 'relationship', 'coach', 'door', 'wide', 'open', 'budding', 'couple', 'ending', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'strong', 'emotional', 'pull', 'boys', 'have', 'Conor', 'must', 'overcome', 'many', 'hardships', 'find', 'place', 'own', 'selves', 'surrounding', 'lives.Conor', 'coerced', 'coaching', 'having', 'pay', 'off', 'ever', 'increasing', 'gambling', 'debts', 'team', 'out', 'quite', 'poorly', 'field', 'looked', 'would', 'need', 'incredible', 'amount', 'development', 'become', 'cohesive', 'team', 'When', 'Conor', 'reluctant', 'coach', 'immediately', 'begin', 'play', 'well', 'rendering', 'point', 'needing', 'other', 'making', 'quick', 'connection.The', 'real', 'expressed', 'character', 'development', 'befalls', 'Coach', 'Conor', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'definitely', 'lead', 'story', 'fairly', 'detailed', 'one', 'small', 'story', 'actually', 'Reeves', 'lot', 'range', 'emotions', 'personal', 'growth', 'team', 'life', 'past', 'even', 'vaguely', 'Lane', 'watching', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'rating', 'viewing', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'convey', 'language', 'intensity', 'amount', 'violence', 'shown', 'young', 'boys', 'live', 'bullets', 'gangs', 'turbulence', 'inner-city', 'projects.The', 'movie', 'more', 'real', 'endearing', 'along', 'first', 'Conor', ""n't"", 'character', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'One', 'just', 'how', 'desperate', 'actually', 'encompassing', 'gambling', 'problem', 'irresponsibly', 'owing', 'money', 'Chicago', 'many', 'loan', 'sharks', 'first', 'uncaring', 'aloof', 'towards', 'everyone', 'winning', 'streak', 'Changing', 'quickly', 'Conor', 'deeply', 'feel', 'newly', 'found', 'position', 'inspiration', 'coaching', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'boys', 'now', 'realizing', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'must', 'change', 'how', 'much', 'be', 'life', 'here', 'where', 'see', 'great', 'amount', 'heart', 'involved', 'movie.This', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'depending', 'tolerance', 'language', 'intense', 'look', 'streets', 'inner-city', 'Chicago', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'realistic', 'times', 'difficult', 'story', 'enough', 'add', 'personal', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A
