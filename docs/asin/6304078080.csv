399346,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6304078080,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[0, 0]","Amazing that this film came out nearly twenty years ago (1995) and it took me this long to finally watch it! Cry, the Beloved Country came out one year following the South African Apartheid reforms in 1994. This was when the separatist approach to syphoning off and separating non-Europeans from Europeans in that part of the world was finally overruled. Apartheid was literally a systematic and structured social institution in South African society bent on upholding the idea that Blacks, Whites and other ethnicities were not only unequal but were not to intermingle with each other socially (or any other way). The culture of Johannesburg, the townships and other areas was one of intensity, violence and oppression. In the wake of the reforms, Truth & Reconciliation Commissions took place. This was the opportunity for victims of this enforced racism to give testimony as to the violence they had experienced. Blacks speaking of unbelievable human rights violations and other atrocities, White preachers speaking of torture and acts of aggression and violence against their person.Cry, the Beloved Country is set in 1946 and the rolling hills of the nation are a beautiful backdrop for less than beautiful acts of hatred between people, as well as the stoicism and bravery that peace loving men continue to uphold in the face of darkness and discouragement. Two fathers (James Earl Jones and Richard Harris) are brought together due to tragic circumstances. One is a preacher of peace and the other is a wealthy landowner. They are also from different backgrounds at a time where it is unheard of for Blacks and Whites to barely speak to each other. In spite of the turbulence, they make space for a peaceful bond to build - almost like an oasis for reconciliation.The acting is superb, the beautiful landscape is so rich with color and dimension and it transfers so well to the television screen. This is definitely not a film that requires going to the movie theater for full effect. I wish more films existed like this. The times are so difficult and director Darrell James Roodt beautifully recreates the novel written by Alan Paton with his actors.

During that time I seldom questioned he fact that black people were living humbly and in poverty while we whites enjoyed a high standard of living, using them as cheap labour. It was the correct order of things that coloured people knew their place. They were to be treated with Christian kindness and provided with a basic education and health care. Of course in separate institutions from ours.The film precedes the change when the Afrikaner Nationalist government gained power. They were filled with hate. They were the descendants of the Boers and kept reminding people how they had suffered under the Black tribes (eight 'Kaffir' Wars) and by the 'English' (Boer War). They succeeded in removing the scales from my  eyes. I became aware of the plight of black people and horrified by the brutality towards them.I left my beloved country in despair, never to live there again.

I love action movies, I love well executed sci-fi thrillers . . . so why on earth would I rate this as my favorite film of all time? . . .. . .Because one gets to a point in one's life when movies or any art for that matter, isn't about how much one is shocked, or how &quot;entertained&quot; one becomes . . . watching movies becomes like a mature appreciation of alcohol: one drinks and appreciates until satisfaction; not to become inebriated.This film is the single most satisfying piece of visual art (besides the Brothers Karamazov, if that is visual art) I have ever experienced in my life.  In metaphor to the prodigal son, the film deals with not only racial reconciliation, but much more importantly the deepest behavioral issues and ethos of agape: intense love for a family member.This is the single most redemptive film I have ever seen.  The performances are riveting and non-cliched, and the cinematography is fascinatingly spectacular.  Richard Harris delivers a breathtakingly believable portrayal of a rich white racist (of sorts) whose acting is really put to the test in incredible subtle and emotionally charged interplays between the novels colorful characters.James Earl Jones' presence is nothing short of phenomenal.  His performance is so captivating that tt seems that he might actually have been through a similar occurance in his own life.Of all the incredible movies that have been made, this is my favorite film.

I felt like I popped in a handful of Poignant Pills after I saw this film.I could use words like captivating, rapturous or brilliant to describe the screenplay, the acting, the mood of this film; but I'm not going to. To do so would be wrong, for this film does something that most films can not - it speaks for itself.In it, we have two fathers. One, a minister (Earl Jones) during apartheid in South Africa. Another (Harris) is a rich man who never understood his son. When the pastor's son fearfully and regretfully kills the rich man's son, we witness the human condition at its frailest core. The pastor's shame all but consumes him while the rich man is more pained by the fact that he never was able to know his son who so painstakingly worked to restore racial harmony long before it was popular. Instead of adding to the pastor's guilt, grief and pain at what his son has done, he restores him by graciously forgiving the man and his child. It is as if each man knows his place and is unwilling to move above it. Jones' character cannot forgive himself for what his son has done and Harris' character cannot forgive himself for refusing to reach a bit further into his boy's life. They find healing in one another, and this adds to the tone of the film.This film is altogether amazing, both story-wise and visually.

Holben,"[0, 1]","So many reviewers have praised this film as one of the best movies, if not the best movie, ever made, that one almost feels guilty expressing reservations about it.  And then there's the subject matter, which dares you not to treat it with reverence.  And, on top of all that, Nelson Mandela liked it!But the fact is, for all its obviously high aspirations, when considered as a film rather than a moral or spiritual event, ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" is a very mixed bag.  John Barry's score is lovely and the photography of the South African countryside is gorgeous.  The period (1946) is nicely done.  But the script is a muddle ... James Earl Jones's character (a rural Anglican priest) heads into the big city on not one but four quests: to find his son (who turns out to have comitted a murder in a botched robbery attempt), to reconnect with his brother (who has abandoned Christianity for political action), to find his sister (she's become a prostitute), and to find another woman whose connection with him was never made entirely clear, at least to me (she's never found, her only plot function seems to be to allow her former white mistress to express utter disinterest in her whereabouts).  Richard Harris's character, a crusty white farmer whose liberal son is murdered (by Jones's son, it turns out), has a sudden and not particularly convincing transformation from racial bigot to sensitive liberal -- the turning point apparently being getting a good long look at Jones's suffering face with tears running down those massive cheeks.  Conincidences abound and the son's guilt -- he readily admits to the murder, but keeps insisting he didn't mean to do it, he was simply afraid (while attempting a robbery, it should be remembered)-- seems somehow minimized both by the son and the script, as if being a victim of the appalling racial system of that time and not going into the robbery intending to commit murder are sufficient to be morally exonerating.And apart from the script, Jones's performance was for me -- contrary to many of the other reviews -- one of the biggest problems with the film.  It's as if he's performing under water or slogging his way through thigh-deep mud.  Every line, every pause (and there are a lot of pauses), every gesture seems to be in slow motion.  Apparently Jones and his director were aiming for some sort of transcendent dignity or spirituality, but the performance, like Jones's out-of-the-cavern voice, is ponderous and ultimately sucks much, if not all, of the life out of the film.""Cry, the Beloved Country"" obviously intends to make a ""big"" statement about apartheid and reconciliation, but apart from the occasional callous remark from a white character, the systemic degredation of blacks under that system is curiously muffled.  Most of the cruelties we see inflicted are black-on-black.  And, as already noted, the big moment of reconciliation between Harris's white farmer and Jones's black priest felt too quick, too easy, and finally unconvincing.Contrary to the more negative reviews, this film is not a complete waste of time, but it feels twice its length and left this viewer curiouisly unmoved, despite its admirable intentions.",3,"Good intentions, ponderous result.",1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,3198,"['So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'praised', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'almost', 'feels', 'guilty', 'expressing', 'reservations', 'then', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'treat', 'reverence', 'top', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'liked', 'fact', 'obviously', 'high', 'aspirations', 'when', 'considered', 'film', 'rather', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'event', 'Cry', 'Beloved', 'Country', 'very', 'mixed', 'bag', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'lovely', 'photography', 'South', 'African', 'countryside', 'gorgeous', 'period', '1946', 'nicely', 'done', 'script', 'muddle', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'character', 'rural', 'Anglican', 'priest', 'big', 'city', 'not', 'one', 'four', 'quests', 'find', 'son', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'comitted', 'murder', 'botched', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'brother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'Christianity', 'political', 'action', 'find', 'sister', 'become', 'prostitute', 'find', 'woman', 'connection', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'entirely', 'clear', 'least', 'never', 'found', 'only', 'plot', 'function', 'be', 'allow', 'former', 'white', 'mistress', 'express', 'utter', 'disinterest', 'whereabouts', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'character', 'crusty', 'white', 'farmer', 'liberal', 'son', 'murdered', 'Jones', 'son', 'out', 'sudden', 'not', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'transformation', 'racial', 'bigot', 'sensitive', 'liberal', 'turning', 'point', 'apparently', 'being', 'getting', 'good', 'long', 'look', 'Jones', 'suffering', 'face', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'massive', 'cheeks', 'Conincidences', 'abound', 'son', 'guilt', 'readily', 'murder', 'insisting', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', 'was', 'simply', 'afraid', 'attempting', 'robbery', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'somehow', 'minimized', 'son', 'script', 'being', 'victim', 'appalling', 'racial', 'system', 'time', 'not', 'going', 'robbery', 'intending', 'commit', 'murder', 'are', 'sufficient', 'be', 'morally', 'exonerating.And', 'apart', 'script', 'Jones', 'performance', 'was', 'contrary', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'performing', 'water', 'slogging', 'way', 'thigh-deep', 'mud', 'line', 'pause', 'are', 'lot', 'pauses', 'gesture', 'be', 'slow', 'motion', 'Apparently', 'Jones', 'director', 'were', 'aiming', 'sort', 'transcendent', 'dignity', 'spirituality', 'performance', 'Jones', 'out-of-the-cavern', 'voice', 'ponderous', 'ultimately', 'sucks', 'much', 'not', 'life', 'film', 'Cry', 'Beloved', 'Country', 'obviously', 'make', 'big', 'statement', 'apartheid', 'reconciliation', 'apart', 'occasional', 'callous', 'remark', 'white', 'character', 'systemic', 'degredation', 'blacks', 'system', 'curiously', 'muffled', 'Most', 'cruelties', 'see', 'inflicted', 'are', 'black-on-black', 'already', 'noted', 'big', 'moment', 'reconciliation', 'Harris', 'white', 'farmer', 'Jones', 'black', 'priest', 'felt', 'too', 'quick', 'too', 'easy', 'finally', 'unconvincing.Contrary', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'twice', 'length', 'left', 'viewer', 'curiouisly', 'unmoved', 'admirable', 'intentions']",Cry the Beloved Country VHS
399357,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304078080,Lawyeraau,"[72, 74]","This adaptation of Alan Paton's best selling novel is superior to the 1951 version starring Sidney Poitier, though that earlier adaptation is also excellent. Here, Richard Harris gives a sharply drawn performance as a hard nosed, well to do landowner in South Africa with a somewhat negative attitude toward the native population. James Earl Jones gives a beautifully nuanced, sensitive performance as a simple, country preacher who is described by a colleague as simply the &quot;best man he ever met&quot;.The story takes place in 1946. The preacher temporaily leaves his flock and family to go to Johannesburg  to search for his brother, his sister, and his son, Absalom. For those who are well versed in the Bible, the name &quot;Absalom&quot; is not without significance.He finds all three, but too late. His brother has turned away from the church and become involved in racial politics. His sister has turned to prostitution, and his son has become involved with less than salubrious companions.The landowner lives in the same countryside as the preacher, and he, too, has a son. As did the preacher's son, his had also migrated to Johannesburg, and was a well known city engineer, as well as an altruist dedicated to helping the native population. Unfortunately, the son ends up murdered in his own home by a gang of natives, one of whom is Absalom.While the landowner and the preacher may have been from the same area and their paths may have crossed, they had never before spoken to one another, until their paths tragically intersected through their sons: one murdered, the other, the murderer. Their respective journeys to reach their sons serves to starkly draw the contrast between White and Black South Africa. In fact, this is essentially the story of two South Africas, one White, the other, Black.It is also the story of two fathers, each finding that his son is lost to him forever. What follows is the struggle of each father to understand what happened, and the reasons why it may have happened in the bigger context. Ultimately, they are just fathers, united in sorrow, as they never could have been in life, at least not in South Africa; neither of whom comprehends the new order of things to come. Yet, as each discovers who his son had been, a new understanding dawns upon them and a barrier is surmounted.There is an inadvertent meeting between the two fathers while in Johannesburg, that is one of the most moving scenes of any film, carried by the affecting performances of Harris and Jones. It is a moment that is certainly not lost on the viewer. There is also one other scene where the fathers meet again, back in the countryside where they are from. Again, Harris and Jones create a mood that bespeaks volumes, such is their talent.This is an incredible and memorable film that should not be missed. Harris and Jones are supported by Charles Dutton, who gives a dynamic performance as the preacher's errant brother, and by a largely unknown cast who are uniformly excellent. This is a quality film from beginning to end.",5,A MAGNIFICENT  AND MOVING FILM...,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,3052,"['adaptation', 'Alan', 'Paton', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'superior', '1951', 'version', 'starring', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'earlier', 'adaptation', 'also', 'excellent', 'Here', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'performance', 'hard', 'nosed', 'well', 'do', 'landowner', 'South', 'Africa', 'somewhat', 'negative', 'attitude', 'native', 'population', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'simple', 'country', 'preacher', 'who', 'described', 'colleague', 'simply', 'quot', 'best', 'man', 'ever', 'met', 'quot', 'story', 'place', '1946', 'preacher', 'temporaily', 'flock', 'family', 'go', 'Johannesburg', 'search', 'brother', 'sister', 'son', 'Absalom', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'Bible', 'name', 'quot', 'Absalom', 'quot', 'not', 'significance.He', 'finds', 'three', 'too', 'late', 'brother', 'turned', 'away', 'church', 'become', 'involved', 'racial', 'politics', 'sister', 'turned', 'prostitution', 'son', 'become', 'involved', 'less', 'salubrious', 'companions.The', 'landowner', 'same', 'countryside', 'preacher', 'too', 'son', 'did', 'preacher', 'son', 'had', 'also', 'migrated', 'Johannesburg', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'city', 'engineer', 'as', 'well', 'altruist', 'dedicated', 'helping', 'native', 'population', 'Unfortunately', 'son', 'up', 'murdered', 'own', 'home', 'gang', 'natives', 'one', 'whom', 'Absalom.While', 'landowner', 'preacher', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'area', 'paths', 'may', 'have', 'crossed', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'spoken', 'one', 'paths', 'tragically', 'intersected', 'sons', 'one', 'murdered', 'other', 'murderer', 'respective', 'journeys', 'reach', 'sons', 'starkly', 'draw', 'contrast', 'White', 'Black', 'South', 'Africa', 'fact', 'essentially', 'story', 'two', 'South', 'Africas', 'one', 'White', 'other', 'Black.It', 'also', 'story', 'two', 'fathers', 'finding', 'son', 'lost', 'forever', 'What', 'struggle', 'father', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'reasons', 'why', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'bigger', 'context', 'Ultimately', 'are', 'just', 'fathers', 'united', 'sorrow', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'life', 'least', 'not', 'South', 'Africa', 'whom', 'new', 'order', 'things', 'come', 'Yet', 'discovers', 'who', 'son', 'had', 'been', 'new', 'understanding', 'dawns', 'barrier', 'surmounted.There', 'inadvertent', 'meeting', 'two', 'fathers', 'Johannesburg', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'film', 'carried', 'affecting', 'performances', 'Harris', 'Jones', 'moment', 'certainly', 'not', 'lost', 'viewer', 'also', 'one', 'other', 'scene', 'where', 'fathers', 'meet', 'again', 'back', 'countryside', 'where', 'are', 'Again', 'Harris', 'Jones', 'create', 'mood', 'volumes', 'such', 'talent.This', 'incredible', 'memorable', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Harris', 'Jones', 'are', 'supported', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'who', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'preacher', 'errant', 'brother', 'largely', 'unknown', 'cast', 'who', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'quality', 'film', 'beginning', 'end']",Cry the Beloved Country VHS

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[24, 25]","Darrell Roodt chose carefully when it was time to direct the first film of South Africa after the abolition of Apartheid.  Alan Paton's novel was first filmed in 1951, and ""Cry the Beloved Country"" is a tale that seems as much a part of the South African collective zeitgeist as Twain or Hemingway or Steinbeck is part of America's.This film version is centered around perhaps James Earl Jones' most powerful screen performance.  He stars as the Reverend Stephen Kumalo, a clergyman from a small town in South Africa.  He is a strong man of faith and leads a congregation in matters both religious and practical.  His son ran away to Johannesburg to work in the mines, and his sister went away also to join her husband.  His brother, John, is also in the city, an outspoken black activist who has abandoned the ways of religion because religion is not creating justice for blacks. The film opens with Reverend Kumalo receiving word that things are not all well in Johannesburg.Richard Harris has the role of James Jarvis, a wealthy white landowner from the same small town.  His son has also gone to Johannesburg, where he works as an activist trying to improve the repressed condition of the South African Blacks who are only starting to come under the evil thumb of Apartheid.The whites and blacks are so separate that although they are two of the most prominent figures in a small town, Mr. Jarvis and the Reverend Kumalo have not even met as the movie opens.  Tragedy strikes, more than once, and without spoiling the plot I'll just reveal that it involves the two sons of these two characters.Roodt goes out of his way to display the noble suffering of Reverend Kumalo.  He never speaks a discouraging word, even when confronting terrible injustice.  The story hinges on Kumalo's innate goodness, and Mr. Jones brings this to life in a way that carries the story along.It is worth mentioning a single scene - the one in which Kumalo and Jarvis first meet.  The previously mentioned tragedy has already occurred and both men are in a kind of mourning.  Kumalo knows Jarvis while Jarvis vaguely recognizes Kumalo.  The Reverend confides in the powerful white man that ""My greatest sorrow is also your greatest sorrow"".  The performances by these two great actors in this powerful scene would be reason alone to watch this film, but I would still recommend the movie with that centerpiece scene removed.It is clich&eacute;d to say that the world would be a better place if we were collectively more understanding and tolerant of those who were different from us, but ""Cry the Beloved Country"" brings this sentiment forward in a way that is realistic and powerful.",5,James Earl Jones Shines in Noble Performance,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2665,"['Darrell', 'Roodt', 'chose', 'carefully', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'direct', 'first', 'film', 'South', 'Africa', 'abolition', 'Apartheid', 'Alan', 'Paton', 'novel', 'was', 'first', 'filmed', '1951', 'Cry', 'Beloved', 'Country', 'tale', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'South', 'African', 'collective', 'zeitgeist', 'Twain', 'Hemingway', 'Steinbeck', 'part', ""America's.This"", 'film', 'version', 'centered', 'perhaps', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'most', 'powerful', 'screen', 'performance', 'Reverend', 'Stephen', 'Kumalo', 'clergyman', 'small', 'town', 'South', 'Africa', 'strong', 'man', 'faith', 'congregation', 'matters', 'religious', 'practical', 'son', 'ran', 'away', 'Johannesburg', 'work', 'mines', 'sister', 'went', 'away', 'also', 'join', 'husband', 'brother', 'John', 'also', 'city', 'outspoken', 'black', 'activist', 'who', 'abandoned', 'ways', 'religion', 'religion', 'not', 'creating', 'justice', 'blacks', 'film', 'Reverend', 'Kumalo', 'receiving', 'word', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'well', 'Johannesburg.Richard', 'Harris', 'role', 'James', 'Jarvis', 'wealthy', 'white', 'landowner', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'son', 'also', 'gone', 'Johannesburg', 'where', 'activist', 'trying', 'improve', 'repressed', 'condition', 'South', 'African', 'Blacks', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'starting', 'come', 'evil', 'thumb', 'Apartheid.The', 'whites', 'blacks', 'are', 'so', 'separate', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'prominent', 'figures', 'small', 'town', 'Mr.', 'Jarvis', 'Reverend', 'Kumalo', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'met', 'movie', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'more', 'once', 'spoiling', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'reveal', 'two', 'sons', 'two', 'characters.Roodt', 'way', 'display', 'noble', 'suffering', 'Reverend', 'Kumalo', 'never', 'discouraging', 'word', 'even', 'when', 'confronting', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'story', 'hinges', 'Kumalo', 'innate', 'goodness', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'life', 'way', 'story', 'along.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'single', 'scene', 'one', 'Kumalo', 'Jarvis', 'first', 'meet', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'tragedy', 'already', 'occurred', 'men', 'are', 'kind', 'mourning', 'Kumalo', 'Jarvis', 'Jarvis', 'vaguely', 'Kumalo', 'Reverend', 'confides', 'powerful', 'white', 'man', 'greatest', 'sorrow', 'also', 'greatest', 'sorrow', 'performances', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'powerful', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'alone', 'watch', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'centerpiece', 'scene', 'removed.It', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'say', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'were', 'collectively', 'more', 'understanding', 'tolerant', 'who', 'were', 'different', 'Cry', 'Beloved', 'Country', 'sentiment', 'forward', 'way', 'realistic', 'powerful']",Cry the Beloved Country VHS

Moreover the murdered white man had grown up on a wealthy plantation neighboring the black priest's church.  The son of prejudiced white parents, the murdered white man had grown to become an outstanding, well recognized spokesman against apartheid and for equality among the races in South Africa.  When the murdered man's father, ignorant of his son's work, reads it, he embraces the concepts.Ultimately the black priest and the white landowner meet one another, although both had been much aware of the other's existence.  The humble priest must reveal that it was his son who took away the life of the other man's son.  The scene never fails to create streams of tears to flow down my face.This newer version of Alan Paton's novel is touchingly portrayed by two outstanding actors - Richard Harris and James Earl Jones.  Having seen the earlier version of ""Cry, the Beloved Country,"" I thought I would not enjoy this rendition because the first one had been prepared with a modest simplicity which such a movie deserves in order to bring the theme to the forefront.
