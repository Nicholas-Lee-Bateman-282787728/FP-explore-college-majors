1310065,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B002ZG9904,Amanda,"[24, 31]","Dreamworks continues its popular, yet waning Shrek franchise with a fourth installment. I've always been a big fan of the original Shrek. It was something different, quirky, unexpected and just downright witty. The plot was simple yet complex enough to keep me interested while poking fun at traditional fairy tales. It was an innovative and fun concept. Sadly, the franchise continued past the first film into a second and third. Each of these entries were okay, but never captured the greatness of the first Shrek film. With the fourth entry into the series, it becomes even more apparent that the franchise is getting tired. Shrek's running out of steam and just doesn't have it anymore. It's time for our dear ogre friend to retire.Shrek Forever After semi-follows the traditional ""what if I was never born"" plot. When Shrek finds that he misses his days as an ogre, he makes a deal with the notorious Rumpelstiltskin to trade a day in his life for a day to be an ogre again. Rumpelstiltskin, of course, tricks Shrek and takes the day Shrek was born, thereby creating an alternate universe where he rules Far Far Away, ogres are outlaws, and Fiona was never rescued from the tower by Shrek. Shrek soon discovers his mistake and must figure out how to get things back to normal.On one hand it was really fun to see the beloved Shrek characters in the alternate universe -Fiona is the leader of the ogre resistance against Rumpelstiltskin, Donkey works any job he can get, and Puss has become an overweight lap cat. On the other hand, the concept felt tired and much of the plot seemed like a retread of previous ideas, themes and events. Mostly, it seemed redundant to have Shrek win Fiona's love again and really showed that our poor ogre really doesn't have much plot left in him.In general the movie is entertaining, funny and enjoyable -great for families, but the 3-D aspect doesn't really add much. I'd suggest saving the extra money and just going for this movie in traditional 2-D. It was still fun to get another glimpse into the lives of these fun characters and into the wacky world of Far Far Away, but I think it's time to hang up your torches and pitchforks and call it a day.",3,"Fun, but time to let it go",1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,2193,"['Dreamworks', 'popular', 'yet', 'waning', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'fourth', 'installment', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Shrek', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'quirky', 'unexpected', 'just', 'downright', 'witty', 'plot', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'complex', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'poking', 'fun', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tales', 'was', 'innovative', 'fun', 'concept', 'Sadly', 'franchise', 'continued', 'first', 'film', 'second', 'third', 'entries', 'were', 'okay', 'never', 'captured', 'greatness', 'first', 'Shrek', 'film', 'fourth', 'entry', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'franchise', 'getting', 'tired', 'Shrek', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'anymore', 'time', 'dear', 'ogre', 'friend', 'retire.Shrek', 'Forever', 'semi-follows', 'traditional', 'what', 'was', 'never', 'born', 'plot', 'When', 'Shrek', 'days', 'ogre', 'deal', 'notorious', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'trade', 'day', 'life', 'day', 'be', 'ogre', 'again', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'course', 'tricks', 'Shrek', 'day', 'Shrek', 'was', 'born', 'thereby', 'creating', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'rules', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'ogres', 'are', 'outlaws', 'Fiona', 'was', 'never', 'rescued', 'tower', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', 'soon', 'mistake', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'things', 'back', 'normal.On', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'see', 'beloved', 'Shrek', 'characters', 'alternate', 'universe', '-Fiona', 'leader', 'ogre', 'resistance', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'Donkey', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'Puss', 'become', 'overweight', 'lap', 'cat', 'other', 'hand', 'concept', 'felt', 'tired', 'much', 'plot', 'seemed', 'retread', 'previous', 'ideas', 'themes', 'events', 'Mostly', 'seemed', 'redundant', 'have', 'Shrek', 'win', 'Fiona', 'love', 'again', 'really', 'showed', 'poor', 'ogre', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'left', 'him.In', 'general', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'enjoyable', '-great', 'families', '3-D', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'saving', 'extra', 'money', 'just', 'going', 'movie', 'traditional', '2-D', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'get', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'fun', 'characters', 'wacky', 'world', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'think', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'torches', 'pitchforks', 'call', 'day']",Shrek Forever After

Having the same voice cast is not the only thing you need for a good movie, plot and continuity - something the directors of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the first three Shrek Movies and many other sequels - have managed.This movie is boring and predicable, and not particularly funny. As an adult I enjoyed the other three movies - this one was frustrating. NOTHING lined up with the other movies. Shrek didn't exist and that made Far Far Away change forever. Shrek wasn't a huge part of Far Far Away until he rescued Fiona. In the second movie the King knew that Prince Charming would - eventually - rescue Fiona because he had promised it to the Fairy Godmother.The only reason Puss in Boots was associated with Fiona was because of Shrek, the King never would have met Puss if Shrek hadn't married Fiona and stood in the way of Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother. See where I'm going with this? And when Shrek met Fiona she was so caught up in the ""my prince will rescue me"" bit that it's not even plausible that she would have tried to escape. Last but not least, Rumplestiltskin was IN Shrek 3, in one of the Tavern scenes with Prince Charming.I saw this movie in the theatre and I left extremely disappointed. I bought the other three movies individually - there is no way I'd waste my money on this garbage. I'd rather buy the third Aladdin movie from Disney.If you're a devoted Shrek fan because of the humor that adults and kids can enjoy, great plot and a good romance, this isn't the movie for you.

I thought the second was a bit of a slump but then kind of felt that the third was great.  This mess though, I mean...what is going on here?  There is no life in this fourth installment in the rapidly growing tired series.  There is some humor to be had, but this final (PLEASE LET THIS BE OGRE) film is just too dark, too repetitive and too bland for its own good.  I understand trying to spruce things up in certain areas with regards to narrative, but the formula used doesn't change and so shifting the story arcs a tad doesn't really create a new feel to the film.  The opening segment was pretty great, and it felt like the light airy fluff that permeated the first film was going to establish an entertaining treat, but that is soon stripped away to reveal a much darker and more sinister turn of events, which doesn't bode well for a film series that popped so much thanks to the brisk `fairytale' overtones.  The voice work is still very good, and the CGI animation is crisp with some stellar cinematography, but overall this film is a dud and certainly the worst in the series.

1310081,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG9904,Chris Pandolfi,"[33, 40]","""Shrek Forever After"" (if that is its real title) achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve simply by being a fun animated comedy with characters we've come to love. Still, for something so heavily promoted as being the final chapter, I'm surprised at how small and ordinary it seemed. Movies like this should end with a bang, emotionally and physically; they should not go from beginning to end on a slow and steady burn. By the end, most will feel as if they've been entertained. I felt that way. At the same time, some may feel that, in all likelihood, this movie didn't have to be made. I felt that way, too. Perhaps it's no longer a good sign that we can be so easily amused by unnecessary films. Are they no stories left to stimulate our imaginations and broaden our horizons at the same time?In this film, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) finds that he's dissatisfied with his new life as a domestic ogre. As a husband and father, he has absolutely no free time. Villagers no longer fear him. He can't take a mud bath without being invaded by swamp tourists. Knowing he's desperate for a change, the disgruntled Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn) offers Shrek a chance live one day as his old ogre self. The catch, as I understand it, is that one day out of his past will be erased from time - give a day to get a day, according to Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek agrees and signs a contract, although he fails to specify precisely which day he'll let Rumpelstiltskin have. Bad move; he's transported to an alternate Far Far Away that's ruled by Rumpelstiltskin and has fallen into ruin.There are other changes. At Rumpelstiltskin's bidding, ogres are hunted by wicked witches and forced into slavery. Shrek's best friend, Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), now a lowly cart puller, has never met Shrek and is afraid of him. Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) is now an obese housecat and owned by Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), no longer Shrek's beloved wife and mother to his children but rather the iron-clad leader of an underground ogre resistance. Like Donkey, she has no idea who Shrek is. Stranger still, she's back under the curse that factored into the first film. In this new Far Far Away, it's as if Shrek had never been born. If he's to set everything right, he must turn to that most reliable of fairy-tale clich&eacute;s: Receiving true love's kiss before the following sunrise.What are Rumpelstiltskin's motives? I leave it to you to find out. I will say that his reasons are about as good as they can be for a fairy tale. I liked this character; big of ego and short of stature, he's villainous in a childish, sniveling sort of way, making for a great deal of fun when he loses his temper.Many of the previous film's more memorable side characters are used far less frequently in ""Shrek Forever After,"" making for a film that feels oddly condensed. The appearances of Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, and Gingy the Gingerbread Man, for example, are reduced to mere cameos, which is a missed opportunity for some great comedy. I'm especially fond of Gingy, with his iced legs and candy eyes and grating voice. In the alternate Far Far Away, he has become a battle-scarred gladiator who fights for the amusement of cheering crowds; the fact that his opponents are animal crackers and that he uses a broken lollipop as a weapon is, in my warped way of thinking, inherently funny. Maybe it's because foods of such childish innocence have become violent. Or maybe it has something to do Gingy being one tough cookie.It seems that the film's biggest draw, aside from being the last in the series, is its release in 3-D. I've championed certain 3-D films (Disney's ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""Avatar""), but now that it's back in the mainstream, I'm coming to the realization that, generally speaking, it's an overrated marketing gimmick. For this particular film, I suggest you save your cash for a traditional (and less expensive) 2-D experience. I'm quite certain the overall quality will not be affected.The bottom line: The story is funny and exciting and sweet, and I had a pleasant time watching it. But ""Shrek Forever After"" is not the grandiose finale the ads have claimed it to be, and I find that a little disappointing. My recommendation relates not to its worth as a successor to the previous ""Shrek"" films, or even to its status as the last in the series; it relates to the belief that audiences will enjoy it on its own terms. It's a light, good-hearted animated comedy, and as such films go, it gets the job done. I can only hope the filmmakers don't treat it like a horror franchise, some of which are known to produce sequels even after a ""final chapter"" has been released. At that point, I don't think there will anything good left to say about Shrek and his magical misadventures.",4,Is it Finally Done and Ogre with?,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,4838,"['Shrek',

To me, that's the sign of a bad movie.We saw Shrek 4 awhile ago.  The plot reminds me of Back to the Future, set in a fairy tale world.  Shrek is having a mid-life crisis when his married life with Fiona and children seems far too repetitive.  He wishes he would live one day again as an ogre.Enter Rumpelstiltskin.  Upon signing on the dotted line, Shrek is transported to a different world.  At first, he has a lot of fun being, well, an ogre---terrorizing the populace and the likes.  But, eventually, he realizes that, unless he wins Fiona's love at the end of the day (and she doesn't know him), he will cease to exist.However, Rumpelstiltskin isn't about to let THAT happen.  In this brave new world, he is the evil ruler, with an army of pumpkin throwing witches.  And he will do anything to prevent Shrek from winning Fiona's love.At first, it appears he doesn't need much help, since Fiona doesn't know him and only values combat skill, as she is now a warrior (picture an ogre Valkyrie).It is hilarious seeing a pudgy Puss in Boots, and Donkey has some classic funny scenes.  Overall, it is a far better Shrek movie than the third, but not up to the standards of the first or second.It's a lot of fun to watch but not necessarily a must own.",4,Better than Shrek 3,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,1337,"['friends', 'saw', 'Shrek', '3', 'none', 'can', 'remember', 'much', 'anything', 'sign', 'bad', 'movie.We', 'saw', 'Shrek', '4', 'awhile', 'ago', 'plot', 'Back', 'Future', 'set', 'fairy', 'tale', 'world', 'Shrek', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'when', 'married', 'life', 'Fiona', 'children', 'far', 'too', 'repetitive', 'would', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'again', 'ogre.Enter', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'signing', 'dotted', 'line', 'Shrek', 'transported', 'different', 'world', 'first', 'lot', 'fun', 'being', 'well', 'ogre', '-terrorizing', 'populace', 'likes', 'eventually', 'Fiona', 'love', 'end', 'day', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'cease', 'exist.However', 'Rumpelstiltskin', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'THAT', 'happen', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'evil', 'ruler', 'army', 'pumpkin', 'throwing', 'witches', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'prevent', 'Shrek', 'winning', 'Fiona', 'love.At', 'first', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'help', 'Fiona', ""n't"", 'know', 'only', 'values', 'combat', 'skill', 'now', 'warrior', 'picture', 'ogre', 'Valkyrie', '.It', 'hilarious', 'seeing', 'pudgy', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Donkey', 'classic', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Overall', 'far', 'better', 'Shrek', 'movie', 'third', 'not', 'standards', 'first', 'second.It', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'necessarily', 'must', 'own']",Shrek Forever After

1310086,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG9904,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","The original Shrek animated film really seemed to offer a lot of promise for a potential franchise. It was a kids movie that was funny for both kids and adults, was way more clever than expected, and even had mild cursing that was both humorous and relevant. It was an animated film with a solid story that was entertaining for all ages and had that secret ingredient of heart to bring it all together. Unfortunately, the franchise seemed to slide further and further downhill from there. Shrek 2 was slightly amusing, but there weren't many laugh out loud moments. It was disappointing enough to make me skip Shrek the Third altogether. Which brings us to Shrek Forever After, the last Shrek film which serves more as a coup de grce and that final nail in the coffin rather than a satisfying conclusion to what was once a promising franchise.The subtle humor used in the Shrek films has always been the high point for me, but the sequels seemed to use that humor less and less as the franchise went on. There are a few good uses of it in Shrek Forever After like Rumpelstiltskin's goose Fifi slowly ducking out of frame, the Queen locking the door to their carriage once they enter Rumpelstiltskin's sketchy neighborhood, and a fat Puss in Boots slowly sliding down his cat toy. But the sequels tend to be less about that kind of humor that reeled Shrek fans in to begin with and more about being cute or goofy while its execution feels underdeveloped or half-assed in the long run.Shrek Forever After begins shortly before the first film takes place right before Shrek rescues Princess Fiona and meets Donkey. It's a little strange because Shrek Forever After could probably serve as a reboot of sorts since it changes the events of the first film albeit briefly. While the very fabric of the Shrek universe is shaken to its core, it doesn't really feel like finality. Events in the film wrap up in a way that is satisfying, but it tends to feel like just another sequel rather than proper closure.The absolute highlight of the film is the montage of Shrek scaring all of the villagers after he signs the contract with Rumpelstiltskin. It's simple yet funny in its execution. It's probably the best rounded out segment of the film. Gingy tends to be pretty awesome in this one, too.While the film looks its best on Blu-ray, the animation seemed like it was a level down in comparison to films like How to Train Your Dragon and Despicable Me. It's like Shrek animation isn't as smooth or fluid or something. Facial expressions do tend to shine in Shrek films though. Those are usually better and say more than half of the things that come out of the character's mouths these days. Donkey's hair was really detailed, as well. All of its matted and tangled glory takes a front seat on Blu-ray.Shrek Forever After does have glimpses of hilarity and solidarity, but mostly comes off as halfhearted. The sequels could never really put together the same formula that made the first film so entertaining. Although mildly cute, slightly entertaining, and rather profitable, Shrek Forever After will more than likely help you understand why the franchise ended rather than reminisce about Shrek's previous adventures.",2,Falls flat and feels halfhearted,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,3209,"['original', 'Shrek', 'animated', 'film', 'really', 'seemed', 'offer', 'lot', 'promise', 'potential', 'franchise', 'was', 'kids', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'kids', 'adults', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'clever', 'expected', 'even', 'had', 'mild', 'cursing', 'was', 'humorous', 'relevant', 'was', 'animated', 'film', 'solid', 'story', 'was', 'entertaining', 'ages', 'had', 'secret', 'ingredient', 'heart', 'bring', 'together', 'Unfortunately', 'franchise', 'seemed', 'slide', 'further', 'further', 'downhill', 'there', 'Shrek', '2', 'was', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'was', 'disappointing', 'enough', 'make', 'skip', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'altogether', 'Which', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'last', 'Shrek', 'film', 'more', 'coup', 'de', 'grce', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'rather', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'promising', 'franchise.The', 'subtle', 'humor', 'used', 'Shrek', 'films', 'always', 'been', 'high', 'point', 'sequels', 'seemed', 'use', 'humor', 'less', 'less', 'franchise', 'went', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'uses', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'goose', 'Fifi', 'slowly', 'ducking', 'frame', 'Queen', 'locking', 'door', 'carriage', 'enter', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'sketchy', 'neighborhood', 'fat', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'slowly', 'sliding', 'down', 'cat', 'toy', 'sequels', 'tend', 'be', 'less', 'kind', 'humor', 'reeled', 'Shrek', 'fans', 'begin', 'more', 'being', 'cute', 'goofy', 'execution', 'feels', 'underdeveloped', 'half-assed', 'long', 'run.Shrek', 'Forever', 'begins', 'shortly', 'first', 'film', 'place', 'right', 'Shrek', 'rescues', 'Princess', 'Fiona', 'meets', 'Donkey', 'little', 'strange', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'could', 'probably', 'serve', 'reboot', 'sorts', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'albeit', 'briefly', 'very', 'fabric', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'shaken', 'core', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'finality', 'Events', 'film', 'wrap', 'up', 'way', 'satisfying', 'feel', 'just', 'sequel', 'rather', 'proper', 'closure.The', 'absolute', 'highlight', 'film', 'montage', 'Shrek', 'scaring', 'villagers', 'signs', 'contract', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'simple', 'yet', 'funny', 'execution', 'probably', 'best', 'rounded', 'out', 'segment', 'film', 'Gingy', 'be', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'Blu-ray', 'animation', 'seemed', 'was', 'level', 'down', 'comparison', 'films', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Shrek', 'animation', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'fluid', 'something', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'do', 'tend', 'shine', 'Shrek', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'better', 'say', 'more', 'half', 'things', 'come', 'character', 'mouths', 'days', 'Donkey', 'hair', 'was', 'really', 'detailed', 'as', 'well', 'matted', 'tangled', 'glory', 'front', 'seat', 'Blu-ray.Shrek', 'Forever', 'have', 'glimpses', 'hilarity', 'solidarity', 'mostly', 'off', 'halfhearted', 'sequels', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'put', 'together', 'same', 'formula', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'entertaining', 'mildly', 'cute', 'slightly', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'profitable', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'franchise', 'ended', 'rather', 'reminisce', 'Shrek', 'previous', 'adventures']",Shrek Forever After

1310093,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B002ZG9904,Derek,"[0, 0]","This movie was a big surprise for me. I had heard several people say that it was better thanShrek the Third, which was a positive thing to hear since that film was very forgettable. But I was skeptical nonetheless. The commercials had looked quite funny, but then again, so did the previews for Shrek the Third. So I finally watched this one and... it was very good.I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. The creators of the film made some very smart decisions with this film and it made for a very fun and enjoyable watch. I think that this actually might be my favorite Shrek film.In this film, Shrek is feeling overwhelmed by the monotonous duties and demands of fatherhood and celebrity-hood. The conniving Rumpelstiltskin offers Shrek the chance to relive the past and, thinking it a harmless deal, Shrek signs a contract and is flung into an alternate reality where he is once again a feared and horrible ogre.As the Shrek film series has progressed, each film has become more crude and involved more pointless humor than it's predecessor. So, naturally, one would think that this film would be the most crude and most adult of the franchise. But it's not. The filmmakers decided to step away from the crude humor and focus their efforts on the story and the character development. The story plays off the idea of ""You don't know what you have until it's gone"" and we are treated to a very deep and very endearing story. We get to see layers of the characters that we never knew existed and we are actually touched by how charming and sentimental Shrek can actually be. This is very much a love story.I think the creators did an excellent job of bringing the story full circle and ending the franchise with a very inspiring and moving story.

What is really cute about this scene are the small Donkey/Dragon kids that are flying alongside their mother. It has all the makings of a cool high flying family outing.Next there is the action scene where Shrek is riding a witch's broom. He is being chased by a bunch of witches that are hurling bombs at him through various corridors and levels of a vast castle. It reminded me a bit of the final action sequence in the very first Star Wars movie (Episode 4).Finally Shrek and Fiona go into a sort of high flying circus act to tie up the dragon (Donkey's wife in the alter universe).In my opinion all these high flying action sequences make this movie well worth the watch!,4,Nice Aerial Action Scenes,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,859,"['4th', 'installment', 'Shrek', 'very', 'unique', 'very', 'impressive', 'Aerial', 'Action', 'sequences.Firstly', 'Shrek', 'Family', 'riding', 'along', 'Donkey', 'family', 'What', 'really', 'cute', 'scene', 'are', 'small', 'Donkey/Dragon', 'kids', 'are', 'flying', 'mother', 'makings', 'cool', 'high', 'flying', 'family', 'action', 'scene', 'where', 'Shrek', 'riding', 'witch', 'broom', 'being', 'chased', 'bunch', 'witches', 'are', 'hurling', 'bombs', 'various', 'corridors', 'levels', 'vast', 'castle', 'reminded', 'bit', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'very', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'Episode', '4', '.Finally', 'Shrek', 'Fiona', 'go', 'sort', 'high', 'flying', 'circus', 'act', 'tie', 'up', 'dragon', 'Donkey', 'wife', 'alter', 'universe', '.In', 'opinion', 'high', 'flying', 'action', 'sequences', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'watch']",Shrek Forever After

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","SHREK FOREVER AFTER blew up the box office, so I don't know if the filmmakers can stick to their vow of this being the last film in the franchise. But this fourth entry is an improvement over the last one, SHREK THE THIRD. Much as I enjoyed SHREK THE THIRD, it lacked the freshness and wicked punch of the first two Shrek pictures. SHREK FOREVER AFTER resurrects some of that old sparkle.Familial bliss apparently doesn't suit Shrek. Now a domesticated swamp ogre, he feels down in the dumps. A loving wife to wake up to, three adorable triplets to spoil - these kids being ogres, the ""adorable"" bit may be subjective - and his fairy tale pals to hang out with. And yet Shrek misses the good old days, back when he used to terrorize the villagers and those villagers used to chase him with pitchforks and torches. On his children's first birthday bash, he's treated like a tame monster, like a party trick, one brat prodding him over and over to ""Do the roar."" This is altogether improper behavior accorded towards a proper ogre. And so Shrek finally loses it.Tearing out of the birthday party, Shrek stumbles onto Rumpelstiltskin rooting around in the trash. Rumpelstiltskin, that little man whose specialty is magical transactions, has seen better days. He had a shot once upon a time to rule the kingdom of Far Far Away, coming this close to having Princess Fiona's royal parents sign away the kingdom to him... that is, until Shrek came along and rescued Fiona from her tower. Today Rumpelstiltskin eyes Shrek and seizes opportunity. Shrek yearns for just one day in which he still had his bad ogre mojo, 24 hours in which he can have his old life back. Rumpelstiltskin offers him this one day, in exchange for one day from Shrek's past. Shrek signs the contract, doesn't read the fine print. Silly ogre.Shrek gets his wish, finds that folks are once again terrified of him. And then it dawns on him, horrifyingly, that he's now in an alternate reality. One in which Rumpelstiltskin governs Far Far Away as a police state, with covens of hag witches serving as his minions. That day from Shrek's past that Rumpelstiltskin took? It's the day Shrek was born. And so everything that Shrek had ever done has become undone. And after his 24 hours are spent, Shrek is doomed to fade away from existence. His only hope is the escape clause which hinges on Shrek's planting true love's kiss on someone.I love me some alternate reality stories, and I think SHREK FOREVER AFTER shines in exploiting this premise. There are some wonderful sight gags. Lots of fun in seeing how familiar characters are re-imagined in this darker reality. It's pretty funny, what's happened to Gingy (the Gingerbread Man) and Puss in Boots. In an interesting twist, Shrek, the grumpy ogre, now finds himself having to befriend Donkey and Puss n Boots all over again. But his biggest challenge is in romancing Princess Fiona, now become a rebel warrior. She doesn't think much of Shrek.This movie has its darker elements, and the modern fractured fairy tale aesthetics are still around. By now these familiar voice actors can do this in their sleep, and there's a sense of comfort in listening to them do their thing (I think Mike Meyers is now known more for playing Shrek than for starring in the WAYNE'S WORLD films). We get two new and noteworthy characters. Rumpelstiltskin makes a terrific villain, vain and insecure and suffering from little man complex. The Pied Piper never does say a word, but he's a memorable gent, anyway. Ultimately, SHREK FOREVER AFTER re-energizes the franchise, mostly because it presents a different perspective.

Great for all age ranges, this enchanting story applies the theory of be careful what you wish for, and enjoy what life has given you , in the fullest.Our tale, as it begins, is Shrek and Fiona savoring the glory of their wedded bliss.  Their trio of tykes are adorable, following in their father's footsteps and inciting numerous giggles among the younger audience.  Shrek, though, is unhappy. He begins to suffer from that quintessential male dilemma that he has lost himself in his wedded life, the frightening ogre now reduced to nothing more than a daddy and an overall lovable monster.Even in this cartoon world, there is always someone who harbors ill will to our green hero.  Rumplestilken makes an interesting foe, intent on granting one's hearts desire  for a simple little payment that is hidden in the fine print of his contracts.  Shrek, downhearted as he is about his lost past, falls prey to the miniature devil in disguise.  What happens next, in Shrek's newly obtained world, is a surprise for everyone.

1310116,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002ZG9904,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[52, 60]","In the fourth and last installment of the Shrek franchise, Shrek (Mike Myers) finds himself becoming tired of his ""domesticated"" life when the routines of married life and fatherhood meet with the constant bombardment of fame and somewhat annoying friends. After storming out of his son's first birthday party Shrek runs into Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who learns of Shrek's desires to be the ogre he once was and offers him a magical contract that would allow him to be an true ogre for a day, in exchange for one thing. In that exchange, though, Shrek gets much more than he bargained for.When the first Shrek came out it was a brilliant anti-fairy tale fairy tale. Openly lampooning Disney movies and theme parks, Shrek was a fresh take on the animated fairy tale where the main characters didn't live happily ever after as picture perfect prince and princess, but as ogres, typically the scourge of any fairy tale. Since then two other Shrek movies have come out, and rather than embracing the counter culture of the first film, the franchise bought into it's own hype and into pop culture and lost the spirit of the original. While not bad films, they were unnecessary and even sapped some of the brilliance of the original. Now with the finale of Shrek in theaters, how does it stand up?More-so than it's predecessors Shrek Forever After tries to come back home to more of the feeling of the first film. Even the plot of the film of Shrek's desire to go back to being a lone ogre on the outskirts of society seems to echo what the filmmakers were desiring to accomplish in picking a premise that allowed them to nearly replicate some of the situations of the first movie. That's one of the strengths of the film is that you get to re-meet the characters in a new fashion and in slightly new characterizations than previous which amps up the fun of this film compared to the previous films.Reaching into an alternate universe has allowed the writers, and the actors, to revision the characters adding to the freshness of this installment in the series. Fiona is now a warrior, leading an ogre rebellion against the king. Donkey, while still the over talkative, funny if slightly annoying sidekick he's a little more wary and a bit brighter than he was in Shrek's real world. Puss has let himself go, and won't even chase a mouse that's sharing his milk. The real surprise here is Walt Dohrn, a writer/storyboard artist who makes his vocal film debut as the voice of the film's baddie, Rumplestiltskin. Everyone does a great job with their vocal work, but Walt and his character steal the show.But for all the good, you can't go home, and Shrek doesn't quite go home either. Compared to the first film this one feels a little tame, sterile. First off, the premise makes this almost seem like a remake of the first film, causing it to loose some of it's freshness. On top of that there's a moral that really stands out, which is something I don't recall being aware of while watching the first three Shrek films, even though it was there.All in all, I would highly recommend this film. Easily it's the second best of the four Shrek films. Each of the three sequels were unnecessary, but this was definitely a higher note to go out on than the last two films. If they had to go through sequels, I'm not sure they could have asked for a better film to go out on. If you've watched the last couple of Shrek films and found yourself to be disappointed give this a try, it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first film but it gets closer than the other sequels.3.5/5",3,Shrek Forever After,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,3571,"['fourth', 'last', 'installment', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'Shrek', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'becoming', 'tired', 'domesticated', 'life', 'when', 'routines', 'married', 'life', 'fatherhood', 'meet', 'constant', 'bombardment', 'fame', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'friends', 'storming', 'son', 'first', 'birthday', 'party', 'Shrek', 'Rumplestiltskin', 'Walt', 'Dohrn', 'who', 'Shrek', 'desires', 'be', 'ogre', 'once', 'was', 'magical', 'contract', 'would', 'allow', 'be', 'true', 'ogre', 'day', 'exchange', 'one', 'thing', 'exchange', 'though', 'Shrek', 'much', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.When', 'first', 'Shrek', 'came', 'was', 'brilliant', 'anti-fairy', 'tale', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Openly', 'lampooning', 'Disney', 'movies', 'theme', 'parks', 'Shrek', 'was', 'fresh', 'take', 'animated', 'fairy', 'tale', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'picture', 'perfect', 'prince', 'princess', 'ogres', 'typically', 'scourge', 'fairy', 'tale', 'then', 'two', 'other', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'rather', 'embracing', 'counter', 'culture', 'first', 'film', 'franchise', 'bought', 'own', 'hype', 'pop', 'culture', 'lost', 'spirit', 'original', 'not', 'bad', 'films', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'even', 'sapped', 'brilliance', 'original', 'Now', 'finale', 'Shrek', 'theaters', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'More-so', 'predecessors', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'tries', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'more', 'feeling', 'first', 'film', 'Even', 'plot', 'film', 'Shrek', 'desire', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'lone', 'ogre', 'outskirts', 'society', 'echo', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'desiring', 'accomplish', 'picking', 'premise', 'allowed', 'nearly', 'replicate', 'situations', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'get', 're-meet', 'characters', 'new', 'fashion', 'slightly', 'new', 'characterizations', 'previous', 'up', 'fun', 'film', 'compared', 'previous', 'films.Reaching', 'alternate', 'universe', 'allowed', 'writers', 'actors', 'revision', 'characters', 'adding', 'freshness', 'installment', 'series', 'Fiona', 'now', 'warrior', 'leading', 'ogre', 'rebellion', 'king', 'Donkey', 'still', 'over', 'talkative', 'funny', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'sidekick', 'little', 'more', 'wary', 'bit', 'brighter', 'was', 'Shrek', 'real', 'world', 'Puss', 'let', 'go', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'chase', 'mouse', 'sharing', 'milk', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'Walt', 'Dohrn', 'writer/storyboard', 'artist', 'who', 'vocal', 'film', 'debut', 'voice', 'film', 'baddie', 'Rumplestiltskin', 'Everyone', 'great', 'job', 'vocal', 'work', 'Walt', 'character', 'steal', 'show.But', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'Shrek', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'home', 'either', 'Compared', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'little', 'tame', 'sterile', 'First', 'premise', 'almost', 'seem', 'remake', 'first', 'film', 'causing', 'loose', 'freshness', 'top', 'moral', 'really', 'out', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'being', 'aware', 'watching', 'first', 'three', 'Shrek', 'films', 'even', 'was', 'there.All', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Easily', 'second', 'best', 'four', 'Shrek', 'films', 'three', 'sequels', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'definitely', 'higher', 'note', 'go', 'out', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'go', 'sequels', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'film', 'go', 'out', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'last', 'couple', 'Shrek', 'films', 'found', 'be', 'disappointed', 'give', 'try', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'magic', 'first', 'film', 'closer', 'other', 'sequels.3.5/5']",Shrek Forever After

1310119,A367NRRUGVD824,B002ZG9904,Jeffrey Michael Kent,"[0, 2]","I really have mixed feelings about this one. Typically when any successful trilogy spews out a 4th film, it's a disaster. It's a simple case of ""We're not done making money off this franchise yet..."" and they end up shooting themselves in the foot. But with Shrek I felt the third installment was the terrible one, and although ""Forever After"" was better, it was still just okay.Shrek's story was told in the first movie... then it was retold in the second movie, just in a different environment with some fun new characters (I enjoyed it)... the third movie was overkill, tired, and not very memorable. When I heard they were making a fourth, I cringed.In this installment Shrek has become bored with his life and gets tricked into an alternate universe which would be their world had he never existed.Ugh! Back to mixed feelings! In my opinion, the ""alternate reality"" angle is cheating. It's been done! It's an easy way to make more money off of a preexisting story. Continuity rules are pretty easy to follow, and there is little challenge to plotting out the story when you give yourself a clean slate to work with. On the other hand, this story was clever, and entertaining enough to bookend the mostly redundant 2nd and 3rd movies.If you already have the first three Shreks, then by all means, get this one and complete the set. If you are not a fan, or have not seen the other three, then don't bother. This one won't even make sense.

1310123,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B002ZG9904,J. Munyon,"[3, 6]","Headliners for Shrek 4, ""Shrek Forever After,"" are Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas; with cameo level work from Julie Andrews and John Cleese.Kudos for continuation of the original cast through all 4 Shrek movies.""Shrek Forever After"" is not as striking and not as captivating as the first three Shrek movies.  It is tough to make that many movies with the same characters and the same people, yet keep it fresh and alive.  But there are some nice elements introduced, such as the ogre underground, the witch horde, and Rumpelstiltskin of course.  I was surprised though that there wasn't an outcry from liberals, diversity, or ethnicity rights groups.  You might say lighten up - this is just a cartoon.  You must not have seen the media frenzy over 2009's ""The Princess And The Frog.""  In today's world there is no end to how some people believe we want to know their opinion and bias on everything, and how the world owes them some kind of apology.Which takes us right into the impetus of ""Shrek Forever After,"" a time in Shrek's life when he's tired of the adult responsibility of coping with everybody and everything around him; whether or not he feels like it.  The little kid's name is Butterpants, who keeps taunting Shrek to, ""Do the roar!""What ensues is Shrek getting his wish and everything and everybody changes.  A little bit along the theme of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (with James Stuart), this latest Shrek movie lets Shrek find out how much of a difference he makes in the lives of his inner circle of friends and family.  At least in ""Shrek Forever After,"" the characters don't remind each other constantly about how different they are from each other, yet demand acceptance regardless of whether or not each friend is trying to contribute equitably.  It is instead a camaraderie romp of solidarity and unity bearing out what team work can accomplish if everybody carries out their respective roles of opportunity and service.The social demographics of this piece however, are bent.  The first three Shrek movies didn't scream it as loudly my direction, and for the most part were entertainment as the movie's primary purpose.  This time Shrek 4 almost comes across as politically correct rhetoric, admonishing the viewing audience to tolerate others without boundaries or personal space imposed by us as individuals in some reasonable balance.  We see greed, irresponsibility, immaturity, contrasting personalities, and self-inflated egos all but out of control; yet Shrek is made to feel bad when those things give him a sense of imbalance and he wants to speak out against the compromise being predominantly his own, and very little give and take occurring back his direction.  Shrek 4 teaches us to conduct ourselves humbly and keep our place, knowing that poor, uneducated, and underpaid working class people living in neighborhoods lacking security should be grateful for what little we do have and remember we could lose even what little we have if we aren't careful to just shut up and take it.I would rather have seen a movie where Shrek and Fiona have a lucky break or are generously offered opportunity to better themselves and enjoy a higher lifestyle at the end of the day - and all their friends get to upgrade alongside them, too.Ultimately though, I'm going to have to admit I like the dragon that donkey is married to, Fiona has some nice choreography and exploitation of the female aspects of Fiona are well done, and Shrek's character wasn't necessarily compromised.  I was glad too about how Puss in Boots wasn't totally helpless just because he has middle-age spread from retirement life.  Donkey and Puss in Boots have a verbal exchange that is good, but a bit too short.  Some of the animation is interestingly life-like for the coven of witches, and Pinocchio continues to be an obvious favorite.  The gingerbread man sequences fighting like a gladiator with animal crackers was pretty well done, and the concept of the Pied Piper was interesting (you can't tell me there isn't a trainload of psychological implication going on there).There are many celebrities with bit part voice roles; Larry King, Regis Philbin, Ryan Seacrest, Kathy Griffin, and others you may recognize, other than the more popularly recognized headliner main characters.I'm going to say I recommend this film with 4 stars as far as being worth seeing, but worth 5 stars as far as owning - to complete your set of all 4 Shrek series movies.  The first three films were geared more to connoisseurs of fairy tale lore and the realm of make believe as references in jokes and puns.  This 4th Shrek movie seems to focus more upon purpose, not so much upon nostalgic humor.  DreamWorks still spent $165 million to produce ""Shrek Forever After,"" and before it was released to DVD format, this 4th Shrek film has grossed over $737 million.I like ""Shrek Forever After"" more than several others in the theaters this year, whether or not DreamWorks was involved.  Shrek is going to be a leader in animation for many years to come, whether or not in the fairy tale genre.",5,"Worthy film; easily relevant theme, but I agree this needs to be the final

My kids (13 1/2 and 5 1/2) both loved this movie, as did my husband and I.SHREK FOREVER AFTER is based losely on the story from ""It's A Wonderful Life.""  Here, we find that our favorite ogre is confused by his new role in the kingdom.  He used to live a solitary life, scaring people and doing whatever he felt like doing; now he has a family, responsibilities, and is viewed as a folk hero.  In a fit of frustration, Shrek wishes that he could be a regular ogre and live his former life, just for a day.  Rumplestiltskin overhears his wish and tricks Shrek into trading his ""ogre day"" for the day he was born.  Shrek finds that he never rescued Fiona, he never had a family, never met his friends, and that he will diappear at the end of his ogre day.  But there is a way out of his contract with Rumplestiltskin.  Can true love still conquer all and save the day?SHREK FOREVER AFTER is cute, fun, and charming family entertainment.  The animation is beautiful, vibrant, and vivid, the story is engaging, and all our favorite voice actors are back.

1310142,A22R1X2P28BFCV,B002ZG9904,Mark K. Rempel,"[0, 0]","The 4th Shrek. The idea has worn thin. So they rebooted to see what would have happened if Shrek had never been born. They have Rumpelstilskin reimaged from the 2nd Shrek (completely different looking) and he has a life as con artist specializing in convoluted contracts with magic. Shrek doesn't like the constant rowdiness of his kids, of parties, of tourists, of taking care of kids. He wants to be alone. Don't we all! So, he wishes to feared again--exchange a day for another day -- namely the day he was born for a day he can scare people. But Fiona waits in vain for Prince Charming. Her parents sign themselves out of existence with a contract with Rumpelstilskin and years more pass. Fiona breaks out of the castle herslf and joins a band of rogue ogres, where she learns some very impressive fighting skills (perhaps copying Xena: Warrior Princess here?), For awhile Shrek enjoys himself, but somehow manages to get captured by witches who work for Rumpelstilskin, who is now emperor.Meanwhile, Fiona is still cursed. Human by day, ogre by night (an idea used in Gargoyles TV series for the character Demona) -- and somehow she manages to hide that fact from the other ogres. It strikes me as an old tired werewolf motif. Fiona is bitter at her lost childhood, and is obsessed with revolution and fighting (again sounds like Demona). Shrek realizes he made a mistake and wants to undo the spell put on him. He must kiss Fiona, but she doesn't love him. She has to love him back in order for it to work. True love's kiss--one of the oldest and most tiresome cliches out of fairy tales. So, first he has to woo her all over again and make her fall in love with him. Ah, conditions, conditions!So, with more twists to the plot than necessary, with false starts, and at first the kiss doesn't work. He finally, after allowing himself to be captured in order to free the other ogres, he discovers (1) Fiona is only part ogre, so was not released (2)by showing his fighting skills he impresses Fiona and soon she does fall for him. (Kill the enemy to impress the girl, how barbaric). First, he has to release her, and his friends crash right back into the castle. Big fight, but he runs out of time -- and at the last second Fiona lovingly kisses him as he is fading away--then she realizes she is still an ogre when the sun comes up. AAAugh!!!. Then that alternative reality dissolves and all are no more.Then Shrek is back at the birthday and he realizes he has to enjoy this constant togetherness. Aauggghhh!! or he will lose Fiona and his kids and his friends. Yet he deserves some time for himself when all are asleep. A conservative pro-family theme.While a good film, it is not a great film. I understand the writers tried to do something new with the fairy tale plot, but it still has a lack of originality. The Devil's Contact is a tired worn out motif. The what would happen if someone was never born has been done too many times. The someone is one thing in day time, a monster (of some kind) at night is as old as fairy tales. I remember a very similar plot in Norwegian Folk Tales, by Asbjornsen and Moe, which I read more than 40 years ago.What I liked was Fiona as a warrior princess--ripping off Xena. She wore her hair loose, wore a tartan and had lots of weapons, and necklace made of fangs. (Certainly more impressive than Merida of &#34;Brave&#34;). Also, I liked that the she-dragon had more to do than in the previous films. The family goes dragonriding (ripping off Anne McCaffrey's DragonRider novels). The dragon attacks the castle. The dragon falls in love with Donkey at the same time Fiona falls in love with Shrek. Give the dragon her own movie.The villain Rumpelstilskin is smarmy, childish, overly emotional and one-dimensional. A disappointing villain. Prefer the Rumpelstilskin of Once Upon a Time TV series. Harold and his Queen barely appear at all. They had one sequence where they go to Rumpelstilskin to get help and have all of their problems go away. They are then erased from that dimension. I wish there were more about the witches. They looked very interesting to me. Iliked them. Especially I like their costumes and their long black gloves.As usual way too many songs. Stop singing and get on with the story. But they also made fun of the previous Shrek films by having a Pied Piper as a bounty hunter and he makes all the ogres dance. Horrors! They get captured.  Dancing ogres! Lots of them. Funny sequence.Each of the Shrek films is about Shrek learning better--but he learns the same lesson each time: not to be selfish and learn to love others.",3,Thin idea old and worn,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,4598,"['4th', 'Shrek', 'idea', 'worn', 'thin', 'rebooted', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Shrek', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'have', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'reimaged', '2nd', 'Shrek', 'completely', 'different', 'looking', 'life', 'con', 'artist', 'specializing', 'convoluted', 'contracts', 'magic', 'Shrek', ""n't"", 'like', 'constant', 'rowdiness', 'kids', 'parties', 'tourists', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'be', 'alone', 'Do', ""n't"", 'So', 'feared', 'again', 'exchange', 'day', 'day', 'namely', 'day', 'was', 'born', 'day', 'can', 'scare', 'people', 'Fiona', 'waits', 'vain', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'parents', 'sign', 'existence', 'contract', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'years', 'more', 'pass', 'Fiona', 'castle', 'herslf', 'band', 'rogue', 'ogres', 'where', 'very', 'impressive', 'fighting', 'skills', 'perhaps', 'copying', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'here', 'awhile', 'Shrek', 'somehow', 'get', 'captured', 'witches', 'who', 'work', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'who', 'now', 'emperor.Meanwhile', 'Fiona', 'still', 'cursed', 'Human', 'day', 'ogre', 'night', 'idea', 'used', 'Gargoyles', 'TV', 'series', 'character', 'Demona', 'somehow', 'hide', 'fact', 'other', 'ogres', 'old', 'tired', 'werewolf', 'motif', 'Fiona', 'bitter', 'lost', 'childhood', 'obsessed', 'revolution', 'fighting', 'again', 'Demona', 'Shrek', 'made', 'mistake', 'undo', 'spell', 'put', 'must', 'kiss', 'Fiona', ""n't"", 'love', 'love', 'back', 'order', 'work', 'True', 'love', 'kiss', 'one', 'oldest', 'most', 'tiresome', 'cliches', 'fairy', 'tales', 'So', 'first', 'woo', 'over', 'again', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'Ah', 'conditions', 'conditions', 'So', 'more', 'twists', 'plot', 'necessary', 'false', 'starts', 'first', 'kiss', ""n't"", 'work', 'finally', 'allowing', 'be', 'captured', 'order', 'free', 'other', 'ogres', '1', 'Fiona', 'only', 'part', 'ogre', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'released', '2', 'showing', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Fiona', 'soon', 'fall', 'Kill', 'enemy', 'impress', 'girl', 'how', 'barbaric', 'First', 'release', 'friends', 'crash', 'right', 'back', 'castle', 'Big', 'fight', 'time', 'last', 'second', 'Fiona', 'lovingly', 'fading', 'away', 'then', 'still', 'ogre', 'when', 'sun', 'up', 'Then', 'alternative', 'reality', 'dissolves', 'are', 'more.Then', 'Shrek', 'back', 'birthday', 'enjoy', 'constant', 'togetherness', 'Aauggghhh', 'will', 'lose', 'Fiona', 'kids', 'friends', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'asleep', 'conservative', 'pro-family', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'understand', 'writers', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'fairy', 'tale', 'plot', 'still', 'lack', 'originality', 'Devil', 'Contact', 'tired', 'worn', 'motif', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'someone', 'was', 'never', 'born', 'been', 'done', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'someone', 'one', 'thing', 'day', 'time', 'monster', 'kind', 'night', 'as', 'old', 'fairy', 'tales', 'remember', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'Norwegian', 'Folk', 'Tales', 'Asbjornsen', 'Moe', 'read', 'more', '40', 'years', 'ago.What', 'liked', 'was', 'Fiona', 'warrior', 'princess', 'ripping', 'off', 'Xena', 'wore', 'hair', 'loose', 'wore', 'tartan', 'had', 'lots', 'weapons', 'necklace', 'made', 'fangs', 'Certainly', 'more', 'impressive', 'Merida', '34', 'Brave', '34', 'Also', 'liked', 'she-dragon', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'previous', 'films', 'family', 'dragonriding', 'ripping', 'off', 'Anne', 'McCaffrey', 'DragonRider', 'novels', 'dragon', 'castle', 'dragon', 'love', 'Donkey', 'same', 'time', 'Fiona', 'love', 'Shrek', 'Give', 'dragon', 'own', 'movie.The', 'villain', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'smarmy', 'childish', 'overly', 'emotional', 'one-dimensional', 'disappointing', 'villain', 'Prefer', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'Once', 'Time', 'TV', 'series', 'Harold', 'Queen', 'barely', 'appear', 'had', 'one', 'sequence', 'where', 'go', 'Rumpelstilskin', 'get', 'help', 'have', 'problems', 'go', 'away', 'are', 'then', 'erased', 'dimension', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'witches', 'looked', 'very', 'interesting', 'Iliked', 'Especially', 'like', 'costumes', 'long', 'black', 'gloves.As', 'usual', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'Stop', 'singing', 'get', 'story', 'also', 'made', 'fun', 'previous', 'Shrek', 'films', 'having', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'ogres', 'dance', 'Horrors', 'get', 'captured', 'Dancing', 'ogres', 'Lots', 'Funny', 'sequence.Each', 'Shrek', 'films', 'Shrek', 'learning', 'better', 'same', 'lesson', 'time', 'not', 'be', 'selfish', 'learn', 'love', 'others']",Shrek Forever After

1310171,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B002ZG9904,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 2]","In the first ""Shrek"" film, our title character had to accept himself; in 2, he had to accept family; and in 3, he had to accept responsibility. In the closing chapter ""Shrek Forever After"", the lesson is clear cut: You don't know what you've got until it's gone. Shrek (given heart & soul by the great Mike Myers) learns this the hard way when his seemingly idyllic life becomes one long broken record of diaper changes, swamp maintenances, and cutesy dinner table stories. Soon feeling trapped in his own life (and longing for the ""good old days"" as a terrifying ogre), he longs for a way out. Enter the devious Rumpelstiltskin (played with gleeful villainy by Walt Dohrn) who talks Shrek into signing an ""ogre for a day"" contract. Relishing his newfound freedom, it all turns sour: A deceitful character such as Rumpel' cleverly weaves repercussions into the contract, and Shrek's world is quickly turned upside down as Donkey (Eddie Murphy again, hilarious as usual) can't fathom a friendship between ogre & donkey; Puss 'n Boots (the suave voice of Antonio Banderos) is now domesticated and morbidly obese; and his beloved Fiona (the terrific Cameron Diaz) is the unlikely leader of an ogre resistance. Worse, Rumpel' has used loopholes to seize & rule The Land of Far, Far Away. So again, it's up to our unlikely hero Shrek to save the day & restore order to his life.The story borrows a page from ""It's A Wonderful Life"", except completely done over, Shrek style. There's a parade of notable voice talent here (as well as The Pied Piper, who has no lines & warbles on his flute instead). And, of course, the animation is excellent.So is it good? Well, I thought SFA falls somewhere in the middle; it's not quite as good as parts 1 & 2, but certainly better than the hit & miss part 3. The opening bit with Shrek's mundane life repeating itself faster & faster is amusing, and the closing credits--cleverly montaging scenes from the earlier films--is a cute & touching farewell, reminding us where the series has been.Extras include deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and cast & crew interviews.So long, Shrek!

1310173,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG9904,RMurray847,"[11, 15]","SHREK FOREVER AFTER feels like a really good episode of a much loved TV show.  For me, the first SHREK movie was something really new, a pop-culture referring, smart-alecky spin on fairy tales, with delightfully new characters and an animation style we hadn't seen before.  It was genuinely touching at times, but mostly hilarious and eye-popping.  SHREK 2 turned up the hilarity quotient and introduced Puss, one of the finest supporting characters in animation since Sebastian the Crab grace THE LITTLE MERMAID.  With SHREK 3, the series had settled into comfortable familiarity.  I smiled more than I laughed...it was clever, but had no thrill of being NEW anymore.  And in this latest film, it felt extremely familiar...like a TV series.First , it's important to note that an enjoyment of SHREK FOREVER AFTER (hereafter called SHREK 4) pretty much requires having seen the other 3 movies.  There is essentially no exposition.  We see Shrek and his family a few days before the First Birthday party for his three children.  While Shrek is enjoying a life of domestic bliss, he's also feeling a little trapped.  He can't even enjoy a good dip in some hot mud without having to first work on the plumbing in the outhouse.  His kids wake him up too early every morning.  His friend Donkey is constantly dropping by with HIS kids and consuming Shrek's evenings.  And when the day of the party arrives, Shrek realizes that he misses being a bachelor and a feared Ogre.  Now little kids ASK him to do his Ogre-roar and sign autographs...instead of running in fear.  I guess Shrek is having a mid-life crisis.But this being a magical kingdom, when Shrek idly wishes he could have ""just one day"" back during his wilder days...the nasty, spiteful little Rumplestiltskin grants him his wish in a fairly one-side bargain.  Shrek is instantly transported to his past, but finds that things have changed.  Rumple now rules the kingdom, and is served by witches.  The ogres are a hunted species and humans are destitute and living in fear.  And none of Shrek's old friends recognize him.  His beloved Fiona is now a resistance leader among the ogres, and she has little interest in Shrek.  But it turns out, he must win her love again within a day, or this retelling of the past will become permanent, and Shrek will puff out of existence.This is all well and good, and certainly the movie has sufficient laughs.  The pop culture references HAVE been toned down some, which is probably good.  They were leaning towards becoming too much of a good thing in SHREK 3, when a lengthy sequence was devoted to making fun of HARRY POTTER...the in-jokes were becoming the point rather than a side note.  The changes in Donkey and particularly Puss in Boots are fun.  The animation is as good as ever...but there's nothing new either.  It's just a visit with some old, familiar friends having some serious trouble.The voice-over work (Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, etc. etc.) is perfectly fine.  The soundtrack is perfectly in keeping with what we've had from these films before.  (I will say, however, that I suspect this film may be less appealing to the little ones than the others.  My youngest is 17, so I don't have a certainty about this...I just think that this film is more plot-driven than those in the past, and the time-travel stuff might confuse the littlest viewers.)And the movie is in 3D, but never has 3D seemed more pointless.  We're just becoming SO accustomed to the 3D experience now, and there were NO moments of ""oooooh"" popping out of the screen at the audience.  Frankly, I mostly forgot the film WAS in 3D until it was time to take the glasses off and drop them in the recycle bin on the way out.If you've seen the first film, do you remember how joyful the final scene was, when all the characters gathered and sang and partied to a variety of pop/rock hits?  I remember wanting the scene to just keep going on, because I had experienced such a joyful and NEW movie, and didn't want it to end.  SHREK 4 has a similar scene (as did all the other films), and when this one started, I was pretty much ready to head for the exits.

1310176,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG9904,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","As ""Shrek Ever After"" opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis.  Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.In the be-careful-what-you-wish-for/you-don't-know-what-you've-got-till-it's-gone scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day.  We then get a new spin on ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born.  He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz) - the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres - to fall in love with him all over again.Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing ""Shrek the Third"" from 2007, ""Shrek Ever After,"" directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did - which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business.  Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo.  Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate.  In fact the voiceover cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers:  Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","One of the main reasons I loved Shrek movies was because of the humor, but this film was a little more serious. Shrek has the family life he wanted--kids, a loving wife, nice home, wholesome friends, personable personality--and he's not happy. Now he wants to be the Ogre that people run away from, the one that intimidates everything in sight and doesn't have to worry about kids crying at night or birthday cake. He makes a deal with Rumpelstilzchen to have one day without his family and finds himself in a troublesome situation when it lasts for longer than a day. What will Shrek do now?Pros: I loved the Pied Piper. I rewound the dancing scenes so many times that I lost count. Those witches were regular b-girls; they did the uprock and everything. But the Ogres doing that side-hip dance amused me to no end. Plus, Craig Robinson was in this film, and you can't go wrong with Craig Robinson.Cons: I usually look forward to Puss n' Boots, Donkey and Shrek as a team, but Shrek spent so much time complaining and freaking out so it kinda took away from the comedy. Puss n' boots' manipulative and fashionable attitude usually makes him a favorite, but this time around he was not only overweight but kinda boring, too. Donkey was all right, but I didn't laugh at him much, outside of the flutey/booty comment. There were so many rats and mice in this film. I cringed and ducked my head several times because they were even around the Pied Piper's feet.The movie was pretty good, but I do think ""Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)"" was far better.

""Shrek Forever After"" is an engaging film, but not in the same was as the first ""Shrek"" was.In the fourth installment Shrek is a family man, who should be happy and content with his peaceful life with Fiona and the kids. Deep in his mind, however, he longs for the good, old days when he was feared by people as ""ogre,"" living alone in the swamp. That is when scheming Rumpelstiltskin offers him a deal: to let Shrek live like a real ogre for one day. All Shrek has to do is give just one day of his life to Rumpelstiltskin.Of course, there is a catch, which you should see for yourself. The film's tone gets surprisingly serious (the party scene and frustrated Shrek, for example), but thankfully the creators know the film is meant to entertain, not to preach.The idea of Shrek and midlife crisis will not appeal to younger audiences, but the original Shrek made about nine years ago was not exactly a film for kids, either. Anyway, the fourth Shrek offers a lot of action and jokes, and they are certainly entertaining and funny, but the witty and pointed humor, for which the Oscar-winning first ""Shrek"" is recognized, is sadly missing.

1310196,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B002ZG9904,V. Berk,"[8, 11]","Shrek Forever After is the fourth and supposedly final entry in the series of films chronicling the comical adventures of a green ogre by the name of Shrek.  The first film released in 2001 was an instant hit.  In 2004 it was followed by Shrek 2 which was also a delightfully entertaining animated-comedy.  Then in 2007 the series took a misstep with Shrek the Third which was forgettable to say the least.  Now we have Shrek Forever After which, though not as bad as Shrek the Third, still doesn't measure up to the first two entries in the series.There isn't much of a plot to Shrek Forever After.  It follows the basic `It's a Wonderful Life' formula of trying to show how the world would be if Shrek was never born.  To me this doesn't seem like a good idea for a Shrek film because it doesn't expand the story what-so-ever because you know by the end of the film things will go back to normal without any change except for Shrek having a better understanding of who he is.  They could have still provided that message without such a generic plot.  In fact, given the scenario they chose I felt incredibly disappointed that we didn't get to see other characters from the series.  What about Lord Farquaad or the Fairy Godmother?  How does Shrek never existing affect this?  We'll never know because the script is so narrow-minded that it does little to expand on the concept of Shrek never being born.Speaking of villains, Rumpelstiltskin (voice of Walt Dohrn) doesn't really measure up compared to the antagonists of the first two films.  Okay, he's a step up from Prince Charming in Shrek the Third, but that doesn't take much.On the bright side the film still keeps the primary voice-actors.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy both get in some good lines as is expected from the two SNL veterans.  Most of the other members of the cast aren't used enough to leave an impression so I have nothing much to say on them.So: is Shrek Forever After a wreck?  Well, to be honest it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be coming into the theater, but it still is a letdown.  Some lines got a chuckle out of me, but for the most part Shrek Forever After pandered to younger members of the audience and robbed jokes from the previous entries in the franchise.Is it a good note for the Shrek franchise to end on?  No.  If this were a perfect world Shrek would have ended on Shrek 2.  Is this movie good for children?  I'd imagine so.  There's nothing in here that's bad for kids, and it does have its clever moments, just not at the same level of quality as the first two films.7/10 stars.  Worth seeing if you have children but don't expect the same quality as Shrek and Shrek 2.",3,Time to give the big green guy a break,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,2682,"['Shrek', 'Forever', 'fourth', 'supposedly', 'final', 'entry', 'series', 'films', 'chronicling', 'comical', 'adventures', 'green', 'ogre', 'name', 'Shrek', 'first', 'film', 'released', '2001', 'was', 'instant', 'hit', '2004', 'was', 'followed', 'Shrek', '2', 'was', 'also', 'delightfully', 'entertaining', 'animated-comedy', 'Then', '2007', 'series', 'took', 'misstep', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'was', 'forgettable', 'say', 'least', 'Now', 'have', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'still', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'entries', 'series.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'basic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'formula', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'Shrek', 'was', 'never', 'born', ""n't"", 'seem', 'good', 'idea', 'Shrek', 'film', ""n't"", 'expand', 'story', 'what-so-ever', 'know', 'end', 'film', 'things', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'change', 'Shrek', 'having', 'better', 'understanding', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'provided', 'message', 'generic', 'plot', 'fact', 'given', 'scenario', 'chose', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'What', 'Lord', 'Farquaad', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'How', 'Shrek', 'never', 'existing', 'affect', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'script', 'so', 'narrow-minded', 'little', 'expand', 'concept', 'Shrek', 'never', 'being', 'born.Speaking', 'villains', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'voice', 'Walt', 'Dohrn', ""n't"", 'really', 'measure', 'up', 'compared', 'antagonists', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Okay', 'step', 'up', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Shrek', 'Third', ""n't"", 'take', 'much.On', 'bright', 'side', 'film', 'still', 'primary', 'voice-actors', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'get', 'good', 'lines', 'expected', 'two', 'SNL', 'veterans', 'Most', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'enough', 'leave', 'impression', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'much', 'say', 'them.So', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'wreck', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'coming', 'theater', 'still', 'letdown', 'lines', 'got', 'chuckle', 'most', 'part', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'pandered', 'younger', 'members', 'audience', 'robbed', 'jokes', 'previous', 'entries', 'franchise.Is', 'good', 'note', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'end', 'No', 'were', 'perfect', 'world', 'Shrek', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Shrek', '2', 'movie', 'good', 'children', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'so', 'nothing', 'here', 'bad', 'kids', 'have', 'clever', 'moments', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'films.7/10', 'stars', 'seeing', 'have', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'quality', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', '2']",Shrek Forever After

It was MUCH better than the horrendous Shrek the Third, but there was honestly nothing new about the humor and plot line.This time around Shrek finds himself frustrated with the daily madness of life as a father and wants to take a short breather. Knowing how fairy tales go, it's not going to be that simple. He meets up with Rumple (not exactly sure on how to spell his whole name) and signs a contract for a day to be free. Naturally, that turns out to be a bad idea.From there, it's nearly predictable. Shrek has to somehow fall in love with Fiona again to break the contract. It may be an alternate universe that he's in, but it's the same plot and humor.Whatever Rumple's evil plan was I'll never know. First, he hates Shrek, then makes a deal with him (which allows him to take over Fiona's kingdom) and as the movie progresses he plans to kill him? He must've forgotten about the timer that was part of the contract that would make Shrek vanish at the end of the day.Perhaps he didn't want to lose the power over the kingdom. :/I was kind of upset that the other characters were just cameos and this is the last Shrek movie.
