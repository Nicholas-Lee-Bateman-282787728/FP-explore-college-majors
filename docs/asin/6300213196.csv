His impassioned speech on behalf of Kirk is a classic, not to be missed. His observations on books vs. computers is also highly noteworthy.The episode starts with a fair degree of tension inolving Kirk and some old acquaintances and the tension builds to an exciting climax involving some Trek standards: a fist fight while the Enterprise is hopelessly(?) lost in a decaying orbit. It ends a little too abruptly, but this episode remains as one of my favorite.",5,Top Notch Star Trek,988761600,"05 2, 2001",2001,555,"['Elisha', 'Cook', 'nearly', 'episode', 'portrayal', 'Samuel', 'T.', 'Cogley', 'attorney', 'law', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'behalf', 'Kirk', 'classic', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'observations', 'books', 'computers', 'also', 'highly', 'noteworthy.The', 'episode', 'fair', 'degree', 'tension', 'inolving', 'Kirk', 'old', 'acquaintances', 'tension', 'exciting', 'climax', 'involving', 'Trek', 'standards', 'fist', 'fight', 'Enterprise', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'decaying', 'orbit', 'little', 'too', 'abruptly', 'episode', 'one', 'favorite']",N/A

In ""Mudd's Women"" Kirk brings charges against Harry Mudd and assigns Spock to him as a sort of public defender; Spock faces his own court martial in the two-part ""The Menagerie""; and in ""Dagger Of The Mind"" the Enterprise visits a penal colony.  The court martial Spock faced was a makeshift effort that he actually manipulated himself, but in ""Court Martial"" Kirk faces a very real and compulsory hearing to determine his negligence in the death of a crewman, the Enterprise's records officer Lt. Commander Ben Finney.During a vicious ion storm Lt. Finney is assigned to dispatch in a pod and take measurements, a normal procedure aboard the starship.  He fails to exit the pod before Kirk is forced to jettison it, though the captain had given ample warning beforehand.  Complicating things are the fact that Kirk was well acquainted with Finney having gone to the academy together; some years later Kirk placed his classmate on report for failure to perform a critical duty correctly.  Finney grumbled frequently about the incident and also spoke aloud about holding a grudge against Kirk; and while Kirk is confident he did nothing to cause his classmate's death the computer seems to tell a different story, in fact it is making a liar out of the captain!The events that lead to Kirk's court martial are well-plotted; having Finney cast as the former friend feeling betrayed puts a decent twist on the whole matter.  Did Kirk absentmindedly jettison the pod before he should have?  Did he subconsciously dislike Finney in return because he felt spurned by a former close friend and confidante?  These questions become the prosecution's platform and the computer tapes made concurrently with the events during the ion storm seem to make this an open and shut case.  Naturally the Trek creators have no intention of letting our steadfast and resolute captain of the Enterprise be that fallible so they wrote an excellent sequence to include in this episode.After the condemning computer tapes are played at the court martial Spock, who has returned to the Enterprise, goes to the recreation room and engages the ship's computer in several games of chess.  McCoy barges in, sees the Vulcan playing chess and calls him the most cold-blooded person he's ever met - to which Spock says ""Why thank you doctor!""  Of course Spock turns out to have ulterior motives for his unusual pastime while ""the captain's neck is nearly in the noose"", but this is one of the most classic McCoy - Spock confrontations from the original series run and a definite must see.",4,An interesting look at Starfleet justice,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,2661,"['Having', 'already', 'seen', 'need', 'judicial', 'system', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Trek', 'fans', 'get', 'real', 'eyeful', 'here', 'Mudd', 'Women', 'Kirk', 'charges', 'Harry', 'Mudd', 'assigns', 'Spock', 'sort', 'public', 'defender', 'Spock', 'own', 'court', 'martial', 'two-part', 'Menagerie', 'Dagger', 'Mind', 'Enterprise', 'penal', 'colony', 'court', 'martial', 'Spock', 'faced', 'was', 'makeshift', 'effort', 'actually', 'manipulated', 'Court', 'Martial', 'Kirk', 'very', 'real', 'compulsory', 'hearing', 'determine', 'negligence', 'death', 'crewman', 'Enterprise', 'records', 'officer', 'Lt', 'Commander', 'Ben', 'Finney.During', 'vicious', 'ion', 'storm', 'Lt.', 'Finney', 'assigned', 'dispatch', 'pod', 'take', 'measurements', 'normal', 'procedure', 'starship', 'exit', 'pod', 'Kirk', 'forced', 'jettison', 'captain', 'had', 'given', 'ample', 'warning', 'beforehand', 'Complicating', 'things', 'are', 'fact', 'Kirk', 'was', 'well', 'acquainted', 'Finney', 'having', 'gone', 'academy', 'together', 'years', 'later', 'Kirk', 'placed', 'classmate', 'report', 'failure', 'perform', 'critical', 'duty', 'correctly', 'Finney', 'grumbled', 'frequently', 'incident', 'also', 'spoke', 'aloud', 'holding', 'grudge', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'confident', 'did', 'nothing', 'cause', 'classmate', 'death', 'computer', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'fact', 'making', 'liar', 'captain', 'events', 'lead', 'Kirk', 'court', 'martial', 'are', 'well-plotted', 'having', 'Finney', 'cast', 'former', 'friend', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'decent', 'twist', 'whole', 'matter', 'Did', 'Kirk', 'absentmindedly', 'jettison', 'pod', 'should', 'have', 'Did', 'subconsciously', 'Finney', 'return', 'felt', 'spurned', 'former', 'close', 'friend', 'confidante', 'questions', 'become', 'prosecution', 'platform', 'computer', 'tapes', 'made', 'concurrently', 'events', 'ion', 'storm', 'seem', 'make', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'Naturally', 'Trek', 'creators', 'have', 'intention', 'letting', 'steadfast', 'resolute', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'be', 'fallible', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'sequence', 'include', 'episode.After', 'condemning', 'computer', 'tapes', 'are', 'played', 'court', 'martial', 'Spock', 'who', 'returned', 'Enterprise', 'recreation', 'room', 'ship', 'computer', 'several', 'games', 'chess', 'McCoy', 'Vulcan', 'playing', 'chess', 'most', 'cold-blooded', 'person', 'ever', 'met', 'Spock', 'Why', 'thank', 'doctor', 'course', 'Spock', 'out', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'unusual', 'pastime', 'captain', 'neck', 'nearly', 'noose', 'one', 'most', 'classic', 'McCoy', 'Spock', 'confrontations', 'original', 'series', 'run', 'definite', 'must', 'see']",N/A
207730,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213196,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","This is a mildly interesting episode both for its strong points as well as its rather silly mistakes. As for the good: there is a Perry-Mason style mystery whose solution is not immediately obvious. At least one of the courtroom speeches given by Kirk's attorney, Mr. Cogley (Elish Cook Jr.) is genuinely moving. The point of the episode is that even after centuries have passed, some of the old values remain with us. Computers are a boon, but also introduce new possibilities for error and criminality, so we must be careful. For this reason, it is not that unreasonable that Cosley might still used old-fashioned law books.Now for the bad. One of the worst blunders that ever aired in Star Trek is when Kirk talks about a device that increases heartbeat sounds 10,000 times and says the factor is ""one to the fourth power."" Ha ha ha! This is an obvious blooper that somehow didn't get fixed, and I suspect even Shatner himself knows enough math to realize that 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 equals 1. Of course he meant ""TEN to the fourth power."" Shatner got his line wrong, but no starship captain would ever make that mistake.Another defect is that far too much action is described by means of voice-over narration in the resolution to the episode. I don't recall this clumsy writing device in any other show.Finally, it's absurd to think that Starfleet command would ever use a prosecutor who openly admitted that she was an old girlfriend of the defendant (Kirk). This violates every conflict-of-interest code, since you couldn't count on her not to subtlely blow the case. Still, one can almost accept this on the grounds of poetic license. They wanted to throw in a love interest for Kirk, and this was the most economical way to do it.Still, if you can get past all that, there is that great speech. Also watch for the final, humorous scene involving the old girlfriend, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.",4,Perry Mason in Space,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1900,"['mildly', 'interesting', 'episode', 'strong', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'silly', 'mistakes', 'good', 'Perry-Mason', 'style', 'mystery', 'solution', 'not', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'least', 'one', 'courtroom', 'speeches', 'given', 'Kirk', 'attorney', 'Mr.', 'Cogley', 'Elish', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'point', 'episode', 'even', 'centuries', 'have', 'passed', 'old', 'values', 'remain', 'Computers', 'are', 'boon', 'also', 'introduce', 'new', 'possibilities', 'error', 'criminality', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'reason', 'not', 'unreasonable', 'Cosley', 'might', 'still', 'used', 'old-fashioned', 'law', 'books.Now', 'bad', 'One', 'worst', 'blunders', 'ever', 'aired', 'Star', 'Trek', 'when', 'Kirk', 'device', 'heartbeat', '10,000', 'times', 'factor', 'one', 'fourth', 'power', 'Ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'obvious', 'blooper', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'fixed', 'suspect', 'even', 'Shatner', 'enough', 'math', 'realize', '1', 'times', '1', 'times', '1', 'times', '1', 'equals', '1', 'course', 'meant', 'TEN', 'fourth', 'power', 'Shatner', 'got', 'line', 'wrong', 'starship', 'captain', 'would', 'ever', 'make', 'mistake.Another', 'defect', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'described', 'means', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'resolution', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'clumsy', 'writing', 'device', 'other', 'show.Finally', 'absurd', 'think', 'Starfleet', 'command', 'would', 'ever', 'use', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'openly', 'admitted', 'was', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'defendant', 'Kirk', 'conflict-of-interest', 'code', 'could', ""n't"", 'count', 'not', 'subtlely', 'blow', 'case', 'Still', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'accept', 'grounds', 'poetic', 'license', 'wanted', 'throw', 'love', 'interest', 'Kirk', 'was', 'most', 'economical', 'way', 'do', 'it.Still', 'can', 'get', 'great', 'speech', 'Also', 'watch', 'final', 'humorous', 'scene', 'involving', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy']",N/A
207731,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213196,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 1]","This episode does a great deal to flesh out the past of James Kirk, but the major point of social significance in the episode is one that is rarely mentioned. Kirk's longtime shipmate Ben Finney was apparently killed in an ion storm and Kirk has been accused of causing it by prematurely jettisoning the pod that Finney was occupying. Kirk insists that he did everything properly, yet the computer record clearly demonstrates that he pressed the button to jettison the pod before Finney had a chance to escape.Kirk and Finney have a long history of serving together and while on a previous ship Kirk reported an error that Finney made that damaged his career. One of Kirk's old female flames is serving as the prosecutor and Kirk as ably defended by the eccentric attorney, Samuel T. Cogley. Spock refuses to believe that Kirk is guilty so he tests the computer by engaging in a series of chess matches. One of the best scenes of the entire series is when McCoy admonishes Spock for playing chess when Jim is in trouble and Spock responds with a statement that he has been winning.Spock and McCoy realize that Finney tampered with the computer records and is still on the ship so they convince the tribunal to reconvene on the Enterprise. All but a skeleton crew is evacuated and McCoy is able to put their combined heartbeats on audio. At first it is a jumble, but then he selectively removes the heartbeat of each person from the combination. When that is done, one heartbeat remains and they all realize that it is Finney's. He is alive and hiding in engineering.Once Finney realizes that he has been discovered, he sabotages the engines and Kirk must fight and defeat him. He does so and is able to reverse the sabotage. At the end, Kirk is talking to his old girlfriend and he learns that Cogley is defending Ben Finney in his court-martial trial.The most significant point in this episode is the character Commodore Stone, Kirk's superior officer and the man running the trial. He is played by a black man, which was most unusual at that point in time. Gene Roddenberry and the producers of Star Trek were in many ways very much ahead of their time, and that is no more evident than the fact that they would put a black man in a position of such power and importance.",5,Exciting and contains a main point of social significance that is often overlooked,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,2273,"['episode', 'great', 'deal', 'flesh', 'out', 'past', 'James', 'Kirk', 'major', 'point', 'social', 'significance', 'episode', 'one', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'Kirk', 'longtime', 'shipmate', 'Ben', 'Finney', 'was', 'apparently', 'killed', 'ion', 'storm', 'Kirk', 'been', 'accused', 'causing', 'prematurely', 'jettisoning', 'pod', 'Finney', 'was', 'occupying', 'Kirk', 'did', 'everything', 'properly', 'yet', 'computer', 'record', 'clearly', 'pressed', 'button', 'jettison', 'pod', 'Finney', 'had', 'chance', 'escape.Kirk', 'Finney', 'have', 'long', 'history', 'serving', 'together', 'previous', 'ship', 'Kirk', 'reported', 'error', 'Finney', 'made', 'damaged', 'career', 'One', 'Kirk', 'old', 'female', 'flames', 'serving', 'prosecutor', 'Kirk', 'ably', 'defended', 'eccentric', 'attorney', 'Samuel', 'T.', 'Cogley', 'Spock', 'believe', 'Kirk', 'guilty', 'computer', 'engaging', 'series', 'chess', 'matches', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'entire', 'series', 'when', 'McCoy', 'Spock', 'playing', 'chess', 'when', 'Jim', 'trouble', 'Spock', 'statement', 'been', 'winning.Spock', 'McCoy', 'realize', 'Finney', 'tampered', 'computer', 'records', 'still', 'ship', 'convince', 'tribunal', 'reconvene', 'Enterprise', 'skeleton', 'crew', 'evacuated', 'McCoy', 'able', 'put', 'combined', 'heartbeats', 'audio', 'first', 'jumble', 'then', 'selectively', 'heartbeat', 'person', 'combination', 'When', 'done', 'one', 'heartbeat', 'realize', 'Finney', 'alive', 'hiding', 'engineering.Once', 'Finney', 'been', 'discovered', 'engines', 'Kirk', 'must', 'fight', 'defeat', 'so', 'able', 'reverse', 'sabotage', 'end', 'Kirk', 'talking', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Cogley', 'defending', 'Ben', 'Finney', 'court-martial', 'trial.The', 'most', 'significant', 'point', 'episode', 'character', 'Commodore', 'Stone', 'Kirk', 'superior', 'officer', 'man', 'running', 'trial', 'played', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'most', 'unusual', 'point', 'time', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'producers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'were', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'much', 'ahead', 'time', 'more', 'evident', 'fact', 'would', 'put', 'black', 'man', 'position', 'such', 'power', 'importance']",N/A
