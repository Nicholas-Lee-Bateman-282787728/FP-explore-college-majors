This movie is absolutely awesome. This  is what introduced me to Tenchi Muyo. When I first saw it, I saw only the  second half, and I spent months looking for it to come on again. I finally  saw the whole thing by renting it and it was definately worth it. For those  of you who don't know anything about Tenchi Muyo it's a great introduction,  and for those of you who know it and love it, it's probably the best Tenchi  Muyo has ever been. I highly recommend it. For those of you who know the  difference between the Tenchi OVA and Tenchi Universe, it seems to follow  the Tenchi Universe storyline. This movie is Tenchi Muyo at its best. If  you haven't seen this movie yet, get it right now. You don't know what your  missing.(P.S. Tenchi Muyo is currently showing on Cartoon Network at 6  P.M. on weekdays.

With its incredible animation, Direction and script. It makes it a must for any tenchi fan.From what I can see there are two kinds of tenchi fans.  The ones who watch tenchi muyo For the pure feeling of love and friendship.. And the ones who love the action and character devolpment not to mention the characters. This has a little for everyone. Not to mention Incredibly well directed.

The storyline and animation is superb and you will absolutely love the antics of constant rivals Ryoko and Aeka. The story starts off in a typical day at the Masaki house. They are watching old movie clips of Tenchi's mother, Achika. However, Achika starts disappearing and so is Tenchi. They talk to Washu and find out that the criminal KAIN has escaped from the Galaxy Police prison. He is able to travel through time and change the world. KAIN is seeking revenge on the House of Jurai. KAIN decides to end the Jurain line by killing Achika. So, Tenchi and the gang embark on a journey to the 1970's, where Achika is attending high school. Also to note, you will see Tenchi's father, Noboyuki, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Tenchi. The hilarious parts include fights between Aeka and Ryoko, who pose as Achika's students when they are supposed to be bodyguards if KAIN attacks. If KAIN kills Achika, Tenchi will never exist.Get this DVD if you love Tenchi!",5,I Love Tenchi Muyo In Love,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,1047,"['Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'great', 'movie', 'fans', 'OVA', 'original', 'video', 'animation', 'storyline', 'animation', 'superb', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'antics', 'constant', 'rivals', 'Ryoko', 'Aeka', 'story', 'off', 'typical', 'day', 'Masaki', 'house', 'are', 'watching', 'old', 'movie', 'clips', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'Achika', 'However', 'Achika', 'disappearing', 'so', 'Tenchi', 'talk', 'Washu', 'find', 'out', 'criminal', 'KAIN', 'escaped', 'Galaxy', 'Police', 'prison', 'able', 'travel', 'time', 'change', 'world', 'KAIN', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'House', 'Jurai', 'KAIN', 'end', 'Jurain', 'line', 'killing', 'Achika', 'So', 'Tenchi', 'gang', 'embark', 'journey', '1970', 'where', 'Achika', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'Also', 'note', 'will', 'see', 'Tenchi', 'father', 'Noboyuki', 'who', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Tenchi', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'include', 'fights', 'Aeka', 'Ryoko', 'who', 'pose', 'Achika', 'students', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'bodyguards', 'KAIN', 'attacks', 'KAIN', 'kills', 'Achika', 'Tenchi', 'will', 'never', 'exist.Get', 'DVD', 'love', 'Tenchi']",Tenchi the Movie:Tenchi Muyo in Love VHS

400936,A3CYIPLD9090ZK,6304099037,David Baker,"[6, 7]","Simply put--Tenchi The Movie 1: Tenchi Muyo In Love is one of my all-time favorite Anime movies. I love everything about Tenchi (the comedy, the characters, the battle scenes--everything), and I was not disappointed with this movie. First, the animation. It's beautiful. Flawless. Everything is so well drawn--very nice. You just HAVE to see it to know what I'm talking about. Second, the dubbing. Dubbing is a big problem with most anime, but not Tenchi. It just never has been. ALL the characters have AMAZING voice actors (especially Petrea Burchard who does Ryoko). But what's a movie without a great story? Tenchi The Movie delivers a rock-solid story. It may be a little simple, but it delivers nonetheless. Evil force Kain has escaped from his prison and destroys Galaxy Police HQ, then goes to earth and back in time to eliminate Achika Masaki, Tenchi's mom. If Kain were to succeed, there would be no Tenchi, no Kasami family line, and none of Tenchi's friends would have met. Knowing this, scientific genius Washu sends Tenchi, Ryoko (my favorite female anime character of all time, by the way), Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Ryo-Ohki back in time to put a stop to Kain. Thankfully, none of the characters lose their charm in this film--Ryoko and Ayeka are constantly bickering, Kiyone is still frustrated and all too serious, Sasami and Ryo-Ohki are still adorable, and Mihoshi is still an airhead. It was also a nice treat to see what Achika was really like, as well as Nobuyuki (Tenchi's dad) as a shy dreamer (!) instead of his usual comedic self. If I did have one complaint, however, it's that I felt that the movie could have had more humor to it. The series is hilarious (to say the very least), but the humor is substituted for a more serious tone. That's not to say Tenchi The Movie doesn't have its moments though--Ryoko and Ayeka have a hilarious scene in a train, and Mihoshi is, well, still Mihoshi (four words: Mihoshi as a teacher!). And that's not to say its serious tone is a bad thing, as you'll find out, the story is very good.

Somehow, the diappearance of Achika and the escape of Kain are related...Little Washu, as usual, comes to the rescue - her assessment is that something has happened to Tenchi's mother, Achika, in 1970.  Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Kiyone, and Mihoshi must travel back to 1970 to protect Achika, and assure that Tenchi himself does not disappear.  While the movie has an overall melancholic and bittersweet tone, the comic scenes are typical Tenchi hilarity.  As Tenchi and his clique take their positions around Achika, repeated in-jokes and references to episodes of &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; are scattered throughout.The story of Tenchi's immediate family is one which is rarely touched on in any of the television series.  The writers, animators, and English voice talent do an excellent job conveying the pathos of Nobuyuki and Achika's relationship, and the complex ways that Tenchi deals with his family history and heritage.  By far the most interesting thing about the movie is the 'presence-in-absence' of present-day Nobuyuki.  What does present-day Nobuyuki think of the whole situation that his family is exposed to during the movie, and the very precariousness of existence?  The questions raised by Nobuyuki's absence are fascinating to ponder.  Overall, this is a well-done movie, and extremely worth watching for fans of Tenchi and his buddies.",5,Tenchi Is Disappearing!,989452800,"05 10, 2001",2001,2164,"['quot', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'quot', 'yet', 'great', 'Tenchi', 'film', 'product', 'familiar', 'Tenchi', 'television', 'series', 'seen', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'characters', 'relationships', 'situations', 'are', 'combination', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'quot', 'gang', 'present', 'including', 'irrepressible', 'Kiyone', 'plot', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'quot', 'compelling', 'character', 'driven', 'Watching', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'taken', 'father', 'Nobuyuki', '1970', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'subject', 'movie', 'fade', 'disappear.Concurrently', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'are', 'out', 'patrol', 'Galaxy', 'Police', 'when', 'get', 'communique', 'headquarters', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'Kain', 'who', 'escaped', 'subspace', 'prison', 'Somehow', 'diappearance', 'Achika', 'escape', 'Kain', 'are', 'related', 'Little', 'Washu', 'usual', 'rescue', 'assessment', 'something', 'happened', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'Achika', '1970', 'Tenchi', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'Sasami', 'Kiyone', 'Mihoshi', 'must', 'travel', 'back', '1970', 'protect', 'Achika', 'assure', 'not', 'disappear', 'movie', 'overall', 'melancholic', 'bittersweet', 'tone', 'comic', 'scenes', 'are', 'typical', 'Tenchi', 'hilarity', 'Tenchi', 'clique', 'take', 'positions', 'Achika', 'repeated', 'in-jokes', 'references', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'quot', 'are', 'scattered', 'throughout.The', 'story', 'Tenchi', 'immediate', 'family', 'one', 'rarely', 'touched', 'television', 'series', 'writers', 'animators', 'English', 'voice', 'talent', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'pathos', 'Nobuyuki', 'Achika', 'relationship', 'complex', 'ways', 'Tenchi', 'family', 'history', 'heritage', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', ""'presence-in-absence"", 'present-day', 'Nobuyuki', 'What', 'present-day', 'Nobuyuki', 'think', 'whole', 'situation', 'family', 'exposed', 'movie', 'very', 'precariousness', 'existence', 'questions', 'raised', 'Nobuyuki', 'absence', 'are', 'fascinating', 'ponder', 'Overall', 'well-done', 'movie', 'extremely', 'worth', 'watching', 'fans', 'Tenchi', 'buddies']",Tenchi the Movie:Tenchi Muyo in Love VHS

But the reason I am rating this a 4 is because #1 the story moves SLOWLY! It takes a good half hour to get into the main plot line. #2 Unless you REALLY care about the mushy, in depth character development of the story of Tenchi's mother and the story of how Tenchi's parents came to love each other, this whole movie will bore the pants off you. The humor we normally get in a Tenchi flick just isn't here to support this.I understand that the director and screen writers were going for a serious, and meaningful anime movie, and I don't have a problem with that, and to any Tenchi fan - you will need to see this at least once. Maybe not own it, but definitely see it. The story DOES get moving towards the last part, and surprise surprise for a Tenchi story, the plot line does have closure.

Though it seems to borrow it's plot from Back to the Future, the movie is touching, while being frantic at times. There's enough action here to please those who liked the fights in the first two Tenchi series, and there's quite a bit of emotionally charged scenes as well.The Sci-Fi elements of the movie are abundant too, even though the majority of this film takes place in 1971. The tone of the movie is more serious than the comical hijinks of the Tenchi Universe series, but the familiar cast of characters still retain their trademark personalities. Aeka still acts a bit snobbish, Ryoko still is a sarcastic woman who sometimes needs some anger management classes, Sasami and Ryo-Oki are still as cute as buttons, Kiyone still gets fed up with Mihoshi, Washu's #1-scientist-in-the-world ego is still intact, and Mihoshi STILL is a clumsy ditz. One thing's different though; Nobuyuki strangely wasn't a [deviate] as a teenager. What happened here? >:)The DVD comes with a nice supply of extras, though most of them are just text-based info pages and facts. The main menu is sluggish, because Pioneer decided to make every selectable item animated. But thats just a minor gripe. There are two versions of the movie present here; The english and Japanese versions. The English dub's actors are mostly good, except for a few parts where their lines felt stressed(Like when Sasami exclaims that she's put one of the power generators in place, a little too giddy-like). The japanese version's actors are superb, as usual.I didn't like the movie's music; Christopher Franke's 'Hollywood' inspired score was a bit cheesy and sounded like bad MIDI in parts. I missed the orchestral feel of the TV series' music.The animation was a bit better than Tenchi Universe's, so it looked okay.The only thing that made me feel uncomfortable during the film was the strange similarities to Back to the Future; Washu even mentioned the whole Time Paradox thing if Tenchi ever encountered his mother! I almost expected Washu to send Tenchi and the gang in a time-travelling car! But nonetheless, this movie is a great film to show anyone new to anime,or Tenchi fans, or anime fans in general, or even regular movie watchers.",5,Tenchi's 'timeless' encounter...,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,2265,"['three', 'Tenchi', 'films', 'favorite', 'borrow', 'plot', 'Back', 'Future', 'movie', 'touching', 'being', 'frantic', 'times', 'enough', 'action', 'here', 'please', 'who', 'liked', 'fights', 'first', 'two', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'quite', 'bit', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scenes', 'well.The', 'Sci-Fi', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'abundant', 'too', 'even', 'majority', 'film', 'place', '1971', 'tone', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'comical', 'hijinks', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'series', 'familiar', 'cast', 'characters', 'still', 'retain', 'trademark', 'personalities', 'Aeka', 'still', 'bit', 'snobbish', 'Ryoko', 'still', 'sarcastic', 'woman', 'who', 'anger', 'management', 'classes', 'Sasami', 'Ryo-Oki', 'are', 'still', 'as', 'cute', 'buttons', 'Kiyone', 'still', 'fed', 'up', 'Mihoshi', 'Washu', '1-scientist-in-the-world', 'ego', 'still', 'intact', 'Mihoshi', 'STILL', 'clumsy', 'ditz', 'One', 'thing', 'different', 'Nobuyuki', 'strangely', 'was', ""n't"", '[', 'deviate', ']', 'teenager', 'What', 'happened', 'here', '>', 'DVD', 'nice', 'supply', 'extras', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'text-based', 'info', 'pages', 'facts', 'main', 'menu', 'sluggish', 'Pioneer', 'decided', 'make', 'selectable', 'item', 'animated', 'just', 'minor', 'gripe', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'present', 'here', 'english', 'Japanese', 'versions', 'English', 'dub', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'few', 'parts', 'where', 'lines', 'felt', 'stressed', 'when', 'Sasami', 'put', 'one', 'power', 'generators', 'place', 'little', 'too', 'giddy-like', 'japanese', 'version', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'usual.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'music', 'Christopher', 'Franke', ""'Hollywood"", 'inspired', 'score', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'sounded', 'bad', 'MIDI', 'parts', 'missed', 'orchestral', 'feel', 'TV', 'series', 'music.The', 'animation', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'looked', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'was', 'strange', 'similarities', 'Back', 'Future', 'Washu', 'even', 'mentioned', 'whole', 'Time', 'Paradox', 'thing', 'Tenchi', 'ever', 'encountered', 'mother', 'almost', 'expected', 'Washu', 'send', 'Tenchi', 'gang', 'time-travelling', 'car', 'nonetheless', 'movie', 'great', 'film', 'show', 'anyone', 'new', 'anime', 'Tenchi', 'fans', 'anime', 'fans', 'general', 'even', 'regular', 'movie', 'watchers']",Tenchi the Movie:Tenchi Muyo in Love VHS

This fact is the only thing keeping this video from being 5 stars in my book.This first movie in the Tenchi series is a masterpiece.  Not only do we get an hour and a half version of the TV series (which is great in its own right), but we get to see Tenchi's mom and dad as teenagers.  Achika is everything you would think the mother of Tenchi would be: Strong, serious, independent, and capable of incredible power.  We also get an answer to why Achika, the daughter of Yosho, and presumably a powerful Jurai, died when Tenchi was a boy.Normally, I cringe watching dubbed Anime.  Many times American localization: translation and voice casting, results in a horrible piece of work.  But with Tenchi there is both a decent translation and fabulous voicework.  They say their lines with the right tone, pitch and inflections, and they are just the right kinds of voices for the roles they play (KT Vogt as Washu is one of my favorites).  So don't even listen to people when they tell you Tenchi Dubbed is bad.The only confusion of the story is the title.

Davidson,"[2, 4]","""Tenchi Muyo! in Love"" (aka ""Tenchi: The Movie""), while not a total disaster, is a pretty disappointing entry in the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" franchise.The movie's biggest weakness is its plot. The totally uninteresting Kain never becomes anything more than a cackling villain-of-the-week. The writers seem to be making up the story as they go along, with holes, dead ends, and deus ex machinas all over the place. The pace varies wildly, with some scenes galloping so fast it's hard to digest what's happening, and other sections taking forever to make simple points.On the plus side, the animation is impressive, and Tenchi's mother Achika is a charming, intriguing character. Ryoko and Ayeka's squabbling is entertaining as always, but with no real character development to speak of, it comes off as a little tired.I would really only recommend this movie to a Tenchi completist. The sequel ""Tenchi Muyo! in Love 2"" (aka ""Tenchi Forever!"") is a vast improvement.",2,Haphazard film debut doesn't do justice to the Tenchi characters,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,955,"['Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'Tenchi', 'Movie', 'not', 'total', 'disaster', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'entry', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'franchise.The', 'movie', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'plot', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'Kain', 'never', 'anything', 'more', 'cackling', 'villain-of-the-week', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'up', 'story', 'go', 'along', 'holes', 'dead', 'ends', 'deus', 'ex', 'machinas', 'place', 'pace', 'varies', 'wildly', 'scenes', 'galloping', 'so', 'fast', 'hard', 'digest', 'what', 'happening', 'other', 'sections', 'taking', 'forever', 'make', 'simple', 'plus', 'side', 'animation', 'impressive', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'Achika', 'charming', 'intriguing', 'character', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'squabbling', 'entertaining', 'always', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'speak', 'off', 'little', 'tired.I', 'would', 'really', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Tenchi', 'completist', 'sequel', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', '2', 'Tenchi', 'Forever', 'vast', 'improvement']",Tenchi the Movie:Tenchi Muyo in Love VHS
