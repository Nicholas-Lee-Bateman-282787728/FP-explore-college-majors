1618456,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00AYGVCCK,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[24, 30]","It is said that some daughters are attracted to their fathers at some point in their lives. Those kinds of feelings are rarely explored in cinema, as they are delicate issues to deal with. The unforgettable ""Hemel"" takes a sincere and penetrating approach to this facet of life, and it triumphs in every level.Hemel (Hannah Hoekstra) -- which means heaven in Dutch -- is a gorgeous 23 year-old woman who we meet right at the beginning of the film, in a chapter called ""Genital Phase."" Here, we find Hemel with what we assume is her boyfriend, both totally naked, on a bed, somewhere before, during or after sex - or none at all. Their talk is aggressive and inflammatory, with the male lover asking Hemel, ""You don't shave, do you?"" And Hemel answering, ""Why?"", and her boyfriends telling her, ""You have a hairy c--t."" Hemel, not particularly happy, responds, ""Yes. And?"" To which her lover says, ""I'm not a bushman."" Still unhappy, Hemel tells him, ""Oh, you are a child molester."" The lover then asks, ""Ever had a mouthful of pubic hair?"" And so goes this formidable scene, a Kodak moment of real life. From then on, the movie evolves into small chapters exploring Hemel's sexual life and her close relationship with her father - she doesn't have a mother. We'll witness how Hemel deals with several lovers, always finding something wrong with them, including one Algerian man, whose tenderness bothers her. She tells him that she didn't ""like afterplay, petting after an orgasm. It's more masculine to fall sleep after sex, like lions."" She also talks harsh to and is sarcastic with her loved ones, including her father. However, it is her father that she trusts more and seems to want to imitate.Director Sacha Polak says that ""Hemel"" is about a father and daughter who have a symbiotic relationship. This seems true as you watch the film, as you see a beautiful, conflicted young woman insecure about life and love. This is powerful, real-life filmmaking. The DVD includes interviews with Hoekstra, Polak, and screenwriter Helena Van Der Meulen; a 12-page collectible booklet; and more.

Foreign films can suffer two types of error -- the obvious translation / subtitle error and the other error not limited to foreign films: a lack of coherence in the scripting.Early in the film we see the young Hemel going on a bed-hopping spree that for the most part satisfies her physical needs, but leaves her emotional development needs unmet.  The director makes it clear from the explicit nature of the couplings that tab A indeed goes into slot B.  OK but the adult audience knows this already.There is almost an antiseptic aspect in play in that while the scenes are explicit, there is not much of an erotic atmosphere generated. It is difficult for the actors and the director to pull this off but they manage to do so.  One suspects that this was intended to ward off overeager censors and convince them that it is necessary for the film.  I got the uncensored version by the way.We get this much:  Hemel is a girl having more than her share of problems moving into womanhood. She grew up without her mother, and she has attached too strongly to her father. (The story leaves the viewer to decide if any incest is / was involved). Hemel's father brings home several attractive women home to live with him as long as their relationship lasts and it is clear on some primal level that Hemel sees them as competition.But after figuring out the above, one is left with a what does all this mean?

I guess it's no surprise how who we become will always - in some way - be tied back to who we started out as and how we were raised.  There will always be some linkage between parents and children - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, etc. - and how these relationships change throughout our respective growth can be the source of immense appreciation or utter disenchantment.  What brings us together may not be as strong as what drives us apart, but how we face those challenges will always show us something about our flaws and our strengths.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Hemel (played by the lovely Hannah Hoekstra) - which is Dutch for `Heaven' - is a young woman just over the cusp of womanhood who's engaged in a constant struggle to identify `love' in her life.  With much abandon, she flees from one sexual entanglement to the next, rarely conscious of the risks to her body or the inevitable damage to her psyche.  Still, she desperately clings to Gijs (Hans Dagelet), her father - her mother passed away early, leaving him to raise him on her own.  However, when it looks like Gijs is ready to move on with the new woman in his life, what realization will this force onto Hemel, and can she survive the split?HEMEL is a character study that focuses in on a flawed father/daughter relationship.  Sacha Polak directs a script penned by Helena Van Der Meulen about the sexually-charged Hemel trying to cope with her arrival into adulthood.  Her affairs are quick and (essentially) meaningless, though she strives on each occasion to place meaning within each of them.  What she ends up doing in the process is becoming nearly exactly what these men don't want or need - her first suitor clings to ideals of a different body type; her second suitor prefers cuddling after lovemaking while Hemel will have nothing to do with it; and a married man wants `sex with detachment' while she longs to be his soulmate.  In her attempts to find happiness, she unintentional evolves into something men no longer covet; this only forces her to try even harder next time.Eventually, Hemel is forced to face the harsh reality that the central man in her life - her father - can no longer provide her with the kind of undivided attention or affections she's been privy to for most of her life.  This rejection (of sorts) causes the young woman to even desperately test the boundaries of physical attraction to her father as she plies for more and more notice.  These scenes are certainly not played out with any glamor; in fact, there's an odd air of emotional detachment to images one would normally associate between a husband and wife as they play out with Gijs and his daughter.  Neither truly understands one another, though both would claim otherwise, and the sum total of their conflict forces them further apart as happiness is only attainable when sought elsewhere.To their credit, Hoekstra and Dagelet make the most of their moments together.  There's an undefined chemistry to what their characters feel for one another, and only two artisans entirely committed to telling this story - with Polak's direction, of course - can pull off so much effortless affection and sublime discomfort with one another, especially given the fact that most folks might find the subject matter so very disturbing.  Still, their performances make this tale not only possible but believable, and I'll definitely be on the lookout for them in future works down the creative road.HEMEL is produced by Circe Films, Vrijzinning Protestantse Radio Omroep (VPRO), Jaleo Films, and Bella Cohen Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through Artsploitation Films.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Dutch-spoken-language film with English subtitles.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2012 Berlin International Film Festival; was nominated for `Best Film' at the 2012 Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema; was nominated for the New Talent Grand Pix Award at the 2012 CPH:PIX; as well as being singled out for praise at the 2012 Nederlands Film Festival and the 2013 Rembrandt Awards.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds exceptional, and there's some impressive cinematography at work consistently.  Lastly - as is often the case - the disc is slim on special features: there are two brief (five minute) interviews, one with Ms. Hoekstra and one with Ms. Polak.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Granted, this may not be to everyone's liking, but HEMEL was a brilliant character study examining two fundamentally flawed individuals who - despite their worst instincts - were perhaps perfect for one another for only a brief, fleeting time.  The story of a father's love for his daughter and his young girl's exploration of her own feelings makes for solid viewing.  The sex and nudity - for the record, it's NOT incestuous - are tasteful (for the most part) as Hemel tries harder and harder to secure a place of comfort with the men she meets.  As the tagline goes ""sex isn't everything, it's the only thing,"" she's a woman who only understands one form of communication, and that's bound to lead her to some heartache.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Artsploitation provided me with an advance DVD copy of HEMEL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Flawed

There are some erotic movies or romantic movies with erotica in it or porn movies that has some story line; all of these movies you may want to watch with your partner. Hemel is not one of those movies. It has full frontal nudity ( male and female) but not sex act. Without nudity, what you may call sex scene would get PG-13. next thing to mention is the subject of the movie, the story line and conversations between character. it is nude, blunt, vulgar. it could get R rating based on language. And father-daughter relationship portrait as border line, platonic level incest. Mostly from daughter's perspective. Then and an unexplain scene in the movie. While she is sleeping, calls her dad- by the way she never called him Dad, father or any other version of it but by his name- when he comes in her room. he says&#34; you need to pee ( out of no where, really) and picks her up, carries her to bathroom. Pulls down her panties( nothing showed but profile view), she sits and pees. Scene ends. Why was there? What purpose it served? Have no idea. Entire movie is like that. I purchased the DVD and it was not censored at all. but like I said, save your 20 box and browse internet if you wanted to see nude female for free! let me tell you here. if you are somewhat into close family relations! go rent or buy movie called &#34;spank the Monkey&#34; You will be entertained.
