I would have walked out if I wasn't with other people.The screenplay was terrible, characters were not fully explained enough to understand why they did the things they were doing. All we knew is that they had to do that to fit into the romantic comedy cliches. Or when things were explained like Jolie's character being overly concerned with appearances, we were beat over the head with over and over. After just a few minutes of the movie, everything that happened became cringe-inducing, by either it's ridiculous set-up or the fact that it's happened 100X better a hundred times in other movies.Another thing about this movie was it's outdated views in which a woman cannot have a meaningful relationship and an meaningful work life at the same time.But the worst part about this film was the few times it was pretending it was an art film by using irrelevant and 'artistic' point of view shots.

I know that this is not a movie to be taken serious, but when it comes to romantic comedies laced with a `message', there have been far worse.  Jolie is dynamic here, delivering one of my favorite performances from her (that Razzie nomination is rather ridiculous, for this deserved to be mentioned by the Globes in their `Comedy/Musical' category).  She completely captures what this character is all about, adding the right amount of snarky bite to her character's obvious emotional resistance, and her tender and believable shift from self-absorbed and guarded woman to that soft and heartfelt woman is of the perfect pitch.But look at me getting ahead of myself here.Angelina plays Lanie, a Marilyn Monroe-esque picture of perfection who gets the scoop of her life (she's a reporter) when she interviews a homeless man who professes to tell the future.  Apparently, Lanie is going to die soon.  Of course, why would she believe the words of a homeless man; but then again, he has accurately predicted the outcome of some sports games so maybe he knows what he's talking about.So, what's a girl to do?Well, if that girl is Lanie Kerrigan, she starts reevaluating her priorities and finding within herself the courage to change, for the better.Sure, this is not anything new and it is nothing truly profound (it's funny to me when they try and make a moral statement in films like this) but it is fun and sharp witted, and while the realization of that said `prophesy' is somewhat forced for me, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment one feels while watching Angelina Jolie sink her teeth into a role that is really rich with many layers of complexity.  She is dramatic, romantic, comedic and poignant, and she handles each layer with elegance and dedication.Say what you will, but she is top notch here!",4,Jolie's layered performance elevates this generic fluff...,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,1915,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'negative', 'remarks', 'here', 'especially', 'considering', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'performance', 'know', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'when', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'laced', 'message', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'worse', 'Jolie', 'dynamic', 'here', 'delivering', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'Razzie', 'nomination', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'deserved', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Globes', 'Comedy/Musical', 'category', 'completely', 'what', 'character', 'adding', 'right', 'amount', 'snarky', 'bite', 'character', 'obvious', 'emotional', 'resistance', 'tender', 'believable', 'shift', 'self-absorbed', 'guarded', 'woman', 'soft', 'heartfelt', 'woman', 'perfect', 'pitch.But', 'look', 'getting', 'ahead', 'here.Angelina', 'plays', 'Lanie', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe-esque', 'picture', 'perfection', 'who', 'scoop', 'life', 'reporter', 'when', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'tell', 'future', 'Apparently', 'Lanie', 'going', 'die', 'soon', 'course', 'why', 'would', 'believe', 'words', 'homeless', 'man', 'then', 'again', 'accurately', 'predicted', 'outcome', 'sports', 'games', 'so', 'maybe', 'what', 'talking', 'about.So', 'what', 'girl', 'do', 'Well', 'girl', 'Lanie', 'Kerrigan', 'reevaluating', 'priorities', 'finding', 'courage', 'change', 'better.Sure', 'not', 'anything', 'new', 'nothing', 'truly', 'funny', 'when', 'try', 'make', 'moral', 'statement', 'films', 'fun', 'sharp', 'witted', 'realization', 'said', 'prophesy', 'somewhat', 'forced', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'feels', 'watching', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'sink', 'teeth', 'role', 'really', 'rich', 'many', 'layers', 'complexity', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'comedic', 'poignant', 'layer', 'elegance', 'dedication.Say', 'what', 'will', 'top', 'notch', 'here']",Life or Something Like It

There are several reasons why I liked the movie but not a lot of reasons to make me think it's one of the best ever made.  First off, any fan of Angelina Jolie shouldn't think twice about seeing this movie.  She continues to prove time and again what a versatile actress she is.  And if anyone else had played her role, this movie would have come across extremely boring.  The rest of the cast was well chosen but they definitely weren't enough to carry the movie by themselves.  The addition of Stockard Channing was a very fitting one as she did an excellent job of playing the network news equivalent of Jenny Jones meets Barbara Walters.  And Edward Burns does an adequate job of playing Jolie's cameraman and part time love interest.The story itself had a lot of interesting elements to it.  Angelina Jolie plays Lannie Kerrigan, a Seattle Reporter who is living the perfect life, or at least what she thinks is the perfect life.  She has the perfect body, the perfect hair, a major league baseball player as her fiance, and is one step away from her perfect network news anchor job in New York City.  Everything is running according to plan, when one day, while on assignment she is given some life altering news.  A street prophet tells her that in one week she will die.  At first she dismisses his prophecy as nothing to be taken seriously, but as his other predictions come true, her perfect world starts to unravel.  She is forced to look at every aspect of her life and realizes that everything she thought was so important doesn't really matter.  What follows is a mixture of sometimes funny and at times depressing series of events that teach her the true meaning of what a perfect life really is.All in all a solid movie to go and see.  The performances were all done very well, with Angelina Jolie being the bright spot in the whole movie.  There were several memorable scenes, including the impromptu singing of  ""Satisfaction"" during a bus driver strike.  This movie was definitely a feel good comedy from start to finish, with a few sad parts that were necessary to bring the viewer back up.  And my personal favorite scene was Jolie and her fiance taking batting practice.  It just really cracked me up.  This isn't a movie you have to see in theatre's by any means, but would be well worth the rental price sometime for a date night at home.The Breakdown:1.  Plot-8 (neat structure for a romantic comedy)2.  Characters-8 (very detailed and well developed)3.  Flow-9 (moved along quite nicely)4.  Atmosphere-9 (you can tell a lot of thought went into the setup)5.  Cinematography-8 (not a lot of creativity but didn't look low budget either)6.

He was certainly handsome enough and did a good job in the scenes in which he appeared (I understand a kissing scene had been cut), and he even got to sing a few bars of one of his band Kane's songs, Sweet Carolina Rain, but it didn't do as much for him as he and his fans hoped, unfortunately.  Evidently the best showcase for Christian's talents is still the television series Angel, in which he played the morally ambiguous lawyer Lindsey McDonald for 15 episodes in the first and second seasons.

As wonderful as Angelina Jolie's screen presence might be, and as likeable as this movie should be, it's a dreaded piece of claptrap that assumes that the audience is just like its selfish, boorish, philosophically near-sighted main character, who doesn't realize that you should live each day as if it is your last.  Well, for one, who hasn't heard that phrase one million times already?  Two, sure you should live a meaningful life, but the message is misguided: if I lived every day as if it were my last, I would quit my job, get a beach chair, and sit on a beach in Maui while a bevy of supermodels poured me Mai Tais.  The problem is that I, and no one else, can really do that.  But more important is the fact that this film would have worked if it had delivered that message without having to explain it in such an obvious, insult-your-intelligence kind of way.This film, of course, requires a willing suspension of disbelief.  Jolie's Lanie Kerrigan has been selfish and materialistic her whole life, but in just a few days she changes her entire world view and life style because a bum on the street says she has a week to live.  OK, so let's assume you can accept the premise of the film, which is interesting in and of itself, but then you have to put up with Ed Burns's character constantly reminding you to stop and smell the roses and with Jolie's strained attempt to reconcile relationships and find what matters -- and all this happens without any sense of magic or wonderment or even soul-enriching humor.  It's all paint-by-numbers.  Woman and man hate each other.  Woman and man fall in love.  Man loses woman.  Man regains woman.  Happy ending.  Yawn.OK, ok. Sometimes the formula can work (although it doesn't in this film).  But under no circumstances could I ever believe that a local tv reporter, even with a major-league baseball boyfriend, would ever be living in the kind of high-end apartment with the interior design that Kerrigan does in this film.  Even if her baseball boyfriend could afford it, it wouldn't look like that. That small detail is a microcosm of the entire film: meaning it's as well thought out as a generic romance novel.

Then in the second half it becomes to mushy and because a chick flick.That's not the case with this movie Life or Something Like It. Life or Something Like It starts off funny and in the second half is both. It's a regular second half except they stick in alot of comendy. This movie is also very likable because it sticks a drama bit inside it too. hat's three genre's that are kept at a good pace spread out during the movie. That to me is an outstanding achievement. Keeping the genre that the movie was assigned as could be rough but this movie kept three genre's running which is difficult.The movie stars Angelina Jolie who was never my favorite actress. Her worst movie I thought was Lara Croft Tomb Raider. This she makes up for that even though she shouldn't have made her hair blonde. Her co-star is Edward Burns which was a new actor to me. I want to see his other movie Sidewalks of New York because of the ranting reveiws but never got to that. But Burns is the reason that I gave the movie four stars. I thought that his acting was weak and his display of character didn't show as much as Jolie's acting.Stockard Channing is another co-star is the movie. I was never crazy about her and I also thought her preformace was weak. The best actor of the whole movie had to be Tony Shalob who is always a great actor. Shalob is known for his fame in Monk,Spy Kids,and an episode of Frasier earlier in the 90's.The movie is about Lanni Kerrigan(Angelina Jolie)who is a TV reporter for a station in Seattle. She's trying to get a promotion to play a co-host on a talk show called AM U.S.A. To prepare her for that her boss makes her work with Pete(Edward Burns)who is a cameraman. Lannie and Pete don't get along well because of her thoughts about herself and his comments. Lannie is engaged to Cal who is her live in boyfriend and also a baseball player. Lannie's father Pat is also in the movie who Lannie thinks favors her married sister Gwen. Pete and Lannie get assigned to do a story on Prophet Jack(Tony Shalob) who is a street steer who is known for his on the money predictions. Jack informs Lannie that in one week she is going to die. Lannie doesn't believe him untill all of his other preiditons come true. Lannie tries to find out if Jack was right about her death. Pete suggests that mabey she should start to act differtly and instead of following rules and orders try to have a little fun in life.

But I am a sucker for anything with Tony Shalhoub in it, even in a small but pivotal role he plays here. Shalhoub's versatility elevates almost any project with which he is associated from mediocrity to something a bit better. I found that to be the case here as well. What is an interesting concept is given a mediocre treatment. Lanie Kerrigan (a bleach blonde Jolie) is an up and coming Seattle tv reporter, perfectly primed for a plum network job (this is her ambition/dream). Teamed with cameraman Pete (Ed Burns), Lanie delivers standard reporting. One day she interviews a homeless ""prophet"" on the street (the excellent Shalhoub), who predicts various things that later come true. One of his predictions is that Lanie will die on a certain day in two weeks. Lanie comes to take his predictions seriously when all of the other predictions come true. Pete tries to calm Lanie down; Lanie has singlemindedly pursued her professional dreams at a high cost: she has completely lost touch with herself/who she is really. You get a hint of the ""Lanie inside"" in a scene in which she is unkempt, wearing her glasses, in front of her baseball player boyfriend, and he has no clue who she really is... and it seems she too has fallen out of touch with who she really is. In these self-conscious and introspective moments, when Lanie questions her identity (faced with the likelihood of her mortality), the movie hits a kind of peak. Unfortunately there is very little chemistry between Jolie and Burns, so their romantic spark lacks authenticity. However, though the ""get up"" (perfect make-up and ridiculous hairdo) is glossy and rather fake, Jolie imbues her role with a certain gravity that lends her character (and her going through the stages of denial and acceptance of her fate) believability. Unfortunately the film as a whole never quite hits its mark, and as a romantic comedy fails because it is not very funny and not very romantic.

715466,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006G8JD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","""Life or Something Like It"" is one of those films where the idea is intriguing, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The central character is Lanie Kerigan (Angelina Jolie), a hot young feature reporter for a Seattle television station who has a chance of her dream job for the network's morning show, ""AM USA."" Lanie is paired up with the station's best cameraman, Pete (Edward Burns), although these two clearly have a past that makes this a rocky relationship and assures us that they will end up together before too long. One day Lanie is out on the street filming an interview with Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub), a homeless man who is supposedly psychic. During the interview Jack makes three predictions. First, the Seattle Seahawks will win their game 19-13. Second, it will hail the next day. Third, Lanie will die next Thursday. This last one gets her attention.Of course Lanie is skeptical. But when the first two predictions come true, she starts to become concerned and when Jack offers another prediction that comes about, she really starts to freak. Somewhere in her background Lanie must have studied classical mythology, because she does not really try to thwart her fate, although it takes her a while to accept it. This is for the good, because if she decided that she would stay home in bed all day on Thursday she would end up in a car accident on Wednesday night and linger until the next day. Trying thwart a prophecy only makes things worse; just ask Jocasta and pay attention to how the prophecy in Sophocles' tragedy changes).The first problem with this 2002 film is that it is a romantic comedy that takes itself too seriously one moment and not seriously enough the next. Feel good movies tend to have scenes where people burst into song, and we have that here. I like the song, but for that character to lead that group in that song at that particular moment is really not a good move (except that the people who wrote the script liked it, so it does work out for the best). People who are actually in the business of television news must be laughing themselves silly at all the stupid bits about their profession in this business; my favorite, but not in a good way, was this idea of showing an interview at 7 in the morning on the east coast live on the west coast.Ultimately this film gets reduced to a simple platitude and it is at that point that ""Life or Something Like It"" really betrays its promise. What would have made this film really work is not that it works on a universal level to which we can all relate, but if it drives the point home in terms of Lanie's character in some memorable way. There are a few conventional and unimaginative efforts, but nothing that crystallizes into a transcendent scene that elevates this film to a truly meaningful level. Even if you do not see the ending coming, I doubt that you are going to be surprised that this film wants to have its cake and eat it too.Jolie's character has trouble shedding her on-camera persona enough to provide true depth to an examination of her life that gets beyond her brave smile, which is different from her on-camera smile. Her romance with Burns is by the numbers and I found myself wishing the film had tried to do more with her relationship with boyfriend Cal Cooper (Christian Kane, an actor who is going to break through in films the way he did on television's ""Angel"" some day soon), who plays for the Seattle Mariners, because I actually liked his idea of how to try and help her and I thought there was the possibility there for something different. There will be those that really like this film, but even that minority should have no problem in articulating ways in which it could have been so much better.",3,An interesting idea for a story but very uneven results,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,3736,"['Life', 'Something', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'idea', 'intriguing', 'execution', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'central', 'character', 'Lanie', 'Kerigan', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'hot', 'young', 'feature', 'reporter', 'Seattle', 'television', 'station', 'who', 'chance', 'dream', 'job', 'network', 'morning', 'show', 'AM', 'USA', 'Lanie', 'paired', 'up', 'station', 'best', 'cameraman', 'Pete', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'two', 'clearly', 'have', 'past', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'too', 'long', 'One', 'day', 'Lanie', 'out', 'street', 'filming', 'interview', 'Prophet', 'Jack', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'supposedly', 'psychic', 'interview', 'Jack', 'three', 'predictions', 'First', 'Seattle', 'Seahawks', 'will', 'win', 'game', '19-13', 'Second', 'will', 'hail', 'next', 'day', 'Third', 'Lanie', 'will', 'die', 'next', 'Thursday', 'last', 'one', 'attention.Of', 'course', 'Lanie', 'skeptical', 'when', 'first', 'two', 'predictions', 'come', 'true', 'become', 'concerned', 'when', 'Jack', 'prediction', 'about', 'really', 'freak', 'Somewhere', 'background', 'Lanie', 'must', 'have', 'studied', 'classical', 'mythology', 'not', 'really', 'try', 'thwart', 'fate', 'while', 'accept', 'good', 'decided', 'would', 'stay', 'home', 'bed', 'day', 'Thursday', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'car', 'accident', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'linger', 'next', 'day', 'Trying', 'thwart', 'prophecy', 'only', 'things', 'worse', 'just', 'ask', 'Jocasta', 'pay', 'attention', 'how', 'prophecy', 'Sophocles', 'tragedy', 'changes', '.The', 'first', 'problem', '2002', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'too', 'seriously', 'one', 'moment', 'not', 'seriously', 'next', 'Feel', 'good', 'movies', 'tend', 'have', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'burst', 'song', 'have', 'here', 'song', 'character', 'lead', 'group', 'song', 'particular', 'moment', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'move', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'liked', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'business', 'television', 'news', 'must', 'be', 'laughing', 'silly', 'stupid', 'bits', 'profession', 'business', 'favorite', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'was', 'idea', 'showing', 'interview', '7', 'morning', 'east', 'coast', 'live', 'west', 'coast.Ultimately', 'film', 'reduced', 'simple', 'platitude', 'point', 'Life', 'Something', 'really', 'promise', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'really', 'work', 'not', 'universal', 'level', 'can', 'relate', 'point', 'home', 'terms', 'Lanie', 'character', 'memorable', 'way', 'are', 'few', 'conventional', 'unimaginative', 'efforts', 'nothing', 'transcendent', 'scene', 'film', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'level', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'doubt', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'surprised', 'film', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'character', 'trouble', 'shedding', 'on-camera', 'persona', 'enough', 'provide', 'true', 'depth', 'examination', 'life', 'brave', 'smile', 'different', 'on-camera', 'smile', 'romance', 'Burns', 'numbers', 'found', 'wishing', 'film', 'had', 'tried', 'do', 'more', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'Cal', 'Cooper', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'actor', 'who', 'going', 'break', 'films', 'way', 'did', 'television', 'Angel', 'day', 'soon', 'who', 'Seattle', 'Mariners', 'actually', 'liked', 'idea', 'how', 'try', 'help', 'thought', 'was', 'possibility', 'there', 'something', 'different', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'film', 'even', 'minority', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'articulating', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Life or Something Like It
715467,AP913L912U09T,B00006G8JD,manndrake,"[0, 0]","&#34;Life Or Something Like It&#34; is an enjoyable romantic comedy despite a title that is too long and too generic.  The concept--A homeless man who sees the future tells an ambitious television newswoman that she has one week to live--is interesting.  The plot is well structured, and the theme, expressed openly in voice over at the end, is easy to agree with.Many people feel that Angelina Jolie was miscast in this movie, and, considering her roles in action movies or her films about the horrors of war, that might seem reasonable.  But, if you set aside that body of work and watch her in this film, it becomes obvious that she understands the genre and knows exactly what she is doing.Tony Shalhoub is excellent as Prophet Jack and Greg Itzin is a fine character actor.  This movie's shortcoming is that Edward Burns does not have the star stature to stand toe to toe with Ms. Jolie.  For most of a romantic comedy the leads are adversaries, so they must have equal status in the eyes of the audience.  The dialogue between Mr. Burns and Ms. Jolie is sharp, but it just doesn't crackle on the screen.  In Another comedy, &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Smith,&#34; the dialogue comes across much better because Ms. Jolie and Brad Pitt have equal standing.Even if you don't like romantic comedies, hang on until the &#34;bus strike&#34; scene comes along, and maybe you will join Ms. Jolie and drivers as they hop to the beat, pump their fists in the air, and belt out &#34;Satisfaction&#34; along with the Rolling Stones.",4,Satisfaction,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1516,"['34', 'Life', 'Something', '34', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'title', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'generic', 'concept', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'future', 'ambitious', 'television', 'newswoman', 'one', 'week', 'live', 'interesting', 'plot', 'well', 'structured', 'theme', 'expressed', 'openly', 'voice', 'end', 'easy', 'agree', 'with.Many', 'people', 'feel', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'miscast', 'movie', 'considering', 'roles', 'action', 'movies', 'films', 'horrors', 'war', 'might', 'seem', 'reasonable', 'set', 'aside', 'body', 'work', 'watch', 'film', 'obvious', 'genre', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing.Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'excellent', 'Prophet', 'Jack', 'Greg', 'Itzin', 'fine', 'character', 'actor', 'movie', 'shortcoming', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'not', 'have', 'star', 'stature', 'stand', 'toe', 'toe', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'leads', 'are', 'adversaries', 'must', 'have', 'equal', 'status', 'eyes', 'audience', 'dialogue', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'sharp', 'just', ""n't"", 'crackle', 'screen', 'comedy', '34', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', '34', 'dialogue', 'across', 'much', 'better', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'have', 'equal', 'standing.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'hang', '34', 'bus', 'strike', '34', 'scene', 'along', 'maybe', 'will', 'join', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'drivers', 'hop', 'beat', 'pump', 'fists', 'air', 'belt', 'out', '34', 'Satisfaction', '34', 'Rolling', 'Stones']",Life or Something Like It
715468,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00006G8JD,Martin Asiner,"[5, 5]","For newsreporter Lanie Kerrigan life is much like her platiunum blonde hair--perfect.  She thinks she has it all: smashing good looks, regular aerobics at a trendy gym, a famous ballplayer boyfriend, and a big paycheck.  Then one day, she meets a sidewalk seer who tells her that she will die within one week. Of course, she doesn't believe him, but when his other predictions come true, she thinks maybe this one will happen too.Part of the charm of LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT is that director Stephen Herek takes us from a place that we think we know and want--our glitzy work life--and to a place that we dare not even contemplate--the sureness of the end of life and how we live just prior to the closing of the curtain.  Angelina Jolie is Lanie, in one of the most appealing roles of a surprisingly long career for such a young actress.  Lanie seems like the typical bland bubblehead that appears daily on our tv screens--all hair, all teeth, and not an original thought in that lovely but empty head.  But we soon enough find that beneath the glitter there is a woman who seeks more than what she thinks she wants, but doesn't yet know it.  She begins to see cracks in her life.  She has long had an ongoing dispute with her sister about whom their father always favored.  She recognizes that her baseball boyfriend's idea of conflict resolution is to take nightly batting practice.  She has tantalizing remorse about an affair with a co-worker (Edward Burns) that turned out badly but only because he did not fit in with her planned Big Scheme of Things.  Then this sidewalk seer Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub) tells her that she will die next week.  All of a sudden, she has to regroup and reprioritize.  Prophet Jack makes it easy for her.  He tells her of the stages that she must pass through from denial to anger to acceptance.  Lanie goes through each, with each one forming a subplot to the movie.  The most revelatory step occurs on air when she breaks all the rules in a street corner interview with strikers by leading them in a rousing head-shaking rendition of the Stones' I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION.  Later, she passes through the final step in another on air interview with powerwoman Deborah (Stockard Channing) when she again deviates from the script in another attempt to secure journalistic integrity.Yes, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT is a puffed up piece of romantic fluff comedy but the interaction between Jolie, Burns, Shalhoub, and Channing are solid enough so that as Lanie passes through her prophetic stages to achieve inner calm, so do we.  When Lanie claims her prize of affirmation, again vicariously so do we.

Her colouring is just too dark to pull off being blonde, and she so suits being her natural colour.The story could have been a whole lot more interesting if it had tapped into the religious and philosophical side of finding out you only had one week left to live.

I expected a quirky comedy with the usual guy-gets-girl storyline.  What I got was something I could relate to.Have you ever wondered if decisions you've made have made your life more or less meaningful?  Lanie (Angelina Jolie), a Seattle TV reporter, has 7 days to figure that out.  After an interview with a homeless, self-proclaimed prophet, she's not so sure.  You see, the prophet has predicted that, not only will she not get the big network job she's been striving for, but that Lanie will die the following week!  With the help of cameraman Pete (Edward Burns), Lanie works on making her life meaningful before time runs out.  And of course, in true romantic comedy fashion, she falls in love along the way.Not only did I enjoy watching the movie, but I could tell that the actors enjoyed making the movie.  In my favorite scene, Lanie leads a crowd of striking transit workers in a rousing rendition of the Rolling Stones hit ""Satisfaction"".

715475,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00006G8JD,Priscilla Stafford,"[6, 13]","Angelina Jolie plays Lanie, a news reporter with her whole life laid before she. She has a nice job, a handsome jock for a boyfriend (Christian Kane), and it seems she just might get the job promotion of her dreams! No matter what anybody says, especially annoying cameraman Pete (Edward Burns), Lanie believes her life is perfect. Unfortunately, everything starts going haywire when she interviews a homeless calling himself 'Prophet Jack' (Tony Shalhoub). When Prophet Jack says that Lanie is going to die in a little less than a week, Lanie of course doesn't believe him. But when all of Jack's other 'future revelations' become true, Lanie begins to wonder if she really IS going to die!*PLOT* - I must say that movie really had potential to become a great movie. It poses the question of 'what if you were going to die, what would you do'? Lanie's character in the movie starts to question her 'perfect life', including her relationship with her father, sister, and boyfriend. She starts to realize that she really hasn't lived her life to the fullest and begins to come out from her stiff ways. I thought that this part of the story was really interesting. Plus her relationship with Pete is so cute, though in the beginning they can't stand each other, you just KNOW that in the end they're going to fall in love. Unfortunately, some parts of Lanie and Pete's romance just doesn't seem to come together. Another bad point is that after maybe the first 30 minutes, the movie goes downhill after that. In the beginning my attention was kept on the screen and I was really interested to know what happens to Lanie. But as the story goes on, I came close to just not caring about the ending and just wanted the movie to finish. Plus the humor starts to diminish after maybe the first 30 minutes or so, making the movie feel dry.*ACTING* - The acting is on the mediocre side, each actor and actress doing their part but not really giving the characters a chance to fully develop. In the beginning where Jolie and Burns have their bantering, I thought they delivered their lines very well.*PG-13 RATING* - The movie is rated PG-13 for language and sexual content. I think that the romance between Jolie and Burns would have worked out better without any of the sexual content.*OVERALL* - Overall, it's no wonder for me that the movie never really made it. Though it had the potential, the movie suffers from a stretched thin plot, not enough humor, and a bit of an unrealistic romance. I'd pass this movie on if I were you. But I can recommend this movie for die-hard Angelina Jolie fans since you'll get to see a lot of her. I give 2 stars for ""Life or Something Like It"" only because it had some potential and I thought the first part was funny and entertaining.

715478,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006G8JD,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","An interesting concept, though more conducive to late night coffee house musings and discussions than a feature length film treatment, provides a pleasant, if less than insightful vehicle for it's star, in ""Life or Something Like It,"" directed by Stephen Herek, wherein the oft reflected upon question, ""What would you do if you found out you had only a week to live?"" becomes a showcase for the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie, albeit a rather vapid and shallow one.  Still, it gets the job done, inasmuch as it is entertaining (to a point), has one interesting (though underused) character and will give die-hard Jolie fans, especially, something to revel in.  The problem is that the late night ruminations the filmmakers begin about the meaning of life end long before the store closes, and anything ""meaningful"" that may have come of it is left on the table for another time and another movie.  Suffice to say, this isn't Bergman; but then again, it wasn't meant to be.Lanie Kerigan (Jolie) is a field reporter for a local television station in Seattle, a ""personality"" of the affiliate's news team, covering human interest stories and events in and around the Emerald City.  She's engaged to Cal Cooper (Christian Kane), who plays ball for the Seattle Mariners, and all in all her life is nearly perfect.  And it will be ""absolutely"" perfect if she lands the job she's just learned she's up for:  A spot on the network's prestigious morning show, which originates from New York and is broadcast nationally.  Yes, for Lanie, except for being teamed with an incorrigible (in her estimation) cameraman, Pete (Edward Burns), life is good.  With her very next assignment, however, all of that is going to change.His name is Jack (Tony Shalhoub); he's a homeless, self-professed ""prophet"" who lives in a makeshift cardboard box and is given to ""visions"" which enable him to predict such things as the score of the next Sea Hawks game, or if it is, in fact, going to hail in the morning, regardless of the weatherman's forecast.  He's a colorful character, just right for a ""Lanie"" segment; but even before the actual interview begins, Jack tells Lanie two things:  1.) She's not going to get that job she so desperately wants, and 2.) come next Thursday (one week away) she is going to die.  And just like that Lanie's life isn't so perfect anymore.  She's about to take that long walk on a short pier...To whip up this repast for his audience, director Herek manages to crack the egg and get it in the skillet, but he forgot to turn on the burner, so it never cooks; it just kind of lays there in the pan.  It looks good, but how many people enjoy raw eggs?  The screenplay (by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens) lacks originality to begin with, and Herek shows little imagination in his handling of the story and the characters, so it never really comes to life, despite the efforts of Jolie.  And from the information we're given, or even from what is implied about the relationship (past and present) between Lanie and Pete, the ""romance""-- such as it is-- just doesn't fly, even within the parameters of ""romantic comedy"" (Is THAT what this is?).  The biggest problem with the film, though, is that it fails to connect you emotionally with any of the characters; these just aren't people you care enough about to make it involving or maintain interest.  Add to that the fact that, even though this is light fare, it simply lacks the credibility necessary to make it work.  In the end, the audience would have been better served had Herek thrown in a couple more ""yokes.""The film suffers something of an identity crisis, and gets caught up in a dilemma of it's own making; just what is it trying to be?  A romantic comedy?  If so, it fails.  Or is it striving to be a satirical exploration of a question perhaps too profound for the genre in which Herek is apparently working?  In which case it also fails.  It would have been much better for all concerned had the focus been on the relationship between Lanie and Jack the prophet, as THIS is where the real interest of the story lies.  The myriad possibilities this afforded remained untapped, however, as the filmmakers opted for another route which, unfortunately, never made it to the Promised Land.As far as showcasing Jolie, it does; but that is not to say that it presents her in the best possible light, the fault of which lies entirely with the inherent nature of the character.  Lanie is just too career minded and self-absorbed to be a thoroughly engaging ""personality,"" and it dulls the sparkle of what could have been.  Even her ""epiphany"" is not enough to make her star shine in this role.  As Lanie, Jolie looks the part; she's beautiful, even alluring.  But with this particular character, she seems to lose that edge, that intensity, that sparks her usual charismatic screen presence, which is absent here, as well.  So even though this film is essentially a ""showcase"" for Jolie, it simply does not do her justice.As for Edward Burns, can he dance?  Because if they ever make ""The Gene Kelly Story,"" this is the guy.  It's the timbre of his voice, so reminiscent of Kelly's (but it CAN be grating after awhile).  Burns is a good actor, and he gives a solid performance here, but his character, Pete, even after his ""personal"" story comes to light, just isn't that interesting.The saving grace of the entire film is Tony Shalhoub's portrayal of Jack, a character that will capture your imagination.  The trouble is, you don't see enough of him, and it's a dreadful waste of a potentially great character and storyline; a dreadful waste of the magic that could have made ""Life or Something Like It"" a film to remember.",3,"Something for ""Angelina"" Fans to Revel In",1035417600,"10 24, 2002",2002,5697,"['interesting', 'concept', 'more', 'conducive', 'late', 'night', 'coffee', 'house', 'musings',

715479,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00006G8JD,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","There are few surprises in this film, but Angelina Jolie is irresistibly delightful in this fun comedy about a television woman who is told by a sidewalk prophet that she has a week to live.  Although she has done comedy before, she has never been in a romantic comedy before, and I hope that this won't be her last.  She is easily one of the most beautiful women in the world, but what makes her especially delightful is her charismatic onscreen personality, and that devastating smile, framed by the most amazing mouth this side of Michelle Pfeiffer.Angelina and Ed Burns make an appealing couple, and they project good onscreen chemistry.  You like them as a couple, and pull for them to somehow manage to get together.  Tony Shaloub is one of the more versatile character actors in Hollywood today, and he is excellent in his smallish but crucial role of Prophet Jack.The film is also gorgeous to look at, and not just when Angelina is the focus.  The film is marvelously photographed from beginning to end, and if sometimes the shots serve less to further the story than to create attractive images, one can't complain that it isn't successful at that.The only weakness in the film is the fact that the plot is too predictable.

715480,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006G8JD,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 11]","""Life, or Something Like It"" is a romantic comedy with a better-than-average premise.  It attempts to address the question ""if you suddenly discovered that you might only have a week more to live, how would you spend that remaining time and what changes would you make to your life?""  Perhaps because this IS a romantic comedy, the best the film can manage to do within the tight strictures of the format is to raise a few of the more provocative issues surrounding the theme - those dealing with the meaning of life and the vagaries of fate, for example - then drop them so it can address itself to the customary clich&eacute;s one would expect to find in a film of this genre.  One only wonders how a more serious-minded European filmmaker, for instance, might have tackled the same subject matter.Angelina Jolie plays a beautiful, but thoroughly superficial and self-absorbed TV news reporter living a near-perfect life in Seattle.  Indeed, when we first meet her, Lanie Kerigan seems to have everything going for her: stunning good looks, a glamorous profession, a handsome major league ballplayer fianc&eacute;, and now a major career advancement in the form of a regular spot on a national morning news program.  One day, however, her world comes crashing in when she meets up with a homeless man on the street, a self-styled ""prophet of God"" who tells Lanie that she will die within a week.  When all his other predictions begin to come true, Lanie realizes that this man may not be quite the lunatic or charlatan all her friends and acquaintances keep assuring her he is.Given this setup, ""Life, or Something Like It"" can't help but grab our attention.  We wonder how we too would react to such a horrifying scenario if it were to suddenly present itself in our own lives. The problem is that the movie doesn't really do much with the material it has to work with.  Nothing Lanie does seems particularly thoughtful or meaningful when she is confronted with potentially imminent death: indulging in some halfhearted attempts to reconcile herself with an estranged sister and father, giving up her health-obsessive diet and exercise regimen, and dumping the fianc&eacute; with whom she discovers she has nothing in common.  Considering the thematic potential of this material, the film always seems to be lagging several intellectual beats behind where it should be.  This is particularly true in the predictable love/hate relationship she shares with Pete, one of her cameraman coworkers.  Yet, oddly enough, it is this very pairing of Jolie with Edward Burns that gives the film its moments of greatest charm.  Both performers are so likeable in their understated warmth and vulnerability that we can't help liking and rooting for their two endearing characters.  Paradoxically, then, the film satisfies us most when it is at its least innovative.  The movie is at its worst in an embarrassingly unconvincing scene wherein a boozed-up Lanie, sans makeup and carefully groomed coiffure, leads a contingent of striking workers in a rendition of ""Satisfaction"" in the middle of a live TV interview.  Cloying moments like these merely serve to remind us that we are stranded in movie fantasy land when the film could, with a little more effort, have ascended to a much higher level.  (The film, incidentally, endorses a rather reactionary view of women in the workplace, arguing that a woman needs to consider whether achieving success in the corporate world is worth sacrificing a chance at achieving marital and familial happiness - a quandary that never seems to be posed to male characters in movies).And this, alas, is the overall impression that ""Life, or Something Like It"" ends up generating.  Despite the fact that it has moments of quality and charm, the film, ultimately, feels like a case of lost opportunity.  One finds oneself leaving this film in a state of frustrating ambivalence: acknowledging that the film works on a level of superficial entertainment but knowing that, with a little more depth and insight, it could have amounted to so much more.",3,"not bad, but fails to live up to its potential",1019865600,"04 27, 2002",2002,4071,"['Life', 'Something', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'better-than-average', 'premise', 'address', 'question', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'might', 'only', 'have', 'week', 'more', 'live', 'how', 'would', 'spend', 'remaining', 'time', 'what', 'changes', 'would', 'make', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'best', 'film', 'can', 'manage', 'do', 'tight', 'strictures', 'format', 'raise', 'few', 'more', 'provocative', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'theme', 'dealing', 'meaning', 'life', 'vagaries', 'fate', 'example', 'then', 'drop', 'can', 'address', 'customary', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'film', 'genre', 'One', 'only', 'how', 'more', 'serious-minded', 'European', 'filmmaker', 'instance', 'might', 'have', 'tackled', 'same', 'subject', 'matter.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'beautiful', 'thoroughly', 'superficial', 'self-absorbed', 'TV', 'news', 'reporter', 'living', 'near-perfect', 'life', 'Seattle', 'Indeed', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'Lanie', 'Kerigan', 'have', 'everything', 'going', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks', 'glamorous', 'profession', 'handsome', 'major', 'league', 'ballplayer', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'now', 'major', 'career', 'advancement', 'form', 'regular', 'spot', 'national', 'morning', 'news', 'program', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'world', 'crashing', 'when', 'up', 'homeless', 'man', 'street', 'self-styled', 'prophet', 'God', 'who', 'Lanie', 'will', 'die', 'week', 'When', 'other', 'predictions', 'begin', 'come', 'true', 'Lanie', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'lunatic', 'charlatan', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'keep', 'assuring', 'is.Given', 'setup', 'Life', 'Something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'grab', 'attention', 'wonder', 'how', 'too', 'would', 'react', 'horrifying', 'scenario', 'were', 'suddenly', 'present', 'own', 'lives', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'material', 'work', 'Nothing', 'Lanie', 'particularly', 'thoughtful', 'meaningful', 'when', 'confronted', 'potentially', 'imminent', 'death', 'indulging', 'halfhearted', 'attempts', 'reconcile', 'estranged', 'sister', 'father', 'giving', 'up', 'health-obsessive', 'diet', 'exercise', 'regimen', 'dumping', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'whom', 'nothing', 'common', 'Considering', 'thematic', 'potential', 'material', 'film', 'always', 'be', 'lagging', 'several', 'intellectual', 'beats', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'particularly', 'true', 'predictable', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'shares', 'Pete', 'one', 'cameraman', 'coworkers', 'oddly', 'enough', 'very', 'pairing', 'Jolie', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'film', 'moments', 'greatest', 'charm', 'performers', 'are', 'so', 'likeable', 'understated', 'warmth', 'vulnerability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'rooting', 'two', 'endearing', 'characters', 'Paradoxically', 'then', 'film', 'satisfies', 'most', 'when', 'least', 'innovative', 'movie', 'worst', 'embarrassingly', 'unconvincing', 'scene', 'wherein', 'boozed-up', 'Lanie', 'makeup', 'carefully', 'groomed', 'coiffure', 'contingent', 'striking', 'workers', 'rendition', 'Satisfaction', 'middle', 'live', 'TV', 'interview', 'Cloying', 'moments', 'merely', 'serve', 'remind', 'are', 'stranded', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'land', 'when', 'film', 'could', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'have', 'ascended', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'film', 'incidentally', 'rather', 'reactionary', 'view', 'women', 'workplace', 'arguing', 'woman', 'consider', 'achieving', 'success', 'corporate', 'world', 'worth', 'sacrificing', 'chance', 'achieving', 'marital', 'familial', 'happiness', 'quandary', 'never', 'be', 'posed', 'male', 'characters', 'movies', '.And', 'alas', 'overall', 'impression', 'Life', 'Something', 'up', 'generating', 'fact', 'moments', 'quality', 'charm', 'film', 'ultimately', 'feels', 'case', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'One', 'leaving', 'film', 'state', 'frustrating', 'ambivalence', 'acknowledging', 'film', 'level', 'superficial', 'entertainment', 'knowing', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'insight', 'could', 'have', 'amounted', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Life or Something Like It

She was very skeptical about his prediction -- until quite a few of his other predictions became true.From the minute Jolie's character is delivered the gruesome news about her ""death,"" to the scene where she discovers the seer's earthquake prediction come true, we witness a vulnerability and frailty that is rarely seen in Angelina Jolie. It comes as something of a revelation, especially when seeing many of her other films.From that moment, and on, she begins to undergo an evaluation of her life, and as a result, we see a vital transformation in her character throughout the rest of the movie. She also develops a poignant love connection with Edward Burns' character, which possibly may have been foreseen, as the two exhibited considerable sexual tension, along with the hilarious bickering swapped between them in the earlier parts of the film.So, did Angelina Jolie's character die? Was the seer's prediction accurate? You'll just have to watch the film, as I refuse to give any of that away.All in all, a light, poignant romantic comedy with considerable dramatic attributes. Once again, Angelina Jolie gives a rare performance, as there are many traces of vulnerability that are seldom seen in her other performances.

715483,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00006G8JD,Shashank Tripathi,"[3, 3]","Angelina Jolie first caught my eye in the bubble-gum action of ""Tomb Raider"". I passed her off as a pop actress.Then I happened to see ""Playing by heart"" and was utterly surprised by her acting caliber. And now in this otherwise strangely conceptual film, she creates another magical web in a near-Oscar performance as newswoman Lanie Kerigan. During the course of the movie, Lanie goes through the entire spectrum of emotions from joy, to fear, to anger, to sadness, to optimism, to anxiety...and Angelina captures them immaculately proving once again for me her fabulous versatility.Theme-wise the movie is simplistic, it could easily have gone down a ""Wonderful Life"" kind of a touchy-feely drain, but it doesn't. The narrative develops engrossingly, and intelligently. I can't figure out why the ""general audience"" can't get into these movies more, movies that make you feel and think.There are even humorous moments, supported well by Edward Burns who plays a cameraman-cum-friend, plus the somewhat doozy but never boring Tony Shalhoub as ""Prophet Jack.""What could perhaps have made the movie a bit more clever and inspiring would be to have ended it about 10 minutes before it actually does. Most of its sweet, witty moments are lost in a pathetic denouement that moralizes that it is only heterosexual love and marriage (which includes taking your husband's name -- even though you have built a career, stock portfolio and life with yours) that can ultimately save a woman from herself. I can think of at least ten other ways to have ended the movie without messing up the smartness of the rest of the plot.Yet, definitely a watchable movie. If you're like me it may even provoke some introspection.

So when I think a movie is &quot;just ok&quot;, I never argue if the rest of the world thinks its atrocious.So I guess I'll start off by saying that I thought this movie was: Far-fetched, too long, boring in most parts, and badly acted (with the exception of Jolie, who I recognize is a big exception seeing as she's the star). With that in mind, you'll understand when I say I don't even want to know what a real film critic would have to say about this movie.I gave it three stars because I like Jolie and (as I mentioned above) she was fine - if you can forgive for ever putting on that that blonde wig. But I would not classify this as a &quot;good movie&quot; or even say that I liked it.For starters: Edward Burns cannot act. The guy is a joke. Maybe he is a decent director/writer/whatever else it is but whoever first let him in front of the camera should be shot.And I won't even go into the amount of things that just didn't make sense about the plot, because in romantic comedies the script writer isn't supossed to have trouble tying up loose ends.However, in retrospect the 'Life or Something Like It' was not entirely unenjoyable. I've already said I didn't exactly like it, however I didn't hate it either.Who knows what it was, maybe Edward Burns can work his so called &quot;magic&quot; even on those who find him untalented and ugly, or maybe it was Jolie's performance that saved this potential trainwreck from being too horrible.
