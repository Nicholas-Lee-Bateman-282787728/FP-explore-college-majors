380009,AORW1FRF4D4KS,6303567126,azindn,"[2, 3]","If Leonardo diCaprio had not already made this film, he would be cast immediately for the role of lifetime. Mr. diCaprio's performance as the lanky, audacious, and attitude-heavy high school basketball player whose descent into heroin-hell is the true story of the author, Jim Carroll, can only be described as superb. As often as diCaprio is cited for his Titanic performance, &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is one for his resume of fine, solid performances. With cameras in streets of lower Manhattan, the junkie life of a street urchin is neither fun nor games, it is pathos and crime. Teens who flock to diCaprio films should see &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; as a point of information. When the glamorous veneer of heroin and cocaine wears off, all that is left is the sight of diCaprio -- frothing at the mouth, twisting, and screaming in pain as the cold turkey rehabilitation program of friend, Ernie Hudson takes over his body. Most young girls, the rabid diCaprio fans, would find this scene too realistic and too ugly. But that is what the author intended. In a too brief cameo appearance, Carroll's words are at times glorious poems of haiku grace, but his own speed rap about his memories of a Catholic ceremony is a monologue chilling in its irony, for he is cooking up to fix while he speaks. Fine performances from the young supporting cast including a thuggish Marky Mark Walberg and a heart wrenching Lorraine Bracco as the mother who can do nothing for her son but call the police make &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; worthy of everyone's attention.

However, that comes 90 minutes too late to save what should have been an interesting biopic. The loss is now more poignant, given Carrol's recent death at age 60. Songs from Carroll's four rock albums dot the soundtrack, and the script is based on the book Carroll wrote at age 17 depicting his grim youth as a Catholic school drug addict in NYC. If only watchers were advised of these accomplishments at the film's beginnings, and then given a tour backward in time, the movie would have benefited.

380011,A22IK3I6U76GX0,6303567126,Calle,"[2, 11]","This movie portrays a number of teenage students who quit school and become criminals and drug addicts. That could be quite interesting. What ruins the movie is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in the lead part. He is quite annoying in all his movies but in this one, it goes to extremes. He is so overacting and after a while my brother and I started laughing when he cried and at his facial expressions. All the close up shots of his face don't make things better. His character is supposed to be 16, I believe. Leonardo DiCaprio was actually about 20 but looks like 14. The only character I really cared about and felt sorry for was his mother (Lorraine Bracco). The sequences that are supposed to show what is going on in Jim's imagination could have been better made especially the one where he's running though a field of flowers.Like I said, the lead performance makes the movie quite annoying to watch. It's also a bit dull and it doesn't have anything new to say.

380012,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6303567126,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","Shortly before he died of a drug overdose River Phoenix was asked what he was going to do next. He took a dog eared copy of The Basketball Diaries out of his pocket and said he wanted to play Jim Carroll. The Basketball Diaries project did get made, except with Leonardo DiCaprio instead of Phoenix. At the risk of being typecast River was set to follow that by playing the poet Arthur Rimbaud in Total Eclipse. DiCaprio picked up that role as well. The Basketball Diaries turned out pretty well for Leo, and was also a good break for Mark Wahlberg. There was however one unintended consequence: the students at Columbine copied not only DeCaprio's black trench coat, but also his violent fantasy of shooting up the school.Copy cat killers are a large problem for film makers. Oliver Stone tried to make a statement about violence and how it was glorified in movies and the news media with Natural Born Killers. Result: Copy cats. Seems like Stone fell right into his own trap (Juliette Lewis is in Basketball Diaries and Natural Born Killers, by the way). Take Taxi Driver as another example of what can go dreadfully wrong.I don't have any answers but am just pointing out the pitfalls for an artist who tries to address serious social issues with a very powerful and seductive medium. The Basketball Diaries also had to be careful not to glorify heroin. It kind of did in the first part, but then it tried to make up for it in the second part by showing a lot of puking and screaming--which is good as a cautionary tale, but it doesn't necessarily make for the best feel good movie of the summer.On the other hand, I also feel that the book that Jim Carroll wrote was misrepresented by the movie. Stephen Lang turned down the part of Swifty the basketball coach that went to Bruno Kirby because he felt the book was misrepresented. But that's Hollywood for ya. They made it into much more of a standard cliche plot, a cautionary tale, more like an after school special.Still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the Jim Carroll story is quite a compelling one. Though at a young and tender age he was a petty criminal, heroin addict, and prostituted himself to support his drug habit, he managed to turn it around and become a successful poet, author, and rock musician. Carroll was also a high school basketball star, which can't be easy when your double life is a junkie. He also had a cameo in The Basketball Diaries playing, what else? a junkie. So, add acting to his already impressive resume. Also, though they tinkered with the book somewhat, there is plenty of verbage lifted directly from it, and his prose style always lifts the material above the mundane.-------------Jim Carroll: And it's good that there is rain. It clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions, and it clears the streets of the silent armies... so we can dance.===========================The basketball scenes are exhilarating, as are all the early scenes before the negative effects of addiction take hold. Besides a great performance by DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg also acquits himself well, as do Michael Imperioli and James Madio. Imperioli plays Bobby, a basketball star buddy of Carroll's who is dying of leukemia. Madio plays Pedro, who although too short to play on the basketball team, is nevertheless kind of the team mascot and a member of the gang.Music plays a vital role in the film, and the song ""People Who Died"" is especially effective since Carroll wrote and performed it, and some of the people in the lyrics, like Bobby, for instance are the ones in the movie, and Carroll's own real life. Also great are Patti Smith's ""Dancing Backwards,"" ""Riders of the Storm"" by The Doors, and the musical high point for me, ""Down by the Water"" by PJ Harvey. Her album, To Bring You My Love, had just come out in 1995, the year the film was released, and though the song didn't yet exist at the time period the movie was supposed to be in, it nevertheless managed to capture the feeling.The Basketball DiariesLiving at the Movies (Poets, Penguin)Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries: 1971-1973The Book of NodsCatholic BoyNatural Born Killers -

If not cheap then certainly far from overly expensive. The reason for the success of these films is that they are genuinely good. After you got past the effects, was Titanic, Gladiator, Pearl Harbour, AI or Independance Day really that good? In fact, Pearl Harbour has many people's votes (although not mine since I'll admit I haven't seen it myself) as one of the worst films ever made.Basketball Diaries is a gritty and low-budget film. This doesn't shy away behind special effects or fancy graphics. What you see is what you get. The story is a harrowing tale of drug abuse, which starts with low-class drugs like glue and weed, and works it's way up to heroin. I think it is actually a true story, which makes it all the more chilling. When it starts it reminds you of yourself growing up - the first time you may have experimented, had sex or did something dangerous; how you behave with your mates. But it becomes detatched, showing you the harsh reality of what can happen when relatively harmless drug dabbling turns into a daily addiction.All in all, Basketball Diaries is brilliantly executed film.

Next if you liked blow, harsh times or what doesn't kill you, you will like this, if you never heard of thouse  movies or didn't like them then this wont be for you. This isn't your standard predictable sports movie where they are down by 20 at half time get a cheeseie speech and they go out and win and the main guy gets the cutest girl in school. This is a true story about a kid that coulda been a state champ and got a scholarship to play at a college had he not gotten kicked out and thrown away his life chasing his next bag. This shows 1st hand what its really like to be a homeless drug using teen. Shows what he goes through his friends his mother, shows some 1 close to him that tries to help but gets burned and even shows what its like after you clean up and change you life around and run into an old using buddy that's still runin and gunin. Shows how easy it is to start out having fun here and there and the next thing you know you through your whole life away and wake up 1 day like how did this happen to me? I related do to my own story of drug use from 14 to 24 so when I see this movie I see me, so that could have a lot to do with why I like it soo much. No other movie comes even close to showing what its really like out there. If you wana see real life drama that will break your heart this is the movie, but if you want Hollywood explosions or happy endings with a story you can always guess whats happening next you might wana stay away from this, a lot of people don't like to see how the other half live and that's fine, but don't bash 1 of the best movies ever cause you have very basic taste in film",5,"great movie, shows what its really like, leos best acting ever",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2017,"['Theres', 'soo', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'lot', 'people', 'leaving', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', ""n't"", 'xmen', 'pirates', 'Caribbean', 'so', 'Im', 'gona', 'start', 'explaining', 'lil', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'self', 'film', '1st', 'Leos', 'best', 'acting', 'only', 'heath', 'joker', 'even', 'close', 'skills', 'shown', 'film', 'Next', 'liked', 'blow', 'harsh', 'times', 'what', ""n't"", 'kill', 'will', 'like', 'never', 'heard', 'thouse', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'wont', 'be', ""n't"", 'standard', 'predictable', 'sports', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'down', '20', 'half', 'time', 'get', 'cheeseie', 'speech', 'go', 'out', 'win', 'main', 'guy', 'cutest', 'girl', 'school', 'true', 'story', 'kid', 'been', 'state', 'champ', 'got', 'scholarship', 'play', 'college', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'kicked', 'out', 'thrown', 'away', 'life', 'chasing', 'next', 'bag', '1st', 'hand', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'homeless', 'drug', 'using', 'teen', 'what', 'friends', 'mother', '1', 'close', 'help', 'burned', 'even', 'what', 'like', 'clean', 'up', 'change', 'life', 'around', 'run', 'old', 'using', 'buddy', 'still', 'runin', 'gunin', 'how', 'easy', 'start', 'out', 'having', 'fun', 'here', 'there', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'whole', 'life', 'away', 'wake', 'up', '1', 'day', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'related', 'do', 'own', 'story', 'drug', 'use', '14', '24', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'why', 'like', 'soo', 'much', 'No', 'other', 'movie', 'even', 'close', 'showing', 'what', 'really', 'there', 'wana', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'movie', 'want', 'Hollywood', 'explosions', 'happy', 'endings', 'story', 'can', 'always', 'guess', 'whats', 'happening', 'might', 'wana', 'stay', 'away', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'live', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'bash', '1', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'cause', 'have', 'very', 'basic', 'taste', 'film']",Basketball Diaries VHS

Having such a dubious association I was reluctant to view this film.  Having now seen it I can see my reticence was unfounded.  This is a gripping account of a talented teen, Jim Carroll(Leonardo DiCaprio), and his descent into the hell that is serious heroin addiction.  The film depicts how even the best of us can be insidiously seduced by our innate desire for kicks to try such a horribly addictive drug.  DiCaprio, who has since matured into one of our finer actors with his role in ""The Aviator"", shows early signs of the promise since fulfilled.  Mark Wahlberg is also good as Carroll's best friend who also falls into the heroin trap.  Good turns are provided by Lorraine Bracco as Jim's concerned mother and Ernie Hudson as Reggie, Jim's best friend even if he doesn't know it.

I knew it had to do with drugs and basketball. However, in 2011, I saw the movie in full (uncut, to be more precise) on DVD. And now I can appreciate it even more. Aside from DiCaprio's riveting performance, I can see just how tragic the fall from grace had become. I can't be sure if Jim Carroll's autobiographical account is completely accurate in this film, but I don't think it matters here. The story, which involves sports and drugs and redemption, is compelling enough for me to recommend it. Fantastic performances from DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Hudson, and others. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.Would I say that this film is perfect? Of course, not. It does have its few flaws (a couple of moments of lousy dialogue and overacting), but they're minimal and aren't distracting in the slightest.

Trainspotting and other movies may cover a drug, or a lifestyle better, but nothing captures the tragedy of an individual like DiCaprio's performance in Basketball Diaries.  The defining moment is DiCaprio, pounding on his mother's door, begging for $20 so that he can score just one more hit.  His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, huddles on the other side of the door, crying, and fighting the maternal instincts to help her son, when she knows he can not be helped.  The cry that Leo gives out, as he pulls his cap down over his face in frustration, a sixteen-year-old crying for his mommy, because it all hurts too much to cope.  That is the face of addiction.  DiCaprio's cry comes from his belly, the whiny tantrum cry of a four-year-old who just can't understand why he can't get his way.  And yet, underneath that, one gets the sensation of the turmoil and pain within his heart, and the ultimate sadness that eats away at him.This movie introduced me to the beautiful and edgy work of Jim Carroll, the star of the latest Beat generation.  His story is so captivatingly told through the performance of DiCaprio.  However, the supporting cast is also spectacular.  Mark Wahlberg deliveres a great support perfomance, as a cohort in drug addiction, helping to supply pills, glue, heroin, and the like.Keep an eye out for an early performance by Michael Imperioli, of Sopranos fame, playing a teammate of DiCaprio and Wahlberg, who passes away during the film.  Yet one more devastating event in Carroll's life.There are some stylistic choices made by the director that may not fit with some people, but they are only a minor detail in a very powerful and honest film.",5,A cry felt in the belly.,1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,1878,"['who', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'world', 'hard', 'core', 'street', 'drugs', 'violent', 'consuming', 'grip', 'can', 'have', 'point', 'movie', 'maybe', 'quintessential', 'performance', 'individual', 'addict', 'Trainspotting', 'other', 'movies', 'may', 'cover', 'drug', 'lifestyle', 'better', 'nothing', 'tragedy', 'individual', 'DiCaprio', 'performance', 'Basketball', 'Diaries', 'defining', 'moment', 'DiCaprio', 'pounding', 'mother', 'door', 'begging', '20', 'so', 'can', 'score', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'hit', 'mother', 'played', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'other', 'side', 'door', 'crying', 'fighting', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'help', 'son', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'cry', 'Leo', 'out', 'cap', 'down', 'face', 'frustration', 'sixteen-year-old', 'crying', 'mommy', 'too', 'much', 'cope', 'face', 'addiction', 'DiCaprio', 'cry', 'belly', 'whiny', 'tantrum', 'cry', 'four-year-old', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'yet', 'underneath', 'one', 'sensation', 'turmoil', 'pain', 'heart', 'ultimate', 'sadness', 'away', 'him.This', 'movie', 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'edgy', 'work', 'Jim', 'Carroll', 'star', 'latest', 'Beat', 'generation', 'story', 'so', 'captivatingly', 'told', 'performance', 'DiCaprio', 'However', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'spectacular', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'great', 'support', 'perfomance', 'cohort', 'drug', 'addiction', 'helping', 'supply', 'pills', 'glue', 'heroin', 'like.Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'early', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Sopranos', 'fame', 'playing', 'teammate', 'DiCaprio', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'away', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'devastating', 'event', 'Carroll', 'are', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'made', 'director', 'may', 'not', 'fit', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'minor', 'detail', 'very', 'powerful', 'honest', 'film']",Basketball Diaries VHS

Leonardo DeCaprio is at once, cool-minded, suave, insightful, and, (playing a character who was once revered for his skills on the basketball court and in writing but who faces a serious drug problem), deadly accurate in playing the role of what drugs and taking a wrong turn can do to a person.  The plot starts off pleasantly enough.  Leo is an aspiring writer living in the poor side of New York City.  He is a star athlete who hangs around three buddies---all with goals of mischief, basketball, and being just boys.  One fateful night, one pal introduces the easily influenced Leo to drugs and sex......and the plot then focus almost exclusively on his  downward spiral of a new life filled with drugs, hustling, theft, and homelessness.  He, along with another addict friend (played by Mark Walburg---who is also a serious character actor and excellent), quit school, leave home and turn into thugs.  The aspiring writer can no longer function; he is derilict, dependant on herion and crack, and without a family.  And it is here that DeCaprio displays a superb range of acting skills.  He is so believable in his reactions to life on the streets, in crack houses, and the wild display of emotion, of self-hatred, of dispair is beautifully portrayed.  In fact, I found myself often shaking my head at the life thrown away.  Though the story ends on a positive note and with a wake-up call, the themes of how a single life can take a disasterous turn in one night is strongly felt.  I agree with what one other reviewer says: the message of this movie actually &quot;screams&quot; to teenagers that drugs are evil, as is throwing one's life down the drain, along with all hope, opportunity, and a potentially bright future.  Between the acting, the storyline, and the turns in plot, &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is a great movie.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a Catholic school student, it shows him enjoying being part of a winning high school basketball team, sniffing glue and taking part in petty crimes.  It's set in a Hollywood version of a gritty New York Manhattan neighborhood, and, as a New Yorker myself,  I must say I was confused about exactly where it was.DiCaprio writes poetry in a notebook and visits a dying friend in the hospital.  I guess that's supposed to show how sensitive he is.  There are also some supposedly moving scenes where he is strung out on drugs and begging his mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, to give him some money.  However, in spite of his tears and his rantings and ravings, he never became a sympathetic character to me.  Maybe it was because of script, which didn't let the audience know exactly what it was that either turned him to drugs or made him stop.  And maybe it was because he just can't stop being Leonardo DiCaprio.Mark Wahlberg is cast as one of his pals, and so is James Madio.  And Julliette Lewis has a small part as a young prostitute.  All these people are just background though for DiCaprio, who is in every single scene and whose character dominates the film which is blissfully only 103 minutes long and moved fast enough to hold my attention.

This movie descends into the depths of depravity and sadness. DiCaprio, as another reviewer wrote ,amazingly was but 20 years old when he turned in this powerhouse of a performance. Little by little we see the way he gets into this lost soul and makes him so believable and pathetically authentic. One of the  best moments is when Dicaprio and the 2 buddies who followed him down into the sewers of human existence see the young man whowas a part of the gang but he stayed clean and persued his dreams as a basketball player. He is up there on the television living a healthy happy life than any of the three others could have shared. The look in Leonardo's eyes says it all, even in his drugged up state there was a miniscule possibility that he could get himself together and return to a decent life. Another wonderful scene was when the actor Ernie Hudson, takes DiCaprio home, seeing himself many years ago in a similar crisis and wanting to do the right thing to help a fallen friend. That was heartwrenching with DiCaprio deprived of heroin having a meltdown while Hudson tried to be a support, ignoring the most disgusting behavoir by Leonardo who looked like a wounded bird just trying to make it through the next 15 minutes. Also as brilliant as DiCaprio is Lorraine Bracco, who we will always of course think of as Tony Soprano's shrink, playing DiCaprio's Mom with love and she too has her own emotional meltdown in that wonderful scene where she is on one side of the door, and he is leaning in across the chain, desperate for a few bucks to feed his habit. She is forced to call the cops on her own out of control son. Of course this movie is based on a real man who found his way back to a happy and healthy and sane existence. How triumphant !!!

380041,A1XH3UYZC8DEY5,6303567126,Milkman,"[0, 0]","Don't take my middle of the road three star rating as a sign of apathy.  This movie is one you will either love or hate, and in my case I very much enjoyed certain things and very strongly disliked others.Obivously the big draw in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio.  I have to say, he does an outstanding job with this role.  In the true story of drugged-out high schooler Jim Carroll, he thrives on the type of script Academy Awards are made out of: tons of opportunities for him to be high, low, enraged, in sorrow.  There are a lot of opportunities to use his physicality in the role, and he seizes every one.  In particular I think of his drug withdrawal sequence and he and his friends' mourning the death of a close friend by getting drunk and playing basketball in the rain.The plot has a sixteen year old Jim Carroll playing high school basketball.  Three of his teammates are his best friends, and when not on the basketball court, they tend to find all kinds of ""innocent"" trouble around New York (knocking over food vendor carts, for instance).  Another outlet of energy for Jim alone is his diary where he records sensations he feels in his young life.His search for sensation and his friends' desire to find trouble coalesces in experiments with drugs like cocaine and herione.  As Jim notes in the monologue of the movie, there is no such thing as a part-time addict.  They fall further and further into the downward spiral in an effort to evade pressures from school teachers, coaches, and parents.Some of the scenes in this movie are very gripping and visceral.  However, the links between these scenes tend to be bogged down in poor directing.  I realize this movie was a lower budgeted one, but there really is no excuse for having a movie made in 1995 that looks like it was made in 1985.  While the performance by DiCaprio is extraordinary, the directing is lackluster.  Poor camera angles, helpless lighting, bit part actors who look and sound amateur; those should all be blamed on the director.However, this movie is worthwhile if you are one who has a particular interest in either Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg (he stars as a main character and one of Jim Carroll's best friends), or the subject matter.

The point of this whole film was a teenager who got addicted to drugs and what happened to him. The main character could have been anybody, really. There are lots of young teenagers and kids out there who are addicted to drugs and this is the kind of thing that can happen to them. I think that is what director Scott Kalvert was trying to show the world...not a story about Jim Carroll, but a story on how drugs can affect your life and everyone else in it.

Such should be encouraged, or perhaps forced, two watch DiCaprio's two most powerful early performances: as Johnny Depp's retarded brother in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and as author Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries. DiCaprio's career may have taken a huge turn for the stupid, but in these two films, he proves himself a consummate professional.I never associated the Jim Carroll of The Basketball Diaries, somehow, with the Jim Carroll whose 1985 cult hit &#34;People Who Died&#34; has become a mainstay of the classic-rock frat-house drinking party crowd. And the plot of TBD pretty much parallells the first couple of verses of the song; if you've got the hang of one, you'll get the hang of the other.Carroll was a basketball player at a New York catholic school in the late seventies, being scouted by the majors along with a couple of his friends, growing up poor but honest, and an aspiring writer to boot. Not the world's most notable existence, but a good one, until the flirting with drugs that he and his three friends did got out of hand. The turning point is the death of his friend Bobby (Michael Imperioli, last seen trying and failing to save Summer of Sam) from leukemia at 16. From there, Jim, Pedro (James Madio), and Mickey (a young Mark Wahlberg, in the role that took him from cute boy-band idol into serious actor-ville) descend ever deeper into the world of heroin addiction, while their erstwhile friend Neutron (Patrick McGraw) serves as a yardstick of what might have been had they stayed clean and sober.DiCaprio shines.

As a movie, the story comes alive with a powerful impact. Director Scott Kalvert does not make the movie into an obvious anti-drug message, instead the story of Carroll's teen years is simply just...told. There is almost a documentary-like realism in how scenes are put together, nothing feels false but instead chillingly real. Anyone who has lived in an environment like this or attended high school in the more gritty, violent sections of a city can instantly relate to the people and events. The actors bring these characters to live with great believability, Leonardo DiCaprio broke through with this role, but even his recent work in films like &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; seems more tame compared to his brilliant, effective performance here. The scenes where Carroll is addicted to heroin and lives in the junkie underworld are performed by DiCaprio with a vivid realism that is disturbing. One reviewer here complained about the movie missing a plot, plot is not something central here, the story is central and it is the story of a very talented young man gripped by addiction in a world where vices and the darker side of life can easily suck you in. And of course, there is some great music here by Soundgarden, The Doors, The Cult and a great highlight which is Carroll performing &quot;Catholic Boy&quot; with Pearl Jam. In the history of rock music there are many popular stories of addiction from Iggy Pop to Scott Weiland, Carroll's is brought to life in a movie that breathes and doesn't need to throw the message in your face, the message is right there in the story itself.",5,"Gritty, Powerful And Well-Acted",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,2349,"['name', 'Jim', 'Carroll', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'mainstream', 'radio-friendly', 'listeners', 'who', 'know', 'rock', 'poetry', 'Punk', 'Carroll', 'one', 'genre', 'greatest', 'word-players', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'recorded', 'two', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'works', 'quot', 'Catholic', 'Boy', 'quot', 'quot', 'People', 'Who', 'Died', 'quot', 'sound', 'wonderfully', 'gritty', 'hybrids', 'beat', 'poetry', 'Punk', 'rock', 'quot', 'Basketball', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'based', 'Carroll', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'testament', 'days', 'living', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'became', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'saw', 'friends', 'die', 'spiral', 'down', 'self-destruction', 'eventually', 'found', 'talent', 'words', 'exit', 'hell', 'was', 'trapped', 'movie', 'story', 'alive', 'powerful', 'impact', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Kalvert', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'obvious', 'anti-drug', 'message', 'instead', 'story', 'Carroll', 'teen', 'years', 'simply', 'just', 'told', 'almost', 'documentary-like', 'realism', 'how', 'scenes', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'nothing', 'feels', 'false', 'instead', 'chillingly', 'real', 'Anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'environment', 'attended', 'high', 'school', 'more', 'gritty', 'violent', 'sections', 'city', 'can', 'instantly', 'relate', 'people', 'events', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'live', 'great', 'believability', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'broke', 'role', 'even', 'recent', 'work', 'films', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'quot', 'more', 'tame', 'compared', 'brilliant', 'effective', 'performance', 'here', 'scenes', 'where', 'Carroll', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'junkie', 'underworld', 'are', 'performed', 'DiCaprio', 'vivid', 'realism', 'disturbing', 'One', 'reviewer', 'here', 'complained', 'movie', 'missing', 'plot', 'plot', 'not', 'something', 'central', 'here', 'story', 'central', 'story', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'gripped', 'addiction', 'world', 'where', 'vices', 'darker', 'side', 'life', 'can', 'easily', 'suck', 'course', 'great', 'music', 'here', 'Soundgarden', 'Doors', 'Cult', 'great', 'highlight', 'Carroll', 'performing', 'quot', 'Catholic', 'Boy', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'history', 'rock', 'music', 'are', 'many', 'popular', 'stories', 'addiction', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Scott', 'Weiland', 'Carroll', 'brought', 'life', 'movie', 'breathes', ""n't"", 'need', 'throw', 'message', 'face', 'message', 'right', 'there', 'story']",Basketball Diaries VHS

380057,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,6303567126,Tristan,"[2, 3]","Jim Carroll is a basketball star. He and his gang of friends get into gang fights and steal things in their spare time. When Jim gets involved in drugs, his life slowly start to deteriorate. More and more problems arise as he continues to get fixated and goes to more horrific and depressing extremes in order to get his next fix. The film details his descent from basketball star to full-fledged junkie. Based on the diaries by writer Jim Carroll, the film was in the making for several years before finally being released to mixed reviews in the mid-90s. Being a big fan of the book, I watched this film. This is what I think of it.This film could have been great. Indeed, it isn't terrible. There is a lot to admire about this piece of work. For starters, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He displays a strong range of talent reminiscent of James Dean. His performance is definitely very memorable and extremely realistic. The soundtrack to the film is also quite top-notch and truly lends itself to the angry tone of the film. I also appreciated much of the early scenes in the film and I found many of them to have a true sense of gritty realism as well as a type of ironic detachment that you really don't see too often these days. Juliette Lewis, despite her role being very brief, does an excellent job as well and, had she gotten more to do, could have really been remembered for her role. The film also gets the look of the dank, dark, grimy streets of New York down pitch-perfect. You can really get a true feel for the atmosphere and the scum that pervades the life of Jim and of his friends. You really get a sense of the filmmaker almost being a witness to the type of depraved behavior depicted in the film.Unfortunately, the flaws outweigh the positives in this film. One of my biggest complaints has to do with the terrible decision to change the time of the story from the 80s to the mid-90s. If there were any time period this film should have been set in it should have been the 80s. The film's soundtrack consists mostly of 80s music. The idea of 80s excess was a big part of the original book and almost lent itself to a kind of realism nearly on par with Less than Zero(the novel) in terms of it's graphic depiction from a boy whose love of life and of writing was corrupted by drug addiction and peer pressure. Unfortunately, the shift from the 80s to the mid-90s not only destroys any chance of any of those themes being explored, but also turns the film into nothing more than a mid-90s cautionary drug tale. The problems with the film, unfortunately, don't even end there. Mark Wahlberg and Ernie Hudson are known for some tremendous work in the past, but their performances in this film have to be some of their worst work ever! Mark Wahlberg is painfully one-dimensional and he manages to not even be able to do THAT right! His performance comes off completely too over-the-top and forced to the point where you cringe at his line delivery! This was before Boogie Nights, so at least he has an excuse, but what was Ernie Hudson thinking??? His character comes off as the stereotypical would-be hero who has been through it all and has made something of himself. It comes off completely fake and simply too cartoonish in nature. He was very miscast in the role and he is ultimately what takes the film down even further. My absolute worst complaint, however, has to do with one particular scene. While I cannot say what goes on in this scene, I will say that the way the filmmakers depicted it was far too over-the-top and extreme in it's nature. It's one of the most notorious scenes in the film, so I'm sure you've heard of it, the infamous ""bathroom stall scene"". Yeah, the way it is handled in the film is completely gratuitous and absolutely disgusting. It is the sole reason why I refuse to outright recommend this film. Many folks will likely attack me and say ""Oh, well that's how it really happens"" or ""Oh, well you've never experienced what that Jim guy experienced so you don't know what you're talking about"". Well, perhaps that's true. Perhaps I have never been a prostitute, nor have I been a drug addict. However, that does not make the scene less graphic and explicit than it needed to be. It's an absolutely disgusting and far too grotesque scene that was completely uncalled for.As it stands, I can still appreciate the film because it does some things right. I did like the moments of humor and the little scenes that ring true about growing up and being admired by your peers. However, if you have read the book you will be seriously disappointed. The film was a bit too flawed for me to really enjoy or be intrigued by. It's a well-made film in a lot of ways, but I cannot recommend the film to fans of the book. If you are a fan of the book, you will hate this film. If you've never read it, check it out.
