1177991,A1GH9LHQFF1W1I,B001CVS6BQ,G. Klimanis,"[2, 3]","I bought the HD Moods disc to see what the Red Camera can do.  The color is very good, but the detail and shadow noise are just OK.  Yes, they are better than DVD, but I wouldn't say that they are stunning HD.  The 24p motion signature is not right for these fish.  The detail is probably limited by DOF which is not adequate for this scene.  720p60 would have been a better choice with a different camera (Sony EX1). 1080i60 are better for fish.  HD Scapes offers 1080i60, and the motion is what we would expect.1080p marketing will be our undoing over the next ten years.  Consumers will be demanding 1080p at 30 frames/second and expecting smooth motion.  For some reason, the BluRay spec includes 1080p50 but not 1080p60.  Surely, that will be corrected.Despite my negative comments, I'd recommend this fish tank for a stunning party background but not for prolonged viewing.  The lack of panning and rapid scene changes provides proper ambience that does not draw excessive attention to itself.",3,"good image color, stutter motion",1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,999,"['bought', 'HD', 'Moods', 'disc', 'see', 'what', 'Red', 'Camera', 'can', 'do', 'color', 'very', 'good', 'detail', 'shadow', 'noise', 'are', 'just', 'OK', 'Yes', 'are', 'better', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'stunning', 'HD', '24p', 'motion', 'signature', 'not', 'right', 'fish', 'detail', 'probably', 'limited', 'DOF', 'not', 'adequate', 'scene', '720p60', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'different', 'camera', 'Sony', 'EX1', '1080i60', 'are', 'better', 'fish', 'HD', 'Scapes', '1080i60', 'motion', 'what', 'would', 'expect.1080p', 'marketing', 'will', 'be', 'undoing', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'Consumers', 'will', 'be', 'demanding', '1080p', '30', 'frames/second', 'expecting', 'smooth', 'motion', 'reason', 'BluRay', 'spec', '1080p50', 'not', '1080p60', 'Surely', 'will', 'be', 'corrected.Despite', 'negative', 'comments', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fish', 'tank', 'stunning', 'party', 'background', 'not', 'prolonged', 'viewing', 'lack', 'panning', 'rapid', 'scene', 'changes', 'proper', 'ambience', 'not', 'draw', 'excessive', 'attention']",HD MOODS: AQUARIUM

Soooo I sat through the whole thing with him and guess what ? He was right .The only Clown fish that you see is on the cover. But aside from that it is Ok and somewhat sharp but seems to have a shallow depth of field. What I mean is that fish that are only a few feet behind the main action fish seem to be a little out of focus.,3,Send in the Clown--Fish,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,454,"['Well', 'Ok', 'Just', 'OK', 'My', 'Grandson', 'watched', 'thing', 'way', 'kept', 'asking', 'where', 'Clownfish', 'Nemo', 'fish', 'Soooo', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'right', '.The', 'only', 'Clown', 'fish', 'see', 'cover', 'aside', 'Ok', 'somewhat', 'sharp', 'have', 'shallow', 'depth', 'field', 'What', 'mean', 'fish', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'feet', 'main', 'action', 'fish', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'focus']",HD MOODS: AQUARIUM

1177994,A1KY25HG3D9NWB,B001CVS6BQ,"PghDrake ""PghDrake""","[0, 0]","Bought this here because it was quite inexpensive (Just over $6 and shipped free with Plus) and I needed another choice from the fireplace disc I have had for years.  I probably looked over the reviews for every aquarium or sea-related mood disc on here and for the most part they were rated either very poorly or at 4 stars or so.  I'm giving this a 4-star rating because I wasn't expecting perfection for something so inexpensive and it still came pretty close.Great looking setting and fish.  Probably from a much larger aquarium than what you're actually seeing though - you can tell this mostly from the current of the water which is pretty strong.  If it were that strong on an aquarium the size of what you see, the fish would noticeably be affected by it I'm sure.  This current, in my opinion, enhances the experience because you can see a little more movement in the scenery.  The fish are beautiful, and are not constantly on screen but they do dart around into the scenery items pretty often.  The bubbles are great, and you can turn that up or down as much as you want so it's neither too loud or too quiet.Very enjoyable experience - and although it's meant to (in my opinion) be run in the background, we found ourselves quite often being mesmerized by the fish and watching them intently from time to time.

Recorded at high level.- nice variety of fish-two tank views.  One zoomed in and fish are really big or one view with fish smaller.-can have just natural aquarium sound or music.  Thank goodness.  Listening to the same music over and over would have driven me crazy.  And during natural, hearing the bubbles is relaxing.Cons:-the fish can swim out of screen.  This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  Think if fish wouldn't be able to swim out of screen the aquarium would seem more real.  Soon as the swim out of screen view my brain says not real.-think also this is a video in the ocean.  The plants are real .  Wish it would have been fake plants more realistic of a home aquarium.But great video.
