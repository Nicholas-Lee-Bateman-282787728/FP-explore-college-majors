Billy's parents are crap - the Mom has gone to the city (selfish cow) leaving her boys with a loser drunk.  Billy gets a brief little kiss from his hunky cowboy pal, the Dad sees and then it is all on.  Bad drama here...carries on to even more implausible scenarios.  Billy gets thrown out of home.  Goes to the city, meets a cutey in his first minutes who feeds him, houses him, befriends him and wants nothing in return - yeah right.  Billy gets a job looking after a stroke victim who lives with his gay son.  And I am a bit shallow obvioulsy, the stroke victim makes me shudder and I couldn't watch him...felt repulsed.  So Billy is there to look after him he is an Angel:0)  And the bald drag queen is like a car wreck - horrible but you can't help looking with that twisted look of 'Oh my God how awful' look on your face. And how come the mother (selfish cow) isn't lambasted for child abandonment but welcomed back like the long lost saviour...child services would have had Billy and his brother in this country...where are they in cowboy country???  Soooo, the stroke victim has a son who likes BIlly and voila...the end.  No angst, no real passion play, no heart-pounding kissing scenes.  A bit disappointing in all really.  But the friend ends up with cowboy pal and Billy ends up with stoke victim's son...happy ending.  I LOVE happy endings...but this seems like champagne without the crisp bubbles, a bit flat.

1102940,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000VLLYFI,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[11, 19]","When 18 year old Billy's bible-thumping alcoholic father sees him exchange an exploratory kiss with another boy, he throws him out of their farm home.  Billy hitchhikes to Los Angeles, where he quickly makes friends and gets a job as a live-in aide for Mark, a multiple stroke victim who living with James, his gay photographer son. Billy's natural cheerful nature, honesty and willingness to help  make a difference in both men's lives.When Billy comes home from a night out at the gay clubs with a friend, and laments on how they picked on his simple nature and choice of jobs, he tells James that he fears he will never be loved.  James is quick to reinforce that both he and his father love Billy like a member of the family, but he knows that isn't what Billy necessarily means.  This moment brings to the surface the growing attraction between the two.  But, when an old boyfriend of James resurfaces, Billy fears he is being deceived.This is a sweet, highly emotional story, which surprisingly comes from Greg Osborn, a writer/director who is better known for his rather grusome horror films.  The largely inexperienced cast click well together (especially Dustin Belt in the title role), and manage to handle some rather tough emotional scenes.  Although the film lasts a full two hours, it felt unbalanced to me, with the first half of the film fully fleshed out into minute detail, while the second hour often seemd rushed and short of any significant plot points. I realize the writers were striving to concentrate on the positive aspects of the gay community in showing strangers willing to help Billy, but I think it took a turn from optimistic and veered into the ridiculous, about the time they started dancing in the hair salon. I was expecting some kind of conflict resulting from the visit of Billy's mom, and the absence of same means that visit really added nothing to the film.  The ""tying up of loose ends"" at the end also seemed a bit unrealistic.Overall, however, this is a rather original, enjoyable film, definitely worth seeing.  DVD extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, bloopers, writer/director interview, and a (somewhat overdone) tour of his home, where most of the film was shot.  I give the film four stars out of five.",4,"Sweet, well-acted emotional tale of love and belonging.",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,2278,"['When', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Billy', 'bible-thumping', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'exchange', 'exploratory', 'kiss', 'boy', 'farm', 'home', 'Billy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'quickly', 'friends', 'job', 'live-in', 'aide', 'Mark', 'multiple', 'stroke', 'victim', 'who', 'living', 'James', 'gay', 'photographer', 'son', 'Billy', 'natural', 'cheerful', 'nature', 'honesty', 'willingness', 'help', 'make', 'difference', 'men', 'lives.When', 'Billy', 'home', 'night', 'out', 'gay', 'clubs', 'friend', 'laments', 'how', 'picked', 'simple', 'nature', 'choice', 'jobs', 'James', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'loved', 'James', 'quick', 'reinforce', 'father', 'love', 'Billy', 'member', 'family', ""n't"", 'what', 'Billy', 'necessarily', 'moment', 'surface', 'growing', 'attraction', 'two', 'when', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'James', 'resurfaces', 'Billy', 'being', 'deceived.This', 'sweet', 'highly', 'emotional', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'Greg', 'Osborn', 'writer/director', 'who', 'better', 'known', 'rather', 'grusome', 'horror', 'films', 'largely', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'click', 'well', 'together', 'especially', 'Dustin', 'Belt', 'title', 'role', 'manage', 'handle', 'rather', 'tough', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'film', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'felt', 'unbalanced', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'minute', 'detail', 'second', 'hour', 'often', 'rushed', 'short', 'significant', 'plot', 'points', 'realize', 'writers', 'were', 'striving', 'concentrate', 'positive', 'aspects', 'gay', 'community', 'showing', 'strangers', 'willing', 'help', 'Billy', 'think', 'took', 'turn', 'optimistic', 'veered', 'ridiculous', 'time', 'started', 'dancing', 'hair', 'salon', 'was', 'expecting', 'kind', 'conflict', 'resulting', 'visit', 'Billy', 'mom', 'absence', 'same', 'means', 'visit', 'really', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'end', 'also', 'seemed', 'bit', 'unrealistic.Overall', 'however', 'rather', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'writer/director', 'interview', 'somewhat', 'overdone', 'tour', 'home', 'where', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'five']",An Angel Named Billy

1102947,A14794N044AML4,B000VLLYFI,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[4, 5]","The acting doesn't live up to it's standard. Even though the movie is making a political statement about being gay, the drag queen is terrible, Billy is mediocre at best, James and Guy are average. And the lady who owns the coffee shop is another representation of these women who try to engulf the gay cause all of by themselves (remember Debbie from ""Queer as Folks"".)The story is about Billy who gets caught kissing with his best friend (a beautiful cowboy looking hunk, the guy on the movie box) in the beginning of the movie and gets booted out his farm ranch from a very abusive, alcoholic father (who has a bible next to him.) Billy hitchhikes to Los Angeles. There he meets Guy, a cute bus boy in a coffee shop. Guy offers his place to Billy temporarily. They show a scene of these two beautiful gay kids next to each other sleeping, nothing happens between them, com on give me a break.Billy gets hired by James (a much older guy than Billy), the son of Mark, who had several strokes. James is a professional photographer, who just came out a relationship with a drug addict. Mark and his friend Tom, a drag queen go way back together. The setting up of the plot with these two characters was endless in the beginning of the movie.Billy moves in with Mark and Mark becomes very fond of Billy as a caretaker. James also starts falling for Billy, and vice versa. Marks finally dies from his illness. Billy and James get married. Guy moves back to where Billy is from and hooks up with Billy's best friend. And yes, Billy gets re-acquainted with his mother who has been living in LA since she left her drunk husband.The movie has its' moments, and it is a cute love story. Billy and Guy are gorgeous. I do not understand why this movie is so pricey, after all it is an American movie. Again the acting is bad. And this movie almost has an identical plot to another American movie ""The Journey of Jared Price."" In this movie Jared goes for the young kid which he met when he first arrived at LA (unlike Billy), instead of the older guy.",3,"Nice Story, But",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2041,"['acting', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'standard', 'Even', 'movie', 'making', 'political', 'statement', 'being', 'gay', 'drag', 'queen', 'terrible', 'Billy', 'mediocre', 'best', 'James', 'Guy', 'are', 'average', 'lady', 'who', 'coffee', 'shop', 'representation', 'women', 'who', 'try', 'engulf', 'gay', 'cause', 'remember', 'Debbie', 'Queer', 'Folks', 'story', 'Billy', 'who', 'caught', 'kissing', 'best', 'friend', 'beautiful', 'cowboy', 'looking', 'hunk', 'guy', 'movie', 'box', 'beginning', 'movie', 'booted', 'out', 'farm', 'ranch', 'very', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'who', 'bible', 'next', 'Billy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Guy', 'cute', 'bus', 'boy', 'coffee', 'shop', 'Guy', 'place', 'Billy', 'temporarily', 'show', 'scene', 'two', 'beautiful', 'gay', 'kids', 'other', 'sleeping', 'nothing', 'happens', 'com', 'give', 'break.Billy', 'hired', 'James', 'much', 'older', 'guy', 'Billy', 'son', 'Mark', 'who', 'had', 'several', 'strokes', 'James', 'professional', 'photographer', 'who', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'relationship', 'drug', 'addict', 'Mark', 'friend', 'Tom', 'drag', 'queen', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'together', 'setting', 'up', 'plot', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'endless', 'beginning', 'movie.Billy', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'very', 'fond', 'Billy', 'caretaker', 'James', 'also', 'falling', 'Billy', 'vice', 'versa', 'Marks', 'finally', 'illness', 'Billy', 'James', 'get', 'married', 'Guy', 'back', 'where', 'Billy', 'hooks', 'up', 'Billy', 'best', 'friend', 'yes', 'Billy', 're-acquainted', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'LA', 'left', 'drunk', 'husband.The', 'movie', 'moments', 'cute', 'love', 'story', 'Billy', 'Guy', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'pricey', 'American', 'movie', 'Again', 'acting', 'bad', 'movie', 'almost', 'identical', 'plot', 'American', 'movie', 'Journey', 'Jared', 'Price', 'movie', 'Jared', 'young', 'kid', 'met', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'LA', 'Billy', 'instead', 'older', 'guy']",An Angel Named Billy
1102948,A24QWF6BOMLOAZ,B000VLLYFI,"R.S.G ""lopakaboy""","[3, 4]","An angel named Billy. Just seen it on HERE! tonight and I have to say that this movie was a bit raw in dialog.  Acting is pretty good but I do have to say this movie has a tendency to drag in certain areas and not clear in other areas.  I decided to buy this movie because of the content though.  I felt that this movie needs a tweak or to, but a honest attempt to make a romantic love story and that is why I decided to give it 4 stars.The beginning goes by very fast.  Alcoholic father finds his son kissing a gorgeous boy next door.  Father is a so called ""Christian"" with strong beliefs.  But in his drunken rage, kicks is son out of the house.So Billy ventures to Los Angels where he meets makes a friend.  He then finds a ad on a bulletin for a live-in caretaker.  In character of Billy is honest, caring young man, quite new ""NEWBY"" who decides to take the care taking job.  When all that said and done, the man who hires Billy to caretake his ailing father turns into his lover.  Basic story in a nut shell.Storyline had potential but my opinion; not either played or executed correctly I feel.  Actors a fairly good for the dialog they have.I am old romantic so I decided to add this to my gay romance collection.  The actors are hot so why not? LoL  but in the end, I guess what caught me was the message they tried to send out.  Its jumpy in the movie, like they have many thoughts and go in several different directions that made me wonder while watching, what direction are they going.  If you like a romance, this story is ok.  If your looking for more than that, this movie would probably bore you.  I recommend watching it on ""LOGO"" or ""HERE!"" networks(s) first before buying it.For me though, its a good romantic movie.",4,Ok story line...

1102949,AAOX84JTDCETN,B000VLLYFI,Siskell and Eggbert,"[13, 16]","The acting, dialogue, directing, set production.....everything about this movie was just horrible.  So let's just focus on it's biggest flaw, the complete lack of believability of this movie's storyline.1) Billy is spotted kissing his best friend and is kicked out of his house by his crazy cliche bible-thumpin' father. Where does Billy go?? To live with his divorced mother, to find his best friend and cry on his shoulder?? Nope. He decides to hitch a ride to L.A. with only $40 and a backpack (which magically contains at least four or five changes of clothes.)2)We spend a good 15 minutes with a phone conversation between the ugliest and most cliche drag queen in the world and a guy who's had a few strokes. Maybe I shouldn't laugh at a stroke victim, but it's so obvious his lips are literally glued together to pull off the stroke-face affect. The stroke victim's son is about 40 years old, but apparently the actor playing him hasn't been told this.  He plays it like he's 16 with much batting of the eyelashes, over-emoting and naivete. Stroke dad wants son to find a good man. Creepy son decides to hire a ""house boy"" to take care of stroke dad.3) Upon arriving in L.A. Billy goes to a small cafe (which appears to also double as the courtyard of stroke dad's home.) He orders only a soda. The bitchy queen waiter, Guy, says, ""Sure honey...coming right up."" LOL. Yeah, that's a pretty typical response in L.A. He brings the drink and then says ""let's go get burgers."" The cliche hag whips up the burgers and fries in 20 seconds flat.  They chat using horrible dialogue for about a minute, Guy eating only a few fries and Billy eating nothing.  Flamy Guy doesn't know a thing about Billy but asks him to move in with him.  Back at Guy's apartment which also appears to be just a room in stroke dad's house with a ""1A"" number stuck on it, Billy asks to take a shower.  It literally takes him 15 seconds.  They lie in bed shirtless (and it's probably only about 6 or 7 p.m.) and just go to sleep.  Guess the writer, director, producer, idiot didn't have any dialogue or plot ideas.4) Billy calls creepy son about the ""house boy"" position and then interviews with stroke dad and creepy son. Of course just prior to the interview, Guy and Billy have a ridiculous musical dance scene where they go to get Billy's hair cut.  The actor playing Billy must have said he wasn't getting paid enough to get his locks clipped because his hair doesn't change one bit.  At stroke dad's house, creepy son does everything but dry hump Billy. They ask nothing about his background, ask for no references and say ""You sound perfect!!"" So does a serial killer.5) Creepy son continues stalking Billy to the point of creating uncomfortable scenes for the viewer.  Isn't it perfectly normal for a 40 year old gay man to ply his father's 17-18 year old care-taker with margaritas and leer at the boy as he lies in his underwear in bed?  Billy appears to have no attraction to creepy son until he comes back from a night out with Guy and his friends crying.  Those awful, catty queens were mean enough to call him a ""cute nurse.""  The nerve!!  Creepy son makes his move and does dry hump Billy.  Two seconds later, after saying they love each other, creepy son goes in for the full molest.  The next morning they tell stroke dad about their love.  Stroke dad says, ""I know...I heard you last night"", conjuring up images of stroke dad giving his non-stroke hand a good workout the night before.6) Billy's awful mother comes to L.A. to spend the day with her son. They shop all day and then return to her hotel room where she nonchalantly tells Billy, over cookies and milk, that his stupid father died a few days after Billy left.  Billy's little brother is now living with an aunt, but she hopes to get custody soon.  The mother character is as horrible as the lady portraying her.7) Stroke dad dies, crazy rodeo clown drag queen cries.  A lot is said about friends to the end, friends forever, friends don't let queens look like that on camera, etc.  I'm not quite sure since I spent the entire scene with a bag over my head.  Clowns are scary!8) After some silly melodrama regarding a kiss that wasn't, Billy and creepy son profess their eternal and creepy love.  It's hard to tell if Billy is crying because he does or doesn't want to kiss creepy son.  The chemistry is pulsating....or is that creepy son's eyelashes again?9) The train wreck ends as crazy director wraps up movie by trying to connect everyone.  Awful mother and braindead Bozo the drag queen start up a gay dating service.  Guy inherits a country home and starts dating Billy's old best friend.  Creepy son and Billy ride off in a limo drinking more margaritas.  Creepy son dumps Billy when he turns 19 for being too old for him.  Says he's looking for more of a Zack Ephron type...circa 2004.  What....that didn't happen???  Well there's always room for a sequel....hint hint Greg Osborne.",1,Was the director trying to make a comedy??,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,4946,"['acting', 'dialogue', 'directing', 'set',
