713225,A1T9CYRI08HZ9S,B00006FDBP,Bobby Dillard,"[2, 2]","This is one of the worst zombie films ever made.  The acting is amateurish, the special effects are weak, the same camera shots are recycled again and again, etc.  The plot centers around a research station's staff who are massacred by the living dead (who, by the way, look like ninjas) conjured up by an upset medicine man.  The one survivor is a little girl who grows up and (surprise, surprise) ends up back on the island with a motley group of friends who end up fighting the living dead still roaming the place.  After arrival on the island, one of the most laughable parts of the film happens.  The island is supposedly out in the remote Pacific but yet the main characters arrive on a small motorboat.  Furthermore, the viewer is asked to believe that the three men who are supposedly mercenaries (two I could believe but one looked like the lead singer for a synthpop band) have girlfriends who look like they stepped out of a 1980's mall.  In another laughable scene, the people need help for their boat but, when one of the men sees someone (it turns out to be on the living dead) in the vegetation, he doesn't yell, &quot;Stop, PLEASE!  We need help!&quot;  No, he decides to pursue the zombie who inexplicably runs away and then BEATS the zombie with his fists.  That's not a good way to get help.If you want a good zombie film, get Dawn of the Dead.",1,Weak Entry into the Zombie Genre,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,1363,"['one', 'worst', 'zombie', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'weak', 'same', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'recycled', 'again', 'again', 'etc', 'plot', 'centers', 'research', 'station', 'staff', 'who', 'are', 'massacred', 'living', 'dead', 'who', 'way', 'look', 'ninjas', 'conjured', 'up', 'upset', 'medicine', 'man', 'one', 'survivor', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'up', 'back', 'island', 'motley', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'living', 'dead', 'still', 'roaming', 'place', 'arrival', 'island', 'one', 'most', 'laughable', 'parts', 'film', 'island', 'supposedly', 'out', 'remote', 'Pacific', 'yet', 'main', 'characters', 'arrive', 'small', 'motorboat', 'Furthermore', 'viewer', 'asked', 'believe', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'supposedly', 'mercenaries', 'two', 'could', 'believe', 'one', 'looked', 'lead', 'singer', 'synthpop', 'band', 'have', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'look', 'stepped', '1980', 'mall', 'laughable', 'scene', 'people', 'need', 'help', 'boat', 'when', 'one', 'men', 'someone', 'out', 'be', 'living', 'dead', 'vegetation', ""n't"", 'yell', 'quot', 'Stop', 'PLEASE', 'need', 'help', 'quot', 'No', 'pursue', 'zombie', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'away', 'then', 'BEATS', 'zombie', 'fists', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'help.If', 'want', 'good', 'zombie', 'film', 'get', 'Dawn', 'Dead']",N/A

713227,AP1RICQOPPTQ1,B00006FDBP,C.,"[0, 0]","&#34;Zombie 4: After Death&#34; aka just &#34;After Death&#34; is the third (you read that right, 3rd) installment in the &#34;Zombi&#34; quadrilogy, technically making it the 'true' &#34;Zombie 3.&#34; It follows 1980's &#34;Zombi 2&#34; (&#34;Zombie&#34;) and 1988's &#34;Zombi 3&#34; (&#34;Zombie 2&#34;). Technically speaking, this is the last 'true' installment in the series that began with Lucio Fulci's &#34;Zombie.&#34; It was written by the previous installment's head writer, but as Fulci had long since fallen into poor health, the director's chair for this film was handed over to a Claudio Fragasso (credited as &#34;Clyde Anderson&#34; for unknown reasons) who is best known for directing the widely proclaimed &#34;Worst Movie of All Time&#34; known only as the loveably loathed &#34;Troll 2.&#34; He was also an assistant director on the previous installment in the series, which, aside from a few other assistants and a single actor in this movie (the head doctor/scientist from &#34;Zombi 3&#34; playing a different role, here) are the only connections this has to the other two 'Zombie' movies.The movie starts out with a brief narration stating that a group of scientists and doctors establish a setup on a remote, tropical island where they aim to find a cure for &#34;mankind's oldest and greatest enemy: death itself.&#34; We're then treated a to ridiculous 80s power ballad over the opening credits that you suddenly realize is going to be the main theme of the entire movie (think like how there's an instrumental version the Duran Duran James Bond theme song from that plays as the score throughout the entirety of &#34;A View to a Kill.&#34;). After that we're treated an extended flashback that sets up the movie's basic, albeit loosely tied together premise: a young woman whose parents are murdered by undead cultists and zombies brought about by an unholy mix of modern science, medicine, religion and ancient voodoo black magic, this young woman escapes the island as a little girl and comes down with an extremely convenient case of partial amnesia which she only reveals at a point where it's far beyond helping anyone's situation because she returns to the island twenty years later with a group of... misfits, is the only way I know how to put it.That's right, she's on a boat with your most garden variety of scary movie victim archetypes: the 'Murican guy who likes guns, beer and scantily clad women and talks with a southern accent, a shy, sort of reserved bookish girl who dresses a little more conservatively than most women (but deep down she's not too conservative) and a black guy. Their boat breaks down when they hear spooky sounds coming from a nearby island. Unaware to them, there's also three other people on the island. Researchers who've been sent by the 'Academy' to try and figure out what went wrong twenty years ago (one of them is played by the head scientist from &#34;Zombi 3&#34; as I already said). As I told you, there's three of these 'researchers.' The two soon to be dead ones who are way too curious and should stop poking their noses into the gaping mouth of hell and the pretty boy who survives and is destined to become romantically or at least almost romantically entangled with the girl who survived the island as a toddler. The researchers find the &#34;Book of the Dead.&#34; No really. There's literally a book with the English words: &#34;The Book of Death&#34; on its cover, written in what looks like electrical tape on a large white bible's cover. They keep referring to it as the &#34;Book of the Dead&#34; but curiously, its title, as read literally (in English, mind you) says &#34;The Book of Death.&#34; Whatever. The one scientist reads from it, opens the door to Hell and chaos ensues. If you want to know more, go watch the movie, I'm just here to review it, not write an entire synopsis.From a technical standpoint, the movie is quite good. It's largely Italian talent, which is always fun, because they're all speaking English phonetically and some bad voice actors were called in to dub over it at the last minute for its brief theatrical release in the States. But the zombies in this movie are quite versatile. They're flesh eaters, yes, but they also seem to be operating on a hierarchy controlled by some sort of hive mind, like the Borg from &#34;Star Trek.&#34; They shamble slowly at times, but only some of them, and it's usually the ones who've been in the ground for decades. Fresher zombies are far more intelligent, some can even talk. At least two of them are smart enough to use automatic rifles-- which, when you watch it is really fun to see. It's like &#34;Day of the Dead&#34; but with running, talking zombies. There's an unusual amount of slow-motion, and I know that this seems apophenical to say, but I really think that since this movie is &#34;Dawn of the Dead Part 4&#34; in Italy, and since Zack Snyder directed the remake of the original &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; that Snyder was watching a lot of zombie movies (and other action/sci-fi movies in general) to put him in a mindset that told him to use as much slow-motion as possible not only in his adaptation of &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; but in almost all of the movies he's done. Cinematography is excellent in this film, for the most part, and for a film of as low budget caliber as this. It's clear that this movie was under production as soon as &#34;Zombi 3&#34; wrapped, possibly even before that, but it was made in a hurry, but it was also made with love. Notice I said &#34;love.&#34; Not &#34;care.&#34;Writing-wise and editing wise, the movie is a mess. The editing is choppy, the writing is very incoherent and difficult (but not impossible) to follow. There are scenes that seem out of place or out of order, continuity errors are so abundant that if you're going to try to keep count, you'll lose count very quickly. That said, it has a very strong opening with some excellent visual effects that I have this gnawing feeling ate most of their budget. As for the writing, the characters are all pretty stereotypical, the only characters I really liked died in the first scene and were never expanded upon (the voodoo high priest and the unnamed mother of the main character spring to mind) although they seem to have not been too utterly concerned with the story as much as they were with throwing money at special effects. The gore in this movie, for an 80s movie, is top notch. There's a scene where someone gets their face torn off and I don't usually wince at that kind of stuff because (A. I've seen worse and (B. I love watching it, but it came at such a weird surprise that I didn't see it coming and I was like &#34;whoa, look at THAT! They tore her freakin' face off, man!&#34; That and the vomit effects, this movie is BIG into its vomit effects, and they're effective, to say the least because there must have been several dozen gallons of the fake vomit on hand because virtually every zombie either spits it or chokes on it or just pukes all over the place. It's like a Troma movie in that way. However, I've seen a lot of reviewers say that the movie is entertaining for the wrong reason in that it's unintentionally funny-- I didn't find it unintentionally funny or intentionally funny, I thought it was a very decent, solid, low budget yet over the top Italian horror/action movie. That's all I expected it to be, that's all I wanted it to be and for that, I award the movie a five star rating.The DVD itself is gorgeous, as is the case with all of Shriek Show's releases of the &#34;Zombie Quadrilogy,&#34; the extras are unexpectedly packed for such an obscure film including trailers, trivia and interviews with a few of the movie's stars and crew. The artwork on the cover is gorgeous, too, and it comes in a solid case. If I were going to look for deeper meaning in the movie, I'd say it's an anti-gun movie, that the zombies biting people and infecting them represent the way gun violence can be infectious in real life, since some of the zombies in the movie are gun-toting and some of the characters are over the top American (or in this case, 'Murican) Southern state stereotypes. The one actor who defines that role (and you'll know which one I'm talking about when you watch it) does one of the best zombie/insanity faces ever in a horror movie, I'd rank it up there with Jack Nicholson's stare in &#34;The Shining.&#34; Overall, I really liked the movie, and I think it's a fine example of Italian horror. It's just a fun film to pop in on a rainy day.So, all that said, &#34;Zombie 4: After Death,&#34; or just &#34;Zombie 3&#34; as is its 'true' title, is a fun movie if you're into schlocky, cheesy 80s movies. It's cheap, so pick it up if you see it and you're a fan of the genre, there's really no reason to not have this one in your collection if you have &#34;Zombi 2&#34; and &#34;Zombi 3&#34; in your collection. The next movie in the series, &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds&#34; (or, just &#34;Zombie 4&#34;) isn't a 'true' sequel in the way this is, as it was made prior to the release of both &#34;Zombi 3&#34; and &#34;Zombie 4: After Death,&#34; and it was later labeled a &#34;Zombi&#34; film in order to capitalize on the success of the initial three. But that's whole different review for another time. Long story short, &#34;Zombie 4: After Death&#34; is fun, gory and spooky, badly made in some aspects, brilliantly made in other aspects and if you see it, you should absolutely buy it and watch it and put it proudly on display with your horror movie collection!",5,Unusually good for a film of its kind...,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,9591,"['34', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', '34', 'aka', 'just',

713228,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00006FDBP,Crazy Jim,"[1, 2]","Italian horror films can often be like the old Hong Kong martial arts flicks where some of them are so much the same that it is nearly impossible for anyone but die-hard genre fans to tell the difference. Such is the case with ZOMBIE 4 which is not really a sequel but pretty much an entire new film.A vengeful voodoo priest puts a curse on an island causing the gates of hell to open up. Despite its title, the demonic creatures seem more like &quot;demons&quot; than &quot;zombies&quot;. In any case, this movie is equal parts Italian zombie flick and second-rate mercernary thriller. The dialouge is awful, the action scenes are very poorly-choreographed, the music is as cheesy as it gets, and the gore effects depend more on blood than any actual make-up.The walking dead in this film are a problem of their own. Most of them look like undead monks or bad Star Wars characters or something. They seem to switch back and forth from being slow-moving to jumping around like extras on a &quot;Lord Of The Dance&quot; performance. This movie takes a lot of liberties with the traditional zombie movie rules. Director Claudio Fragasso has them talking, firing guns, and doing the aforementioned leaping around. Needless to say, the action of the humans is so predictable, it's nearly irriating. There are so many groups of people that it is hard to figure out who is doing what and where.Fragasso's direction doesn't help this little flick either. What could have made for a tense moment in which a little girl runs for her life while her parents stay behind to be devoured is about as boring as anyone could have made it. The audience is supposed to understand that twenty years have gone by in between scenes without even being told. I guess the corny rock n' roll theme was our warning. And again, I can't say enough about the zombies. They honestly come off more like actors with down syndrome walking around in bad horror make-up than as scary walking corpses. The more gruesome make-up is saved for the ending which is underwhelming in itself. Claudio Fragasso is definetly no George Romero or even Lucio Fulci.

713229,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00006FDBP,Dave. K,"[2, 2]","By this time the Italian horror film industry was on a major decline and Zombie 4: After Death was one of the very worst from the late 80s. Obviously we are watching this movie to see a so bad it's good movie. Well you sort of get that, but for the most part you simply get a bad film, while there are some moments that are so bad they are fun they are few and far between. Zombie 4: After Death is billed as a sequel to Fulci's Zombie AKA Zombie 2 and Zombie 3. But I think the Zombie 4 title was just thrown on for a marketing ploy.When you have Claudio Fragasso as the director you should know what to expect. He is what would be labeled as a hack. Granted he never had much of a budget, but in the horror genre does that really matter? There are filmmakers out there who aren't good storytellers, but can put together a well made movie. Sometimes it's the luxury of a budget. But in the horror genre, some of the very best were made on low budgets. And they were very well made. You could give Fragasso 100-million dollars and his movies would still look poor.The script by Rossella Drudi is lousy, but has she ever written a good screenplay? The script is just really poor and not in a good way where it's fun. The characters are total idiots and often do the most idiotic things. Sometimes that is part of the fun, but not here. It's kind of funny, Claudio Fragasso is best known for working with the late Bruno Mettei. Who in his own right was also a bad filmmaker, it was a match made in bad movie heaven. And Rossella Drudi is actually the wife of Claudio Fragasso. Kind of fitting they would marry each other isn't it?Director Claudio Fragasso (under the name Clyde Anderson) fails at pretty much every turn. It's obvious he had no passion for this project and it very much shows. There are moments when Fragasso attempts some suspense and scares, but they don't work very well. Bottom line is Fragasso isn't a good filmmaker. He lacks any storytelling skills and his movies are also poorly made. But he does have his fans; he's one of those guys that can craft a so bad its good movie. Though for me, his movies are just often just bad.The zombies look and move terrible. They range from fast moving to really slow, some talk and some don't. Seems like Fragasso couldn't make up his mind on what he wanted to do. Actually the zombies aren't very zombie like. They at times come out more demonic, think Evil Dead and others seem more like humans infected with some kind of disease now think George A. Romero's The Crazies.I understand the budget was low, but horror fans should realize that a budget in the horror genre doesn't mean much. Again most of the all time greats were done on very low budgets. The production values are really poor. Zombie 4: After Death is simply a hack job.One of the main reasons to watch this is for the gore, but the gore is actually tame and when there is gore it's not very well done. The make up F/X were done by Franco Di Girolamo and I was rather un-impressed. He has done some solid work in the past, but he has also done some very poor work as well and here outside of maybe 2 or 3 gore scenes they look really poor. Franco Di Girolamo seems to be very hit or miss and here he was pretty much always missing. The gore was really weak.While, After Death does have some fun moments in how bad the movie is for the most part it's just bad and quite boring. The fun moments are few and far between. I'm a big fan of zombie movies and even some of the very worst I can sometimes enjoy. But I found very little to enjoy with After Death. This isn't the worst zombie movie I've ever seen, but it rates as one of them.I understand the appeal After Death has, but for me it was mostly just a badly made movie with very little good going for it. There were just times when nothing was happening and even the terrible dialogue can't make up for it. After Death is gonna be hit or miss. You'll either think it's so bad it's good. Or you'll just think it's so bad it's just terrible. Overall Zombie 4: After Death just didn't do anything for me. While it does have it's fun moments just not enough.If you must buy this movie I suggest the Zombie Pack. You get 3-movies for the price of one.",2,Claudio Fragasso could give Uwe Boll a run for worst director,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,4226,"['time', 'Italian', 'horror', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'major', 'decline', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'worst', 'late', '80s', 'Obviously', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'sort', 'get', 'most', 'part', 'simply', 'get', 'bad', 'film', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'fun', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'billed', 'sequel', 'Fulci', 'Zombie', 'AKA', 'Zombie', '2', 'Zombie', '3', 'think', 'Zombie', '4', 'title', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'marketing', 'ploy.When', 'have', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'director', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'hack', 'Granted', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'budget', 'horror', 'genre', 'really', 'matter', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'storytellers', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'luxury', 'budget', 'horror', 'genre', 'very', 'best', 'were', 'made', 'low', 'budgets', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'could', 'give', 'Fragasso', '100-million', 'dollars', 'movies', 'would', 'still', 'look', 'poor.The', 'script', 'Rossella', 'Drudi', 'lousy', 'ever', 'written', 'good', 'screenplay', 'script', 'just', 'really', 'poor', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'where', 'fun', 'characters', 'are', 'total', 'idiots', 'often', 'do', 'most', 'idiotic', 'things', 'Sometimes', 'part', 'fun', 'not', 'here', 'kind', 'funny', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'best', 'known', 'working', 'late', 'Bruno', 'Mettei', 'Who', 'own', 'right', 'was', 'also', 'bad', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'match', 'made', 'bad', 'movie', 'heaven', 'Rossella', 'Drudi', 'actually', 'wife', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'Kind', 'fitting', 'would', 'marry', 'other', ""n't"", 'Director', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'name', 'Clyde', 'Anderson', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn', 'obvious', 'had', 'passion', 'project', 'very', 'much', 'shows', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Fragasso', 'suspense', 'scares', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Fragasso', ""n't"", 'good', 'filmmaker', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'poorly', 'made', 'have', 'fans', 'one', 'guys', 'can', 'craft', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'often', 'just', 'bad.The', 'zombies', 'look', 'move', 'terrible', 'range', 'fast', 'moving', 'really', 'slow', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'Seems', 'Fragasso', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'Actually', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'zombie', 'times', 'come', 'out', 'more', 'demonic', 'think', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'others', 'seem', 'more', 'humans', 'infected', 'kind', 'disease', 'now', 'think', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'Crazies.I', 'understand', 'budget', 'was', 'low', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'realize', 'budget', 'horror', 'genre', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'Again', 'most', 'time', 'greats', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'low', 'budgets', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'really', 'poor', '4', 'Death', 'simply', 'hack', 'job.One', 'main', 'reasons', 'watch', 'gore', 'gore', 'actually', 'tame', 'when', 'gore', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'make', 'up', 'F/X', 'were', 'done', 'Franco', 'Di', 'Girolamo', 'was', 'rather', 'un-impressed', 'done', 'solid', 'work', 'past', 'also', 'done', 'very', 'poor', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'maybe', '2', '3', 'gore', 'scenes', 'look', 'really', 'poor', 'Franco', 'Di', 'Girolamo', 'be', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'here', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'missing', 'gore', 'was', 'really', 'weak.While', 'Death', 'have', 'fun', 'moments', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'bad', 'quite', 'boring', 'fun', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'zombie', 'movies', 'even', 'very', 'worst', 'can', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'enjoy', 'Death', ""n't"", 'worst', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'rates', 'one', 'them.I', 'understand', 'appeal', 'Death', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'badly', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'good', 'going', 'were', 'just', 'times', 'when', 'nothing', 'was', 'happening', 'even', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'Death', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', ""'ll"", 'either', 'think', 'so', 'bad', 'good', ""'ll"", 'just', 'think', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'terrible', 'Overall', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'have', 'fun', 'moments', 'just', 'not', 'enough.If', 'must', 'buy', 'movie', 'suggest', 'Zombie', 'Pack', 'get', '3-movies', 'price', 'one']",N/A

Despite the fact that they aren't really related, 'Zombie 4' is relatively reminiscent of 'Zombi 3', with the jungle isle setting and the emphasis on gunning down the zombies.  I actually kind like 'Zombi 3' but the action scenes in this movie are just so damn boring, to go with the weak, played out effects and lame zombies with silly false teeth that stick like 4 inches out of their faces.  And when it's trying to be tense it's just incredibly tedious.

713233,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00006FDBP,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","I've watched Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie."" I've navigated my way through George Romero's Dead Trilogy. I've seen the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. I've chortled my way through Bruno Mattei's low budget schlockfest ""Zombie 3."" I've even endured Andrea Bianchi's ""Burial Ground."" Where to go now for my zombie fix? One film to set my sights on is Claudio Fragasso's ""After Death,"" sometimes referred to as ""Zombie 4"" in order to establish (and cash in on) a contrived connection to Fulci's vastly superior ""Zombie."" By the time ""After Death"" arrived in theaters (more like straight to video), in 1988, the zombie craze had pretty much breathed its last breath. In fact, the world of Italian cinema was on its last leg as television began to eclipse the movie theater in that country. Sure, Joe D'Amato, Bruno Mattei, Fulci, Ruggero Deodato, and a few others were still cranking out exploitation crud, but the end was definitely in sight as audiences melted away. Too bad. These movies plumb the cinematic depths, for the most part, but they are vastly entertaining in their inimitable way. I've decided to bump this film up on my to review list because the utter ineptness on display here practically demands my immediate attention.""After Death"" takes place on a tropical island out in the middle of nowhere (re: the Philippines) where a group of scientists (re: bad actors) attempts to develop a medicine that cures cancer. Unfortunately for this band of nondescript westerners, a witchdoctor's child dies despite the doctors' frenzied attempts to save her. Enraged by this development, this wizard opens up the third door to Hell (!) in the hope that he can conjure up a mess of zombies to dispatch the westerners in a particularly bloody manner. As the film opens, we see this doctor chanting some mumbo jumbo in a cave while a black chick with '80s hair prances about nearby. She's obviously going to turn into a zombie, which she does after falling through a gateway that opens in the floor. Before she reappears, the westerners show up toting automatic weapons. They confront the doctor and demand that he stop his reign of terror. He refuses. One of the doctors blows the voodoo magician away. Bad move. The zombies start pouring out of the nooks and crannies, spewing green goop from their mouths as they rip the physicians to bloody shreds. Meanwhile, a husband and wife affiliated with the scientists flee through the jungle with their young daughter. The little girl escapes with a special charm before her parents die.Flash forward twenty years--we don't know this until later as the movie remains vague on critical plot points--to two groups slogging through the very same jungle in which the abovementioned activities took place. One group consists of a few military types--the toothless Rod (Nick Nicholson) and clean cut Tommy (Don Wilson) among them--along with Louise (Adrianne Joseph) and the now all grown up little girl Jenny (Candice Daly). They're tooling around the river looking for kicks when their boat dies right as they sail past zombie island. Off they go into the jungle looking for god knows what. The other group, a trio including Chuck (Chuck Peyton aka Jeff Stryker) is following up on the band of scientists. These dunderheads stumble into a weird looking cave, find what looks like a temple, and promptly unleash hordes of zombies by reading a four word incantation out of a book labeled, appropriately, ""The Book of the Dead"" in big black letters. Two of these idiots die at the hands of the undead, but Chuck escapes and ends up with the other group at the house the scientists once inhabited some twenty years before. What follows is pure gory schlock as waves of zombies rush the house while our diminishing band of heroes tries to hold them off with bullets, fire, and explosive devices.I think it's extremely telling that director Claudio Fragasso, in an interview included in the extras' section, avers with a grin and hands held over his face that ""Zombie 4"" is much worse than ""Zombie 3,"" a movie that in and of itself is considered anathema by many horror fans. That should tell you what to expect here. Metaphysically bad dialogue fused with horrific dubbing and performances so bad they make dinner theater look like a Broadway production jockey for position with low rent gore effects that occasionally rise to the level of above average. Really, nearly every aspect of ""After Death"" misfires in some cringe inducing way. Let's take the zombies, as just one example. Instead of the shambling beasties we saw in the Romero and Fulci flicks, the undead in Fragasso's effort can talk, shoot weapons, and run as fast as Olympic track stars. What's worse, most of their makeup effects are more likely to make the viewer laugh than shriek in terror. On at least one occasion I could see the edges of the latex, or whatever they used, peeling off of the actor's skin. Oops! Oh well, at least a few of the gore scenes work, such as a hand punching through a chest, a face peeling, and an eyeball gouged out of a socket. Other than that, forget about it.Extras on this Shriek Show disc include trailers for ""Eaten Alive,"" ""After Death,"" ""Zombie 3,"" and ""The House at the Edge of the Park."" Also here for your viewing pleasure are interviews with Claudio Fragasso, Jeff Stryker, and Candice Daly (she's really cute!). The liner notes and Fragasso biography looked moderately interesting but the font was so small I couldn't read them. So should you give ""After Death"" a shot? Only if you love schlock films or are a hardcore zombie aficionado. Everyone else should stay as far away from this movie as possible. Until you've acquired a taste for films like this, you could suffer permanent brain damage sitting through this sort of catastrophe.",2,Schlock filmmaking at its most banal,1122508800,"07 28,

713235,A3U5WICBZ0CUQ8,B00006FDBP,Matthew C. Pinkerton,"[3, 4]","Picked up this disc yesterday after an unexpectedly enjoyable experience with the oft-maligned ""Zombie 3.""  Truth be told, I found ""Zombie 3"" to be a highly enjoyable (if deeply flawed) film.  The direction was inconsistent as a result of the Fulci/Mattei hand-off.  A lot of the acting was passable at best and just plain painful at worst (my least favorite being the actor portraying the lead scientist, undoubtedly working under Mattei's direction).  The movie did, however, have enough creativity and just plain insane kill-em-all-and-let-god-sort-em-out energy in the script and the execution (no pun intended) to keep me going straight through to the end.  The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of this installment in the series.  While displaying a level of creativity similar to that of the previous installment also written by Claudio Fragasso, this time the whole enterprise feels conspicuously like make-believe.  The acting is uniformly awful (though that's pretty much to be expected in films like these).  The make-up effects are sometimes good, often times bad and the splatter effects feel strangely muted.  In the interview track included on the ""Zombie 4"" extras menu, Fragasso mentions the trouble he had getting the film past the Italian censors and, at one point, even claims that the producer trimmed some of the gore effects.  Fragasso, jovial and self-deprecating as ever, admits that the film as it stands is pointless and a much lesser film than ""Zombie 3"" and he is absolutely right.  If you've already seen the Romero and Fulci entries in the series, then rest assured that this film offers little to tempt you.  True, I do enjoy Fragasso's coherent zombies.  They actually make for quite a nice change of pace from the usual shambling, grunting, groaning hordes massing about.  Still, Fragasso's moments of inspiration are too little too late.  I actually have a lot of respect for ol' Claudio.  His interview track on this and the ""Zombie 3"" disc are both informative and charming.  It's also apparent from this film that he has the ability to do a lot better.  Basically, ""Zombie 4"" comes across as being exactly what Fragasso readily admits it to be: a quickie cash-in on a successful horror franchise.  While I certainly understand that even artists need to pay their bills, I really wish somebody would give this guy some money and let him make a real honest-to-god horror film.  The man obviously has talent and it's a pity that it has thus far been so woefully underappreciated.  Then again, considering how many young people sacrafice their blood, sweat, tears, and various other bodily fluids every year in the production of independent features I find it kind of difficult to lament Fragasso's situation too bitterly.  If he really wanted to I'm sure he could put together a great horror film.  As it stands, however, his interest seems to extend only so far as the next paycheck.  While this might make for decent box office it by no means assures a good viewing experience and, in the end, leaves most Italian horror films of this period feeling like hollow exercises in style and splatter.

It wouldn't have been much better in Italian, because the physical acting is laughable (and my friends and I were laughing quite a bit).

I found out one thing.  When a man is afraid he's going to die, there's nothing he wants more than a women by his side.  And I want you...""  Isn't that wonderfully wretched?!?!The basic plot of ""Zombie 4: After Death"" is that Zombies are attacking a few people trapped on an island (does that sound like ""Zombi 2"" to anyone?).  What species of Zombie is this?  Fashionable.  They wear either black cloaks or grey rags with cheese cloth on their faces.  That cheese cloth is to cover up their makeup, which looks like they stuck their faces in bowls of oatmeal.  They can sometimes talk or groan.  They are fast moving and super strong.  Well, they are fast moving unless they are all lined up to kill helpless people.  Then they walk in place for 20 minutes.  Oh, and they drool green liquid.I thought ""Zombi 3"" was bad.

As the violence and bloodshed ensue, one doctor and his wife and their five-year-old daughter try to run away.  Mom and dad get it zombie style, but not before they pass off a ""secret amulet"" to the little girl.  How the hell she escapes the island while all of the adults have become zombie munchies, no one ever explains.Flash-forward several years and the little girl is all grown up and hanging with a group of half articulate soldiers of fortune.  Oh, and for good measure, we also have a trio of scientists traipsing through the jungle, searching for why the original scientists died in the first place.  These boneheads find a voodoo spell book and proceed to read the ""great and forbidden four words of zombie power"", which makes a lot of hooded Philippino zombies push up from the ""depths"" (read: lumps in the ground) of their ""graves"" to get up and shamble around.Bad goes to worse, the soldiers get killed off one by one, become zombies, dribble copious amounts of dark green goo, and, well, you know the rest of the story...The acting gets worse by the scene, the fog gets thicker, and the plot runs out of steam.  It's the kind of silly fun where someone stumbles across a trunk full of M16s and lots of ammo, zombies stagger and moan, and then break into sudden bursts of badly choreographed Kung Fu fights, candles are mysteriously alight in caves and deserted houses all over the place, and a black hougan presides over Philippino zombies.  For folks like me, this is the cheddar for which I live.The music is the highlight of the whole affair; it has a great Goblin-esque feel to it, and adds a level to the proceedings that might have fallen flatter than usual.Thankfully, there is no commentary, as I'm sure no one would have known why he or she did any of it.--Nickolas Cook",3,Zombies lost even more brains,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,2371,"['Zombie', '4', 'DeathReview', 'Nickolas', 'CookWhat', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'mix', 'Rambo', 'style', 'soldiers', 'fortune', 'Philippine', 'zombies', 'volcano', 'full', 'green', 'lights', 'voodoo', 'candles', 'lots', 'fog', 'Hopefully', 'better', 'movie', '4', 'Death.This', 'time', 'writer', 'Zombi', '3', 'took', 'reins', 'proved', 'even', 'less', 'capable', 'Mattei', 'thing', 'possible.The', 'prologue', 'few', 'minutes', 'muddle', 'back-story', 'pissed', 'off', 'voodoo', 'priest', 'juju', 'island', 'full', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'scientists', 'who', 'wife', 'death', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'ensue', 'one', 'doctor', 'wife', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'try', 'run', 'away', 'Mom', 'dad', 'get', 'zombie', 'style', 'not', 'pass', 'off', 'secret', 'amulet', 'little', 'girl', 'How', 'hell', 'island', 'adults', 'have', 'become', 'zombie', 'munchies', 'one', 'ever', 'explains.Flash-forward', 'several', 'years', 'little', 'girl', 'grown', 'up', 'hanging', 'group', 'half', 'articulate', 'soldiers', 'fortune', 'Oh', 'good', 'measure', 'also', 'have', 'trio', 'scientists', 'traipsing', 'jungle', 'searching', 'why', 'original', 'scientists', 'died', 'first', 'place', 'boneheads', 'find', 'voodoo', 'spell', 'book', 'proceed', 'read', 'great', 'forbidden', 'four', 'words', 'zombie', 'power', 'lot', 'hooded', 'Philippino', 'zombies', 'push', 'up', 'depths', 'read', 'lumps', 'ground', 'graves', 'get', 'up', 'shamble', 'around.Bad', 'worse', 'soldiers', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'become', 'zombies', 'dribble', 'copious', 'amounts', 'dark', 'green', 'goo', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'acting', 'worse', 'scene', 'fog', 'thicker', 'plot', 'steam', 'kind', 'silly', 'fun', 'where', 'someone', 'trunk', 'full', 'M16s', 'lots', 'ammo', 'zombies', 'stagger', 'moan', 'then', 'break', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'badly', 'choreographed', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'fights', 'candles', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'alight', 'caves', 'deserted', 'houses', 'place', 'black', 'hougan', 'presides', 'Philippino', 'zombies', 'folks', 'cheddar', 'live.The', 'music', 'highlight', 'whole', 'affair', 'great', 'Goblin-esque', 'feel', 'level', 'proceedings', 'might', 'have', 'fallen', 'flatter', 'usual.Thankfully', 'commentary', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'why', 'did', 'it.', 'Nickolas', 'Cook']",N/A

She arrives with some young girl friends, and some really old Vietnam Vets (or some type of really old creepy guys). Yeah, don't feel bad, I didn't get it either. I mean, what young girl wants to hang around some drunken old men on their tropical vacation? But anyway...zombies chase 'em around, and around, trying to eat their heads, you know, the usual. But the real question is...do they escape???? Find out in Zombie 4....Recomendations: Go see Zombie 3, it's even more hilarious.Things I learned from Zombie 4: Seriously, if you are a young girl, don't go vacationing with some old men.

If any one thing can be said about Zombie 4, it is that stupidity is not only a means, but an end in and of itself.  That's what you get when you venture in the dark waters of this disastrous flick.  Perhaps the biggest problem is not the dearth of plot (or at least a logical start to finish flow of story line), but the consistency of action and mythology.  For example, almost as if to suit the scene itself, the zombies are super-fast one minute, and then rainman slow a scant moment later.  This zombie speaks, but another one merely gurgles on its own blood.  What do you do when you see a zombie with an M16 machine gun?  You certainly don't chew valuable seconds by staring it down!  And, even better, since when do zombies monologue before they put the chomp on????  The biggest casualty of this film, unfortunately, is that all of the good gory parts have been edited out.  With the exception of the climax, and the obligatory spurts of blood throughout, you really don't see much happening.  Director Fragasso himself admits (in the interview you can access in the Extras) that without the splatter, his movie is hollow-and it indeed is as hollow as the sub-nobody actors he has working this story.  The extras are ok.  There are interviews with Chuck Peyton (a gay porn star [very popular in the Philippines] who goes by the name Jeff Stryker), Candice Daly, who had absolutely nothing of substance to say whatsoever, and the director, Fragasso who seems pretty jaded about the whole experience of having helmed the last two zombie movies.  Here's to hoping for an entirely different crew for Zombie 5, if it ever happens.  Final word of advice:  the Philippines has been done to death, get out of the jungle and move to a different environment.........maybe Atlantic City??",2,And they say only a bullet to the head will do the trick . . .,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,1849,"['was', 'certainly', 'wishing', 'half-way', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Zombie', '4', 'stupidity', 'not', 'only', 'means', 'end', 'what', 'get', 'when', 'venture', 'dark', 'waters', 'disastrous', 'flick', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'not', 'dearth', 'plot', 'least', 'logical', 'start', 'finish', 'flow', 'story', 'line', 'consistency', 'action', 'mythology', 'example', 'almost', 'suit', 'scene', 'zombies', 'are', 'super-fast', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'rainman', 'slow', 'scant', 'moment', 'later', 'zombie', 'one', 'merely', 'own', 'blood', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'see', 'zombie', 'M16', 'machine', 'gun', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'chew', 'valuable', 'seconds', 'staring', 'down', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'do', 'zombies', 'monologue', 'put', 'chomp', 'biggest', 'casualty', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'good', 'gory', 'parts', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'exception', 'climax', 'obligatory', 'spurts', 'blood', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'happening', 'Director', 'Fragasso', 'interview', 'can', 'access', 'Extras', 'splatter', 'movie', 'hollow-and', 'indeed', 'as', 'hollow', 'sub-nobody', 'actors', 'working', 'story', 'extras', 'are', 'ok', 'are', 'interviews', 'Chuck', 'Peyton', 'gay', 'porn', 'star', '[', 'very', 'popular', 'Philippines', ']', 'who', 'name', 'Jeff', 'Stryker', 'Candice', 'Daly', 'who', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'substance', 'say', 'whatsoever', 'director', 'Fragasso', 'who', 'pretty', 'jaded', 'whole', 'experience', 'having', 'helmed', 'last', 'two', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Here', 'hoping', 'entirely', 'different', 'crew', 'Zombie', '5', 'ever', 'Final', 'word', 'advice', 'Philippines', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'get', 'jungle', 'move', 'different', 'environment', 'maybe', 'Atlantic', 'City']",N/A

713246,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00006FDBP,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 0]","So lets talk for a moment about Zombie 4: After Death, shall me?  I know you probably don't want to, but I'm gonna for a few minutes anyway.Good ol' Claudio Fragasso, a kind of Italian Ed Wood, directs his first zombie opus(he was a screenwriter for the Lucio Fulci/Bruno Mattei ""sequel"", Zombie 3).  Though he's been rumored to direct scenes from Bruno Mattei's films, here he gets a zombie flick to himself, and.....well, it's a Claudio Fragasso movie.  This is the guy who blessed us with Troll 2 and Monster Dog, and I'm pretty sure most folks willing to watch this movie have a fair idea of what they are getting into.Basically what we have is a group of mercenaries who end up on an island that's under a voodoo curse-that is to say it's zombie infested.  Zombie chaos ensues and the mercs fight for their lives.Fragrasso's zombies don't seem to follow any sort of rules, they seems to come from every other zombie film made.  Sometimes they shuffle, other times they run and jump.  Sometimes they're mindless, other times they think and use weapons.  Later in the film some start talking.  The first female zombie in the film looks like she belongs in Bava's Demons.  An everything but the kitchen sink kinda deal.Fragasso states in the DVD interview that this movie was just a cheap cash-in.  Well, it certainly looks that way, but then again, all his movies look that way.  Italian horror really started slipping in the late 80s, and continued trough the 90s.  Giants like Fulci, Argento and Lamberto Bava started putting out stuff that, while sometimes entertaining, was a huge step down from what they had done in the past and what we knew they were capable of. Soavi seemed to be the exception.Zombie 4: After Death(real title After Death, coz as we all know the ""Zombie 4"" was just kinda slapped on there like ""Demons 3"") was a product of this period, and looks like it.  Yes, I gave it four stars, but that's for the entertainment value I got out of it, not for the quality of the film itself, which I do realize is quite bad.  Oddly enough, I enjoy it more than Lenzi's Black Demons from around the same time period.  And I like the tropical island setting and the voodoo theme.  If you enjoyed Burial Ground, this film is enjoyable in a similar way, though it never really reaches the entertaining highs(or should I say lows) of that film.Like Leonard Maltin said of Scooby Doo 2: ""It is what it is"", that pretty much sums up Zombie 4.  If you know when it was made and who's involved, none of it should come as a surprise.  If you like watching Brad Pitt zombie movies and are curious, I'd advise you to stay away.",4,Fragasso Island,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2631,"['So', 'lets', 'talk', 'moment', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'shall', 'know', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', ""'m"", 'gon', 'few', 'minutes', 'anyway.Good', 'ol', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'kind', 'Italian', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'first', 'zombie', 'opus', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'Lucio', 'Fulci/Bruno', 'Mattei', 'sequel', 'Zombie', '3', 'been', 'rumored', 'direct', 'scenes', 'Bruno', 'Mattei', 'films', 'here', 'zombie', 'flick', '..well', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'blessed', 'Troll', '2', 'Monster', 'Dog', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'most', 'folks', 'willing', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'fair', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'into.Basically', 'what', 'have', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'island', 'voodoo', 'curse-that', 'say', 'zombie', 'infested', 'Zombie', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'mercs', 'fight', 'lives.Fragrasso', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'follow', 'sort', 'rules', 'come', 'other', 'zombie', 'film', 'made', 'Sometimes', 'shuffle', 'other', 'times', 'run', 'jump', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'mindless', 'other', 'times', 'think', 'use', 'weapons', 'Later', 'film', 'start', 'talking', 'first', 'female', 'zombie', 'film', 'Bava', 'Demons', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'kinda', 'deal.Fragasso', 'states', 'DVD', 'interview', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'cheap', 'cash-in', 'Well', 'certainly', 'way', 'then', 'again', 'movies', 'look', 'way', 'Italian', 'horror', 'really', 'started', 'slipping', 'late', '80s', 'continued', '90s', 'Giants', 'Fulci', 'Argento', 'Lamberto', 'Bava', 'started', 'putting', 'out', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'entertaining', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'down', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'past', 'what', 'knew', 'were', 'capable', 'Soavi', 'seemed', 'be', 'exception.Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'real', 'title', 'Death', 'coz', 'know', 'Zombie', '4', 'was', 'just', 'kinda', 'slapped', 'Demons', '3', 'was', 'product', 'period', 'Yes', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'entertainment', 'value', 'got', 'not', 'quality', 'film', 'do', 'realize', 'quite', 'bad', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'more', 'Lenzi', 'Black', 'Demons', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'like', 'tropical', 'island', 'setting', 'voodoo', 'theme', 'enjoyed', 'Burial', 'Ground', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'similar', 'way', 'never', 'really', 'entertaining', 'highs', 'should', 'say', 'lows', 'film.Like', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'said', 'Scooby', 'Doo', '2', 'what', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Zombie', '4', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'who', 'involved', 'none', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'like', 'watching', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'curious', ""'d"", 'advise', 'stay', 'away']",N/A
