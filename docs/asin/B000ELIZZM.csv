973944,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000ELIZZM,Austin Somlo,"[0, 10]","If I can think of the TV shows that I usually watched during the 90's, Wings easily comes to my mind, and I remember every episode well although that fact was reinforced by having seen the reruns on USA channel. To this day, I am very astounded to learn that the very first episode aired nineteen years ago. Has time moved so fast? What I liked the best about Wings is its soft comedy with low expectations as this proved to be true in the first two seasons of Wings. Right now, I am looking at DVD cover of the show and questioning why the heck Tony Shalhoub, who only appeared in one episode titled ""Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places,"" is on it when it should have been Rebecca Schull and David Schramm. The first two seasons of Wings doesn't have laugh-a-minute episodes, and there has been too much needless drama blended in. From time to time, Wings can be corny. Although I like the characters just fine, I've always hated Helen Chapel (not Chappel as shown in back of the DVD cover) and disliked Lowell Mather. I just can't stand that stupid self-conceited arrogant personality shown off by Helen, and whenever Lowell's time to say his lines, Thomas Haden Church has this quality of delivering the lines and then waiting for the audience to laugh (if they were) before he resumes. Almost all the time, he is just not a funny guy, and I wasn't all that surprised that his career tanked when he left for a short unimpressive movie career and a failed sitcom. Timothy Daly has this overt awkwardness on his face that barely blended in well through television but would have obviously failed to translate though silver screens. Having said that, it was a miracle that he survived yet I enjoyed his character nevertheless. Rebecca Schull isn't so bad herself and makes a pleasant presence on the show. The most underrated actor of Wings goes to David Schramm who portrayed his chauvinistic character perfectly well and displayed a fine talent for comedy in a dry way. The look of his face reminds me of Oliver Hardy of the Laurel and Hardy comedy team. Now for the final member of the cast, Stephen Weber, who plays Brian Hackett, in my opinion, is the reason why Wings survived out of the hole that spelled doom for any starter shows. He is so funny and spontaneous that he actually interjects a lot of energy which helped to set off a huge momentum in many of the episodes. Whenever an episode wasn't working, Wings desperately needed Brian. It is like the Kramer effect that many shows are dependent on. If it wasn't for Brian, I can't see Wings working out at all. The best episodes of Wings seasons 1 and 2 have to be ""The Puppetmaster"" and ""My Brother's Back-And There's Going to be Trouble"" with ""Love Means Never Having to Say Geronimo"" a close behind. The reasons why the three worked the best is because of Steven Weber, and there is no denying it. Many of the other episodes are more or less good and sometimes flat. There are certain few episodes that I felt to be highly insensitive and plain inappropriate for airing such as ""There's Always Room for Cello,"" ""Sports and Leisure,"" ""A Stand Up Kind of Guy,"" ""Mother Wore Stripes,"" and maybe ""All in the Family."" The ""Mother Wore Stripes"" should have not been aired at all due to its manipulative dealing with a touchy issue and its sugarcoated ending. All in all, the first two seasons Wings show promises of good solid comedy, but the identification of its genre is often too blurred, and its comedy is uneven in many episodes although it rehashes some of the old formulas used in other shows or movies. If somebody said that Wings is genius, that's a large exaggeration. It's just a good show that happens to stand the test of time well. As for the technical aspect of the DVD, there are no special features or any subtitles except for English closed captions. The picture quality is exactly of that period of time which doesn't bother me, but if it was highly reformatted, it would have been embarrassing for me to see Joe's face.",3,Good show that is funny but highly uneven,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,4004,"['can', 'think', 'TV', 'usually', 'watched', '90', 'Wings', 'easily', 'mind', 'remember', 'episode', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'reinforced', 'having', 'seen', 'reruns', 'USA', 'channel', 'day', 'am', 'very', 'astounded', 'learn', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'nineteen', 'years', 'ago', 'Has', 'time', 'moved', 'so', 'fast', 'What', 'liked', 'best', 'Wings', 'soft', 'comedy', 'low', 'expectations', 'proved', 'be', 'true', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Wings', 'Right', 'now', 'am', 'looking', 'DVD', 'cover', 'show', 'questioning', 'why', 'heck', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'who', 'only', 'appeared', 'one', 'episode', 'titled', 'Looking', 'Love', 'All', 'Wrong', 'Places', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Rebecca', 'Schull', 'David', 'Schramm', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Wings', ""n't"", 'have', 'laugh-a-minute', 'episodes', 'there', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'needless', 'drama', 'blended', 'time', 'time', 'Wings', 'can', 'be', 'corny', 'like', 'characters', 'just', 'fine', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'Helen', 'Chapel', 'not', 'Chappel', 'shown', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'disliked', 'Lowell', 'Mather', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'stupid', 'self-conceited', 'arrogant', 'personality', 'shown', 'off', 'Helen', 'whenever', 'Lowell', 'time', 'say', 'lines', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'quality', 'delivering', 'lines', 'then', 'waiting', 'audience', 'laugh', 'were', 'Almost', 'time', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'career', 'tanked', 'when', 'left', 'short', 'unimpressive', 'movie', 'career', 'failed', 'sitcom', 'Timothy', 'Daly', 'overt', 'awkwardness', 'face', 'barely', 'blended', 'well', 'television', 'would', 'have', 'obviously', 'failed', 'translate', 'silver', 'screens', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'miracle', 'survived', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'nevertheless', 'Rebecca', 'Schull', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'pleasant', 'presence', 'show', 'most', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Wings', 'David', 'Schramm', 'who', 'portrayed', 'chauvinistic', 'character', 'perfectly', 'well', 'displayed', 'fine', 'talent', 'comedy', 'dry', 'way', 'look', 'face', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'comedy', 'team', 'Now', 'final', 'member', 'cast', 'Stephen', 'Weber', 'who', 'Brian', 'Hackett', 'opinion', 'reason', 'why', 'Wings', 'survived', 'hole', 'spelled', 'doom', 'starter', 'shows', 'so', 'funny', 'spontaneous', 'actually', 'lot', 'energy', 'helped', 'set', 'off', 'huge', 'momentum', 'many', 'episodes', 'Whenever', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'Wings', 'desperately', 'needed', 'Brian', 'Kramer', 'effect', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'dependent', 'was', ""n't"", 'Brian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Wings', 'working', 'out', 'best', 'episodes', 'Wings', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'have', 'be', 'Puppetmaster', 'Brother', 'Back-And', 'Going', 'be', 'Trouble', 'Love', 'Means', 'Never', 'Having', 'Say', 'Geronimo', 'close', 'reasons', 'why', 'three', 'worked', 'best', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'denying', 'Many', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'good', 'sometimes', 'flat', 'are', 'certain', 'few', 'episodes', 'felt', 'be', 'highly', 'insensitive', 'plain', 'inappropriate', 'airing', 'such', 'Always', 'Room', 'Cello', 'Sports', 'Leisure', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Kind', 'Guy', 'Mother', 'Wore', 'Stripes', 'maybe', 'Family', 'Mother', 'Wore', 'Stripes', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'aired', 'due', 'manipulative', 'dealing', 'touchy', 'issue', 'sugarcoated', 'ending', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Wings', 'show', 'promises', 'good', 'solid', 'comedy', 'identification', 'genre', 'often', 'too', 'blurred', 'comedy', 'uneven', 'many', 'episodes', 'old', 'formulas', 'used', 'other', 'shows', 'movies', 'somebody', 'said', 'Wings', 'genius', 'large', 'exaggeration', 'just', 'good', 'show', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'well', 'technical', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'English', 'closed', 'captions', 'picture', 'quality', 'exactly', 'period', 'time', ""n't"", 'bother', 'was', 'highly', 'reformatted', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'Joe', 'face']",Wings - The Complete First and Second Seasons

This was a great show back in the day on NBC, with many memorable characters that will keep you in stitches.  The first episode I ever saw was the original airing of ""Murder She Roast"", and I still love that episode to this day.  While staying at Fay's house, Brian was watching an episode of ""Fugitives From Justice"" talking about one Florence Chambers, aka ""The Culinary Killer.""  Just as he was taking a big sip of the cocoa that Fay had prepared for him, Brian saw a computer aged photograph of the fugitive on-screen that looked just like Fay.  He froze, and at that moment Fay poked her head in the kitchen to ask Brian if he wanted some more cocoa.  He shook his head ""No"", Fay left the room and Brian then spewed the mouthful of cocoa he had been holding all over the table.  Nick at Nite was even running a commercial awhile back of great moments that featured this clip.  It was great!  That is just one great episode from the 28 that are included in this set.This box set will provide you with a lot of great entertainment.

Just as each episode of Cheers mostly took place in the Beacon Street pub, each episode of Wings takes place in Nantucket airport. Cheers maintains a friendly rivalry with Gary's Old Towne Tavern, while Sandpiper Air has a friendly rivalry with Aeromass owner Roy Biggins. And just like Cheers, the strength of Wings is built upon great writing and eccentric, well-developed characters. From the moment you hear the memorable and soothing Schubert theme song, you'll want to be transported away to this quiet island of lovable and hilarious characters...Wings centers around the lives of two brothers, Joe (Tim Daly) and Brian Hackett (Steven Weber), who run a fledgling airline on the northeast vacation island of Nantucket. The two are assisted by sarcastic stewardess Faye Cochran (Rebecca Schull) and oddball mechanic Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church). Responsible and dependable, Joe attempts to keep the struggling business afloat in the face of fierce competition from chief rival Aeromass and its seedy owner Roy Biggins (David Schramm). But compounding Joe's problems is the unreliability of his younger brother Brian who is more of a free spirit and spontaneous adventurer. The terminal lunch counter is owned by the Hackett's childhood friend Helen Chapel (Crystal Bernard), an aspiring cellist with a quick wit. Superbly written, Wings is at times nutty and absurd, but it's always funny and the characters will quickly earn a place in your heart. It's by far one of the best situation comedies of its era...The Wings (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Legacy"" in which Joe Hackett, owner of a small single-plane airline known as Sandpiper Air receives a letter from his recently deceased father. The letter calls for him to open a package in the presence of his estranged brother Brian. After jumping through a number of hoops, the two brothers realize how important they are to one another, and Brian (a pilot himself) agrees to stay in Nantucket and help Joe run the airline... Other notable episodes from season one include ""All For One and Two for Helen"" in which Joe grows jealous of what he perceives to be a romantic relationship between Helen and Brian, and ""A Terminal Christmas"" in which the gang from the Nantucket airport unexpectedly drops into Fay's house for Christmas, only to find her grieving her dead husband and preparing to spread his ashes...Below is a list of episodes included on the Wings (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Legacy) Air Date: 04-19-1990Episode 2 (Around the World in Eighty Days) Air Date: 04-26-1990Episode 3 (Return to Nantucket: Part 1) Air Date: 05-03-1990Episode 4 (Return to Nantucket: Part 2) Air Date: 05-10-1990Episode 5 (There Once was a Girl from Nantucket) Air Date: 05-17-1990Episode 6 (All for One and Two for Helen) Air Date: 05-24-1990Episode 7 (The Puppet Master) Air Date: 09-28-1990Episode 8 (The Story of Joe) Air Date: 10-05-1990Episode 9 (A Little Nightmare Music) Air Date: 10-12-1990Episode 10 (Sports and Leisure) Air Date: 10-19-1990Episode 11 (A Standup Kind of Guy) Air Date: 10-26-1990Episode 12 (It's Not the Thought, It's the Gift) Air Date: 11-09-1990Episode 13 (Hell Hath No Fury like a Policewoman Scorned) Air Date: 11-16-1990Episode 14 (High Anxiety) Air Date: 11-23-1990Episode 15 (Friends or Lovers?)

It is really the only sit-com that I can think of that I really truly enjoyed enough to watch every week.Then, with syndication in the mid to late 90's I got to watch it all over again.Well, now they have finally come to their senses and have started releasing the show on DVD. All I can say is it's about time. This was the funniest show of the 90's and it is my personal favorite sit-com of all time.It just doesn't get any better. The characters are great; Joe, the anal and overly sensitive older brother; Brian, the flyboy (literally and figuratively); Helen, the quick-witted, smart-mouthed, lifelong friend; Fay, the (somewhat disfunctional) mother figure to everyone; Roy, the competition, a pain in the butt, but still always around causing trouble; and my personal favorites, Lowell and Antonio, Lowell being the village idiot that's good with a wrench but bad with everything else, and Antonio, who appears only once in the first 2 seasons but comes back in season 3 as the Italian cabby with a heart of gold but a long-fuse and a sarcastic, cynical outlook.I LOVE THIS SHOW.

973952,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000ELIZZM,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[155, 162]","'Wings' is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, if not the greatest.  Very few shows offer as many constant laughs and endearing, heart warming stories with characters that became comedy legends.  Who can forget Joe Hackett, the patriarch of the airport family, or his brother Brian, the casanova ladies' man who always had problems in the game of love.  Then there's Helen Chappel, future wife of Joe and proprietor of the airport's snackbar, who was always pulling out hairs due to the crazy antics of her co-workers.  Then there's Roy Biggins, the sleazy, slick yet somehow still lovable manager who's constantly scheming new ways to make a buck.  Sort of like Roy's arch-nemesis, Fay Cochran is like everyone's grandmother: sweet, caring, funny with a bit of a mischevious side.  Next is Lowell Mather, the bumbling, goofy but always well-intentioned plane mechanic who consistently brought golden comedy moments.  A character that was introduced later on but who became an invaluable addition to the cast was Antonio Scarpacci, played by Tony Shalhoub who has gone on to further fame with his TV hit series entitled 'Monk'.  Antonio's subtle, slightly neurotic portrayal of an insecure immigrant brought a great deal of humor as well as heart to the show, a character who nearly everyone could empathize with.  Finally, a character who didn't enter 'Wings' until a few seasons later but added a tremendous amount to the show's comedy was Casey Davenport, actress Amy Yasbeck and widow of the late great John ritter.  She played the on again off again girlfriend of Brian Hackett, and together they shared many hilarious episodes as they failed at dating.Truly a classic sitcom, one that I personally love and never tire of, so I cannot wait to finally get my hands on this wonderful DVD collection after waiting all these years.  Here is a brief rundown of all episodes from the first two excellent seasons:Season 11.  'Legacy'- Joe and Brian Hackett reunite after a 6-year separation due to Brian stealing Joe's fiance' and end up making amends, which was their late father's dying wish.2.  'Around the World In 80 Days'- Fay helps a pilot who's attempting a world-record flight around the globe.  Helen auditons for the Cambridge Orchestra as a cellist.3.  'Return To Nantucket: Part 1'- Brian travels to reunite with his ex-wife Carol, while Joe and Helen try to stop Brian from making a big mistake.4.  'Return To Nantucket: Part 2'- Drama ensues as Brian wants to bring Carol back with him to Nantucket, despite Joe and Helen urging him not to.5.  'There Once Was A Girl From Nantucket'- Brian sets Joe up on a blind date with a girl who has a bad reputation.6.  'All For One and Two For Helen'- Brian, Joe and Helen want to go to Boston to see a Boston Celtics basketball game, but Joe's forced to cancel due to Fay and Roy arguing over the building of a new hangar.Season 27.  'The Puppet Master'- Brian plays a prank on Helen by hiring a guy to pretend to be a pilot for the purpose of Helen falling in love with the pilot, which will break her rule of never dating pilots.  Trouble ensues as Joe gets jealous.8. 'The Story of Joe'- A writer from American Flyer Magazine stops by the Nantucket airport to do a story, which Joe is very enthused about, but his enthusiasm is quickly crushed when the writer is more interested in Brian's wild adventures than in Joe's airport.9.  'A Little Nightmare Music'- The conductor of the Minneapolis Philharmonic Orchestra comes to Nantucket and Joe and Brian convince Helen to audition for the cello position.10.

Meanwhile, Brian attemps to cheer up Fay by letting her beat him in a game of tennis.  Unfortunately for Brian, word gets around of his loss and everyone gives him a hard time.  Helen confronts Roy over sex discrimination in the hiring process.21.

While staying at Fay's, Brian suspects Fay of being a murderer after seeing her doppelganger on TV.28.

Back at the airport, Fay and Roy argue over a seemingly lost passenger who does not speak English.  Fay wants to help her but Roy wants the woman to leave.The first two seasons do not have Antonio Scarpacci, unfortunately, but we can all look forward to him in the third season at which point he becomes a regular.  This is such a wonderful show and I'm glad that all its fans finally get to enjoy it on DVD!",5,'Wings' Takes Comedy To New Heights,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,7983,"[""'Wings"", 'one', 'greatest',

973954,A3GS7XVYAK31QT,B000ELIZZM,David Heeren,"[1, 2]","I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them.Wings was one of the best of them.To get an idea what a terrific situation comedy Wings was, consider this: The last two names on the show&#8217;s credit list of eight stars during its final three (of seven) seasons were Tony Shalhoub (who late starred in Monk) and the very clever and attractive Amy Yasbeck.The show was first-class all the way, from the opening musical piece by classical composer Franz Schubert to the final scene.Unlike many sitcoms, which have hardly any story lines at all, the plots of Wings always were strong, but the characters carried the show. Brothers Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly, Steven Weber), Helen Chapel Hackett (Crystal Bernard), Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church), Roy Biggins (David Schramm) and Fay Cochran (Rebecca Schull), Shalhoub and Yasbeck all delivered hilarious lines.Wings, unlike many recent sitcoms, did not resort to X-rated jokes to evoke laughs (Well, maybe there were a few R&#8217;s). This was, in my opinion, the greatest sitcom of all-time. After Wings, airports have never seemed the same.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10.

973955,AS18HUSD425L3,B000ELIZZM,DCSKL,"[6, 7]","Why is it that the better TV series have taken so much longer to be made available on DVD?  Did you ever notice that if a show is unwatchable trash, it's out on DVD in like 6 months, but quality shows like WINGS take forever? Owning this classic sitcom on DVD was worth the wait; I just hope they don't pull the same stunt that Universal has with NIGHT GALLERY by releasing (in that case) the first season and then sitting on the rest.  If they do, we'll just have to send Lowell, Fay and Carlton Blanchard (""Hey Angelo...if a monkey were to bite ya, what kind of drugs would they make you take?"")  to have a little chat with them!This DVD set contains the first 28 episodes in their original broadcast order.  The package design is attractive, the sound quality is good, but the video quality could be better.  I'm not sure if it is the DVD transfer or the way the shows were first filmed, but the picture looks a little unclear on some of the episodes.

973984,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B000ELIZZM,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[3, 3]","I'm a tail-end Baby Boomer-meaning that I was born between 1954, and 1964. My segment of the Boomers, were always over-shadowed in the media, by both our older Boomer brethren, and Gen-Xers. So, it was great to finally find a sitcom like ""Wings"", with tail-end Boomers as the main focus of the show. I could identify with these guys, since we hailed from the same generational zeitgeist, so-to-speak.The series revolved around two very different brothers, named Joe and Brian Hackett. Joe was the elder, responsible, and straight-arrow one. Brian was his younger, much more free-spirited sibling (Brian could be a real screw-up, but somehow always came out okay in the end). Because of their radically different approach to life, their conflicts were the main source of laughs for the show.The Hackett brothers ran a tiny, one-plane commuter airline, on the island of Nantucket. They were surrounded by a menagerie of other colorful characters on the show. Their lifelong friend, Helen, ran the lunch-counter at their little airline. Roy Bigguns was their ever-egocentric competitor. Roy always loved to crow that his airline, Aeromass, was bigger and better than the Hacketts' puny operation. Lowell was their ding-bat mechanic. And Faye was their receptionist/flight announcer, who was always hilariously cheerful.In later seasons of the show, Lowell left. Then Antonio, the sad-sack airport cabdriver, joined the cast. The Antonio character was only mildly funny to me. I thought Lowell was much funnier. On occasion, actress Farrah Fork appeared on the show, as Brian's no-nonsense, military pilot girlfriend, Alex. She could never tame Brian's free-spirited ways, no matter how hard she tried (and it was always fun to watch her keep trying). Helen's klutzy sister, Casey, became a regular cast member late in the series. These extra characters added their own comedic dash to the overall ensemble of the show.""Wings"" was never one of NBC's main comedy attractions, like ""Seinfeld"", or ""Cheers"" were. But for 10 seasons, it managed to generate a loyal viewer-ship. In my opinion, I think this was due to the fact that many viewers (myself included), liked to watch the Hackett brothers live-out their dreams. After all, they owned their own business, doing what they loved (flying). They had comfortable, solidly middle-class life-styles, even owning their own gorgeous house. They lived on a scenic island, far from any crime-ridden, major urban areas. All-in-all, the Hackett brothers were tail-end Boomers, who also managed to win the proverbial game-of-life. Many of us other tail-end Boomers could be inspired in our own lives, by watching the Hacketts every week on TV!",5,"Wonderfully entertaining, clever 90s sitcom.",1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2680,"[""'m"", 'tail-end', 'Baby', 'Boomer-meaning', 'was', 'born', '1954', '1964', 'segment', 'Boomers', 'were', 'always', 'over-shadowed', 'media', 'older', 'Boomer', 'brethren', 'Gen-Xers', 'So', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'find', 'sitcom', 'Wings', 'tail-end', 'Boomers', 'main', 'focus', 'show', 'could', 'identify', 'guys', 'hailed', 'same', 'generational', 'zeitgeist', 'so-to-speak.The', 'series', 'revolved', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'brothers', 'named', 'Joe', 'Brian', 'Hackett', 'Joe', 'was', 'elder', 'responsible', 'straight-arrow', 'one', 'Brian', 'was', 'younger', 'much', 'more', 'free-spirited', 'sibling', 'Brian', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'screw-up', 'somehow', 'always', 'came', 'out', 'okay', 'end', 'radically', 'different', 'approach', 'life', 'conflicts', 'were', 'main', 'source', 'laughs', 'show.The', 'Hackett', 'brothers', 'ran', 'tiny', 'one-plane', 'commuter', 'airline', 'island', 'Nantucket', 'were', 'surrounded', 'menagerie', 'other', 'colorful', 'characters', 'show', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Helen', 'ran', 'lunch-counter', 'little', 'airline', 'Roy', 'Bigguns', 'was', 'ever-egocentric', 'competitor', 'Roy', 'always', 'loved', 'crow', 'airline', 'Aeromass', 'was', 'bigger', 'better', 'Hacketts', 'puny', 'operation', 'Lowell', 'was', 'ding-bat', 'mechanic', 'Faye', 'was', 'receptionist/flight', 'announcer', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'hilariously', 'cheerful.In', 'later', 'seasons', 'show', 'Lowell', 'left', 'Then', 'Antonio', 'sad-sack', 'airport', 'cabdriver', 'joined', 'cast', 'Antonio', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'mildly', 'funny', 'thought', 'Lowell', 'was', 'much', 'funnier', 'occasion', 'actress', 'Farrah', 'Fork', 'appeared', 'show', 'Brian', 'no-nonsense', 'military', 'pilot', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'could', 'never', 'tame', 'Brian', 'free-spirited', 'ways', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'tried', 'was', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'keep', 'trying', 'Helen', 'klutzy', 'sister', 'Casey', 'became', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'late', 'series', 'extra', 'characters', 'added', 'own', 'comedic', 'dash', 'overall', 'ensemble', 'show', 'Wings', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'NBC', 'main', 'comedy', 'attractions', 'Seinfeld', 'Cheers', 'were', '10', 'seasons', 'managed', 'generate', 'loyal', 'viewer-ship', 'opinion', 'think', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'many', 'viewers', 'included', 'liked', 'watch', 'Hackett', 'brothers', 'live-out', 'dreams', 'owned', 'own', 'business', 'doing', 'what', 'loved', 'flying', 'had', 'comfortable', 'solidly', 'middle-class', 'life-styles', 'even', 'owning', 'own', 'gorgeous', 'house', 'lived', 'scenic', 'island', 'far', 'crime-ridden', 'major', 'urban', 'areas', 'All-in-all', 'Hackett', 'brothers', 'were', 'tail-end', 'Boomers', 'who', 'also', 'managed', 'win', 'proverbial', 'game-of-life', 'Many', 'other', 'tail-end', 'Boomers', 'could', 'be', 'inspired', 'own', 'lives', 'watching', 'Hacketts', 'week', 'TV']",Wings - The Complete First and Second Seasons

It grew on me and I love the characters. I love the sibling rivalry between the Hackett brothers played by Steven Weber and Tim Daly. They're fantastic and believable as brothers that they could be in real life. The supporting cast is quite excellent with Italian cab driver Antonio played by Emmy Winner Tony Shaloub for his role as Monk, Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church as the dimwitted Lowell Mathers, ER's Laura Innes played his philandering wife, Bunny Mathers before she got the ER gig, there is Crystal Bernard who plays Helen Chapel, the woman who was an overweight child and now runs the lunch counter at the airport, of course I can't forget Roy Biggins played by the underappreciated David Schramm, and I love Fay Evelyn Cochran played by the divine and wonderful Rebecca Schull. The Hackett brothers' childhood wasn't functional since their father went crazy and their mother bailed out on them as kids. Of course, they have their moments but the chemistry among the cast is what holds the show together. They genuinely care for each other onscreen and offscreen even with spoiler Roy Biggins who we get to know as a boy who suffered humiliation in his youth and grew up to be a tough owner of Aeromass airlines, the rival to the Hackett brother's airline, Sandpiper, which is just one airplane. The show also tackles issues like homosexuality when Roy's son played by Abraham Benrubi who was on ER and is now on Men in Trees comes out to his disappointment. While Roy loves his son, he just can't admit his sexual orientation. We meet Roy's ex-wife Sylvia played by Conchetta Tomei. The show was never an Emmy winner although it did get nominations nor was it a critical hit but it was a beloved show because for thirty minutes, you just wanted to be in Nantucket and I still want to be in Nantucket if given the opportunity.",5,One of my favorite shows!,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,1973,"['prefer', 'comedy', 'drama', 'why', 'prefer', 'purchasing', 'sitcoms', 'Wings', 'are', ""n't"", 'aired', 'syndication', 'local', 'stations', 'grew', 'love', 'characters', 'love', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'Hackett', 'brothers', 'played', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Tim', 'Daly', ""'re"", 'fantastic', 'believable', 'brothers', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'supporting', 'cast', 'quite', 'excellent', 'Italian', 'cab', 'driver', 'Antonio', 'played', 'Emmy', 'Winner', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'role', 'Monk', 'Oscar', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'dimwitted', 'Lowell', 'Mathers', 'ER', 'Laura', 'Innes', 'played', 'philandering', 'wife', 'Bunny', 'Mathers', 'got', 'ER', 'gig', 'Crystal', 'Bernard', 'who', 'Helen', 'Chapel', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'overweight', 'child', 'now', 'lunch', 'counter', 'airport', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Roy', 'Biggins', 'played', 'underappreciated', 'David', 'Schramm', 'love', 'Fay', 'Evelyn', 'Cochran', 'played', 'divine', 'wonderful', 'Rebecca', 'Schull', 'Hackett', 'brothers', 'childhood', 'was', ""n't"", 'functional', 'father', 'went', 'crazy', 'mother', 'bailed', 'out', 'kids', 'course', 'have', 'moments', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'what', 'show', 'together', 'genuinely', 'care', 'other', 'onscreen', 'offscreen', 'even', 'spoiler', 'Roy', 'Biggins', 'who', 'get', 'know', 'boy', 'who', 'suffered', 'humiliation', 'youth', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'tough', 'owner', 'Aeromass', 'airlines', 'rival', 'Hackett', 'brother', 'airline', 'Sandpiper', 'just', 'one', 'airplane', 'show', 'also', 'issues', 'homosexuality', 'when', 'Roy', 'son', 'played', 'Abraham', 'Benrubi', 'who', 'was', 'ER', 'now', 'Men', 'Trees', 'out', 'disappointment', 'Roy', 'son', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'meet', 'Roy', 'ex-wife', 'Sylvia', 'played', 'Conchetta', 'Tomei', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'did', 'get', 'nominations', 'was', 'critical', 'hit', 'was', 'beloved', 'show', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'Nantucket', 'still', 'want', 'be', 'Nantucket', 'given', 'opportunity']",Wings - The Complete First and Second Seasons

Joe, the straitlaced do-everything-right brother, is running Sandpiper Air, a small airline on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts that runs commuter flights to the New England coast, when he reluctantly offers a job to Brian, the carefree brother who's also a pilot.Others who work at the airport are Helen Chapel(Crystal Bernard), the former girl-next-door who now works the lunch counter and aspires to be a professional cello player; Lowell Mather(Thomas Haden Church), the not-all-there mechanic; Roy Biggins(David Schramm), the owner of the rival airline AeroMass; and Fay, who handles Sandpiper's front desk. Over the short (six episodes) first season, Joe and Brian develop romantic triangles over both Helen and Brian's ex-wife Carol (Kim Johston Ulrich), and Brian tries to set up Joe with the island tramp (Megan Mullaly).In the second season,(which was the 1990-91 Season) the romantic entanglements continue, Joe develops a health problem that keeps him from flying, and we meet the last major member of the cast, Italian cab driver Antonio Scarpacci (Tony Shalhoub). Guest stars include CHEERS' George Wendt and John Ratzenberger, Abraham Benrubi (ER) as Roy's son, and David Ogden Stiers as a conductor whom Helen tries to impress. While much of the regular cast faded from view after WINGS, Shalhoub and Church garnered critical acclaim for their work on MONK and SIDEWAYS, respectively.Brothers Brian and Joe Hackett (Steven Weber and Timothy Daly) attempt to run a Nantucket-based airline while surrounded by their various wacky friends and employees.
