1112476,A22AD8M2SSOFHJ,B000WZEZFY,"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh""","[0, 2]",Oh those High School days.  The one thing that will always remain the same is teenagers need for companionship.  Of course I made that sound a little better than what actually happens in the movie.  Superbad is filled with numerous situations that some may deem inappropriate although it's not any worse than any American Pie movie that has come out.Michael Cera who plays young Evan has the sweet innocent baby face you would almost never expect to get into predicaments.  His best friend Seth who is played by Jonah Hill seems to have more of the naughty side.  Although both are virgins and are trying to have that memorable experience before they graducate.  Evan is going off to a different college than his friend and this causes some strife thru the movie.  Then of course you have Fogell who is mainly known as Mclovin.  Of course with this trio you get the perfect crazy comedy.Throughout the movie there is language and situations some may not be very comfortable watching.  Except Superbad doesn't pull any punches and everything is very real for anyone who has been in highschool the last twenty years.  This is the type of movie most men will be able to relate to at least one of the characters.There isn't anything that stands out when it comes to the Blu-ray version.  The picture is good and the sound is better but nothing remarkable for this type of movie.  So if you are choosing between the DVD and Blu-ray version I would say get the cheaper DVD.  That is if you can't get the Blu-ray on sale.Superbad is not necessarily a traditional high school movie.  From the sometimes constant profanity to the sexual scenes this movie gives an almost real look to high school life.  What keeps it enjoyable is the hilarious scenes and very good acting that make it memorable.  So if you are looking for a sometimes tasteless comedy that is mainly catered to the male crowd then Superbad is for you.,5,Superbad is Super Good,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,1909,"['Oh', 'High', 'School', 'days', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'same', 'teenagers', 'need', 'companionship', 'course', 'made', 'sound', 'little', 'better', 'what', 'actually', 'movie', 'Superbad', 'filled', 'numerous', 'situations', 'may', 'deem', 'inappropriate', 'not', 'worse', 'American', 'Pie', 'movie', 'come', 'out.Michael', 'Cera', 'who', 'young', 'Evan', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'baby', 'face', 'would', 'almost', 'never', 'expect', 'get', 'predicaments', 'best', 'friend', 'Seth', 'who', 'played', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'have', 'more', 'naughty', 'side', 'are', 'virgins', 'are', 'trying', 'have', 'memorable', 'experience', 'graducate', 'Evan', 'going', 'off', 'different', 'college', 'friend', 'strife', 'thru', 'movie', 'Then', 'course', 'have', 'Fogell', 'who', 'mainly', 'known', 'Mclovin', 'course', 'trio', 'get', 'perfect', 'crazy', 'movie', 'language', 'situations', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'Superbad', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'everything', 'very', 'real', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'highschool', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'type', 'movie', 'most', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'least', 'one', 'characters.There', ""n't"", 'anything', 'out', 'when', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'picture', 'good', 'sound', 'better', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'type', 'movie', 'So', 'are', 'choosing', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'cheaper', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'sale.Superbad', 'not', 'necessarily', 'traditional', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'constant', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'movie', 'almost', 'real', 'look', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'What', 'enjoyable', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'make', 'memorable', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'sometimes', 'tasteless', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'catered', 'male', 'crowd', 'then', 'Superbad']",N/A

Despite being dorky and potty mouthed, each has a major crush on a babe, and when Seth gets invited to a party by his dream date, he willingly agrees when she cajoles him into getting the alcohol for the party.  This brings in the scene stealing Fogell, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) with his very fake ID that gives his name as McLovin, and things start to go really wrong from that point on.An unlikely chain of events leads to the arrival of two really dumb cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen), the crashing of a party with some very bad company, and the heartbreaking loss of a bottle of alcohol.  Eventually they get to the party, where predictably nothing goes according to plan.While the unrestrained profanity and some of the content isn't suitable for young viewers, the one thing that really shines in this movie is the special relationship between Seth and Evan on the road to maturity.Amanda Richards, September 30, 2007",4,"Profanity laden , but has a silver lining",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,1325,"['Movies', 'teens', 'trying', 'get', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'new', 'latest', 'effort', 'really', 'hardest', 'get', 'laughing', 'depending', 'old', 'staples', 'potty', 'humor', 'getting', 'kicked', 'nuts.Evan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'leave', 'high', 'school', 'looking', 'action', 'prepare', 'wild', 'college', 'life', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'being', 'dorky', 'potty', 'mouthed', 'major', 'crush', 'babe', 'when', 'Seth', 'invited', 'party', 'dream', 'date', 'willingly', 'when', 'getting', 'alcohol', 'party', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Fogell', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'very', 'fake', 'ID', 'name', 'McLovin', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'really', 'wrong', 'point', 'on.An', 'unlikely', 'chain', 'events', 'arrival', 'two', 'really', 'dumb', 'cops', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'crashing', 'party', 'very', 'bad', 'company', 'heartbreaking', 'loss', 'bottle', 'alcohol', 'Eventually', 'get', 'party', 'where', 'predictably', 'nothing', 'according', 'plan.While', 'unrestrained', 'profanity', 'content', ""n't"", 'suitable', 'young', 'viewers', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'movie', 'special', 'relationship', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'road', 'maturity.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '30', '2007']",N/A

Three weeks before their graduation and they decide they have to get laid - at least, that's what Seth thinks they should do. The best way to do this - they figure - is to buy loads of alcohol for a party thrown by a girl Seth has a huge crush on, Jules, played by the beautiful Emma Stone. However, being under the legal age of purchasing alcohol, they've hit a major snag. That's when Evan's friend - and Seth's annoyance - comes into help. Fogell (played by newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse) fashions the perfect fake ID; the only problem is he's given himself the single name of McLovin. McLovin gets so close to pulling it off when circumstances beyond the friends' control sends McLovin out on the town with two rebellious cops (Rogen and ""Saturday Night Live's"" Bill Hader), and Seth and Evan at an unruly grown-up party. Of course, the story wouldn't be complete without each guy trying his hardest to hook up with the ""girl of his dreams"" - Becca (Martha MacIsaac) for Evan and Nicola (Aviva) for Fogell.Although ""Superbad"" has plenty of cussing, dirty humor and sexual situations, it's also got a lot of heart and touching surprises. My generation was born right around the time 1978'sNational Lampoon's Animal House (Widescreen Double Secret Probation Edition)with John Belushi came out in the theaters and we had to discover it on video. The next generation was 1982'sFast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)with Sean Penn. The next generation was 1999'sAmerican Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)with Jason Biggs. Now, my daughter's generation - the generation just being born now - will discover ""Superbad"" when they're teenagers and it's released on video. I know this movie will become a cult comedy classic! It's got memorable scenes, quotable dialogue and loads of hysterical laughs. Hill, Cera and Mintz-Plasse are the perfect geeks who are true geeks by today's standards: they aren't the most attractive, they love what they're in to, they yearn for the girl of their dreams, they're picked on quite often in school, and they make their own fun. Of course, Hill and Cera are hilarious, both having experience with perfecting their craft with Hill appearing in comedy hits likeThe 40 Year-Old Virgin (Unrated 2-Disc Double Your Pleasure Edition),Accepted (Widescreen Edition), and ""Knocked Up,"" and Cera playing the perfect ""straightman"" (which he does to perfection in this movie) in TV's Arrested Development - The Complete Series (Seasons 1, 2, 3) and the online cult classic webisodes of ""Clark and Michael."" They both play the perfect, young ""odd couple."" But the true breakout star of this movie is Mintz-Plasse. In an early scene in the movie, his character Fogell meets up with the main protagonists in home economics class; when the teacher shouts his name, the simple look he makes upon being caught is hilarious! His character of Fogell/McLovin will forever be one of the most hilarious high school characters on film ever portrayed.The other breakout star is Emma Stone, who plays Seth's love interest, Jules. Stone had a stint on the all-too-brief FOX show ""Drive,"" and her character Jules in this - with her red hair fashioned after Veronica Lake's famous hairstyle, big blue eyes, and raspy voice - is the best, most attractive, most sincere, most down-to-earth girl of the bunch! If she plays her cards right, Stone will go on to be a major star. Best of all, ""Superbad"" also has appearances by other comic greats who you might not recognize but have seen many times before: Joe Lo Truglio (MTV's ""The State,"" Wet Hot American Summer), Kevin Corrigan (TV's Grounded for Life Seasons 1-4 Bundle), Carla Gallo (TV's Undeclared - The Complete Series), David Krumholtz (Serenity (Collector's Edition), 10 Things I Hate About You, and TV's Numb3rs - The Complete First Season), and Martin Starr (""Knocked Up"" and TV's ""Freaks and Geeks,"" where he was the funniest character on that show).There's no better way to sum up this review than by saying just go see this movie! It is the best comedy I've seen in a long time. I liked ""Knocked Up"" a lot but while that movie was aimed more towards a bit older adults (at least ones with kids), ""Superbad"" aims towards every age. This movie is what it's truly like to be different and picked on. But it's also a movie with a winning, optimistic story because the characters don't care necessarily about fitting in with their schoolmates. They just want to know what the future holds for their friendship and each one wants the one girl of their dreams. While this may not seem like the most profound plot, it's enough to instill the confidence that these characters so desperately need. ""Superbad"" is a comedy that will never get old, especially when it comes to laughing your [...] off!",5,Superbad will be a pop culture classic for generations to come!,1192579200,"10 17,

1112484,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000WZEZFY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I don't know if there is a lot I can say about this movie without getting unfairly censored since this film is one of the most raunchy, vulgar comedies out there, but a lot needs to be said because it is so much more than just your average teenage comedy.  There's a heart that beats beneath this crude exterior that gives the film warmth that I didn't expect.  The film can be abrasive and blunt but it's all done with an innocence that leads to tolerance on the part of the audience.  I'll say this right away though; if you are offended by excessive foul language (and by excessive I mean the F-word alone is used some 186 times) and extremely crude humor than this is not the movie for you.  If you are not easily offended then this may just be the movie you've been waiting for.The story follows best friends Seth and Evan (named after writers Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg) as they get ready for college.  Although they had planned their whole life to attend together their plans are forced to change when Evan gets accepted into a better school than Seth.  They pretend that this doesn't bother them, but it's more than obvious that it does, especially Seth who loathes the idea of his best friend rooming with nerd Fogell.  Before they are separated they decide to attend a huge party and `get with' the girls they have been crushing on for some time now, two attractive girls who for some reason seem interested in them.  Evan and Seth are both shy and reclusive and awkward when it comes to the girls and so even though they have a chance they can't bring themselves to make a move.  That will all end tonight.Before this can happen though they have to complete a very tricky task; purchase alcohol.  After hearing that Fogell was getting a fake ID they promised their crushes that they would provide the booze for the party; a promise that proves to be the biggest adventure of their lives.  Fogell's ID ends up being a huge mistake (the whole `McLovin' thing is just brilliance) and his attempt to purchase the booze is squashed when the liquer store is robbed and he's questioned by two boneheaded cops.  Evan and Seth now must find another way of providing the alcohol.  This leads them to another party where they attempt to steal booze.  In the meantime Fogell is joyriding with Officers Slater and Michaels, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and shooting at street signs.The hi-jinx aside this movie is about friendship and loyalty and that undying bond between two friends, a bond that will never die no matter what amount of strain you place on it.  Seth and Evan throughout the course of the night realize that bond and the final scene in the film is touching and thought provoking, which was a nice sentimental touch to this otherwise outlandish comedy.The acting is so naturally handled that it works brilliantly here.  The two leads are played magnificently by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera (who is having quite the breakout year this year) but the scene stealer is most definitely newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is just brilliantly hysterical as Fogell.  Seth Rogan and Bill Hader make a memorable impression as the two maniac cops who take Fogell on the ride of his life and both Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone beautifully capture the ideal high school hot chicks.  The real star of the show though is Rogan and Goldberg's script which is equal parts humor and heart and keeps the cast spouting memorable and quotable lines, one right after the other.This movie is definitely `superbad'.",5,I'm totally `McLovin' this `Superbad' movie...,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,3516,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lot', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'getting', 'unfairly', 'censored', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'raunchy', 'vulgar', 'comedies', 'there', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'heart', 'crude', 'film', 'warmth', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'abrasive', 'blunt', 'done', 'innocence', 'tolerance', 'part', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'away', 'are', 'offended', 'excessive', 'foul', 'language', 'excessive', 'mean', 'F-word', 'alone', 'used', '186', 'times', 'extremely', 'crude', 'humor', 'not', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'then', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'for.The', 'story', 'best', 'friends', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'named', 'writers', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'get', 'ready', 'college', 'had', 'planned', 'whole', 'life', 'attend', 'together', 'plans', 'are', 'forced', 'change', 'when', 'Evan', 'accepted', 'better', 'school', 'Seth', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'bother', 'more', 'obvious', 'especially', 'Seth', 'who', 'idea', 'best', 'friend', 'rooming', 'nerd', 'Fogell', 'are', 'separated', 'decide', 'attend', 'huge', 'party', 'get', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'crushing', 'time', 'now', 'two', 'attractive', 'girls', 'who', 'reason', 'seem', 'interested', 'Evan', 'Seth', 'are', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'awkward', 'when', 'girls', 'so', 'even', 'have', 'chance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'make', 'move', 'will', 'end', 'can', 'happen', 'have', 'complete', 'very', 'tricky', 'task', 'purchase', 'alcohol', 'hearing', 'Fogell', 'was', 'getting', 'fake', 'ID', 'promised', 'crushes', 'would', 'provide', 'booze', 'party', 'promise', 'be', 'biggest', 'adventure', 'lives', 'Fogell', 'ID', 'up', 'being', 'huge', 'mistake', 'whole', 'McLovin', 'thing', 'just', 'brilliance', 'attempt', 'purchase', 'booze', 'squashed', 'when', 'liquer', 'store', 'robbed', 'questioned', 'two', 'boneheaded', 'cops', 'Evan', 'Seth', 'now', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'providing', 'alcohol', 'party', 'where', 'attempt', 'steal', 'booze', 'meantime', 'Fogell', 'joyriding', 'Officers', 'Slater', 'Michaels', 'drinking', 'beer', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'shooting', 'street', 'signs.The', 'hi-jinx', 'aside', 'movie', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'undying', 'bond', 'two', 'friends', 'bond', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'matter', 'what', 'amount', 'strain', 'place', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'course', 'night', 'realize', 'bond', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'touching', 'thought', 'provoking', 'was', 'nice', 'sentimental', 'touch', 'otherwise', 'outlandish', 'comedy.The', 'acting', 'so', 'naturally', 'handled', 'brilliantly', 'here', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'who', 'having', 'quite', 'breakout', 'year', 'year', 'scene', 'stealer', 'most', 'definitely', 'newcomer', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'who', 'just', 'brilliantly', 'hysterical', 'Fogell', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'make', 'memorable', 'impression', 'two', 'maniac', 'cops', 'who', 'take', 'Fogell', 'ride', 'life', 'Martha', 'MacIsaac', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'beautifully', 'capture', 'ideal', 'high', 'school', 'hot', 'chicks', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Rogan', 'Goldberg', 'script', 'equal', 'parts', 'humor', 'heart', 'cast', 'spouting', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'lines', 'one', 'right', 'other.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'superbad']",N/A

But SUPERBAD becomes an even more exhilirating expreience due to blu ray.  If you love the movie then you know all the great aspects of it from Judd Apatow's production and Greg Mottola's directing to the career making performances from Jonah Hill and Michael Cera.  What could have just been an over the top teen comedy with crude and rude sex and jokes becomes instead a bawdy over the top teen comedy that is realistic, true to life and irresistible.  It is hilarious and yes, there is sex and crude humor but it all has a purpose and this film is comedy at its best.  Seth Rogen wrote the script and his brand of humor along with the gifts of Judd Apatow is starting a whole line of new, inventive comedies.  This film also manages to be very endearing and show the realities of teen hardships, friendship and love and what pubescent years are really like.I was amazed when I popped in the blu ray disc.  It was my 5th time viewing this film and in the opening shot Jonah Hill is cruising forward in a red car and the color was so crisp, the video so enhanced and clear that I was stunned.  Throughout the film, be it day or night, inside or out, the film shines and never loses its intense detail.  The video is in 1080p high definition and delivers throughout.  I never realized how awesome the soundtrack to this film was.  Songs are used to great effect and they will soar out of all surround speakers and set a scene that is amazing.  The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 delivers.  I found watching this film on blu ray with my home theater system to be so much better than seeing it at the movies.  Dialogue is strong and vibrant and combined with the music you can't help but feel joyous.There is a second disc with over 2 hours of hilarious extras and I watched it all.  I am so pleased with this purchase and found this blu ray transfer to be one of the best I've ever seen and definitely the very best of a comedy.  I am a huge fan of SUPERBAD and all involved and am thrilled that blu ray made the viewing experience even more memorable.  Rude, crude, heartwarming and hilarious this film is the best.

I know Superbad is a huge hit but it seems more for people who actually think SNL is funny (sorry, one sketch out of ten = unfunny show).Loved the action scenes and howled at the various escape/chase scenes. The dialogue is a total letdown. Nothing wrong with honest crude and rude dialogue but did any of this ring true? I felt the riffs went on far too long to be believable.The ""McLovin"" joke is a one trick pony. The dumb cops was comedy for dummies with zero plausibility. And why do so many American comedies always have to rely on gunplay for humor? Lighting the cop car on fire, too? Seriously, that was the best you could come up with?The latter ten minutes actually finally felt like the guy had a heart and the kids talked like real teenagers would.Sorry, but all the cash aside that Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen (as inexplicable and unfunny a star as Adam Sandler) are awash in now is not going to make this genre they have conceived any more funny. Maybe I'm wrong but ten years from now, my guess is people will be wondering exactly what drugs we were on to think this stuff was comedic gold.If you want proof, watch the extras.

I had passes to two of the sneak previews and after being in a theatre for the first film and laughing out loud from beginning to end, I saw it the next week only to find that during all the laughing I had actually missed even more jokes and was dying through that as well.  This is without a doubt THE FUNNIEST movie of 2007, if not the funniest of the new millenium.  Yes, its vulgar, yes its sexually driven (with not really any explicit sex scenes) and yes, it features a kid with a fake ID saying hes a 26 year old organ donor from Hawaii named Mclovin.  And every second from beginning to end is hilarious.  And the 2 disk DVD's Special features include some just as funny moments as well, well worth the purchase over the standard DVD without the special features.

This film is without a doubt the funniest teenage comedy I've seen... Ever, in fact it's even better than the original American Pie. The story tells of Seth and Evan two High School seniors who attempt to host one of the biggest beer bashes their town has ever seen and on a side note they hope to score.During the movie the boys come across a problem with their party, they're not old enough to buy beer so they have to get their friend Fogell to get a fake ID and buy the beer for them. This is the historical moment where Fogell transforms into McLovin the 25 year old, Hawaiian organ donor. From start to finish this film is packed with some of the most memorable one liners that you have heard packed into the single motion picture experience.A little warning for you all is that this film pulls no punches.(Well maybe one and Fogell got the brunt) It is simply crude in every aspect of these one liners that I know you will find just as hysterical as I did.

1112499,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000WZEZFY,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","Super Bad? More like Super Good, if you ask me. Of course, in the parlance of youth, Bad = Good, so never mind. It is a great title, and it's also a quote from a funky James Brown song. Seth (Jonah Hill) is the original 'play that funky music, white boy,' and he also has strong opinions about adult entertainment web sites, Art (and what makes an appropriate subject for his precocious drawing talent), when to use lube, his friend Evan's mother, and Home EC. With only three weeks to go before the end of High School, and stuck having to endure Home EC without a partner, he harangues the teacher to let him go:------------Teacher: All right, Jules' partner isn't here either, pair up with her, station four.Seth: Jules? All right I'll give it another shot - give home-ec another shot.==========Jules is not only beautiful, she has an older brother so she is used to the gross style of humor favored by Seth and his associates, but especially by Seth. When she invites him to a party, and even puts him in charge of procuring the alcoholic libations, he is ecstatic. Not exactly athletic, he must tell his best friend Evan (Michael Cera), who is at least athletic enough for the soccer team:------------Gym Teacher: [Blows whistle] Seth, get off the field!Seth: [Kicks soccer ball into the stands] Goal!Gym Teacher: You're getting that!Seth: No I'm not.==========Super Bad tells a familiar story of the last days before graduation, like Can't Hardly Wait, or with a 70's slant, Dazed and Confused. These are the kids who wouldn't dream of going to the prom, but that last party, the last blow out before having to grow up and become adults, they are down for that. Super Bad is the Ultimate Movie about the last High School party because it is funnier than all the rest, and in a strange way (though it does venture into surrealism in its 'anything for a laugh' fashion) more realistic. It is closer to the way High School kids walk, talk, and think--at least the ones I went to school with:------------Evan: It's not just making them smaller. They completely reshaped them. They make them more supple, symmetrical.Seth: I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks. Let's make a move.[they run]==========Of course, as big of losers as Seth and Evan are, there is always that one guy who is an even bigger loser--but you let him hang out with you on a limited basis, half out of pity, and half out of he makes them feel good about themselves. At least they aren't as big of losers as Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse):------------Fogell: Hey!Seth: Don't tell Fogell about the party, man...Fogell: Gangstaaaaaaaaaaasss... what's up guys?=========But when they hear that Fogell is going to get a fake ID, and Seth volunteers to get the booze for Jules' party, that changes everything. Still, it is Fogell we're talking about, so you know they're worried that he'll find a way to screw things up. When he chooses the name ""McLovin,"" no first name, just McLovin, for the fake ID, their prophecy is fulfilled:------------Fogell: No noooo, man. I got it; it is flawless. Check it!Evan: [examining the fake ID] Hawaii. All right, that's good. That's hard to trace, I guess. Wait... you changed your name to... McLovin?Fogell: Yeah.Evan: McLovin? What kind of a stupid name is that, Fogell? What, are you trying to be an Irish R&B; singer?Fogell: Naw, they let you pick any name you want when you get down there.Seth: And you landed on McLovin...Fogell: Yeah. It was between that or Mohammed.==========Evan is a little less volatile than Seth. You might think he was just playing a straight man to Seth's maniac, but Michael Cera has just the right self deprecating slant to get laughs with his own low key brand of humor. He works his magic here like he did as Nick in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, or as Juno's boyfriend in Juno. The only downside is that he seems ubiquitous of late, and is in danger of being typecast for as long as he can maintain his youthful look and not a second longer. As Scott Pilgrim in Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World he has garnered good reviews from a devoted cult following, but as for The World, they are staying away from the movie in droves. Evan tries to keep a lid on Seth's raging paranoia, looks to the bright side:------------Evan: Stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads. It's... it's a fine ID; it'll... it's gonna work. It's passable, okay? This isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell. This guy is either gonna think 'Here's another kid with a fake ID' or 'Here's McLovin, a 25 year-old Hawaiian organ donor'. Okay? So what's it gonna be?Fogell: [grinning] ... I am McLovin!==========Fogell goes in as McLovin, but he really doesn't look 25. And that name! Sheesh. When Evan and Seth see him being driven off in a cop car, they assume he is being taken to jail. Desperate to score some booze so they can 'get with' Jules and Becca, they go to plan B. Seth is hit by a car in the parking lot, and tries to extort some cash or alcohol from Francis, the guy who hit him:------------Francis the Driver: Wait, don't do that. All right, listen. I can get you alcohol. I'm going to this party right now, bro. Okay? It's got booze, it's got girls. Booze and girls equals... I don't know. Do you? I don't know. Do you? I think you do. Do you?==========I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone any more than I already have, but suffice it to say that Evan, Seth, and McLovin all want to get to Jules' party super bad, and whether or not they make it there, or if it all turns out to be the way they planned, there are plenty of super bad hijinks along the way, and Super Bad is hilarious. Here is just one peek at the festivities:------------Becca: [drunkenly making out with Evan] I *so* flirt with you in math.Evan: Tell me about it. I - same-sies.==========Bottom line is that Super Bad is laugh out loud funny. It was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were only 13, so the characters of Seth and Evan are based on them--and there really was a Fogell, too! Seth wanted to play Seth himself, but waited too long, and can't really pass for a High Schooler anymore. He plays a cop instead, along with SNL funnyman Bill Hader as his partner. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera really are just about perfect for their roles, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a perfect McLovin. He was also great in Kick-Ass, BTW.------------Homeless Guy: Hey, hey!

Wilson,"[5, 6]","Apatow's films are funny (seeThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Rated Widescreen Edition)andKnocked Up (Widescreen Edition)) and this one is no different. It's directed by Greg Mottola who didThe Daytrippers, another decent film. These movies take the standard sex comedy fare and add an ultimately conservative twist. For The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the movie says it's a good thing to wait until marriage to have sex. For Knocked Up, casual sex gets one into trouble and babies are better with two dependable parents. Superbad has another conservative message.But don't go looking for a wholesome family affair, for this is not it. If I had to watch this movie with my parents, I fear that I would perhaps pass out. It's raunchy. Even though there may not be nudity per se, these guys talk like real guys, and they don't talk nicely about our, umm, private parts.This movie is the story of Seth and Evan, based on the writers of the script, and one evening during their last weeks of high school before they split up to go to college. They have always been misfits, but finally, they may be able to become cool without changing. That's one of the good things. It isn't about these guys ""fitting in"" with the in-crowd. It's more about the in-crowd realizing that they're actually cool guys.The movie is flawed, though. So much of the script is ad-libbed that some things don't make sense. Characters say things that contradict earlier ideas, and the editors just kept it becuase it happens to be funny. I guess I can forgive that.The DVD has some hilarious extras, too, especially the one with Jonah Hill going through different versions of his lines. I don't know how they decided on only keeping one of them.

1112522,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000WZEZFY,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","I have to agree that this 2007 comedy is ribald and frequently hilarious, but I'm not quite as taken as others by what they see as a paean to male bonding and friendship. That's because there is too stark a contrast between the over-the-top hi-jinks that prevail over most of the running time and the almost whimsically co-dependent way the relationship between the two best friends reveals itself to be. My expectations ran high given that filmmaker Judd Apatow produced the film, and as he proved withThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up, he can bring unexpected heart into the most absurdly comical of situations. However, this delicate balancing act is what seems missing here since he let director Greg Motolla take over the reins this time. Aspiring to be more likeAmerican GraffitithanAmerican Pie, the result is a film with plenty of laughs but fares less in terms of lasting emotional resonance.From a script penned by best friends Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (based on their own awkward adolescent years), the movie has a slim premise - chubby, potty-mouthed Seth and shy, geeky Evan are best friends about to graduate from high school and go to different colleges. Evan got accepted to Dartmouth, while Seth is going to the local community college. Seth, however, has a twist of good luck when he is partnered in home economics class with Jules, one of the school's coolest girls, who invites him and Evan to a big graduation blow-out at her parents' house. So hopped up by his sexual fantasies about Jules, Seth volunteers to take her food allowance and buy liquor for the party. Evan goes along with the shenanigans because he has a crush on Jules' best friend Becca, a good girl who actually likes him. Getting the alcohol is not easy because it means bringing nerdy Fogell into the mix since he has a fake ID that says he is 25, lives in Hawaii and his name is McLovin (just one name please). Needless to say, everything that could go wrong does, and the story splinters between Fogell's adventure with two irresponsible policemen and Seth and Evan's search for alcohol when they think Fogell has been arrested.A spirited cast displays crack comic timing. Jonah Hill, already familiar as one of the slacker housemates inKnocked Up, plays Seth with hormonally-driven brio, while Michael Cera (the put-upon son George-Michael inArrested Developmentand now shining in Juno) makes Evan a quietly affecting dweeb. In his film debut, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a hilarious scene stealer as Fogell. Rogen (with a Fu Manchu moustache) and SNL's Bill Hader display a playful rapport as the police officers who show Fogell how to have a good time, and among the three actresses playing the girls the nerd brigade desires, Emma Stone is a particular standout as the sensible Jules. The drawings reflecting Seth's obsession are hysterically funny, as is the entire liquor store episode. It's too bad that the film feels overlong at nearly two hours, but I do applaud the sheer audacity and emotional transparency of the last scenes.Plenty of extras come with the two-disc Unrated and Extended DVD set in a format that will be familiar to anyone who has bought the DVDs of Apatow's megahits. An entertaining though surprisingly vituperative commentary track is on Disc One with the cast and crew split between LA and New York. Disc Two has all the other extras including deleted scenes, a gag reel and the familiar line-o-rama clip (which shows quick alternative takes with different variations on lines improvised by the actors). There is also a thirteen-minute making-of featurette, video diaries, audition tapes, a short about the dancing opening title sequence, and video footage of early table readings going back to 2002 with different actors. The rest of the extras are targeted to true die-hard fans, such as videotape of a prank pulled on Hill related to his phobia of snakes and a half-hour series of clips called ""Cop Car Confessions"" with various actors in the back seat improvising with Rogen and Hader in the front.",3,Frequently Hilarious Teen Comedy Somewhat More Inconsequential Than Expected,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,4032,"['have', 'agree', '2007', 'comedy', 'ribald', 'frequently', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'taken', 'others', 'what', 'see', 'paean', 'male', 'bonding', 'friendship', 'too', 'stark', 'contrast', 'over-the-top', 'hi-jinks', 'prevail', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'almost', 'whimsically', 'co-dependent', 'way', 'relationship', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'be', 'expectations', 'ran', 'high', 'given', 'filmmaker', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'produced', 'film', 'proved', 'withThe', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Up', 'can', 'bring', 'unexpected', 'heart', 'most', 'absurdly', 'comical', 'situations', 'However', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'what', 'missing', 'here', 'let', 'director', 'Greg', 'Motolla', 'take', 'over', 'reins', 'time', 'Aspiring', 'be', 'more', 'likeAmerican', 'GraffitithanAmerican', 'Pie', 'result', 'film', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'fares', 'less', 'terms', 'lasting', 'emotional', 'resonance.From', 'script', 'penned', 'best', 'friends', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'based', 'own', 'awkward', 'adolescent', 'years', 'movie', 'slim', 'premise', 'chubby', 'potty-mouthed', 'Seth', 'shy', 'geeky', 'Evan', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'go', 'different', 'colleges', 'Evan', 'got', 'accepted', 'Dartmouth', 'Seth', 'going', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'Seth', 'however', 'twist', 'good', 'luck', 'when', 'partnered', 'home', 'economics', 'class', 'Jules', 'one', 'school', 'coolest', 'girls', 'who', 'Evan', 'big', 'graduation', 'blow-out', 'parents', 'house', 'So', 'hopped', 'up', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'Jules', 'Seth', 'take', 'food', 'allowance', 'buy', 'liquor', 'party', 'Evan', 'along', 'shenanigans', 'crush', 'Jules', 'best', 'friend', 'Becca', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'actually', 'Getting', 'alcohol', 'not', 'easy', 'bringing', 'nerdy', 'Fogell', 'mix', 'fake', 'ID', '25', 'lives', 'Hawaii', 'name', 'McLovin', 'just', 'one', 'name', 'please', 'Needless', 'say', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'story', 'splinters', 'Fogell', 'adventure', 'two', 'irresponsible', 'policemen', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'search', 'alcohol', 'when', 'think', 'Fogell', 'been', 'arrested.A', 'spirited', 'cast', 'displays', 'crack', 'comic', 'timing', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'already', 'familiar', 'one', 'slacker', 'inKnocked', 'Up', 'plays', 'Seth', 'hormonally-driven', 'brio', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'put-upon', 'son', 'George-Michael', 'inArrested', 'Developmentand', 'now', 'shining', 'Juno', 'Evan', 'quietly', 'affecting', 'dweeb', 'film', 'debut', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Fogell', 'Rogen', 'Fu', 'Manchu', 'moustache', 'SNL', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'display', 'playful', 'rapport', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'show', 'Fogell', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'three', 'actresses', 'playing', 'girls', 'nerd', 'brigade', 'desires', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'particular', 'standout', 'sensible', 'Jules', 'drawings', 'reflecting', 'Seth', 'obsession', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'entire', 'liquor', 'store', 'episode', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'feels', 'overlong', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'do', 'applaud', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'emotional', 'transparency', 'last', 'scenes.Plenty', 'extras', 'come', 'two-disc', 'Unrated', 'Extended', 'DVD', 'set', 'format', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'Apatow', 'megahits', 'entertaining', 'surprisingly', 'vituperative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Disc', 'One', 'cast', 'crew', 'split', 'LA', 'New', 'York', 'Disc', 'Two', 'other', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'familiar', 'line-o-rama', 'clip', 'quick', 'alternative', 'different', 'variations', 'lines', 'improvised', 'actors', 'also', 'thirteen-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'video', 'diaries', 'audition', 'tapes', 'short', 'dancing', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'video', 'footage', 'early', 'table', 'readings', 'going', 'back', '2002', 'different', 'actors', 'rest', 'extras', 'are', 'targeted', 'true', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'such', 'videotape', 'prank', 'pulled', 'Hill', 'related', 'phobia', 'snakes', 'half-hour', 'series', 'clips', 'called', 'Cop', 'Car', 'Confessions', 'various', 'actors', 'back', 'seat', 'improvising', 'Rogen', 'Hader', 'front']",N/A

1112535,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B000WZEZFY,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[0, 0]","What do you get when you involve members of multiple beloved yet tragically cancelled TV series, with a little foul language and some underage drinking?  The long answer is a movie that may be one of the funniest I have seen in a long time.  The short answer is ""Superbad,"" a new comedy co-Written by Seth Rogen of Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, produced by Judd Apatow of the same, and starring Michael Cera of Arrested Development.Unlike this summer's previous Rogen/Apatow joint venture, Knocked Up, Superbad is a little less high concept, and a lot less dramatic.  That isn't to say it is free of character development or even an occasional touching moment, it just chooses to make a joke even out of those scenes as well.  But where Knocked Up was very much trying to mix its humor with commentary on growing up and responsibility, successfully so, Superbad has no grand aspirations.  It is a light-hearted, laid-back comedy that only spends the time on character development that it does in order to prevent the movie from feeling flat, and spends the rest of its energies on being truly entertaining.The plot is simple, simple enough that it can be summed up in one sentence: two high school losers attempt to get booze for a party in order to win over their respective crushes.  That's pretty much it, and yet the movie plays out at almost two hours, leading us through the events of a single night in these boys' lives, taking us in so many different directions that to try to plot out a course of events for you here would be detrimental to the viewer's enjoyment, suffice to say it never begins to meander or slow down, as some comedies do, and never seems to be out of ideas for what its characters should do next.The two main characters, Seth and Evan (named after its writers, the aforementioned Rogen and Evan Goldberg,) are played with nerd-embracement by Cera and slacker kid movie standard, Jonah Hill.  Hill has worked his way through the Apatow movies, from his single scene in The 40 Year Old Virgin, to his supporting role, appropriately as the best friend of Rogen in Knocked Up, to a lead in Superbad, and Cera takes his first significant part since his three years spent on Arrested Development.Once past the initial shock of hearing George Michael Bluth talk about porn and swearing, the pair are very successful at playing characters who are both innocent as hell, and yet not at all wholesome.  Much like the Geeks half of Freaks and Geeks, these are kids whose lack of success with women stems mostly from their own shyness and social awkwardness, which keeps them from even registering on the radar of the girls that they desire.  The boys of Superbad carry out their machinations with this in mind, in the hopes that they can accomplish the feat that will make them a blip on the girls' scope, preparing them to make their moves.The humor of the movie ranges from slapstick silly, to subtle wit, to cringe-worthy awkwardess, while avoiding for the most part the type of gross-out gag reflex jokes that litter the majority of youth comedies made in the past decade.  No pies are banged, no feces are eaten, and aside from a little bit of drunken vomit and a very unlucky stain, bodily fluids remain mostly inside their hosts.  I'm thankful for this personally, as I've always found character or situation based humor to be much funnier and much longer lasting than the shock of seeing someone go poo.",5,Can you believe they were checking IDs at the door?

The guy's just likable in a sweet, dorky way.  While there are some chuckles in the film, they are far overshadowed by the absolute cringe-worthy language and the absolute annoyance of Jonah Hill.The Bad: Where to start?  A young boy obsessed with drawing male genitalia ... what does that have to do with ANYTHING?  I think it was supposed to be funny but it wasn't.  And it was kind of like one of those trademark Family Guy moments where they intentionally overdue something inane ... except I don't think it was intentional here.  The language in this movie is abominable.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a total prude but the f-bomb is used in this movie like I use the article ""the.""  It's beyond gratuitous.  About fifteen to twenty minutes into the movie we considered turning it off but we stuck through to the end, just waiting to see if it ever ""picked up.""  It didn't.The Summary:  So what exactly is the point of this movie?  Well in a nutshell, it's one of those coming of age movies disguised as a gross-out movie, stealthily hiding a warm and fuzzy friendship tale.  As with most movies of this type, the two main teenage characters, Seth and Evan, are desperately trying to get laid.  In pursuit of this, they must bring alcohol to a party they've managed to get invited to despite their obvious dorkiness.  Helping them in this endeavor is dorkiest buddy Fogell, who is the only one with a fake ID ... one that dubs him McLovin.  Okay, now that actually IS funny.  The rest ... not so much.  Hijinks ensue, but again, mostly a snoozer with excessively excessive foul language.  There are drug scenes, some nudity, yada yada ... stuff that seems to be written by a teenage boy for teenage boys.  How Judd Apatow has managed to become so successful is simply a mystery to me.

1112551,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000WZEZFY,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[0, 1]","Who says you cannot fight for your right to party? This is a must, especially if you're about to graduate from High School and your hormones are going crazy. Those glorious times where the only things we worried about was to buy some alcohol and spend the night with the prettiest girl in school. Those nostalgic days--for most of us--are gone forever, but the memories are fresh in our minds, especially when you watch fun comedies like Superbad. The same guy who brought you The 40 year old Virgin is now back with a story about two friends--and their sidekick nerd--who just want to get drunk and get laid. A simple story indeed, but the fun part is all the things they have to go through to reach that goal. As always for this kind of comedies, the dialogue and jokes are extremely vulgar, but this time around, it works much better than its predecessor Knocked Up because it's more fluent and natural. I sensed a feeling of friendship between the two main characters as well. It was a pretty funny movie experience from the opening credits to the end.Brief Intro Story:Three friends are about to graduate from high school; Seth (Jonah Hill) is the crazy leader; Evan is the nice shy one and Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is your traditional charismatic nerd. As they are talking about their future plans, a school girl Jules (Emma Stone) invites them to her party and gives money to Seth to buy some alcohol. Seth is thrilled about the attention he is getting from Jules and sees an opportunity to finally have sex with her, but his best friend Evan who likes Becca, wants to have a more down-to-earth romantic relationship and doesn't like the idea of getting girls drunk. This is great, but the only problem is to actually buy the beer--obviously, they're underage. Fortunately Fogell has a fake ID and he is going to buy some. As they trying to get to the party--with the drinks--they find more obstacles along their way.Review:Besides the over-the-top sexual jokes and strong language, Superbad works mostly because of the friendship between Seth and Evan. Although they are different--or because of this very reason--these characters are very likable and have a strong chemistry on screen. Their conversations are spontaneous and extremely funny. There are always wondering if they are going to get the girl or what's going to happen after high school. A big question mark that many of us (grown-ups) asked ourselves during those days and Superbad brings you those nostalgic, but good memories. The film is a guilty pleasure and many will relate to it.One of the best attributes of the film is the subplot where Fogell ends up with two crazy cops--right after Fogell got knocked out by a thief at the liquor store. They become good friends, and then decide just drive around doing all kinds of crazy stuff. One of the funniest situations happened during this odd friendship where these cops are more irresponsible and dangerous than the criminals.Unfortunately Superbad suffers from the same illness as its ""cousin"" comedy Knocked Up. The film is a bit longer than it should--114 minutes is a bit too long for a comedy, so editing could have been better. Although the ending is satisfying, the movie looses momentum right after the big party due to the lack of humor and forced drama. Also some of the jokes and language might be too much for some moviegoers.The Verdict:Is this The Revenge of the Nerds of the 21st Century? I think so. Superbad is your ""super"" vulgar over-the-top comedy that relies on strong language, sex jokes and visuals, but it has the charm and charisma to keep you entertain. It is an excellent experience, especially for the younger audience.",4,Revenge of the Nerds of the 21st Century,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,3682,"['Who', 'can', 'not', 'fight', 'right', 'party', 'must', 'especially', ""'re"", 'graduate', 'High', 'School', 'hormones', 'are', 'going', 'crazy', 'glorious', 'times', 'where', 'only', 'things', 'worried', 'about', 'was', 'buy', 'alcohol', 'spend', 'night', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'school', 'nostalgic', 'days', 'most', 'are', 'gone', 'forever', 'memories', 'are', 'fresh', 'minds', 'especially', 'when', 'watch', 'fun', 'comedies', 'Superbad', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'brought', '40', 'year', 'old', 'Virgin', 'now', 'back', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'sidekick', 'nerd', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'drunk', 'get', 'laid', 'simple', 'story', 'indeed', 'fun', 'part', 'things', 'have', 'go', 'reach', 'goal', 'always', 'kind', 'comedies', 'dialogue', 'jokes', 'are', 'extremely', 'vulgar', 'time', 'around', 'much', 'better', 'predecessor', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'more', 'fluent', 'natural', 'sensed', 'feeling', 'friendship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'experience', 'opening', 'credits', 'end.Brief', 'Intro', 'Story', 'Three', 'friends', 'are', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'crazy', 'leader', 'Evan', 'nice', 'shy', 'one', 'Fogell', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'traditional', 'charismatic', 'nerd', 'are', 'talking', 'future', 'plans', 'school', 'girl', 'Jules', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'party', 'money', 'Seth', 'buy', 'alcohol', 'Seth', 'thrilled', 'attention', 'getting', 'Jules', 'opportunity', 'finally', 'have', 'sex', 'best', 'friend', 'Evan', 'who', 'Becca', 'have', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'romantic', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'getting', 'girls', 'drunk', 'great', 'only', 'problem', 'actually', 'buy', 'beer', 'obviously', ""'re"", 'underage', 'Fortunately', 'Fogell', 'fake', 'ID', 'going', 'buy', 'trying', 'get', 'party', 'drinks', 'find', 'more', 'obstacles', 'way.Review', 'over-the-top', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'strong', 'language', 'Superbad', 'mostly', 'friendship', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'are', 'different', 'very', 'reason', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'have', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'conversations', 'are', 'spontaneous', 'extremely', 'funny', 'are', 'always', 'wondering', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'girl', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'high', 'school', 'big', 'question', 'mark', 'many', 'grown-ups', 'asked', 'ourselves', 'days', 'Superbad', 'nostalgic', 'good', 'memories', 'film', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'many', 'will', 'relate', 'it.One', 'best', 'attributes', 'film', 'subplot', 'where', 'Fogell', 'up', 'two', 'crazy', 'cops', 'right', 'Fogell', 'got', 'knocked', 'out', 'thief', 'liquor', 'store', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'then', 'decide', 'just', 'drive', 'around', 'doing', 'kinds', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'One', 'funniest', 'situations', 'happened', 'odd', 'friendship', 'where', 'cops', 'are', 'more', 'irresponsible', 'dangerous', 'criminals.Unfortunately', 'Superbad', 'suffers', 'same', 'illness', 'cousin', 'comedy', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'film', 'bit', 'longer', 'should', '114', 'minutes', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'comedy', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'momentum', 'right', 'big', 'party', 'due', 'lack', 'humor', 'forced', 'drama', 'Also', 'jokes', 'language', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'moviegoers.The', 'Verdict', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', '21st', 'Century', 'think', 'so', 'Superbad', 'super', 'vulgar', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'strong', 'language', 'sex', 'jokes', 'visuals', 'charm', 'charisma', 'keep', 'entertain', 'excellent', 'experience', 'especially', 'younger', 'audience']",N/A

1112556,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000WZEZFY,K. Driscoll,"[6, 8]","For the most part Superbad is full of comedy shortcuts and some language intended to shock.  In other words, it didn't blow me away with its creativity and I suppose that is one reason I was very perplexed to see this film so widely praised by critics (i.e. Richard Roeper put this in his top ten of 2007).  Another reason would be the fact that it is a pure comedy feature and films like that are skewered by critics of all kinds more often than not.Superbad is produced by Judd Apatow, the hugely successful director ofThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up, and it is directed by Greg Mottola who previously worked on television's hilariousArrested Development.  It was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg as additionally evident by the two protagonists' names, Seth and Evan.  Rogan also plays a local cop who adds some great laughs along with his partner played by the even funnier Bill Hader.Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are high schools buddies in their senior year before going to attend different colleges.  The whole story centers around their quest to illegally obtain alcohol and ration it among some peers at a high school party that Seth was invited to by his love interest Jules (Emma Stone).  Seth insists that getting a girl drunk is the easiest way for him to get laid, hence the primary motive to get everyone drunk.  Their friend Fogell (Chris Mintz-Plasse) has a fake ID that could help them in their quest but Fogell's ID has him with the single name of ""McLovin'"" and doesn't seem very convincing.  Fogell is assaulted during a robbery of the liquor store where he was purchasing the drinks and the cops, played by Hader and Rogan, arrive to question him.  Adventure ensues as Fogell travels around town with these two insane police officers.  Separately, Evan and Seth continue their search for alcohol, assuming that Fogell got nabbed by the cops for buying alcohol underage.I thought this film was at times intentionally dirty and overly derivative.  I also didn't find the film to be remotely believable.  The cops in particular were entirely too over the top and their antics bordered on cartoon-like at times, albeit still really funny.  There are some really great moments of humor here but because the film goes too far now and then, the more genuine moments were in no way convincing to me and that is were Superbad falls short and its dramatic moments essentially become meaningless.  It's funny because I think Knocked Up was close to doing that too but the makers of Superbad want the viewer to suspend disbelief entirely, on their schedule, and only when it is convenient for them.  That didn't really work for me but I laughed far too much during this movie to not give it a slight recommendation.",3,"Gratuitously Filthy and too Silly at Times, but Still Hilarious",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2748,"['most', 'part', 'Superbad', 'full', 'comedy', 'shortcuts', 'language', 'intended', 'shock', 'other', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'creativity', 'suppose', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'very', 'perplexed', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'widely', 'praised', 'critics', 'i.e', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'put', 'top', 'ten', '2007', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'pure', 'comedy', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'skewered', 'critics', 'kinds', 'more', 'often', 'not.Superbad', 'produced', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'hugely', 'successful', 'director', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Up', 'directed', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'television', 'hilariousArrested', 'Development', 'was', 'written', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'additionally', 'evident', 'two', 'protagonists', 'names', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'Rogan', 'also', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'great', 'laughs', 'partner', 'played', 'even', 'funnier', 'Bill', 'Hader.Evan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'are', 'high', 'schools', 'buddies', 'senior', 'year', 'going', 'attend', 'different', 'colleges', 'whole', 'story', 'centers', 'quest', 'illegally', 'obtain', 'alcohol', 'ration', 'peers', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'Seth', 'was', 'invited', 'love', 'interest', 'Jules', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Seth', 'getting', 'girl', 'drunk', 'easiest', 'way', 'get', 'laid', 'hence', 'primary', 'motive', 'get', 'everyone', 'drunk', 'friend', 'Fogell', 'Chris', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'fake', 'ID', 'could', 'help', 'quest', 'Fogell', 'ID', 'single', 'name', 'McLovin', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'convincing', 'Fogell', 'assaulted', 'robbery', 'liquor', 'store', 'where', 'was', 'purchasing', 'drinks', 'cops', 'played', 'Hader', 'Rogan', 'arrive', 'question', 'Adventure', 'Fogell', 'town', 'two', 'insane', 'police', 'officers', 'Separately', 'Evan', 'Seth', 'continue', 'search', 'alcohol', 'assuming', 'Fogell', 'got', 'nabbed', 'cops', 'buying', 'alcohol', 'underage.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'times', 'intentionally', 'dirty', 'overly', 'derivative', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'be', 'remotely', 'believable', 'cops', 'particular', 'were', 'entirely', 'too', 'top', 'antics', 'bordered', 'cartoon-like', 'times', 'albeit', 'still', 'really', 'funny', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'moments', 'humor', 'here', 'film', 'too', 'far', 'now', 'then', 'more', 'genuine', 'moments', 'were', 'way', 'convincing', 'were', 'Superbad', 'short', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'essentially', 'become', 'meaningless', 'funny', 'think', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'was', 'close', 'doing', 'too', 'makers', 'Superbad', 'want', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'entirely', 'schedule', 'only', 'when', 'convenient', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'laughed', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'give', 'slight', 'recommendation']",N/A

Despite my initial reservations, I found myself warming to it quite quickly.Technically, this film breaks little new ground: it's a ""triumph of the nerds"" type with the ""buddies being broken apart"" subplot, both being themes which have been done enough to run the risk of cliche. Of course, this isn't a movie you watch for the plot but listen to for the dialogue interaction.In retrospect, I'm reminded of early Kevin Smith movies, though this is (marginally) more highbrow -- or at least LESS lowbrow -- than, say, Clerks, as it doesn't delve (as much) into scatological humor. Obviously, the two SuperBad kids are obsessed with sex (what teenager isn't?) so a goodly portion of the jokes delve into the raunchy, with the only redeeming feature being that they actually deliver the laughs. There are quite a few chuckles throughout, and even some laugh-out-loud moments that still bring a smile to my face as I type this.Obviously, this film isn't for everyone, though the main exclusionary demographic would be those who prefer ""wholesome family entertainment."" Superbad sure isn't that. Pivotal to the plot are glorifications of premarital sex and underage drinking. Per IMDB, there are as many uses of the ""F"" word as there are minutes in the film. So parents be warned.To me, this has a ""worth watching once"" ranking, and as such I had little desire to check out the bonus dvd.

1112572,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000WZEZFY,Mike Zimmerman,"[9, 18]","Best friends Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are about to part seperate ways when they go to different colleges instead of going to the same one like they planned. That's the least of their problems. For their entire high school years, they haven't made much of a mark, especially with the ladies. When Seth's love interest Jules (Emma Stone) opens the gates for him to join her graduation party, he coerces Evan to help purchase alcoholic refreshments. Also joining in on the fun is fellow outcast Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who hopes to use a fake ID to help out. But misadventures and two fun-loving cops (Bill Hader, Seth Rogen) rear their heads in.I really, REALLY hate to be the odd man out, but I was a little disappointed with ""Superbad"". It's worse because it's produced by Judd Apatow, the man who did the you-can't-hate-them-even-if-you-could raunchfests ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", while Greg Motolla was behind the vastly underrated ""Undeclared"". But while the film isn't a total loss, and there are some good laughs, they don't come as frequent as they did in Apatow's recent features.Where Motolla and Apatow get things right is in the opening, which utilizes the vintage Columbia Pictures logo to kick things off, then proceed with the shadows of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera dancing to a classic funky tune that you've heard in the trailers a million times. They also use plenty of classic songs in the movie as well, including KC and the Sunshine Band's ""Boogieman"", Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"", Van Halen's ""Panama"", and many more joints like that. Call it a throwback to a time when films were looking to push that R rating.Superbad falls flat in the laugh department at times, as well as the last couple halves of the film. Recent Apatow films have been subject to these criticisms, though charming performances and plenty of laugh-out-loud gags kept the film afloat that it didn't really matter. Not that this film has its share of moments. Jonah Hill, another Apatow regular (""Knocked Up"", anyone?), pretty much owns the movie with his ballsy comic timing, peppering the script with hilarious profanities and some outrageous moments (while he and his friends are drinking, he gives their balls what's coming to them). And you could not say anything bad about Mintz-Plasse, especially when the iconic ""McLovin"" moments pop up, and he gets further compliments from co-stars Rogen (who wrote the script) and Hader (definitely on his A game, compared to his worthless side performance in ""Hot Rod"").But sadly, the same can't be said for Michael Cera. Compared to what everyone has raved about him, there were times in the movie where the former ""Arrested Development"" co-star seems to be asleep and mumbling his lines. It's when he's paired up with Hill and Mintz-Plasse that he gets some added charm that he lacks whether he's dealing with some crazy partygoers (it's right here where the film goes off the tracks) or a boring subplot where he hopes to get with Martha MacIsaac's character (admittedly, she's got some worthwhile acting chops that I wished she had someone better to work with - same thing happened in ""Kickin' it Old School"" with Jamie Kennedy and Maria Menounous). It's a shame, because I thought Cera could own this role, but he comes off as a poor man's Tobey Maguire.But that was just my opinion, and I'll hold to it. I'll admit, the film had a couple of laugh-out-loud moments courtesy of Hill (expect him to continue his road to superstardom), Mintz-Plasse (ditto), Hader, and Rogen. And it's balls-to-the-wall risque. But compared to other Apatow projects, it's forced to take backseat. Oh well, Apatow might be able to get back to his A game with future projects like ""The Pineapple Express"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"".",3,"""That was bonafide bad***.""",1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,3790,"['Best', 'friends', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Evan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'are', 'part', 'seperate', 'ways', 'when', 'go', 'different', 'colleges', 'instead', 'going', 'same', 'one', 'planned', 'least', 'problems', 'entire', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'much', 'mark', 'especially', 'ladies', 'When', 'Seth', 'love', 'interest', 'Jules', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'gates', 'join', 'graduation', 'party', 'Evan', 'help', 'purchase', 'alcoholic', 'refreshments', 'Also', 'joining', 'fun', 'fellow', 'outcast', 'Fogell', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'who', 'use', 'fake', 'ID', 'help', 'out', 'misadventures', 'two', 'fun-loving', 'cops', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'rear', 'heads', 'in.I', 'really', 'REALLY', 'hate', 'be', 'odd', 'man', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Superbad', 'worse', 'produced', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""you-can't-hate-them-even-if-you-could"", '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Greg', 'Motolla', 'was', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'Undeclared', 'film', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'are', 'good', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'frequent', 'did', 'Apatow', 'recent', 'features.Where', 'Motolla', 'Apatow', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'opening', 'vintage', 'Columbia', 'logo', 'kick', 'things', 'off', 'then', 'proceed', 'shadows', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'dancing', 'classic', 'funky', 'tune', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'trailers', 'million', 'times', 'also', 'use', 'plenty', 'classic', 'songs', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'KC', 'Sunshine', 'Band', 'Boogieman', 'Motorhead', 'Ace', 'Spades', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Panama', 'many', 'more', 'joints', 'Call', 'throwback', 'time', 'when', 'films', 'were', 'looking', 'push', 'R', 'rating.Superbad', 'flat', 'laugh', 'department', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'couple', 'halves', 'film', 'Recent', 'Apatow', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'criticisms', 'charming', 'performances', 'plenty', 'laugh-out-loud', 'gags', 'kept', 'film', 'afloat', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Not', 'film', 'share', 'moments', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Apatow', 'regular', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'anyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'ballsy', 'comic', 'timing', 'peppering', 'script', 'hilarious', 'profanities', 'outrageous', 'moments', 'friends', 'are', 'drinking', 'balls', 'what', 'coming', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'especially', 'when', 'iconic', 'McLovin', 'moments', 'pop', 'up', 'further', 'compliments', 'co-stars', 'Rogen', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Hader', 'definitely', 'A', 'game', 'compared', 'worthless', 'side', 'performance', 'Hot', 'Rod', '.But', 'sadly', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Compared', 'what', 'everyone', 'raved', 'were', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'former', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'co-star', 'be', 'asleep', 'mumbling', 'lines', 'when', 'paired', 'up', 'Hill', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'added', 'charm', 'dealing', 'crazy', 'partygoers', 'right', 'here', 'where', 'film', 'tracks', 'boring', 'subplot', 'where', 'get', 'Martha', 'MacIsaac', 'character', 'admittedly', 'got', 'acting', 'chops', 'wished', 'had', 'someone', 'better', 'work', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Kickin', 'Old', 'School', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Maria', 'Menounous', 'shame', 'thought', 'Cera', 'could', 'own', 'role', 'off', 'poor', 'man', 'Tobey', 'Maguire.But', 'was', 'just', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'hold', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'film', 'had', 'couple', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'Hill', 'expect', 'continue', 'road', 'superstardom', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'ditto', 'Hader', 'Rogen', 'balls-to-the-wall', 'risque', 'compared', 'other', 'Apatow', 'projects', 'forced', 'take', 'backseat', 'Oh', 'well', 'Apatow', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'A', 'game', 'future', 'projects', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Drillbit', 'Taylor']",N/A

The picture quality, it wasn't up to par with other films, such as Knocked Up.  I have a PS3 running on a HDMI cable, so I can watch BluRay discs in 1080p glory, but when I popped in Superbad, it wasn't the same picture quality I saw in theatres I believe.  The contrast and brightness seems dimmed and dark, it wasn't bright enough, and my TV is well calibrated so there is nothing wrong with my settings, but i had to fool around with the brightness and the contrast with this one.  And the price of the Bluray is waaaaaaay to high, especially for this kind of film, which I find strange.  Anywayz, I haven't compared this to the regular DVD version, so I don't know if there are any difference in the brightness/contrast levels, but all in all, the MOVIE is worth the buy.  The audio was okay, can't really review the audio since it's not that type of film.  The extras is jam packed, but I do wish the making of the film was longer and there are more interviews.  It's the same kind of extras on Knocked Up, with hilarious ""fake"" improv extras.

Let's go down the list:AMERICAN PIE - Intercourse with an apple pieAMERICAN PIE 2 - Intercourse with oneself, and subsequent adhesion to oneself.THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY - We got both the unorthodox Hairgel, and the Frank'n'Beans scene, which is every man's worst nightmare.BORAT - The Infamous wrestling match, in which the particapants wear their birthday suits.EVOLUTION - Orlando Jones' impromptu rectal operation.DUMB AND DUMBER - The Cop discovering the true contents on a beer bottle.FREDDY GOT FINGERED - Essentially, the whole movie.In SUPERBAD, Seth (Jonah Hill), along with his buddy Evan (Michael Cera) find themselves at a party they do not intend to stay at. They are on a quest for alcohol, in the hopes that it will allow them to destablize the inhibitons of their two dream grils, and they can free themsleves of their virginity. They just have to get to Jules' (Emma Stone) party to accomplish this.Their first attempt at obtaining alcohol meet with failure through a bizarre series of misunderstandings. Suffice it to that their token tool Fogel (Chris Mintz-Plasse, who is nothing if not a show-stealer) has been taken under the wing of two fun-loving policemen (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) after they come to believe that Fogel's fake I.D. is genuine (the I.D. in question sets Fogel up as a 25-year Hawaiian old organ donor named ""McLovin"".)With Seth and Evan now under the mistaken impression that Fogel/McLovin has been arrested, they are low on cash and even lower on booze. They eventually decide to accompany a clumsy driver to a party he was never invited to, while they make off with the alochol.And then it happens - one partygoer points out what appears to be a blood stain on Seth's pants. When Seth confirms that he had been dancing with a thoroughly tipsy girl earlier in the evening, he suddenly realizes that he has been the recepticle of her body's natural cycle of maintance.This is only one of the hiliarious gags SUPERBAD throws at you. To discuss them any further is to do SUPERBAD a diservice, though the name ""McLovin"" is by itself enough to inspire the kind of the laughter to will cause an eruption of soda from one's nostrils.More than most ribald gross-out comedies, SUPERBAD has a heart. On the surface, it's just a series of profanity, gags, pratfalls, and sexual innuedo, but at it's center is the story of two life-long buddies who know that they will be attending separate colleges in a matter of months. Their hilarious misadventures in the course of SUPERBAD are, when you boil it down, two close friends wishing to see each other off in the most fun-filled night they can dream up.A SUPERBAD sequel is certainly in order, although the prospect of a solo McLovin comedy, which should also feature his party-animal cops friends, would be even more enticing.",5,I am McLovin it.,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,3344,"['SUPERBAD', 'just', 'one', 'series', 'young-adult', 'oriented', 'comedies', 'revolve', 'around', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'quest', 'free', 'shackles', 'virginity', 'grown', 'men', 'searching', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'will', 'inevitably', 'enrage', 'so', 'manner', 'other', 'later', 'discover', 'right', 'buttons', 'push', 'will', 'elicit', 'fervent', ""'m"", 'sorry', '.All', 'have', 'outrageously', 'hilarious', 'gag', 'usually', 'involving', 'sometime', 'body', 'fluid', 'other', 'substance', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'desirable', 'find', 'covered', 'Let', 'go', 'down', 'list', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'Intercourse', 'apple', 'pieAMERICAN', 'PIE', '2', 'Intercourse', 'oneself', 'subsequent', 'adhesion', 'oneself.THERE', ""'S"", 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'MARY', 'got', 'unorthodox', 'Hairgel', 'Frank', ""n'Beans"", 'scene', 'man', 'worst', 'Infamous', 'wrestling', 'match', 'particapants', 'wear', 'birthday', 'suits.EVOLUTION', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'impromptu', 'rectal', 'operation.DUMB', 'AND', 'DUMBER', 'Cop', 'discovering', 'true', 'contents', 'beer', 'bottle.FREDDY', 'GOT', 'FINGERED', 'Essentially', 'whole', 'movie.In', 'SUPERBAD', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'buddy', 'Evan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'find', 'party', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'stay', 'are', 'quest', 'alcohol', 'hopes', 'will', 'allow', 'destablize', 'inhibitons', 'two', 'dream', 'grils', 'can', 'free', 'themsleves', 'virginity', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'Jules', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'party', 'accomplish', 'this.Their', 'first', 'attempt', 'obtaining', 'alcohol', 'meet', 'failure', 'bizarre', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'Suffice', 'token', 'tool', 'Fogel', 'Chris', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'who', 'nothing', 'not', 'show-stealer', 'been', 'taken', 'wing', 'two', 'fun-loving', 'policemen', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'come', 'believe', 'Fogel', 'fake', 'I.D', 'genuine', 'I.D', 'question', 'sets', 'Fogel', 'up', '25-year', 'Hawaiian', 'old', 'organ', 'donor', 'named', 'McLovin', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'now', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'Fogel/McLovin', 'been', 'arrested', 'are', 'low', 'cash', 'even', 'lower', 'booze', 'eventually', 'decide', 'accompany', 'clumsy', 'driver', 'party', 'was', 'never', 'invited', 'make', 'off', 'alochol.And', 'then', 'one', 'partygoer', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'blood', 'stain', 'Seth', 'pants', 'When', 'Seth', 'had', 'been', 'dancing', 'thoroughly', 'tipsy', 'girl', 'earlier', 'evening', 'suddenly', 'been', 'recepticle', 'body', 'natural', 'cycle', 'maintance.This', 'only', 'one', 'hiliarious', 'gags', 'SUPERBAD', 'discuss', 'further', 'do', 'SUPERBAD', 'diservice', 'name', 'McLovin', 'enough', 'inspire', 'kind', 'laughter', 'will', 'cause', 'eruption', 'soda', 'one', 'nostrils.More', 'most', 'ribald', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'SUPERBAD', 'heart', 'surface', 'just', 'series', 'profanity', 'gags', 'pratfalls', 'sexual', 'innuedo', 'center', 'story', 'two', 'life-long', 'buddies', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'separate', 'colleges', 'matter', 'months', 'hilarious', 'misadventures', 'course', 'SUPERBAD', 'are', 'when', 'boil', 'down', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'wishing', 'see', 'other', 'off', 'most', 'fun-filled', 'night', 'can', 'dream', 'up.A', 'SUPERBAD', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'order', 'prospect', 'solo', 'McLovin', 'comedy', 'should', 'also', 'feature', 'party-animal', 'cops', 'friends', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'enticing']",N/A

Comparisons with ""American Pie"" are inevitable - same subject matter and so forth - but ""Superbad"" is a lot more demanding, and a lot more rewarding because of that.Cera, Hill and Mintz-Plasse (Fogell) give outstanding performances, particularly the former pair - there's a believable and honest chemistry between these two actors and their friendship is completely plausible. Cera's the stronger of the two actors - his Evan's a believable and sympathetic kid - but Hill is equally strong during their shared scenes. While Fogell might have been included simply for laughs, Mintz-Plasse does an excellent job with what he's given, and his scenes of slapstick and comic sexual redemption are excellent antidotes to the sometimes more serious antics of Seth & Jonah.Supporting cast is unusually good for a teen movie, with nods to Emma Stone, Seth Rogen, and Bill Hader.The direction's pretty average, but competent nonetheless - where ""Superbad"" really shines behind the camera is in the writing. Writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg have created a series of beautifully-realised characters that strike the happiest of mediums between OTT slapstick and realistic empathy with the audience. We root for these foulmouthed, stupid teenagers right from the get-go, and by the film's end, we've definitely got a feel-good sense of satisfaction about what we've just seen.""Superbad"" (including a fantastic soundtrack, by the way!!) is, across the board, a thoroughly excellent movie.

""Superbad"" is not going to give it to you.  Seth Rogen is one of the most overrated people in Hollywood - he does have a unique sense of humor, though: the kind that isn't funny. Thanks to Judd Apatow (ultra mediocre director/producer) and The Apatow Company's newly-found clout combined with the studio's publicity department, ""Superbad"" somehow did really well at the box office (as did the equally mediocre ""40 Year Old Virgin"", and the somewhat better ""Knocked Up"", thanks to good acting).Not coincidentally, the two main characters of Superbad are named Seth and Evan (after Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg.)  Jonah Hill, playing Seth, couldn't act to save his life.  For 2 hours, all he/his character does is rant and yell.  Michael Cera, playing Evan, is a bit better, but not much.  The men of the hour in ""Superbad"" are newbie Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogel aka McLovin, and SNL's Bill Hader as Cop #2 (Rogen plays Cop #1 - and he wisely trimmed his usual Cabbage Patch Kid hair for the role).  Plasse plays the quintessential geeky high school misfit (who, like Finch of the American Pie movies, has a wild side that is uncovered over the course of the movie.)  The best scenes are the ones with Plasse and Hader, particularly the great liquor store sequence - the chick who plays the cashier and the Mexican employee are EXcellent.  The rest of the movie is filled with Kevin Smith-style filth (only the storyline is nowhere near as good as any of what's in Kev's films.)  Nearly all of the humor is very forced and exaggeraged - a beautiful case in point being the party sequence where the tone-deaf Cera sings to a room full of coke addicts, and when Hill gets (oooh!) ""period blood"" on his pants while dancing with the fiancee of the guy throwing the party.  I just about puked when the party guest put his finger on Hill's pants to see what that ""curious red stain"" was.  YUCK.Now, let's address the issue of the chicks.  Could they have gotten two UGLIER, less-appealing girls to play Becca and Jules?!  The actress who plays Jules almost seems lesbionic (not that that's a bad thing at all, but it was definitely miscasting.)The best aspect of the film is the relationship of Seth and Evan, and how they deal with the impending separation as they go to different colleges.There are some touching moments - especially the ending.  But other than that, plus the scenes with Hader and Plasse....""Superbad"" really doesn't quite cut it and just seems to be a ripoff of many similar teen comedies.Hard to believe that it far-outdid many of these other comedies at the box office.

Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) are lifelong best friends who really want to lose their virginity before heading to college. When they are invited to the year's biggest party, the boys use their friend Fogell's (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) new fake I.D. to score some alcohol for the party but their plan soon turns to a madcap night of unpredictable and outrageous situations. ""Superbad"" is an uproariously funny teen comedy from the creators of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"". The raunchy teen comedy delivers a well paced storyline, some side-splitting moments and memorable comic performances. Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) and Bill Hader (SNL) are hilarious as two incompetent police officers. ""Superbad"" received overwhelming positive reviews from US critics and became one of the year's highest grossing comedies with over $130 million nationwide.If you've enjoyed ""Superbad"" in theaters, then I strongly recommend checking out ""Superbad"" Unrated Edition. The raunchy teen comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format with more unrated footage that wasn't included in its theatrical release. The picture quality is surprisingly good with no obvious flaws. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is clear and well balanced. Among supplemental material, the DVD includes 8 minutes of deleted scenes, trailers, a short gag reel, ""Cop Car Confessions"" and ""The Making of Superbad"" featurettes, an exclusive sneak peek of the upcoming comedy ""Pineapple Express"" and an audio commentary with director Greg Mottola, production crew and cast members.

At the risk of pissing off alot of people, I will even say that it might be the best high school comedy ever. It was definitely a big surprise when I first saw it. I was a sophmore in high school, and literally did not know who any of the actors in the movie were. Not even Seth Rogen. I've grown to become a fab of the director, Greg Motolla over the last few years. The combination of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse will forever be one of my favorite trios in comedy history. Alot of people don't like Michael Cera's dry, emotionless acting style, but I do. Even from his days of Arrested Development, I've just enjoyed his delivery style. It's uniquely his. His portrayal of Evan was the perfect fit, right between obnoxious Seth and dorky Fogell. I felt so much of myself in Evan that it was a more enlightening, and heartfelt experience for me. I have to say this movie puts me right back into my last few weeks of high school every time I watch it. Despite there being a long history of movies set in high school, Superbad felt like a fresh concept to me. It didn't feel like it was recycling the high school jokes that have been used repeatedly.The transfer is amazing to me. Maybe that's because I had culture shock when I firsted watched the Blu-ray after years of repeatedly watching it on DVD. The differences were alarming. The extras are top notch. Apatow productions never disappoint.

1112605,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000WZEZFY,Robert Moore,"[1, 3]","I liked this movie a bit more than perhaps I should have.  There is absolutely no question that it contains a host of wildly hysterical moments, but it does raise the question of whether the movie existed for the sake of the jokes or the jokes for the sake of the movie.  The plot, in fact, seems close to nonexistent, or to be more accurate, the story is irrelevant.  What plot there is seems to be there in order to hand jokes on.  I think whether and to what degree you will like SUPERBAD will depend on whether it matters to you whether a movie tells any kind of story and whether you are or are not offended by the many topics of conversation.Personally, I'm willing to forgive the movie a certain hollowness at its heart for the sake of the jokes.  I laughed hard and I laughed often throughout the film, even while I knew that it had a number of flaws.  So, this will never be a model for a film class on how to write a script.  It might, however, be used by aspiring comics for how to tell a joke.  The story, such as it is, concerns three high school losers enamored of girls who would seem to be out of their league.  When one of the girls learns that one of the guys has a fake I.D. (actually, his boast was a lie), she asks him to buy liquor for a party she is throwing.  Most of the movie revolves around the attempt to get the liquor to that party.  The two main characters recruit a third to use his astonishingly awful fake I.D. (an Hawaiian D.L. identifying him as ""McLovin"" and no first name).  ""McLovin"" (actually, a nerd named Fogell) gets separated from Seth and Evan (named after the writers of the screenplay, Seth Rogen -- who also plays one of the two cops who feature prominently in the film -- and Evan Goldberg) when his attempt to buy liquor is interrupted by a robbery.  He spends most of the movie traveling around with two extraordinarily funny cops.  Meanwhile Seth and Evan, thinking that Fogell has been arrested by the police but determined to get to the party with booze, strike out on their own.  Like I said, none of this really matters.  This is one of those films in which the journey, not the destination is what matters.This is not for everyone.  If you are bothered by excessive obscene language, this movie could leave you feeling disturbed.  Unbelievably, there is no explicit nudity, but there is explicit discussion of pornography, sex, genitalia (as well as a number of graphic drawings of male genitalia), and any number of off color topics.  The ""F"" word is used excessively.  I'm sure there are movies that have more excessive obscene language, but there cannot be many.  This ranks roughly with BADDER SANTA for sheer quantity of curse words.  So be forewarned:  in the land of obscene language, SUPERBAD would reign as king.SUPERBAD features one very, very funny cast.  A long string of people have great, if small moments, but several really stand out.  I have argued with people that Michael Cera may have been the most gifted teen comic actor ever to come along.  His adlibs and double takes playing George-Michael on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT had already established that.  Here he demonstrates the same kind of subtle mastery he displayed on that tragically cancelled show.  He is so natural in everything he does that he doesn't seem to be acting.  I'm really interested to see where his future career takes him.  Jonah Hill was quite funny as Seth, but I found his performance to be somewhat irritating after a bit.  He starts off in a shouting fury and barely ratchets down his performance until somewhere near the end.  I laughed a lot at him, but after a while I just noticed he was starting to bug me.  This could be less Hill's fault than the director.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse was absolutely wonderful as McLovin in his acting debut.  And he was perfectly paired with Seth Rogen and Bill Halder as the two cops who want to convince him that they are cool.One really curious aspect to this film is that almost all the male actors in the film have or will shortly appear with Kristen Bell in films.  Michael Cera appeared on an episode of VERONICA MARS as a campus tour guide (and also in an episode of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT tried to entice Maebe into watching an episode of VERONICA MARS).  Both Jonah Hill and Bill Halder will appear in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, in which Kristen plays the title character.  Seth Rogen will shortly appear with Kristen in FANBOYS.  The tiny but hugely talented blonde one really does seem to be everywhere these days.",4,"Neither super nor bad, but definitely one of the funniest movies of the summer",1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,4513,"['liked', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'absolutely', 'question', 'host', 'wildly', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'raise', 'question', 'movie', 'existed', 'sake', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'sake', 'movie', 'plot', 'fact', 'close', 'nonexistent', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'story', 'irrelevant', 'What', 'plot', 'be', 'there', 'order', 'hand', 'jokes', 'think', 'what', 'degree', 'will', 'like', 'SUPERBAD', 'will', 'depend', 'movie', 'kind', 'story', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'many', 'topics', 'conversation.Personally', ""'m"", 'willing', 'forgive', 'movie', 'certain', 'hollowness', 'heart', 'sake', 'jokes', 'laughed', 'hard', 'laughed', 'often', 'film', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'number', 'flaws', 'So', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'model', 'film', 'class', 'how', 'write', 'script', 'might', 'however', 'be', 'used', 'aspiring', 'comics', 'how', 'tell', 'joke', 'story', 'such', 'concerns', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'losers', 'enamored', 'girls', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'league', 'When', 'one', 'girls', 'one', 'guys', 'fake', 'I.D', 'actually', 'boast', 'was', 'lie', 'buy', 'liquor', 'party', 'throwing', 'Most', 'movie', 'attempt', 'get', 'liquor', 'party', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'recruit', 'third', 'use', 'astonishingly', 'awful', 'fake', 'I.D', 'Hawaiian', 'D.L', 'identifying', 'McLovin', 'first', 'name', 'McLovin', 'actually', 'nerd', 'named', 'Fogell', 'separated', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'named', 'writers', 'screenplay', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'feature', 'prominently', 'film', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'when', 'attempt', 'buy', 'liquor', 'interrupted', 'robbery', 'most', 'movie', 'traveling', 'around', 'two', 'extraordinarily', 'funny', 'cops', 'Meanwhile', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'thinking', 'Fogell', 'been', 'arrested', 'police', 'determined', 'get', 'party', 'booze', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'said', 'none', 'really', 'matters', 'one', 'films', 'journey', 'not', 'destination', 'what', 'matters.This', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'bothered', 'excessive', 'obscene', 'language', 'movie', 'could', 'leave', 'feeling', 'disturbed', 'Unbelievably', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'explicit', 'discussion', 'pornography', 'sex', 'genitalia', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'graphic', 'drawings', 'male', 'genitalia', 'number', 'color', 'topics', 'F', 'word', 'used', 'excessively', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'movies', 'have', 'more', 'excessive', 'obscene', 'language', 'there', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'many', 'roughly', 'BADDER', 'SANTA', 'sheer', 'quantity', 'curse', 'words', 'So', 'be', 'forewarned', 'land', 'obscene', 'language', 'SUPERBAD', 'would', 'reign', 'king.SUPERBAD', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'cast', 'long', 'string', 'people', 'have', 'great', 'small', 'moments', 'several', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'have', 'argued', 'people', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'gifted', 'teen', 'comic', 'actor', 'ever', 'come', 'along', 'adlibs', 'double', 'playing', 'George-Michael', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'Here', 'same', 'kind', 'subtle', 'mastery', 'displayed', 'tragically', 'cancelled', 'show', 'so', 'natural', 'everything', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'acting', ""'m"", 'really', 'interested', 'see', 'where', 'future', 'career', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'Seth', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'somewhat', 'irritating', 'bit', 'off', 'shouting', 'fury', 'barely', 'ratchets', 'down', 'performance', 'somewhere', 'end', 'laughed', 'lot', 'while', 'just', 'noticed', 'was', 'starting', 'bug', 'could', 'be', 'less', 'Hill', 'fault', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'McLovin', 'acting', 'debut', 'was', 'perfectly', 'paired', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Bill', 'Halder', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'want', 'convince', 'are', 'cool.One', 'really', 'curious', 'aspect', 'film', 'almost', 'male', 'actors', 'film', 'have', 'will', 'shortly', 'appear', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'films', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'appeared', 'episode', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'campus', 'tour', 'guide', 'also', 'episode', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'tried', 'entice', 'Maebe', 'watching', 'episode', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Bill', 'Halder', 'will', 'appear', 'FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', 'Kristen', 'title', 'character', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'will', 'shortly', 'appear', 'Kristen', 'FANBOYS', 'tiny', 'hugely', 'talented', 'blonde', 'one', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'everywhere', 'days']",N/A

1112608,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000WZEZFY,Roland E. Zwick,"[40, 52]","Filmmakers Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make lowbrow comedies for highbrow audiences.  With films like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" and their current gem, ""Superbad"" (directed by Greg Mottola), they have begun, in their own quiet way, to re-write the rules of the modern sex comedy, making films that, despite their R-rated blueness, are just a tad more insightful, a little more nuanced, and a trifle more literate than most films in that genre.The characters in their movies may seem at first blush to be mere photocopies of the nerds and losers familiar to us from all those post-""Animal House,"" pandering-to-youth comedy hits of the late 1970's and 1980's.  Yet, there is something rather different about these individuals, a difference that it is not always all that easy to put one`s finger on.  They seem somehow more reflective and self-aware than their earlier counterparts, more able to step out of their skins and see themselves for who and what they are.  It's almost as if these characters have had the added advantage of seeing themselves reflected in all those earlier movies (one imagines they've spent a great deal of their childhood reveling in ""Revenge of the Nerds"") and of extracting important lessons from those films to help them chart their course through life.The storyline, in and of itself, is hardly original.  The screenplay by Rogen and Goldberg chronicles the misadventures of three teenage super geeks determined  to go to any lengths or suffer any humiliation to be part of the ""in"" crowd at school.  With only a few days left before graduation, Seth, Evan, and super-nerd Fogell - an outcast even the outcasts can feel comfortable ostracizing - decide that the time has come to take some drastic action if they hope to have any chance of losing their virginity before high school ends.  Thus, Seth cooks up a scheme to smuggle booze into a graduation party being thrown by one of the hottest girls on campus.  It is the expected setbacks they encounter as they go about the business of achieving ""coolness"" that provide the comic energy for the tale.As they did in ""Knocked Up,"" the writers capture the way people in the real world actually speak.  The dialogue may be crude and vulgar, but it is also sharply observant and wickedly funny as the characters lament the unfairness of life and reveal deep-seated concerns and feelings about themselves and each other.  What's nice is that the characters in this film not only sound like people we might encounter in everyday life but LOOK like them as well.  Even the ""beautiful"" people in this film aren't drop-dead gorgeous, just believably well put-together and attractive.Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are so authentic and convincing in the roles of Seth, Eric and Fogell, respectively, that they have us securely in their corner from the very first moment they appear on screen.  Rogen and Bill Hader (""SNL"") also have a good time playing goofy cops, although their characters aren't as finely drawn or interesting as the three main characters, and the scenes with them do tend to drag a bit.It is crucial to point out that, amidst all the blush-inducing, foul-mouthed hilarity, there's an incredible underlying sweetness to ""Superbad,"" particularly in the final two scenes of the movie.Together, this team of talented filmmakers is making it fun to go to the movies again.",4,"another triumph from the ""Knocked Up"" team",1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,3407,"['Filmmakers', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'make', 'lowbrow', 'comedies', 'highbrow', 'audiences', 'films', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'current', 'gem', 'Superbad', 'directed', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'have', 'begun', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 're-write', 'rules', 'modern', 'sex', 'comedy', 'making', 'films', 'R-rated', 'blueness', 'are', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'insightful', 'little', 'more', 'nuanced', 'trifle', 'more', 'literate', 'most', 'films', 'genre.The', 'characters', 'movies', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'blush', 'be', 'mere', 'photocopies', 'nerds', 'losers', 'familiar', 'post-', 'Animal', 'House', 'pandering-to-youth', 'comedy', 'hits', 'late', '1970', '1980', 'something', 'rather', 'different', 'individuals', 'difference', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'put', 'one', 's', 'finger', 'seem', 'somehow', 'more', 'reflective', 'self-aware', 'earlier', 'counterparts', 'more', 'able', 'step', 'out', 'skins', 'see', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'almost', 'characters', 'have', 'had', 'added', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'reflected', 'earlier', 'movies', 'one', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'childhood', 'reveling', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'extracting', 'important', 'lessons', 'films', 'help', 'chart', 'course', 'life.The', 'storyline', 'hardly', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Rogen', 'Goldberg', 'misadventures', 'three', 'teenage', 'super', 'geeks', 'determined', 'go', 'lengths', 'suffer', 'humiliation', 'be', 'part', 'crowd', 'school', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'left', 'graduation', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'super-nerd', 'Fogell', 'outcast', 'even', 'outcasts', 'can', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'ostracizing', 'decide', 'time', 'come', 'take', 'drastic', 'action', 'hope', 'have', 'chance', 'losing', 'virginity', 'high', 'school', 'ends', 'Thus', 'Seth', 'up', 'scheme', 'smuggle', 'booze', 'graduation', 'party', 'being', 'thrown', 'one', 'hottest', 'girls', 'campus', 'expected', 'setbacks', 'encounter', 'go', 'business', 'achieving', 'coolness', 'provide', 'comic', 'energy', 'tale.As', 'did', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'writers', 'capture', 'way', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'speak', 'dialogue', 'may', 'be', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'also', 'sharply', 'observant', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'characters', 'lament', 'unfairness', 'life', 'reveal', 'deep-seated', 'concerns', 'feelings', 'other', 'What', 'nice', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'sound', 'people', 'might', 'encounter', 'everyday', 'life', 'LOOK', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'people', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'just', 'believably', 'well', 'put-together', 'attractive.Jonah', 'Hill', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'are', 'so', 'authentic', 'convincing', 'roles', 'Seth', 'Eric', 'Fogell', 'respectively', 'have', 'securely', 'corner', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'appear', 'screen', 'Rogen', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'SNL', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'goofy', 'cops', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'finely', 'drawn', 'interesting', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'scenes', 'do', 'tend', 'drag', 'bit.It', 'crucial', 'point', 'out', 'amidst', 'blush-inducing', 'foul-mouthed', 'hilarity', 'incredible', 'underlying', 'sweetness', 'Superbad', 'particularly', 'final', 'two', 'scenes', 'movie.Together', 'team', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'fun', 'go', 'movies', 'again']",N/A

This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past few years.The one factor that made this movie roll to success was the incredible on screen chemistry between Jonah Hill (Seth) and Michael Cera (Evan). They made the movie believable, and their interaction, especially the one-on-one conversations and playing off each other's reactions was, to say the least, phenomenal.  Chris Mintz-Plasse (Fogell) was probably one of the best supporting characters I've ever seen in a comedy.  His story revolved around his encounter with police officers who were desperate to prove that cops can ""be cool too."" This combination produced some of the best one-liners you'll hear at the movies, or in my friend's words, ""the quotables.""The story evolves over the course of one day as Seth, Evan and Fogell go to lengths to make a name for themselves in the final weeks of their underachieved high school careers. Each has their own personal love interest and their own strategy of impressing the girl. As the story evolves, comedy and sentiment each take their role in a plot which ultimately provides the perfect mixture and a fun time in any atmosphere.

So many stupid films in this genre, such as American Pie and its sequels, made me think twice before going to see this one.  I'm glad I decided to chance it.

1112614,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000WZEZFY,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","Greg Mottola's ""Superbad,"" co-written by Judd Apatow alums Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, goes into the hallowed pantheon of great teen-angst comedies like ""16 Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""American Pie.""  A lot of filmmakers make ""teen movies"" by throwing some T&A; together with some hijinx, but most forget the heart.  ""Superbad"" has heart, in spades.The movie focuses on the relationship between two fast friends, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera, of ""Arrested Development"" fame).  They are rising seniors and have been best friends for years, they are destined to split up soon.  Evan is Dartmouth-bound, while it looks like Seth is fated to go to a safety-school, at best.  Even worse for Seth, Evan is heading to Dartmouth with their perpetual third-wheel, the uber-nerd Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).By reinforcing each other during the desperate teen years, the profane Seth and the ultra-sensitive Evan remain virgins, the plot of the movie loosely follows their quest to leave that club before graduation.  But before your cliche-meter goes to 11, fear not.  ""Superbad"" is far too intelligent to lapse too deeply into plots we've seen before - this movie transcends them.  Only in a movie this smart can a nerd like Fogell build his self-esteem by bragging to his friends that he told a hot chick ""what time it was"" when he actually said ""It's 10:30.""The movie mainly takes place during one day toward the end of the school year when our three amigos try to buy booze for a serious high-school party, where each hopes to meet the girl drunk enough to make a mistake by sleeping with them.  What ensues is a crazy romp with stoners, drunks, chicks, and two of the coolest cops you'll ever hope to meet.At the end of the day, the three guys learn important lessons about friendship, girls, and growing up, but the viewer is mercifully spared from being hit over the head too hard.  The movie has surprises and laughs galore, and it goes without saying that ""McLovin"" is as hip a catch-phrase as ""Vote for Pedro"" ever was.If you need a laugh, check it out.  Full disclosure - we watched the rated version, and it had plenty of raunch and profanity to suit our regressive brains just fine, thank you very much.",5,"""Superbad"" goes into the pantheon of great teen-angst flicks",1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,2235,"['Greg', 'Mottola', 'Superbad', 'co-written', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'alums', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'hallowed', 'pantheon', 'great', 'teen-angst', 'comedies', '16', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'American', 'Pie', 'lot', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'teen', 'movies', 'throwing', 'T', 'A', 'together', 'hijinx', 'most', 'forget', 'heart', 'Superbad', 'heart', 'spades.The', 'movie', 'relationship', 'two', 'fast', 'friends', 'Seth', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Evan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'fame', 'are', 'rising', 'seniors', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'years', 'are', 'destined', 'split', 'up', 'soon', 'Evan', 'Dartmouth-bound', 'Seth', 'fated', 'go', 'safety-school', 'best', 'Even', 'worse', 'Seth', 'Evan', 'heading', 'Dartmouth', 'perpetual', 'third-wheel', 'uber-nerd', 'Fogell', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', '.By', 'reinforcing', 'other', 'desperate', 'teen', 'years', 'profane', 'Seth', 'ultra-sensitive', 'Evan', 'remain', 'virgins', 'plot', 'movie', 'loosely', 'quest', 'leave', 'club', 'graduation', 'cliche-meter', '11', 'fear', 'not', 'Superbad', 'far', 'too', 'intelligent', 'lapse', 'too', 'deeply', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Only', 'movie', 'smart', 'can', 'nerd', 'Fogell', 'build', 'self-esteem', 'bragging', 'friends', 'told', 'hot', 'chick', 'what', 'time', 'was', 'when', 'actually', 'said', '10:30', 'movie', 'mainly', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'when', 'three', 'amigos', 'try', 'buy', 'booze', 'serious', 'high-school', 'party', 'where', 'meet', 'girl', 'drunk', 'enough', 'make', 'mistake', 'sleeping', 'What', 'crazy', 'romp', 'stoners', 'drunks', 'chicks', 'two', 'coolest', 'cops', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hope', 'meet.At', 'end', 'day', 'three', 'guys', 'learn', 'important', 'lessons', 'friendship', 'girls', 'growing', 'up', 'viewer', 'mercifully', 'spared', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'surprises', 'galore', 'saying', 'McLovin', 'hip', 'catch-phrase', 'Vote', 'Pedro', 'ever', 'need', 'laugh', 'check', 'out', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'watched', 'rated', 'version', 'had', 'plenty', 'raunch', 'profanity', 'suit', 'regressive', 'brains', 'just', 'fine', 'thank', 'very', 'much']",N/A

This film is unrepentantly profane, i mean like WOW profane. I cannot belive kids talk like this and use THIS much of swear words. ( i am old, yes. prude maybe.) and are one dimensional to everything else in the world regarding sex. So i would not recommend this for kids, but for mid twenty somethings who get a kick of what high school life was once.Far from this being an 'oprah level' analysis of values in today's world, the movie itself should be viewed as light hearted and a story of friendship between three teens, one who has a fake ID to buy alcohol, and the other two trying to get laid at a party.I still feel its very profane and explicit in certain areas, but when you back all that up with a good script and laugh-out-loud dialog delivery, its worth seeing.Enjoyp.s: The 70s funk soundtrack was a killer touch to this movie, very innovative.

1112626,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000WZEZFY,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[5, 5]","This film, while crass, is at the same time mostly brilliant.  First of all, the authentic sounding, modern-teen phrasing and unfailing verbal wit the writers put into the mouths of the nerdy characters Seth, Evan, and Fogell deserve high praise, no matter how raunchy some commentators might find such. Second, although Freud, after a lifetime of study, and at the end of a very long book, finally threw up his hands in despair,it is reported, asking ""What do women want?"", he might, as Germaine Greer once suggested, have issued just a small pamphlet with an embarrassingly obvious answer to the question of what men (and by extension teenage boys such as those here) want. This perception is pretty much the takeoff point for ""Superbad,"" though still even here some genre-tweaking complexity is introduced, since Evan is allowed to play a comparatively restrained, ethical gentleman to Seth's super hungry teen. Added to this memorable duo of guys is the remarkable super-nerdy Fogell, freshman actor Mintz-Plasse in an undeniably bravura, consistently scene-stealing turn.In short, the writers deserve praise for having taken a largely overworked, mediocre genre, the teen comedy, and elevated it in the direction of actual art by transcending its usual limitations not only through zippy dialogue but also through enriched, diverse, and therefore believable character types. In short, ""High School Musical,"" I'm happy to say, this film most definitely is not.The film has a key weakness , though, which robs it for my money of a 5 star classification. It is the weakness which appears glaringly in the sequences involving the two police officers. They don't exist, unfortunately, on the same level of reality or probability as the 3 central teens, and though some of their lines are truly funny, their actions pretty much throughout strain credibility in a way nothing else in the film does.

1112630,A31M2QHES2IMB,B000WZEZFY,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[0, 0]","Superbad is crude.  The dialog is shocking and in bad taste.  However, it's perfectly realistic.  Anyone who says it's not is lying to themselves.  And that's what makes it so funny.  The plot is simple.  Teenage boys trying to use a fake id to get alcohol to get themselves into a party as their last year of high school is coming to a close.  But it takes that simple beginning and is able to spin plenty of outlandish situations from it.Our protagonists Evan and Seth have been best friends for over 10 years but are now facing the dilemma of moving on to separate colleges without each other.  They are polar opposites.  While Seth is a complete jerk and has no qualms about getting a girl drunk enough to sleep with him, Evan is the moral compass of the two and is awkward when it comes to dealing with his crush.  So even though many may just brush this off as a teen comedy about trying to get alcohol and lose your virginity, there's a bit more to it than meets the eye as Evan and Seth struggle with growing up and the prospect of leaving each other behind knowing life will never be the same after the summer ends.The acting is what you would expect from an Apatow produced comedy (and I'm talking F&G;/Knocked Up here, not Anchorman, Talladega Nights) but it's really the dialog that sets it apart from most generic teen comedies.  It really rang true with me, knowing this is how teens talk, never holding back.  Seth Rogan along with pal Evan Goldberg were responsible for the script and Rogan even wrote himself a role in there as a poor excuse for a cop.  The direction by Greg Mottola worked well with the tone of the movie and the comic timing was on.  Mottola having graduated from the Arrested Development school of directing (he was responsible for the casting of Michael Cera, AD's George Michael).As far as the ""Unrated"" tag goes, I did notice a few added lines here and there, but nothing that I would have deemed too racy to be shown in the theaters.  You're basically just getting the uncut version here.  I was honestly expecting to see some nudity, (shouldn't every hard R teen comedybe required to show some skin?) but alas I couldn't see anything about this version that warranted it being unrated.

The one thing about the movies with the lovable dorky guys in high school are to make them seem, well likeable, as the cool kids treat them like crap, and they wind up coming out on top at the end, the thing about Superbad, I didn't find the characters likeable at all, Seth was nothing more than a foul mouth vulgar jerk, and Evan lacked any real depth. The scene stealing Fogell character had some laughs, but that was about it.Another thing is these characters existed in some weird fantasy world, where the cool kids were only the boys, who treated them like crap, but the hot girls they were interested in, well they were really nice, and liked them back, man, where was this high school at? What I remember cool kids both male and female treated the un-cool kids horrible, and wouldn't give them the time of day,so this aspect in the film of the hot girls being really great to our loveable loser heros, laughable in the way it's not at all plausible in the least. And the adults in this film (cops,convience store cashiere etc) being total morons,okay right.And I find no comparison to this film with Revenge of the Nerds, that film actually pretty much depicted how the so called ""Geeks, Nerds and Losers"" were treated, and one of the main characters ending up with the snotty popular cheerleader was at least possible.

1112638,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000WZEZFY,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[2, 5]","Perhaps one of the most appropriately named movies to come out on DVD in the recent past,  Superbad lives up to its name in terms of quality but affords the viewer a few times where laughter is all but certain. The film is a raunchy and tasteless comedy that centers upon the trials and tribulations of a few high school students simply looking to transcend adolescence and enter adulthood. However, their trip is not through SATs and college entrance exams, rather it is through the hopes and dreams of landing that perfect babe in the bed one high school night.The movie highlights the lives of two basic high school guys who have shared their adolescent and childhood years together as best friends. Though not the most popular kids in the school, they are your typical high school students looking to party, hang around with each other, talk shop about girls and always stray away from asking that special girl out on a date.Seth (Jonah Hill) is a pudgy wannabe party animal ala Horatio Sans on Saturday Night Live. It is apparent that Seth concerns himself more with fitting in with the ""in-crowd"" than does his best friend, Evan (Michael Cera).Comic relief throughout the film is provided thanks in part to Seth and Evan's quirky friendship with Foggell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Foggell, although about as nerdy and suburban white as one could get assumes an alter-ego that fuels his self-confidence when by all accounts he should probably stick to his true persona.After being invited to an end of the year party by the untouchable girl of his dreams (Emma Hill), Seth embarks on a mission to score booze to impress his crush in hopes of ending his high school career with a bang. Though Foggell's attempts to score booze pay off momentarily, when he is taken by two completely ridiculous police officers (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) Foggell is temporarily out of commission and instead a party to the hilarity of the officers' wild times of booze, guns and prisoners passed out in the back seat.Eventually Seth does indeed score some of the required booze and gets to the party just in time to become the savior of the party thanks to his ability to score some liquor. Though each one of the boys come impressively close to in fact sealing the deal on their initial hopes for the end of the school year, for one reason or another each one comes up short and unable to complete the task at hand.The ending of the movie is a bit too romantically out of place for the rest of the film. Seth and Evan perhaps release the error of their ways and instead ride off into the sunset with a respectful take on the women in their lives. Though this might be the ultimate goal of any good relationship, the rest of the film warrants a much more bizarre and wild ending. It seems as though the ending to this film does not pair well with the rest of the movie.While the movie does maintain a few good chuckles time and time again, the movie overall is a pretty poor viewing. The film seems almost too much like every other film in its genre and really lacks the out of the ordinary that could have made this film better. Rather, Superbad is a banal attempt at simply doing what has already been done and falls short in both the humor and originality factor.Certainly, based upon the entire premise of the movie and the topic at hand, the humor in this film is crass and tasteless and the language centers around vulgarity perhaps more than some other films. For these reasons, this film is not for children or the faint of heart.

1112639,A24L13Q1GJAS6U,B000WZEZFY,"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots""","[8, 34]","I STILL hate this movie, some time after I've seen it. You must also comprehend that I hate you, the viewer, if you should errantly enjoy or find yourself amused by Superbad. Do you fit this definition--well, do you, punk? Then, I hate you as much as I hate Superbad!!!!I'm not a socio/psychopath who hates for hate itself (like Dems hating Bush for the sake of hatred of his very values as a person). When I hate, I have excessively well-founded reason to do so, and Superbad brings out righteous feelings of hatred!!!! I, with unadulterated hatred (say, like the Palis hate Jews), hate Superbad because of its most mortal of mistakes: it confuses lowbrow, unclean immaturity with real comedy! Apatow is particularly afflicted with this emotional/moral illness as ALL of his movies perpetrate this confusion of comedy versus distastefulness.Like the epitome of anti-social debauchery that one finds with the criminally insane, Superbad unrepentantly uses gross-out ""jokes"" instead of wits for comedy; abuses indecent suggestiveness in place of well-timed gags; and misuses lowlife swearing and cussing of the most vulgar nature as substitutes for intelligent dialogue. In Superbad's world--which I KNOW 100% is targeted exclusively to and patronized by sophomoric high-school and college kids (and also developmentally retarded adults who depravedly refused to ""grow up""--everything profane is celebrated as funny; everything indelicate is feted as smart; and everything disrespectful is put up on a pedestal as cool behavior that should be imitated.I'll now go into cold, hard, specific examples of the lowlife obscenities in Superbad that will mortify ALL of the mislead souls who doubtfully found this movie ""funny"" before. This will likely be an agonizing self-examination for many of them because I will throw in their faces the ethical shortcomings of this trash film. And, after this harshly thorough expose of mine, many would-be viewers of this film (not exactly dreadful people, but just suggestible sheeple) will hopefully be deterred from watching this cr*p. Other activities that make for better time spent than watching Superbad include going to Church, reading, volunteering time for community service, educating some liberals, and even picking your nose (see, with nose-picking, at least you don't confuse vulgarity with comedy!).Since the plot of this superficially dissolute film is three, undersexed, high-school nerds illegally buy alcohol with which to lower the inhibitions of teen girls (probably to then date-rape them!), it's no shock infamous scenes include:1)  Underage drinking by high-school tykes at a hedonistic party where Becca's said to be smashed and about to ""bl*w"" (did you know bl*w in this context means oral sex??) Evan that very night! This segues to Evan drinking lots while saying to himself about Becca, ""She wants to suck your Buster McThunderstick (this means p*nis in this context!).""My morally clear analysis is this scene defies humor; instead, it tempts unvirtuous, liberal teens into hurting themselves through drunkenness, risky sexual misbehavior, and misjudging that one has to measure himself by the frequency of sexual encounters!!!!2)  Seth and Evan talk about porn sites (activity of all developmentally retarded males) including ""Vagastic Voyages""; there's braggadocio about banging (in this context, it means copulating!) women in vans, of a site showing people urinating on each other, (animalistic fetishes), and Seth whining about one that refuses to show ""d*cks going in.""My morally clear analysis is this scene comes short of humor or anything else noteworthy; instead, it encourages h*rny, sexually depraved, male teens to satisfy their lusts by going on online porn sites and m*sturbating along to simulated sex!!!!3)  Seth salivates at the sight of Evan's mom's cleavage. He tells Evan he's jealous that Evan was able to suck her br*asts when still a baby. Then, Evan gives an allegedly sharp retort of role-reversal, sarcastically informing Seth that Seth used to suck on his father's ""V*ginal Depth Detector (in this context, it means p*nis!).""My morally clear analysis is this scene rejects humor; instead, it sacrilegiously disrespects the beautiful role of mothers and fathers in normal, non-alternative families by misapplying contexts of lust and sm*t to Seth's mom and Evan's dad.4)  Barely clothed teen-sl*t Nicola's on top of Fogell who exlaims, ""I've got a b*ner (in this context, it means er*ction!),"" while Nicola breaks out lubricant (increases the smoothness of sexual thrusting)! As Fogell's on top of Nicola, he announces, ""It's in (he means his V*ginal Depth Detector, for those who failed Anatomy 101)!"" Confusingly, cops burst in and one asks Fogell if he was ""violating that girl with your Hairy Snake and the Two Bald Men (again, it means p*nis)?"" His partner adds, ""I'm really sorry I blocked your c*ck (not the rooster, but it refers to his p*nis)!""My morally clear analysis is this scene isn't laugh-inducing; instead it, desecrates the intimate, private and ideally unselfish experience of sex through the lust of Nicola and Fogell and the intrusion of the police.These four, notorious examples are merely the tip of the iceberg, but Superbad's overflowing with this societal poison throughout.I must now righteously chastise two demographics whose silence in condemning pollution like Superbad is deafening. Where are females in denouncing this sm*t-movie? Superbad singularly demeans girls as objects of lusts to be hunted down, plied with liquor, then penetrated for male lust!!!! I cannot believe women aren't writing censuring reviews. Parents had better know their impressionable and easily tempted teen sons are likely dying to see this , so they'd better police their kids more furiously!!!! Blast said parents who aren't writing scolding reviews rebuking this film.",1,"This Movie is SO Vile, Studios originally thought of titling it ""Supers*itty,"" ""Supersuckage,"" and even

Unlikable and undefined characters.  Endless meandering in place of story.  If watching the actual movie isn't embarrassing enough for you, check out the ""table reading"" extra where the actors do a read-thru of the script.  Ugh.  Just painful.  I'm absolutely sure that the actors had more fun reading that script than any paying person in the theatre (at least they were getting paid to go with it).The cop characters?  Not only do these characters not exist in any form of reality, they don't even exist in any movie scenario.  There isn't one believable moment with them.  And they're not even funny.  They make the POLICE ACADEMY flunkies look like Shakespeare.The language is consistently crude without any shred of credibility.  By that I mean: everyone sounds the same.

1112642,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000WZEZFY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 7]","""Superbad"" is an extremely funny movie. Is it as good as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" or ""Knocked Up"", the other films Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen have been involved in? No. But it is a very funny film with just a few slight flaws.Seth (Jonah Hill, ""Knocked Up"") and Evan (Michael Cera, TV's ""Arrested Development"") have two more weeks of high school before the summer and then they are off to college. Evan was accepted to Dartmouth, Seth was not, so this is their last summer together. They also feel it is their last chance to get laid and each has set their sights on a highly improbable conquest; Seth has his eyes for Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and Evan is very attracted to Jules (Emma Stone). Both guys are surprised and very excited to be invited to a party Becca is throwing at her house, her parents have gone away and she is anxious to have a lot of friends over. Her eyes light up when Seth says he can bring alcohol. Evan agrees to bring a bottle of Goldslick Vodka for Jules, her favorite drink and he is eager to do anything for her that might earn him some points. The only problem? They aren't old enough to buy alcohol. Then Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plattes), a nerdy friend who they really tolerate more than anything, brags he will be picking up a fake ID that afternoon. Their problems are solved. That afternoon, they learn Fogel has purchased a Hawaiian driver's license with the name ""McLovin"". They decide to go ahead with the plan anyway and McLovin enters a liquor store. While there, the store is robbed and McLovin meets the two cops, Officer Slater (Bill Hader, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") and Officer Michaels (Seth Rogen, ""Knocked Up""), who answer the call. During the evening, all of these characters cross paths leading to some memorable, very funny adventures.Seth Rogen and his friend Evan Goldberg apparently wrote ""Superbad"" when they were both teenagers. Now that Rogen is enjoying increased popularity and visibility due to roles in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", he and Judd Apatow, director of Rogen's last two films and producer of ""Superbad"" were able to get this project made.""Superbad"" tells the story of two teenagers who are desperate to have sex for the first time. One is skinny and a little geeky. The other is overweight and has an unfortunate hairstyle. Neither is the football hero or the class jock, so they feel they have an inherent impediment to this goal. But that doesn't stop them from constantly thinking about, talking about or trying to have sex.Each is surprised when the object of their affection seems to be at least partially interested in talking, or getting to know one another. And they try to muddle through the conversations. Because Seth and Evan are primarily interested in having sex, they use language that may shock some consistently and casually, like many teenagers do. But it is more funny because we realize perhaps we talked like this when we were there age, when all of this was new and slightly strange and we tried to verbalize all of these new feelings with language we think makes us seem more adult and interesting.""Superbad"" has all of the markings of any of the terrible teen sex comedies released in the last decade. So why is it better than these other films? Even though the two guys are on a singular quest, and use raunchy language, they are also both intelligent and change over the course of the film. Yes, they are consumed with the idea of having sex, but they also realize the girls who are the object of their affections have feelings and they take these into consideration. When Seth makes a mistake, and Becca corrects him, he realizes his mistake and is actually remorseful. He isn't sure how to handle his moment, so he walks away. Later, when he meets Becca again by accident, he realizes she isn't holding the mistake against him. Perhaps there is some hope for a relationship.Evan is just the opposite. He is less sure about his `abilities' and their plan than Seth. But there is a moment when he realizes that Jules is drunk and he shouldn't continue. He doesn't want to achieve this goal by making out with a drunken girl, so he holds back, even if it means he will remain a virgin for that much longer. It is a nice moment because it helps to show that he will grow up to be a fine young man.Fogel is the nerdy guy they tolerate because they don't exactly have a wealth of friends to choose from. Christopher Mintz-Plattes plays Fogel and he will probably be the most enduring element of the film. When Fogel announces he is going to buy a fake ID, Seth and Evan brush the idea off, just another one of Fogel's crazy plans. Then Becca and Jules give them details about the upcoming party and they realize Fogel can help them become the heroes of the party. When they meet Fogel, and look at his new ID, they realize they shouldn't have placed all of their hopes in their friend. His new ID, from Hawaii, lists his name as ""McLovin"", a 25-year-old organ donor from the 50th state. They are amazed at Fogel's inability to see how this ID could be problematic. But they are stuck and need to move forward with the plan.Mintz-Plattes is very good. Many actors his age would tend to play the roles very broad, yelling and screaming their lines, making their roles little more convincing than a cartoon character. Mintz-Plattes plays the role in a very normal way, making the character seem like a fairly normal teenager; he is full of bravado at times, but also humble enough to know when he should be quiet. He also has the strangest journey of all of the three characters. It is a fun, interesting and fairly unique character.That is not to say that both Seth and Evan aren't funny or memorable. Jonah Hill plays Seth, the role Rogen wrote based on his own adventures. Jonah's Seth is the more hyperactive of the two and the most desperate to lose his virginity. He is funny and interesting and seems to have a lot of talent. The film depicts a couple of moments in their development and Seth narrates one of these. When he starts talking about the event, it seems odd at first but the story continues and gets stranger and stranger. It is a great illustration of why these characters are so obsessed with the thought of losing their virginity.During the course of the evening, he and Evan end up at a party filled with adults. Seth ends up dancing with a woman and has a memorable experience. The scene is meant to shock us and provide a memorable moment, much like the sight of Jason Bigg's with an apple pie plastered to his groin. But there is a significant difference between the two. In ""American Pie"", the scene is fully integrated into the overall fabric of the story. The scene in ""Superbad"" seems more of an anomaly than a piece of the story and doesn't fit as neatly.Evan is the more intelligent, but less demonstrative member of the duo. He goes along with a lot of what Seth says and decides. But he does have a mind and will of his own and manages to have his own moments. There is a funny scene early on when he is walking down a hallway at his school and realizes Jules is walking in front of him. She turns and catches him looking at her, yet decides to talk to him. Evan raises his hand and someone bumps into him, causing his hand to touch her breast. Mortified, he tries to explain, but she realizes what happened and doesn't think a lot of it.""Superbad"" has a lot going for it. It is extremely funny, the acting is good and it is a great addition to the summer.

Two high school kids have 24 hours to get laid before they separate for college, and maybe forever. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play the two misfits trying desperately to score the booze that they feel will be their key to the cool, final party with the girls of their dreams.Of course, this could not possibly go right, so Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) are forced to recruit the movie stealing Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the new model-geek of Michael Anthony Hall inSixteen Candles) and his fake ID. A series of hilarious and profane accidents carry the movie at lightning speed. The three teenagers stumble from one mess to another, including one of the funniest gross-outs ever to make it to a comedy.The really cool thing about ""Superbad"" is, no matter how hapless or feckless these three kids are, they are never mean-spirited, but they are your typically hormonally challenged 17 year olds with the standard obsessions. Apatow just takes them and magnifies them way beyond actual size, with the exaggeration the prime source of the silliness. This is a movie that hardly has a dragging spot, and even with the mass quantities of four letter words and the hyper-kinetic pace, the ""Superbad"" keeps the sentimental core intact.Extra kudos go to the support cast, especially Seth Rogan and Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader as the police officers who come off moreSuper TroopersthanAdam-12. They give Fogell his rites-of-passage and turn him from victim to victor by the movie's end.

All this guy does when he's not standing there with a blank look on his face is moaning and complaining about everything that goes on around him.  That's his character...a whiner who groans about everything and is not remotely amusing when he's doing it.Let's add in a couple of cops who are trying to impress another teenager by showing him how cool they are doing their job.  Getting drunk at a bar, driving and then running into Jonah Hill with their cruiser.  Ha Ha Ha.  That's some great comedy right there.  I might have given this another half star if Hill actually didn't get up or was hurt so badly he couldn't talk the remainder of the film, no such luck.The basic premise of the movie is boys want to sleep with girls they like in high school and are trying to buy alcohol for the end of the school year party.  That's good...it's an automatic money machine for teenagers everywhere.  I just can't imagine how so many people gave this favorable reviews when there's one funny moment in the entire movie (at a bar when they loop a videotape of a kid getting clocked in the jaw).It's not funny at all.

1112649,A3T8QNAEQ4SW7R,B000WZEZFY,Vain Saints,"[6, 12]","Just kinda bad.  I thought that Seth and Evan could have played their characters with a bit more stylistic range.  Cera plays the same character he plays in Arrested Development.  George Michael Bluth, put in these situations, would have responded in the exact same way.  Seth just yells way too much.  A different take once in awhile would be nice.There are some good stuff here.  The lead characters are believable, despite being monochromatic.  They are relatable, despite not being likable (in Seth's case at least).  There is a good gag with McLuvin.But then I noticed: that's where it ends.  After that, there is nothing but problems here.The movie essentially ceases to be a comedy after the cops take McLuvin for a wild ride.  It then becomes a standard coming-of-age drama with a lot of filthy language.  The few attempts at jokes I recall from the film after the first 20 mins. are uniformly terrible: ""Prepare to be f-d by the long d-k of the law"". That's not funny.  At all.Second, the cops are wildly incoherent as characters.  They show themselves throughout the film to be criminally incompetent, criminally negligent, criminally abusive, criminally contemptuous of their work, and, finally, outright criminals.  They assault kids out of spite and once seriously attempted to frame the two leads, fraudulently accusing them of vagrancy, to save their incompetent skins.  Then at the end of the film, they somehow are depicted as understanding and sympathetic???  I was literally hoping that the wretches would die in the car fire at the end of the film.  No such luck.Third, the plot wraps up far, far too nicely.  It's okay to have Seth redeem himself by saving his friend.  It's not okay to have his dream girl fall for him after he's been nothing but a selfish jerk, including to her.  When he brutishly stuck his face for a kiss, it should have been his lesson right there, because no woman would fall for a fat geek who acts like a tool.  Drunk or not;bought beer or not.  Seth all but admits that he was trying to get her drunk because he knew that she would never go for him sober.  That's almost an admission of attempted sexual assault, as well as an admission of self-loathing.  Women love that from the fatties. Uh huh.  I'm happy that McLuvin got his share.In short, this is a mediocre coming of age movie with a bad ending and annoying foul language, as well as inscrutable, unlikable characters.

But, seeing Seth Rogen involved in the project (40 year old virgin, Knocked Up), I felt I should see it anyway. Great Idea. A ""coming of age"" movie of sorts.  Although outlandish at times, just funny as heck.  I couldn't stop laughing.

1112654,AP3B615GM191G,B000WZEZFY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 12]","After watching such great movies as ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""The Help"", I recently became a huge fan of actress Emma Stone.  As such, I decided to go back in a time a bit to see what other movies she had done.  I watched ""Easy A"" and still was impressed, so I decided to take a gander at ""Superbad"", as I am up for a ""teen loser comedy"" every once in awhile.  The verdict?  A complete and utter waste of time.For a basic plot summary, ""Superbad"" sees two teenage losers played by Michael Cera & Jonah Hill trying to party it up together one last time before heading to different colleges after graduation.  Typical teen hijinks involving sex, drugs, alcohol, and cops ensue.The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't add anything new to its genre.  There is nothing I saw here that I haven't seen in other similar flicks.  While it is billed as ""from the creators of Knocked Up & The 40 Year Old Virgin"", this film can't hold a candle to either of those efforts.  It is extremely vulgar, incredibly crude, and the jokes really aren't even all that funny.  At it's core, this is a gross-out movie trying to pass itself off as something more (which it isn't).Thus, if you came here for Emma Stone (like I did), it isn't worth it in the slightest.  Go watch her couple of scenes in the movie on YouTube and forget about it.  You'll be much better off not wasting your time.",1,If You're Here For Emma Stone: It's Not Worth It,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,1374,"['watching', 'such', 'great', 'movies', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'Help', 'recently', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'actress', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'such', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'bit', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'movies', 'had', 'done', 'watched', 'Easy', 'A', 'still', 'was', 'impressed', 'decided', 'take', 'gander', 'Superbad', 'am', 'up', 'teen', 'loser', 'comedy', 'once', 'awhile', 'verdict', 'complete', 'utter', 'waste', 'time.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Superbad', 'two', 'teenage', 'losers', 'played', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'trying', 'party', 'up', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'heading', 'different', 'colleges', 'graduation', 'Typical', 'teen', 'hijinks', 'involving', 'sex', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'ensue.The', 'trouble', 'movie', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'genre', 'nothing', 'saw', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'similar', 'flicks', 'billed', 'creators', 'Knocked', 'Up', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'efforts', 'extremely', 'vulgar', 'incredibly', 'crude', 'jokes', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'core', 'gross-out', 'movie', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'something', 'more', ""n't"", '.Thus', 'came', 'here', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'did', ""n't"", 'worth', 'slightest', 'Go', 'couple', 'scenes', 'movie', 'YouTube', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'not', 'wasting', 'time']",N/A
