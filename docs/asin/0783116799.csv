I'm thrilled that I found and watched it.It's an enthralling dissection of America's witness protection program and what it must be like for families who are thrown into it for giving damaging testimony against powerful and ruthless killers. Yes, the ""squealers"" get to live, but at what cost to them and their loved ones, who are forced to erase the very essence of who they are and who they had hoped to become?The acting is superb. The storyline is riveting.

The acting is fantastic, even down to the little 8 year old daughter. I mean it doesnt leave anything out or candycoat the experience of entering the witness protection program. Its heartbraking at times I think, I dont know I cant explain it you know when you see someone that gets themself really embarrassed in front of a lot of people? Or when someones facad of coolness or strength suddenly gets broken down in front of strangers? And you kind of cringe when you see it cause we all have skeletons in the closet, we all think ""man, that could be me."" Watching the really strong parts of this movie are a lot like that. This tough crime boss suddenly becomes like a quivering child as hes' against the wall in the movie, trying to decide how to continue on with his family. The wife, too...Her prissyness and rich-housewifeness gets torn away as she realizes the life they were living is really gone. In the end, they have to become the 'great-American' honest family cause its the only way they can survive...And had they not entered the witness protection program, who knows how they mayve ended up. Thats another good thing about the movie, besides it being very well-acted and excellently written...It really has no ending.

43983,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0783116799,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","This 1992 HBO film dealt with a subject that has always fascinated me and yet I knew little about.  What happens to a family that goes into the witness protection program?  What kind of problems do they face?  And how, exactly, does the transformation work.  This film attempts to answer some of these questions.  And, if the characters are a little larger than life, and the story sometimes dips to the level of a soap opera, it really didn't matter to me.  Because by then, I was so involved with the story and the personalities of this particular fictional family that I was too caught up to care.The story starts out strong and continues its hectic pace. We soon learn that Tom Sizemore is involved with the mob who are out to kill him.  It becomes apparent that his wife and children are also in danger. That's when Tom Sizemore goes to the FBI and agrees to testify in exchange for his family's protection.The teenage son who is doing so well is school that he could get into a prestigious college is heartbroken.  He has to leave his girlfriend too.  And give up what looks like his whole future.  The little 5-year old girl has to learn to lie about her name.  And the wife, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, has to give up all the luxuries she's become adjusted to.  This family is going to be poor in their new location and the father is going to have to work as a laborer.This change doesn't happen overnight however.  First, the family must spend 5 days in an FBI relocation house which looks like a house but is really a fancy prison.  Here, they have to learn how to behave in their new environment.  Forest Whitiker is cast as the FBI agent who will help make this happen.  He plays his ""tough love"" part well and keeps saying he doesn't care.  But it is clear that he does care about this family.There are arguments between the husband and wife and one scene where the dishes fly and she hits him with a frying pan.  There is one scene where the son refuses to go along with the relocation.  The little girl cries a lot and we wonder how this will all affect her little life.  Tensions do more than mount.  They explode.  And there were times that my own emotions were touched and I found my eyes tearing up.I enjoyed this film and its unique angle on what the witness protection program means in the lives of one particular family.  It made me think.",5,Transition into the witness protection program isn't easy,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2362,"['1992', 'HBO', 'film', 'dealt', 'subject', 'always', 'fascinated', 'yet', 'knew', 'little', 'about', 'What', 'family', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'What', 'kind', 'problems', 'do', 'face', 'how', 'exactly', 'transformation', 'work', 'film', 'answer', 'questions', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'larger', 'life', 'story', 'sometimes', 'level', 'soap', 'opera', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'then', 'was', 'so', 'involved', 'story', 'personalities', 'particular', 'fictional', 'family', 'was', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'care.The', 'story', 'out', 'strong', 'hectic', 'pace', 'soon', 'learn', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'involved', 'mob', 'who', 'are', 'kill', 'apparent', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'danger', 'when', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'FBI', 'testify', 'exchange', 'family', 'protection.The', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'school', 'could', 'get', 'prestigious', 'college', 'heartbroken', 'leave', 'girlfriend', 'too', 'give', 'up', 'what', 'whole', 'future', 'little', '5-year', 'old', 'girl', 'learn', 'lie', 'name', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'give', 'up', 'luxuries', 'become', 'adjusted', 'family', 'going', 'be', 'poor', 'new', 'location', 'father', 'going', 'have', 'work', 'laborer.This', 'change', ""n't"", 'happen', 'overnight', 'however', 'First', 'family', 'must', 'spend', '5', 'days', 'FBI', 'relocation', 'house', 'house', 'really', 'fancy', 'prison', 'Here', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'behave', 'new', 'environment', 'Forest', 'Whitiker', 'cast', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'happen', 'tough', 'love', 'part', 'well', 'saying', ""n't"", 'care', 'clear', 'care', 'are', 'arguments', 'husband', 'wife', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'dishes', 'fly', 'frying', 'pan', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'son', 'go', 'along', 'relocation', 'little', 'girl', 'cries', 'lot', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'little', 'life', 'Tensions', 'do', 'more', 'mount', 'explode', 'were', 'times', 'own', 'emotions', 'were', 'touched', 'found', 'eyes', 'tearing', 'up.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'unique', 'angle', 'what', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'lives', 'one', 'particular', 'family', 'made', 'think']",N/A

This is not unlike the situation of a frog not noticingthe hot water he's got into over time, by the unnoticeably  slighttemperature increases.Here,  Tom Sizemore  plays  Bobby &#34;Bats&#34; ( a hot-head ) expendingeveryone to pray on his altar on a regular basis, with the natural,and warm M, Mastrantonio as his wife. His  intensity is unquestionable.In between the moments of tension - from needing to escape from aninternal &#34;putsch&#34; of his organization ( stemming from a confidanteof his, who stooled to the head-honcho ) and of changingback-and-forth from becoming an informant under the witnessprotection program, there's also the emotional roller-coaster offacing up to decades of bullying attitudes, limited family time,and events that he's either witnessed personally, commanded orparticipated in -  urged on by the FBI agents played by Shawn Hatosyand Forest Whitaker very convincingly pulling the confession andevidence in view of testimony.It opens the eyes to those eying the possibility of joining the WPPprogram, or those  curious in how it  plays out from a personalturmoil point of view.The impact on viewers is tremendous ...dramatic in the true senseof the word.
