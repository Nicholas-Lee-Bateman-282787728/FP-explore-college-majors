798824,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0001BFDKU,Acute Observer,"[3, 16]","The film begins with a view of Dealey Plaza in Dallas Texas. Some frames from the Zapruder film are shown. The accused assassin was bumped off in the police station. The American people still believe in a conspiracy theory. This film is an attempt to argue against this. It shows news film from that time. The short quotes from some people are designed to advance their argument. There is a realistic-looking reproduction of the Zapruder film with a voice telling us what to believe, giving an opinion as fact. They glide over a number of facts that they find inconvenient. You must read some books to become educated about this event. ""I'm just a patsy.""President Johnson believed this was a Communist conspiracy that would be followed by a Nuclear War. [The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred in October 1962.] This film said Lee Oswald had no friends but some book said he was elected eighth grade class president. After three years in the Marines he quit to travel to the USSR. Oswald was without education and skills, they said. What a comment on his experiences! The people who befriended him then now speak out against him. There was no handwritten confession about his plans although he did write about other things. Any good book will tell about Oswald's strange behavior. ""He was not a stupid guy."" Were any of Oswald's plans written down? Did Ruth Paine get Oswald his job at the Texas Schoolbook Depository Building? If so, did she have some kind of connection?Why did Oswald leave his marriage ring and his money behind on the morning of 11/22/1963? Did this ever happen before? No records were kept of Oswald's interrogation in the police station. Jack Ruby was well known to the police. [Was he the leader of organized crime and given orders to do it?] Why was Jack Ruby among the reporters? Was the transfer of Oswald delayed until Jack Ruby could get there? Was it one crazy killing another crazy? Most Americans suspected a conspiracy after Oswald's death, just like many Europeans. The illustration showing a bullet hitting JFK's shoulder then going into Connally's back has two problems. It doesn't account for the entrance wound in JFK's throat and ignores the lack of an exit wound in JFK's front shoulder. It seems to be faked. Connally always said he was hit by the second shot.In 1976 the House Select Committee reopened the investigation. The analysis of an audio tape led to the conclusion of four shots from two shooters. Robert Blakey said organized crime hired Oswald to shoot JFK, and Jack Ruby to silence Oswald. But another witness said organized crime never talked about it. There was no mention of the tree growing in front of the TSBD building which blocked the view of the limousine for a while. Jim Garrison found a link to Oswald in New Orleans, but it wasn't proved. [Read the books about this.] This film attacks Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" film and uses a two-dimensional drawing to line up JFK and Connally so a single bullet struck both men. [My impression from their demeanor was that some of the witnesses weren't truthful.]David Wrone's ""The Zapruder Film"" presents a photograph to prove that Oswald, not a co-worker, was in the doorway when the first shot was fired. That overturns the Warren Report and those who defend it. George O'Toole's 1974 book ""The Assassination Tapes"" provided objective proof for questioning the Warren Report.",1,Another Defense of the Lone Gunman Theory,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,3373,"['film', 'view', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'frames', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'accused', 'assassin', 'was', 'bumped', 'off', 'police', 'station', 'American', 'people', 'still', 'believe', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'film', 'attempt', 'argue', 'news', 'film', 'time', 'short', 'quotes', 'people', 'are', 'designed', 'advance', 'argument', 'realistic-looking', 'reproduction', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'voice', 'telling', 'what', 'believe', 'giving', 'opinion', 'fact', 'glide', 'number', 'facts', 'find', 'inconvenient', 'must', 'read', 'books', 'become', 'educated', 'event', ""'m"", 'just', 'patsy', 'President', 'Johnson', 'believed', 'was', 'Communist', 'conspiracy', 'would', 'be', 'followed', 'Nuclear', 'War', '[', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'occurred', 'October', '1962', ']', 'film', 'said', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'had', 'friends', 'book', 'said', 'was', 'elected', 'eighth', 'grade', 'class', 'president', 'three', 'years', 'Marines', 'quit', 'travel', 'USSR', 'Oswald', 'was', 'education', 'skills', 'said', 'What', 'comment', 'experiences', 'people', 'who', 'befriended', 'then', 'now', 'out', 'was', 'handwritten', 'confession', 'plans', 'did', 'write', 'other', 'things', 'good', 'book', 'will', 'tell', 'Oswald', 'strange', 'behavior', 'was', 'not', 'stupid', 'guy', 'Were', 'Oswald', 'plans', 'written', 'down', 'Did', 'Ruth', 'Paine', 'get', 'Oswald', 'job', 'Texas', 'Schoolbook', 'Depository', 'Building', 'so', 'did', 'have', 'kind', 'connection', 'Why', 'did', 'Oswald', 'leave', 'marriage', 'ring', 'money', 'morning', '11/22/1963', 'Did', 'ever', 'happen', 'records', 'were', 'kept', 'Oswald', 'interrogation', 'police', 'station', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'police', '[', 'Was', 'leader', 'organized', 'crime', 'given', 'orders', 'do', 'Why', 'was', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'reporters', 'Was', 'transfer', 'Oswald', 'delayed', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'could', 'get', 'there', 'Was', 'one', 'crazy', 'killing', 'crazy', 'Most', 'Americans', 'suspected', 'conspiracy', 'Oswald', 'death', 'just', 'many', 'Europeans', 'illustration', 'showing', 'bullet', 'hitting', 'JFK', 'shoulder', 'then', 'going', 'Connally', 'back', 'two', 'problems', ""n't"", 'account', 'entrance', 'wound', 'JFK', 'throat', 'lack', 'exit', 'wound', 'JFK', 'front', 'shoulder', 'be', 'faked', 'Connally', 'always', 'said', 'was', 'hit', 'second', 'shot.In', '1976', 'House', 'Select', 'Committee', 'reopened', 'investigation', 'analysis', 'audio', 'tape', 'led', 'conclusion', 'four', 'shots', 'two', 'shooters', 'Robert', 'Blakey', 'said', 'organized', 'crime', 'hired', 'Oswald', 'shoot', 'JFK', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'silence', 'Oswald', 'witness', 'said', 'organized', 'crime', 'never', 'talked', 'was', 'mention', 'tree', 'growing', 'front', 'TSBD', 'building', 'blocked', 'view', 'limousine', 'while', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'found', 'link', 'Oswald', 'New', 'Orleans', 'was', ""n't"", 'proved', '[', 'Read', 'books', ']', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'film', 'two-dimensional', 'drawing', 'line', 'up', 'JFK', 'Connally', 'so', 'single', 'bullet', 'struck', 'men', '[', 'impression', 'demeanor', 'was', 'witnesses', 'were', ""n't"", 'truthful', ']', 'David', 'Wrone', 'Zapruder', 'Film', 'photograph', 'prove', 'Oswald', 'not', 'co-worker', 'was', 'doorway', 'when', 'first', 'shot', 'was', 'fired', 'Warren', 'Report', 'who', 'defend', 'George', ""O'Toole"", '1974', 'book', 'Assassination', 'Tapes', 'provided', 'objective', 'proof', 'questioning', 'Warren', 'Report']",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy
798825,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B0001BFDKU,Amazon Customer,"[57, 80]","The negative reviews here are really eye-opening in the level hostility they exhibit.  I see a lot of sneering condemnation of this documentary as ""propaganda"", ""ridiculous"", ""dishonest"", ""junk"", and ""GARBAGE"" (in caps no less), what I DON'T see a lot of is these negative reviewers challenging this documentary's evidence with any facts.  I just see a lot of visceral, emotional reaction.  It's pretty clear that these reviewers had their balloon popped and not only did not like it, they will not face up to it either.  The title of every one of those reviews ought to be: ""I know what I know; don't bother me with facts!""  On reviewer even states that he stopped watching less than halfway through the program.  Well how CAN his rebutal be an intelligent let alone informed one?And those negative reviewers who do try to cite facts get them WRONG!  One, for example, starts the shots at Zapruder frame 210, giving only 5.6 seconds for the assassination.  They really began at frame 160, giving over 8 seconds.  Another talks about that the Warren Commission ""moving a wound up 5 to six inches"" in order to ""put this wound in the neck"", and also talks about moving Kennedy's head wound up ""not one, not two, but 4 full inches from the Eop at the base of the skull to the cowlick in the center of the head.""!?!I've seen the Kennedy autopsy photos.  You can see them for yourself at any number of websites that a google search will turn up in less than 3 seconds.  The clearly show a large wound at the top of JFK's skull, not at the base, and they also show a wound at the base of the president's neck, not the middle of his upper back where the CTs claim it is.  The same reviewer asks: ""...now ponder for a moment, do you think a neuromuscular reaction is stronger than a speeding bullet?""  As a matter of fact, yes.  Yes it is. The reviewer also seems to have forgotten a basic law of physics: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  If the impact of a bullet had enough force to hurl a human body about like a rag doll, the recoil of the gun firing that bullet would be equally savage, and would hurl the shooter backward with just as much force.  Shoot a rifle like the one Oswald fired, and you will experience no such level of recoil.  Shoot such a gun at an animal of roughly the same body mass as an average adult human male -- such as a good sized white tail deer buck, for example -- and you will very often see the animal jerk NOT AT ALL, and instead, just start running in reaction to the hit.  I know this from experience.  A tiny piece of lead, weighing no more than an ounce or two simply doesn't have the ability to shove over a hundred pounds around like nothing, not even when it's travelling at 2500 feet per second.  It just zips through, making a hole, and the violent jerk, if there is one, is the result of a neuromuscular spasm.  And this is particularly true if the head -- the bio-electric generator that sends electric impulses out to the muscles -- is the target that is zapped.This documentary serves up a good healthy dose or reality.  A lot of people need to face it.  I never cease to marvel at how people believe that the CIA, the Mob, LBJ, the Castro regime, and/or some combination of any or all of the above carried off a plot to kill Kennedy without letting the cat out of the bag, and then, still more incredibly, the LBJ White House, the Supreme Court, the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas Police Department, as well as doctors, nurses, reporters, and any number of others ALL conspired after the fact to bury all evidence of this before it could reach the public, and in over 40 years, NO ONE among these hordes of people in the know EVER betrayed any part of the plot.  Give me a break.  Face up to reality people.

No matter what your opinion of the assassination, Peter Jennings is a sham. Even if you believe that Oswald was the lone assassin this is truly an embarrassment to your cause.The premise: Peter Jennings attempts to prove that Oswald committed the assassination all by himself. He fails miserably at both. All Jennings proves is that most people whom support the Warren Report never read it, otherwise his facts would not be so wrong.1. Even the cover box is laughably wrong. The cover box states that Leon Zapruder took the only film of the assassination with a 16mm camera.FACTS: Abraham Zapruder filmed with a 8mm, as did others such as Maureen Muchmore and Orville Nix, just like it says in the Warren Report.2. The assassination took place in 9 seconds?FACTS: The assassination took place in 5.6 seconds as stated in the Warren Report. We know this because of the timing of the Zapruder film (18.3 frames per second) and the tree blocking the window. The window was unblocked from frames 210 to 313, meaning 5.6 seconds.3. The first shot missed?FACTS: Nowhere in the Warren Report does it say any such thing. The ""missed"" shot Jennings is referring to is the one that hit bystander James Tague. According to Jennings the first shot was fired about frame 160, when JFK's car and Tague were on different sides of the plaza. How could the world's greatest marksman-miss the car so totally as to hit a man almost 90o to his right?4. The Warren Commission's experts agreed that exhibit 399 matched Oswald's rifle and wounded JFK and Connally?FACTS: The Commission's experts were split on this issue. Two ballistics experts testified that ex399 matched the rifle but autopsy doctors James Humes and Perry Fink testified the copper bullet was in far too fair condition to cause seven wounds to two men.5. Oliver Stone called exhibit 399 ""pristine"" but it is not pristine?FACTS: The term ""pristine bullet"" comes straight from the Warren Report. That's the whole point Stone was trying to make, far too many fragments were found for a pristine bullet to have caused seven wounds to two men.6. Exhibit 399 was found on Connally's stretcher?FACTS: The doctor who found the bullet, JC Thomelson never testified to any such thing. In fact when pressed by Arlen Specter on the issue, he said he'd be committing perjury if he said he found it on Connally's stretcher.",1,Beyond The Facts,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2465,"['far', 'sloppiest', 'reporting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion', 'assassination', 'Peter', 'Jennings', 'sham', 'Even', 'believe', 'Oswald', 'was', 'lone', 'assassin', 'truly', 'embarrassment', 'cause.The', 'premise', 'Peter', 'Jennings', 'attempts', 'prove', 'Oswald', 'committed', 'assassination', 'miserably', 'Jennings', 'proves', 'most', 'people', 'whom', 'support', 'Warren', 'Report', 'never', 'read', 'otherwise', 'facts', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'wrong.1', 'Even', 'cover', 'box', 'laughably', 'wrong', 'cover', 'box', 'states', 'Leon', 'Zapruder', 'took', 'only', 'film', 'assassination', '16mm', 'camera.FACTS', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'filmed', '8mm', 'did', 'others', 'such', 'Maureen', 'Muchmore', 'Orville', 'Nix', 'just', 'Warren', 'Report.2', 'assassination', 'took', 'place', '9', 'seconds', 'FACTS', 'assassination', 'took', 'place', '5.6', 'seconds', 'stated', 'Warren', 'Report', 'know', 'timing', 'Zapruder', 'film', '18.3', 'frames', 'second', 'tree', 'blocking', 'window', 'window', 'was', 'unblocked', 'frames', '210', '313', 'meaning', '5.6', 'seconds.3', 'first', 'shot', 'missed', 'FACTS', 'Nowhere', 'Warren', 'Report', 'say', 'such', 'thing', 'missed', 'shot', 'Jennings', 'referring', 'one', 'hit', 'bystander', 'James', 'Tague', 'According', 'Jennings', 'first', 'shot', 'was', 'fired', 'frame', '160', 'when', 'JFK', 'car', 'Tague', 'were', 'different', 'sides', 'plaza', 'How', 'could', 'world', 'greatest', 'marksman-miss', 'car', 'so', 'totally', 'hit', 'man', 'almost', '90o', 'right', '4', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'experts', 'agreed', 'exhibit', '399', 'matched', 'Oswald', 'rifle', 'wounded', 'JFK', 'Connally', 'FACTS', 'Commission', 'experts', 'were', 'split', 'issue', 'Two', 'ballistics', 'experts', 'testified', 'ex399', 'matched', 'rifle', 'autopsy', 'doctors', 'James', 'Humes', 'Perry', 'Fink', 'testified', 'copper', 'bullet', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'fair', 'condition', 'cause', 'seven', 'wounds', 'two', 'men.5', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'called', 'exhibit', '399', 'pristine', 'not', 'pristine', 'FACTS', 'term', 'pristine', 'bullet', 'straight', 'Warren', 'Report', 'whole', 'point', 'Stone', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'fragments', 'were', 'found', 'pristine', 'bullet', 'have', 'caused', 'seven', 'wounds', 'two', 'men.6', 'Exhibit', '399', 'was', 'found', 'Connally', 'stretcher', 'FACTS', 'doctor', 'who', 'found', 'bullet', 'JC', 'Thomelson', 'never', 'testified', 'such', 'thing', 'fact', 'when', 'pressed', 'Arlen', 'Specter', 'issue', 'said', ""'d"", 'be', 'committing', 'perjury', 'said', 'found', 'Connally', 'stretcher']",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy

But it is hardly journalism.  In fact, while the producers have lined up a series of experts to support their opinions, they also cleverly avoid a number of unanswered questions.  These questions actually become more and more obvious as you view the piece.Most damning is the computer animation of the assassination by a computer artist who proves that there was only one shooter through his brilliant production.  In a most dramatic fashion, this hack-for-hire declares, ""It's not even a single bullet theory.  It's a single bullet fact.""  To prove his point, he details the events frame-by-frame in the Zapruder film.  Only it's not the Zapruder film you're watching.  You're watching his computer rendition captioned with Zapruder frame numbers.  In this day in age, to create a computer simiulation as ""proof"" of anything is laughable.  Nothing is more easily manipulated than a computer image.  If George Lucas can create Jar Jar Binks, are we really to believe a cartoon by some hack with a 70's hairdo and a Hitler mustache regarding the Kennedy Assassination?No.Others, like the boyishly naive Gerald Posner, are equally guilty of gliding over circumstances that counter their need to show the assassination as a simple fluke of history.As a documentary of the assasination, there's some good footage to see.

Kennedy.Most of the pro-conspiracy advocates will fail to find any redeeming qualities in a program like this one, a program that bases its conclusions on just the FACTS in the case, and not fanciful, would-be theories of hidden gunmen, faked photographs, and forged autopsy records, etc.""Peter Jennings Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination -- Beyond Conspiracy"" dives head-first into the documented ""facts"" that we have, and presents a stylish and polished and completely acceptable documentary based on those facts (none of which has ever been proven to be inaccurate to the point of dismissal, including, of course, the highly-controversial ""Single-Bullet Theory"").I like the way ABC presents the case in this program, pulling no punches along the way. It's obvious to them, as it is to me, that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone killer of JFK (and Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit as well) in 1963.And, seeing as how every scrap of physical evidence in both the Kennedy and Tippit murder cases does indeed point in the direction of Lee Oswald having acted alone, I cannot fathom how so many individuals still seem to want to cling to the idea of conspiracy. And, no, I certainly do not believe for a single second that ALL of this large wealth of evidence against Oswald could have possibly been faked, fabricated from whole cloth, or otherwise tampered with, so as to implicate an innocent ""patsy"" named Lee H. Oswald. That notion, to me, is far more fanciful than anything the Warren Commission published in 1964.With the aid of Mr. Dale K. Myers' very detailed 3-D models (which show that the ""SBT"" is far from a ""Lone Nut dream""), Peter Jennings and ABC-TV paint a convincing portrait of the way things really occurred on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.Mr. Myers' animations actually show that the Single-Bullet Theory is more than just a ""theory"" -- it's very likely the ONLY possible explanation to account for the wounding of JFK and Texas Governor John Connally. Because, without it, we would have another sort of ""Magic Bullet"" -- a bullet that enters Mr. Connally and completely disappears without a trace!In actuality, without the SBT, the number of vanishing ""Magic Bullets"" isn't just a mere one -- it's at least THREE (and that number goes up to an even more ridiculous FOUR according to many CTers, who are of the opinion that Governor Connally was struck by two separate missiles to account for his wounds).For, if the SBT is not the correct version of the wounding of Kennedy and Connally, then there simply MUST have been three (or four) different bullets which entered both men on November 22nd to cause the various wounds. And, to add to the incredibly-unbelievable nature of this silly pro-CT version of events, I guess we're supposed to swallow the oddball notion that TWO separate bullets (fired from two different guns) somehow BOTH failed to transit all the way through the body of President Kennedy, despite the known fact that not a single bone or hard surface was struck by either of these ""Magic CT Bullets"" during their time spent inside the back and neck of the President.Does that CT scenario sound like a logical multi-missile alternative to the Single-Bullet Theory? Hardly. To the contrary, I'm always amazed when a CTer can put such nonsense on the table and do it with a straight face. I know I couldn't. I'd be compelled to burst out laughing at such unsupportable conspiracy-slanted tripe.Plus, as mentioned, all of these bullets had to disappear into thin air in order to then be ""replaced"" by bullet #CE399 fired from Lee Oswald's rifle (which is the only bullet ever recovered from Parkland Hospital). It sure was a lucky day at Parkland for the ""Conspiracy Team"", huh?Quite obviously, that multiple-bullet conspiratorial version of the SBT never could have happened in a million lifetimes. But, amazingly, scads of conspiracy theorists actually believe that it did occur.There are many good-quality archival video clips utilized in this documentary, plus some new 2003 interviews featuring key players in the tragedy. But it's Dale Myers' 3-D mock-ups which really hit a bull's-eye here. 'Fascinating' is the best word for them, I would say.I would have liked more of the Myers' animation shown within this compelling 2-hour program (88 minutes sans commercials), but unfortunately much of Mr. Myers' comprehensive work was not used for this ABC special. But there's still enough shown for the viewer to obviously know that Mr. Myers hasn't just slapped this 3-D computer model together overnight.  He has been working on this animation project for many years. And that level of research and detail comes through in the all-too-brief demonstration of his work on this program.Additional facts and information regarding Dale Myers' 3-D computer models can be located at the following web address: [...]Books, movies, television documentaries, and videos on the subject of the JFK assassination have been decidedly one-sided, favoring one conspiracy angle or another. But there are far too few pieces of material about that fateful Friday in Texas which focus attention on the idea that there was NO conspiracy, and that a lone oddball named Lee Harvey Oswald took a rifle with him to work on the morning of November 22nd, 1963, and fired three shots from a sixth-floor warehouse window, killing the President of the United States.This well-done ABC program fills a very important gap with regard to video material relating to the assassination of President John F.

798832,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0001BFDKU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","[REVIEW FROMPeter Jennings Reporting - The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy] This 2007 documentary (original air date 2003) is a fine meat-n-potatoes pastiche of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the news after the fact and the conspiracy theories that have mounted to this very moment.While I saw this before, I just caught it again on the History Channel - I have to point out, this is not 'hosted' or 'presented' by Peter Jennings. Makes me a poor reviewer, but I also do not know who narrated it - but I know it wasn't Jennings.This film zips from everyone, from Lee Oswald's surviving brother to Jack Ruby's rabbi, in lightning-quick sketches of the conspiracies immediately answered by the facts. It's rather dry stuff, but I was not only thrilled to see all this footage for the first time in a film (i.e., Oswald's dead body being placed in the ambulance) - it was fun to see the true story behind Oliver Stone'sJFK.It was nothing if not a good solid slap in Stone's face.Frankly, I see this documentary as a good starting point for those new to the whole JFK assassination. There was a good documentary, first broadcast earlier this year, showing strong evidence that Oswald fired a fourth shot - his first, really, but it hit a traffic light - and there's that other documentary I can't place and can't even recall who hosted. Really, it's the missing documentaries that bug the hell out of me and make me think 'conspiracy'.This documentary film, however, will certainly satisfy you as to what is officially said to have happened, what the main conspiracy theories are (rather thinly addressed in my opinion, but here they all are), and as I said, good footage/interviews. This is a good 'starter' DVD for anyone interested in picking up this old hat; at least it'll be new to you. The one thing that might astonish you is the film seems to endorse the idea that Marcello, Mafia boss of New Orleans, may have been the one who ordered JFK killed.As an aside for your reference, I recall and recommend the excellent documentaries for the Discovery Channel, ""Unsolved History: JFK ~ Beyond the Magic Bullet"" (see my review IF you can find the darned thing here, it is available), ""Unsolved History: JFK ~ Conspiracy"" (and 2008's ""Unsolved History: JFK ~ Inside the Target Car"" which is for some reason unavailable on video). May I say, I highly recommend these exquisite forensic studies and especially the respect with which they treat the moment of JFK's assassination.",5,"JFK light, or, the government needs your trust on this ....",1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,2501,"['[', 'REVIEW', 'FROMPeter', 'Jennings', 'Reporting', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'Beyond', 'Conspiracy', '2007', 'documentary', 'original', 'air', 'date', '2003', 'fine', 'meat-n-potatoes', 'pastiche', 'assassination', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'news', 'fact', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'have', 'mounted', 'very', 'moment.While', 'saw', 'just', 'caught', 'again', 'History', 'Channel', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'not', ""'hosted"", ""'presented"", 'Peter', 'Jennings', 'Makes', 'poor', 'reviewer', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'narrated', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jennings.This', 'film', 'zips', 'everyone', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'surviving', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'rabbi', 'lightning-quick', 'sketches', 'conspiracies', 'immediately', 'answered', 'facts', 'rather', 'dry', 'stuff', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'thrilled', 'see', 'footage', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'i.e.', 'Oswald', 'dead', 'body', 'being', 'placed', 'ambulance', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'true', 'story', 'Oliver', ""Stone'sJFK.It"", 'was', 'nothing', 'not', 'good', 'solid', 'slap', 'Stone', 'face.Frankly', 'see', 'documentary', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'new', 'whole', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'was', 'good', 'documentary', 'first', 'broadcast', 'earlier', 'year', 'showing', 'strong', 'evidence', 'Oswald', 'fired', 'fourth', 'shot', 'first', 'really', 'hit', 'traffic', 'light', 'other', 'documentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'who', 'hosted', 'Really', 'missing', 'documentaries', 'bug', 'hell', 'make', 'think', 'documentary', 'film', 'however', 'will', 'certainly', 'satisfy', 'what', 'officially', 'said', 'have', 'happened', 'what', 'main', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'are', 'rather', 'thinly', 'addressed', 'opinion', 'here', 'are', 'said', 'good', 'footage/interviews', 'good', ""'starter"", 'DVD', 'anyone', 'interested', 'picking', 'up', 'old', 'hat', 'least', ""'ll"", 'be', 'new', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'astonish', 'film', 'endorse', 'idea', 'Marcello', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'New', 'Orleans', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'who', 'ordered', 'JFK', 'killed.As', 'aside', 'reference', 'recall', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'documentaries', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Unsolved', 'History', 'JFK', '~', 'Beyond', 'Magic', 'Bullet', 'see', 'review', 'can', 'find', 'darned', 'thing', 'here', 'available', 'Unsolved', 'History', 'JFK', '~', 'Conspiracy', '2008', 'Unsolved', 'History', 'JFK', '~', 'Target', 'Car', 'reason', 'unavailable', 'video', 'May', 'say', 'highly', 'recommend', 'exquisite', 'forensic', 'studies', 'especially', 'respect', 'treat', 'moment', 'JFK', 'assassination']",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy

798835,A3GUQ6WST3DR6Y,B0001BFDKU,Jennifer Cole,"[15, 33]","Give me an ever-lovin' break.No one in America has been or remains more eager to ""prove"" the poorly conducted prosecutor's brief that is The Warren Report than the American News Media.  Why? It could be they were bought off, rather implausible but they are beholden to the government for their licenses.  It could be they are embarrassed to retract their unwarranted approval of the report when it first arrived, it could be they embarrassed to retract the plethora of inaccurate and dishonest reporting they have provided the American people over the past 45 years on this subject.  Embarrassment at one's own foibles has made people do stupider things than that.  That's anybody's guess, but clearly the idea that the news media might have a vested interest in ""proving"" the Warren Report was right after all is not too difficult to imagine.  If someday someone finally unearths an undeniable smoking gun, think of the egg that will be on their faces. Of course they want you to believe they can prove it after all.  They can't or they surely wouldn't have waited 40 years to do so.To take the JFK murder ""beyond conspiracy"", one has to solve the crime, doesn't one?  And that is inarguably not accomplished in this program, only one of several pro-Warren Report ""documentaries"" that miraculously appeared on the scene at the 40th anniversary of the assassination.  Putting people in a computer simulated mock up and moving them about fractions of inches proves very little.  It might prove that it is theoretically possible for a bullet to have passed through both Kennedy and Connally, no one ever said it wasn't possible, nor would the bullet have had to come from the Book Depository in particular to have done so.  It does not explain how a bullet alleged to have done so and caused seven injuries in two men emerges in pristine condition, free of blood or tissue, or even a dent, on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital that was used by neither man, nor does it explain how they are obviously struck by different bullets according to the Zapruder film, the testimony of both Governor and Mrs. Connally, and the majority of the witnesses who testified regarding this impact.  Ask yourself why.All of the character assassination that can be dredged up in the entire world about Lee Harvey Oswald will not change the fact that not one single person saw, or claims to have seen, Mr. Oswald in that window pulling off a feat of marksmanship that could not be duplicated by the world's greatest sharpshooters with that piece of crap rifle.  Ask yourself why.And neither Peter Jennings nor the entire staff of ABC News combined can explain how the alleged crazed act of a lone nut in any way jeopardizes national security in such a manner as to cause the records and evidence in the case to be sealed from the public for 75 years.  Even in the 21st century, years after the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act and the Assassination Records Review Board, literally hundreds of thousands of documents (perhaps most notably Oswald's IRS records) remain hidden from the public.  Some have been demanded released in a court of law, YOUR courts of law, people, only to have the agencies responsible for these documents then claim they must have been ""accidentally"" destroyed. Ask yourself why.This ""documentary"" will be of great entertainment, and comfort and solace to those who, for their own personal reasons, cannot violate the official party line.  To those who truly wish to approach the assassination with an open mind, whether they are inclined to believe it was Oswald or someone else but want to know more, hard proof or even generally accepted facts are few and far between in this piece.

798837,A2NELRC2Y65O6F,B0001BFDKU,Kevin Beuret,"[3, 9]","John Adams was right--facts are inconvenient things, no more so than when they show once and for all that President Kennedy was murdered by a homicidal punk shooting from a window in the Texas School Book Depository--not, as revisionist liar Oliver Stone would have it, by several gunmen in several places.  At long last, a computer representation of the events that transpired in Dealey Plaza, based on a frame-by-frame analysis of the famous Zapruder film, plausibly suggests what happened and when on that terrible day.  There will always be perfectly honest students of the Kennedy assassination who believe the President's murder was the result of a conspiracy, but this absorbing documentary may give them something to think about.In any case, many of the conspiracy theories have fatal flaws, or at least unanswerable objections.  For example:  If there was a gunman on the grassy knoll, how could he have escaped detection and capture?  And if there was a gunman who popped up from a convenient sewer and shot at President Kennedy, how did the bullet keep from striking the grille or the windshield of the presidential limousine?  Common sense alone refutes the absured inventions of revisionist loonies like Oliver Stone, and their very source--Mr. Stone's fevered imagination and his talent for disseminating gigantic lies--should dispel whatever credibility these explanations may have had in the first place.Finally:  If there truly was a conspiracy, why didn't Robert Kennedy try to root it out?  As Attorney General he commanded the formidable investigative resources of the F.B.I., and he would surely have done everything in his considerable power to bring his brother's murderer to justice.  That this fiercely willful and partisan man never investigated the supposed conspiracy behind his brother's death suggests that either there was no conspiracy in the first place or--incredibly--that RFK himself was a part of it.If you lived through those terrible days in 1963--or even if you didn't--I think you will find satisfaction and a kind of sad comfort in watching this elegant argument for what was almost certainly the simple but tragic truth behind the murder of John F.

This conclusion is not shared by a majority of americans, but then the majority of americans have not read extensively on the JFK assassination and have been fed conspiracy theories for 40 years!Peter Jennings and ABC news have produced a fair and objective DVD stating the facts of the assassination and arriving at a logical conclusion.  Their main piece of evidence is a computer simulation that places the exact positions of Kennedy and Connelly at the time the shots rang out.  The positions are based on a meticulous study of the Abraham Zapruder film that depicts the entire assassination as it occurred.  The computer simulation proves the most controverial aspect of the assassination, that being the so-called ""Magic Bullet Theory"", where one bullet must account for Kennedy's throat wound and all of Connelly's numerous wounds.  Long considered impossible by critics, the magic bullet theory is proven here in the computer simulation.  Why the critics of the magic bullet theory got it wrong is because of faulty and inaccurate positioning of the two men in the limosine.There is other conclusive evidence presented as well.  For instance, the angle of Kennedy and Connelly's wounds indicate being shot from behind and from an elevated position.  The simulation shows the killing shots could only have come from the upper floors of the southeast corner of the Schoolbook Depository.  Oswald's rifle was found on the 6th floor with his prints on it.  He worked at the depository and was last seen by co-workers on the 6th floor.  The autopsy on President Kennedy shows the wounds could only have come from behind and from an elevated position as well.Conspiracy critics will not ""like"" this DVD because it supports the Warren Commission's findings, which critics have lambasted since 1965.  The major fault with conspiracy theorists is that they never fully deal with the extensive physical evidence that exists for the case.  They sweep it aside too quickly as it confounds their numerous pet conspiracy theories.  Unfortunately for them, the evidence has to be considered and cannot be swept aside so easily.  This is the strength of this DVD - that the evidence is carefully examined and considered.  From the evidence, only one logical conclusion can be drawn - that Lee Oswald killed Kennedy.On the issue of whether Oswald was influenced by others in the assassination, we will never know the answer, for he took this information to the grave with him when he was shot by Jack Ruby, just a short 48 hours after Oswald killed JFK.  For me, this is the only unsolved mystery remaining in the assassination.I believe that this is a very objective and logical presentation of the evidence of the very controversial JFK assassination.  I highly recommend it for its logical approach and conclusion.JIm ""Konedog"" Koenig",5,A Kennedy Assassination Student Reviews this DVD,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,3029,"['Having', 'studied', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', '15', 'years', 'have', 'come', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'killed', 'Kennedy', 'shooting', 'three', 'shots', 'Texas', 'Schoobook', 'Depository', 'conclusion', 'not', 'shared', 'majority', 'americans', 'then', 'majority', 'americans', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'extensively', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'have', 'been', 'fed', 'conspiracy', 'theories', '40', 'years', 'Peter', 'Jennings', 'ABC', 'news', 'have', 'produced', 'fair', 'objective', 'DVD', 'stating', 'facts', 'assassination', 'arriving', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'main', 'piece', 'evidence', 'computer', 'simulation', 'exact', 'positions', 'Kennedy', 'Connelly', 'time', 'shots', 'rang', 'out', 'positions', 'are', 'based', 'meticulous', 'study', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'entire', 'assassination', 'occurred', 'computer', 'simulation', 'most', 'controverial', 'aspect', 'assassination', 'being', 'so-called', 'Magic', 'Bullet', 'Theory', 'where', 'one', 'bullet', 'must', 'account', 'Kennedy', 'throat', 'wound', 'Connelly', 'numerous', 'wounds', 'Long', 'considered', 'impossible', 'critics', 'magic', 'bullet', 'theory', 'proven', 'here', 'computer', 'simulation', 'Why', 'critics', 'magic', 'bullet', 'theory', 'got', 'wrong', 'faulty', 'inaccurate', 'positioning', 'two', 'men', 'limosine.There', 'other', 'conclusive', 'evidence', 'presented', 'as', 'well', 'instance', 'angle', 'Kennedy', 'Connelly', 'wounds', 'indicate', 'being', 'shot', 'behind', 'elevated', 'position', 'simulation', 'killing', 'shots', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'upper', 'floors', 'southeast', 'corner', 'Schoolbook', 'Depository', 'Oswald', 'rifle', 'was', 'found', '6th', 'floor', 'prints', 'worked', 'depository', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'co-workers', '6th', 'floor', 'autopsy', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'wounds', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'elevated', 'position', 'well.Conspiracy', 'critics', 'will', 'not', 'DVD', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'findings', 'critics', 'have', 'lambasted', '1965', 'major', 'fault', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'never', 'fully', 'deal', 'extensive', 'physical', 'evidence', 'case', 'sweep', 'aside', 'too', 'quickly', 'numerous', 'pet', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Unfortunately', 'evidence', 'be', 'considered', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'swept', 'aside', 'so', 'easily', 'strength', 'DVD', 'evidence', 'carefully', 'examined', 'considered', 'evidence', 'only', 'one', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'killed', 'Kennedy.On', 'issue', 'Oswald', 'was', 'influenced', 'others', 'assassination', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'answer', 'took', 'information', 'grave', 'when', 'was', 'shot', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'just', 'short', '48', 'hours', 'Oswald', 'killed', 'JFK', 'only', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'remaining', 'assassination.I', 'believe', 'very', 'objective', 'logical', 'presentation', 'evidence', 'very', 'controversial', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'highly', 'recommend', 'logical', 'approach', 'conclusion.JIm', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy

A cynic might conclude that some of the things Stone took ""dramatic license"" with (i.e. the magic bullet, ""back & to the left"", Oswald was a bad shot, etc...) were so obviously erroneous that it is clear his motive for making the film was to ""get paid"", which he did.Strongest (seemingly air-tight) case for a lone gunman / no conspiracy I've ever seen - bravo.

798842,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B0001BFDKU,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[24, 32]","I watched and taped this program when it was first broadcast in 2004 and was so impressed by it, I've kept the tape.  I am glad it is still available on DVD because ""Beyond Conspiracy"" is a well-done and convincing documentary on the Kennedy assassination that defends the Warren Commission's findings that Lee Harvey Oswald was the only shooter and acted alone.  Ironically, the simplest answer is hard to believe sometimes and many who support one conspiracy theory or another will probably not be swayed by this DVD, but the evidence shown in this report is strong and would need to be dealt with to defend any theories involving magic bullets, second gunman, Oswald's connections with the CIA or KGB, Jack Ruby's ties with the Mafia, etc.The most eye-opening part of this program are the findings of computer animator Dale Myers.  He designed a computerized 3D replica of Dealey Plaza which utilized the movements of JFK and Governor Connally in the Zapruder film to recreate the shooting.  The computer imagery shows the precise positions in the limousine and how a single bullet passed straight through both men causing their simultaneous reactions.  The bullet is then traced to its exact source--the sixth floor window of the Texas school book depository.  I was very impressed by this footage and think anyone interested in the assassination should see it.The program also gives a biography of Lee Harvey Oswald with interview clips of his older brother, Robert, a journalist who knew Oswald when he defected to the Soviet Union, and a woman who knew Oswald and his wife in Dallas.  It covers Oswald's troubled childhood, his attraction to Marxist philosophy, in large part, (according to his brother) to stand out from the crowd.  He had a flair for the dramatics (slitting his wrist in Russia so the Soviet authorities would allow him to stay in the country) and an obsessive need to be something more than he was.  When the motorcade route for JFK's visit was published in the paper and was revealed to pass right by the book depository where Oswald was a clerk, he seized the opportunity.  Even more important as evidence of Oswald's sole guilt is information on his plot to assassinate retired general and anti-Communist Edwin Walker.  Also, there is compelling evidence in this program revealing that Oswald was a superb marksman who was more than capable of shooting off the shots in the time allotted.The program does not ignore the conspiracy theories.  It covers the Warren Commission's failure to address the issue of Cuba and Castro's possible involvement (this area is probably not covered enough to refute conspiracy theorists).  The Mafia ties are examined as well and Jack Ruby is painted as a braggart and loose cannon who would make a poor candidate for a co-conspirator.  The fourth shot on the grassy knoll that scientists, in a 1976 re-examination of the Warren Report, claim can be heard from an open-microphone recording on a police motorcycle is refuted by Myers' computerized time-line of the motorcade that reveals officer McLain (who had always said he was not in position to pick up such a shot) was not in position the scientists claimed (Vince Bugliosi further dispels the fourth shot theory in his book ""Reclaiming History"").Finally, the program pokes many holes in Oliver Stone's motion picture ""JFK.""  It is very unfortunate that many people get their history from Hollywood. THIS DVD is one that needs to be watched on the Kennedy assassination, not a movie with actors and a script that takes artistic license.  One area that is not covered is the simulated trial of Lee Harvey Oswald in London, but, again, Bugliosi (the prosecutor in that trial) will cover this topic in his book.  Again, this program won't turn around everyone's opinion, but any discussion on the subject that does not at least address the compelling evidence revealed in ""Beyond Conspiracy"" is insufficient.",5,"""It's not even a single bullet theory, in my opinion, it's a single bullet fact""--Dale Myers",1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,3923,"['watched', 'taped', 'program', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', '2004', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'tape', 'am', 'glad', 'still', 'available', 'DVD', 'Beyond', 'Conspiracy', 'well-done', 'convincing', 'documentary', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'findings', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'was', 'only', 'shooter', 'acted', 'alone', 'Ironically', 'simplest', 'answer', 'hard', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'many', 'who', 'support', 'one', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'swayed', 'DVD', 'evidence', 'shown', 'report', 'strong', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'dealt', 'defend', 'theories', 'involving', 'magic', 'bullets', 'second', 'gunman', 'Oswald', 'connections', 'CIA', 'KGB', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'ties', 'Mafia', 'most', 'eye-opening', 'part', 'program', 'are', 'findings', 'computer', 'animator', 'Dale', 'Myers', 'designed', 'computerized', '3D', 'replica', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'utilized', 'movements', 'JFK', 'Governor', 'Connally', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'recreate', 'shooting', 'computer', 'imagery', 'precise', 'positions', 'limousine', 'how', 'single', 'bullet', 'passed', 'straight', 'men', 'causing', 'simultaneous', 'reactions', 'bullet', 'then', 'traced', 'exact', 'source', 'sixth', 'floor', 'window', 'Texas', 'school', 'book', 'depository', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'footage', 'think', 'anyone', 'interested', 'assassination', 'should', 'see', 'it.The', 'program', 'also', 'biography', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'interview', 'clips', 'older', 'brother', 'Robert', 'journalist', 'who', 'knew', 'Oswald', 'when', 'defected', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'Oswald', 'wife', 'Dallas', 'Oswald', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'attraction', 'Marxist', 'philosophy', 'large', 'part', 'according', 'brother', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'had', 'flair', 'dramatics', 'slitting', 'wrist', 'Russia', 'Soviet', 'authorities', 'would', 'allow', 'stay', 'country', 'obsessive', 'need', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'was', 'When', 'motorcade', 'route', 'JFK', 'visit', 'was', 'published', 'paper', 'was', 'revealed', 'pass', 'right', 'book', 'depository', 'where', 'Oswald', 'was', 'clerk', 'seized', 'opportunity', 'Even', 'more', 'important', 'evidence', 'Oswald', 'sole', 'guilt', 'information', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'retired', 'general', 'anti-Communist', 'Edwin', 'Walker', 'Also', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'program', 'revealing', 'Oswald', 'was', 'superb', 'marksman', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'shooting', 'off', 'shots', 'time', 'allotted.The', 'program', 'not', 'ignore', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'failure', 'address', 'issue', 'Cuba', 'Castro', 'possible', 'involvement', 'area', 'probably', 'not', 'covered', 'enough', 'refute', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'Mafia', 'ties', 'are', 'examined', 'well', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'painted', 'braggart', 'loose', 'cannon', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'poor', 'candidate', 'co-conspirator', 'fourth', 'shot', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'scientists', '1976', 're-examination', 'Warren', 'Report', 'claim', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'open-microphone', 'recording', 'police', 'motorcycle', 'refuted', 'Myers', 'computerized', 'time-line', 'motorcade', 'officer', 'McLain', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'position', 'pick', 'up', 'such', 'shot', 'was', 'not', 'position', 'scientists', 'claimed', 'Vince', 'Bugliosi', 'further', 'fourth', 'shot', 'theory', 'book', 'Reclaiming', 'History', '.Finally', 'program', 'many', 'holes', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'motion', 'picture', 'JFK', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'many', 'people', 'get', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'one', 'be', 'watched', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'not', 'movie', 'actors', 'script', 'artistic', 'license', 'One', 'area', 'not', 'covered', 'simulated', 'trial', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'London', 'again', 'Bugliosi', 'prosecutor', 'trial', 'will', 'cover', 'topic', 'book', 'Again', 'program', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'around', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'discussion', 'subject', 'not', 'least', 'address', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'revealed', 'Beyond', 'Conspiracy', 'insufficient']",ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy

Unfortunately,President Kennedy was wearing a brace for his bad back and this is why he didn't go forward when shot. It's a pity that some of those vociforous and abusive conspiracy theorist don't get all the facts.This documentary has interviews with Lee Harvey Oswald's brother and he states that he believes Oswald did it. There are interviews with Russian people that knew Oswald and people that knew Jack Ruby. Oswald's scoring records from his army days are produced that show he was a very good shot over 200 yards with scores of 48 and 49 out of 50. The distance between Oswald and Kennedy was only 60 yards. There is computer evidence presented that shows how the assassination by Oswald was achieved as well as a statement by director Oliver Stone about why he falsified facts in his movie JFK(&quot;dramatic licence&quot; he says). Unfortunately there are people that think his fictional account is the truth. This documentary reveals the defects in the JFK film,like the fact that Jim Garrison didn't even give the final summation in the court case(his subbordinates did). The line &quot;let the truth be known or the heavens fall&quot; is straightout fantasy from a Hollywood writer.

And most all the media continuously ran pictures of Trayvon Martin at age 12 and George Zimmerman photo-shopped to look ""white"".

Look at this very accurate digital reproduction of the Zapruder film and you'll see things that the conspiracy theorists NEVER show you-the TRUE relative positions of Kennedy and Connally and the tracking back of the shot to the 6th floor of the Depository.But could there have been a conspiracy involving Oswald?  Certainly not on the level that people of Oliver Stone's ilk would have you believe, and just look at the odds of even a small conspiracy: Oswald was only working in the Depository for about 5 weeks before the assassination. He only got the job through the efforts of Ruth Paine, the woman with whom Oswald's wife Marina lived.  The motorcade route was only announced a couple of weeks before, and was planned by the Secret Service, fanatically loyal to Kennedy.  What are the absolutely incredible odds that a man involved in a conspiracy to kill the president would benefit from such a monumental bit of coincidental luck? Pretty much zero.Aside from that, have a look at the quality of people who dismiss the conspiracy and those that support it. Oswald's own brother has absolutely no doubt. Only a real fanatic could think Gerald Ford dishonest or delusional, and he too is absolutely convinced. And many others the same, like Peter Jennings in this DVD. On the other side you have marginal people, people with chips on their shoulders or who see money to be made.

798849,A2NFM03IYQ47P8,B0001BFDKU,Todd W. Hemphill,"[9, 9]","Don't you just love the divide in the reviews. It's all or nothing. Frankly I too was a conspiracy buff for years but the more I learned the more I came to believe that the Warren Commision, and this FINE documentary, had it essentially right. (The order of the shots not withstanding) Here's just a few of the things that will jump out at you once you stop drinking the conspiracy Kool Aid;- When you put Kennedy and Connelly in their proper positions in the car there is no question about the single bullet ""theory"". Given the position of the wound on Connelly's back and it's forward and downward path you realize that the bullet HAD to go through Kennedy, there simply is no other way for it to get to that spot on Connelly's back. In additon it is an oblong wound which means the bullet was tumbling and bullets don't tumble until they hit something. So it's either a single bullet or Kennedy shot Connelly with a magic gun that makes a rifle bullet tumble! (Oops, I may have just started a new conspiracy theory!) Let me repeat that and feel free to check me on it... The wound on Connelly's back was an OBLONG wound. The bullet was tumbling. How can you explain that without coming to the conclusion that the bullet hit Kennedy first? Hmmm?- When Oswald was arrested he was carrying the revolver that several witnesses saw him shoot Officer J. D. Tippit with. It was matched ballistically to the bullets Tippit was shot with. Officer Tippit stopped Oswald for questioning because he matched the discription of the Dealy Plaza shooter which was given to the police by Howard Brennan as he sat on a wall facing the Book Depostitory. Brennan saw Oswald shoot Kennedy and discribed it in vivid detail. He saw Oswald well enough to give the police a discription that enabled Officer Tippit to stop a man who fit that discription. And, by golly, that man turned out to be the one employee who had left the Book Depository, Oswald. Upon being stopped Oswald gunned Tippit down! This is the same Oswald who left his wedding ring and all his money next to his sleeping wife and who told his car pooling pal that he was bringing ""curtain rods"" to work. No curtain rods were found in the Book Depository but a rifle that Oswald had been photographed with was found with his prints on it and three spent cartridges. (The authenticity of the photo has been verified 29 times and the vast majority of the witnesses, 88%, said they heard three shots. 7% said they heard fewer and only 5% said they heard more.) After the shooting, when a cop stops him, Oswald guns him down! Gee, what does it all mean? Honestly, of all the OBVIOUS things that get lost in the conspiracy haze none is as blatant as Oswald's actions following the shooting. They are clearly the acts of a guilty man. And the fact that a witness gave the police an accurate enough discription of the shooter that Tippit was able to spot Oswald based on it is even omitted in this documentary. Sometimes the most obvious things just get passed over. Ask a conspiracy buff who Howard Brennan was and wait for the blank stare. Once you tell them they'll just have to add him to their never ending list of co-conspiritors.- The autopsy evidence CLEARLY shows that the wounds to Kennedy's head were a small entry wound in the rear and a large exit wound to the front/right of his head. (Which would account for the recoil back and to the left as this documentary points out.) And please spare me the Best Evidence/Lifton non-sense. This is a guy who came to the conclusion that NONE of the shots came from behind. Try making sense of the bullet that hit Connelly with that guy's theories! (It was actually after reading the Lifton book and that conclusion that I seriously began to question the conspiracy theories. If someone could write a best seller and make THAT obvious of a mistake something had to be rotten.)Now, saddly, if you're one of the people who gave this fine documentary one star because you're too invested in years of being a conspiracy buff to give it up, all of this will bounce off of you like BBs on a battleship.

Oliver Stone and other conspiracists must lie about that in order to make their case, but in this documentary we see the truth-- the supposed impossible pathway becomes absolutely possible when you match Kennedy's and Governor Connely's positions in the car, and the fact that Connelly's seat was 3 inches lower than Kennedy's.

798852,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B0001BFDKU,Yasha Banana,"[12, 29]","This so-called ""documentary"" is beneath contempt.The narrator, Peter Jennings, does something quite revealing at the beginning of the program.  He points out that there are so many conspiracies regarding the Kennedy assassination that ""we don't have time to delve into all of them."" ... And so what does the program do?  It delves into *none* of them.In other words, here's a purported documentary that seeks to debunk the idea that JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy and then convenienlty sets aside  consideration of *any* of the conspiracy theories being offered.Moreover, along with this set-aside of conspiracy theories there is a set-aside of the truckloads of FACTS that back up these various conspiracy theories!-- No mention is made of the fact that the majority of people present at the assassination site, including the police, pointed to and rushed the grassy knoll.-- No mention is made of the witnesses who swore that they saw Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby together before the assassination.-- No mention is made of the fact that assassination attempts, via a conspiracy,  were foiled in Chicago and Miami before Kennedy went to Dallas.-- No mention is made of the unlikely number of ""accidental deaths"" of key witnesses in the case.-- No mention is made of Kennedy's promise after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to ""shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces.""And on and on.Instead of pointing out these facts and attempting to rebut them, the program simply ignores them.In place of an intellectually honest confrontation with these facts, the program -- rather I should say the ""show"" -- spends an inordinate amount of time on:a.) Oswald's ""personality"" -- in other words his a priori predisposition to being (guess what?) a lone nut.  (Lone nut, lone gunman -- get it?)b.) Oliver Stone's obviously flawed and at times ridiculous movie ""JFK."" andc.) Jim Garrison's inconsequential trial of Clay Shaw.Interestingly enough, the show does something that is *common* to all claims that Oswald and Oswald alone killed Kennedy.  It maintains that the reason why people are inclined to believe in a conspiracy is that they simply can't accept that a great man such as John Kennedy was shot by a loser, a nut, ""a nobody.""  That the balance between a great man, on the one hand, versus a lone assassin on the other just doesn't sit well with the American public.But this is nonsense.  The majority of Americans don't believe the Warren Commission, especially today, because they know incontrovertible *facts* about the American government and American mainstream and how they operate. ...They know that not just the government but mainstream media *lie* about what the government does.  It knows full well about the lies regarding Vietnam, the lies regarding Watergate, the lies regarding the Iraq War, and now the lies regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  (You might recall that initially, incredibly, BP said *no* oil spilled; the government dutifully backing them up.)The American public knows full well about the myriad lies put forth by the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and the State Department.  *That's* why they distrust the Warren Commission, a joke of an investigation.  That's why, try as this show might, it falls flat on its face trying to convince anyone with even a *shred* of knowledge that Oswald acted alone.And the general population's knowledge of how the government and how mainstream media lie is not based on ""theories,"" it's based on  facts.... Did Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon lie about Vietnam?... Was Vietnam a threat to the United States?... Was Nixon lying about Watergate?... Did the CIA overthrow governments in Guatemala, Iran, Chile?... Did Nixon, McCarthy, HUAC, et al lie about ""The Red Menace""?... Were there WMDs in Iraq?... When the vote to go to war with Iraq came up in the Senate, did Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld *and* the mainstream of the Democratic Party lie about the threat posed by Iraq to the security of the United States?... Think maybe the same lies are being perpetrated as regards Iran?  But don't worry *that* question will never be explored by ABCNBCCBSCNNTIMENEWSWEEKTHENEWYORKTIMES.This longstanding *history* of lying is not based on conspiracy theories or mere conjecture; in fact, quite the contrary -- it's there in plain sight.It's always quite remarkable, breathtaking really, when one sees mainstream media in the United States gearing up to propagandize the American public.  That Peter Jennings was able to host this show with a straight face is a tribute to his fealty to the power elite in general and his ruling elite neighbors/colleagues in particular --the ruling elite only getting upset at each other when really important issues are being debated, such as which yacht wax they prefer.For a documentary that's not only intellectually honest but that also puts the Kennedy assassination in the *context* of what was going on at the time -- re. the  the FBI, the CIA, the Cuban crazies, the right-wing crazies and the Mafia -- see ""The Murder of JFK: A Revisionist History"" - http://www.amazon.com/Murder-JFK-Revisionist-History/dp/B000BT96PK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1255789741&sr;=8-2By contrast, Peter Jennings' apparatchik piece of garbage treats the JFK assassination like a fairy tale -- wherein the good prince is suddenly and brazenly taken from us by the evil lone gunman.  As if virtually nothing was going on politically besides that oft-told media-inspired fairy tale -- a fairy tale ""FPC"" (""For Public Consumption"") -- long since dismissed by serious investigators into the JFK assassination.As for Peter Jennings' integrity, why pick on the man? -- his lack of integirty is no different than that of his compatriots: Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Katie Couric, Brian Williams. ... When Peter Jennings was alive, what do you think would have happened if he had gone to his bosses at ABC and sayid ""How's 'bout we do an investigative report on Disney.  (Disney being the parent company of ABC.)  Yeah, we'll investigate how they treat their American workers, and the fact that they run sweatshops in third world countries."" ... ABC being owned by Disney, he would have been fired in a New York minute.Not that the thought would even cross Jennings' mind -- self-censorship being the most effective kind of thought control.And what do you imagine would happen if Tom Brokaw of NBC got the bright, albeit democratically-appropriate notion of doing a report on General Electric.  Its sweetheart contracts with the Pentagon; the fact that General Electric consistently underpays what it should in corporate taxes, and that for three years running didn't pay *any* corporate taxes. ... Well, seeing that General Elelectic owns NBC no doubt the thought never closed Honest-Upright, Bought-and-Paid-For good ole Tom's mind.Think anyone over at CNN will say anything essentially or fundamentally negative about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, wars that are making Corporate America rich -- CNN owned and sponsored by the leading ranks of Corporate America.No, Peter Jennings, like all bought-and-paid-for corporate mouthpieces, did his job and was amply rewarded.  Like the political establishment, meaning the Democratic-Republican duopoly, he was nothing more than a servant of the economic elite.That he did this via the cockeyed premises this ""show"" purports, and in so blatantly and outrageous a manner, brings to mind what Hitler said in ""Mein Kampf"" about The Big Lie; namely, if the lie is big enough and outrageous enough and is told often enough, that, so those in power hope, the lie will take root.Though I doubt in the case of this piece of crap-nonsense Jennings and ABC got away with it -- albeit ABC et al are still at it, still trying to pour cement over the lies.No one in mainstream media would dare violate the self-censorship rules that effectively prohibits any challenge to the righteousness (and inevitablility) of the political establishment or the predatory motives of American foreign policy.For more on Peter-The-Spinless Jennings, see ""The death of Peter Jennings and the state of the American media"" -- [...]Quoting from that article by David Walsh:""During their maudlin tribute to Jennings on ""World News Tonight,"" his colleagues at ABC referred to him as a ""consummate reporter."" He was no such thing. A penetrating journalist would have had no difficulty in uncovering and exposing the Bush administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction, the supposed ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda and all the rest. If he had done that, he would have left a legacy of real value.""But if Jennings had seriously questioned the behavior of government officials over Iraq ""on behalf of the public,"" he would not have kept his $10 million-a-year salary, nor received grateful tributes from George W. Bush, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Democrats John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi after his death. ...""One cannot point to a single broadcast of his that expressed a deep concern for (the) lives and difficulties (of average people) -- along the lines of Edward R. Murrow's Harvest of Shame in 1960 -- or revealed some harsh truth about America that led to genuine soul-searching.Instead, for the most part, he adapted himself to the tabloidizing of American television news, hosting programs, for example, about ""The Search for Jesus"" and UFOs. ...""Public opinion in the US is formed by a painstaking process, a daily cycle through which the media fixes its ""take"" on events and transmits that to its viewing audience. On the morning television programs (NBC's ""Today"" and ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in particular) the basic stories are laid out.""Often a major government figure will be interviewed. The American people are told what their concerns and opinions are. On the three network evening programs, one is given the official version of what happened during the day, the events are packaged and tied up neatly. The anchor person sums up the day and puts it all in perspective.""If a significant event takes place late enough in the day so that the official line has not entirely been worked out by 6:30 or 7 p.m., there is always ABC's ""Nightline"" at 11:30 p.m. or the comic monologues on the late-night talk shows. By the next morning, the cycle begins again. In this manner the American ruling elite strives to create a national consensus.""The process has been more or less perfected. The problem, however, is that the entire media machine has been systematically discredited by its deplorable role on every major political question of the last two decades.""The evening news programs and their avuncular anchormen, in particular, fulfill a quite significant function. These individuals are not simply talking heads, mere empty vessels. Their job is to hold the country together, particularly at those moments when events threaten to get out of hand in a country so heterogeneous and so internally divided along social, ethnic and demographic lines. The demeanor and voice of a Jennings are meant to reassure the public that everything is under control, continuity has been preserved, the old institutions are operating smoothly. ...""(Now minus not only Peter Jennings but also Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather) America is headed into uncharted waters, without a number of the reassuring faces and voices that in the past conferred the imprimatur of legitimacy on so many lies and crimes.""",1,"""God bless the truth that fights toward the sun, they pour the lies over it and think that it is done.""
