1068983,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B000P6YNSE,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[3, 5]","Lost - The Complete Third Season started off so-so but finished with a bang! I think Matthew Fox should've received an Emmy nomination for his riveting and heartbreaking performance in the season finale, how good is he?! Although we the fans have to wait 'til next February to see what happened, I can't wait because I think the fourth season will probably be the best, more twist and turns just ahead for the passengers of Oceanic Flight 815. Of course there were some casualties this season, we lost some great cast members, and what's with Juliet's face? The muscles in her face don't move? Can you say botox junkie!  My fave character is John Locke played by the extraordinary Terry O'Quinn, in flashbacks the long-kept secret of how Locke got into that wheelchair was finally revealed, it was a brilliant episode. I highly recommend buying season 3.

1068992,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B000P6YNSE,B. Martin,"[2, 2]","The tag line for this review references the title of the finale of Season 3, a jaw dropping, mind bending, shocker that pointed the series in a new direction and laid the groundwork for the endgame that would begin to unfold in Season 4.  Yes, it is an extremely pivotal episode for this groundbreaking show, yet it seems that it is the only thing that people remember from what was an otherwise excellent third season.  Critics and fans alike grew extremely frustrated with this installment of the series, only to jump back on board the Lost bandwagon at the season's end.  That's unfortunate since Season 3 is the most underrated of the show's run and quite possibly the best.The season opens where season 2 left off.  Jack, Kate and Sawyer are being held captive by the others while Syaid, Sun and Jin try to rescue them.  Much of the first half of the season focuses on this plotline and gives us a closer look at the inner circle of the others.  We learn more about Ben and his true motives.  We are also introduced to a new character, Juliet, a member of the others who may or may not be loyal to them.  Viewers are also introduced to Alex, the daughter Russo has been searching in vain for.The first half of the season focuses largely on Jack, Kate and Sawyer and their capture by the others.  I suspect that fans felt aggrivated by this since it took the focus off of the remainder of the survivors.  But it allowed the show to deepen its mysteries even further, to develop its three main characters more fully and to allow the audience to start to get an understanding of who the others are and what they are doing.The season's second half reunites the three with their island mates but continues to muddy the waters with the introduction of Richard, a member of the others whose role is unclear and who seems to never age.  We get some backstory regarding Ben's childhood where we finally see the Dharma Initiative in action as well as finding out what happened to them.  The mysterious Jacob, the never seen but revered leader of the others, is introduced into the plot as well.  Meanwhile, Desmond becomes a cast regular and gets an episode that shows what happened to him after the hatch exploded.  This episode not only deals with the ongoing theme of fate, but it also hints at the time travel element that will come to the forefront of the series down the road.  Elsewhere, Mr. Echo's time on the island comes to and end and Charlie learns what fate has in store for him.There's a lot to mull over in Season 3.  I haven't even mentioned the continuing identity struggle of Locke who eventually ends up joining the ranks of the others, or the sereis of events that brings Sawyer face to face with the man who was responsible for his parents' deaths.  Quite often, it can feel like the show is spinning its wheels; providing more questions than answers.  But be patient.  Season 3 is a dark, mystery filled journey that is extremely crucial to the show's story arc.  Even before arriving at the finale that changes everything, this season had already proven to anyone who had been paying attention, that Lost was about more than just survivors stranded on an island.  Something much bigger was happening to the surivors of Oceanic 815 and Season 3 is a major step towards figuring out exactly what that is.",5,Through the looking glass,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,3320,"['tag', 'line', 'review', 'title', 'finale', 'Season', '3', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'mind', 'bending', 'shocker', 'pointed', 'series', 'new', 'direction', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'endgame', 'would', 'begin', 'unfold', 'Season', '4', 'Yes', 'extremely', 'pivotal', 'episode', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'people', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'third', 'season', 'Critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'grew', 'extremely', 'frustrated', 'installment', 'series', 'only', 'jump', 'back', 'board', 'Lost', 'bandwagon', 'season', 'end', 'unfortunate', 'Season', '3', 'most', 'underrated', 'show', 'run', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best.The', 'season', 'where', 'season', '2', 'left', 'off', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'others', 'Syaid', 'Sun', 'Jin', 'try', 'rescue', 'Much', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'plotline', 'closer', 'look', 'inner', 'circle', 'others', 'learn', 'more', 'Ben', 'true', 'motives', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'Juliet', 'member', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'loyal', 'Viewers', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Alex', 'daughter', 'Russo', 'been', 'searching', 'vain', 'for.The', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'largely', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'capture', 'others', 'suspect', 'fans', 'felt', 'aggrivated', 'took', 'focus', 'remainder', 'survivors', 'allowed', 'show', 'deepen', 'mysteries', 'even', 'further', 'develop', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'fully', 'allow', 'audience', 'start', 'get', 'understanding', 'who', 'others', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'doing.The', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'three', 'island', 'mates', 'muddy', 'waters', 'introduction', 'Richard', 'member', 'others', 'role', 'unclear', 'who', 'never', 'age', 'get', 'backstory', 'regarding', 'Ben', 'childhood', 'where', 'finally', 'see', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'mysterious', 'Jacob', 'never', 'seen', 'revered', 'leader', 'others', 'introduced', 'plot', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'Desmond', 'cast', 'regular', 'episode', 'what', 'happened', 'hatch', 'exploded', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'ongoing', 'theme', 'fate', 'also', 'time', 'travel', 'element', 'will', 'come', 'forefront', 'series', 'down', 'road', 'Elsewhere', 'Mr.', 'Echo', 'time', 'island', 'end', 'Charlie', 'what', 'fate', 'store', 'him.There', 'lot', 'mull', 'over', 'Season', '3', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'continuing', 'identity', 'struggle', 'Locke', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'joining', 'ranks', 'others', 'sereis', 'events', 'Sawyer', 'face', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'parents', 'deaths', 'Quite', 'often', 'can', 'feel', 'show', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'providing', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'be', 'patient', 'Season', '3', 'dark', 'mystery', 'filled', 'journey', 'extremely', 'crucial', 'show', 'story', 'arc', 'Even', 'arriving', 'finale', 'everything', 'season', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'Lost', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'survivors', 'stranded', 'island', 'Something', 'much', 'bigger', 'was', 'happening', 'surivors', 'Oceanic', '815', 'Season', '3', 'major', 'step', 'towards', 'figuring', 'out', 'exactly', 'what']",Lost: Season 3

1068997,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B000P6YNSE,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[17, 28]","LOSTRather than review this show based on all the myriad of detailed plot points, which I know have been discussed in great detail here and elsewhere, I will rather concentrate on why LOST is so popular and what it is about the core concept in LOST that has viewers engaged in such an intelligent way.What is the core universal appeal of LOST?Now remember I am not attempting to answer the mysteries of the show although I may hit on answers in this short review.LOST has a great appeal to viewers because it serves as a metaphor for the great mysteries of existence. This is the fundamental appeal of the show.  In our, the viewers, day to day lives spirituality is mostly absent. All the religions we were raised on did a very poor job of catching up with the modern world and modern concepts so we mostly abandoned the religions we were raised on.Now, that is a bold statement so I will add that religions are not wrong, per say, they are just lacking modern analogies or metaphors to help us as people relate to the fundamental mysteries of the universe.Some films have become modern metaphors for this gap in relating to the mysteries of the universe. These films are very popular as a result of this underlying content being presented so well, and so basic that we mostly do not even notice why we enjoy the movie so much. Star Wars The Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix are three such epics that serve as fine examples of this. Sure many are critical of SW but it has a universal appeal and I feel that appeal is because it points to basic concepts such as fate, the forces of the universe, good and evil, and more. Despite it's childish content it still has tremendous appeal due to the basis of its mythology.The Lord of the Rings, while having been written long ago also has these basic concepts so it is also very popular. It was also done very well. That is also a requirement for appeal. People will not stand for schlock film making with attempted pseudo intellectual content. We flee from such garbage or imitations. If something is too esoteric it attracts fewer people. Take 2001 a Space Odyssey or The Fountain as such examples of films with similar basic concepts but lack mass appeal because they are too heavy handed for the masses.Now, on to the Matrix. These films serve as a prime example of melding very deep heavy concepts such as have been discussed and melding them with action, love, and characters that the masses find appealing and combining it all together into a very brilliant metaphor for the deeper mysteries of the universe.I will mention Joseph Campbell here. He is worth reading and if you have read this far in my comments. He is the starting point for anyone who is unhappy with religion and seeks deeper answers. He is also a must read for writers and creative types alike. I fall into both categories and was introduced to him by my best friend. There are others like him out there but he was my gate to a larger understanding so starting with him is a good choice.Whether or not LOST ends brilliantly right now is irrelevant. The show has mass appeal due to the fact that the island is in the back of our minds a micro verse metaphor for the greater mysteries of the universe.Now how the show may end and what the secrets eventually are, are all speculation. There are however certain concepts, some of which have already been discredited, that would be lame.To me there are only really two tiers of possible universal endings that would be satisfying for me. Now true brilliance occurs when something I have not thought of is presented and is more brilliant and fantastic than anything that has been discussed of thought of. The show could end like this. Tier one for me as possible endings will be if the explanations given for all the mysteries on the show will be answered with the island being something alluding to existence, God, and the like. I am hoping that it will end more along the lines of a 2001 type ending than some silly, ""We were all dreaming"" Pincher Martin type ending.Tier two as far as possible endings go, and what will ultimately be satisfying but not as satisfying as my afore mentioned tire one, could be some sort of very government / illuminati / conspiracy / rouge all controlling group of humans. A kind of ""we run the planet"" or ""We invented the island"" or ""We are in Charge"" type group.As far as I am concerned the more esoteric God / power / mysterious universe power, (for lack of better term) fundamental answers will be the most satisfying because I believe that is why the show is appealing. To give answers less than my tire one ending would be less than satisfying.Now the show has another great vehicle that helps viewers to relate to the show and this is very obvious. These are all the characters. There is someone for everyone on LOST. No matter who you are there is a basic archetypal character there for you to relate to. The fact that Hurley saved the day in this season's finale is proof positive of this. The shows creators know this is a very basic reason why we like the show.  The esoteric stuff is there as a lure, the characters are there for us to individually relate to the lure. We all see ourselves in different aspects of each character. None of us is perfect and neither are the shows characters. Some of us do not know who we are until we are in certain situations and we decide how to act. This is played out time and again on LOST. Choice and fate. Engaging the universe or waiting for the universe to engage you. These concepts go back to Joseph Campbell and the Matrix. Are we in control or are we being controlled? As far as real actual non-TV reality goes I feel it's a bit of both. I feel that engaging the world and making choices helps fate work it's magic. While if we sit back and do nothing and play it too safe fate will take a back seat to your path in life and you will go nowhere and do nothing and be unsatisfied and not know why. LOST hits on these fundamental concepts which are with each and every one of us every day. Whether or not we believe in them matters not. They are buried in the back of our minds and we do not even know they are there. They operate in all of us just the same. If a show or film hits on them we light up and react positively and watch with baited breath till it ends.LOST, no matter how it ends is popular for the above-mentioned reasons. I hope the show stays brilliant. I hope the show ends brilliant and I hope it leads to more works of this type. Creative works like LOST allude to what is so fascinating about the very nature of existence. I feel we, as humans tend to overlook these mysteries, which surround us every day and every second. Good works of art are there to point to those mysteries. Films mostly, and now TV somewhat, are the modern vehicles to help us see these mysteries and point our way to deeper and more satisfying lives.Thanks for reading this.Carbonadam",5,The Universal

Sure we can knock the show for drawing out its answers a bit too long and revisiting might lose that mystery because we now know what it all means, it's always great to get immersed into a show that doesn't involve a crime being solved in an hour. But even the great shows stumble and season 3 is one season where there's enough promise and greatness to outweigh the flaws but just too bad the flaws are just so visible.Season 3 opens with Jack, Kate and Sawyer held hostage by the Others; Sayid, Sun and Jin are on a sailboat attempting to rescue them while Locke and Desmond deal with the fallout of the electromagnetic explosion that happened at the hatch. But naturally there's plenty to branch off from as answers (some) are revealed, new ones are introduced and some characters won't survive till the end.I tried to be as broad and general as I can since the fun of a show like this is getting caught up in it and not really worrying that you've watched a good number of episodes in one go. And watching it on DVD or Blu-ray helps the flow of the season well since disappointment isn't as easy to get when you don't have to wait a week or deal with frequent commercial interruptions. A lot happens in this season, some of it surprising and some...strange but the show creators don't so much stumble as they occasionally drop the ball then bounce back.The first ball drop is the opening set of episodes before a long break which dealt rather heavily on Jack, Kate and Sawyer's time in captivity with the Others. While it introduces their society and some motivations and a new main character, it feels strangely sluggish and the show just kind of limps along for awhile. Then there's the new characters Nikki and Paulo which deserve their dislike from fans since it seemed like a good idea to try rather than something vitally integral to the show. But then the show gets into the swing of things and twists add plenty of fuel for the mythology and the 2 part finale is quite the whopper for changing the show around. But as you can probably guess, some of the answers seem slightly frustrating as if the show's winking at us in a ""this is all you're getting"" way. One of the mysteries surrounding the Others was their kidnapping of several flight survivors and the reveal or shall we say, the tease, of what happens to them is just silly.There's a lot of episodes that are great here to exceptional to just merely serviceable. Ones like ""Man Behind the Curtain"" (complete with creepy late night cabin visit), ""Man From Tallahassee"" and the 2 part ""Through the Looking Glass"" are season highlights and it's worth checking out the season if you're a Lost fan.

The thing is, the plots in this, ""the captivity season,"" are so fast-paced and enthrallingly good, it's not only forgivable, it's a great ride! Answering the season two cliffhanger's burning question of what the heck happens now, the third season takes off like a rocket with Jack, Sawyer and Claire captives of the sinister ""Others"" whose brief onscreen moments in seasons one and two never hinted at the extent to which this society is entrenched on the island, or how advanced the Others are. Season three travels in many directions and for once answers more questions than it raises: a rarity in Lost. It is also possibly the most tragic season, with the loss of one particular cast member somehow hitting harder than any of the many deaths in the show to date. The introduction of Juliet Burke, the quiet, unflinchingly pragmatic fertility doctor and oft-dubbed ""scariest person ever on Lost"" was probably the highlight of the season, though the fault lines developing among the loyalties of the original Oceanic survivors brought out a soap operatic quality that was one more reason to tune in. Among the special features, the most winsome is probably Evangeline Lilly's behind the scenes moments with the numerous vital but seldom seen crewmembers whose labor brings Lost to the screen.

The hatch violently imploded, and Kate, Sawyer and Jack were captured by the Others.And so the third season is all about the repercussions of those events. It lags badly in the first half, but shocking predictions and new arrivals on the island add fresh twists -- and some stunning answers -- to the twisty, surreal storyline. But there's still plenty left for the remaining three seasons.Kate and Sawyer are put to work, then locked up in gorilla cages, while Jack is similarly imprisoned inside an Other compound -- and finds that he is there to be a doctor to the sinister Ben, who is suffering from a spinal tumor. Jack finds himself suspended between two Others -- Ben and the mysterious Juliet -- and unsure what to do, or who to trust.The tensions between the Others and castaways become worse as Kate and Sawyer escape, and she mounts a rescue to find Jack. But even when they get him (and the disgraced Juliet) back, things don't improve -- Juliet is secretly spying for Ben, Desmond has terrible visions of Charlie's demise, and the newly solo Locke forces Ben to reveal the island's greatest secret -- Jacob, a mysterious power that commands the Others like a god.Suddenly a woman parachutes onto the island, and tells the castaways that a ship is only a few miles out to sea. As the Others fragment and turn against each other, the survivors decide to take them out once and for all, while Charlie and Desmond set off to infiltrate an underwater hatch. But there will be shocking losses on both sides, as Jack is faced with the most important decision he may ever make....""Lost"" still has plenty of unsolved, unanswered mysteries, and the first half of the season is frustratingly slow and oblique. No answers, at all. But it picks up and answers questions in the second half, including who ruined Sawyer's life, who commands the Others, and the relationship between Dharma Corporation and the Others and why they protect the island so fiercely.The writing for the first half is pretty lax (major questions are answered with non-answers like ""We watch""), but later on it tightens up considerably, with dozens of seemingly unrelated plot threads coming together in the battle with the Others. Locke's dad, Desmond's checkered past, Rousseau's daughter and Sun's pregnancy are only a few of them.But despite all the personal drama (enough about the love triangle!), the stories are still full of gritty action (including Sayid killing a man with just his feet), and increasingly twisted flashbacks that let us see the pre-crash lives of the islanders. These had gotten kinda stale, but Desmond's timeslip makes it seem fresher, as does the revelation of how Ben became King of the Magic Island. It answers a lot of questions too.And there's the occasional loss. Two beloved characters bite the big one in this season, and the handling of their deaths is enough to bring tears to your eyes. But there's some humor as well -- usually provided by Hurley, who revives an old van, triumphs at Ping-pong, and even gets to be the rescuing cavalry. Not to mention the wry, solid dialogue ("" If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now"").Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly turn in some solid performances as the increasingly tormented castaways. But Dominic Monaghan and Henry Ian Cusick really rule the acting front, with their poignant struggles with love for their respective girlfriends, and the angst that Desmond's visions bring to them both. And Josh Holloway does a brilliant job, especially in the harrowing, claustrophobic episode in ""The Brig.""The first half of ""Lost's"" third season is decidedly tepid -- not terrible, but flabby. But when it tightens up again, this tense series blossoms out. It'll be a long wait until season four.",4,We have to go back,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,3832,"['Lost', 'ended', 'second', 'season', 'bang', 'literally', 'hatch', 'violently', 'imploded', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'Jack', 'were', 'captured', 'Others.And', 'third', 'season', 'repercussions', 'events', 'badly', 'first', 'half', 'shocking', 'predictions', 'new', 'arrivals', 'island', 'add', 'fresh', 'twists', 'stunning', 'answers', 'twisty', 'surreal', 'storyline', 'still', 'plenty', 'left', 'remaining', 'three', 'seasons.Kate', 'Sawyer', 'are', 'put', 'work', 'then', 'locked', 'up', 'gorilla', 'cages', 'Jack', 'similarly', 'imprisoned', 'Other', 'compound', 'there', 'be', 'doctor', 'sinister', 'Ben', 'who', 'suffering', 'spinal', 'tumor', 'Jack', 'suspended', 'two', 'Others', 'Ben', 'mysterious', 'Juliet', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'trust.The', 'tensions', 'Others', 'become', 'worse', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'escape', 'rescue', 'find', 'Jack', 'even', 'when', 'get', 'disgraced', 'Juliet', 'back', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'improve', 'Juliet', 'secretly', 'spying', 'Ben', 'Desmond', 'terrible', 'visions', 'Charlie', 'demise', 'newly', 'solo', 'Locke', 'forces', 'Ben', 'reveal', 'island', 'greatest', 'secret', 'Jacob', 'mysterious', 'power', 'Others', 'god.Suddenly', 'woman', 'island', 'castaways', 'ship', 'only', 'few', 'miles', 'out', 'sea', 'Others', 'fragment', 'turn', 'other', 'survivors', 'decide', 'take', 'out', 'once', 'Charlie', 'Desmond', 'set', 'off', 'infiltrate', 'underwater', 'hatch', 'will', 'be', 'shocking', 'losses', 'sides', 'Jack', 'faced', 'most', 'important', 'decision', 'may', 'ever', 'make', 'Lost', 'still', 'plenty', 'unsolved', 'unanswered', 'mysteries', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'frustratingly', 'slow', 'oblique', 'answers', 'up', 'answers', 'questions', 'second', 'half', 'including', 'who', 'ruined', 'Sawyer', 'life', 'who', 'Others', 'relationship', 'Dharma', 'Corporation', 'Others', 'why', 'protect', 'island', 'so', 'fiercely.The', 'writing', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'lax', 'major', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'non-answers', 'watch', 'later', 'up', 'considerably', 'dozens', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'plot', 'threads', 'coming', 'together', 'battle', 'Others', 'Locke', 'dad', 'Desmond', 'checkered', 'past', 'Rousseau', 'daughter', 'Sun', 'pregnancy', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'them.But', 'personal', 'drama', 'enough', 'love', 'triangle', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'full', 'gritty', 'action', 'including', 'Sayid', 'killing', 'man', 'just', 'feet', 'increasingly', 'twisted', 'flashbacks', 'let', 'see', 'pre-crash', 'lives', 'islanders', 'had', 'gotten', 'kinda', 'stale', 'Desmond', 'timeslip', 'seem', 'fresher', 'revelation', 'how', 'Ben', 'became', 'King', 'Magic', 'Island', 'lot', 'questions', 'too.And', 'occasional', 'loss', 'Two', 'beloved', 'characters', 'bite', 'big', 'one', 'season', 'handling', 'deaths', 'enough', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'provided', 'Hurley', 'who', 'old', 'van', 'triumphs', 'Ping-pong', 'even', 'be', 'rescuing', 'cavalry', 'Not', 'mention', 'wry', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'was', 'Rousseau', 'massive', 'rock', 'would', 'be', 'flying', 'head', 'right', 'now', '.Matthew', 'Fox', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'increasingly', 'tormented', 'castaways', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'really', 'acting', 'front', 'poignant', 'struggles', 'love', 'respective', 'girlfriends', 'angst', 'Desmond', 'visions', 'bring', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'brilliant', 'job', 'especially', 'harrowing', 'claustrophobic', 'episode', 'Brig', 'first', 'half', 'Lost', 'third', 'season', 'decidedly', 'tepid', 'not', 'terrible', 'flabby', 'when', 'up', 'again', 'tense', 'series', 'blossoms', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'long', 'wait', 'season', 'four']",Lost: Season 3

1069026,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000P6YNSE,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[0, 0]","After the utter lostness of Season 2, watching the first 6 or 7 episodes, you'd think you have been caught in a time-warp where Season 2 never died. But don't worry folks, the brutal tediousness of the beginning of the season was not to keep this season down, and in fact, it's provided the show some of its best & most underrated moments in the history of the show. Sure, it may be small pieces in a big puzzle, but almost every minute of the 2nd half of this season is simply enthralling.Highlight Episodes:Flashes Before Your EyesThe Man from TallahasseeExpos&eacute;The Man Behind the CurtainThrough the Looking GlassSeason 3 is all about those mysterious Others, a group with the weirdest sense of motives, or lack thereof ever conceived on television. For the first 6 episodes, you got intimate knowledge of their polar bear cages, and the general complex of the zoological facility, which you would never really see again. But hey, you got a lot of tedious dialogue, a lot of Jack being stupid, Kate being the point in a love triangle/quadrangle. Make no mistake about it, if you did not watch these episodes back to back through the wonders of DVD, I feel sorry for you. It's hard enough dealing with this tediousness over a night, much less months.But again, all is not Lost, because the producers saw the error in their Season 2-type ways, and sought to correct them. We got some Desmond flash-forwarding with one of the most emotional moments the serious produced up until that point. We got some AWESOME Locke dialogue and interactions with Ben Linus, including a lot of Ben Linus vs. John Locke.And then of course, we have Nikki & Paulo. Oh, that infamous duo that was so eloquently summed up by Sawyer as, ""Who the hell are you?"" Sure, I wanted to slap them every moment they were breathing until they got an episode of their own, but once they did get a flashback episode, one could consider it one of the worst Lost episodes of all time, or one of its worst. There was strippers fighting crime, hilarious flashbacks that tried REALLY hard to show that this duo was there the WHOLE time (What? You didn't see them in the background doing nothing?), and really atrocious dialogue/acting. I mean, they even conceived an excuse for why Paulo was going to the bathroom in almost every previous scene we had seen him in before! But alas, these truly awful, annoying characters were literally buried alive, set to some of the most inappropriate clapping I've ever done. Oh, Nikki & Paulo, how will I ever get by without you? Just fine actually.Heck, the producers actually made Charlie likable again, right before they killed him off. I mean, they tried so hard to make him a jerk last season, and here he is making the top 5 moments of his life, and heck, we actually like him again! What's worse is, we genuinely root for him! Oh, how easy we forget. Sure, Jack & Kate are basically the same as last season, continuing their characters' downward spiral. But hey, Sawyer is as hilarious as ever, Hurley is as lovable as ever, and hey, we finally did away with full-time flashbacks! Oh Lost, how far you came in such a short span of time.Overall, watching this season is one of the most satisfying of the show, especially since you get such plentiful, awesome moments after sitting through so much tediousness at the beginning. Underrated, Season 3 will always have a special place in my heart, if only for the reason that it truly made what Lost became later.",4,"""Where Do You Get Electricity?""

1069031,A1TQAK53H2LT5Q,B000P6YNSE,H. Heavens,"[22, 27]","Let me just start by saying i have never liked movies about being stranded on an island. Blue Lagoon, Castaway etc etc, i avoid those movies like the plague, why? Lets just say growing up in Chicago i have become used to urban enviroments and movies in general with a lot of stuff going on. How much can possibly go on when stranded on an island, fish? Swim away from sharks? Building a fire? Don't get me wrong, i like character development as much as the next person (never seen a lord of the flies movie but i read the book and did enjoy it, but thats the only stranded scenario i have ever gotten into) but i just couldnt buy the old grass huts and spear fishing cliche over and over again.So what made me start watching Lost, i hate to say that into the third season i saw a commerical with Evangeline Lily in it and thought to myself, a show with a girl that fine in it has to be at least decent, if anything maybe i could catch some rainy scenes with her in it. So i downloaded the season premiere of season 3, a tale of 2 cities. When i saw the airplane going down after the others (didnt know at the time) came out of their houses i was just blowned away. For one, i thought it was just about a deserted island, instead i get people walking out a neigborhood that looks like surburbia in any ol city. So i thought to myself after watching the episode only one thing.....""I have to get the first 2 seasons Now"".Now after being completely won over by the cast of lost for 2 seasons i jumped right back where i left off, the second episode of the 3rd season. Now i heard many reviews about how weak the first 6 episodes are. While it was nothing compared to the second half of the season, it was just basically giving a little insight into who the others really were. The whole dynamic between Jack and Julia is particularly fascinating, simply because Jack never truly falls for Julia like he has fallen for Kate, Julia however falls head over heels for Jack. The fact that they shared the most important bond (getting off the island) drew them closer together.I enjoyed the episode when Ben shows jack the footage of the world series with Boston winning and the Look on Jack's face is probably the most stunning/revealing Look on the entire run of the show, You feel Jack's Pain that he can't get home but he realizes the world is still going on and it fuels him to do whatever is neccesary. The season picks up like a runaway train with the return of Lost that came on at 10:00pm est.  Now, Lost is one of the only shows that can get away with coming on so late..10o'clock at night on the east coast, i am usually in bed by 9:30 and you want me to stay awake till 11:00pm. But you know what...i did it anyway, they could show this show at 3:00am and i would set my alarm  clock to watch this outstanding show.  Honestly, in my humble opinion their was not one weak episode in the whole season, even the episode ""expose"" which people seem to loathe for some reason i found enjoyable, sure not as much as others but the ending alone made a chill just go up my spine.Lost is like crack to me, if i miss an episode i am downloading it the next day just so i can watch it, i am addicted and i will be addicted until my friends get off that darn island, and when they do, thats when i'll be in tears because this show that has brought me so much entertainment will finally be over.....thank goodness for dvd's.",5,"If being LOST is wrong, I don't wanna be right.",1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,3413,"['Let', 'just', 'start', 'saying', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'movies', 'being', 'stranded', 'island', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Castaway', 'etc', 'etc', 'i', 'avoid', 'movies', 'plague', 'why', 'just', 'say', 'growing', 'up', 'Chicago', 'i', 'have', 'become', 'used', 'urban', 'enviroments', 'movies', 'general', 'lot', 'stuff', 'going', 'How', 'much', 'can', 'possibly', 'go', 'when', 'stranded', 'island', 'fish', 'Swim', 'away', 'sharks', 'Building', 'fire', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'character', 'development', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'never', 'seen', 'lord', 'flies', 'movie', 'i', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'enjoy', 'only', 'stranded', 'scenario', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'gotten', 'i', 'just', 'couldnt', 'buy', 'old', 'grass', 'huts', 'spear', 'fishing', 'cliche', 'again.So', 'what', 'made', 'start', 'watching', 'Lost', 'i', 'hate', 'say', 'third', 'season', 'i', 'saw', 'commerical', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'thought', 'myself', 'show', 'girl', 'fine', 'be', 'least', 'decent', 'anything', 'maybe', 'i', 'could', 'catch', 'rainy', 'scenes', 'So', 'i', 'downloaded', 'season', 'premiere', 'season', '3', 'tale', '2', 'cities', 'When', 'i', 'saw', 'airplane', 'going', 'down', 'others', 'didnt', 'know', 'time', 'came', 'houses', 'i', 'was', 'just', 'blowned', 'away', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'deserted', 'island', 'instead', 'i', 'get', 'people', 'walking', 'out', 'neigborhood', 'surburbia', 'ol', 'city', 'i', 'thought', 'myself', 'watching', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'thing', '..', 'have', 'get', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'Now', '.Now', 'being', 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'cast', 'lost', '2', 'seasons', 'i', 'jumped', 'right', 'back', 'where', 'i', 'left', 'off', 'second', 'episode', '3rd', 'season', 'Now', 'i', 'heard', 'many', 'reviews', 'how', 'weak', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'are', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'basically', 'giving', 'little', 'insight', 'who', 'others', 'really', 'were', 'whole', 'dynamic', 'Jack', 'Julia', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'simply', 'Jack', 'never', 'truly', 'Julia', 'fallen', 'Kate', 'Julia', 'however', 'head', 'heels', 'Jack', 'fact', 'shared', 'most', 'important', 'bond', 'getting', 'off', 'island', 'drew', 'closer', 'together.I', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'when', 'Ben', 'jack', 'footage', 'world', 'series', 'Boston', 'winning', 'Look', 'Jack', 'face', 'probably', 'most', 'stunning/revealing', 'Look', 'entire', 'run', 'show', 'feel', 'Jack', 'Pain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'home', 'world', 'still', 'going', 'do', 'neccesary', 'season', 'up', 'runaway', 'train', 'return', 'Lost', 'came', '10:00pm', 'est', 'Now', 'Lost', 'one', 'only', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'coming', ""late..10o'clock"", 'night', 'east', 'coast', 'i', 'am', 'usually', 'bed', '9:30', 'want', 'stay', 'awake', 'till', '11:00pm', 'know', 'what', 'i', 'did', 'anyway', 'could', 'show', 'show', '3:00am', 'i', 'would', 'set', 'alarm', 'clock', 'watch', 'outstanding', 'show', 'Honestly', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'weak', 'episode', 'whole', 'season', 'even', 'episode', 'expose', 'people', 'seem', 'loathe', 'reason', 'i', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'sure', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'ending', 'alone', 'made', 'chill', 'just', 'go', 'up', 'spine.Lost', 'crack', 'i', 'miss', 'episode', 'i', 'am', 'downloading', 'next', 'day', 'just', 'so', 'i', 'can', 'watch', 'am', 'addicted', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'addicted', 'friends', 'get', 'darn', 'island', 'when', 'do', 'thats', 'when', 'i', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tears', 'show', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'entertainment', 'will', 'finally', 'be', '..thank', 'goodness', 'dvd']",Lost: Season 3

I never followed this series in broadcast and finally, with the final few episodes left to air, I finally broke down and started watching it on DVD. This show more than deserves its addictive yet similtaneously frustrating reputation. Featuring some of the best acting ever on television by a remarkable and constantly rotating ensemble cast, it also has its share of moments that inspire sheer incredulity. Frankly, if this were just a tale of castaways on a normal tropical island without the mystical/scientific overtones, I'd probably like it even better, since paranormal has never been my bag. But I hang on for the moments that are anchored in something resembling reality and our stellar cast does not disappoint. Hands down my favorite season to date, I have a feeling that the subsequent three seasons might find it hard to match this level. And I have settled on my favorite castaways out of our overstuffed cast: sexy conman/cowboy with an unexpected bookworm side, Sawyer (Josh Holloway, he of the roguish dimples) and tortured Cassandra, Desmond, (Henry Ian Cusick, yet another sexy Scottish export). The always excellent Michael Emerson as the diabolical (or is he?) Ben Linus has given the show a much-needed shot in the arm since his introduction last season and provides a counterpoint energy to our original castaways, some of whom have become rather tedious through familiarity.  We also get to meet beguiling Other, Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) who is playing both sides now--which side will finally come down on?  Particularly strong episodes this go-round are ""The Man From Tallahassee"", in which we find out how Locke came to be in that wheelchair; ""The Brig"", in which Sawyer comes face-to-face with his nemesis, the original ""Sawyer"", and discovers a bond with Locke that neither knew existed; and ""The Man Behind the Curtain"", which explores the origin and backstory of Ben Linus, and how he came to be the leader of the Others.  During the two-part finale, ""Through the Looking Glass"" we say goodbye permanently to one of our castaways and I'm equally sad to say goodbye to Season Three because I don't know how they are going to top it.  All indications are that they can't, and they don't succeed.  However, because this series is video crack and I can't stop watching, I have duly started Season Four.

The title of my review is a quote from ""Full Metal Jacket"" but in this case refers to the long gosh darn time I've had to wait for ""Lost's"" return.  Most shows would have lost me due to aggravation half way through this waiting period.  But ""Lost"" is so good and the season ending so great that I am still eagerly anticipating January 31st.The DVD set has some really nice features including commentary that tells you things you really want to know, and featurettes with really nice background pieces on all the crew not just the stars.  The interface on the last DVD is a little aggravating since you can't seem to activate parts of it.  Perhaps there are ""Easter Eggs"" there but I'm not smart enough to get into them.

1069036,A1A535W556ROBQ,B000P6YNSE,James Ferguson,"[2, 3]","Season three more or less completes a cycle, as island life is changed forever with the set of events that unfold.  Overall, it was a pretty good season.  Certainly plenty of action leading to a fitting season finale in which the viewer discovers the last of the old Dharma stations as Des and Charlie try to open up a line of communication to the outside world.  But, it is the bumpy and confused set of episodes one has come to expect from this series.The viewer learns quite a bit about the Others to whet his appetite.  New characters emerge while others meet their fate on the island.  Locke becomes obsessed in the meaning of the island which takes many twists and turns, leaving Jack in a quandry as to what Locke is really after.The writers struggle to hold all these competing storylines together.  It would seem there are just too many characters with a lot of moving back and forth between the various camps that have emerged.  Much of the mystery is gone, leaving one to wonder what if any metaphysical aspect to this series remains.  But, the writers still want you to believe something deeper lurks at the heart of the island so they pull out Ol' Smokie a few more times and provide some other interesting clues to the island.If you've been sucked into this series, you can't stop now, but in many ways Season Three represented the peak of the series.",4,White Rabbit,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,1365,"['Season', 'three', 'more', 'less', 'completes', 'cycle', 'island', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'set', 'events', 'unfold', 'Overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'season', 'Certainly', 'plenty', 'action', 'leading', 'fitting', 'season', 'finale', 'viewer', 'last', 'old', 'Dharma', 'stations', 'Des', 'Charlie', 'try', 'open', 'up', 'line', 'communication', 'outside', 'world', 'bumpy', 'confused', 'set', 'episodes', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'series.The', 'viewer', 'quite', 'bit', 'Others', 'whet', 'appetite', 'New', 'characters', 'emerge', 'others', 'meet', 'fate', 'island', 'Locke', 'obsessed', 'meaning', 'island', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'leaving', 'Jack', 'quandry', 'what', 'Locke', 'really', 'after.The', 'writers', 'struggle', 'hold', 'competing', 'storylines', 'together', 'would', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'lot', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'various', 'camps', 'have', 'emerged', 'Much', 'mystery', 'gone', 'leaving', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'metaphysical', 'aspect', 'series', 'writers', 'still', 'want', 'believe', 'something', 'deeper', 'lurks', 'heart', 'island', 'pull', 'out', 'Ol', 'Smokie', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'provide', 'other', 'interesting', 'clues', 'island.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sucked', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'now', 'many', 'ways', 'Season', 'Three', 'represented', 'peak', 'series']",Lost: Season 3
1069037,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B000P6YNSE,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","SPOILER ALERT: If you have not seen the first two seasons of Lost you may want to wait to read this review. This will either give things away, or confuse you as you watch the first two seasons.Things start to really heat up on the island as Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) find themselves prisoners of ""The Others"", who might need more from them than they're letting on. As for the other survivors of Oceanic 815, Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Locke (Terry O' Quinn) find another hatch which may prove that pushing a button every 108 minutes in the first hatch is futile. Could ""The Others"" be their chance to get off the island? Why hasn't anyone come to save the survivors of Oceanic 815? Where did ""The Others"" come from? What will happen if they don't push that button? What is the purpose of the Dharma Initiative? Some of these questions will be answered, and so many more will be asked by the end of the third season!The first two seasons of Lost don't even begin to prepare you for what comes next, which is fine by me! One of the great things about Lost is it's compelling storyline that always keeps you guessing, and as time goes by I, all at once, feel that I wish I would have seen this when it first aired on TV and that I'm glad I waited. Watching all of this at once means that I don't have to wait after an episode to see what's going to happen next, but at the same time I can't really talk to anyone who's already seen the series about what happened in the episode I watched last night because they're already way beyond that. But here I am, a little closer to getting caught up with the series.After season 2 which really felt more like a place holder between seasons 1 and 3, season 3 really gets the ball rolling on what the show's really about. Unlike the previous 2 seasons, season 3 might introduce you to new characters, but because those characters are meant to be shrouded in secrecy it doesn't do much to really introduce them. This lack of introduction allows the story to propel forward faster than the previous two seasons. Not only do you get flashbacks in season 3, but now you have flash forwards as well. The way that everything's set up is brilliant storytelling, even if it doesn't give you the satisfaction of a quick and easy payoff.More new characters are added to the roster this season, most of which aren't really explained too much as they serve the purpose of fleshing out characters in flashbacks and flash forwards, or to further the story of ""The Others"". Of these new characters Elizabeth Mitchell (V, Gia) as Juliet is the most important. Of course, there's always the stand outs in the crowd, and Terry O' Quinn continues to shine as John Locke, but in his first full season Michael Emerson as the oily Benjamin Linus upstages everyone. As a master manipulator bending everyone to his needs, Michael Emerson is the true star of this season.As with season 2 there is a slight problem of some characters doing things that seem to be more about moving the story along rather than being in the best interest of what the characters would or wouldn't do. While not as bad as the second season in this aspect, it can still be distracting as you move along through the series. Of course, this isn't a major problem, as the twists and turns of the plot may leave you more distracted than the character's acting against type at times, and those twists and turns keep your further invested in the story.In my opinion, season 3 is really where Lost kicks off. The first two seasons get you into the characters, but the third season starts to answer some of the questions and pushes you into the direction of where everything is heading. Of course, by the end you'll probably be asking more questions than what you had answered, but the intrigue will leave you hungry for more.4.5/5",4,Lost Season 3,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,3870,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'read', 'review', 'will', 'either', 'give', 'things', 'away', 'confuse', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.Things', 'start', 'really', 'heat', 'up', 'island', 'Jack', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Sawyer', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'Kate', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'find', 'prisoners', 'Others', 'who', 'might', 'need', 'more', ""'re"", 'letting', 'other', 'survivors', 'Oceanic', '815', 'Mr.', 'Eko', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'Locke', 'Terry', 'O', 'Quinn', 'find', 'hatch', 'may', 'prove', 'pushing', 'button', '108', 'minutes', 'first', 'hatch', 'futile', 'Could', 'Others', 'be', 'chance', 'get', 'off', 'island', 'Why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'come', 'save', 'survivors', 'Oceanic', '815', 'Where', 'did', 'Others', 'come', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'button', 'What', 'purpose', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'asked', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'prepare', 'what', 'next', 'fine', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'Lost', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'always', 'guessing', 'time', 'once', 'feel', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'Watching', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'episode', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'anyone', 'who', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'what', 'happened', 'episode', 'watched', 'last', 'night', ""'re"", 'already', 'way', 'here', 'am', 'little', 'closer', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'series.After', 'season', '2', 'really', 'felt', 'more', 'place', 'holder', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'season', '3', 'really', 'ball', 'rolling', 'what', 'show', 'really', 'about', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'season', '3', 'might', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'shrouded', 'secrecy', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'really', 'introduce', 'lack', 'introduction', 'story', 'propel', 'forward', 'faster', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'season', '3', 'now', 'have', 'flash', 'forwards', 'well', 'way', 'everything', 'set', 'up', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'even', ""n't"", 'give', 'satisfaction', 'quick', 'easy', 'payoff.More', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'added', 'roster', 'season', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'explained', 'too', 'much', 'serve', 'purpose', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'further', 'story', 'Others', 'new', 'characters', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'V', 'Gia', 'Juliet', 'most', 'important', 'course', 'always', 'stand', 'crowd', 'Terry', 'O', 'Quinn', 'shine', 'John', 'Locke', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'oily', 'Benjamin', 'Linus', 'everyone', 'master', 'manipulator', 'bending', 'everyone', 'needs', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'true', 'star', 'season.As', 'season', '2', 'slight', 'problem', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'moving', 'story', 'rather', 'being', 'best', 'interest', 'what', 'characters', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'second', 'season', 'aspect', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'distracting', 'move', 'along', 'series', 'course', ""n't"", 'major', 'problem', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'may', 'leave', 'more', 'distracted', 'character', 'acting', 'type', 'times', 'twists', 'keep', 'further', 'invested', 'story.In', 'opinion', 'season', '3', 'really', 'where', 'Lost', 'kicks', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'get', 'characters', 'third', 'season', 'answer', 'questions', 'pushes', 'direction', 'where', 'everything', 'heading', 'course', 'end', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'asking', 'more', 'questions', 'what', 'had', 'answered', 'intrigue', 'will', 'leave', 'hungry', 'more.4.5/5']",Lost: Season 3

I'll do my best not to mention specifics.I'd heard grumblings about sesaon 2 of this show hitting a slump, which baffled me; it kept me fascinated and engaged the whole time.Season 3 keep up the momentum.  In addition to strong plots (spine-tingling twists and turns, I kid you not; whose heart is not pumping in episode 6 when Jack screams ""Run, Kate! Run!!"" in the climax?), the characters are fleshed out in a real way.  Think of your own secrets in life, the things you've done of which you're not proud: the LOST characters backgrounds are explored and, for me at least, seem so real and human I can identify because of my own past regrets.  Whether you love, hate, or feel apathy for these characters, they are REAL.This, of course, is largely to the strong talents of the actors (and much to do with the directors as well).  Stand-outs are Yunjin Kim, as she struggles with her cultural role as a Korean woman, yet an obviously strong person; Evangeline Lilly, whose beauty doesn't detract from her fierceness; Matthew Fox, whose goes deeper into character as a brilliant, clever man with a dark side; Terry O'Quinn, who finally won an Emmy (side note: I don't understand why more of the actors do not receive individual accolades for their work from these organizations that distribute awards), who constantly keeps us wondering if his intentions are good or bad - is he a hero or villain?; Michael Emerson, whose Ben is sheer creepiness as control freak; and ESPECIALLY Elizabeth Mitchell whose cool, bordering on cold, calmness hides depths of despair we can only guess at.(I will add that I am looking forward to another strong actor's return to season 4: Harold Perrineau - his Michael was heartbreaking and lovable.)When you buy these DVDs, plan to set aside free time on a weekend or holiday when you do not have to stop watching.

Desmond - he is the wild card. When he's not busy with preventing the Island's destruction, he can see the future in the form of FLASHES.3. Dharma Initiative - we get to see who they were and what they did. More stations are discovered and more Island territory is seen. Also, we get to see what happened to the DI.4.

It starts out slow in the beginning and Lost some fans complained about the season premiere being disapointing because not much happened. But Lost fans complain about everything really. When the show doesn't give answers...they complain...when the show does give answers...they complain that the gave too many answers. Oh plus they always complain about it's breaks. It took like 3 months off to satisfy fans that were complaining about it taking a break, coming back and then taking another break and another. Of course they still complained about the 3 month break though lol. Plus next season, the show won't be back until January, I wonder how much whining that's gonna cause.Anyway the season starts off at the camp of the Others with Jack locked in his own room while Sawyer and Kate are locked in seperate large cages. Jack meets Juliet who brings him food and also obviously did her research on him. She also trys hard to gain his trust and I'm still not sure if he's a fool or not for buying into it evntually. Eko also has to be rescued early in the season by Locke who mysteriously lost his voice for a brief time after th hatch explosion. Sadly though the awseome Mr. Eko dies like an episode later after Locke rescues him from Polar bears. The black fog disguised as his brother tests him and he fails the test obviously. It sucks that he dies but the scene is done sooo creepy that it's satisfying anyway. That is if you can get passed that it's sorta silly that the fog takes the form of a giant hand and picks Eko up and tosses him around violently.You also have some pretty mysterious but cool stuff going on with Desmond who has an odd new gift of knowing what will happen next after the hatch blast. He has visions of Charlie dieing and does everything he can to stop that from happening. You also have Jack having to decide whether or not if he wants to perform a surgery that will save Ben's life from a tumor. But since Jack is a smart guy, he realizes he can use that to his advantage. As he threatens not to save Ben if the Others don't let Kate and Sawyer go. Which is good for Sawyer since one guy that had his g/f killed by Sun  for some reason thinks that killing Sawyer will get him revenge.We also get some awesome stuff with Hurley finding out something shocking about the plane survivors and finding out how Locke got crippled. We also find out who it is that conned Sawyer's parents and Sawyer gets his deserved revenge. You won't shed a tear though because the guy is pretty evil and has it coming. Since what he did to Sawyer's parents was hardly the worse thing he has done. We also find out that Jack and Claire are infact related and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You also get to know the Others a bit more as well and get a creepy scene where Ben introduces Locke to the mysterious Jacob.

1069043,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B000P6YNSE,JMM,"[0, 0]","Season 3 of Lost is my least favorite season of the show so far, but that's not to say it is bad. It still has it moments of greatness. The first half of the season deals with our main castaways being held captive by the Others. Kate and Sawyer spend a lot of time together, and Jack meets an Other named Juliet. The complex relationships between the characters creates more tension than in previous seasons. If you care more about the characters and their relationships, this season might be for you. Fans of the science fiction aspects of Lost, who want the answers to their questions about the island and the DHARMA initiative, will have to wait until the second half of the season to get a taste of what they're looking for. My personal favorite episode is ""The Man From Tallahassee"", in which we learn about how Locke came to be in a wheelchair. The scenes between Michael Emerson (Ben) and Terry O'Quinn (Locke) are just fun to watch.Just as the previous two seasons of Lost, Season 3 is a seven-disc set with plenty of bonus material. There are the usual Lost Flashbacks, which are never-before-seen segments into a character's past. The Lost on Location featurettes show various aspects of production of different episodes. The best feature in Season 3 is ""Lost in a Day"", where cameras take us into a time span of 24 hours, where seven episodes are in different stages - some being planned and written, others being filmed or edited.In summary, Season 3 is perhaps the weakest season of Lost, but it's still quite good and it moves the series into a new realm by giving more insight into the history of the Others, the DHARMA Initiative, and the powers of the island.",4,The mysteries are being revealed... slowly,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,1676,"['Season', '3', 'Lost', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'still', 'moments', 'greatness', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'deals', 'main', 'castaways', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'Others', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'Jack', 'meets', 'Other', 'named', 'Juliet', 'complex', 'relationships', 'characters', 'more', 'tension', 'previous', 'seasons', 'care', 'more', 'characters', 'relationships', 'season', 'might', 'be', 'Fans', 'science', 'fiction', 'aspects', 'Lost', 'who', 'want', 'answers', 'questions', 'island', 'DHARMA', 'initiative', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'get', 'taste', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Man', 'Tallahassee', 'learn', 'how', 'Locke', 'came', 'be', 'wheelchair', 'scenes', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'Ben', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Locke', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'watch.Just', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'Season', '3', 'seven-disc', 'set', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'material', 'are', 'usual', 'Lost', 'Flashbacks', 'are', 'never-before-seen', 'segments', 'character', 'past', 'Lost', 'Location', 'featurettes', 'show', 'various', 'aspects', 'production', 'different', 'episodes', 'best', 'feature', 'Season', '3', 'Lost', 'Day', 'where', 'cameras', 'take', 'time', 'span', '24', 'hours', 'where', 'seven', 'episodes', 'are', 'different', 'stages', 'being', 'planned', 'written', 'others', 'being', 'filmed', 'edited.In', 'summary', 'Season', '3', 'perhaps', 'weakest', 'season', 'Lost', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'series', 'new', 'realm', 'giving', 'more', 'insight', 'history', 'Others', 'DHARMA', 'Initiative', 'powers', 'island']",Lost: Season 3

Now, i have been a Lost-acholic ever since i bought the first season on DVD and i belive that it is one of the most well crafted shows out there. Sure, it may bring up more questions then answers but then that will give us more answers and revelations.So you can pretty much divide this season into two halves. The first being the 'fall season', which was the first six episodes and then the 'spring season', being the next sixteen. I thought the Fall season was pretty...well, boring to say the least. Barely nothing happens and nothing is resolved (unless u count Jack's tattoe's, but i really didn't pay much attention to them anyway). However, things definently picked up during the Spring season. First smart move, getting rid of Nicky and Paolo, in a very nicely contructed episode that ended with a macarbe and sinister end. Second, getting Sawyer and Kate off that island. Finally, bringing a background to Juliette and some of the other 'Others'. And finally, that season finale, by far the best one yet. I mean honestly, who can say they saw THAT one coming?Now, the new season won't start until February. For the Lost fans, thats bad. But for the rest of you, its the perfect oppertunity to pick up the first three seasons of Lost so you can get all caught up before the season premire. and for the rest of you, just give it time.

1069061,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000P6YNSE,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Where season 2 was all about the hatch, this season was all about the others and learning some of their back story.  Because this is still Lost, we do not learn everything through the course of the season, but we do get an understanding of who they are, and how they ended up there.Season 3 picks up where the season 2 cliffhanger left off.  Kate, Jack and Sawyer were taken and held prisoner.  So the first half the the season is essentially telling three or four parallel stories.  Those of the people still on the beach.  Fleshing out the others' story and following Kate Sawyer and Jack.  Most, but not all, of the character development in this season revolves around who the &#34;main&#34; Others were, and how they came to be there.  Although we do learn some other things along the way like how Locke was paralyzed, a familial relation that is revealed only to the viewers along with a lot more of the Jin/Sun relationship.Like in past years the characters do not get through the season unscathed, and the season ends not only on a cliff hanger, but with the first flash forward of the series.  It definitely ends the season on a high note, with again some questions answered, but many others left open.  We also get cameos from a few characters that were killed off in prior seasons.As for the blu ray set for those who get the discs.  The series looks and sounds great again.  The season play mode is not as seamless is it was for the first two seasons, but it does work essentially the same way and you do not have to create a profile.  There are a lot of extras for those who like to go through them.  There is a good 2hrs plus worth of bonus material from behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, a gag reel and commentaries.Lost is definitely not a show that is for the impatient or people who cannot accept weird twists.  You have to be able to suspend your disbelief and realize that you will not learn everything at once.  I is probably an easier series to watch on disc than it was when it aired because you do not get all the time between episodes and you can follow all the plot points better.  If you like fantasy, action, drama, and/or mystery this is definitely a show worth checking out because it blends them all together very well.",5,The Others,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2259,"['Where', 'season', '2', 'was', 'hatch', 'season', 'was', 'others', 'learning', 'back', 'story', 'still', 'Lost', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'everything', 'course', 'season', 'do', 'get', 'understanding', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'there.Season', '3', 'picks', 'up', 'where', 'season', '2', 'cliffhanger', 'left', 'off', 'Kate', 'Jack', 'Sawyer', 'were', 'taken', 'held', 'prisoner', 'first', 'season', 'essentially', 'telling', 'three', 'four', 'parallel', 'stories', 'people', 'still', 'beach', 'Fleshing', 'out', 'others', 'story', 'following', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'Jack', 'Most', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'season', 'who', '34', 'main', '34', 'Others', 'were', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'there', 'do', 'learn', 'other', 'things', 'way', 'how', 'Locke', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'familial', 'relation', 'revealed', 'only', 'viewers', 'lot', 'more', 'Jin/Sun', 'relationship.Like', 'past', 'years', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'season', 'unscathed', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'first', 'flash', 'forward', 'series', 'definitely', 'season', 'high', 'note', 'again', 'questions', 'answered', 'many', 'others', 'left', 'open', 'also', 'get', 'cameos', 'few', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'prior', 'seasons.As', 'blu', 'ray', 'set', 'who', 'get', 'discs', 'series', 'great', 'again', 'season', 'play', 'mode', 'not', 'seamless', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'work', 'essentially', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'create', 'profile', 'are', 'lot', 'extras', 'who', 'like', 'go', 'good', '2hrs', 'worth', 'bonus', 'material', 'scenes', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'commentaries.Lost', 'definitely', 'not', 'show', 'impatient', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'weird', 'twists', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'realize', 'will', 'not', 'learn', 'everything', 'once', 'probably', 'easier', 'series', 'watch', 'disc', 'was', 'when', 'aired', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'time', 'episodes', 'can', 'follow', 'plot', 'points', 'better', 'like', 'fantasy', 'action', 'drama', 'and/or', 'mystery', 'definitely', 'show', 'checking', 'out', 'together', 'very', 'well']",Lost: Season 3

""Lost"" may frustrate and even infuriate its fans for episodes on end, but the show's makers always manage to keep viewers enthralled over the long haul, winding them in ever stronger, ever stickier webs of plot, character revelation, and ominous portent. (For the record, I avoid the show during its regular broadcast season and catch up with it in one gulp on DVD, thus avoiding a good part of the frustration.) Season 3 continues the high standards of the first two seasons, presenting us with further details about the Others, the fate of the Dharma Initative, several intriguing new characters and shocking developments among the old characters that, no matter how closely you follow the show, are guaranteed to knock you for a loop. If you want to know how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, discover how Ben maintains his nefarious hold over the Others, or see a couple of the longtime characters (I won't say which ones) in the very first flashforward of life after the island, Season 3 will provide that, and more. It's still a marvel how Abrams, Cuse, Lindelof & Co. can lead us down ever more bizarre plot pathways, creating an almost Elizabethan body count along the way, and still keep a sense of total continuity. My favorite episode of Season 3 came almost exactly in its middle: the self-contained tale of minor characters Nikki and Paulo, giving us their backstory and their highly ironic ultimate fate. Alfred Hitchcock would have approved, and possibly Geoffrey Chaucer as well!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[8, 13]","It's no secret that the third season of Lost got off to a slow and shaky start, and it's even less of a secret that the show rebounded in the last episodes of the season and once again displayed that early promise it first showed back in 2004 upon it's premiere.  As the season begins, Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) are imprisoned by Ben (Michael Emerson) and the Others, while Sayid (Naveen Andrews), along with Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) wait to see what happens.  In the meantime, the aftermath of the hatch explosion leaves Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) a changed man with deadly premonitions of the future for Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) embarks on a mission to rescue a wounded Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).  Eventually everyone is brought back together, as Jack prepares to lead an assault on the Others in an attempt to escape the island once and for all, which leads to the explosive season finale which changes everything about Lost from this point onward.  As we've come to expect, some questions are answered while plenty of new ones appear, but this season of Lost manages to mostly satisfy thanks to the fine ensemble cast and plenty of surprises, including demises of a fan favorite character, and a not so favorite one as well.  Other than the complaints of the deliverate pacing of the show, some favorites like Hurley (Jorge Garcia), Charlie, and Claire (Emilie de Ravin) aren't focused on as much as one would like, but their centric-based episodes are enjoyable nevertheless.  The rest of the cast, which also features Elizabeth Mitchell as a shady Other who may or may not hold the key to escape, and 300's Rodrigo ""Xerxes"" Santoro, are also standouts as well.  Despite it's flaws though, the season finale is brilliantly delivered and truly changes everything we know about the show and it's concept, and will have you salivating for more.

Weird (in a good way), Insightful and Intelligent - and with much better luck with scheduling and ratings.The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture, Good and Evil are, all, in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable.Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.The 3rd Season surpassed even the 1st one in plot twists and reversals. Lighter on background stories, it focused more on the Others and Ben's hold on them through the spectral and mysterious Jacob. It also featured one of the gutsier cliffhangers ever: a flash-forward that, had it not been pulled off so skillfully, it would have killed all interest in the show.True, as expected after the huge success of the show, some...dilution is detectable (the producers are probably worried of running out of ideas) - yet we should be counting our blessings.

You have to study this show, read other books that show up in the form of easter eggs and watch each episode at least 3 times to really get it. This show asks philosophical questions and uses elements from the bible, Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz and a thousand other influences to give us that rare show that will fuel imaginations for generations to come.That all being said we are only a little over half way through. With 3 more seasons (16 episodes each) to go, this season gave us many of the answers about the characters. It told us how Locke lost his ability to walk, who the real Sawyer was and how Benjamin Linus got to the island to name a few. We also had a glimpse of the mysterious Jacob but most intriguing of all is the idea that the bad guys are in fact the good guys, at least in comparison to this other enemy that has been looking for the island from the beginning.It's quite a show. I don't feel it dipped in quality at all, but things were certainly set up for some big pays off at the end of this season. There is no question that if you are a fan of this show you have to pick this DVD set up. You have to study each episode so that you get the big picture.So now that the writers have a definite timeline there is little question that each proceeding episode will be a step towards some answers from here on out.

1069075,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000P6YNSE,OverTheMoon,"[3, 3]","Lost is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' and yet remains totally unique in every conceivable way. Lost is something to look forward to. It really has become a part of our lives.In many ways the best way to enjoy Lost is to avoid learning anything about it and just watch it with others who know nothing about it and guess what is going on. For this reason just buy it and prepare to watch a whole season in the span of a few days and then sulk in disappointed over how you have to wait another year to watch the next season, skipping TV, because you know watching a season with every episode back to back is the best way to experience the best that television has to offer.The logistics are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island the audience comes to realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them.Why are `the others' on the island? Who will Kate fall for? Who is Ben really? How did `the others' get there? What is the `Dharma initiative'? Are there psychics? What strange connection does Locke have with the island? Are there ghosts? Is this all an experiment? These are the kind of questions that can come up in a single episode of Lost... however the catch is that you have to wait quite awhile for anything to get answered and the good news is that Lost Season 3, does answer a lot of questions... but opens up a whole lot more.Season 1 was about the island. Season 2 is about the hatch. Season 3 is about `the others'.Season 3 is essentially finished with the hatch, but there are a lot more hatches with different things going on. The island expands with more interesting places to visit. It is becoming a bit of a treasure hunt.In the first season we sat through quite a number of background stories for the series character build-ups, that are quite well driven, although extremely odd at times. These character build-ups are still occurring, so they are certainly a mainstream part of the show, and `the others' get their own back stories now too.The producers are still working on the death clock element and they do kill off major characters. Main characters will die in Season 3. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? Will Dr. Jack side with `the others'? Will Sawyer kill again? Is Charlie going to die? Michael doesn't show up for Season 3, but for a split scene we do see Walt and even Boon.The seven degrees of separation are now quickly becoming one degree. We are learning that the characters have more in common then we previously could have imagined. There is a huge twist in a back story in the last episode that will leave your jaw on the stick popcorn floor. The writers of this show are simply layering on the drama to near melting point.The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer.",5,The best edge of your seat box office appeal is actually on TV,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,3365,"['Lost', 'part', 'ER', 'part', 'Star', 'Trek', 'part', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'part', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'whole', 'big', 'bit', 'Survivor', 'yet', 'totally', 'unique', 'conceivable', 'way', 'Lost', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'really', 'become', 'part', 'lives.In', 'many', 'ways', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'Lost', 'avoid', 'learning', 'anything', 'just', 'watch', 'others', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'reason', 'just', 'buy', 'prepare', 'watch', 'whole', 'season', 'span', 'few', 'days', 'then', 'sulk', 'disappointed', 'how', 'have', 'wait', 'year', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'skipping', 'TV', 'know', 'watching', 'season', 'episode', 'back', 'back', 'best', 'way', 'experience', 'best', 'television', 'offer.The', 'logistics', 'are', 'simple', 'plane', 'travelling', 'Sydney', 'LA', 'veered', '1000km', 'course', 'smashed', 'island', 'strewing', 'passengers', 'everywhere', 'who', 'soon', 'learn', 'co-pilot', 'rescuers', 'are', 'looking', 'wrong', 'place', 'When', 'co-pilot', 'hurled', 'air', 'eaten', 'alive', 'invisible', 'beast', 'who', 'island', 'audience', 'realize', 'island', 'ordinary', 'island', 'so', 'do', 'survivors', 'who', 'set', 'establishing', 'facing', 'various', 'challenges', 'befall', 'them.Why', 'are', 'others', 'island', 'Who', 'will', 'Kate', 'fall', 'Who', 'Ben', 'really', 'How', 'did', 'others', 'get', 'there', 'What', 'Dharma', 'initiative', 'Are', 'psychics', 'What', 'strange', 'connection', 'Locke', 'have', 'island', 'Are', 'there', 'ghosts', 'experiment', 'are', 'kind', 'questions', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'single', 'episode', 'Lost', 'however', 'catch', 'have', 'wait', 'quite', 'awhile', 'anything', 'get', 'answered', 'good', 'news', 'Lost', 'Season', '3', 'answer', 'lot', 'questions', 'up', 'whole', 'lot', 'more.Season', '1', 'was', 'island', 'Season', '2', 'hatch', 'Season', '3', ""others'.Season"", '3', 'essentially', 'finished', 'hatch', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'hatches', 'different', 'things', 'going', 'island', 'more', 'interesting', 'places', 'visit', 'becoming', 'bit', 'treasure', 'first', 'season', 'sat', 'quite', 'number', 'background', 'stories', 'series', 'character', 'build-ups', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'driven', 'extremely', 'odd', 'times', 'character', 'build-ups', 'are', 'still', 'occurring', 'are', 'certainly', 'mainstream', 'part', 'show', 'others', 'get', 'own', 'back', 'stories', 'now', 'too.The', 'producers', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'death', 'clock', 'element', 'do', 'kill', 'off', 'major', 'characters', 'Main', 'characters', 'will', 'die', 'Season', '3.', 'Who', 'do', 'side', 'why', 'Who', 'do', 'hope', 'who', 'do', 'secretly', 'hope', ""n't"", 'Will', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'side', 'others', 'Will', 'Sawyer', 'kill', 'again', 'Charlie', 'going', 'die', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'split', 'scene', 'do', 'see', 'Walt', 'even', 'Boon.The', 'seven', 'degrees', 'separation', 'are', 'now', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'degree', 'are', 'learning', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'then', 'previously', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'huge', 'twist', 'back', 'story', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'stick', 'popcorn', 'floor', 'writers', 'show', 'are', 'simply', 'layering', 'drama', 'melting', 'point.The', 'ethnic', 'variations', 'actors', 'Lost', 'worldwide', 'appeal', 'deservingly', 'so', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'offer']",Lost: Season 3

1069079,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B000P6YNSE,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[0, 0]","The common consensus with fans seems to be that the third season ofLostis the weakest.  I have to, respectfully, disagree.The genius writers and assorted crew behind ""Lost"" kept it fresh in thesecond seasonby focusing most of the action around the mysterious hatch.  In the case of this season (the third), the main plot focuses on the conflict between the Oceanic survivors and the Others.  Finally, after two entire seasons shrouded in mystery, some of the big questions start to get answers.+ We learn how Ben came to be the leader of the Others+ We learn what happened to the Dharma Initiative+ We get a 'sort of' origin story for the Others+ We learn how Locke ended up in a wheelchair.But that's not it.  This season has a tighter narrative than any of those previous.  While the flashbacks sometimes felt a bit contrived (especially the ""how Jack got his tattoo"" story), the main plots of each of these episodes tied very nicely in to each other, creating a very focused story-arc for this season.  Jack, Sawyer, Kate, Charlie, and Desmond get some great character development, while characters that seemed to be static (such as Hurley) start to play larger parts.  As with any show, there were story lines that I wasn't sure about (such as Locke becoming increasingly morally ambiguous), but the fact that I was constantly shocked and enthralled by this show is just a testament to how well-done it is.Though the story is so continuous in ""Lost"" (particularly this season), it's hard to pick out the episodes that really stand out, but there are a few I thought really solidified this series as one of the best I've ever seen.  These are those episodes.5. The Cost of Living: Tugs on your heartstrings, and opens up new questions.4. Flashes Before Your Eyes: I was confused at the decision to make Desmond a permanent character, but this episode made him one of my favorites.  Tragic, revealing, and the essence of ""Lost.""3. Tricia Tanaka Is Dead: Nearly perfect. This episode solidifies Hurley as a great character, and shows the characters having fun, which is great to see in the middle of so much drama.2. Greatest Hits: As a penultimate episode, it is a perfect example of how to build up tension for an explosive finale.  Also, it has the greatest usage of flashbacks (recounting the best moments of Charlie's life) in the series, until...1. Through the Looking Glass: This two-part finale is a roller coaster ride that will keep you tense up (with tears in your eyes, because not everyone makes it out alive) until the shocking end.This show is brilliant.  Simple as that.  At this point, I trust the ""Lost"" team with any path they want to take us down, because this season and the two previous ones are proof that the yarn they spin is golden.10/10 Classic.",5,Secrets Revealed,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,2773,"['common', 'consensus', 'fans', 'be', 'third', 'season', 'weakest', 'have', 'respectfully', 'disagree.The', 'genius', 'writers', 'assorted', 'crew', 'Lost', 'kept', 'fresh', 'thesecond', 'seasonby', 'focusing', 'most', 'action', 'mysterious', 'hatch', 'case', 'season', 'third', 'main', 'plot', 'focuses', 'conflict', 'Oceanic', 'survivors', 'Others', 'Finally', 'two', 'entire', 'seasons', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'big', 'questions', 'start', 'get', 'learn', 'how', 'Ben', 'came', 'be', 'leader', 'Others+', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'Dharma', 'Initiative+', 'get', ""'sort"", 'origin', 'story', 'Others+', 'learn', 'how', 'Locke', 'ended', 'up', 'wheelchair.But', 'not', 'season', 'tighter', 'narrative', 'previous', 'flashbacks', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'bit', 'contrived', 'especially', 'how', 'Jack', 'got', 'tattoo', 'story', 'main', 'plots', 'episodes', 'tied', 'very', 'nicely', 'other', 'creating', 'very', 'focused', 'story-arc', 'season', 'Jack', 'Sawyer', 'Kate', 'Charlie', 'Desmond', 'get', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'static', 'such', 'Hurley', 'start', 'play', 'larger', 'parts', 'show', 'were', 'story', 'lines', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'such', 'Locke', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'fact', 'was', 'constantly', 'shocked', 'enthralled', 'show', 'just', 'testament', 'how', 'well-done', 'story', 'so', 'continuous', 'Lost', 'particularly', 'season', 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'episodes', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'few', 'thought', 'really', 'solidified', 'series', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'episodes.5', 'Cost', 'Living', 'Tugs', 'heartstrings', 'up', 'new', 'questions.4', 'Flashes', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'was', 'confused', 'decision', 'make', 'Desmond', 'permanent', 'character', 'episode', 'made', 'one', 'favorites', 'Tragic', 'revealing', 'essence', 'Lost.', '3', 'Tricia', 'Tanaka', 'Dead', 'Nearly', 'perfect', 'episode', 'Hurley', 'great', 'character', 'characters', 'having', 'fun', 'great', 'see', 'middle', 'so', 'much', 'drama.2', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'explosive', 'finale', 'Also', 'greatest', 'usage', 'flashbacks', 'recounting', 'best', 'moments', 'Charlie', 'life', 'series', '1', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'two-part', 'finale', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'will', 'keep', 'tense', 'up', 'tears', 'eyes', 'not', 'everyone', 'out', 'alive', 'shocking', 'end.This', 'show', 'brilliant', 'Simple', 'point', 'trust', 'Lost', 'team', 'path', 'want', 'take', 'down', 'season', 'two', 'previous', 'ones', 'are', 'proof', 'yarn', 'spin', 'golden.10/10', 'Classic']",Lost: Season 3

Seeing Lost on blu-ray takes the show to a whole new level. With 6 times the resolution of  DVD, everything just seems to pop out at you in this amazing 6 disc set. From the grass and trees on the island to the blue sky and the facial expressions (including seeing the actors pores), every detail just pops out like nothing you have seen before in a TV show.

1069093,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000P6YNSE,Robert Moore,"[308, 380]","Warning!  Major spoiler alert!I believe that Season Three of LOST is one of those seasons of a show that will have a significant impact on the dynamics of television quite apart from the merits or demerits of the season itself.  This is mainly due to various tensions the networks have had in broadcasting serial dramas.  Season Two of LOST provoked vast viewer anger over the seemingly endless repeats.  All season long they would give us four or five new episodes, only to do three or four repeats.  No one knew sometimes if they would be tuning into a repeat or a new episode.  To counter this, ABC made the decision to broadcast six episodes in the fall to be followed by sixteen episodes shown without interruption beginning in January.  Unfortunately, the six episodes they showed in the fall were almost universally perceived as the weakest group of episodes in the show's run.  The results of all this I think will be threefold:1.  In the future, I think the trend with popular serial dramas will be to broadcast shows in uninterrupted hunks.  We had already seen this happening with 24.  I think after the Season Three debacle with LOST, which saw the show lose a huge number of viewers during its break, this will become far more commonplace.2.  The general perception of the first six episodes of the season was that they dawdled too much, provided too little plot development, and simply didn't advance the narrative sufficiently.  Shows tend to learn from the mistakes and failures of other series.  Damon Lindelhof of LOST has stated that the writers on the show have attempted to avoid the piling up of mysteries that occurred on TWIN PEAKS and the lack of focus on character rather than plot on THE X-FILES and to emulate the focus on character within the overall narrative that was seen in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I believe in the future that writers on other serial narratives will strive to make sure that the mysteries on a show are being revealed at a good pace.  (Just as I think future writers will try to emulate the pace at which this has been done on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.)3.  There was also a widespread perception that in much of Season Two of LOST and the first six episodes of Season Three, the overall narrative was simply being padded out to ensure a long run for the show.  From the beginning looked like a show that needed fewer rather than more seasons to be truly good, but it appeared that with the ratings monster it was in the first two seasons that the powers that be were hoping they could stretch it out to seven or eight seasons instead of five or six.  Luckily, the huge backlash against the show following the first six episodes--a backlash that occurred both among everyday fans and among TV critics--seems to have created a reassessment and in the spring it was announced that LOST would be back for three more sixteen-episode seasons.  I was delighted with how positively this announcement was greeted by fans and critics alike.  I think the result has been for the networks to recognize that certain kinds of series have only a limited potential in terms of the number of episodes that can be produced, that there are certain series that you can really only produce if you anticipate their going four or five or at most six seasons.  The other series this is happening with is BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which like LOST is more or less telling a single story.  Both of these are outstanding series that will benefit from a smaller number of series (the debate among the producers of BSG at the moment is whether they need to end the series at the end of Season Four or whether they will need a Season Five).  As a negative example there is PRISON BREAK, which currently is threatening to fall apart for lack of any real plan.The great news about Season Three is that after the long break the show came back as good as ever.  If we were rating this as one would rate an ice skater, we'd have to give it a lower rating based on some slips and falls early in its routine.  But it rebounded wonderfully and the frustration that most viewers experienced in the fall rarely if ever returned in the spring.  Furthermore, they started giving us concrete answers to a host of questions that had been bothering us for ages.  We found out all about the others (though not where they originally came from), about the lay out of the island, about the facilities on the island, and a few of -- though by no means all of -- the island's secrets.  At the end of the season there were still things we'd like to know about -- Just who is Jacob?  What's up with the black smoke?  What makes the island so special? What was the genesis of the Dharma Initiative -- but there is no doubt that we knew vastly more than we knew before.  There were also many new characters.  Ben, whom we knew in Season Two as Henry, was back and became one of the most fascinating characters on the show.  And we were introduced to the enigmatic Juliet, whose sad and wistful smile was as impossible to comprehend as the Mona Lisa's.  We learned that following the decimation of the hatch at the end of Season Two Desmond experienced visions of the future and seemed doomed to reenacting events.  The deep attraction between Jack and Kate was made more explicit even though she ends up furthering things with Sawyer.  And as many fans suspected as early as Season One, Locke's father turned out to be the real Sawyer.  Our Sawyer coming face-to-face with the real Sawyer was not only one of the highlights of the season but of the entire series.I want to say something about the finale, but without giving away the details of how the last five minutes of the season changes absolutely everything we know about the series.  The changes are, interestingly, not so much in new revelations as in ways that are open for the show to proceed narratively in the future.  For the past three seasons the narrative has proceeded in the present with flashbacks to the past of various characters.  That is no longer possible.  In the future the narrative will of necessity either proceed on the island with flash forwards or will take place in the future with flashbacks to events following the end of Season Three.  (Sorry to be vague here, but I really think that one should watch Season Three without knowing what happens at the end of the season to change everything so completely.)  I honestly have no idea what way they will proceed.  If I had to bet, I would say that the show will continue to use flashbacks, but that the main narrative will proceed in the present.  The first three seasons took place pretty much exclusively in the calendar year 2004.  I believe Season Four could well take place in 2008 with flashbacks to the previous four years.  Regardless, the surprising ending changed everything.There is one beef I want to make with the show.  As much as I love this series, it has to handle the death of characters worse than just about any I have seen.  The first series to kill off a substantial number of central and beloved characters was BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  There had been other deaths on television series, to be sure.  The death of Deep Throat at the end of the first season of THE X-FILES was close to unprecedented at the time.  Previously characters largely died because they wanted to leave a show, like the death of Edith on ALL IN THE FAMILY or Denise Crosby's departure from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.  But BUFFY created the habit of killing off key characters.  I'm not sure I've ever been so completely shocked at the death of any character on TV as I was when Angel killed Jenny Calendar in Season Two of BUFFY.  It shattered the hallowed tradition on TV that you simply don't kill off characters you like.  It ushered in a new era on TV to great effect.  Suddenly, a new sense of danger was introduced to TV.  Before you always knew that all the characters would survive any catastrophe, no matter how dire, simply because that was the nature of TV.  But after BUFFY and the way that other series so quickly picked up on its willingness to kill characters, a new sense of precariousness extended to almost every show on TV.  And TV was certainly the better for it.  One thing that made the deaths on BUFFY so compelling was that each one carried such a great price and had such enormous consequences.  All the deaths were exceedingly well done.  But this has not been the case on LOST.  Perhaps the deaths will be made less meaningless by developments in the final three seasons, though I somehow doubt it.  Characters were killed off in almost random fashion.  At least there was no real sense about why they were killed off.  It seems like someone said, ""Well, we need to kill someone off.""  And some of the deaths seemed to be caused by off screen activities.  Michelle Rodgriguez's death in Season Two was thought by many to be in response to a violation of probation that might have required some jail time and impinged on the shooting schedule (she claims she only signed up for one season).  In Season Three Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's great character Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return (some anonymous cast members reported that he was dictatorial to the extent of telling other actors what they should do or how to speak their lines--all reports are that no one was sad to see him leave the set).  But even so his death felt like he had been ripped from the show prematurely.  And a major death in the season finale felt equally unnecessary.  I believe that this will also influence future shows.  I think ""the body count"" is a permanent fixture in any series with an adventure element, but I think that future shows will strive not to make the death of characters as superfluous as they have been in LOST.The final three seasons will all begin in the winter and be broadcast for sixteen straight weeks with no interruptions.  I love this not merely because it means no dead times between episodes but because it puts definite limits on how much time they have left to finish the story.  I think most fans of the show feel a lot better about how things are going now than they did last fall.  Then the series seemed moribund and seemed almost to be drifting.  Now it feels like it is heading somewhere definite.  And it ended the season by doing something that all the really great shows do:  it took a gigantic risk that changes everything.  I look forward with excitement to what happens next.",5,"After a shaky beginning, Season Three rebounds marvelously for a very strong finish",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,10524,"['Warning', 'Major',

1069094,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000P6YNSE,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","Lost Season Three is weird, but then again the whole series is weird by design, so what's not to like?  With Jack, Sawyer, and Kate (the Lost love-triangle) all in cages held by the Others at the beginning of the season, the series makes a bit of a tedious beginning.  But as usual, things pick up and Season Three does not disappoint.One of the weird things about Lost (there are many) is that there are 40+ survivors, but we really only get to know a handful.  Once in a while some of the outliers show up in some scene or other, and when one lovely woman outlier says something disagreeable to Sawyer, he pretty much speaks for us all with the line: ""who the hell are you?""  My thoughts exactly, and we never do find out.  Hilarious.One thing about this series: it is not afraid to kill off major characters.  Season Three is noteworthy in this regards.  No spoilers here.I liked Season Three just fine.  The Dharma Initiative continues to creep everyone out, the smoke monster is as mysterious as ever.  Elizabeth Mitchell makes her debut in this season as Juliet Burke, and she is as lovely as ever.  Mitchell is a charismatic actress, beautiful, well-spoken, with a presence that causes her to dominate every scene she is in.  Since she is a doctor, will she interrupt Jack's interest in Kate?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Again, no spoilers here.Another great season.  Highly recommended.

1069096,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000P6YNSE,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[6, 7]","Another masterful season of ""Lost"" has come to a crashing, and enigmatic end.  For fans (like me) drawn to the show's thrills and riddles, Season 3 didn't disappoint.  Like Season 2, you can't just get into the show, but ""Lost"" more than rewards those who can start from the beginning.ARE YOU LOST:  ""Lost"" follows the trauma-filled lives and back-stories of the survivors of Oceanic Ft. 815, which crashed on a mysterious island enroute from Sydney to LA.  As time passed, and hopes for an immediate rescue dimmed, the survivors realized that they would have to come to terms with their new home, even as (we see in flashbacks) none have proved capable of coming to terms with their flawed lives.  We met jack Shepard, a doctor obsessed with fixing whatever's broken, except for his own family.  We also met Sawyer, the conman and heroic anti-hero.  Kate is the woman between the two of them, a criminal on the run for murder.  Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is a man with a long and complicated past - one that crippled him physically as well as emotionally, until he came to the Island, and found himself mysteriously bonded to it.Then there are The Others.  Hinted at until the end of the 1st season, we find by the end of Season 2 that the others inhabit an organized commune on the island.  Their purpose and the bizarre strains of their society are slowly pealed away like an onion.  At the climax, the Others blackmailed Michael into helping them kidnap Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley.  (Hurley was released with orders to warn the rest of the survivors to keep away from their half of the island.)  Who are the others, and what is their connection to the shadowy ""Dharma Initiative""?  And what about ""Fake Henry Gale""?  Revealing himself as Ben Linus doesn't quite begin to explain his knotty soul - Ben proves to be as trustworthy, a politician of sorts adept at using fear and hatred to manipulate others.  (For politically minded viewers, the opening scene of Season 3 will raise disturbing parallels with 9/11, and its principal players.)  But in the end, the Others are perfectly drawn because, like the Island, they have a perfectly maintained air of mystery.In Season 3, Jack must confront the others, find out why he was singled out, and maneuver between them to get Sawyer and Kate to safety.  New characters get the Lost treatment, with flashback episodes for Ben, Desmond (the crazy guy found by Locke in The Hatch) and Juliet, a doctor among the others used by Ben to manipulate Jack.  We see Locke struggle through a crisis of faith over the island, while Hurley attempts to defeat ""the numbers curse"" (another great Hurley episode).  Returned to the good graces of Claire, Charlie learns that he is marked for a grim fate.  These and many other character plot twists abound in Season 3, as ""Lost"" shows that it's lost none of its momentum.  The inertia continues right up to the end of the season finale, which has all the thrills and mystery of the rest of the season and something that the other shows don't - a flash-forward.",4,Begins with a blast and ends with a whimper...that you'll never forget,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,3041,"['masterful', 'season', 'Lost', 'come', 'crashing', 'enigmatic', 'end', 'fans', 'drawn', 'show', 'thrills', 'riddles', 'Season', '3', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Season', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'show', 'Lost', 'more', 'rewards', 'who', 'can', 'start', 'beginning.ARE', 'LOST', 'Lost', 'trauma-filled', 'lives', 'back-stories', 'survivors', 'Oceanic', 'Ft.', '815', 'crashed', 'mysterious', 'island', 'enroute', 'Sydney', 'LA', 'time', 'passed', 'immediate', 'rescue', 'dimmed', 'survivors', 'realized', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'home', 'even', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'none', 'have', 'proved', 'capable', 'coming', 'terms', 'flawed', 'lives', 'met', 'jack', 'Shepard', 'doctor', 'obsessed', 'fixing', 'broken', 'own', 'family', 'also', 'met', 'Sawyer', 'conman', 'heroic', 'anti-hero', 'Kate', 'woman', 'two', 'criminal', 'run', 'murder', 'Locke', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'man', 'long', 'complicated', 'one', 'crippled', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'came', 'Island', 'found', 'mysteriously', 'bonded', 'it.Then', 'are', 'Others', 'Hinted', 'end', '1st', 'season', 'find', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'others', 'inhabit', 'organized', 'commune', 'island', 'purpose', 'bizarre', 'strains', 'society', 'are', 'slowly', 'pealed', 'away', 'onion', 'climax', 'Others', 'blackmailed', 'Michael', 'helping', 'kidnap', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'Hurley', 'Hurley', 'was', 'released', 'orders', 'warn', 'rest', 'survivors', 'keep', 'away', 'half', 'island', 'are', 'others', 'what', 'connection', 'shadowy', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', 'what', 'Fake', 'Henry', 'Gale', 'Revealing', 'Ben', 'Linus', ""n't"", 'quite', 'begin', 'explain', 'knotty', 'soul', 'Ben', 'be', 'trustworthy', 'politician', 'sorts', 'adept', 'using', 'fear', 'hatred', 'manipulate', 'others', 'politically', 'minded', 'viewers', 'opening', 'scene', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'raise', 'disturbing', 'parallels', '9/11', 'principal', 'players', 'end', 'Others', 'are', 'perfectly', 'drawn', 'because', 'Island', 'have', 'perfectly', 'maintained', 'air', 'mystery.In', 'Season', '3', 'Jack', 'must', 'confront', 'others', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'singled', 'out', 'maneuver', 'get', 'Sawyer', 'Kate', 'safety', 'New', 'characters', 'get', 'Lost', 'treatment', 'flashback', 'episodes', 'Ben', 'Desmond', 'crazy', 'guy', 'found', 'Locke', 'Hatch', 'Juliet', 'doctor', 'others', 'used', 'Ben', 'manipulate', 'Jack', 'see', 'Locke', 'struggle', 'crisis', 'faith', 'island', 'Hurley', 'attempts', 'defeat', 'numbers', 'curse', 'great', 'Hurley', 'episode', 'Returned', 'good', 'graces', 'Claire', 'Charlie', 'marked', 'grim', 'fate', 'many', 'other', 'character', 'plot', 'twists', 'abound', 'Season', '3', 'Lost', 'lost', 'none', 'momentum', 'inertia', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'finale', 'thrills', 'mystery', 'rest', 'season', 'something', 'other', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'flash-forward']",Lost: Season 3

1069101,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B000P6YNSE,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[0, 0]","I love this series. And what a great plot! A passenger jet crashes on an island in the middle of the Pacific. There are survivors. They must all learn to live together to survive. They are not alone on the island. Some mysterious forces loom all around them. Some miracles happen: a paralyzed person suddenly walks (John Locke). Desmond gains the ability to see the future. Rose had cancer and now is in remission. Jin was sterile and now is not. The sperm count of the men on the island is way above normal. There are others; other humans are on the island. Some have crashed on the island; some have come on their own free will. What is the significance of the numbers? What is going on? What is going on?Indeed, what is going on? We are told towards the end of this season that the outside world has stopped searching for them, presuming them all dead. In fact, their airplane was found off the coast of Indonesia undersea. So are they dead? Are they spirits? Does the world know of the existence of the island? Who are the others?Season 3 finally tells us who the Others are, but there are still many unanswered questions.The following is a spoiler so stop reading if you have not seen the show yet: Season 3 ends with them being rescued, but with Jack wanting to return to the island. He flies every week across the Pacific hoping his jet will crash, and return him to the island. Why? We'll have to wait for Season 4. The writers actually took a big risk with such an ending. Season four will either live up to our expectations, or will not. Apparently, it was announced that there are three more Seasons, so the show will end with Season six.I truly liked the character of Juliet, and I think her and Jack make a perfect match. I just hope the writers don't kill her off like they do with all new characters they introduce. For example, the survivors of the tail section were all killed-off except one. Nikki and Paulo were also killed-off. In fact, having them buried alive was quite eerie.Why do the writers kill-off characters? Is it to make the story more realistic and captivating? This is not necessary the case. In this Season Mr. Eko was killed reportedly because he was hated by all his fellow cast members and he hated them all in return. Nikki and Paulo were killed-off because the fans of Lost hated them. The human element does change the storyline!This is a captivating Season, and I have been a fan since Season 1. Every time questions are answered new ones appear. The acting is superb, and the characters very believable. This is a first rate show, and you can't get any better. There is not one episode I did not enjoy. You never feel like the writers just lost grip of the storyline and threw in an episode as filler. You will find yourself won over by the cast and the plot.On a funny note, one reviewer writes, ""Why is Hurley still fat?

The hi-def, widescreen jungle, mountain and ocean scenes are incredible in Blu-Ray.The only drawback is that like many Blu-Ray DVDs, it is painfully slow to start up. And to make matters worse, LOST is one of those poorly-designed DVDs which will not start up at the same spot after it shuts down.Say that you put it on Pause and go to answer the phone. After a couple of minutes, the DVD player shuts down and you have to go through the painfully slow start-up again and scroll around to find where you paused. There is no excuse for producing a DVD this way, as far as I know. Other DVDs will restart from where they were stopped/paused, and some even have their own system for marking where they were stopped.The solution I use is to Pause, but then start it in slow-motion at 1/8 speed. This keeps it from cutting off, then when I get back, I can easily rewind to where I was.I hope LOST Season 4 comes out in B-R, but that it fixes this problem.",4,"Great show, beautiful in Blu-Ray, DVD works poorly.",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1007,"['LOST', 'possibly', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'times', 'hi-def', 'widescreen', 'jungle', 'mountain', 'ocean', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredible', 'Blu-Ray.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'many', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVDs', 'painfully', 'slow', 'start', 'up', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'LOST', 'one', 'poorly-designed', 'DVDs', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'up', 'same', 'spot', 'down.Say', 'put', 'Pause', 'go', 'answer', 'phone', 'couple', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'player', 'down', 'have', 'go', 'painfully', 'slow', 'start-up', 'again', 'scroll', 'around', 'find', 'where', 'paused', 'excuse', 'producing', 'DVD', 'way', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'Other', 'DVDs', 'will', 'restart', 'where', 'were', 'stopped/paused', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'system', 'marking', 'where', 'were', 'stopped.The', 'solution', 'use', 'Pause', 'then', 'start', 'slow-motion', '1/8', 'speed', 'cutting', 'off', 'then', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'can', 'easily', 'rewind', 'where', 'was.I', 'hope', 'LOST', 'Season', '4', 'out', 'B-R', 'problem']",Lost: Season 3

1069106,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B000P6YNSE,Steven Herring,"[2, 2]","This is my favorite season of LOST. It never seems to get boring it's constantly moving and changing. First they're captured then they're freed with a twist involved. The first six episodes are a mini season ending with a cliffhanger that left you stew for three months breathless. This season had a lot of great twists and turns with the Hatch, Nikki and Paulo, Charlie finding his fate, and Desmond teleporting through time. Then the finale hit and by the way the finale is my favorite episode of the series. It left you breathless and keep you wondering and obsessing over the long hiatus just what that last scene meant and what it would lead to. In a way the series had no where to go but down.The series in my mind has gone down after this season. The fourth season was still pretty good, but the fifth season was a mistake. They did however rectify it in the season 5 finale and it looks like season 6 the final season may rival this season for the best of the series. Anyway the third season is a must watch as you learn more about the others, the island, the man behind the curtain, and most importantly you delve deeper and with finer focus the lives and pasts of the survivors. This season like the previous two had a much different feel. It introduced so much information that is still prevalent in the final season. This season is the greatest 23 hours of television you will ever watch. The Blu Ray is crisp and clear and brings you closer to the island then you ever thought possible. If you're on the fence on whether you should buy this on Blu Ray or DVD do yourself a favor and pay the extra money the video quality and extra special features are well worth it.

Those are impatient people who don't have any regard for somthing called Story Line and suspense. Sure, I want to know the answers as well, and quickly. But I understand what the writers of Lost are trying to achieve. They want people to feel clueless and mystified by the show for as long as possible. They give clues throughout but continue to tease. Oh well. I will take that because this show is genius and so entertaining. All the actors do such a fantastic job that its so hard to choose a favorite. Though I do have mine of course. And also, every show in the history of shows has had episodes which may not have been up to par with other better ones, but that is no reason to bash a show as a whole. I had a couple episodes which I didn't enjoy myself. But that is a minor complaint. As a whole, and for 3 whole seasons, I have been addicted to Lost, and no one can convince me otherwise. No show is perfect, but for me, this show is close. And the season finale has got to be one of the best ever in the history of TV.",5,The Best Show out there,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,1073,"['do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'impatient', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'regard', 'somthing', 'called', 'Story', 'Line', 'suspense', 'Sure', 'want', 'know', 'answers', 'as', 'well', 'quickly', 'understand', 'what', 'writers', 'Lost', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'want', 'people', 'feel', 'clueless', 'mystified', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'give', 'clues', 'continue', 'tease', 'Oh', 'well', 'will', 'take', 'show', 'genius', 'so', 'entertaining', 'actors', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'so', 'hard', 'choose', 'favorite', 'do', 'have', 'mine', 'course', 'also', 'show', 'history', 'shows', 'had', 'episodes', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'better', 'ones', 'reason', 'bash', 'show', 'whole', 'had', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'minor', 'complaint', 'whole', '3', 'whole', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'addicted', 'Lost', 'one', 'can', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'show', 'perfect', 'show', 'close', 'season', 'finale', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'history', 'TV']",Lost: Season 3
1069120,AP3B615GM191G,B000P6YNSE,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","While the first season of LOST introduced viewers to the important survivors of Oceanic 815, and the second season dealt with what was inside the hatch, the third season dealt primarily with the Others, a mysterious group of people that were on the island long before Oceanic 815 ever crashed on the beach.This season begins right where the second season left off, with Jack, Kate, and Sawyer as captives of the Others.  As the season progresses, we learn more about why the Others only take specific prisoners, what their relationship is to the DHARMA initiative, and how they (most importantly Ben) came to be on the island in the first place.  I could go on and on about the dramatic plot twists and turns, but I don't want to ruin anything for you!Besides the main mysterious plotlines, however, the emotional drama of the show is also ratcheted up a notch.  Again, I don't want to ruin any big moments with a slip of the tongue here, but in this season the flashbacks of the ""Losties"" converge more than ever, as it becomes more and more apparent that the crash of Oceanic 815 was not a random event.  More specifically, this season really highlights the Jack/Kate relationship, with some of the most emotional ""Jate"" moments of the entire show so far.  The drama is heightened when Jack finds a new love interest among the Others, while Kate and Sawyer become closer than ever before.Yet, the entire breadth of the season pales in comparison to the shocking season finale, in which the entire structure of the show is changed.  If anyone could fault this season for anything, it would be that it seemed like the writers/producers were milking the plotlines as they did not know how long the show would go (a common problem among popular TV shows).  However, once the writers/producers finalized a contract with ABC to run for six seasons total, they become much more free to go all-out with their storytelling as the season went on, and it shows.To conclude, the third season of LOST is just as action-packed, thought-provoking, and emotionally relevant as the first two seasons.  The origin of the Others is better explained, the flashbacks are just as compelling as ever (specifically those involving Jack and Kate), and the season finale will absolutely blow you away.  You might as well pre-order season four now, as you will be counting down the days until its release.",5,All About The Others,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,2380,"['first', 'season', 'LOST', 'introduced', 'viewers', 'important', 'survivors', 'Oceanic', '815', 'second', 'season', 'dealt', 'what', 'was', 'hatch', 'third', 'season', 'dealt', 'primarily', 'Others', 'mysterious', 'group', 'people', 'were', 'island', 'long', 'before', 'Oceanic', '815', 'ever', 'crashed', 'beach.This', 'season', 'right', 'where', 'second', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'captives', 'Others', 'season', 'learn', 'more', 'why', 'Others', 'only', 'take', 'specific', 'prisoners', 'what', 'relationship', 'DHARMA', 'initiative', 'how', 'most', 'importantly', 'Ben', 'came', 'be', 'island', 'first', 'place', 'could', 'go', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'main', 'mysterious', 'plotlines', 'however', 'emotional', 'drama', 'show', 'also', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'notch', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'big', 'moments', 'slip', 'tongue', 'here', 'season', 'flashbacks', 'Losties', 'converge', 'more', 'ever', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'crash', 'Oceanic', '815', 'was', 'not', 'random', 'event', 'More', 'specifically', 'season', 'really', 'Jack/Kate', 'relationship', 'most', 'emotional', 'Jate', 'moments', 'entire', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'drama', 'heightened', 'when', 'Jack', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Others', 'Kate', 'Sawyer', 'become', 'closer', 'ever', 'before.Yet', 'entire', 'breadth', 'season', 'pales', 'comparison', 'shocking', 'season', 'finale', 'entire', 'structure', 'show', 'changed', 'anyone', 'could', 'fault', 'season', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'seemed', 'writers/producers', 'were', 'milking', 'plotlines', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'long', 'show', 'would', 'go', 'common', 'problem', 'popular', 'TV', 'shows', 'However', 'once', 'writers/producers', 'finalized', 'contract', 'ABC', 'run', 'six', 'seasons', 'total', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'free', 'go', 'all-out', 'storytelling', 'season', 'went', 'shows.To', 'conclude', 'third', 'season', 'LOST', 'just', 'action-packed', 'thought-provoking', 'emotionally', 'relevant', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'origin', 'Others', 'better', 'explained', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'compelling', 'ever', 'specifically', 'involving', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'season', 'finale', 'will', 'absolutely', 'blow', 'away', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'pre-order', 'season', 'four', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'counting', 'days', 'release']",Lost: Season 3
