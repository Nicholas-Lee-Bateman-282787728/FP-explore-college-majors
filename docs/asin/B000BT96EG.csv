948975,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B000BT96EG,Ben Milton,"[0, 2]","As I said in my review of season one, Dean Cain as Superman is very weak. His Superman would rather talk, and just stand there and fold his arms, than actually do something. Season two is more of the same, Robert Singer came along to produce this season. And the focus is more on the action, there's still romance in the air. Lois And Clark have their first kiss in this season, they start Dating. But wait, the assistant D.A Mason Drake loves Clark. That story line was totally wasted, it's almost like they didn't know quite how to handle it. So they just threw it in there, and after two episodes she's blown up in her car. Lois keeps getting mad at Clark for always running off, Now the biggest problem, is they throw in agent scardino. As kind of a rival to Clark for Lois's feelings, annnnd it just doesn't work. They don't give him much to work with, and the actor's not that good anyway. Now we come to the Tempus episode, H.G Wells has traveled to the future to see what it looks like. And he brings back Tempus,  Now Tempus doesn't like the future because there's ""140 channels with nothing on"", no violence. And he doesn't like it, so he's going to go into the past to kill Superman. A very well done episode, another one is ""Phoenix"". The return of Lex Luthor, who is after Lois. The only other good episode, is ""Seeing Red"", when intergang discovers Red Kryptonite. And uses it against Superman, they discover it makes him Apathetic. And Bruce Campbell plays Bill Church Jr., and he does a fantastic job. Yes Clark does propose at the end of this season, which ends with a cliffhanger to set up season 3. I won't give more than 2 stars, because there were too many moments, chracters, and episodes.

Superman DELIVERS...and it's  all SMASHING GOOD CLEAN FAMILY FUN, as always. My only gripe is that the Bond Girl didn't appear in more episodes.

(It didn't really jump the shark until Lois ate those frogs in season 3.)  Lois still doesn't know Clark's secret, but unfortunately Lex Luthor has disappeared as a regular nemesis. However, Lois and Clark's relationship, the real impetus of the series, heats up.  Overall, the villains aren't quite as campy as the following seasons.  This is the one that left everyone cliffhanging for the summer over what Lois was planning when she took off those glasses.  Would she say ""yes"" to his proposal?  Had she figured out his secret?

948987,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000BT96EG,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[2, 5]","I used to think that Smallville was much much better than Lois and Clark but now that Smallville is sorta depressing and predictable I think otherwise. Long before season 5 we knew that Clark can't be with Lana and now that Lana is with Lex things are even worse. Clark saved her life a hundred times and half the times she even knew it. So now she says she can't trust him and owes him nothing. Clark catches a bullet that almost hit Lana. Lana of course didn't see that and just because Lex stepped in front of her she says ""you saved me"". Was Lex even hit ?, No, so how did he save you ? So that's just an example of how bad Smallvillie is now. I find all that stuff painful to watch. We've seen too many episodes where Lana walks up the stairs to Clark's room to have some emotional talk.In this season of Lois and Clark, they decide to date and yes they have their problems but at least this show is light-hearted. When they argue about Clark always running off when they are having a serious conversation, you understan why Lois would be angry. Plus when they argue it's not as painful to watch or depressing like Clark or Lana having their 1000th conversation about him having too many secrets.There's a lot less Lex Luther this season, he comes back from the dead and shaves his head bald. He stalks Lois since he wants her back but she moved on and has feelings for Clark now. Anyway sadly Lex is only in one episode this season. The show manages fine without him though. Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers) does a good job as the Prankster in 2 episodes. He has it out for Lois since a story of her's put him in jail. There's also a good episode where Lois and Clark have to follow a man from the future into the past where he plans to kill superman where he's his most helpless...a baby. What makes it good is that he reveils to Lois that Clark is actually Superman. She has to try and get over being mad at Clark never telling her so she can help save his future. Smallville always has people finding out Clark's secret just to have their memory conveinently erased. This is the first time I actually saw it happen on Lois and Clark. While Smallville does it way too many times.Anyway though I think this is a good season, I think the show put Lois and Clark together too soon. It was sorta better before they started dating but I'd rather see mushy and cutsie episodes about them then see Clark and Lana have on more painful break-up on Smallville anyday.  Hell I'd prefer if they just had Lana leave Smallville period so can finally focus on stories that don't focus on Clark and Lana . Who's not tired of seeing him moping around looking sad about Lana. This show may be a bit overly silly sometimes but give me that over painful and depressing any day. I mean in the season finale of the last season, Lana told Clark she doesn't know why she ever loved him after everything he did for her.

948989,A1JF5GGQFSGP9Z,B000BT96EG,"Joseph Parker ""precisionspared""","[1, 2]","The first season is really the best and strongest of the show, though to really get everything out of the show you have to watch this one.  You have to realize that a lot of things that made the first season really great changed in season two, so that it could focus on the relationship tease between the title characters, which is done very well.  You lose a lot of the good for what is in a lot of cases something better, but you also get the first of the really bad cheesy episodes.  Not to say that all the episodes in the first season were stellar, but not to this level.  However the really good episodes here are even better than the really good ones of season one.  Season one is all about Lois and Clark meeting, and Superman having a fight with Lex Luther, with a lot of then ""modern"" references of female empowerment and so on.  I think that one of the more interesting parts of the show as a whole was that it really did demystify a lot of modern social norms and remind people what has worked in society for a long time, and tries to decorrupt a jaded modern world, though a lot of these attempts are a bit cheesy at best.  The second season is really the build to them getting together, which they eventually do, but you have to stick around for season 3 for the reveal that Clark is Superman, though it is brought up during the cliffhanger that is ultimately unsatisfying in the Season 3 opener. (If the bad episodes are starting to get to you I suggest that you download that first episode of season three, and the wedding episode from season 4 and call it a day with the show) and Season 4 is their life together, which really relieves most of the tension the show was building.  The other big changes for this season were that they got rid of the ensemble cast, or at least parts of it.  They got rid of the old Jimmy Olson, who at least to me seemed like a much more well rounded character in favor of a one dimensional hopeless romantic kid that seems to have lost the whole trying to live up to Perry story arch as now Perry just gives him bad dating advice, (Though the Denise Richards cameo is fun to watch) and admittedly a better looking guy, but not nearly as much fun.  Kat is gone completely, as the modern sexual implications that she brought I guess were just not where the show was going, as it seems to be more directed towards children this season, but there are no shortages of getting Lois to be in situations that allow her to get wet or messy in a variety of kinky costumes that show off her assets.  I mean there is a fight going on, and hey Teri, you are going to have a cat fight in the cake with the other girl, because Superman obviously can't handle another mortal female.  Not that I'm complaining, but they don't even hide what they are trying to do here.  Sometimes I felt like a schmuck for watching when really this was one of my favorite shows growing up, I guess I haven't changed as much as I like to think.

948999,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000BT96EG,Mark Baker,"[1, 1]","Season two picks up in the aftermath of Lex Luthor's (guest star John Shea) death.  Even though the villain has been unmasked, the citizens of Metropolis seem upset with Superman (Dean Cain).  Even more unsettling is the idea that Lex might not be dead.But Lex plays a minor role this season.  Intergang has moved into town in their disguise as CostMart and are attempting to take over the city.  But that's not all investigative reporters Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) and Clark Kent have to face this year.  There's the Prankster, an evil mastermind who wants to incorporate Lois into his criminal pranks.  A whistleblower is in danger when he discovers faulty products have been used.  Gangsters come back to life and start wrecking havoc on the city leading to Clark Kent's death.  A toy maker figures out a way to bottle greed and sell it to kids and adults right before Christmas.  Superman is sued by someone whose life he has saved.  And Jimmy Olsen (Justin Whalin) becomes a trained assassin.But since this is the romantic comedy take on the mythology, all this plays out against the backdrop of the building romance between Lois and Clark.  There are complications with love interests for each of them.  Clark struggles with maintaining his two identities and keeping them secret.  All this leads up to a cliffhanger aimed squarely at their relationship.And, best of all, it is fun.  The Christmas episode is the only clunker in the 22 episodes presented here.  Instead, we get cases that not only present decent mysteries but also find ways to challenge Superman.  It can't be easy to create new ways to put all the characters in danger each week.  (Although I do have to wonder if anyone in Metropolis checks for traffic before crossing the street.)And the romance is played perfectly.  Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain have perfect chemistry for the part.  They make it believable.  And their flirty dialogue is always fun if not downright funny.This set contains all 22 episodes from the season in full frame and stereo sound.  Extras are limited to an audio commentary on ""Season's Greedings"" by star and episode writer Dean Cain.  There are also two fetaurettes, one of the fans of the show and one on season two.The emphasis may be on the romance, but there is still plenty of action and superhero to please everyone.

The show underwent two major changes in the second season.  First, John Shea was no longer a series regular.  He only appeared in one episode where he was brought back to life after having died at the end of season 1.  As a result the show became a villain of the week format.  Many times notable guest stars were cast to play bad guys.  Some of the notables in season 2 were Bronson Pinchot (who those of us around in the 1980s remember from the short lived TV show Perfect Strangers) was wonderful as the Prankster, Raquel Welch, Michelle Phillips, Sherman Helmsly and Isabelle Sanford, Bruce Campbell and others.  While I do think the show did lose something not having John Shea in more episodes because he was fantastic as Lex Luthor, the format they established worked well.The second major change was recasting Jimmy Olson.  While I do not think Justin Whalen was horrible, I just think Michael Landes had so nailed the part in the first season, that the recast really hurt.  Especially at the beginning of the season. Had Whalen been cast from season one, I think he would have fit better.  The standout episodes of the season were Seasons Greetings, Tempus Fugitive, and the two Prankster episodes (The Prankster and Return of the Prankster).  The only story lines that I think got too overdone were the two separate love triangles.  First between Lois, Clark and Mayson Drake, then Lois, Clark and Gardino.  It just gave the story too much of a soap opera element.  The writers were obviously trying to keep Lois and Clark apart for as long as possible because a show like that always loses steam when the lead characters get together, but two separate love triangles in the same season was just a little overboard.  Especially since you essentially had a similar story in season 1 with Lois, Clark/Superman and Lex.The show really did hit its stride in season 2.  How much you enjoy it probably depends on where you fall on the changes in cast and how soap operaish it could get.  Twenty years on the show has held up well though.  The extras are fairly basic.  Commentary by Dean Cain on the episode Seasons Greedings which he wrote, a 10 min feature on season 2 with interviews of the cast and writers, and a short feature on the fan base of the show.  The A/V quality is about what you would expect from a mid 1990s show of that nature.  The special effects were better than in season 1, but nothing compared to what you would see today, and the picture is nowhere near the HD quality of the shows you get these days.  With that said however if you enjoyed the show when it was on, or even from seeing it in syndication it is definitely worth adding to your collection.",5,Season 2,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,2912,"['main', 'themes', 'first', 'season', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'were', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'vs', 'Superman', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'Clark/Superman', 'then', 'main', 'themes', 'season', '2', 'were', 'Would', 'get', 'together', 'Would', 'Lois', 'find', 'out', 'show', 'underwent', 'two', 'major', 'changes', 'second', 'season', 'First', 'John', 'Shea', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'series', 'regular', 'only', 'appeared', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'having', 'died', 'end', 'season', '1', 'result', 'show', 'became', 'villain', 'week', 'format', 'Many', 'times', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'cast', 'play', 'bad', 'guys', 'notables', 'season', '2', 'were', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'who', '1980s', 'remember', 'short', 'lived', 'TV', 'show', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Prankster', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Michelle', 'Phillips', 'Sherman', 'Helmsly', 'Isabelle', 'Sanford', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'others', 'do', 'think', 'show', 'did', 'lose', 'something', 'not', 'having', 'John', 'Shea', 'more', 'episodes', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'format', 'established', 'worked', 'well.The', 'second', 'major', 'change', 'was', 'recasting', 'Jimmy', 'Olson', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Justin', 'Whalen', 'was', 'horrible', 'just', 'think', 'Michael', 'Landes', 'had', 'so', 'nailed', 'part', 'first', 'season', 'recast', 'really', 'hurt', 'Especially', 'beginning', 'season', 'Had', 'Whalen', 'been', 'cast', 'season', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'better', 'standout', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'Seasons', 'Greetings', 'Tempus', 'Fugitive', 'two', 'Prankster', 'episodes', 'Prankster', 'Return', 'Prankster', 'only', 'story', 'lines', 'think', 'got', 'too', 'overdone', 'were', 'two', 'separate', 'love', 'triangles', 'First', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Mayson', 'Drake', 'then', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Gardino', 'just', 'gave', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'soap', 'opera', 'element', 'writers', 'were', 'obviously', 'trying', 'keep', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'apart', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'show', 'always', 'steam', 'when', 'lead', 'characters', 'get', 'together', 'two', 'separate', 'love', 'triangles', 'same', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'overboard', 'Especially', 'essentially', 'had', 'similar', 'story', 'season', '1', 'Lois', 'Clark/Superman', 'Lex.The', 'show', 'really', 'did', 'hit', 'stride', 'season', '2', 'How', 'much', 'enjoy', 'probably', 'where', 'fall', 'changes', 'cast', 'how', 'soap', 'operaish', 'could', 'get', 'Twenty', 'years', 'show', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'extras', 'are', 'fairly', 'basic', 'Commentary', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'episode', 'Seasons', 'Greedings', 'wrote', '10', 'min', 'feature', 'season', '2', 'interviews', 'cast', 'writers', 'short', 'feature', 'fan', 'base', 'show', 'A/V', 'quality', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'mid', '1990s', 'show', 'nature', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'better', 'season', '1', 'nothing', 'compared', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'today', 'picture', 'nowhere', 'HD', 'quality', 'shows', 'get', 'days', 'said', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'even', 'seeing', 'syndication', 'definitely', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 2

The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I am so happy that that the fans are finally getting a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would.

949010,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BT96EG,Robert Moore,"[6, 8]","Warning:  Spoilers in review!Season Two was both very similar to Season One and very different.  It was different in that the show underwent some very significant cast changes.  It was same in that the romantic chemistry between Lois and Clark continued to be very much at the fore front.  In fact, as in Season One, the major concern in the show was the progress of their romance.Going into Season Two, ABC decided that the show needed more of a family slant.  They therefore had the show remove Tracy Scoggins, who had played the ultra sensual Catherine 'Cat' Grant in Season One, from the cast.  Her hypersexual mode of behavior and dress was seen as nonconducive to creating the proper family atmosphere.  My own feeling is that her character was never successfully integrated into the show and therefore her absence was not a great loss.  I was more troubled by the decision to replace Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen.  The reasoning was that Landes and Dean Cain were too similar as physical types.  They didn't look exactly alike, but both were tall, lean, and dark-haired.  They could plausibly have passed for brothers.  Nonetheless, I liked Landes and the place he occupied in the first season.  Justin Whalin, who was stockier, had lighter hair, a much fuller face, and seemed to be slightly shorter, replaced him.  Under no circumstances could he have been mistaken for Dean Cain's brother.  While I didn't feel that Landes's dismissal from the show was justified, Whalin also did a fine job as Olsen, though all in all I think the two did an equally good job in the role.  The third major cast change was the departure of John Shea from the show as a full time cast member.  Watchers of the show will recall that he died at the end of the Season One finale.  He was brought back briefly in Season Two, sans hair, and made a few additional appearances in the show later.  But for all practical purposes, Shea was gone.  The threatening presence of Lex Luthor was replaced by the crime syndicate Intergang.But the romance was the thing.  The original model for LOIS AND CLARK was always the romantic comedies of classic Hollywood.  The show owed more to the interplay between Nick and Nora Charles than to any superhero show.  The previous TV show that most accurately captures its spirit was MOONLIGHTING.  There is no question that Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain had tremendous onscreen chemistry.  They were not merely a devastatingly gorgeous couple; they were a wonderfully fun to watch.  The season saw a gradual alteration in their relationship.  Season One had ended with Clark first declaring his love for Lois, only to have her reject it, only then to have her return his advances after he had decided that their being together was perhaps not a good idea.  In Season Two, however, the heart, as Robert Frost put it, began to cloud the mind, and Clark eventually summoned up the courage to ask Lois out on a date, and Lois summoned up the courage to accept.  Their romance saw a few bumps towards the end of the season, but Season Two ended with Clark on bended knee, an engagement ring in his hand, awaiting Lois's response to his proposal.  The one truly irritating moment in the season was unquestionably the words ""To be continued . . . "" that concluded the finale.As in Season One, the romance between Lois and Clark always too precedent over Superman's crime fighting adventures.  Nonetheless, the individual crises were a bit more compelling this year.  There were several compelling adventures.  My favorite--and the romantic highlight of the year--was the episode ""Tempus Fugitive,"" in which H. G. Wells in his time machine enables a criminal from the future to return in time to a point where he can undo Superman and prevent the future utopia that resulted from the union of Superman and Lois Lane.  The criminal, Tempus, played with great gusto by Lane Davies, reveals to Lois just who Superman really is.  Much of the episode deals with Lois's intense anger at Clark/Superman for not having been honest with her and asking him how she could ever come to trust him again.  Meanwhile they frustrate Tempus in his goal of undoing Utopia and Wells returns them to their own time to the point at which they will not remember what had just happened, telling them that it wasn't yet the right time for Lois to learn about Clark (implying that there would come such a time in the future).  The episode was so successful that both Wells and Tempus would make additional appearances on the show, Tempus several times.So, the second season of the show came to an end, this time with the cliffhanger of what Lois was going to say to Clark.  Makes you wish that the next set in the series was being released sooner rather than later, doesn't it?",5,Another fun season from the romantic adventures of Lois and Clark,1138665600,"01 31,

949011,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000BT96EG,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[5, 7]","Building off of great Season 1 ratings, Lois and Clark continued retelling Superman's saga through Clark Kent's historically-underappreciated perspective. 44 episodes of the 1994-1995 season balance a perfect mix of romance, intrigue, and adventure to `home deliver' the best 'news copy' around.""Madame Ex"" is an excellent example of such quality. Lois was engaged to marry Lex Luthor (John Shea) at one point, but she learns that he simultaneously had tried to marry another woman. Arianna Carlin (Emma Sams) comes back in a fiendish plot to take out Superman and makes an evil copy of Lois. Because Carlin forgot to actually take out Lois first, the real Lois investigates her double with Clark and saves the day. In this version of the epic, Lois is a `superhero' in her own right.This episode is also important because it marks the first appearance of Justin Whalin as Jimmy Olsen. Whalin replaced Michael Landes from the previous season because he looks more boyish and supposedly did not resemble series star Dean Cain.Farrah Forke begins her special guest-staring role as District Attorney Mayson Drake in the episode ""Church of Metropolis"". This immaculately-coiffed and dressed law enforcement official repeatedly attempts to investigate Intergang---and get her personal hooks into Clark. Because Lois is aware of her own growing feelings toward Clark, she becomes jealous of this relationship. Drake is a recurring character throughout most of this season, inadvertently providing comic relief with her pretense to know everything about everything. Drake dies in ""Lucky Leon"".Another (and intentional) form of comic relief was ""A Bolt From The Blue"". Superman's powers temporarily extend to William Wallace Webster Walldecker (Leslie Jordan) when they are both struck by lightning during a suicide rescue attempt. Realizing that he now has 'superpowers', the man and his wife Wandamae (played by Cindy Williams, who is of course best known for 'Laverne and Shirley') charge people for `Resplendent Man' services-infuriating Clark who always did `Superman' out of kindness. On top of this, the evil Dr. Gretchen Kelly (Denise Crosby) figures that Superman's powers can be duplicated for criminal gain and subsequently attempts to capture Lois for'bait'. She knows that Lois is the most valuable thing to Superman and he does anything to save her-including risk himself. Dr. Kelly would make another appearance, resurrecting Lex Luthor in ""The Phoenix"".Clark might have other-worldly powers, but he is not immune to diabolical plots as `Season Greedings"" (written by series star Dean Cain himself) demonstrated. Sherman Hemlsely and Isabel Sanford reunite from their ""The Jeffersons"" days to play a diabolical toymaker couple attempting world control by turning everybody into children. They really do a fabulous job of acting like vengeful people who don't have a molecule of the holiday spirit inside of them. I also liked the performance Cain gives as the 'childish' Clark just because it was so cute to see the one-time professional linebacker running around with a tantrum. Curiously/thankfully Clark did not use any of his superpowers during his tantrum though.""The Eyes Have It"" is a more serious episode because it poses the question what would happen if a scientist had something strong enough to make Superman go blind-even temporarily. While people are convinced Clark Kent escaped to the mountains with Mayson Drake, he is really (as Superman) recuperating with Lois's help. Since Clark does not usually get sick or hurt, he immediately understands how serious his situation is and also realizes his 'recovery period' marks somewhat of a relationship turning point with Lois. Lois does not know who he really is, but (unlike many other Metropolis residents) honestly does not expect Superman to be flawless and invulnerable. Instead, she helps him when he needs it (and presumably had no where else to go).Superman encountered another personal nightmare during ""Whine, Whine, Whine"". A musician (Jason Carter) decides to sue Superman for allegedly injuring him during a rescue. Calvin Dregg believes the 'man of steel' broke his arm and wants to take Superman to court for recovery of damages- financial and emotional. Clark is very physically strong, but also prides himself on not hurting innocent people with those powers; both the initial claim and ensuing copy caters become a veritable PR nightmare. Because Superman lacks 'contact information', going to court for this and the other claims also consequently threatens Clark Kent's secret. Here again, Superman heavily depends on Lois for emotional support and counsel; she exposes the initial 'injury claim' itself as only being a scam artist's hoax. Both Adam West and Frank Gorshin (who worked together on the far campier 60's 'Batman' series) put in special guest appearances during the episode.Uncovering Superman's real identity is a repeating threat up to the end of this season. First, Diana Stride, (Raquel Welch) an assassin for Intergang who poses as the host of the tabloid TV show ""Top Copy"" wants to tell the world Clark Kent's secret  in ""Top Copy"". Contrasting with Lois and Clark, Stride is a tabloid journalist who specializes in the sensationalistic junk which the Daily Planet does not even consider publishing on back pages. Because several tabloid news shows were then-on television, the episode is also a real-life reference to the problems which tabloid series ultimately create for journalism the profession. Initially-popular tabloid TV shows subsequently diminish the credibility of all journalists because the public then expects the later to also report news in a sensationalistic manner and at all costs; ironically becoming upset when all their news sounds the same.Lois finds out Clark's secret in ""Tempus Fugitive"". They have to travel back in time to 1966 Smallville with H.G. Wells (Terry Kiser) to prevent Tempus Fugit (Lane Davies) from killing the baby Superman. For if there is no Superman, Fugit and other criminals of the world can stay above the law.  Understandably, Lois is jarred by this news---her co-worker from 'no-whereseville' is THE Superman, but it does explain Clark's frequent disappearances (which increasingly had gotten on her nerves). Unfortunately, that knowledge gets quickly erased and Lois once again becomes exasperated with Clark's behavior in subsequent episodes. We would not receive permanent resolution of their tension until later seasons.It's Clark's turn to become jealous when Lois gets involved with Agent Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri). Scardino is sent to probe Drake's death and subsequently arouses Clark's own resentment. Even a mild-mannered reporter from Kansas becomes caught in the battle for a woman's affections when he realizes that Lois Lane is in fact ""Ms. Right for him"". Clark also concludes that he must act on the desire to be with Lois.  He proposes to Lois during the genuinely cliff-hanging season finale ""And The Answer Is...""Extras in this package include ""Lois and Clark: Secrets of Season 2"", ""Marketing Metropolis: The Fans of Lois and Clark"", and a commentary on the ""Seasons Greedings"" episode by Dean Cain himself. I'm appreciative that the people involved with this series have an understanding of just how much it still means to fans and are not above continuing to work with it. Kudos to Dean Cain himself for giving fans the `inside scoop' on this beloved series.",5,"Extra, Extra---Lane and Kent Investigate Intergang.",1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,7439,"['Building', 'great',

Developed by Deborah Joy LeVine (Dawson's Creek) and a brilliant staff of series writers including Hilary J. Bader (Superman: The Animated Series), Lois & Clark takes the Man of Steel on his most exciting and challenging adventure of all - rivalry & romance (and later marriage) with Lois Lane!Changes this season include Justin Whalin (Dungeons & Dragons) taking over the role of Jimmy Olsen, and the international criminal organization Intergang taking over the late (not for long) Lex Luthor's bid for control of Metropolis and plans to kill Superman.

949014,A2LEJ063QW77GW,B000BT96EG,"Srinivas Chavala ""bobby""","[0, 1]","Lois & Clark came along way for married duo for a long time. They're relationship, in real life a lot of people would give anything what Lois & Clark have in real life. They had a lot a ups and downs it was worth it to get them together. Out of all the t.v. shows of Superman shows I seen, no one could do what these could do. I never have to worry about Dean Cain being typecast as Superman or the Superman curse. He's doing just fine, the difference between George Reeves as Superman and Dean Cain Superman is George Reeves's Superman is a like a Saturday Morning Cartoon show. Have the time when he plays Clark Kent, Jack Larson plays Jimmy Olsen and Noelle Carter plays Lois Lane. They're like playing Ward, Beaver and June Cleaver in Leave it to Beaver. George Reeves and Jimmy Olsen were like father and son, than friends. Dean Cain is playing Superman, he was like a teenager than can't grow up and I saw another side Clark Kent I never seen before. He has feelings, problems and he was scared all the time. When he was Superman, that he was just like a regular person like everybody else, the show was revolve around Clark Kent than Superman. Dean Cain love playing Clark Kent than Superman, Superman is kind of symbol for good and hope, has to follow truth, justice and the american way. Even though I hated that slogan truth, justice and the american way, they're just words but to me Superman is guy a like to help. Clark Kent has feelings, problems, trips, nerdy, sarcastic, he can say anything he want more than Superman than does and perverted like me. That's the reason, how I admired Clark Kent in the first place. When I was watching Smallville, the relationship of Lois and Lana are kind of the like the same relationship as Lois and Clark. The same was, Lois was trying to get close to Clark, he always leave when theirs danger when they were talking about something important. A lot of times Clark always wanted to tell Lois who he was, never had a chance to. But he did and they're still together. That's the same relationship with him and Lana had in Smallville, but the difference is when Lana found she was a target and nearly got killed by Lex. When Clark went back in time and didn't tell her. That's the reason, why he never tells anybody who he is somebody could be a target or trust. When Teri Hatcher was playing Lois Lane, in a couple episodes she was Clark's Rival, to best friend and girlfriend. Lois Lane was compared to in Smallvlle, as Lana Lang and Chloe Sullivan.

949015,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000BT96EG,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*I loved the first season of LOIS & CLARK.  I thought it was absolutely wonderful.  It was charming, witty, original, creative, fresh, and romantic, a delightful re-telling of the Superman legend.  I was excited to begin the second season, but a little cautious because of the infamous ""sophomore slump"" that many shows endure.  Season Two does have the dreaded sophomore slump, but thankfully, it's only a mild case.A lot happened in Season Two.  ""The Prankster"" introduced one of the few villains from the Superman comics to actually appear on LOIS & CLARK: The Prankster, rather annoyingly played by Bronson Pichot.  Intergang, a major crime organization from the Superman comics, makes its first appearance in ""Church of Metropolis"".  Another Superman villain appears in ""Metallo"" (can you guess who?), as does Lois Lane's (Teri Hatcher) sister, Lucy Lane.  In ""That Old Gang Of Mine"", a scientist clones 1930s gangsters like Al Capone, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde, and Superman (Dean Cain) must stop them.  ""Season's Greedings"", written by Dean Cain, is one of the series' most ridiculous episodes, but it does feature guest appearances from Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford (who played the title characters on the TV show THE JEFFERSONS), as well as a young Denise Richards.  The season really improves when ""The Phoenix"" hits, a magnificent episode in which a bald (!) Lex Luthor (John Shea) is resurrected. Red kryptonite was introduced in ""Individual Responsibility"", although on LOIS & CLARK red kryptonite makes Superman bored and sleazy rather than evil and reckless as it did in the comics and everything else.  ""Tempus Fugitive"" is one of the most popular episodes of any 90's TV series and is regarded by many fans as the best episode of LOIS & CLARK.  In that episode, H.G. Wells (Terry Kiser - Bernie in WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S) builds a time machine and travels to 1990s Metropolis, where his evil partner Tempus (Lane Davies) steals the machine and travels back to 1966 Smallville to destroy Superman.  Lois and Clark go back in time to stop him - and the biggest secret in the world is discovered, if only for a fleeting moment.The real thing that keeps this season going is the romance between Clark Kent, Superman, and Lois Lane.  It really heats up toward the end of the season, especially during the season finale, during which I guarantee you'll be shouting at your TV screen quite often.  The rain-soaked cliffhanger is at once shocking and disappointing, but you won't want to miss it.  To complicate Lois and Clark's relationship, the writers came up with two characters: the immensely irritating Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri), and the tragic Mason Drake (Farrah Forke).The problem with the second season of LOIS & CLARK is that it lacks the freshness and creativity of Season One, to the point where it becomes immensely silly.  Too silly.  The villains are far too over-the-top, with the exception of John Shea's Lex Luthor, who is wonderful.  What redeems the season is that every once in a while something astonishing happens.  The most astonishing moment of all is a death scene at the end of ""Lucky Leon"".  It's an incredibly powerful scene made all the more so by Jay Gruska's beautiful music, which is subpar throughout the rest of the season.  The visual effects range from being very good to very hokey, but that doesn't really detract much from one's enjoyment of the show.I realize, and by now you probably do too, that I am having a hard time putting my thoughts on paper (so to speak).  That's because I adored the first season of this show, and I have many thoughts on the second.  Let me just say that though the season is silly and occasionally hokey, it is almost always fun.  You may want to stop watching mid-point, but if you stick with it 'till the season's end, you won't regret it.",4,"A silly, occasionally hokey, but consistently fun sophomore season",1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,3860,"['*POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'WITHIN*I', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'was', 'charming', 'witty', 'original', 'creative', 'fresh', 'romantic', 'delightful', 're-telling', 'Superman', 'legend', 'was', 'excited', 'begin', 'second', 'season', 'little', 'cautious', 'infamous', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'many', 'shows', 'endure', 'Season', 'Two', 'have', 'dreaded', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'thankfully', 'only', 'mild', 'case.A', 'lot', 'happened', 'Season', 'Two', 'Prankster', 'introduced', 'one', 'few', 'villains', 'Superman', 'comics', 'actually', 'appear', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'Prankster', 'rather', 'annoyingly', 'played', 'Bronson', 'Pichot', 'Intergang', 'major', 'crime', 'organization', 'Superman', 'comics', 'first', 'appearance', 'Church', 'Metropolis', 'Superman', 'villain', 'Metallo', 'can', 'guess', 'who', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'sister', 'Lucy', 'Lane', 'Old', 'Gang', 'Mine', 'scientist', '1930s', 'gangsters', 'Al', 'Capone', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Superman', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'must', 'stop', 'Season', 'Greedings', 'written', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'one', 'series', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'episodes', 'feature', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'characters', 'TV', 'show', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'season', 'really', 'when', 'Phoenix', 'hits', 'magnificent', 'episode', 'bald', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'John', 'Shea', 'resurrected', 'Red', 'kryptonite', 'was', 'introduced', 'Individual', 'Responsibility', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'Superman', 'bored', 'sleazy', 'rather', 'evil', 'reckless', 'did', 'comics', 'everything', 'else', 'Tempus', 'Fugitive', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'episodes', '90', 'TV', 'series', 'regarded', 'many', 'fans', 'best', 'episode', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'episode', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Terry', 'Kiser', 'Bernie', 'WEEKEND', 'AT', 'BERNIE', 'time', 'machine', 'travels', '1990s', 'Metropolis', 'where', 'evil', 'partner', 'Tempus', 'Lane', 'Davies', 'machine', 'travels', 'back', '1966', 'Smallville', 'destroy', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'biggest', 'secret', 'world', 'discovered', 'only', 'fleeting', 'moment.The', 'real', 'thing', 'season', 'going', 'romance', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'really', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'especially', 'season', 'finale', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shouting', 'TV', 'screen', 'quite', 'often', 'rain-soaked', 'cliffhanger', 'once', 'shocking', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'complicate', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'relationship', 'writers', 'came', 'up', 'two', 'characters', 'immensely', 'irritating', 'Dan', 'Scardino', 'Jim', 'Pirri', 'tragic', 'Mason', 'Drake', 'Farrah', 'Forke', '.The', 'problem', 'second', 'season', 'LOIS', 'CLARK', 'freshness', 'creativity', 'Season', 'One', 'point', 'where', 'immensely', 'silly', 'Too', 'silly', 'villains', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'exception', 'John', 'Shea', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'wonderful', 'What', 'season', 'once', 'while', 'something', 'astonishing', 'happens', 'most', 'astonishing', 'moment', 'death', 'scene', 'end', 'Lucky', 'Leon', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'scene', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'Jay', 'Gruska', 'beautiful', 'music', 'subpar', 'rest', 'season', 'visual', 'effects', 'range', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'hokey', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'much', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'show.I', 'realize', 'now', 'probably', 'do', 'too', 'am', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'thoughts', 'paper', 'so', 'speak', 'adored', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'have', 'many', 'thoughts', 'second', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'season', 'silly', 'occasionally', 'hokey', 'almost', 'always', 'fun', 'may', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'mid-point', 'stick', 'season', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 2
