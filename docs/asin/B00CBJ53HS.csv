There are striking similarities between Copper and the book City of Eros: NYC, Prostitution and the Commercialization of sex, 1790-1920 and I believe that is one reason why I have enjoyed the series so much since the writers are going about the stories from an historical angle.

(Argh!)However, before that bit of agony the story is again as tightly written and plotted as the first. Kevin, having solved the mystery of his wife and daughter, now is having to deal with the powers of Tammany Hall. This again, while a very important part of American history, is not something that is explored as often as it could be in the modern American psyche. Politicians are making plays for Kevin's beloved Five Points. Money is of course, the biggest power, and while Kevin doesn't have any himself, he does know people who do. He continues to use his own moral compass to guide himself, operating at times against what the law would have him do.His friendships (especially with Doctor Freeman) are very tested, and strengthened or weakened at various times. We have a huge leap in character growth for Doctor Freeman's wife, Sarah (which is fantastic! most of the women of the show were a bit too spineless for me in the first season, seeing her step up in a big way was great). We also get some new cast members, Sarah's mother, played by Alfre Woodard, a Baldwin brother and Donal Logue.Kyle Schmid is especially great as Robert Moorehouse, and of course Tom Weston-Jones does a great job carrying off the title role.",4,This Show Needed a Third Season!,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,1411,"['really', 'pity', 'season', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly.It', 'ends', 'promise', 'more', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'hanging', 'mystery', 'Argh', 'However', 'bit', 'agony', 'story', 'again', 'as', 'tightly', 'written', 'plotted', 'first', 'Kevin', 'having', 'solved', 'mystery', 'wife', 'daughter', 'now', 'having', 'deal', 'powers', 'Tammany', 'Hall', 'again', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'American', 'history', 'not', 'something', 'explored', 'as', 'often', 'could', 'be', 'modern', 'American', 'psyche', 'Politicians', 'are', 'making', 'plays', 'Kevin', 'beloved', 'Five', 'Points', 'Money', 'course', 'biggest', 'power', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'use', 'own', 'moral', 'compass', 'guide', 'operating', 'times', 'what', 'law', 'would', 'have', 'do.His', 'friendships', 'especially', 'Doctor', 'Freeman', 'are', 'very', 'tested', 'strengthened', 'weakened', 'various', 'times', 'have', 'huge', 'leap', 'character', 'growth', 'Doctor', 'Freeman', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'fantastic', 'most', 'women', 'show', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'spineless', 'first', 'season', 'seeing', 'step', 'up', 'big', 'way', 'was', 'great', 'also', 'get', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'played', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Baldwin', 'brother', 'Donal', 'Logue.Kyle', 'Schmid', 'especially', 'great', 'Robert', 'Moorehouse', 'course', 'Tom', 'Weston-Jones', 'great', 'job', 'carrying', 'off', 'title', 'role']",Copper: Season 2
