I had no idea there was a sequel and my family and I are big fans of the original. It is a staple of our annual Christmas viewing. This sequel stays true to the original both visually and in it's use of beautifully moving music in lieu of dialog, though updated with some minor modern treatments that, thankfully, don't detract from the overall beauty of the film. Highly recommended.Side note: where's the dad from the original? Divorced? Dead? At any rate, it is implied now that this is a single-parent family.",5,A Worthy Sequel to the Original Classic,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,604,"['found', 'DVD', 'accident', 'rummaging', 'bargain', 'bin', 'Christmas', 'films', 'K-Mart', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'was', 'sequel', 'family', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'original', 'staple', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'viewing', 'sequel', 'true', 'original', 'visually', 'use', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'music', 'lieu', 'dialog', 'updated', 'minor', 'modern', 'treatments', 'thankfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'beauty', 'film', 'Highly', 'recommended.Side', 'note', 'where', 'dad', 'original', 'Divorced', 'Dead', 'rate', 'implied', 'now', 'single-parent', 'family']",The Snowman & The Snowdog

A young boy moves with his mother to a new home. There's a sad event but I won't spoil it for you; suffice to say that the young man discovers something under the floorboards in his bedroom - a snowman decorating kit! It starts snowing and the boy is off to make a snowman and on a whim, he make a snowdog too. Fans of the original will know that the boy is soon to experience something magical, and will be taking flight with the snowman and his new companion, the snowdog to a a far-off, magical land, where they play with other snowmen and get to experience a magical Christmas. The young boy discovers that dreams and wishes do come true, and all is well, as it should be this magical time of year.This makes the perfect stocking stuffer for Christmas, and my 8.5-year-old daughter and I truly enjoyed the show. It runs about 70 mins, and like the original contains no dialogue, just a wonderful accompanying soundtrack that brings to mind delightful holiday memories. There's bonus features such as a behind the scenes documentary and an interview with Raymond Briggs. All in all, a delightful sequel that makes for a magical viewing experience, for both young and old alike.",5,"When the Snowman takes flight, again!",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,1299,"['loved', 'original', '34', 'Snowman', '34', 'then', 'poignant', 'charming', 'sequel', 'certain', 'warm', 'heart', 'young', 'boy', 'moves', 'mother', 'new', 'home', 'sad', 'event', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'suffice', 'say', 'young', 'man', 'something', 'floorboards', 'bedroom', 'snowman', 'decorating', 'kit', 'snowing', 'boy', 'make', 'snowman', 'whim', 'make', 'snowdog', 'too', 'Fans', 'original', 'will', 'know', 'boy', 'soon', 'experience', 'something', 'magical', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'flight', 'snowman', 'new', 'companion', 'snowdog', 'far-off', 'magical', 'land', 'where', 'play', 'other', 'snowmen', 'get', 'experience', 'magical', 'Christmas', 'young', 'boy', 'discovers', 'dreams', 'wishes', 'do', 'come', 'true', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'magical', 'time', 'year.This', 'perfect', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'Christmas', '8.5-year-old', 'daughter', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'show', '70', 'mins', 'original', 'dialogue', 'just', 'wonderful', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'mind', 'delightful', 'holiday', 'memories', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'interview', 'Raymond', 'Briggs', 'delightful', 'sequel', 'magical', 'viewing', 'experience', 'young', 'old', 'alike']",The Snowman & The Snowdog
