The Hives, The Vines, The Strokes... there all the same to several people. But with any new/popular style, you get the groundbreakers, one of which is The White Stripes. The garage rock revival has brought a lot of great music to people who felt suffocated by the nausea infested, overproduced pop music, with little to know substance. ""Under Blackpool Lights"" shows Jack White as the blues/rock guitar god that he is.Despite the presence of any special features whatsoever, the concert rocks enough on it's own to justify the purchase. The sound is excellent, and the picture is so-so, which gives you that real ""garage rock"" feel. It's just Jack and Meg up there, rocking the show to it's fullest. Jack jams out a hell of a show, belting out solos flawlessly. Meg is her usual self, swaying her head around in tranquility, feeding off of the energy that Jack puts forth. The unity between the two really stands out.The White Stripes are the real thing.

Even sitting in the comfort of my own home, I wanted to jump up and pogo with the audience. Ever hear people say they have a hole in their sound? Ha! Watch this my friend. Prepare to get a hurricane of sound thrown your way, with the energy and electricty of a lightning storm. Jack is like a mad scientist on stage, constantly tweeking, switching, improvising, concocting fantastic potions of sound. Raw, undiluted, pure- the way any performance should be. Watching this makes you wonder why other bands bother with 2 or 3 more members. I read a review of one of their performances once where the guy said how you can't believe you got your ass kicked my just two people. Exactly. If you're not already a believer, this performance should make you one.In their version of Jolene, Jack wails with the pain and intensity of someone who knows the sentiment of the song.As you watch, you begin to understand that, unlike most bands who get up on stage and showboat and puke out what's on their CD, the White Stripes get on stage to please themselves, and along the way ultimately satisfy anyone listening.

For two people they sure make a lot of music. Completely ingrossing and utterly enjoyable. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The only thing I did not like was the fuzzy style camera filter{which personally I do not enjoy}, I would think that having a clear and many angled focus, would have been much better.

I have been to see them live twice and was consistently blown away at their live performance.  So why the low score on this review?  Meg and Jack were spot on as always, unfortunately this video both looks and sounds as if it were shot on a cell phone.  Now I was okay with the grainy video, I know they are an anti-establishment band and the grainy look goes with their vibe.  It would have been nice had it been inter cut with some higher quality shots so that we could actually see both Jack and Meg, specifically since they are such wonderful entertainers.My biggest problem is with the sound, it's the tinny metallic sound of someone recording without being plugged into the sound board.  The same as if you were to take a camera to the concert and record it yourself, the quality just isn't there.  Sadly I couldn't listen though this from beginning to end because the terrible sound made Jack sound as if he was mumbling and the guitar just sounded terrible, I ended up with a migraine rather than a fun evening of dirty Detroit rock.  If you didn't already know the words to his music, you certainly won't be able to pick them out on this DVD.I love the band, and had really high hopes for this DVD, unfortunately I am very happy that I rented rather than purchased.  True all of their great songs are included on the DVD, they just don't sound any good.  And since you can't really make out what they are doing due to the grainy video, you really can't get into the vibe of it all.

If you do not own ""Under Blackpool Lights"" then I've gotta tell you to buy it because, for one thing, I really shouldn't have to need anything to back it up with, but if you really want to know why someone would, well here's why:It's got all of the stuff that the Stripes did before that album. Besides, there are some things that are worthy of being seen. I thought the guitar solo on the studio version of ""Ball and Buscuit"" was great, but listen to this on the DVD. It's amazing how it sounds on here. That is one of the reasons you should buy it.If you're a casual fan, don't worry. Even though Jack doesn't ever perform his stateside breakthrough, most of the hits are performed anyway. I really like the drum clicking of ""The Hardest Button to Button"" and the crowd seemed excited too. Also performed was easily their most popular song ever, ""Seven Nation Army"". It's performed basically how you'd expect. But then again, this live DVD was pretty much what I expected.Even when the electric piano is used like in ""Apple Blossom"" or the organs on ""Truth Doesn't Make a Noise"", he doesn't forget to rock with the guitar.You also get two Son House covers in a row (both faithful in that they are both done very bluesy), the great ""Jolene"" rendition (which you may have heard), as well as covers from obscure bands who only really were known in their local areas.There's also the big morph they have after the first two songs, which includes covers of Bob Dylan and Ledbetter. There's also two original Stripes songs in that mix as well as another cover.It did not thrill me like the Cure's ""Trilogy"" DVD, but nothing really does to be honest. It just gets a four because for whatever reason I feel that there was something missing, I don't really know what it was. I don't know if the DVD I had was the problem, but the sound quality was even a bit rough for my tastes in general. But I don't understand how you won't like this if you like the White Stripes.",4,A solid performance that will appease you,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,2063,"['are', 'White', 'Stripes', 'fan', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'feel', 'new', 'record', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'Blackpool', 'Lights', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'buy', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'need', 'anything', 'back', 'up', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'well', 'here', 'why', 'got', 'stuff', 'Stripes', 'did', 'album', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'worthy', 'being', 'seen', 'thought', 'guitar', 'solo', 'studio', 'version', 'Ball', 'Buscuit', 'was', 'great', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'how', 'here', 'one', 'reasons', 'should', 'buy', ""'re"", 'casual', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Even', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'ever', 'perform', 'stateside', 'breakthrough', 'most', 'hits', 'are', 'performed', 'anyway', 'really', 'drum', 'clicking', 'Hardest', 'Button', 'Button', 'crowd', 'seemed', 'excited', 'too', 'Also', 'performed', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'popular', 'song', 'ever', 'Seven', 'Nation', 'Army', 'performed', 'basically', 'how', ""'d"", 'expect', 'then', 'again', 'live', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected.Even', 'when', 'electric', 'piano', 'used', 'Apple', 'Blossom', 'organs', 'Truth', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Noise', ""n't"", 'forget', 'rock', 'guitar.You', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'Son', 'House', 'row', 'faithful', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'bluesy', 'great', 'Jolene', 'rendition', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'as', 'well', 'covers', 'obscure', 'bands', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'were', 'known', 'local', 'areas.There', 'also', 'big', 'morph', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'songs', 'covers', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Ledbetter', 'also', 'two', 'original', 'Stripes', 'songs', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'cover.It', 'did', 'not', 'thrill', 'Cure', 'Trilogy', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'really', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'four', 'reason', 'feel', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'DVD', 'had', 'was', 'problem', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'even', 'bit', 'rough', 'tastes', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'like', 'White', 'Stripes']",White Stripes: Under Blackpool Lights (Cancelled)
