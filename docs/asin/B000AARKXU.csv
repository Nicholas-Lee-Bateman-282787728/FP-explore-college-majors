925702,A2QKDNZY2QT16M,B000AARKXU,D. Talbot,"[0, 0]","I cannot swoon enough about this beautiful masterpiece. Amici, unfortunately, has been disbanded. Capture their exquisite harmony and solos while still possible. Nick Garrett, one of the singers, also plays piano at the pro level, and this DVD features him accompanying the others as well as himself. Even if you hate opera, you should consider buying this disc. It was featured on PBS not so long ago. Amici called themselves an &#34;opera band&#34;, and it is a description that fits. They are unique in their treatment of pop songs with both a symphonic and an operatic quality.",5,Best music DVD of all time,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,581,"['can', 'not', 'swoon', 'enough', 'beautiful', 'masterpiece', 'Amici', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'disbanded', 'Capture', 'exquisite', 'harmony', 'solos', 'still', 'possible', 'Nick', 'Garrett', 'one', 'singers', 'also', 'piano', 'pro', 'level', 'DVD', 'accompanying', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'hate', 'opera', 'should', 'consider', 'buying', 'disc', 'was', 'featured', 'PBS', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Amici', 'called', '34', 'opera', 'band', '34', 'description', 'are', 'unique', 'treatment', 'pop', 'songs', 'symphonic', 'operatic', 'quality']",N/A

I own the cds, and it was wonderful to put faces with the voices.  A great selection of songs and a very enjoyable performance.  My only fault with this production, and maybe it's just me, but it seemed like the sound wasn't always the greatest.  And as I say, it could be just me.  Don't let that stop you, however.

925705,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B000AARKXU,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[5, 5]","I was blown away by Amici Forever! Five gifted vocalists come together to create the first ""opera band.""  These young performers can help make opera/classical singing accessible to a pop music-inundated world.  (Don't get me wrong, I love rock and pop, but this singing style is so beautiful, that I hope performers like Amici Forever can garner opera a wider audience.)The vocals were great.  The solos, the harmonies, the vocal blend...it all came together. The singers had extraordinary stage presence:  their movements were marked with grace as they performed simple choreography while singing.The orchestra and background dancers all looked extremely young, complementing the youthful (late 20s, early 30s) opera band.  My only complaint against this DVD is that I wanted more material on the special features.  I would have liked interviews, more behind-the-concert footage, etc.Oh, as an aside, David Habbin--what a hottie, eye (& ear) candy for the female audience.  And Nick Garrett's bass baritone could woo any woman.",5,I can't praise this DVD enough!,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1028,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'Amici', 'Forever', 'Five', 'gifted', 'vocalists', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'first', 'opera', 'band', 'young', 'performers', 'can', 'help', 'make', 'opera/classical', 'singing', 'accessible', 'pop', 'music-inundated', 'world', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'rock', 'pop', 'singing', 'style', 'so', 'beautiful', 'hope', 'performers', 'Amici', 'Forever', 'can', 'garner', 'opera', 'wider', 'audience', 'vocals', 'were', 'great', 'solos', 'harmonies', 'vocal', 'blend', 'came', 'together', 'singers', 'had', 'extraordinary', 'stage', 'presence', 'movements', 'were', 'marked', 'grace', 'performed', 'simple', 'choreography', 'singing.The', 'orchestra', 'background', 'dancers', 'looked', 'extremely', 'young', 'complementing', 'youthful', 'late', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'opera', 'band', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'more', 'material', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'interviews', 'more', 'behind-the-concert', 'footage', 'etc.Oh', 'aside', 'David', 'Habbin', 'what', 'hottie', 'eye', 'ear', 'candy', 'female', 'audience', 'Nick', 'Garrett', 'bass', 'baritone', 'could', 'woo', 'woman']",N/A
