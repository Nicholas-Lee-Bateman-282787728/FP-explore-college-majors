I can't believe I finally found this film on DVD.  I had an old VHS tape which was absolutely horrible quality... very grainy.  This version was much better and I could use the Forward/Backwards buttons to skip to my favorite scenes!  I will be watching this DVD for many Holidays to come!!!,5,Christmas is here early!
