I found this movie to be just plain tedious and an absolute bore. Nothing ever really happened. Plain and simple, the character is a sociopath. Hmmm, where we seen this before, snooze. A few times the movie had glimmers of something scarry ( paranormally speaking ) but crash, it leads NO were. About half way through the movie I was so disappointed, no good effects with a crap budget and no real eye catching scenes. I dont understand why other people like this snoozer of a movie.

1538183,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B007UQ8IT2,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","Newlyweds Tim and Molly move in to Molly's childhood home after the death of her parents, but the demons from the past return to haunt her as she spirals back in to drugs and paranoia. LOVELY MOLLY is an exercise in claustrophobic tension and psychological terror from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT director Eduardo S&aacute;nchez. Like Lars von Trier's ANTICHRIST, LOVELY MOLLY is deeply embedded with occult symbolism and paranoid delusion as S&aacute;nchez draws a dizzying veil of madness around his characters. The lines of reality are often blurred and left open to interpretation throughout the film as a result, which can sometimes have a disorienting effect on the viewer. On top of its suffocating mood, LOVELY MOLLY succeeds in creating a number of subtle scares through its spine-tingling sound design, putting the audience on edge without saturating the screen in blood or gore. Gretchen Lodge is as much an asset as she is a liability as Molly. At times, her blatant overacting destroys the illusion, but for every misstep, she counters with an equally-haunting moment of dread. If one thing can be said for certain, however, it is that Lodge has fully committed herself to this role, and she truly believes in the character she is portraying on screen.

Both are unaware of Molly's troubled childhood, which she has repressed, and both are under the belief that she has beaten her drug issues.  But soon after they move in, the alarm goes off in the middle of the night.  Soon after, as Tim is on the road for his job, Molly begins seeing things, and hearing things.  At home.  At work.  She's not alone in the house.  There is something else, from her past, and it won't stop until it has possession of her soul.There are some negative things about LOVELY MOLLY, which kept it from being four stars.  It's derivative in spots; while we can't necessarily expect a film to be truly unique anymore, we still like to see old themes with a fresh twist.  The film drags a bit, too, even by psychological horror standards.  (This isn't a gory slasher flick; if you have a short attention span, look elsewhere.)  The found footage segments are rarely necessary; only a couple really add anything.But there's much about LOVELY MOLLY to recommend.  Truly a great deal, in fact.  The whole premise, while not new, is interesting.  The acting is stellar; lead Gretchen Lodge manages to carry the film mostly by herself.  There is some truly disturbing imagery; at about the ninety minute mark, there's a scene that had me leaning forward in the dark, squinting, just to be sure I was truly seeing this.  One of the single most memorable horror scenes I've come across.  The final seen tingles the spine as well--more so for its implications than anything you actually see.  And that's the thing to truly enjoy about LOVELY MOLLY: it doesn't ever really explain anything.  You have to pay attention.  You have to think.

1538193,ALXY6VD5IUSTK,B007UQ8IT2,Eric Larson,"[3, 5]","Thought I would give my 2 cents since I see there are so many bad reviews. As a veteran horror fan I have seen pretty much everything but I am always on the look out for something new and a little different. While Lovely Molly does not reinvent the Horror wheel it does do something that no other film has done when deeling with Demoinc Possession. It tries to give a more realistic approch to the subject matter. Having read the book ""Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans"" by Malachi Martin I was struck by how Molly's possession follwed some of the stories in that book. It was not the fire and brimstone attacks like The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose (two great films) but was more of a psychological attack. You see we learn in the book that the Demon takes advantage of a person who is under psychological strain and leaves themselves open to demonic attack. Drug use is often involved. Molly suffers mental strain when moving into a house where her father abused her and resorts back to drug use. Opening a window for demonic influence.Now when can explain all of this away with psychology but that is what makes the film so great. We are not sure what is at play here. Is it i her mind or is it really a demon. I feel there are answers to this at the end of the film but one can take either path if they really want to.The film is filled with a feeling of dread. Molly is alone in her struggle and you can feel her sanity/soul slipping away. The preformances by all the actors are top notch. The actress who plays molly, Gretchen Lodge, is really a stand out. This is her first film but one would neve know it as her preformance is fearless and strong.Again like I said this is not your typical Possession film. The Exorcist is still the best and I also love The Exorcism of Emily Rose. I would put both of those films above this one. But I felt Molly was a worthy entry in this genre and was a better film then others dealing with the same subject matter.I would recommend a rental first as this film will not be for everyone (as you can see by the reviews) but some will love it. Personally I watched it on Netflix and then ordered it from here the very next day. I would say it is a very solid 3 1/2 star film. Multiple viewings could help this film go up or down half a point.

1538194,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B007UQ8IT2,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","It's hard to feel sorry for the directors of ""The Blair Witch Project."" They made a movie that launched a whole new genre of filmmaking with their ""found footage"" technique. Since then, the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise has squeezed millions out of the filming style while others followed in hot pursuit to cash in on the craze. There's been ""The Devil Inside,"" ""The Last Exorcism,"" and even ""Chronicle.""The sad thing is now when ""Blair Witch"" director Eduardo Sanchez uses the very cinematography he helped fashion in ""Lovely Molly,"" it comes across as stale and overused. Although it isn't fair to him, his new movie proves lightning doesn't strike the same place twice.Molly and her new husband move into the childhood home she lived in with her mother, father, and sister. Not long after they get settled, Molly starts hearing things and experiencing bizarre happenings. After her truck driving husband leaves, she senses a sinister presence that seems to be her father violently reaching out from the dead. Molly soon finds herself facing the demons of her childhood. The question is, are they ""real"" demons or just metaphorical ones?What makes ""Lovely Molly"" tolerable to watch is the fact that it isn't completely shot in a ""found footage"" style. It switches back and forth, which gets annoying but still saves it from being a complete loss. It is an effectively disturbing little film to a certain degree. Unfortunately, in a day and age where we've already seen possession and Satanic panic revival movies like ""The Rite"" and ""The House of the Devil,"" it just seems redundant and tired.The cast is wonderful and take their individual parts seriously. Gretchen Lodge plays Molly so passionately that she demands your sympathy even when doing something repulsive. Johnny Lewis takes on the role of her husband Tim. He does a convincing job portraying a man caught between wanting to protect his wife and being afraid of her at the same time. Alexandra Holden is Molly's sister, still haunted by her past family life while trying to stay calm and be an anchor for her sister.There's obviously a visual difference between the two styles of cinematography used in the film. The ""found footage"" sections look the way they should. The regular footage is clean and the contrast between the dark colors help bring the film to life. The film is beautifully gloomy and resonates an air of depression. The 5.1 surround sound spreads the creepy groaning, banging, and moody soundtrack all the space it needs to feel like it's surrounding the viewer. It makes for a disturbing experience.The bonus material on the Blu-ray for ""Lovely Molly"" includes a deeper look into the world of ""Lovely Molly. Featurettes include ""Path to madness,"" Haunted past,"" Demonic Forces,"" and ""Is It Real?"" There's also commentary with Director/Co-Writer Eduardo S&aacute;nchez and Co-Writer Jamie Nash. A trailer for the movie is featured as well.I can only imagine how director Sanchez was feeling when he began making ""Lovely Molly."" I'm sure he thought to himself, ""I was part of the filmmakers who made the first groundbreaking 'found footage' movie. I can do it again if I want. I have the right.""

And, sadly, part of the reason I went for this was that it's from the producers of The Lord of the Rings, yet it has none of the feel, not even epic terror. The cover of the case looks creepy, yet the imagery evoked doesn't make it in the film at all, which was dissappointing. The mysteries behind what's going on with Molly have very sparse explaining, and most of what is revealed is simply implied through enivornmental clues, so if you don't like to look at the world around the characters, this film won't make sense to you. Plus, I felt the graphic nudity in this film was uncalled for. If it were organically intertwined into the story, I could understand, but it isn't, nor does any of the nude scenes really make any sense. The language, for the most part, feel like college shout matches, trying to best each other on who could say the worst, which ruined the dialogue also for the most part. Most of the violent scenes, sadly, I was able to predict what would happen and what wouldn't at least a minute before it did/n't. The only part that really did give me chills (aside from the recording camera filming a neighbor family's young daughter and mother) dealt with the only time you do get to see what is afflicting Molly. The way the ""thing"" moved in an unnatural kind of way was the only real reason it did give me the creeps. Otherwise, they should've done better editing with the script, get better camera angles, not use so much extended camera shots (several seemed wasted), and learn from other movies how to make the scares more unpredictable and less bland. In the last shot is really the only other shining spot with a twist ending, but it was too late for me to completely enjoy.Here's to hoping The Awakening, Sinister, and V/H/S will be much better.",2,Nothing like I expected,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1871,"['best', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mix', 'surreal/psychological/supernatural', 'horror', 'sadly', 'part', 'reason', 'went', 'was', 'producers', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'yet', 'none', 'feel', 'not', 'even', 'epic', 'terror', 'cover', 'case', 'creepy', 'yet', 'imagery', 'evoked', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'was', 'dissappointing', 'mysteries', 'what', 'going', 'Molly', 'have', 'very', 'sparse', 'explaining', 'most', 'what', 'revealed', 'simply', 'implied', 'enivornmental', 'clues', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'look', 'world', 'characters', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'felt', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'film', 'was', 'uncalled', 'were', 'organically', 'intertwined', 'story', 'could', 'understand', ""n't"", 'nude', 'scenes', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'language', 'most', 'part', 'feel', 'college', 'shout', 'matches', 'trying', 'best', 'other', 'who', 'could', 'say', 'worst', 'ruined', 'dialogue', 'also', 'most', 'part', 'Most', 'violent', 'scenes', 'sadly', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'least', 'minute', 'did/', ""n't"", 'only', 'part', 'really', 'did', 'give', 'chills', 'aside', 'recording', 'camera', 'filming', 'neighbor', 'family', 'young', 'daughter', 'mother', 'dealt', 'only', 'time', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'afflicting', 'Molly', 'way', 'thing', 'moved', 'unnatural', 'kind', 'way', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'did', 'give', 'creeps', 'Otherwise', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'editing', 'script', 'get', 'better', 'camera', 'angles', 'not', 'use', 'so', 'much', 'extended', 'camera', 'shots', 'several', 'seemed', 'wasted', 'learn', 'other', 'movies', 'how', 'make', 'scares', 'more', 'unpredictable', 'less', 'bland', 'last', 'shot', 'really', 'only', 'other', 'shining', 'spot', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'completely', 'enjoy.Here', 'hoping', 'Awakening', 'Sinister', 'V/H/S', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better']",N/A

Nothing too impressive, but certainly something I would pull out again on a lazy afternoon.  The second time, I was amazed at how the whole thing seemed to fall into place for me.  If anything, I found it more suspenseful and disturbing than I had the first time around.  That's the mark of quality.Huge praise to the actors, particularly Gretchen Lodge who does a fine job as Molly. Alexandra Holden is even better, I think, in the role of Molly's increasingly worried sister.  And Johnny Lewis is excellent as Molly's husband.  Such a sad thing that this likeable actor and talented young man (Johnny, not the character) was unable to counter his own real life demons.One tip: make sure you have the sound turned up - or watch this with headphones on.

Really? Big deal. Name one story that wasn't done in some form by the ancient Greeks or Shakespeare.The question is how well told was the story and I think Lovely Molly is an excellent retelling of ""Am I going insane or is something really going on here?""One trick in pulling off a film like this is having a sympathetic lead characters and Gretchen Lodge did an amazing job portraying a woman who could be someone you know from work or a family friend. Molly is that girl who you don't know very well. She seems nice enough and you heard she had some kind of problem in the past, drugs or something like that. And maybe there's general agreement that the guy she married is a good, stable person and she needed someone like that in her life.Even when Molly starts going off the rails, I found myself feeling sorry for her and hoping she would either pull herself together or get help in time not to go too far.I also thought the supporting characters were solid and well acted.The question throughout the film is ""what's really going on?"" Is it Molly going crazy? Is she possessed? Or some combination of the two?""One of the film's strengths is these questions are never fully answered. From my perspective answering this question wouldn't have made the film any more effective although I think it might have been more satisfying to know if only because I found myself hoping things would somehow work out in the end. There would be some kind of redemption for Molly or her sister.The main thing that detracted from the film for me was the POV camera work. Sometimes POV can work. But this would have been just effective, perhaps more effective without if most of the story had used conventional camera work. POV felt fresh and added atmosphere in Blaire Witch.

1538201,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B007UQ8IT2,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 2]","Lovely Molly is labeled a horror movie, although I personally believe it's a psychological drama with horror elements. The story follows newlywed Molly as she moves into her old home and is haunted by her past. What begins as a supernatural horror, eventually reveals itself to be a psychological drama/horror.First, as I previously stated, this film doesn't feel like a pure-breed horror film; although it does have some tension and jump-out scares throughout, most of the film focuses on the battle within Molly's mind and her battle with drugs and her past. Gretchen Lodge plays Molly great as a disturbing and chilling character. I wasn't at the edge of my seat or scared most of the time, but her performance as Molly and her actions were often disturbing. The drama and horror, although slightly limited, compliment each other well in this movie. The music was okay, I liked some of it and disliked some of it. One major problem I found was that this movie is more illogical than your average film. Many of her actions are, to be blunt, crazy. She stalks people, she is caught on camera being ""raped"" by nothing by her boss, she hallucinates, and she's assaults/batters her husband (she does a lot more than this, though)... But she's only given sleeping pills and she's never taken to get help.  I can understand taking care of your family, but they mention something about not knowing what Molly went through in her last visit to a hospital and they never fully explain it. Also, the ending was a bit on the unfulfilling side, and also a little confusing.Overall, Lovely Molly is a decent psychological drama/horror. It's not a supernatural horror as some of you may expect because of the trailers and description, so you should know what you're getting into. As of 10/6/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.Lovely Molly has strong violence and blood, a graphic sex scene and full nudity (Molly is nude throughout the end of the film.",3,More of a Psychological Drama with horror elements...

A few pretty nice ideas thrown around here and there but they ultimately build to nothing.I hated this movie. When are filmmakers going to realize that you cannot get away with setting up a really solid atmosphere and then...nothing? You can't make a quality movie without a good script. Hell, in this case, without a good story.It was pretty decent to start. The beginning was fine. EXTREMELY creepy to begin with. The atmosphere, the sounds, the music...all SO effective. I began watching it in the middle of the night and had to shut it off...to be perfectly honest. When I finally finished it, I was left very confused because the movie has no idea what it wants to be. Is it a found footage film? Is it a paranormal film? Is it a psychological horror? Trying to cram all 3 of those into one without much of a story line is just not a great idea. The big problem is that the movie isn't very clear on what's happening. I had to google for explanations and I came to realize that it revolves a lot around the occult and symbolism. Besides seeing one symbol near the beginning...you could have fooled me because I did NOT get that at all. I have no idea what was haunting her or what she was possessed by...was it her father? Was it the demon with the horse head...that, apparently, I should have seen at the end of the movie but all I saw was darkness? There was really very little explanation to anything...was her dad summoning a demon? WAS the demon her dad? Was it all in her head? What the hell was going on?? And the ending was HORRIBLE. I also keep seeing people talk about the amazing performance from Gretchen Lodge. It was not that great. Meryl Streep that girl is not. What is it? Is it because she got naked a lot? Or dirty? She got dirty and looked like crap a lot. She isn't afraid to get ugly, which is great. But she really shouldn't open her mouth very much. Very mediocre performance, if that. Bad acting all around, really.From the guys who did The Blair Witch Project...one of the most overrated films ever. The only reason it was so big is simply because it was the first found footage movie and people just HAD to see it. I was never and am still not a fan of it.I'm all for symbolism but you have to give even the slightest explanation as to what's going on and what things may mean. I should not have to google a movie to find out what I just watched. There is a reason this movie didn't get a theatrical release...or at least not a wide one. It's bad.

The horse is haunting her? Some demon looking thing that looks like a moth is haunting her? She went crazy? See, these were all good plotlines, I dont see why the director couldnt choose one to go with.Second, there was a very decent couple of scenes in this movie. (The vicious make-out and the grisly end of the cheating piece of crap.)third, the ending was very confusing. The sister goes back into the house and sees what's in the closet, reaching out for it much like Molly. Does that hint at a ""Lovely Hannah"".

1538210,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007UQ8IT2,Mark Turner,"[6, 10]","It seems that horror films have decided the best way to scare people these days is lost footage or home made movie styles of making films. Yes, these can offer some truly frightening moments but it doesn't always work. Those behind LOVELY MOLLY have decided to combine that format with straight forward narrative story telling and it works but not quite.Molly and Tim are a young couple just married as the film opens. Their wedding runs smoothly and we get to watch the handheld camera work as their wedding is filmed and as they enter their new home, actually Molly's old one. The house they move into was the one that belonged to her parents years ago and now the young couple is taking it over.Things begin to go wonky early on as one night the alarm system Tim had installed goes off saying someone entered the kitchen. The police show and find no one or any sign of a break in. While Tim thanks them and says he must not have locked the door, he is certain that he did so.Tim had the system installed because as a truck driver he knows he'll be gone days at a time and wanted Molly to be safe. But odd things begin to happen that a simple lock and alarm system won't prevent. Molly continues to go to work the days Tim is on the road, but when home she feels a sense of uneasiness.The times when Tim is home are filled with odd behavior by Molly. It's enough odd behavior that Tim begins to question whether Molly has begun using drugs again. Apparently Molly had a severe addiction problem that stemmed from something in her past, something that involved her father in this very house.As these events unfold the viewer begins to wonder if there is something truly demonic going on in the house or is Molly losing her mind? When it's revealed that Molly had some mental issues years before, that line of thought begins to dominate and we watch as we think that Molly is slowly drifting into madness.As was the case with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a film that I didn't find frightening until the final images, LOVELY MOLLY does the same thing giving us a terrifying answer to the things that happen here with the last shot. Until that shot I felt no sense of fear or terror and found the movie to actually move along at a snails pace revealing little. But something else did and perhaps would have made all the difference had I chosen to view those instead.The Special Features of this disc include several pieces put together revealing more of the back story to the tale being told as if it were webisodes that explained and set up so much more. The history of the house is one. The problems that faced Molly's family when she was a child is another. Had these been incorporated into the final film it would have been a much scarier film to watch and explained enough that the actions of the characters would have made more sense.As it stands the film moves along slowly and you find yourself wondering more along the lines of what is going on than having some knowledge to base the actions of anyone on. Those clues would have made all the difference. So if you plan to watch this movie, watch those short episodes first, then watch the film. It will be scarier if you do so since they are more terrifying than the movie all by itself.",2,NOT SO SCARY,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,3240,"['horror', 'films', 'have', 'decided', 'best', 'way', 'scare', 'people', 'days', 'lost', 'footage', 'home', 'made', 'movie', 'styles', 'making', 'films', 'Yes', 'can', 'offer', 'truly', 'frightening', 'moments', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'LOVELY', 'MOLLY', 'have', 'decided', 'combine', 'format', 'straight', 'forward', 'narrative', 'story', 'telling', 'not', 'quite.Molly', 'Tim', 'are', 'young', 'couple', 'just', 'married', 'film', 'wedding', 'smoothly', 'get', 'watch', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'wedding', 'filmed', 'enter', 'new', 'home', 'actually', 'Molly', 'old', 'one', 'house', 'move', 'was', 'one', 'belonged', 'parents', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'young', 'couple', 'taking', 'begin', 'go', 'wonky', 'early', 'one', 'night', 'alarm', 'system', 'Tim', 'had', 'installed', 'saying', 'someone', 'entered', 'kitchen', 'police', 'show', 'find', 'one', 'sign', 'break', 'Tim', 'thanks', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'locked', 'door', 'certain', 'did', 'so.Tim', 'had', 'system', 'installed', 'because', 'truck', 'driver', ""'ll"", 'be', 'gone', 'days', 'time', 'wanted', 'Molly', 'be', 'safe', 'odd', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'simple', 'lock', 'alarm', 'system', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'Molly', 'go', 'work', 'days', 'Tim', 'road', 'when', 'home', 'sense', 'uneasiness.The', 'times', 'when', 'Tim', 'home', 'are', 'filled', 'odd', 'behavior', 'Molly', 'enough', 'odd', 'behavior', 'Tim', 'question', 'Molly', 'begun', 'using', 'drugs', 'again', 'Apparently', 'Molly', 'had', 'severe', 'addiction', 'problem', 'stemmed', 'something', 'past', 'something', 'involved', 'father', 'very', 'house.As', 'events', 'unfold', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'something', 'truly', 'demonic', 'going', 'house', 'Molly', 'losing', 'mind', 'When', 'revealed', 'Molly', 'had', 'mental', 'issues', 'years', 'before', 'line', 'thought', 'begins', 'dominate', 'watch', 'think', 'Molly', 'slowly', 'drifting', 'madness.As', 'was', 'case', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'frightening', 'final', 'images', 'LOVELY', 'MOLLY', 'same', 'thing', 'giving', 'terrifying', 'answer', 'things', 'happen', 'here', 'last', 'shot', 'shot', 'felt', 'sense', 'fear', 'terror', 'found', 'movie', 'actually', 'move', 'along', 'snails', 'pace', 'revealing', 'little', 'something', 'else', 'did', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'had', 'chosen', 'view', 'instead.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'disc', 'include', 'several', 'pieces', 'put', 'together', 'revealing', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'were', 'webisodes', 'explained', 'set', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'history', 'house', 'one', 'problems', 'faced', 'Molly', 'family', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Had', 'been', 'incorporated', 'final', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'scarier', 'film', 'watch', 'explained', 'enough', 'actions', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense.As', 'film', 'moves', 'slowly', 'find', 'wondering', 'more', 'lines', 'what', 'going', 'having', 'knowledge', 'base', 'actions', 'anyone', 'clues', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'So', 'plan', 'watch', 'movie', 'watch', 'short', 'episodes', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'scarier', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'more', 'terrifying', 'movie']",N/A

The movie made no sense and when I saw this was created by the same guy who did Blair Witch I understand because that movie was a pile of confusing garbage as well. This part might contain spoilers but I don't think it's possible to spoil a movie that doesn't make any sense.A woman with an abusive childhood,drug addiction,and psychological issues think she is being raped by her dead father,then she has this obsession with recording the family down the street on video, then she starts using drugs again and becomes more violent killing the preacher she seduced, her husband and threatening to kill her sisters son. Oh she also finds a dead dear and hides it in the basement ceiling and goes to stab its dead body for some odd reason. Then at the end of the movie it makes even less sense when we see Molly embraced by a demon and then her sister staring at an empty closet and then the ""spookie"" sound comes on and the movie goes to black. Don't even try to make sense of what never did. A psychotic has visions and goes on a killing spree and then kills the daughter of the woman her husband is cheating with. That's all that's clear but the husband s story of living a double life doesn't even make any sense. NOTHING! makes sense in this garbage.The movie makes no sense, the plot makes no sense, it's long, it carries on slow, it's terribly boring, there is no moment of suspense just moments when you try to figure out what you're watching. This is one of the worst films I've sat down and watched. Although I don't feel too bad because I had to break the movie down and watch it throughout a weekend. The movie is so slow it's not even engaging. It doesn't leave you guessing or trying to figure out what's going on...it just has you checking the play clock wondering how much longer the movie is. The entire time you watch this as Molly's behavior gets stranger and stranger you keep asking ""when are these people going to call the loony bin to pick her up?"". You'll yell and scream at the characters. ""She's nuts! Get her some help!"" meanwhile the movie just drags on and like any mentally ill person that's a danger, she goes off assaulting and killing people. These aren't murders like Jason Vorhees or some slasher film, no these are boring pretentious film murders. They're murders that don't answer any questions or explain anything. I'd honestly love to give this director a thumbs up and say bravo for trying but Eduardo Sanchez DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE! The guy couldn't create an actual story with a plot to save his life. This movie is monotone, the actors are good and they belong in a movie with a real writer. Not some guy who's famous for making shaky cam films. ""Shaky"" as in I need this visual effect to divert your attention from realizing there is no point to this story.When viewers have so many questions about a movie it means you failed as a writer. All you hear in reviews about this movie are What is this? What was that? Why did she do that? What was that thing? and there is no answer. This movie is one long pointless journey that ends on a pointless note. The problem is you won't even care much about what's going on in the movie because the plot never moves. There is never any suspense. It's dull all the way through. An invisible ghost? That Blair Witch junk died in the late 90's.

This LOVELY MOLLY is a gritty and grisly horror flick that is just as chilling as it is disturbing.  Full of frightening scenes and suspense, this movie will give you an entertaining evening of horror.I have to preface the rest of this review by stating this film is not perfect and does have a couple of flaws.  But if you can overlook them, you're in for a real treat.  LOVELY MOLLY is a treat for fans of well made, low-budget horror.The film is shot pretty well, although I couldn't tell if the filmmakers were trying for a found-footage look, or if the camera was simply shaky at times.  This doesn't detract much from the film itself, though.  In certain scenes, the shakiness even adds to the suspense.LOVELY MOLLY has some truly gruesome scenes as well, which really work well to intensify the situations in the film.  In one scene, Molly is kissing her husband when she suddenly clamps down on his lips with her teeth...and doesn't let go.  Her husband struggles to free himself, but Molly has a lock on him that he can't break.  As a result, both of his lips are almost torn off.  This is just one of several grisly scenes that you can enjoy within the movie.A couple of things in the film did not make sense to me.  For example, the specific things that Molly's father did to her as a child were never revealed...so we don't really no exactly how big of a bastard the man was.  Also, there's no real sense of who or what is doing the haunting.  We suspect it's her dead, but we're never really told for sure.But those things aside, LOVELY MOLLY is a fun and terrifying ride that you should check out.

I wasn't expecting much because of the over-all three star rating by the combined reviews I have read here on amazon. I am glad to report that the majority seem to not know what a solid horror film experience truly is. Well be assured, this is it. This movie keeps you guessing as to what is realy going on, but this is a good thing. If you are willing to leave your expectations at the door this movie should pleasantly suprise you. The movie is truly a real gem of the genre because of the very reason that it keeps you guessing. Is the main character truly possessed, or is she simply the victim of mental illness? The audience never quite finds out in the end. But what we do have here is spellbinding tension that never let's up. Most of the fun is trying to figure out if this girl is truly posesssed or if she is simply very mentally ill. The fact that the question is never really answered is the real gift of this movie. Trying to understand the unknown is what keeps you hooked on this film. In the mean time we have some very solid acting and incredible tension that never let's up. And some unforgettable chilling moments that should leave you breathless if you give it a chance. I am  venturing to guess that persons who did not like this movie were expecting the film to go in the predictable directions, but it never really does. This movie is creepy, well directed and simply astonishing in it's decision to not sell out for cheep thrills or gore.

The movie switches between showing us the view from a camcorder and the regular movie view, which really does nothing for the people watching the movie but get annoyed.

S&aacute;nchez' follow-up flicks have proven less interesting than his debut, but Lovely Molly--while being a workmanlike film from a technical level--at least shows that S&aacute;nchez has regained some of that eye for subtle detail that made Blair Witch, love it or hate it, an unforgettable experience.Lovely Molly is basically S&aacute;nchez' update of Franklin Schaffner's 1980 creep-classic The Entity (with one wonderful, if eminently frustrating, grace note of John Carpenter's over-the-top Satanic Panic cheesefest Prince of Darkness; you'll instantly know it when you see it), though S&aacute;nchez and co-writer Jamie Nash, who's been partnering S&aacute;nchez since 2006's Altered, add in the question of whether Molly (Gretchen Lodge in her feature debut) is actually being haunted, or whether she's just nuts. (More on this later.) Molly, it turns out, has a rather dark background, but, in one of those classic stupid-people-making-stupid-decisions horror movie quirks, decides to move back into the abandoned family homestead with new hubby Tim (the late Johnny Lewis, best known for Sons of Anarchy), a long-distance truck driver who's away a lot. Thus Molly, in recovery from a nasty heroin habit and a spell in the local loony bin, leans on her sister Hannah (How to Deal's Alexandra Holden) for support. But ""support"" from the human world might not cut it--it looks as if the creature that haunted her after her mother's death may be back, and with bells on. But here's the question--is Molly actually being haunted, or has she always just had, shall we say, a casual relationship with reality?It's not a bad question to ask, save two problems that keep rearing their ugly heads: 1. by positing that the haunting may in fact be in the mind of the main character, the writers made the movie more standard than it would otherwise have been; in fact, one of the things that made The Entity so surprising is that, aside from the professional skeptics in the film, pretty much everyone was onboard from day one with the fact that Barbara Hershey was being repeatedly raped by a ghost, and 2. the writers didn't do much of anything to disguise the fact that, despite inserting some very clever (if obvious) red herrings to point to the other conclusion, they know the answer, and they're all too eager to share it with you. (Just in case you don't get it, they throw in a completely gratuitous--but eerily effective, in a delayed-reaction kind of way--coda to the film that removes most of the ambiguity. But not quite all of it.)However, and with the understanding that I'm going to still be rating this movie as ""just slightly above average"", the bottom line is that despite its problems, it's brutally effective. This is partially a result of its subject matter--supernatural-entity-rape is kind of a shortcut straight into ""disturbing"" in lizard-brain. But it also has to do with Gretchen Lodge's performance, which is just as distressing as Barbara Hershey's thirty-two years ago. She pulls this off, and she pulls it off well. There's more to it than that, of course; S&aacute;nchez pulls out all the ""get the audience to identify with the main character"" stops here, from making the family blue-collar-on-the-verge-of-poverty (Molly herself is a janitor at a big-box store) to casting an attractive-but-unconventionally-so actress (as good an actress as she may be, I can't imagine someone as conventionally glamorous as, say, Emma Stone pulling this off, because you will not be able to get past the fact that you're watching Emma Stone). And while I can't get into it without going into major spoiler territory, one of the movie's most effective disturbing scenes is entirely non-paranormal, and that's entirely down to Lodge's acting. While the movie starts off slow, and it overplays its hand more often than not, if you're in the mood for something that's more creepy than slasher-flick-y, turn out the lights and dial this one up.

Had I know it was from the same group as the ""Blair Witch Project"" I would never have wasted my time.  If you enjoy movies filmed on shaky hand held cameras, with poor dialogue, very few actors, crappy sets and ghosts that look like a guy wearing a paper mache horses head and a cape (seen from 50 feet away in the dark) and a dirty naked woman shooting up,  then this movie might be for you.I learned a long time ago, that if a movie does not get better, begin to make some sense, gets my interest or be pretty funny within the first 20 to 30 minutes, then it doesn't get  better or make sense at the end. I wish I'd remember this before I watched the entire movie. Basic plot is sexually abusive dad who's ghost returns (with a horses head) to drive his drug addicted daughter to go crazy and commit murder and then makes the same moves on his older sister.The entire action revolves around watching this woman lose her mind while hearing thumping sounds from the basement and front door.  Every so often when that gets boring she gets stoned, takes off her clothes, shoots up, bites her husband or tries to seduce her minister. All of this takes place in two locations, one of which looks like a quickie mart and the other a very old house in the country. Wow!I want to be sure I don't forget to tell what a let down the ending is.  I haven't seen so little of the monster (or the ghost in this case) since movies from the 50's, you know the ones, where you don't see the creature until the last five minutes of the movie, and then you can barely make out what it looks like because the room is so dark. (But wait, didn't they do that in the ""Blair Witch Project"" too?) Seeing a guy dressed in a cape with a paper mache horses head at fifty feet in the dark for a few seconds at the end of the film was the last straw.Several reviewers said they wish they had included the ""extras"" in the film because then the movie would make more sense. I think what happened is the producers must have shown the movie to friends and they didn't have a clue what is was about. Since they had already spent their budget and let the actors go, they filmed some shorts with ""talk overs"" to try to cover them selves.At any rate, I consider this movie a TOTAL WASTE of time.

Tim (Johnny Lewis) and Molly (Gretchen Lodge) get married in 2010 according to the camera, but don't move into her parent's home until a year later in 2011. We know that her parents, Ben and Tammy are deceased...in heaven watching the ceremony.Tim is a truck driver who travels. He has installed an alarm system, one that goes off on occasion as if someone inside the house unlocks and opens the door. But they seemingly own no gun living in a rural area. Hannah (Alexandra Holden) is Molly's F-bomb dropping, pot smoking, blond sister. There is a mystery concerning the house and its past that Molly doesn't recall. She is creeped out by being alone in her childhood house. All this adds up to only one thing to horror genre fans who have seen this recently in too many films. However this film doesn't care if you gather this clue early as there is much more going on.To add to the uncertainty, Molly has a history of drug use and at times doesn't seem to be all there. Interesting film, although clearly not for everyone. This is a slightly more complex ""ghost"" story than the Paranormal series and fans of the simple hand held camera genre may not find this feature enjoyable.
