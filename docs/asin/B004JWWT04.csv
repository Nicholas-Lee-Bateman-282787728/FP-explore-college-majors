1411677,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,B004JWWT04,avoraciousreader,"[40, 54]","Student Servicesdir Emmanuelle Bercot 2010Oddly affectless story  3*If I had been led to this film by the included trailer, I might have been tempted to sue for false advertising.  The trailer makes it sound like a sprightly French sex comedy -- ""I got,"" the arch voiceover declares, "" ... creative.  The money is great, the work is stimulating.  Now, I'm making pleasure my business, and putting my studies on hold.""  Tre bien! Such fun!In reality (even ignoring that she did not, in point of fact, put her studies on hold but pursued them doggedly), given the topic (schoolgirl prostitution), the scandalous real-life memoir on which it was based (""Mes chere etudes"" or ""My expensive education"" by ""Laura D.""), and the abundant nudity and sexual situations, this film is dreary and surprisingly bland, as reflected in its muted, dingy tones.Laura (Deborah Francois) is a university language student in an unspecified city (not Paris -- she eventually moves to Paris), barely squeaking by when her boyfriend/roommate Manu insists that she start sharing the rent.  She responds to an online ad by Joe (Alain Cauchi), a persuasive fifty-something gym teacher, seeking companionship, and thus begins her career as occasional, part time, self-employed call girl.  She leaves Manu and takes up with the dreamy but drifting Benjamin (Mathieu Demy), connects with another (or a few, this networking could have had more screen time) student prostitute, and enjoys the fruits of her new found solvency (new jeans and jacket, dinners out).  After a series of escalating encounters with Joe, increasingly disturbing but with temptingly increasing fees, Laura flees to Paris, where she studies for her exams while working in a restaurant.  The film is sandwiched within Laura's heavily disguised TV appearance as a book author.Deborah Francois as Laura is rather ordinarily pretty (hardly ""stunning"" per the jacket copy), a typical young, healthy college girl.but largely affectless, sullen,  and awkward and shy -- or alternately, just bored -- with the clients.  She seems to find little ""stimulating"" except the money she receives, or the new computer Joe gives her.  The character Laura just seems generally uninteresting, a mopey, withdrawn adolescent.  I also find it odd that she doesn't even pretend to any interest or pleasure with the johns -- isn't that supposed to be part of the deal?  Well, they are mostly too engrossed in their own fantasies to notice.Far more interesting, indeed, are those johns, in particular the earnestly manipulative Joe.  Cauchi, and the other actors who portrayed them, deserve credit for playing such exposed roles.The film does have its aspects of interest.  The relation with Joe -- and that with boy toy Benjamin -- has some nuance.  Whether or not it depicts a widespread social problem is the actual scandal surrounding the original memoir.  Not a bad film, but on the whole, it just doesn't click for me, or only on a sort of 'eh' level.  A little too didactic, and the character of Laura did not particularly engage my interest or sympathy (a bit more back story might have helped).  Even the tension of the situation with Joe does not really grab me (how many times can you shout ""Don't go down into the basement""?)  So I'll go with 3*'s on this one.",3,Oddly affectless story,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,3289,"['Student', 'Servicesdir', 'Emmanuelle', 'Bercot', '2010Oddly', 'affectless', 'story', '3*If', 'had', 'been', 'led', 'film', 'included', 'trailer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'sue', 'false', 'advertising', 'trailer', 'sprightly', 'French', 'sex', 'comedy', 'got', 'arch', 'voiceover', 'creative', 'money', 'great', 'work', 'stimulating', 'Now', ""'m"", 'making', 'pleasure', 'business', 'putting', 'studies', 'hold', 'Tre', 'bien', 'Such', 'fun', 'reality', 'even', 'ignoring', 'did', 'not', 'point', 'fact', 'put', 'studies', 'hold', 'pursued', 'doggedly', 'given', 'topic', 'schoolgirl', 'prostitution', 'scandalous', 'real-life', 'memoir', 'was', 'based', 'Mes', 'chere', 'expensive', 'education', 'Laura', 'D.', 'abundant', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'film', 'dreary', 'surprisingly', 'bland', 'reflected', 'muted', 'dingy', 'tones.Laura', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'university', 'language', 'student', 'unspecified', 'city', 'not', 'Paris', 'eventually', 'Paris', 'barely', 'squeaking', 'when', 'boyfriend/roommate', 'Manu', 'start', 'sharing', 'rent', 'online', 'ad', 'Joe', 'Alain', 'Cauchi', 'persuasive', 'fifty-something', 'gym', 'teacher', 'seeking', 'companionship', 'thus', 'career', 'occasional', 'part', 'time', 'self-employed', 'call', 'girl', 'Manu', 'up', 'dreamy', 'drifting', 'Benjamin', 'Mathieu', 'Demy', 'few', 'networking', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'student', 'prostitute', 'fruits', 'new', 'found', 'solvency', 'new', 'jeans', 'jacket', 'dinners', 'out', 'series', 'escalating', 'encounters', 'Joe', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'temptingly', 'increasing', 'fees', 'Laura', 'Paris', 'where', 'studies', 'exams', 'working', 'restaurant', 'film', 'sandwiched', 'Laura', 'heavily', 'disguised', 'TV', 'appearance', 'book', 'author.Deborah', 'Francois', 'Laura', 'rather', 'ordinarily', 'pretty', 'hardly', 'stunning', 'jacket', 'copy', 'typical', 'young', 'healthy', 'college', 'girl.but', 'largely', 'affectless', 'sullen', 'awkward', 'shy', 'alternately', 'just', 'bored', 'clients', 'find', 'little', 'stimulating', 'money', 'new', 'computer', 'Joe', 'character', 'Laura', 'just', 'generally', 'uninteresting', 'mopey', 'withdrawn', 'adolescent', 'also', 'find', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'interest', 'pleasure', 'johns', ""n't"", 'that', 'supposed', 'be', 'part', 'deal', 'Well', 'are', 'mostly', 'too', 'engrossed', 'own', 'fantasies', 'notice.Far', 'more', 'interesting', 'indeed', 'are', 'johns', 'particular', 'earnestly', 'manipulative', 'Joe', 'Cauchi', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'deserve', 'credit', 'playing', 'such', 'exposed', 'roles.The', 'film', 'have', 'aspects', 'interest', 'relation', 'Joe', 'boy', 'toy', 'Benjamin', 'nuance', 'not', 'widespread', 'social', 'problem', 'actual', 'scandal', 'surrounding', 'original', 'memoir', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'whole', 'just', ""n't"", 'click', 'only', 'sort', ""'eh"", 'level', 'little', 'too', 'didactic', 'character', 'Laura', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'engage', 'interest', 'sympathy', 'bit', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'Even', 'tension', 'situation', 'Joe', 'not', 'really', 'grab', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'shout', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'basement', ""'ll"", 'go', '3*', 'one']",N/A

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[48, 55]","Deborah Francois portrays your run-of-the-mill college student;  intelligent, focused, dedicated to her boyfriend and wanting to experience the whole college scene.  Unfortunately, she shares another attribute of so many college students these days:  she's flat broke and is unable to pay all her bills.To make ends meet, she turns to the world's oldest profession.  The $$ is good (although a few times she gets gyped) and she not only makes enough to get her bills paid but she can even splurge a little bit and buy some fancy clothes that had always been well beyond her means.On the downside, she is exposed to violence and the ordeal wrecks the relationships she has with the men she's dating.  She's also degraded and starts to struggle to keep up with her classwork.  It is, in short, something of a Faustian pact that she makes when she decides to moonlight as a courtesan.Unlike 20yrs ago, most prostitutes of today are not streetwalkers (except for the poorest of them).  Rather, they use the Internet to find their clients ~ and vice versa.  It is something of a daunting process as the young girls never know who is on the other side of the Instant Message or e-mail.Deborah Francois is not a supermodel, but she's very pretty.  In other words, she is perfect for this part as she's just your average run-of-the-mill attractive college student who is trying to make ends meet.  Unfortunately, young women play this dangerous game across the world at an epidemic rate these days, even at highbrow institutions such as Columbia University.  It's certainly not just something that is a French / European problem.  The story reflected in this movie is supposedly based on fact and it's an all too common issue that society needs to address.There are some who complain about how the aging & out-of-shape men who portray her clients in this film are an eyesore.  To this, I would say that these viewers are missing the point.  To be sure, European movies tend to be much more graphic than American films as the former do not have to deal with the FCC.  {As a sidenote, Europeans scoff at Americans for making such a huge deal out of Janet Jackson's nipplegate @ the Superbowl}.  Ultimately, this is NOT another re-do ofPretty Womanwhere a prostitute hooks up with a guy who looks like Richard Gere and lives happily ever after.  No, this is what REALLY happens each & every day.

At the end ofthe movie text proclaims that as many as 40,000 young women in France each year pursuethis route, to some degree, to get by.Yes, Deborah Francois seemed a suitable actress for this part.  She is good-looking thoughnot stunningly beautiful.  She is well-proportioned in the nude as well.  The men also seemwell suited for their roles.This movie is now available on DVD through IFC Films, a major independent film distributor.Though all the dialog is in French, the English subtitles are done well for those like myselfwho cannot understand French.I found the character annoying at times (another touch of realism) as she tells herself forexample, &#34;I am not a whore; I am not a whore&#34;, while proceeding to more or less live thelife of one, or submitting to sexual acts with expressions of disgust, revulsion and hatredon her face.  And she starts out just looking for enough money to pay rent, buy food andtextbooks, but soon begins lusting after expensive clothes, a new laptop and what-not.The movie gives a brief glimpse of the varied situations young women can end up in:mistresses who run escort services, trying to juggle a boyfriend and being a sex worker,live-in situations in which occasional sexual acts serve as the rent; men who want sexualfetishes indulged.  The movie is reasonably discreet as you do not see sex acts in progress(not full-body view anyhow); the most the viewer sees is the actress's body in the nude,and there is not a lot of violence (only enough to hint at the dangers involved).

1411688,A2LFWRKGPW5PU0,B004JWWT04,"Ramm ""DVD-OCD""","[4, 4]","I generally enjoyed this film - based on the 'true/shocking' revelations of a  (French) female university student who turned to the world's oldest profession to help finance her way thru school.  It is, perhaps, the 'expose' angle of the movie that slants the general tenor of the piece towards a negative vibe - as the viewer is introduced to the story's lead character, Laura, and follows her down a path of personal denigration as she barters her youthful body for some spending cash & millennial trinkets.The 'shock value' of the source book from which the screenplay was derived is based on the (purported) 'epidemic' levels of prostitution engaged in by female college students to make ends meet - so it is not surprising that the director has seemingly gone out of their way to make sure that the sexual 'pay for play' activities of the film's star are not made to look 'enjoyable'.  In this, at least, they have managed to succeed!The lead actress, Deborah Francois, IS lovely - in just the right way to provide a vulnerable heroine for the sordid tale... and she sure doesn't appear to like what she's doing in the sexual realm - so much so - that after a while I found the plot to become rather disingenuous and dis-engaging.  Despite many scenes where Ms Francois fully reveals her attractive body and participates in sexual congress with a variety of sorta 'flawed' male individuals - there is nothing arousing about any of it.  Could the girl be any more 'bored' & repulsed?!  It really makes one wonder why her one repeat customer 'Joe' keeps coming back for more... or why SHE sticks it out for as long as she does.Without treading into the politically/morally dicey territory surrounding the whole issue of prostitution - I felt that this film presents a sort of mono-dimensional and moralistic take on the situation.  Some reviewers compare 'Student Services' to the likes of ""Pretty Woman"" and extol its' virtues for presenting a more 'realistic' portrayal of the disagreeable aspects of prostitution - personally I might suggest that a more relevant comparison could be to the cable TV series ""Secret Diary of A Call Girl"" based on the 'true' adventures of London escort (AND student!) 'Belle de Jour'.  'Belle' also exhibits a 'conflicted' character in trying to reconcile the two sides of her life in the face of society's general disdain for sex workers - but she, at least, takes 'some' pleasure in her craft, and on occasion even finds her sexual skills to be of 'service' in helping individuals overcome personal problems.  Admittedly, the 'clients' that Laura encounters in ""Student Services"" are portrayed as a particularly loutish lot - but 'where's the love'?!  Ultimately I began to sympathize w/ her self loathing and sorta lost interest in the 'story' - such as it was.  There are obviously 'bigger issues' of youth poverty and socioeconomic inequality at play - but none of them get meaningfully addressed/answered in this film.

The movie is based on the highly controversial autobiography of a French college student published in 2008. In it, ""Laura"" describes how a desperate financial situation led her into the world of prostitution. While her story is sensational, the controversy has more to do with her claim that thousands of other French coeds are doing essentially the same thing, a number that is mostly dismissed by the public and press but actually supported by the French police. As for the movie, it's a fairly familiar story of a good girl forced by circumstances into going ""bad,"" but it is well done nonetheless (since I don't understand French I may have missed a nuance here and there). The lead actress, Deborah Francois, is gorgeous but sufficiently ""real"" enough to be believable.  For those who are interested, she spends a good bit of the movie in various states of undress and looks quite comely and suitably embarassed while doing it.  Be advised, there is one scene of sexual violence that may disturb some viewers.",3,"Familiar story, very cute girl",1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,1110,"['review', 'based', 'French', 'DVD', 'release', 'title', 'ch', 'egrave', 'res', 'eacute', 'tudes', 'movie', 'based', 'highly', 'controversial', 'autobiography', 'French', 'college', 'student', 'published', '2008', 'Laura', 'how', 'desperate', 'financial', 'situation', 'led', 'world', 'prostitution', 'story', 'sensational', 'controversy', 'more', 'do', 'claim', 'thousands', 'other', 'French', 'coeds', 'are', 'doing', 'essentially', 'same', 'thing', 'number', 'mostly', 'dismissed', 'public', 'press', 'actually', 'supported', 'French', 'police', 'movie', 'fairly', 'familiar', 'story', 'good', 'girl', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'going', 'bad', 'well', 'done', 'nonetheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'French', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'nuance', 'here', 'there', 'lead', 'actress', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'gorgeous', 'sufficiently', 'real', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'good', 'bit', 'movie', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'quite', 'comely', 'suitably', 'embarassed', 'doing', 'Be', 'advised', 'one', 'scene', 'sexual', 'violence', 'may', 'disturb', 'viewers']",N/A
