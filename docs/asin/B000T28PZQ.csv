1088370,A1A692B4XLFOLL,B000T28PZQ,"A. Courie ""Treb""","[37, 38]","Drew Carey hosts the hilarious ""Whose Line is it Anyway"" (adapted from a British show of the same name).  In this show, four actor/comedians (usually Colin Mochrie, Wayne Brady, Ryan Stiles, and a ""wildcard"") act out improvisational comedy skits.These skits are hilarious!  My wife and I will sometimes be in tears laughing at these incredibly skilled actors who can do amazing improvisational comedy.  They also have a great rapport with each other, which is probably the key to the show.That being said, the first season doesn't quite live up to the later seasons.  Some of the skits (""games"") were a bit lame and not that funny - it's as if the writers were still searching for the best ideas for the show.  And don't get excited about the ""Uncensored"" label, because little if anything in this season was actually censored, so you won't see anything that you haven't already seen.Still, it's a side-splittingly funny show with a fabulous cast and should be must-buy for anyone.",4,Great Show - But the First Season isn't as Good as the Later Seasons,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,981,"['Drew', 'Carey', 'hilarious', 'Whose', 'Line', 'Anyway', 'adapted', 'British', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'show', 'four', 'actor/comedians', 'usually', 'Colin', 'Mochrie', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'Ryan', 'Stiles', 'wildcard', 'act', 'improvisational', 'comedy', 'skits.These', 'skits', 'are', 'hilarious', 'wife', 'will', 'sometimes', 'be', 'tears', 'laughing', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'amazing', 'improvisational', 'comedy', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'rapport', 'other', 'probably', 'key', 'show.That', 'being', 'said', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'later', 'seasons', 'skits', 'games', 'were', 'bit', 'lame', 'not', 'funny', 'writers', 'were', 'still', 'searching', 'best', 'ideas', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'Uncensored', 'label', 'because', 'little', 'anything', 'season', 'was', 'actually', 'censored', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen.Still', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', 'show', 'fabulous', 'cast', 'should', 'be', 'must-buy', 'anyone']",N/A

Whether or not your skeptical about the reality of this show, it still remains that it is hilarious to watch and the truth of the matter is that everyone on this show is well-versed in improv. I've never cared for Drew Carey on the show, but everyone else really shines (even a young Stephen Colbert!)The DVD bonus features are limited to outtakes but watching some of those are even funnier that the show itself! (Ryan Stiles making fun of the producer behind his back is absolutely hysterical!) If you even remotely liked the show this collection is well-worth a look.

The ""Uncensored"" label is misleading though. Only the special features are really uncensored, and even with those, about 25% are things the censors were just being overly politically correct with. You could tell the talent wasn't very happy with the censors at times and I don't blame them. I think most of the ""uncensored"" stuff are things that would be aired normally on a channel like Comedy Central, but since the show was basically owned by Disney at the time, they considered very mild things as controversial.Anyway, I highly recommend this to any fan of improv.
