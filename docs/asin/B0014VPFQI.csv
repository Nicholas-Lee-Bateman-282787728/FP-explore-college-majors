Anything with David Attenborough's fingerprints on it is obviously of high quality.

It features not only terrific secenery, but also blends in aspects of people living along the river banks at its various stages, and the wildlife that thrives in the delta near the ocean. All-in-all I's say it's formula is a successful mixture of Planet Earth, Human Planet, with a pinch of Earth: The Biography.I was sceptical going in, as this is one of the lesser known BBC Earth Productions.

The premise of the story is simple - follow the Ganges from source to delta - and it is the intermingling of people and wildlife that makes the programmes so compelling. Sometimes the interaction can be uplifting - the fisherman feeding the baby otter - and sometimes quite depressing - the tigers that are forced into smaller and smaller spaces to survive. The high definition format brings every whisker and snowflake into sharp relief as well as providing breathtaking views of the mountains and the river valley. Admittedly, some shots - like those of the snow leopard - were not in high definition but, for me, that just reflected the reality of the rareness of these creatures. Up until a few years ago, there was no film of them at all. The extras are interesting (all in normal definition).
