231934,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,6300268098,David Bonesteel,"[17, 17]","A trio of elderly retirees (George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg), who live together in a New York apartment, decide to escape the deadly tedium of their waning years by robbing a bank.  They complete the job successfully, but find that life goes on and a little bit of cash doesn't change everything.  Director/writer Martin Brest and his talented cast avoid the easy road of aiming for a riotous comedy about some cute old men who break the law.  These are fully developed characters, and there are some moments of powerful acting as the story takes these men to some very dark places.  Those who think of Burns and Carney as the epitome of old-time jokey vaudeville-style humor may be surprised by their understated and effective performances.  Of course, Strasberg, the father of method acting, is reliably superb.  There is real joy in this film as well.  The scenes in which the three old friends seem to come alive again during a day spent in the city preparing for their bank job and a later one in Las Vegas are wonderful and feature very good acting.

231937,A121660P9WJSER,6300268098,"Hose Nose ""B-film buff""","[3, 3]","One of the best movies with a focus on older folks EVER made. Period. Every actor gets his opportunity to shine and they all do, with gusto. This is, without a doubt, George Burns at his absolute best as an actor. He simply IS the heart of this movie. He is by turns sympathetic, bitter, confused, remorseful, angry, delighted, ashamed, self-loathing and of course, always cantankerous. He's just pitch-perfect here. And relatively new at the time actor Charles Hallahan really shines as Pete, the nephew of Art Carney's delightfully loveable teddy bear character, Al. You knew that Hallahan had good things ahead of him with his wonderful turn in a small, but memorable part. Carney steals every scene he's in. The Vegas crap table scene is pure movie magic with two old pros just having an absolute blast and they are a joy to watch together. Lee Strasberg's character doesn't get much screen time, but the key emotional scene between him & Art Carney shows why the man was such a well-respected acting legend. It's still hard to believe that a movie about the elderly could be so winning, insightful and touching... and was written by a then 27 year old man! Kudos to writer/director Martin Brest!The DVD is an early Warner Bros release in one of those annoying cardboard snapcase boxes, with essentially zero extras. Sadly, all the main contributors of this little masterpiece have long since passed on now, with the exception of director Martin Brest. They really dropped the ball by not tasking someone with getting interviews with and/or commentary from Burns & Carney while they were still with us. I understand that Going in Style is currently being remade as a vehicle for Bill Murray, so perhaps the original will get dusted off and released onto Bluray when the remake hits theaters. Hopefully someone will dig into the archives and unearth some interviews or talk show appearances of the actors involved to include as extras, along with a retrospective director's commentary from Martin Brest.

Burns (especiallly) gives the performance of a lifetime at age 83, while Carney and Strasberg cemented their legendary status even further in this enjoyable film depicting what life can be like for three old men, and the sudden radical idea to get attention and have the time of their lives. These guys decide to rob a bank, and when the bank manager doesn't take them seriously, Burns fires a shot at the clock, thus sending a message that the elderly aren't to be taken for granted. The guys wind up netting a lot of money, but the thrill and adrenaline rush turns to stress which takes a toll on Strasberg and Carney, while Burns survives and goes to jail.
