Yes, it was dark, violent, and bloody; that was the best part of the movie. People change their personalities, disappear, and act really stupid (actually, the stupid ones seem to survive).

The people who die had no reason to, there's no reason for the survivors to live, there's no cause for the bad guys to be bad or the good guys to be good, there's no explanation of why the good guys' leaders are constantly smoking -- there's not even a description of how the people can carry small daypacks for ten days in the wilderness and end up with changes of clothing, parkas, tents, and food (let alone all the cigarettes the leader is smoking)could have done without the kids voiceover telling the audience whats pretty much immediately happening onscreen.

You can't fault the concept, and indeed the movie starts off strong.  The location scout found an amazing and picturesquely striking abandoned factory to shoot a scene in at the beginning, which was gorgeous.  I had thought a lot of the movie would take place there.  Instead, we move on to more traditional low-budget locations.We never get a strong sense of plot.  Mister and Martin are on their way to New Eden in Canada.  Why?  They never tell us.  They find a nice place to stop on the way, so why didn't they stay?  We don't know what's driving the New Eden goal.  We never get a strong sense of the rules.  What can the vampires do?  How do you kill them?  How light sensitive are they?  It varies somewhat based on the scene.  The pacing is awful, and because there isn't a strong plot, when the movie bogs down about 2/3 of the way through, it just stalls.  For something that weighs it at an hour forty, it feels like a lot longer.The ending is the worst part, as something happens that is never explained, and then the movie simply stops, more than it ends.I applaud the attempt to try something new; our leads are good actors; and it's really cool to see Kelly McGillis again.

1436376,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B0051CSI0G,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[3, 5]","An unidentified plague has wiped out civilization - its victims are transformed into vicious, carnivorous animals who feast on the living.  No, not zombies - vampires, killed with a stake through the heart.  One man, a vampire hunter/killer known only as Mister, traverses the wrecked countryside with an apprentice, a teen boy the hunter took under his wing after the boy's family was slaughtered by the creatures.  Together, they and a few other stragglers try to reach Canada - 'New Eden' - while avoiding vampires and cultists who see the plague as the work of God.This film has one specific flaw - otherwise this is actually an excellent, albeit gory, apocalyptic genre film.  Depending on how one feels about this flaw will probably determine - if one is already predisposed to like these kinds of films - how well they enjoy 'Stakeland'.  The problem is that it just takes itself too darn serious.Martin, the boy apprentice, narrates portions of the story, and, similar to a Terrence Malick film, this narration doesn't always match up with the onscreen action.  The boy's voice, plus musical and visual cues, elicit a great deal of melacholy, and create a heightened sense of drama.  This has a much better chance of working in a film such asDays of Heavenbecause it takes place in a world that is at least recognizable, if not familiar.  In 'Stake Land', this effort at emotional heft seems ridiculously overwrought.  I'm unable to fully let go and immerse myself in the story's fantastic elements, because the film keeps trolling for my sympathy, and by that very act disrupts my suspension of disbelief.There's a very good chance that others will not feel this way about the film.  For those who can ignore this emotional ploy, or who don't notice it, or who can buy into it, I think the rest of the film works pretty well.  There were several unsurprising moments, but then there were also some that I didn't see coming - and, given the premise, much of the character's motivations and actions seem consitent.  Nick Damici, as the hunter Mister, is a bit too cool for school, but doubtless that will be more attractive rather than detrimental to a large portion of the audience for this film.Overall, one significant flaw, which for me, seriously impinges on the film's rating.  Still worth a definite look by horror fans, especially those intrigued by the post-apocalypse genre.A defect on the rental disc prevented me from watching the bonus materials included on the blu-ray.

It's name conjured a campy and cheesy vampire flick, which there is nothing wrong with if you are in the mood for it.  This movie was far, far, from my expectations.  It was a wonderfully told and acted piece about a vampire apocalypse and a small band of survivors struggling to find a safe place.  It was bleak, gritty, and raw but didn't feel cheaply made at all.  It actually had a very AMC's Walking Dead feel to it.  There were no fancy and flashy special effects, just very decent makeup and gore.

Martin and his mentor, Mister, set off through dangerous territory in the hopes of reaching the safe haven known as New Eden, but in order to do so, they will have to fight their way through hordes of the undead, let alone an army of crazed religious fanatics that have embraced ""God's wrath."" Nick Damici and Jim Mickle follow up their vastly underrated feature debut, MULBERRY STREET, with another powerful post-apocalyptic vision of hell starring Damici as the mysterious vampire slayer, ""Mister."" The scope of the picture feels all-encompassing, transforming the entire world into an undead nightmare on a relatively small-scale. Damici creates an excellent new anti-hero in Mister, with his brash behavior and uncaring attitude amounting to a memorable performance overall. Connor Paolo comes as a much bigger surprise, however, as Mister's argil apprentice, Martin. His sincerity and vulnerability are what draw us in to their unfortunate predicament as they race for survival. With the human element already in place, we turn to the unbridled terror of Mickle's vampires. The creatures function on a level of base instinct, and attack with the ferocity of an untamed animal. This makes for many frighteningly intense moments as Mister and Martin find themselves in inescapable situations against overwhelming odds.

1436386,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0051CSI0G,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","The stylish 2010 independent horror film ""Stake Land"" is a variation of a lot of previous works, some better, quite a few not. It's a moody vision, dripping with overcast days and the corrosion of a dying world. The key to its success is attitude, and filmmakers play the game with a straight face. I love the atmosphere, as morose as anything seen in the bigger-budgetedThe Road.Sometime in the not-too-distant future, the world is overcome by the obligatory virus rendering the dead into a form of vampire/zombies. They can only be killed by a stake through the heart. Rural teenager Martin (Connor Paolo) becomes an orphan in the opening scene, but he's saved by the mysterious stranger Mister (Nick Damici), a trench coat wearing warrior whose obsessive mission appears to be ridding the land of the undead. He adopts Martin as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and they travel cross country in a coughing Buick, taking down Nosferatus wherever they may roam. It's a fun set-up, aided by unshaven facades and worn clothes having seen better days. During their journey they encounter pockets of civilization, fortified compounds involved in trade, heavily guarded when the sun goes down.Okay, the apocalyptic genre has been around in countless films including the recentZombielandand28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition), but ""Stake Land"" imagines a dying society unusually plausible. Cities are trashed and terrifyingly lawless. Mister has been there and done that, a fascinating character combining the attitude of Snake Plissken (Escape from New York) with the athleticism ofBlade. I don't know if Damici is a great actor (this is the first time I've seen his work), but he fits this Eastwood-esque role like a worn leather glove. The youthful Paolo also displays excellent presence and together, they make a sympathetic team. They're on a quest of sorts and pick up several refugees along the way, including a former nun (a barely recognizable Kelly McGillis), a pregnant teenager (Danielle Harris) and a surviving hostage of a religious cult (Sean Nelson). Oh yes, the religious cult, adorned in military gear with shaved heads. They preach the Bible and dream dictatorship.There's quite a bit of symbolism going on here as Mister leads the way through purgatory and militaristic zealotry, including a desolate hike along a mountain trail where it appears they're being tracked by an unknown menace. What I love about these segments is the vampires become secondary and character motivations are more crucial. This great survival dynamic, akin in many ways to the almost forgottenRed Dawn, is ruined somewhat by an unnecessary final conflict. When the menace makes its appearance, following a series derivative scenes in the clich&eacute;d abandoned warehouse, you'll say aloud, ""And you were doing so well!"" Anyway, the film rebounds nicely with an effective conclusion and it's telling I would actually enjoy a sequel.Director Jim Mickle (who co-wrote the screenplay with Damici) has done a great job in creating atmosphere and detail. I have not seen his previous workMulberry Street, evidently a similar horror excursion. But I'm going to check it out. ""Stake Land"" has cult film written all over it, and in this case, is deserving of such status.

1436397,A2XSGVBHS37L2B,B0051CSI0G,"D. Mills ""WatchThis""","[0, 1]","No matter how you slice it (pun intended), there's nothing wrong with a good monster apocalypse. Since you've shown up here, you're probably following The Walking Dead in their zombified cruise through the southland, and have watched the 28 Days and Months series.  Stake Land gives vampires equal time, in a worldwide cataclysm that brings down governments and makes life miserable for those who are still living and breathing humans. Filmed in a bleak Pennsylvania during the winter of 2009-2010, it follows young Martin and his badass mentor as they escape the ravages of some unexplained bloodsucker invasion. Along the way they run into all manner of ne'er-do-wells, and some try-to-do-gooders in the form of a woman-of-the-cloth, and a young pregnant survivor. Their ride is a hulking old 1969 Mercury Marquis, which can (and does) manage to make a pancake of anything in its path (Spoiler Alert: the Mercury does die, succumbing to battery problems. This forces out troupe to walk for awhile, which is a convenient plot device).So far so good. The problem, as I see it, is that all of this just doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts, much less more than that sum.  It's not so much that we've seen some of the plot devices before, it's that they are not used as effectively as they could be. For example, our coterie tunes into radio broadcasts as they cruise the barren countryside in their Merc. But unlike 28 Days Later, nothing comes of them, as if the voices on the radio were solely entertainment for a moment. The problem is not that the vamps resemble the tattered zombies from Walking Dead, but it's the blank slate regarding their origin that is never really explained. In 28 Days Later, we learn how the plague is spread from monster to human. Here, that's never made clear. How do humans get covered in vampire blood (as these characters do) and not get Turned Into One of Them? I suppose we need a good chomping bite. Yes, we saw those, but in those cases the humans died rather than being transformed into wandering evil beings.The acting is adequate and occasionally rises above average, as with the pregnant Danielle Harris. Writer Nick Damici doubles as the acting badass who is showing Connor Paolo's young Martin the ropes, but never adds much depth to his characterization. Paolo is an enthusiastic young disciple, but aspects of his portrayal are pallid, including narration that has just a bit too much of a 'Jeremiah' folksiness to it (this was a short-lived series from the creators of Babylon 5, focusing on migrating post-apocalyptic humans, without the gore).The Blu-ray disc impressively handles the dark tones of the film, and the two commentaries (one with actors, one with production and film techs) are a generous and informative bonus. Coming in with a separate Making Of and a Video Diary of the production, no one can accuse this package of being skimpy. It's just that I wish the main feature had a certain sparkle that made a more lasting impression. If by any chance you're a zombie apocalypse newbie, watch 28 Days Later instead, and consider starting on The Walking Dead series on AMC. If that's not enough world decimation for one year, you can check out Stake Land.",3,Entertains But Lacks A Certain Spark,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,3221,"['matter', 'how', 'slice', 'pun', 'intended', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'good', 'monster', 'apocalypse', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'up', 'here', ""'re"", 'probably', 'following', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'zombified', 'cruise', 'southland', 'have', 'watched', '28', 'Days', 'Months', 'series', 'Stake', 'Land', 'vampires', 'equal', 'time', 'worldwide', 'cataclysm', 'down', 'governments', 'life', 'miserable', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'breathing', 'humans', 'Filmed', 'bleak', 'Pennsylvania', 'winter', '2009-2010', 'young', 'Martin', 'badass', 'mentor', 'escape', 'ravages', 'unexplained', 'bloodsucker', 'invasion', 'way', 'run', 'manner', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'try-to-do-gooders', 'form', 'woman-of-the-cloth', 'young', 'pregnant', 'survivor', 'ride', 'hulking', 'old', '1969', 'Mercury', 'Marquis', 'can', 'manage', 'make', 'pancake', 'anything', 'path', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Mercury', 'die', 'succumbing', 'battery', 'problems', 'out', 'troupe', 'walk', 'awhile', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', '.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'problem', 'see', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'sum', 'parts', 'much', 'less', 'more', 'sum', 'not', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'as', 'effectively', 'could', 'be', 'example', 'coterie', 'tunes', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'cruise', 'barren', 'countryside', 'Merc', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'nothing', 'voices', 'radio', 'were', 'solely', 'entertainment', 'moment', 'problem', 'not', 'vamps', 'resemble', 'tattered', 'zombies', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'blank', 'slate', 'regarding', 'origin', 'never', 'really', 'explained', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'learn', 'how', 'plague', 'spread', 'monster', 'human', 'Here', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'How', 'do', 'humans', 'get', 'covered', 'vampire', 'blood', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Turned', 'Into', 'One', 'Them', 'suppose', 'need', 'good', 'chomping', 'bite', 'Yes', 'saw', 'cases', 'humans', 'died', 'rather', 'being', 'transformed', 'wandering', 'evil', 'beings.The', 'acting', 'adequate', 'occasionally', 'rises', 'average', 'pregnant', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Writer', 'Nick', 'Damici', 'acting', 'badass', 'who', 'showing', 'Connor', 'Paolo', 'young', 'Martin', 'ropes', 'never', 'much', 'depth', 'characterization', 'Paolo', 'enthusiastic', 'young', 'disciple', 'aspects', 'portrayal', 'are', 'pallid', 'including', 'narration', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', ""'Jeremiah"", 'folksiness', 'was', 'short-lived', 'series', 'creators', 'Babylon', '5', 'focusing', 'migrating', 'post-apocalyptic', 'humans', 'gore', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'impressively', 'dark', 'tones', 'film', 'two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'actors', 'one', 'production', 'film', 'techs', 'are', 'generous', 'informative', 'bonus', 'Coming', 'separate', 'Making', 'Video', 'Diary', 'production', 'one', 'can', 'accuse', 'package', 'being', 'skimpy', 'just', 'wish', 'main', 'feature', 'had', 'certain', 'sparkle', 'made', 'more', 'lasting', 'impression', 'chance', ""'re"", 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'newbie', 'watch', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'instead', 'consider', 'starting', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'series', 'AMC', 'not', 'enough', 'world', 'decimation', 'one', 'year', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'Stake', 'Land']",N/A

First of all, the characters weren't fully developed, they remained ciphers throughout (and worse, unlikable).  Second, the `action' was simply that overused gimmick, ""hit and run.""  I could time when the next event was going to occur; it went like clockwork.  This type of repetition speaks of a lazy mind (in this case, 2 writers).  Also, too many lulls in a film purporting to be action/horror is a grave mistake.  These weren't helped by the taciturn drawl of the narrator, Martin (Connor Paolo), who droned his tale of woe throughout.  There was absolutely no attempt to sustain any horror element in this movie, not even basic tension.  Which is odd considering it's billed as a horror movie, a vampire movie at that.  You would think with material of that nature they would have no trouble building suspense, but no, they quickly tossed aside all the potentially exciting scenes, as if they were in the way of the boring road trip with an unemotional man and his boy sidekick.  I wish I could say they had a few surprises along the way but no, they didn't.  The so-called climatic sequence was one that could be seen coming hours earlier!  (I know it's only 98 minutes long but it felt like an eternity to me.)  If this sounds like I don't have anything to recommend, wait, it gets worse.  This movie also took on a decidedly anti-Christian point of view.  The level of bile directed at Christians went from ""crazy cult"" to ""Christian crazies,"" in the blink of an eye.  This movie even went so far as to place the `Christian menace' above that of the ""vamps.""  I haven't seen that much hatred onscreen since the last Stephen King screed: The Mist.

A plague has devastated Earth and people are turning into Vampire-Zombies. A young boy, Martin, has lost his parents. He hooks up with a ""hunter"" (of said creatures) called ""Mr."" and he learns the trade as they make their way north to ""New Eden"" in the hopes of a better life. Of course things don't go smoothly.This has more in common with ""The Walking Dead"" than it does with ""Night of the Living Dead."" Though the attacks come with enough regularity to keep things from getting bogged down, it focuses more on how various people cope with the new state of things than it does with outright mayhem. The individuals, and groups of people, they come across all attempt to find their niche in the new world. When they're in the south, where religious fervor is at a peak, and many of the survivors view the plague as the hand of God punishing the wicked, things get real interesting. This actually comprises a large part of the plot throughout.  They also spend a fair amount time showing the man and boy developing their relationship (such as it is), so when the final scene comes, it all makes sense.Though not an expensive movie, the budget was good enough to give it polished look. The camerawork and editing were smooth. The music was better than it had to be. The acting was also very good. I didn't recognize anyone save for Kelly McGillis. (nice to see her working) but no one stuck out as being less than professional. My only complaints (and these are minor) are that I didn't much care for the creature make-up and it did get a bit slow in parts.This is a very thoughtful and mature entry into the genre. There is a good balance of mood, horror and social consciousness. If you're looking for a mindless bloodfest then don't bother.

Here we have undead creatures that combine the gruesomeness of zombies with the blood lust and physical prowess of vampires.Given the grimness of our ecomony, an ever burgeoning distrust of our political leaders by a nation screwed over by greed and powerlust, Stake Land, with its almost biblical allegorical qualities is poised to strike a chord that may reach beyond only just horror audiences.It's difficult not to draw comparisons with the television hit ""The Walking Dead"" as much as with Cormac McCarthy's The Road - and with a bit of his earlier ""Blood Meridian"" thrown in for good measure.Through classic, linear lines the story is narrated through a series of voiceovers by its protagonist, Martin (Connor Paolo), a teenager who, as they prepare to escape and move north witnesses the brutal massacre of his entire family by the.  Saved by ""Mister"" (Nick Damici - who co-wrote the screenplay) the two take to the road in search of New Eden (Canada) holding on to a desperate hope that something resembling normality will be found across the border.  In short order, we watch as Martin learns to fight, and the script's well-written voiceovers (all from Martin's point of view) provide background, commentary (sometimes on the obvious) and are beautifully delivered by young Mr. Paolo.In classic road movie (or Wizard of Oz) fashion, the pair expands into a trio (with Kelly McGillis), then quartet (Sean Nelson) and eventually a quintet (Danielle Harris) as they search for food and fend off vamps.  Along the way, survival becomes further compromised as we meet The Aryan Brotherhood - a group of religious wack jobs led by Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris, dripping with evil) who, in a strong nod toward the kooks who explained AIDS as God's vengeance on a world lacking their personal morality, have discovered creative ways to use the vamps to further their twisted mission.The film is clearly not going to appeal to certain horror/vampire film fans, what with its unrelenting severity of tone, understated acting, and offbeat, original chamber music style score by Jeff Grace, but that's their loss as director, Jim Mickel, art directors  Michael Ahern and Beck Underwood along with cinematographer Ryan Samul have given us a horror flick that is at all times visually stunning and emotionally charged by an enormous heart and done this without skimping out on delicious amounts of blood and gore.

1436419,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B0051CSI0G,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[1, 1]","4 Stars = Classic""Stake Land"" plays like an apocalyptic Zombie film with Vampires instead. That being said, the Vampires in this film are but Zombies with Vampire physical traits, & even that is minimal, with no supernatural shape shifting abilities, though their make up is effectively feral in appearance. Their mental capacity is about Zombie level, though they have evolved in to two types of Vampires, with one stronger & harder to kill than the other. It appears they may be evolving more, which is an interesting idea, but it is a thin line to hang a whole film on. Now most of what I've wrote so far, really doesn't sound to interesting, or original, but this is only one aspect of the plot...""Stake Land"" is a chameleon. Yes, it's an apocalyptic Zombie like, Vampire film, but it's also plays out like a western, especially a bounty hunter western. It is a road movie. It is a film that makes statements about how the human race will become fragmented, becoming just as much of a menace to it's self as the Vampires are, with fanatical religious groups, in this case extremist Christians, taking the appearance of Vampires as a sign of God's wrath, & feeding the non-believers to the Vampires as a sacrifice to God. It also taps into the male domination of women through religion, though it takes this premise to extremes, it is also conceivable that these things could & would happen with religious male extremists. So here's a little more fuel to the fire. Still, it's been done before, though...The thing that makes ""Stake Land"" a great little film as opposed to a mediocre been there, done that film, is it's great acting, script, direction, & personal characters plot line interaction. Yes, this is an apocalyptic film, but seen at the very personal level of two characters, teenager ""Martin,"" whose family was destroyed by Vampires, & ""Mister,"" ( who reminds me of the Troll Hunter in ""Troll Hunter"") who saves his life & teaches him to be a Vampire hunter. There is a real relationship here, as ""Mister"" becomes a surrogate father figure to Martin, & as gruff & grizzled as Mister is, there are moments that shows his love of Martin, like a son. The two go on their journey meeting & helping other people, actually building strong relationships with these people, who are struggling against the Vampires & the religious extremists. These relationships are quite real, & touching. You get to know these characters. You get to care about these characters, & that is this film's saving grace, even though as preposterous a setting as Vampires taking over the world is, ""Stake Land"" remains a very human film, about human relationships, with all the love & hate that goes with human relationships. This makes ""Stake Land"" much deeper than most of it's sub-genre ilk. In a way, this makes ""Stake Land"" the Vampire equivalent to """"28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later."" It gives you people to care about as those films did. It is no where as groundbreaking as those films, but in the end, it's those little everyday relationships we have, that make life & this movie, worth while.",4,It's Humanity That Saves This From Beiing Just Another Apocalyptic Film,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3086,"['4', 'Stars', '=', 'Classic', 'Stake', 'Land', 'apocalyptic', 'Zombie', 'film', 'Vampires', 'instead', 'being', 'said', 'Vampires', 'film', 'are', 'Zombies', 'Vampire', 'physical', 'traits', 'even', 'minimal', 'supernatural', 'shape', 'shifting', 'abilities', 'make', 'up', 'effectively', 'feral', 'appearance', 'mental', 'capacity', 'Zombie', 'level', 'have', 'evolved', 'two', 'types', 'Vampires', 'one', 'stronger', 'harder', 'kill', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'evolving', 'more', 'interesting', 'idea', 'thin', 'line', 'hang', 'whole', 'film', 'Now', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'wrote', 'so', 'far', 'really', ""n't"", 'sound', 'interesting', 'original', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'plot', 'Stake', 'Land', 'chameleon', 'Yes', 'apocalyptic', 'Zombie', 'Vampire', 'film', 'also', 'out', 'western', 'especially', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'western', 'road', 'movie', 'film', 'statements', 'how', 'human', 'race', 'will', 'become', 'fragmented', 'becoming', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'menace', 'Vampires', 'are', 'fanatical', 'religious', 'groups', 'case', 'extremist', 'Christians', 'taking', 'appearance', 'Vampires', 'sign', 'God', 'wrath', 'feeding', 'non-believers', 'Vampires', 'sacrifice', 'God', 'also', 'male', 'domination', 'women', 'religion', 'premise', 'extremes', 'also', 'conceivable', 'things', 'could', 'would', 'happen', 'religious', 'male', 'extremists', 'So', 'here', 'little', 'more', 'fuel', 'fire', 'Still', 'been', 'done', 'thing', 'Stake', 'Land', 'great', 'little', 'film', 'opposed', 'mediocre', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'script', 'direction', 'personal', 'characters', 'plot', 'line', 'interaction', 'Yes', 'apocalyptic', 'film', 'seen', 'very', 'personal', 'level', 'two', 'characters', 'teenager', 'Martin', 'family', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Vampires', 'Mister', 'who', 'Troll', 'Hunter', 'Troll', 'Hunter', 'who', 'life', 'be', 'Vampire', 'hunter', 'real', 'relationship', 'here', 'Mister', 'surrogate', 'father', 'figure', 'Martin', 'gruff', 'grizzled', 'Mister', 'are', 'moments', 'love', 'Martin', 'son', 'two', 'go', 'journey', 'meeting', 'helping', 'other', 'people', 'actually', 'building', 'strong', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'Vampires', 'religious', 'extremists', 'relationships', 'are', 'quite', 'real', 'touching', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'get', 'care', 'characters', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'even', 'as', 'preposterous', 'setting', 'Vampires', 'taking', 'world', 'Stake', 'Land', 'very', 'human', 'film', 'human', 'relationships', 'love', 'hate', 'human', 'relationships', 'Stake', 'Land', 'much', 'deeper', 'most', 'sub-genre', 'ilk', 'way', 'Stake', 'Land', 'Vampire', 'equivalent', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'people', 'care', 'films', 'did', 'where', 'as', 'groundbreaking', 'films', 'end', 'little', 'everyday', 'relationships', 'have', 'make', 'life', 'movie', 'worth']",N/A

Martin, a young boy, is taken under the wing of a vampire hunter, Mister, after his family is viciously slaughtered. The pair are heading North towards New Eden, but find vampires aren't the only predators out there...I enjoy the story in Stake Land. It starts off immediately in the post-apocalyptic world. Martin and Mister are heading North, which is supposed to be safe; they avoid the graveyard-like large cities and use the back roads. However, the vampires aren't the worst thing out in the wild... the living humans can be just as vicious as the undead, if not more. Along the way, they find small cities with survivors trying to get by, they find crazies in the woods, they connect with people like them, and they kill many vampires. It's a survival-apocalyptic blend, and I genuinely enjoy it.The acting is great from the entire cast. There are a few lines of dialogue that felt cheesy and unnatural, but only a few. The story feels like a realistic vampire survival guide, and it keeps this vibe throughout. There is one scene that hurt the realism in the film, and it was a showdown-like scene that felt clich&eacute;. The entire atmosphere of the film is bleak, dark and immersive; the story itself is also very bleak as death is around every corner and no one is exempt, including children. It's moderately paced, although it can feel slow at times. The special effects and makeup are great, I really liked the design of the vampires.Overall, I really enjoyed Stake Land; it's an immersive post-apocalyptic horror film that manages to entertain immensely.

That's the case with Stake Land, a vampire movie where the bloodsuckers are the obvious bad guys, but are by no means the most dangerous.In Stake Land there has been an outbreak of vampirism, and humanity has been splintered into lone travelers and small communities. The communities operate on a barter system and rely on the travelers to bring in food, medicines, tools, and luxury items. And everyone waits for confirmation of the safe zone in the north, New Eden.Mister (Nick Damici - Mulberry Street) is a loner who saves Martin (Connor Paolo - Gossip Girl) from the vampire attack that killed his parents. Instead of dropping Martin at one of the communities, Mister is training him to become a vampire hunter, one of the most respected and needed commodities on this frontier. Along the way they team up with pregnant waitress, Belle (Danielle Harris - Hatchet 2), war veteran Willie (Sean Nelson - The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3) and with a woman of the cloth, Sister (Kelly McGillis - Top Gun), who they have also saved from a couple of rapists from the Brotherhood.The Brotherhood is an organization that uses radio broadcasts offering salvation and safety, then keeps women for recreation, as long as they are usable, robs travelers, recruits the willing and the unwilling become bait. One of their favorite ways to take over an enclave is by dropping captured vampires into community, waiting for the carnage to conclude, and enter the camp to loot and take prisoners. This pleasant group is led by Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris - Fringe), and he has taken a personal interest in the demise of Mister, for the killing of his son, one of the rapists. He continues to broadcast his propaganda, but has added a description and reward for Mister and Martin. If you didn't see that coming the next couple run-ins with each other will surprise you.Stake Land is your classic good versus evil, with a refreshingly simple character development. The good guys are good, and the bad guys are bad. When Mister takes Martin under his wing, there is no doubt it's so Martin will be able to learn to take care of himself, and know that there are people that care about you. The same goes for Jebedia and his merry band. He has no compassion for others and will take care of himself at the expense of anyone who has what he wants. Another aspect of this movie that sets this apart from other post apocalypse is the authenticity of the settings. The abandoned buildings and stark landscape paints an odd picture of desperation and hope, hope that the buildings will someday be inhabited.I'm not a Special Features sort of person, beyond deleted scenes, blooper reels, and the occasional commentary, but this movie has a feature I hadn't seen done with the finesse of this one. Stake Land has seven character prequels, though one is an origin short, which gives some sort of an insight to the main characters.

1436432,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0051CSI0G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[24, 27]","Having had a successful run at midnight movie showings, I wasn't expecting much seriousness from a movie entitled ""Stake Land."" But I was pleasantly surprised by this bleak and well-made creature feature in which man might be the most dangerous enemy left. In truth, there are very few elements within the film that haven't been utilized abundantly in other movies--but despite their familiar nature, ""Stake Land"" is still quite effective on its own terms. Well acted, suspenseful, and with good effects--I'd say this has the potential to be a sleeper hit on the DVD market as more people become familiar with it. Cobbling plot points from sources as diverse as Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" to ""Zombieland"" to almost everything in between, the film has a surprising heft and gravitas that distinguishes it from other noticeably lighter genre fare.Cinema's fascination with a post-apocalyptic world continues here as the movie is set in a time where an epidemic of vampirism has extinguished most of the human race. In reality, this plays much more like a zombie epic and that's truthfully what it is. The creatures have pointy teeth, but the script follows the conventions you'd expect from an outbreak of the reanimated. A rogue warrior travels the land with a teenage companion as the two try to make it to a rumored land of safety called New Eden. Along the way, they meet threats of all sorts and even pick up a few stragglers. Whole towns of survivors are barricaded and fortified against the monster menace. But perhaps the most alarming enemy are the new religious zealots who see the vampires as vengeance against the wicked. In a land overtaken by lawlessness, monsters may be the easiest foe to fight.The script is tidy and provides a narration that is haunting and well done. Nick Damici (who also has a screenwriter credit) plays the enigmatic hero and Connor Paolo is his protege. Both are believable and sympathetic, and they develop an effective chemistry that grounds the picture. A supporting cast that includes Kelly McGillis, Sean Nelson, and Danielle Harris further make this a movie in which you actually care about the characters! In many ways, the vampires are secondary to the human story of survival and hope in the midst of mayhem. The creatures are well done and the effects are solid--but again, I was more sold on the human drama than anything else. Surprisingly good overall--made all the more remarkable because of my admittedly low expectations. Why this wasn't released on a larger scale, I'm not sure. But if you like zombies, vampires, and/or post-apocalyptic drama--this checks all the requisite boxes.

In the case of ""Stake Land,"" it's about what each character has to lose.At stake for Mister (Nick Damici) is the survival of his young ward, Martin (Connor Paolo). At stake for Belle (Danielle Harris) is the birth of her child in a hostile world.  At stake for Jebedia Loven (Michael Cerveris) is his fanatical faith, a position diametrically posed to the kind-hearted nun Sister (Kelly McGillis).  Everyone has something to lose in a world roiled by a vampire plague, where rapists, murderers, and human apathy are as much a threat as the blood-sucking hordes.And so Mister and Martin make their way, collecting vampire fangs as currency, with Mister teaching his apprentice how to effectively kill the monsters.  They work best as a pair, but Mister has his own personal code that causes him to immediately murder two rapists -- which will have serious repercussions later.What ""Stake Land"" does best is not focus on the vampires (basically, sun-fearing zombies), but on the ragtag family that forms around Mister and Martin.  As each survivor slowly succumbs to the cruel world, Mister begins to consider what his goals really are.  New Eden, a place that may or may not exist, comes to represent that future.  In a world chock full of vampires, when can a vampire hunter truly be at peace?Mister's evolution: as protector, as guardian, and finally as parent, leaves him with only one answer.  To ""Stake Land's"" credit, it doesn't give us neatly wrapped endings but instead leaves us with hope.

Best compared as ""The Road"" meets ""30 Days of Night,"" it's a very intense film that grabs you early and does not let you go.A teenage boy (maybe 15-16 years old) is rescued by a ""lone warrior"" from a vampire attack that leaves his entire family dead. The lone warrior (sort of a cross between Wesley Snipe's ""Blade"" with a badass Mickey Rourke attitude) teaches the boy how to fight and kill vampires as they travel up north to find the salvation city of ""New Eden."" They pick up a handful of fellow travellers along the way and they slowly become a ""family"" of sorts. These characters (particularly the ""lone warrior"") are stereotypical yet developed enough to not come across as cheesy or cliche. Not only do the travellers have to worry about vampires, as mankind may be even more dangerous: rapists, killers, psychos, and murderous religious fanatics- who are a combination of all these things.As you can see, the plot is not overly original. However, what it lacks in originality it makes up for with other strong qualities: the acting is solid and the movie itself is bleak as hell. As the film goes on, the elements of helplessness and doom escalates with a terrifically sad violin music score. And it only gets bleaker as it goes on. No sexy teen vamps that sparkle in sunlight, here, folks. The vampires are refreshingly gross and creepy with rotting skin and animalistic behaviour. The scenes with the religious cult leader are frightening, making you wonder which is worse: vampires or mankind.Even with its low budget, Stake Land runs circles around similar movies that have much higher budgets. The story is a very solid road movie (think of a very serious ""Zombieland"") that is bleak, dismal, and very well made. There is plenty of action in the movie, but its not overly gorey. There is more story than action, which is why this movie is elevated above your standard action fare: while there are horror elements in the movie, I'd classify it as a ""dark drama"" and not a ""horror"" movie.PQ is actually very good (which I truley wasn't expecting). Colors don't pop off the screen and the blacks aren't entirely inky- there's some crush / noise in there- but overall a very pleasant looking film.If you enjoy end of the world movies and/ or vampire movies, you should definitely check this movie out. There are admittedly a few scenes here and there where the low budgetness of the movie shows, but overall this is well worth watching.

Stake Land is an effort from director Jim Mickle, who previously helmed a bleak and understated horror flick called Mulberry Street a few years back, which still ranks as probably the best film to ever come out carrying the After Dark Horrorfest banner.  With Stake Land, Mickle presents to us an apocalyptic wasteland that the vamps are terrorizing and feeding off of.  For teenager Martin (Connor Paolo), his means of survival are being accompanied by the mysterious Mister (Mulberry Street star Nick Damici) as they come across various other survivors (including Kelly McGillis and genre stalwart Danielle Harris) and an insane religious cult while attempting to make their way to the supposedly untouched land of New Eden.  Violent, scary, and unapologetically bleak; Stake Land is the kind of horror film that we don't see much of anymore, which in itself is a crying shame.  It pulls no punches and even when it offers a glimmer of hope, it seems so far away that you will be on the edge of your seat to see if our heroes make it or not.  While the film isn't without its flaws, most notably being that various characters appear and are introduced with little in the way of character development to boot, this is undoubtedly the best vampire film I've seen in quite some time.

There is a strong feeling of sincerity and caring and talent to the making of this film. The photography and mood were great, and the feeling about and immersion in backroads America was convincing and even artsy. The script was well-written. The monster/vampires are truly ugly and nasty and predatory/animalistic.The overall mood was extreme sadness about the death of America, the decay of civil society. It is about the take over by the self-decribed Christian crazies who actually encourage the vampires because they want to rule with their sick values in the post-apocalyptic world. They use the vampires as weapons and even dropped them on cities and Washington to hasten the apocalypse.That was the theme really. There were symbols of America everywhere, flags and all and it was clear that the great idealistic dreams were gone, dead.It was difficult to not make comparisons with the present decline of America that the know-nothings seem to actually crave and have been doing things to help along -- as they might say mobilizing and acting to ""retake it"" so that they can be free to pursue their self-righteous anger and hatreds -- somehow or another in their minds in the name of Jesus (The Prince of Peace!! -- OMG, they walk among us now!). I can't help but think this was intentional.WHOA -- I am watching the extras as I type, and they just made it clear that they were indeed affected by our tragic times in the US. So this was a very brave film and will be quite disliked and put down by the hate mongers that have been so riled up these days if they catch the allusions.  I doubt though that the rebs are sufficiently self-reflective to see themselves as destructive hate mongers.The film is certainly not anti-Christian even though the bad guys, over and above the vampires are some sort aryan self-proclaimed Christian network across the country that reminds one of a sort of violence-prone survivalist mentality/society network. So the film makers put in a nun to represent a more sincere model of Christian love and charity. I thought that was a little much at first, but it ended  up working okay. She loses some of her idealism in the course of dealing with the realities of the new order, but at least she has a conscience and does not overdo it.The extra feature ""making-of"" is ""low density"" but somehow engaging if you are not in a rush. It is mostly just footage about working out of doors on the shooting and make up etc. It is nicely done and not  saturated by hype or goofing off scenes as so many extra features are.

1436457,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0051CSI0G,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Stake Land&lt;/strong> (Jim Mickle, 2010)I discovered a simple, but effective, hypothesis back in 2001 that, for the most part, has held up over the past decade: any film that has Larry Fessenden's name on it somewhere is going to provide you with one heck of a good time. (I did have to add a codicil later on that adds the phrase ""as long as Ti West isn't involved"", as Fessenden had cameos in both &lt;em>The Roost&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Cabin Fever 2&lt;/em>.) It started with &lt;em>Session 9&lt;/em>, where he had a small role in front of the camera, and &lt;em>Wendigo&lt;/em>, which he directed, both of which were among the best of 2001. The came the silly, but fun, &lt;em>Zombie Honeymoon&lt;/em>, which he produced, and I went back and saw &lt;em>Animal Factory&lt;/em>, and there was &lt;em>I Sell the Dead&lt;/em>, and... you get the idea. In the middle of all that was a little film that got picked up by After Dark Horrorfest. Normally that's an automatic fail, but for an After Dark movie, it was actually pretty decent, and showed some potential. It was another Fessenden production, with a guy I'd never heard of named Jim Mickle directing, written and starring a tough-looking, quite likable chap named Nick Damici. The movie was called &lt;em>Mulberry St.&lt;/em>, and it ranks among the three or four best movies After Dark has ever released. It's not perfect by any means (viz. 30Mar2009 review), but it had all kinds of potential.Fast-forward a few years, and the team of Mickle, Damici, and Fessenden reunite for &lt;em>Stake Land&lt;/em>, this time put out by Dark Sky Films, who have been responsible for such excellent genre fare as &lt;em>Deadgirl&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Eskalofrio&lt;/em>. You're already guaranteed that at least someone, somewhere, thinks this movie is a whole lot better than &lt;em>Mulberry St.&lt;/em>. The good news: they're right. I wrote the following in that &lt;em>Mulberry St.&lt;/em> review: ""The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs."" Mickle and Damici, who once again co-wrote, haven't completely fixed that problem, but they've gone about 90% of the way. The result is a much better, more affecting movie that still manages to pack in the solid action of their last outing.Plot: Martin (&lt;em>Gossip Girl&lt;/em>'s Connor Paolo) was a normal kid living in Pottstown, PA (nice little place, they used to have an excellent used bookstore, wonder if it's still there?), until they day he watched his parents and infant sister get slaughtered by a vampire. That night, he was saved by a guy known only as Mister (Damici), who we quickly learn is a vampire hunter. Fast-forward a few months, and the two of them are now mentor and apprentice, slowly travelling through the back roads of the American northeast, heading for New Eden (as Canada is called these days), a place where, supposedly, there are no vampires (though a starstruck shopkeeper warns them that rumor has it there's no food up there and folks have turned cannibal). As they're driving along, they gain and lose companions, and the first of these sets up the film's main conflict (no, it's not with the vampires): the boys are forced to slam on the brakes when a bloody, half-dressed nun (&lt;em>Top Gun&lt;/em>'s Kelly McGillis, known only as ""Sister"" in the film) runs across the road, screaming for help, pursued by two guys in burlap bags. It comes on the heels of the cannibal warning, and so you may think that's what happening, but no, these are common rapists Mister puts out of the world's misery. Unfortunately, they also happen to be members of the Aryan Brotherhood, who have risen to fill the power vacuum left by the disintegration of the government under the aegis of Jebediah Loven (&lt;em>Fringe&lt;/em>'s Michael Cerveris), who declare war on Mister and Martin, attacking and harrying them on their journey.It's a good, solid little plot, and has worked well before. It also works well here. Note that those who tag the film as anti-Christian propaganda are missing the entire point (after all, Mister and Martin are traveling with, you know, a nun. The AB may identify as Christian in the movie, but anyone with half a brain sees right through that... don't they?); but we wouldn't be having this conversation if these were cardboard characters, and that's the real draw here. For the first ten or fifteen minutes, I wasn't overly impressed with the acting, but Paolo eventually grows into his role, and the rest of the cast is solid as can be (I didn't get a chance to mention Dianelle Harris, who appeared in both the original and rebooted Halloween franchises, or &lt;em>The Wood&lt;/em>'s Sean Nelson, or small, but extremely effective, cameos for Fessenden and &lt;em>Thicker than Water&lt;/em> beauty Eilis Cahill). This makes for some surprisingly tender moments in the second half of the film, a real unexpected pleasure.But--as if I haven't already declaimed enough about why you should see this movie--one thing kept occurring to me that I haven't seen anyone mention, though I haven't read too many reviews about it. It seemed obvious to me that while the film is, for obvious reasons, being compared to other recent postapocalyptic horror films (both &lt;em>Zombieland&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Road&lt;/em> have received mention in multiple reviews I've read), it seemed equally obvious to me that the movie was actually more influenced by westerns than by horror films. It's most in the forefront in the scene with Fessenden, who plays a pothead bartender in an out-of-the-way watering hole on the road. Seems like a pretty dangerous kind of thing to do in a world full of vampires, setting up shop outside a heavily-fortified town, right? Well, folks, welcome to the Old West... just substitute vampires and the occasional white power loony for rustlers and outlaws. It all makes perfect sense, and might answer some questions I've seen posed.Also: a lot of criticism has been levelled at both the climax of the film and the final shot. Most of it is relatively valid; I think both are love-it-or-hate-it moments. I loved the climax and kinda hated the final shot, but only because it's one of those ""we're leaving it open for a possible sequel"" final shots that annoys me. (Though once again, detractors: if you assume a sequel, suddenly some of the ideas you were complaining about in the climax seem less like they're simply abandoned and more like setup for ideas the be explored in the sequel, yes?) These aren't the movie's only problems, though I can't really talk much about those without getting way into spoiler territory; I will have to leave off by saying that there are some emotional choices made by some of the movie's characters that seem, well, a little abrupt (and a lot out of character given the setup). But these are not reasons you shouldn't see this movie. There are no reason you shouldn't see this movie. Mickle and Damici have gone from ""a coupla kids with a dream and some potential"" to bona fide indie horror auteurs. That should be celebrated, and preferably on the big screen. *** ",4,Solid.,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,7411,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Stake', 'Land', 'lt', '>', 'Jim', 'Mickle', '2010', 'discovered',

1436460,A2TCHXH4SIN2OF,B0051CSI0G,"Severian ""Severian""","[3, 11]","Imagine ""I Am Legend"" being remade for roughly $50,000 and you have this movie's flavor. Zombie-esque vampire plague destroys most of America, leaving a few enclave towns (oddly) untouched and most of the nation a wasteland. ""Mister"" an alleged tough vampire killer wanders the ruined nation with his apprentice Martin, who is our narrator. The two eventually run afoul of a Christian cult that worships the vampires and much strife ensues.This film is surprisingly good in some ways considering it is a low budget first time effort. The set design and cinematography set a nice bleak mood, suiting the theme. The action sequences are filmed pretty well. The special effects and gore all appear to be ""real"", i.e. no CGI. (Take note, George Romero, who uses little else but lame CGI in what passes for his recent zombie films...) The director does have some promise.However, the plot is pretty non-existent and feels both episodic and sluggish. More importantly, the characters are extremely bland and its hard to care about even the leads. Mister is a single note sounded over and over again, Martin is as bland and dull as a post office clerk, and the other characters are even less interesting. The cult leader is about as threatening as a stuffed animal, and the entire Christian vamp cult thing gets too much screen time considering how uninteresting it is in both theory and execution. Someone obviously thought that was a way cool idea, but the viewer may disagree.Some plot elements are fairly half-baked as well. The odd ability of the cult to track the heroes over long distances is not well explained. The existence of the enclave towns also is hard to explain as the vamps are supposedly unstoppable killing machines whom only trained hunters like Mister can deal with, yet a fairly large town seems to be very secure on the basis of a roadblock manned by yokels with shotguns. Just more evidence of a fairly undeveloped script.I really wish there was more going on here with both plot and characters, as the existing mix does not mesh well with the directors technical skill. Hopefully next time, he'll be paired with a better script and actors.

The storyline resembles the Woody Harrelson-Jesse Eisenberg flick ZOMBIELAND, but this is no comedy. The story is told with the just right straight forwardness to be an acceptable piece of goey pulp goodness. This is the sort of horror film that George Romero or John Carpenter might have made in their best years.Set in a post apocalyptic future, after vampires have taken over most of the world, and human, cannibals and scavengers compete for the rest. Focusing more on character and their story than just gore or violence. This is a cool low budget horror opus co-produced by Larry Fessenden, a sort of modern day Val Lewton. Getting some good performances from the likes of horror hottie Danielle Harris, 80's movie star Kelly McGillis, and a scene stealing, should be a star making performance from Nick Damici in the central bad a** role. Damici, who also co-wrote the screenplay with director Jim Mickle, makes me think of a cross between 70's action star Warren Oates and Fred Ward. The dialogue is at times a bit wobbly, and the narration is often pointless and pretentious.

The government has scattered and people are now living in small towns, kept safe by checkpoints and weapons. Religion has adapted, bending to fit the vampire into its lore. Everything is about survival in some way. Martin is traveling with a man who goes by the name of mister, trying to get to a place called New Eden, not overrun by vampires. along the way he learns about how to kill them and how to outsmart them and just what makes them tick. The road is a long and strange one.I avoided this movie for a long time because I figured it for another of the new wave cheap flicks. I readily admit i was wrong. From the start you can see just how well the vampires fit in and just how intimidating they are from the way they sound to the way they move. Add in things like a story that grows and keeps you interested, the addition of new that pop in and out but do not feel generically added to the story, good acting, nice narration, believable fighting, and enough explanation to feel the world and the creatures in it and you have yourself something good.something that impressed me  about Stake Land was the fact that it added a lot of elements in the way the story developed. Sometimes you would be seeing a vampire die or watching training. Other times you might be seeing how a town works or hearing the impact on the government. Nothing too long, but enough overview to make the experience more authentic. I like that. It kept the story going forward, but diverted it just enough to make it interesting.I was also impressed by the acting a lot more than I would have thought. Conner Paolo I knew from the TV Show Revenge, but I never made as a good narrator or as  someone that could make killing a vampire look good. He was both. Nick Diamici offered a nice portrait of a vampire killer as well, straying from the policeman roles I normally see him play in series. Kelly McGillis and Danielle Harris added depth to their characters as well, and Micheal Cerveris make a memorable villain when he popped up.considering the lack of horror these days, good horror anyhow, I felt Stake Land was a treat. a well deserved 5 star watch for me",5,Abandoned by everything but their Dreams,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,2214,"['Stake', 'Land', 'review', 'DVD', 'spoilers', 'world', 'overrun', 'vampires', 'government', 'scattered', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'small', 'towns', 'kept', 'safe', 'checkpoints', 'weapons', 'Religion', 'adapted', 'bending', 'fit', 'vampire', 'lore', 'Everything', 'survival', 'way', 'Martin', 'traveling', 'man', 'who', 'name', 'mister', 'trying', 'get', 'place', 'called', 'New', 'Eden', 'not', 'overrun', 'vampires', 'way', 'how', 'kill', 'how', 'outsmart', 'just', 'what', 'tick', 'road', 'long', 'strange', 'one.I', 'avoided', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'figured', 'new', 'wave', 'cheap', 'flicks', 'readily', 'admit', 'i', 'was', 'wrong', 'start', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'vampires', 'fit', 'just', 'how', 'intimidating', 'are', 'way', 'sound', 'way', 'move', 'Add', 'things', 'story', 'interested', 'addition', 'new', 'pop', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'generically', 'added', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'nice', 'narration', 'believable', 'fighting', 'enough', 'explanation', 'feel', 'world', 'creatures', 'have', 'something', 'good.something', 'impressed', 'Stake', 'Land', 'was', 'fact', 'added', 'lot', 'elements', 'way', 'story', 'developed', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'vampire', 'die', 'watching', 'training', 'Other', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'seeing', 'how', 'town', 'hearing', 'impact', 'government', 'Nothing', 'too', 'long', 'enough', 'overview', 'make', 'experience', 'more', 'authentic', 'kept', 'story', 'going', 'forward', 'diverted', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting.I', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'acting', 'lot', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Conner', 'Paolo', 'knew', 'TV', 'Show', 'Revenge', 'never', 'made', 'good', 'narrator', 'someone', 'could', 'make', 'killing', 'vampire', 'look', 'good', 'was', 'Nick', 'Diamici', 'offered', 'nice', 'portrait', 'vampire', 'killer', 'well', 'straying', 'policeman', 'normally', 'see', 'play', 'series', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'added', 'depth', 'characters', 'well', 'Micheal', 'Cerveris', 'make', 'memorable', 'villain', 'when', 'popped', 'up.considering', 'lack', 'horror', 'days', 'good', 'horror', 'anyhow', 'felt', 'Stake', 'Land', 'was', 'treat', 'well', 'deserved', '5', 'star', 'watch']",N/A
1436477,A27YFC7IUJVG8A,B0051CSI0G,"Troy Hunter ""T.H.""","[4, 7]","Stakeland was a great Vampire/ Zombie movie. The vampires are definitely of the ""30 DAYS of Night "" brand, only more feral and animalistic. The vamps spread over the world and pockets of resistance exist that try to conduct human life as before, but there's another problem lurking about. There's a group of religious zealots who believe that the vampire outbreak is a sign from GOD to cleanse the earth and they use the vampires to do his(their) bidding. Stakeland is a coming of age film about a boy, his vampire killing trainer and a small revolving cast of people who could be his mom, brother and sister, and even girlfriend. Along the way he's faced with a stern un-feeling mentor names Mister who saves his life one fateful night and takes him as a pseudo-son and trains him for the harsh reality of living in a world filled with vampires. As I said, the film works great with good action sequences and down time scenes that don't drag on and help advance the story. My one problem is with the leader of the brotherhood and something that happens that nearly ruined the film for me. (SPOILER ALERT!!!It's a lot like what happened with Steve in Dawn of the Dead. The foreshadowing that if he was to turn, asking Sarah Polley to kill him. We all know what's going to happen right? But look how it happened: We have to overlook why once the zombie bit him, he must have killed it , although he didn't have any type of weapon, and he was given a fatal bite that killed him immediately. See if the zombie kille dhim, what happened to it? Did it run miles away after a killing blow cause he doesn't eat his victims he just kills them?  Why wasn't he ating Steve instead of Steve walking around reanimated? I hated that. Still do. Well we get soemthing akin tot hat here and it was so ridiculous that I almost stopped watching. I gave them a pass on that one small stupid plot device though, and overall I liked the movie anyway. OK. END SPOILER!!)This is a good movie and if you liek your vampires as monsters, this is the film for you. You will enjoy it. Oh, and there's a scene 10 minutes in that I did not think I would ever see in an American film. Something so heinous that I had to rewatch it to make sure I saw it.

This is especially true when you get into vampire type movies. This is a vampire movie that will take you by surprise. It has a good storyline, good acting, intelligence & emotion. It's your typical horror movie in the sense that there are vampires, they only come out at night, you must stake them to kill them, they want blood, have fangs, etc. The only difference is their appearance & the way they act is more zombie like. The movie starts out typical. Vampire plague has taken over, few survivors, no government and a teenage boy who is taken under the wing of a lone man who loves to kill vampires. They head North, to where they believe there are no vampires, the rest of the story is their journey together. There are various people introduced along the way, some good, some not. I found myself bonding with the characters, developing emotional ties, and I never once got bored. This is the movie to watch if you want to see what it probably would have been like in real life if a vampire like plague took over the world.

Now, Director Jim Mickle and writer/actor Nick Damici have updated author Richard Matheson's epic 'I AM LEGEND' by having pockets of people surviving against loathsome vampire hordes instead of one last survivor in 'STAKE LAND', a film combining the morbid atmosphere of Director John Hilcoat's 'THE ROAD'-2009 and the living nightmare of AMC's hit television series 'THE WALKING DEAD' and  utilizing the vampire mythos of Director David Slade's '30 DAYS OF NIGHT'-2007 but without the clannish euphemisms.  The theme focuses on an adolescent played brilliantly by Conner Paolo as we grow to maturity through his eyes as they experience the nightmare which unfolds.  Director Jim Mickle who also helmed the brilliant 'MULBERRY STREET'-2008 is aided by Producer Larry Fessenden who also appears as a bartender ; lead actor Nick Damici who also appeared in 'MULBERRY STREET' and who shares the writing honors on this one ; a ghoulishly evil performance by actor Michael Cerveris and a beautiful cameo by actress Kelly McGillis.  The atmosphere is beautifully stated by photographer Ryan Samul and the nightmare is abetted by a melancholic music score by Jeff Grace.  It may be a zombie movie with fangs but the film emerges as a pleasant surprise as an overwhelming sense of dread hangs over the proceedings.  I saw the Blu-Ray single disc version which has beautiful sound and a crystal 2.35 widescreen transfer but there is a limited edition two disc set also for those who want more special features.
