Prins-Stairs ""Spaction3""","[2, 5]","Evert since the show ended, I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD, finally I got my wish when I saw it on the table of new DVD sets at Best Buy, I didn't have the money for it at that time, but when I did I quickly went back to buy it.  I never saw the first season except for the Red Asphalt episode and it was great.  The first time I actually watched this show in the second Season (which was the season 2 premere) I was hooked on it and I started recording every episode on VHS.  The show is hilarious and more realistic then some other shows in some ways, unlike some of those show where a lot of good things always happen to people and have happy endings all the time, this was darker then the rest and great at it.

907159,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0009K8LCA,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[104, 107]","It truly is a shame that FOX's Titus only lasted three seasons, although, in retrospect, it's amazing that it even did last that long.  The material is probably the darkest stuff I've seen on television (and this is a comedy, remember), the budget must have been tiny (there were only three main sets, and everything else looked recycled).  The show survived on its merit, but fortunately, it deserved all the acclaim it got, plus much more.The show Titus is based off of comedian Christopher Titus' one man stage show entitled Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding, which in turn was based on his real life.  In fact, the members of Titus' family had to sign release forms, as the show was so close to real life.  Titus plays himself, a custom car shop owner who comes from a very dysfunctional family.  His father Ken Titus (Stacey Keach) is a womanizing alcoholic who takes the term ""tough love"" to a whole new level.  His mother Juanita (Julie Wagner/Frances Fisher) is a manic-depressive schizophrenic who, on many occasions, tried to kill Ken.  Half-brother Dave (Zack Ward) is a marijuana-smoking, unintelligent man-boy.  Titus' ""normal"" friend Tommy Shafter (David Shatraw) is sensitive and effeminante, which leads to him being at the butt of a lot of Ken's jokes.  Erin Fitzpatrick (Cynthia Watros) is Titus' loving (but equally screwed up) girlfriend.  She also comes from a dysfunctional family, but she does everything she can to forget about it.The stories are told in a very interesting way; as everything is going on, there are frequent asides from Titus in a black and white ""neutral space"" where he narrates, comments, and sets up jokes.  A lot of the dialogue in the neutral space comes directly from Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding.  The plot of the episodes range from the group fearing that Ken is dead because he hasn't left his room in four days... not even to get a beer, to Titus and Erin breaking up, and having both of them hook up with other people within 10 minutes, only to want to get back together.As you can see, this isn't Ozzie and Harriet.  The plots are extremely dark and twisted.  One episode deals with the group having an intervention so that Ken can START drinking again.  In the featurette Hard Laughs on the DVD, Titus confirms what I had pretty much known since I had seen the show; many of the plots barely got network approval.  Chris had to coax them into the episodes by explaining how funny they could be, and believe me, this is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Very few shows on network television have ventured this far in terms of the kinds of stories they do (sure, there's Family Guy, but that's a different kind of edgy).  The people in this show are dysfunctional and real.  There is no weekly reconcilliation at the end of each episode.  In fact, it's lucky if the characters' situations aren't worse off by the end than they were at the beginning.As I said earlier, this show had a tiny budget.  Aside from the three main sets (Titus' house, Ken's house, and the Titus High Performance garage), most of the others were definitely recycled, and it doesn't take too much of a trained eye to see old sets refurbished to look like something new (I'm pretty sure that the police station and the hospital were the same set).  Furthermore, it seemed like they just couldn't hold on to the actors who played recurring characters.  One character was in three episodes, and was played by someone new each time.  Juanita Titus was played by a different actress in each season (although they go into that in Hard Laughs, and it does make a kind of sense if you watch the show).  I'm surprised that they were able to get guest stars like David Hyde Pierce and Jay Leno to appear (although I'm guessing that they enjoyed the material and were willing to take a cut in their normal pay, just like Gary Oldman on Greg the Bunny).  A good number of the episodes dealt only with the main five characters, and didn't have guests at all.As I said earlier, even though this show deserved more than just three seasons, I'm surprised that it got that many.  This is not a show with a big middle ground; most people either love it or hate it, and I'm guessing that there are more people who hate it than love it (although I'm guessing that most people haven't even seen it).  In Hard Laughs, Titus was saying how FOX got numerous angry letters protesting the show, and that a lot of people came up to him to insult him (although, he also said that people come up to him and are angry that the show was cancelled).  Despite everything that this show had going against it though, it did a great job with what it had.  It was hilarious and it was able to remain on the air for three great years.  It really is too bad that it wasn't on longer, with it on DVD now, I hope that more people will appreciate the genius behind this amazing show.",5,"Hilarious and Dark, Yet Killed Before Its

907160,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0009K8LCA,A. Trotter,"[2, 3]","I hate comedy shows. Really. Those classic, popular, amazing comedies? I hate 'em. Those cool, neurotic groups of hysterical personalities? Change the channel in seconds. Don't think I'm prejudging them, either - I've worked shift with people who love those shows, and I've suffered....um, sat through episodes with as non-judgemental an attitude as a Bhuddist monk. And at the end? I was ready to take a butane torch to either the TV or my ears, just to end the pain. (Normal people will be upset by the butane torch comment. Screwed up people, who watch Titus, will laugh and nod.)But despite hating comedy in general, I love this show. I love Christopher Titus, and Erin Fitzpatrick, and Dave, and Tommy, and Papa Titus, and Psycho Mom. I love the whole show. It's terrific. It's a life-affirming, heartwarming, positive take on the fact that even if you were completely screwed up as a kid by your family, you can make fun of it on primetime TV and everyone will laugh at the fact that you set yourself on fire - and then they'll cancel your show.Sorry. I'm halfway through season 3, the sarcasm is catching.HOW COULD THEY CANCEL THIS?!?!? Honestly I don't get it - but I'm so glad it came out on DVD!Ok, on to the actual review. Like most new shows it starts out rough - they're a little uneasy around each other, and it's a little stilted. But it gets better - they get their timing down, it starts to flow, and by the end of season 2 they're really on the ball.The show is about a guy named Christopher Titus, his Irish girlfriend Erin, his not-gay best friend Dave, his completely genetically unrelated brother Tommy (look Tommy, cows!), his very tough dad (Wussy!) and various other relations (Psycho Mom of the many personalities, Crazy Grandma, Amy the...um... no spoilers.)There's drugs, stupidity, cars, alcholoism, abuse, 80's hair, insanity, and loads of parental violence - all  very funny stuff.  Sometimes it's sort of serious, mostly it's not, all of it's terrific.I honestly don't think everybody's going to like it as much as I do.

907161,A2FJDO2LS91OR4,B0009K8LCA,Billy Champarino,"[0, 15]","This is my first review on Amazon.  In fairness to Titus, I usually watch television series that involve drama but do enjoy well written, intelligent, and sometimes crude comedies as well.Titus has 5 star reviews from every reviewer except 1 person whose comments were about the delivery of the product, not the show itself.I only made it through 1 and a half episodes.  Did not laugh at one single joke or comment and feel strongly that this show was terrible. Nothing seemed interesting or intelligent and on top of everything it also has a ""laugh track"" that put me off.It's almost like you are watching a play on television.  The first episode shows Titus talking about his father who Titus thinks is dead because he has not come out of his room in 4 days.The entire episode takes place in the living room and kitchen and it's all conversation.Titus talks to his brother, girlfriend, and friend.  In the end the father comes out of the room.It was painful to watch.I gave it another chance in episode 2 but nothing changed.  This time Titus at least leaves the house and goes to his girlfriend's place of work.  He believes she is flirting with someone and makes unfunny jokes/comments while the laugh track continues to blare.In my opinion, there are far better television comedies to check out (Curb your Enthusiasm, Eastbound and Down, Family Guy) then this show and because of the high ratings, I feel the need to alert anyone who might consider this.",1,Awful,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1459,"['first', 'review', 'Amazon', 'fairness', 'Titus', 'usually', 'watch', 'television', 'series', 'involve', 'drama', 'do', 'enjoy', 'well', 'written', 'intelligent', 'sometimes', 'crude', 'comedies', 'well.Titus', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'reviewer', '1', 'person', 'comments', 'were', 'delivery', 'product', 'not', 'show', 'only', 'made', '1', 'half', 'episodes', 'Did', 'not', 'laugh', 'one', 'single', 'joke', 'comment', 'feel', 'strongly', 'show', 'was', 'terrible', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'top', 'everything', 'also', 'laugh', 'track', 'put', 'off.It', 'almost', 'are', 'watching', 'play', 'television', 'first', 'episode', 'shows', 'Titus', 'talking', 'father', 'who', 'Titus', 'dead', 'not', 'come', 'room', '4', 'days.The', 'entire', 'episode', 'place', 'living', 'room', 'kitchen', 'conversation.Titus', 'talks', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'friend', 'end', 'father', 'room.It', 'was', 'painful', 'watch.I', 'gave', 'chance', 'episode', '2', 'nothing', 'changed', 'time', 'Titus', 'least', 'house', 'girlfriend', 'place', 'work', 'flirting', 'someone', 'unfunny', 'jokes/comments', 'laugh', 'track', 'blare.In', 'opinion', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'television', 'comedies', 'check', 'out', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'Family', 'Guy', 'then', 'show', 'high', 'ratings', 'feel', 'need', 'alert', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'consider']",Titus - Seasons 1 & 2
907162,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B0009K8LCA,Brian A. Schar,"[5, 5]","Every so often, a TV comedy comes along that is truly edgy and different, where you find yourself wincing and thinking ""did he really just say that,"" right before you laugh.  Being edgy and different is not the same thing as being gratuitously offensive and crude, but rather is a function of diving deep into our psyche and our socialization and bringing up the nuggets of comedy hiding there.  For example, ""Titus"" is perhaps the only show in television history where an episode deals with the domestic abuse of a man by his old girlfriend - and it's comedy gold, without being a ""very special episode of Titus""!  ""Titus"" manages to walk the fine line of making light of the emotions and reactions that surround the horrific, without making light of the horrific itself.  Indeed, part of why ""Titus"" is so good is that we get nuggets of dramatic honesty from the characters that make us care about them, and in turn that makes the comedy even funnier.The special features describe how ""Titus"" came to be, and the commentary tracks, unusual for a comedy show, are interesting and informative.The first few episodes are taken directly from Christopher Titus' excellent ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"" comedy show, which is still broadcast from time to time on Comedy Central.  It's well worth watching if you have a chance.  If you like that, you will love this box set.In my opinion, the first two seasons are the best, so this is the box set to get if you're going to get just one.  Although after you buy this, you will buy Season 3 anyway.  Season 3 is still funny, and better than most things on TV today, but the addition of Erin's niece to the cast in season 3 was a less-than-inspired idea that drags down some of those episodes.",5,Too edgy even for Fox,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,1735,"['so', 'often', 'TV', 'comedy', 'truly', 'edgy', 'different', 'where', 'find', 'wincing', 'thinking', 'did', 'really', 'just', 'say', 'right', 'laugh', 'Being', 'edgy', 'different', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'being', 'gratuitously', 'offensive', 'crude', 'rather', 'function', 'diving', 'deep', 'psyche', 'socialization', 'bringing', 'up', 'nuggets', 'comedy', 'hiding', 'there', 'example', 'Titus', 'perhaps', 'only', 'show', 'television', 'history', 'where', 'episode', 'deals', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'man', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'comedy', 'gold', 'being', 'very', 'special', 'episode', 'Titus', 'Titus', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'making', 'light', 'emotions', 'reactions', 'surround', 'horrific', 'making', 'light', 'horrific', 'Indeed', 'part', 'why', 'Titus', 'so', 'good', 'get', 'nuggets', 'dramatic', 'honesty', 'characters', 'make', 'care', 'turn', 'comedy', 'even', 'funnier.The', 'special', 'features', 'describe', 'how', 'Titus', 'came', 'be', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'unusual', 'comedy', 'show', 'are', 'interesting', 'informative.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'excellent', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'Bleeding', 'comedy', 'show', 'still', 'broadcast', 'time', 'time', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'chance', 'like', 'will', 'love', 'box', 'set.In', 'opinion', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'box', 'set', 'get', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'just', 'one', 'buy', 'will', 'buy', 'Season', '3', 'anyway', 'Season', '3', 'still', 'funny', 'better', 'most', 'things', 'TV', 'today', 'addition', 'Erin', 'niece', 'cast', 'season', '3', 'was', 'less-than-inspired', 'idea', 'down', 'episodes']",Titus - Seasons 1 & 2

When we started watching it I found it to be interesting. It's about a guy who was raised with his brother by a father who cannot maintain relationships with woman very well. The main character is Christopher Titus who does these narrations between certain scenes to explain what is going on.

This is tied for my most favorite show because I could not decide between the two, the other being The Simpsons. I grew up with that show and it is STILL going strong! Anyways, went off topic for a moment. Only having 3 seasons, it's a downer knowing there are only 54 episodes, but just like Zack Ward (who does a great job as Dave) said in a interview which is in the extras of the DVD, it was kinda perfect that it only had 54 episodes. That might sound strange to some. I guess you can say Titus is like a shooting star compared to the regular stars in the sky that would represent other shows. Shined twice as bright and stood out, just amazing, but is gone before you know it and most never noticed it at all. I am happy I was able to enjoy Titus while it was on air. Also, most of what happens in the show has actually happened to the comedian Christopher Titus! Probably why it has that strong connection with those that have a twisted sense of humor like myself!Titus is about a guy named Christopher Titus who narrates the show about his life in a room shot in black and white that is called the neutral space. Titus owns and runs a Hot Rod garage shop and works with his flamboyant (yet not gay) best friend Tommy, who can be anal at times, and his adopted brother Dave who can be quite the dimwitted pot head who is hilarious! He lives with his gorgeous girlfriend Erin who tries her best to be normal besides the fact that she grew up in a crazy disfunctional family just like Titus. Probably why she gets him and they do so well together. (Err.... um.... well up to a point. watch the seasons first before you watch Christopher Titus' stand up special Love is Evol) lol. Last, but not least, you have Papa Titus A.K.A Ken Titus who is a alcoholic womanizer that will having you laugh your a** off the most! He is the definition of tough love when we see flashbacks of him raising his sons Chris and Dave. That's also another thing in the show, flashbacks to Titus childhood, high school years, and past stories will come up during the show delivering lots of laughs! One example would be when we see Titus as a kid and he walks up to Papa Titus who is sitting in his chair and is watching tv. &#34;Daddy, my teacher said that we can grow up to be anything we want to be!&#34; and Papa Titus with a beer in hand &#34;He obviously wasn't talking to you son, now go in the back yard and start practicing digging trenches&#34; Just a taste of this great funny dark humored show!Titus Seasons 1 & 2 have some great episodes! (season 2 has most of my favs) well they all are great, some I would say, are the top episodes like Perfect Thanksgiving, The Pit, The Pendulum, The Last Noelle, Dad's Dead, Dave moves out, and many more! Special features include interviews with some of the cast members, blooper reels, and audio commentary on some episodes. If you have a wicked sense of humor, GET THIS! you will not be dissapointed!

Each episode begins as Titus is inside a closet giving a monologue and telling flashbacks of his high school days in the 80s.  It is hilarious seeing him protray his youth.  The rest of the episode involves some of the best comedy on television.

Lots of comedies these days get their laughs by referencing things the viewer might be familiar with (See: The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Frasier, Murphy Brown) or by relying on cliche's about people (Home Improvements, Everybody Loves Raymond).Titus was a throwback-- a character driven sitcom in the mold of The Honeymooners or the Drew Carey Show.  Their world is smallish-- it revolves around a handful of people (Christopher and his girlfriend, half brother, best friend and father).  The characters are exaggerated just enough to highlight life's foibles, but not enough to be completely ridiculous (""Soup Nazi"" anyone?)Beyond that, the writing is tight, sharp, and clever.  But it's not a self-aware cleverness-- not one that pokes you in the ribs and says ""SEE HOW SMART OUR WRITERS ARE?""That was probably it's undoing.As Philip J Frie said of television in Futurama:  ""Clever things make people feel stupid.""  He's right on the money.  TV shows that are smart AND subtle about it don't make the cut-- just ask Barry Sonnenfeld about The Tick.But enough soapboxing.  The show is extremely well paced.  The key to comedy, as many have said before, is timing.  And the timing is absolutely superb in Titus.  Just watch ""Dad's Dead"" if you want to see comic timing done well.

Based on the one-man show NORMAN ROCKWELL IS BLEEDING, written and performed by the show's star, comedian Christopher Titus, this was one of the funniest shows the Fox network ever put on the air. Christopher Titus plays the title character, who guides us through his screwed-up life accompanied by his half-crazy half brother Dave, incredibly anal best friend Tommy, equally screwed-up but loving fiancee Erin, and his unbelieveably tough-loving, hard-drinking, chain-smoking, but responsible father, Ken, who's been married five times, along with occasional visits from his manic-depressive schizophrenic mother.These don't sound like the ingredients of a laugh-out-loud comedy, but the fact is, this show is hilarious. Some people may be offended by the content, but that's a good thing. There is nothing PC about this show, and it's hysterical because of this. The ""blank space"" monologues of Titus himself and frequent flashbacks that occur during the show round out the stories perfectly and add to the humor tremendously.

Each episode is narrated by Titus from his ""neutral space"" who offers some side-splitting comments and humorous flashbacks from his childhood and teenage years. The comedy series features some great humor, well developed interaction, memorable situations and good comic performances.

907182,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0009K8LCA,Robert I. Hedges,"[19, 19]","I do not watch much television, probably less than an hour a week on average. One of the extremely rare series that I sought out was ""Titus,"" a masterwork which was cancelled before its time, after three short, but brilliant, years. Most good comedy comes out of tragedy, and certainly Christopher Titus has had more than his share. His father was serially divorced, his mother was insane and later committed suicide, yet he was able to take that personal pain and turn it into a darkly funny stand-up act, and later this show.This show broke new ground, and Fox was brave to let the show explore taboo areas such as divorce, abuse, insanity, and general familial dysfunction. The writing, direction, cinematography (it was the first show in High Definition), and most of all acting are perfect. Christopher Titus plays himself, the beautiful Cynthia Watros plays Erin, his girlfriend, and best of all Stacey Keach plays his dad. For my money Keach as Ken Titus is one of the greatest performances ever in prime time. The remaining cast is equally brilliant, and the guest stars (David Hyde Pierce, Jay Leno, etc.) are delightful.The show is unique in its construction, and the black and white narrated segments are some of the best scenes ever filmed. Most are very funny, though some are powerful social commentary (a trend that became even more pronounced in season three.)This show is truly unique: it takes situation comedy to a totally new level, and while it sometimes makes the viewer uncomfortable, it also challenges the viewer to look at themselves, their own fears, biases, and prejudices, and in the final analysis that's a good thing.I can't recommend ""Titus"" highly enough.
