The main character falls in love with any woman who catches his eye and in one case is so attracted to a pair of legs that he seeks out the woman with a very devious - but innocent - system that will ring true to many a romantic Casanova. the man is so obsessed by women - never in a bad way - that he decides to explore his feelings through a book. as he looks for the publisher he ends up finding t=yet another interest.  the film, however, in no way presents women in a degrading way and is very thoughtful in its respect of women in fact.

It is so well made, so well told, that it leaves me merely with a sense of completeness. There is no real ""plot"", and it is senseless to give a pedestrian outline of what does or does not happen. I must have seen it when it came out, perhaps about 1977, and have not been able to forget it. It is, somehow, a perfectly made presentation of one man's life: insignificant yet universal, simultaneously realistic, surrealistic, artistic, fantastic, true yet imaginative. I was staggered to see that an apparently bone-headed remake by Blake Edwards, a clumsy and insensitive film-maker --- think of what a misuse of Peter Sellers' talents the Pink Panther series was! --- had attempted either to spoof it, or to exploit it. Well, I haven't seen his remake, but I can imagine it as the crudest possible American bludgeoning of French finesse.

And that's most of what happens in this amusing film by one of the great film directors. Morane is likeable and perhaps lovable and certainly is never cruel to the women he meets. He just is determined to continue making notches on his gun. There is some indication that he was hurt when Vera (Leslie Caron) broke up with him four, five years ago although we are never completely sure-- at least I wasn't-- as to why he seeks quantity over quality. Certainly, however, the women he gets involved with, if just for a night, are for the most part lookers.The movie is beautifully filmed as we see frame after frame of women's gorgeous legs for Morane sees them everywhere.

The story begins by showing the length he will go to track down an elusive beauty, then spins a wonderful array of thoughts and observations on the nature of relationships as Bertrand tries to come to terms with his obsession.  This leads him to pen a book that more or less forms the backbone of the movie as he drifts back in time to chart some of his early relationships, including the Oedipal one with his mother.  However, the movie maintains a firm focus in the present, ultimately leading to an engaging relationship with his editor.  Along the way there is the playful banter between Bertrand and the operator who provides wake up calls each morning; an older woman who runs a lingerie shop at which Bertrand gazes at the new window displays; and a couple of relationships from the past which come back to haunt him.  Unlike the 1983 remake featuring Burt Reynolds, this movie doesn't devolve into middle age angst.  Bertrand is modest and relatively honest with himself, which is what ultimately wins over his editor.  The only problem is that Bertrand still has one woman that has managed to elude him leading to a fateful closing scene where he rushs headlong into traffic after the perfect pair of legs.",5,The womanizer,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,1319,"['Charles', 'Denner', 'seemingly', 'mild', 'mannered', 'engineer', 'who', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'beautiful', 'women', 'story', 'showing', 'length', 'will', 'go', 'track', 'down', 'elusive', 'beauty', 'then', 'wonderful', 'array', 'thoughts', 'observations', 'nature', 'relationships', 'Bertrand', 'come', 'terms', 'obsession', 'pen', 'book', 'more', 'less', 'forms', 'backbone', 'movie', 'back', 'time', 'chart', 'early', 'relationships', 'including', 'Oedipal', 'one', 'mother', 'However', 'movie', 'firm', 'focus', 'present', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'engaging', 'relationship', 'editor', 'way', 'playful', 'banter', 'Bertrand', 'operator', 'who', 'wake', 'up', 'calls', 'morning', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'lingerie', 'shop', 'Bertrand', 'new', 'window', 'displays', 'couple', 'relationships', 'past', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', '1983', 'remake', 'featuring', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'movie', ""n't"", 'devolve', 'middle', 'age', 'angst', 'Bertrand', 'modest', 'relatively', 'honest', 'what', 'ultimately', 'editor', 'only', 'problem', 'Bertrand', 'still', 'one', 'woman', 'managed', 'elude', 'leading', 'fateful', 'closing', 'scene', 'where', 'rushs', 'headlong', 'traffic', 'perfect', 'pair', 'legs']",N/A

And yet his persistence, frankness, and attentiveness to the physical attributes of the various women he encounters--played by Fossey, Natalie Baye, and Nelly Borgeaud--result in his becoming a rather roguish ladies' man. Denner--unsmiling, helplessly leering, yet somehow charming--was a perfect choice for the role, and there's a lot more to the story than conquest. As Bertrand writes about his life, he discovers dissatisfaction at the heart of his enterprise, a revelation Truffaut turns into bittersweet irony.

Movies never do, of course, but at times ""The Man Who Loved Women"" is so side-splittingly funny that you kind of wish you were in a movie theatre with a bunch of people roaring with laughter, rather than just sitting at home watching a DVD.But then again, the main character is not funny but really creepy.  Or is he?  Is he a heartbreaker, or just a victim himself?  The film's director, the brilliant Franois Truffaut, doesn't tip his hand.The story concerns a 40-something aerodynamics engineer who lives in the beautiful French town of Montpellier.  The movie is set in, and was made in, the mid 1970's.  The main character has a long string of empty, meaningless trysts.  But there's something more to him than just that, as he fancies himself a philosopher of women and of love.  Oddly and counterintuitively, he becomes a sympathetic and intriguing character--but only partially--as the movie moves towards its conclusion.As other reviewers have mentioned, the movie seems as light and simple as a souffl&eacute;, but there's actually a lot going on.  On the witness stand, throughout the movie as it turns out, is the question of ""Does everyone need to be loved?""  Truffaut, in a very subtle and almost invisible way, weighs in.Note: this movie is very heavy on conversation and very light on action.  It's also very subtle, almost quiet.
