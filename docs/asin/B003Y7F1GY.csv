Some can quickly move on with their lives while others let the death of a loved one become the death of themselves. the film also shows how helpless one can feel when a friend is in such a profound state of grief.

1375901,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y7F1GY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","A serious attempt to dramatize loss and lingering grief, ""Against the Current"" may be embraced by viewers for its universal themes and serious tone. Writer and director Peter Callahan has assembled a grown-up and well meaning film, but good intentions don't always translate to great film. While I appreciate the subject matter, respect the film's intent and those who may find it identifiable, and feel there is lots to recommend within this piece--it ultimately falls a little short dramatically. Those who love this film will probably tear me apart, but I ended up being a little disconnected and emotionally distant from a film that is essentially about feeling and caring. And that's unfortunate--because I wanted to love ""Against the Current.""Joseph Fiennes plays a widower still reeling from the death of his wife and unborn child years previously. Nearing the fifth year anniversary, he embarks on a crazy quest to swim the length of the Hudson River. Enlisting his closest friend (Justin Kirk) and, rather arbitrarily, a random acquaintance (Elizabeth Reaser)--they set off on an adventure. That's really about all--the film fleshes out the dynamics of this threesome with relative success while they share various moments along the way. The largest diversion is at Reaser's family home with some comedic mayhem provided by Mary Tyler Moore. This section, while sporadically funny, appears as if out of another film altogether. The shifting tone is both one of the film's strongest attributes and one of its primary weaknesses. Reaser is lovely and appealing and lightens things up quite a bit and Kirk has his wisecracking shtick down pat. I appreciated the interplay between Kirk and Fiennes and found them quite believable as lifelong friends.Ultimately, though, I think the film telegraphs its emotional cues too visibly. The copious swimming scenes highlight an isolated Fiennes stroking along to a soundtrack of melancholy singles--it's like Lilith Fair at sea. Once, early on his journey, he's asked if he has a permit for this sojourn (something, as a realist, which was also my first question)--of course, he doesn't. So when Fiennes starts swimming next to factories, cargo barges, cruise ships, and the Statue of Liberty--I got a little ""iffy"" as to how the authorities weren't getting involved. Those scenes, however, were used as emotional shortcuts to demonstrate how small and inconsequential Fiennes appeared. Then we have Fiennes, a good actor that gets more and more serious and dour as the years roll by. In ""Against the Current,"" Fiennes' performance is relatively one note and inexpressive which seems to symbolize grief--but which left me a bit empty. I think that if you connect personally with ""Against the Current,"" you will embrace it wholeheartedly despite its shortcomings. I, however, wanted to feel more when the credits rolled.

It slowly began to revele itself as a beautiful reflective film. I also really enjoyed Justin Kirk's performance. He brought some much needed humor to this movie that deals with some heavy subject matter. There were also some beautiful shots of the Hudson River (although the shots of him swimming in the river got kinda boring after the first few). Good movie I would definitely recommend to people.,3,"Good, Reflective Film",1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,512,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'whole', 'story', 'bit', 'slow', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'slowly', 'began', 'revele', 'beautiful', 'reflective', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'performance', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'humor', 'movie', 'deals', 'heavy', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'also', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'Hudson', 'River', 'shots', 'swimming', 'river', 'got', 'kinda', 'boring', 'first', 'few', 'Good', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'people']",N/A

1375904,A13D4E28S63SYF,B003Y7F1GY,"Ron ""true faith""","[5, 7]","This is truly a heartfelt film.  It will force you to look deep into your soul and question the pains of depression.  Did you ever have someone you loved, who then died suddenly?  How long were you depressed?  A year?  Two years?  Five years?  Do you ever get over a loved one who you have lost?  Based on my experience--no, you don't.  Anyway, this is pretty much what AGAINST THE CURRENT is about.  Before Paul lost his wife and daughter, he told his wife that one day he would swim down the entire length (approx. 150 miles) of the Hudson River.  Close to the 5th anniversary of his wife's (and daughter) death, he decides to take the plunge.  He rounds up his two friends, Jeff and Liz.  They will ride in a boat alongside Paul while he swims.  I don't want to spoil the rest for you so I will stop here.  As I said before, this is a brilliant film.  The writing and directing are top notch.  Justin Kirk was perfect for his role as Jeff.  He displayed the right amount of sarcasm and sympathy.  The same goes for Elizabeth Reaser as Liz.  She had terrific chemistry with Paul.  But the star of the film was Joseph Fiennes as Paul.  I always thought Fiennes was at his best when he portrayed introspective characters, such as William Shakespeare and Robert Dudley.  His performance in this film is no exception.  This is his best performance in a long time.  In conclusion I would just like to say that I think it's ridiculous that more people will not have the opportunity to see this fine film in the cinema unlike those of us who saw it at a film festival.  I find it amazing that excellent films like AGAINST THE CURRENT are going straight to DVD while lousy films are being shown at the cinema.  And there were a lot of losers at the cinema this year.  Oh, well--I guess I should be glad that it will be coming out on DVD.

1375905,ABBIURWJFRZKJ,B003Y7F1GY,Stephen Foster,"[4, 7]","(I don't think I've given a 1-star review in perhaps ten years.)I so desperately wanted to see this movie. I spent the happiest years of my life running a research fishing boat up and down the Hudson River, and I was really looking forward to seeing those old hunting grounds again.There were even enticing early shots of the landscape I loved: a mile-long train chugging its way along the base of the Palisades; a Moran tug with a bone in its teeth... I turned it off twenty five minutes in, with a sad sigh, but then I turned it back on, to write this review, so you OWE ME, big-time.There are three main characters, and perhaps one of them makes sense, but I doubt it. And then later there's the horror of Mary Tyler Moore showing up, a stunningly-good actress (seeOrdinary People) who hopefully made her casting decision because she needed a new refrigerator that day.And then Michelle Trachtenberg shows up, quickly getting the confused hero on his own and frantically instructing him to taste her, no doubt as an appetizer.Two more things. The swimming is utterly fake: for camera recognition, Fiennes swims with his entire upper torso out of the water at all times, which is only possible in movieland.And why is the film called ""Against the Current""? He swims the entire movie WITH the current.You can tell I'm just reacting, not actually describing the movie, but if you want to watch it, please do so, then come back here and leave a comment telling me my assessment is wrong, OK?",1,What's that persistent clunking noise?

1375906,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B003Y7F1GY,susannah,"[3, 4]","SPOILERS....SPOILERS...SPOILERSThis film definitely is effecting, and very beautifully shot. I liked seeing the changing scenery on the riverbanks from the point of view of being in the water. The movie contained alot of humor, and it was delivered naturally and realistically.The scenes with Mary Tyler Moore were funny but uncomfortable as well, giving me a sense on one hand that whoever she was addressing was a sort of trapped insect that she could crush without a second thought, yet on another, sometimes seeming as though she would be quite shocked that anyone would think her malicious. I think her daughter was the permanently trapped insect.I thought that in their own ways, Jeff and Liz were just as lost as Paul was, as in Liz's case, with a mother who never really saw her or listened to her. We hear that Jeff's parents are also very wealthy and similarly uninterested/disappointed in him. Other than this, the characters are not very well developed, to the film's detriment.The film did stretch believability quite a bit. One day a guy decides to swim 140 miles of the river, and so he jumps in a wetsuit and off he goes, with no training whatsoever, and despite swimming miles each day, never appears to be even tired, let alone sore and exhausted. Even professional swimmers have to train for endurance events. I thought it was funny that in the last scenes after getting out of the water, his hair was dry.I have to say that you would have to go far to find someone more self absorbed and selfish than Paul. I understood that he was grieving, but as Liz pointed out in a great scene, everyone suffers, everyone loses those that they love, and most people find a way to go on. There are others who cling to their grief and refuse to move past it, and I believe for these people it becomes more narcissism than grief, a thinking only about self, and a complete lack of consideration or empathy for anyone around them, let alone being about the lost loved ones.  Paul exhibited that lack of consideration when he completely dismissed Jeff's years long friendship and the pain it would cause him if Paul died. Paul started a relationship with Liz, giving her false hope, when he had every intention of leaving her. The final scenes, when he did what he did IN FRONT of them, were shocking to me, that anyone could be so brutal and horribly insensitive to those  he supposedly cared about.The film was supposed to be about the ravages of grief and pain but to me it showed more the grief and pain Paul inflicted than what he felt.Three stars for a movie that has a very interesting, thought provoking premise, and as I said, beautifully filmed. It could have been much better with more character development.",3,Moving..but..,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,2722,"['SPOILERS', '.SPOILERS', 'SPOILERSThis', 'film', 'definitely', 'effecting', 'very', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'liked', 'seeing', 'changing', 'scenery', 'riverbanks', 'point', 'view', 'being', 'water', 'movie', 'contained', 'alot', 'humor', 'was', 'delivered', 'naturally', 'realistically.The', 'scenes', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'were', 'funny', 'uncomfortable', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'sense', 'one', 'hand', 'whoever', 'was', 'addressing', 'was', 'sort', 'trapped', 'insect', 'could', 'crush', 'second', 'thought', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'seeming', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'shocked', 'anyone', 'would', 'think', 'malicious', 'think', 'daughter', 'was', 'permanently', 'trapped', 'insect.I', 'thought', 'own', 'ways', 'Jeff', 'Liz', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'Paul', 'was', 'Liz', 'case', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'listened', 'hear', 'Jeff', 'parents', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'wealthy', 'similarly', 'uninterested/disappointed', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'film', 'detriment.The', 'film', 'did', 'stretch', 'believability', 'quite', 'bit', 'One', 'day', 'guy', 'swim', '140', 'miles', 'river', 'so', 'wetsuit', 'training', 'whatsoever', 'swimming', 'miles', 'day', 'never', 'be', 'even', 'tired', 'let', 'alone', 'sore', 'exhausted', 'Even', 'professional', 'swimmers', 'have', 'train', 'endurance', 'events', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'last', 'scenes', 'getting', 'water', 'hair', 'was', 'dry.I', 'have', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'far', 'find', 'someone', 'more', 'self', 'absorbed', 'selfish', 'Paul', 'understood', 'was', 'grieving', 'Liz', 'pointed', 'out', 'great', 'scene', 'everyone', 'suffers', 'everyone', 'love', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'way', 'go', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'cling', 'grief', 'refuse', 'move', 'believe', 'people', 'more', 'narcissism', 'grief', 'thinking', 'only', 'self', 'complete', 'lack', 'consideration', 'empathy', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'being', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'Paul', 'exhibited', 'lack', 'consideration', 'when', 'completely', 'dismissed', 'Jeff', 'years', 'long', 'friendship', 'pain', 'would', 'cause', 'Paul', 'died', 'Paul', 'started', 'relationship', 'Liz', 'giving', 'false', 'hope', 'when', 'had', 'intention', 'leaving', 'final', 'scenes', 'when', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'IN', 'FRONT', 'were', 'shocking', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'brutal', 'horribly', 'insensitive', 'supposedly', 'cared', 'about.The', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'ravages', 'grief', 'pain', 'showed', 'more', 'grief', 'pain', 'Paul', 'inflicted', 'what', 'stars', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'premise', 'said', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'character', 'development']",N/A
