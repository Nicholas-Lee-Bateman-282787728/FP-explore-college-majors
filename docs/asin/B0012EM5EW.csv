The fashions of the 1970s, for example, particularly the mid- to late-'70s, lingered in the air for a big chunk of the '80s, notably in films and on TV.  The first season of the tongue-in-cheek crime drama ""Matlock"" is a great example: even though it aired in 1986-87, the show oozed a 'Seventies sensibility, from the onscreen fashion and acting, to the very feel of the show itself. Partly this is because the show was clearly an homage to many of the offbeat police dramas that came before it -- ""Columbo"", ""McCloud,"" etc. -- along with a whiff of the mildly risque hanky-panky of '70s romance shows such as ""Love Boat,"" etc.""Matlock"" is a delightfully formulaic series, with Andy Griffith playing a doddering but undefeatable Southern ""country"" lawyer who commands big fees and wins big cases. His sidekicks include his spunky but sometimes naive daughter and a semi-retired, self-deprecating private eye who provides some ""Magnum""-style muscle.  The bad guys include various staple figures of '80s TV --  slightly sleazy swingers, smug yuppie types, corrupt establishment figures, etc.  The acting is stiff, the pacing of the show is almost lethargic by today's standards, the plot twists come 'round the bend like an old, slow freight train.  And that's part of the charm. The show feels like a pair of old, comfortable shoes --  Also fun is watching  the show find its legs, as all first-season shows must, and the writers, actors and producers figure out what works and how the show will define itself.Fans of the series will be delighted to see this finally out on DVD; newcomers will also enjoy it as a trip down memory lane... even if they weren't there the first time around!

Compared with some of the other crime series of this era, such as ""Murder She Wrote"", the scripts of ""Matlock"" are incredibly lame - the mysteries are terrible (not enough clues are given, and Matlock frequently solves them by pulling some piece of evidence out of nowhere at the last minute) and Matlock often seems to win his cases because the District Attorney is absolutely incompetent, for example, never objecting even though it is blatantly obvious that he should be. ""Matlock"" is redeemed, however, by the charisma of the main actors. Although Linda Purl, as Matlock's daughter Charlene, has about as much personality as a clothes horse (something which the makers of this series must have noticed, since she vanishes several episodes before the end of this season), Andy Griffith and Kene Holliday (as private investigator Tyler Hudson) both have more than enough personality to compensate and make this series worth watching.This DVD set includes the 23 first season episodes of ""Matlock"", along with the tele-movie ""Diary of a Perfect Murder"", which serves as a pilot to this series (and features a different actress as Matlock's daughter).",3,"Bad writing, saved by the presence of Andy Griffith",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1369,"['Matlock', 'yet', 'one', 'multitude', 'crime', 'series', 'surfaced', '1980', 'time', 'taking', 'form', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'high-priced', 'Southern', 'lawyer', 'Ben', 'Matlock', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'detective', 'Compared', 'other', 'crime', 'series', 'era', 'such', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'scripts', 'Matlock', 'are', 'incredibly', 'lame', 'mysteries', 'are', 'terrible', 'not', 'enough', 'clues', 'are', 'given', 'Matlock', 'frequently', 'pulling', 'piece', 'evidence', 'nowhere', 'last', 'minute', 'Matlock', 'often', 'win', 'cases', 'District', 'Attorney', 'absolutely', 'incompetent', 'example', 'never', 'objecting', 'even', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'should', 'be', 'Matlock', 'redeemed', 'however', 'charisma', 'main', 'actors', 'Linda', 'Purl', 'Matlock', 'daughter', 'Charlene', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'personality', 'clothes', 'horse', 'something', 'makers', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'noticed', 'several', 'episodes', 'end', 'season', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Kene', 'Holliday', 'private', 'investigator', 'Tyler', 'Hudson', 'have', 'more', 'enough', 'personality', 'compensate', 'make', 'series', 'watching.This', 'DVD', 'set', '23', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'Matlock', 'tele-movie', 'Diary', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'pilot', 'series', 'different', 'actress', 'Matlock', 'daughter']",Matlock: Season 1

So let's forget all we know about the long run of this series and just talk about its premiere season.Years after his run as Sheriff Andy Taylor, Andy Griffith finally got another regular job.  This time he is playing Ben Matlock, an Atlanta lawyer who talks like Sheriff Andy.  It's a comfortable role in a tried and true format; a mix of ""Perry Mason"" and ""Columbo"".  ""Columbo"" veteran Dean Hargrove dreamed up the series and shared executive producer duties with Fred Silverman.The focus is on the title character and Griffith is great fun to watch.  He charms and sweet talks his way through each case, getting everyone to let down their guard because they underestimate this good old boy as much as they did the seemingly scatterbrained ""Columbo"".  Both series revolved around the main character's ability discern something incriminating in seemingly innocent little things and to pick up on a guilty party's casual slip of the tongue.In the ""Perry Mason"" tradition Matlock is not bound by the conventional rules of evidence or procedural requirements once he gets into a courtroom.  He can say anything and introduce any sort of evidence simply by reassuring the judge that his line or questioning will eventually become relevant.  Be prepared for the obligatory breakdowns and confessions on the witness stand.  The prosecutors can only shake their heads and bluster helplessly in the face of Matlock's cunning strategy.Matlock is assisted by the show's version of Perry Mason's Paul and Della.  In season one these are his daughter and partner Charlene Matlock (Lori Lethin in the pilot-Linda Purl in the regular episodes) and his investigator Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday).  His junior partner Michele Thomas (Nancy Stafford) would not join the team as a regular until the next season and it wasn't until 1988 that Don Knotts reprised his Barney role as Ben's neighbor Les ""Ace"" Calhoun.Season One's episodes #6 and #7 (a two part story titled ""The Don"") featured William Conrad as District Attorney James ""Fatman"" McShane.  The  next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series ""Jake and the Fatman"".Then again, what do I know?

I was in my mid 30's at the time and I counted ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Matlock"" as among my favorite shows.  I had a friend in the advertising business in New York City at the time and he would just shake his head and chuckle when I told him what I liked to watch.  In any event several months ago I purchased ""Matlock:  The First Season"". I have just now completed viewing all 24 episodes.  Simply marvelous!Without a doubt Andy Griffith had the Ben Matlock character down pat from the get-go. He is certainly the guy I would want defending me should the need ever arise.  I love the Tyler Hudson character played by Kene Holliday as well.  He sure gets himself into a lot of interesting scrapes during the inaugural season. I guess if you are a private investigator it just goes with the territory.  Meanwhile, Linda Purl proves to be nothing special as Ben's daughter Charlene and it easy to see why the character was dropped after season one. She is seen less and less as the season wears on.  But having said that I enjoyed each and every one of these 24 episodes.  My favorite?  You guessed it......""The Judge"" with special guest star Dick Van Dyke.  Am I still stuck in the Sixties or what???  Among my other favorite episodes from Matlock:  The First Season"" are ""The Sisters"", ""The Professor"" and most especially ""The People vs. Matlock"".What is so great about ""Matlock"" is that you can enjoy the program with your wife, your children, friends or with your elderly parents.  There is minimal violence and lots of humor and language is never an issue.  For me the bottom line is that ""Matlock:  The First Season"" is great family entertainment.

I have owned multiple copies of this and several of them had broken clips that hold the disc in place, they also all have very wavy, wrinkled looking plastic on the front cover which in my opinion looks defective.  As I stated I have purchased several copies of this trying to find one without this issue and have had no luck.  The picture quality is also pretty poor in some episodes (fortunately it is only terrible in a few episodes).  There were 2-3 episodes that had magnetic lines at the top like when a VHS tape has tracking issues which lead me to believe the tape masters used were not in good condition.
