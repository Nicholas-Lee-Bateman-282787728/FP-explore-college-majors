My husband is now a PFC in the Army, and was in good shape before even starting this DVD, but I was more than 200 pounds and in very poor shape after gaining 70 pounds with my pregnancy. As challenging as this program was I knew right away that it was working to improve my body, strength, endurance and stamina. The next couple of days I was stiff and could feel in all my muscles that this truly was a full body workout and I loved tightening my muscles and really feeling how much I had worked them. I became confident from that point that I would see the kind of results I really needed to be healthier and make sure I am around for my daughter for years to come. I am now 170 pounds with the help of this program, coupled with a much healthier diet and added support of supplements (Hydroxycut, protein shakes). I really think that this can be a life changing program as long as you stick to it and really do the exercises they are telling you to do. You're in your own home, so you really have to be the one pushing yourself because no one is going to tell you that you are slacking off or to try harder. That drive and determination has to come from you or you will end up quitting before you see any real results.

1109052,A3T2G352GLIEZZ,B000WEVGHK,"The Legend Of Megadon ""MEGAN""","[2, 3]","I really debated giving this 5 stars I decided 4 was best. I will explain why. There are 5 segments a warm up, levels 1,2,3 workouts and a cool down. I think the warm up was lacking a bit though. That can easily be solved by jogging in place for a few mintes before starting the workout. The first workout level one is instructed by Jillian and is very good but I did not think there was enough focus on the abs. It is 20 mins. long. I was not tired at all afterwards. There were basics such as squats and lunges combined with handweight exercises. It was tough but if your an advanced exerciser you may want to do level 2 and 3 after level one. Level 2 is instructed by Kim she basically does a 10 mintue segment that most of the exercises are the same but a more advanced version of the ones Jillian did. Side lunges, rows the ab exericses are done sitting up with weights whch is a nice change. Level 3 is instructed by Bob. This is the one that had me sweating there are some exercises involving hand weights and then you go to the floor doing planks and holding them for a long time which gets you sweating. He also has you hold yourself up in a pushup position and that was the killer. The cool down is instructed by Jillan and is basic stretching. The reason this got 4 stars instead of five is this the last 2 workout were not long enough. I dont know may people who can workout for 10 mintues and lose weight. That can be remieded by repeating them. If your out of shape or in a plateau this will work great for you. This is supposed to be a 6 week program where for the frst 2 weeks you do level 1 the next 2 weeks you do level 2 and the last 2 weeks you do level 3. If your like me and gain weight easily and have a sluggish metabolism I suggest you do all 3 levels at every workout. This is a great dvd but like I said the last 2 workouts just are not long enough and that is why I gave it 4 stars. There needs to be a little more to each of those last 2 weokouts. I reccomend buying this and using it but just do all 3 or when you get to levels 2 and 3 I suggest you do the 10 min. segments twice.",4,Big Winner,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2110,"['really', 'debated', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'decided', '4', 'was', 'best', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'are', '5', 'segments', 'warm', 'up', 'levels', '1,2,3', 'workouts', 'cool', 'down', 'think', 'warm', 'up', 'was', 'lacking', 'bit', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'solved', 'jogging', 'place', 'few', 'mintes', 'starting', 'workout', 'first', 'workout', 'level', 'one', 'instructed', 'Jillian', 'very', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'enough', 'focus', 'abs', '20', 'mins', 'long', 'was', 'not', 'tired', 'afterwards', 'were', 'basics', 'such', 'squats', 'lunges', 'combined', 'handweight', 'exercises', 'was', 'tough', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'may', 'want', 'do', 'level', '2', '3', 'level', 'one', 'Level', '2', 'instructed', 'Kim', 'basically', '10', 'mintue', 'segment', 'most', 'exercises', 'are', 'same', 'more', 'advanced', 'version', 'ones', 'Jillian', 'did', 'Side', 'lunges', 'ab', 'exericses', 'are', 'done', 'sitting', 'up', 'weights', 'nice', 'change', 'Level', '3', 'instructed', 'Bob', 'one', 'had', 'sweating', 'are', 'exercises', 'involving', 'hand', 'weights', 'then', 'go', 'floor', 'doing', 'planks', 'holding', 'long', 'time', 'sweating', 'also', 'hold', 'up', 'pushup', 'position', 'was', 'killer', 'cool', 'down', 'instructed', 'Jillan', 'basic', 'stretching', 'reason', 'got', '4', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'last', '2', 'workout', 'were', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'dont', 'know', 'may', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'workout', '10', 'mintues', 'lose', 'weight', 'can', 'be', 'remieded', 'repeating', 'shape', 'plateau', 'will', 'work', 'great', 'supposed', 'be', '6', 'week', 'program', 'where', 'frst', '2', 'weeks', 'do', 'level', '1', 'next', '2', 'weeks', 'do', 'level', '2', 'last', '2', 'weeks', 'do', 'level', '3', 'gain', 'weight', 'easily', 'have', 'sluggish', 'metabolism', 'suggest', 'do', '3', 'levels', 'workout', 'great', 'dvd', 'said', 'last', '2', 'workouts', 'just', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'last', '2', 'weokouts', 'reccomend', 'buying', 'using', 'just', 'do', '3', 'when', 'get', 'levels', '2', '3', 'suggest', 'do', '10', 'min', 'segments', 'twice']",Biggest Loser Power Sculpt

It follows the same method, with three levels of intensity and the ability to mix-or-match with the remote to get the workout you want.  This is good.Like Cardio Max, the Level 1 is 20 minutes and the Level 2 and 3 are 10 minutes each.  On the Cardio Max, Jillian's Level 2 segment was my least favorite, and the one I am most likely to skip.  Here, she takes over the longer 20 minute Level 1 workout.  This is bad.The real problem with Jillian is that she doesn't seem to know how to make a workout DVD. She spends too much time explaining and correcting form, teasing the cast, and just chatting in general.  Now, if I was taking a class from her, that would be great. If it was just a TV show, things would be fine.  But this is a workout DVD, meant to be watched/used over and over again, and when she stops the exercise in order to correct someone's form, or in order to explain a particular exercise, it brings the whole thing to a screeching halt.I have owned other workout DVDs where semi-complicated forms were explained in a separate training segment so that the overall momentum of the workout wasn't affected.  That doesn't happen here.  Jillian stops the workout every single time in the same spot, and it is frustrating and annoying.I can't say that this DVD is a total loss.  I have learned to just carry on over top of her instructions, and you can set it to music only without the instructor's voice, but it just seems like this should be a better production, and that the director should have said something or done something to keep the flow going.",3,Jillian talks too much.
