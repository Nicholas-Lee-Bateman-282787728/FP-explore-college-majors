A comedy about a tragedy, it does cancer right, how many  films can make the dreaded disease funny?Joseph Gordon Levitt is Adam Lerner, a radio producer who lives life carefully, waiting for the walk sign, no smoking or drinking and tragically gets a rare type of cancer in his spinal cord. The film follows his comic tragic struggle with him during the various stages of grief. He has a girlfriend Rachael ( Bryce Dallas Howard) but she is unable and inept to take care of her beau. His best friend Kyle ( Rogen), proves his friendship, but often using his friends disease to pick up ladies. Will Reiser wrote the script based on his own struggles with the disease. The cast is great, especially, Anjelica Huston who is neurotic as Lerner's mom.

It's about a purpose in life, about the people and relationships we fill it with. It's about making meaningful actions but accepting the human struggles we all experience. As much as this is Mr. Levitt's journey, perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this film is seeing the complex 3 dimensional ways that his cancer impacts everyone around him, especially Seth Rogen's character. Infused with the awkward and painful comedy of our current era (Forgetting Sarah Marshall & Funny People; Though 50/50 is much more accessible than the latter) that brings the comedy out of everyday truth, this tale is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. In that way, I find it to be a masterful representation of life. I take a voyeuristic approach to movies emotionally, and I love when a film can not only show you, but allow you experience those things that you don't get to experience in your everyday life, but teach you something about yourself, leaving you with a takeaway for your own life. I think it's important to face our own mortality, though it's preferable to do so before we're all invariably forced to. It's a beautiful film.

1424524,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004QL7KKC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Having read a lot of reviews for this film when it was first released, unlike so many other reviewers here, I knew what to expect.  Having been penned by Will Reiser, who happened to beat cancer himself, `50/50' is laced with a touch of humanity and honesty that really sets it apart from the usual Seth Rogen fare.  It feels earnest and its intentions are pure and because of that the obvious faults (those Hollywood clich&eacute;s and a generally terribly written `character') seem to be easily forgiven.So yeah, `50/50' isn't perfect by any means, but it tries hard enough to reach a point of warmth and acceptable enjoyment.Here we have the story of Adam, a young man who has been suffering from back pain that winds up being a rare form of cancer.  This is, obviously, a hard blow to Adam, but it also trickles down to his friends, family and lover.  His girlfriend Rachel, a tad self-concerned and cold, undertakes taking care of him, which is harder for her than she imagined.  His best friend Kyle uses humor and the kindness of others to enrich his sick friend's love life (because girls each that cancer stuff up, apparently), as well as his own.  His mother is already slightly neurotic, and hearing of her son's illness she goes a little overboard, so Adam choses to avoid her at all cost.  `50/50' is very much a story of one man coming to terms with fate and in the process placing those he loves in proper perspective.To avoid the ignorance of a few reviewers here, I'll point out that everyone deals with situations in different ways.  To say that the mother and or the friend are clich&eacute;d examples of unrealities is presumptuous and arrogant.  In fact, I found the characterization of most of the main characters to be spot on.  Adam's calmly coated frustrations are appropriately uncomfortable, and his sideways glances and internalized fears are brilliantly conveyed (Joseph Gordon-Levitt is truly one of the best of his generation).  The character of Kyle is honest, using a defense mechanism in order to combat the fear of losing his best friend, and most likely his favorite person.  Diane, the grieving mother, reminds me so much of my own mother that I was brought to tears (that scene where she tells her son about the support group was beautifully acted).The film's only real misstep is in the character of Katherine.  Her characterization was in bad taste and it really took away from the whole film.  The way she was as a therapist was bad enough (her inexperience and unprofessional nature was unbelievable and irritating) but the obvious love interest spin on her character was just preposterous and ridiculous.  It took away from the honest direction the film was taking.THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A ROMANTIC COMEDY.That said, Gordon-Levitt, Rogen and Huston are astonishingly good here, and who knew that Ron Howard could produce a landmark in modern beauty like Bryce Dallas Howard (WHAT A FOX).`50/50' isn't perfect, but it is very good.",4,There's more than a 50/50 chance that you'll really like this...,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,2976,"['Having', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'Having', 'been', 'penned', 'Will', 'Reiser', 'who', 'happened', 'beat', 'cancer', '50/50', 'laced', 'touch', 'humanity', 'honesty', 'really', 'apart', 'usual', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'fare', 'earnest', 'intentions', 'are', 'pure', 'obvious', 'faults', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'generally', 'terribly', 'written', 'character', 'seem', 'be', 'easily', 'forgiven.So', 'yeah', '50/50', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'hard', 'enough', 'reach', 'point', 'warmth', 'acceptable', 'enjoyment.Here', 'have', 'story', 'Adam', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'back', 'pain', 'up', 'being', 'rare', 'form', 'cancer', 'obviously', 'hard', 'blow', 'Adam', 'also', 'down', 'friends', 'family', 'lover', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'tad', 'self-concerned', 'cold', 'undertakes', 'taking', 'care', 'harder', 'imagined', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'humor', 'kindness', 'others', 'enrich', 'sick', 'friend', 'love', 'life', 'girls', 'cancer', 'up', 'apparently', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'mother', 'already', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'hearing', 'son', 'illness', 'little', 'overboard', 'so', 'Adam', 'choses', 'avoid', 'cost', '50/50', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'fate', 'process', 'placing', 'proper', 'perspective.To', 'ignorance', 'few', 'reviewers', 'here', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'everyone', 'deals', 'situations', 'different', 'ways', 'say', 'mother', 'friend', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'examples', 'unrealities', 'presumptuous', 'arrogant', 'fact', 'found', 'characterization', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'be', 'spot', 'Adam', 'calmly', 'coated', 'frustrations', 'are', 'appropriately', 'uncomfortable', 'sideways', 'glances', 'internalized', 'fears', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'conveyed', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'generation', 'character', 'Kyle', 'honest', 'using', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'order', 'combat', 'fear', 'losing', 'best', 'friend', 'most', 'likely', 'favorite', 'person', 'Diane', 'grieving', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'brought', 'tears', 'scene', 'where', 'son', 'support', 'group', 'was', 'beautifully', 'acted', '.The', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'misstep', 'character', 'Katherine', 'characterization', 'was', 'bad', 'taste', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'whole', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'therapist', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'inexperience', 'unprofessional', 'nature', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'irritating', 'obvious', 'love', 'interest', 'spin', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'preposterous', 'ridiculous', 'took', 'away', 'honest', 'direction', 'film', 'was', 'taking.THIS', ""N'T"", 'SUPPOSED', 'TO', 'BE', 'A', 'ROMANTIC', 'COMEDY.That', 'said', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Rogen', 'Huston', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'here', 'who', 'knew', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'could', 'produce', 'landmark', 'modern', 'beauty', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'WHAT', 'A', 'FOX', '50/50', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'very', 'good']",N/A

1424528,AB33UE558VFWL,B004QL7KKC,"asshat ""asshat""","[0, 0]","I had rented ""50/50"" from Redbox. I had heard fairly good reviews about it and was in a bit of an emotional state of mind when I rented it. On a personal level, there were elements of the film that I could relate to. It reminded me very much of my relationship with my best friend.I'm usually the ""over-sentimental cheese head"" and my best bud is a little bit of the opposite. The two of us had a similar experience back in October 2010. I had just underwent triple bypass heart surgery and during the recovery process I had almost lost my life. I remember very little of what had happened within a 9 day time-span. I think there is about 20 minutes of time that will be engrained into my memory for the lost two weeks; but honestly, that's really it.I was in and out of consciousness and every single day, my best friend was there. Even with me having no knowledge of anything or anyone being there.The film struck such a chord that after I had finished watching it, I immediately found myself on amazon ordering my buddy a copy. Mind you, I think I had about maybe $50.00 left in my checking account until my next disability payment which was a week and a half a way.Three months after my surgery, with no choice at all, I had to leave my hometown and move over 500 miles away. Because of an intensively nasty relationship with my stepmother (my Mother had ironically passed away 4 years to the day I found out I required emergency heart surgery) and her son (who live in my father's house), I was unable to come home. At the time I was living with a roommate who was severely disturbed and my best friend was unemployed and stuck living at home with his parents. With no resources left I had to move out of state and with some friends from college in the middle of literally nowhere. If it were not for my friends taking me in, I would have been very ill and very homeless.That being all said, the film really, really hit a nerve. Despite a few ""hard to believe"" moments designed to move the film forward; it truly was something about the relationship and bond two people find within each other. There is a scene where Seth Rogan's character comes storming into his dying friend's home to confront his than girlfriend whom he (Rogan) discovers is cheating on him. The two friends care for each other very deeply and neither of them have have that ""homosexual"" stereotype that seems to be incorporated into alpha male relationships of such caliber. I respected that about the film. These were two straight best friends who loved each other like brothers. There was no need for cheap ""gay jokes"", that's something rare these days and I wish it would be shown more often in ""buddy pictures.""The film has some great laughs as well as the obvious touching moments. Even with the ending being a bit on the far-fetched side, ""50/50"" is the perfect movie for anyone who is lucky to have the type of friendship that these two characters do. It is heart warming, thought provoking, funny and above all a very well done film.Male or female, gay or straight, you'll need a heart of stone to avoid having a box of tissues handy throughout your viewing experience of ""50/50."" This is one of those movies you watch with your best friend to remind them how much they mean to you when you hit those moments in your relationship where its hard to express how you both feel about each other.I can't recommend this enough!",4,"It had a few dabbles of cheese here and there but overall, its a wonderful film.",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,3405,"['had', 'rented', '50/50', 'Redbox', 'had', 'heard', 'fairly', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'bit', 'emotional', 'state', 'mind', 'when', 'rented', 'personal', 'level', 'were', 'elements', 'film', 'could', 'relate', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend.I', ""'m"", 'usually', 'over-sentimental', 'cheese', 'head', 'best', 'bud', 'little', 'bit', 'opposite', 'two', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'back', 'October', '2010', 'had', 'just', 'underwent', 'triple', 'bypass', 'heart', 'surgery', 'recovery', 'process', 'had', 'almost', 'lost', 'life', 'remember', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'had', 'happened', '9', 'day', 'time-span', 'think', '20', 'minutes', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'engrained', 'memory', 'lost', 'two', 'weeks', 'honestly', 'really', 'it.I', 'was', 'consciousness', 'single', 'day', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'there', 'Even', 'having', 'knowledge', 'anything', 'anyone', 'being', 'there.The', 'film', 'struck', 'chord', 'had', 'finished', 'watching', 'immediately', 'found', 'amazon', 'ordering', 'buddy', 'copy', 'Mind', 'think', 'had', 'maybe', '50.00', 'left', 'checking', 'account', 'next', 'disability', 'payment', 'was', 'week', 'half', 'way.Three', 'months', 'surgery', 'choice', 'had', 'leave', 'hometown', 'move', '500', 'miles', 'away', 'intensively', 'nasty', 'relationship', 'stepmother', 'Mother', 'had', 'ironically', 'passed', 'away', '4', 'years', 'day', 'found', 'out', 'required', 'emergency', 'heart', 'surgery', 'son', 'who', 'live', 'father', 'house', 'was', 'unable', 'come', 'home', 'time', 'was', 'living', 'roommate', 'who', 'was', 'severely', 'disturbed', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'unemployed', 'stuck', 'living', 'home', 'parents', 'resources', 'left', 'had', 'move', 'state', 'friends', 'college', 'middle', 'literally', 'nowhere', 'were', 'not', 'friends', 'taking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'ill', 'very', 'homeless.That', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'hit', 'nerve', 'few', 'hard', 'believe', 'moments', 'designed', 'move', 'film', 'forward', 'truly', 'was', 'something', 'relationship', 'bond', 'two', 'people', 'find', 'other', 'scene', 'where', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'character', 'storming', 'dying', 'friend', 'home', 'confront', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'Rogan', 'discovers', 'cheating', 'two', 'friends', 'care', 'other', 'very', 'deeply', 'have', 'have', 'that', 'homosexual', 'stereotype', 'be', 'incorporated', 'alpha', 'male', 'relationships', 'such', 'caliber', 'respected', 'film', 'were', 'two', 'straight', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'loved', 'other', 'brothers', 'was', 'need', 'cheap', 'gay', 'jokes', 'something', 'rare', 'days', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'more', 'often', 'buddy', 'pictures', 'film', 'great', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'obvious', 'touching', 'moments', 'Even', 'ending', 'being', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'side', '50/50', 'perfect', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'lucky', 'have', 'type', 'friendship', 'two', 'characters', 'do', 'heart', 'warming', 'thought', 'provoking', 'funny', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film.Male', 'female', 'gay', 'straight', ""'ll"", 'need', 'heart', 'stone', 'avoid', 'having', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'viewing', 'experience', '50/50', 'one', 'movies', 'watch', 'best', 'friend', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'mean', 'when', 'hit', 'moments', 'relationship', 'where', 'hard', 'express', 'how', 'feel', 'other.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough']",N/A

A man (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) shockingly discovers that he has cancer during a visit to the doctor.  Of course he denies it and doesn't want to believe a single word of it, but after dealing with the rather rude and dismissive demeanor of the doctor, he finds out it's all too real.  His friend (played by Seth Rogen) tries to underplay his cancer and say that since the odds of survival are 50/50, Joseph has a good chance at beating it.Joseph has to break the tragic news to his girlfriend and waits for a dinner gathering to tell his mother.  He soon meets a rather attractive (and clumsy) therapist that helps keep his mind at ease.  Soon, Joseph's out there living it up so to speak, with Seth Rogen.  They party, hang out together, have relationship troubles, etc.  All while Joseph has to go through occasional cancer treatments.  I especially like the older men that Joseph sort of becomes friends with at the hospital.  They all share a bond involving different types of cancer.I feel the movie accomplishes putting a very serious cancerous condition in an optimistic light.  Even though Joseph very well could die, he's out there doing what most people his age do- meeting women and just being a young adult with dreams and ambitions.  I believe Joseph has the right look for the role he's playing.  It wouldn't look right for example if Seth Rogen was the one with cancer and Joseph was encouraging Seth to focus on the positive.However, the reason I take one point away is because eventually the storyline changes into a series of relationship issues.  His girlfriend cheats, Joseph cheats on his girlfriend (with a couple different women) and the movie basically switches gears halfway through and becomes almost a full-fledged relationship trouble-type film.  I also feel that Seth Rogen is a bit too obnoxious at times, especially towards Joseph's girlfriend.  That relationship is really none of Seth's business and yet, he continues to stick his nose in it time and time again.Still, the fact Joseph has cancer remains the focal point and the bottom line is that the movie accomplishes what it set out to do- that being, fighting cancer but not letting it stand in the way of a young man simply living his life.",4,"if this is the last ride, it's been a good one",1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,2320,"['What', '50/50', 'sets', 'out', 'do', 'accomplishes', 'make', 'best', 'dreaded', 'situation', 'man', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'shockingly', 'cancer', 'visit', 'doctor', 'course', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'single', 'word', 'dealing', 'rather', 'rude', 'dismissive', 'demeanor', 'doctor', 'too', 'real', 'friend', 'played', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'underplay', 'cancer', 'say', 'odds', 'survival', 'are', '50/50', 'Joseph', 'good', 'chance', 'beating', 'it.Joseph', 'break', 'tragic', 'news', 'girlfriend', 'waits', 'dinner', 'gathering', 'tell', 'mother', 'soon', 'rather', 'attractive', 'clumsy', 'therapist', 'keep', 'mind', 'ease', 'Soon', 'Joseph', 'there', 'living', 'up', 'so', 'speak', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'party', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'have', 'relationship', 'troubles', 'etc', 'Joseph', 'go', 'occasional', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'especially', 'older', 'men', 'Joseph', 'sort', 'becomes', 'friends', 'hospital', 'share', 'bond', 'involving', 'different', 'types', 'cancer.I', 'feel', 'movie', 'putting', 'very', 'serious', 'cancerous', 'condition', 'optimistic', 'light', 'Even', 'Joseph', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'die', 'out', 'there', 'doing', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'age', 'do-', 'meeting', 'women', 'just', 'being', 'young', 'adult', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'believe', 'Joseph', 'right', 'look', 'role', 'playing', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'example', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'was', 'one', 'cancer', 'Joseph', 'was', 'encouraging', 'Seth', 'focus', 'positive.However', 'reason', 'take', 'one', 'point', 'away', 'eventually', 'storyline', 'series', 'relationship', 'issues', 'girlfriend', 'cheats', 'Joseph', 'girlfriend', 'couple', 'different', 'women', 'movie', 'basically', 'gears', 'halfway', 'almost', 'full-fledged', 'relationship', 'trouble-type', 'film', 'also', 'feel', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'bit', 'too', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'especially', 'Joseph', 'girlfriend', 'relationship', 'really', 'none', 'Seth', 'business', 'yet', 'stick', 'nose', 'time', 'time', 'again.Still', 'fact', 'Joseph', 'cancer', 'focal', 'point', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do-', 'being', 'fighting', 'cancer', 'not', 'letting', 'stand', 'way', 'young', 'man', 'simply', 'living', 'life']",N/A

1424533,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004QL7KKC,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 3]","MOVIE RATING:  4.5 stars (A-)On the surface, a movie about a late-twenty-something guy being diagnosed with and treated for a rare malignant tumor on his spinal cord is not the makings of a great comedy. Yet, 50/50 (2011) completely surprised me, much like The Kids Are All Right (2010) did, and had me laughing throughout its 100-minute length. I've watched 50/50 three full times, once in the theater and twice on blu-ray, and I can honestly say that I just flat out love this movie. Each and every time, I laugh, I cry, and I have an outstanding time. As good or better than the last time. And I think that's mainly due to the very rich characters written by Will Reiser and brought to life by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Matt Frewer, and Philip Baker Hall. That's a hell of a deep cast! But they all bring such interesting and great nuances to each of their characters in this story, regardless of their amount of screen time.50/50 is a simply story, following Adam (played by Gordon-Levitt) as he is diagnosed and treated for cancer over the course of 6-12 months. Along the way, he goes through psycho therapy and multiple roller coaster relationship rides with his friends and family. Riding shotgun is Adam's best friend Kyle, played by Seth Rogen in a surprisingly good turn. Young director Jonathan Levine really put together a fantastic cast & crew to bring this relatively low-budget ($8 Million) flick to the masses in a way that harkens back to the incredible work done on the TV show M*A*S*H (1972-1983). What I've always loved about M*A*S*H, even still to this day in reruns, is how it could warp between laugh-out loud comedy and dry-your-eyes-out drama. All in a brisk 25 minutes. And 50/50 has that same kind of classic great writing and acting that makes a story eminently re-watchable over and over, without growing tiresome. I just know that I'll be laughing and crying at 50/50 when I'm watching it 30 years from now, just like with M*A*S*H. I've probably literally seen every single episode of M*A*S*H a dozen times, and yet I enjoy them again and again. So it's with high praise that I put 50/50 in that same company.All the filmmaking pieces came together extremely well for 50/50. The cinematography by Director of Photography Terry Stacey and his camera team perfectly captures the Seattle vibe and the up-and-down emotions of Adam going through the diagnosis and treatment of his cancer in and out of the hospital. Stacey's use of lighting at each location and in each set is masterful, usually in subtle but beautiful ways. On the surface, 50/50 looks and feels like a reality TV documentary almost at times with the ""stark"" natural lighting, but the cinematic artistry in the compositions and camera movements always reminds the viewer that this is a well choreographed movie.The editing by Zene Baker keeps the movie flowing perfectly. It moves quickly when it needs to, but it isn't afraid to linger when it needs to as well. It's got a deft balance that I like in this kind of dramedy fare. The music is a great mix of original score by Michael Giacchino and popular music by Radiohead (""High and Dry""), Pearl Jam (""Yellow Ledbetter""), The Bee Gees and Roy Orbison. It all comes together and brings a powerful emotional depth to 50/50.Once again, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showed his incredible talent in a movie with the numbers 5 and 0 in the title. 50/50 was one of the best movies last year, easily making it into my Top 10 Movies of 2011. It's the kind of film that improves with each viewing as the characters comfortably become like members of your own family and friends. I feel like 50/50 brought together the perfect balance of comedy and drama, laughter and tears, and gave us all a story about cancer that hits home in all the right ways.

1424535,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,B004QL7KKC,Blythe Dresser,"[70, 76]","This might just be my new favorite film.I went to see this, primarily, because I've always loved the previous works of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt as well as Seth Rogen.  The premise, a young man is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and tries to cope with it through humor, was appealing too.  On a small sidenote: I'm from Vancouver and the majority of the movie was filmed there, so that was a pleasant surprise.Adam is 27 years old and is shocked when he is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer on his spinal cord.  He relies on his hilarious best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogen); his unreliable girlfriend, Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard); and his overbearing mother, Diane (Angelica Houston), while he struggles with chemotherapy, doctor's appointments and losing all his hair.  His interactions with each of these characters are ultimately hilarious, even when they aren't intended to be.  Along the way his doctor sends him to a therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick), who is wet behind the ears but wants to specialize in helping cancer patients cope with their diagnoses.Kyle is a very genuine character who wants to do everything he can to help Adam, although he stumbles along the way.  He also takes advantage of Adam's situation as a way to meet girls, much to Adam's chagrin.  He makes light of the situation whenever the chance arises, but shows himself to be a very sincere friend at every opportunity.  Seth Rogen, actually playing the role he embodied in the real life story this movie is based on, is perfect as the somewhat dimwitted, but loveable best friend.Rachel is the villain, if there is one.  She is a typical flighty young woman who is torn between feeling guilty about Adam's condition and feeling freaked out and trapped by it.  The audience can't help but dislike her from the get-go, which ultimately grows into loathing.  Bryce Dallas Howard does really well in this role.Diane is the kind of mom that almost everyone can relate to, whether as their own mother or one of a friend or loved one.  She throws herself off the emotional cliff as soon as Adam tells her about this cancer, doing her utmost to support him, even when he keeps her at arms' length.Katherine, the love interest, is a young woman who genuinely wants to connect with her patients, but who is, at the same time, insecure about her lack of professional experience.  She connects with Adam (despite his initial reluctance) and ends up struggling with going above and beyond the appropriate protocol as a therapist.Last, but never least, Adam: Adam is the everyman.  He is hopeful, idealistic and passionate about his job as a radio broadcaster.  He is committed to his girlfriend, whom he adores, despite her aloof behavior.  He has a tight relationship with his best friend.  He loves his mother, but avoids her at all costs because of her smothering behavior.  His sudden cancer diagnosis throws his life into a tailspin, but he spends the majority of the movie trying to remain calm and rational about it.  He makes friends with his fellow chemotherapy patients, he allows his best friend to use his cancer diagnosis as a way to garner the sympathy of pretty girls, he (reluctantly) follows his insensitive doctor's advice to talk to a therapist about his cancer.  As one thing after another seems to go wrong we see him unravel and I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance was downright inspirational.  He teeters back and forth between denial, anger, despair, pain, fear and humor.  Although this role might not be typical Oscar fare, I think a nomination was definitely earned.The story of 50/50 is based on the real life experience of the writer, Will Reiser.  He was diagnosed with spinal cancer at the age of 26 while he was working on Da Ali G show with Seth Rogen.  Rogen, much like the character of Kyle, supported Reiser and tried to help him cope through the use of humor.  Fortunately, Reiser beat cancer and is alive today to tell the story he went through.  Although this movie is a comedy it has an equal number of dramatic moments and is incredibly touching.  You'll be struggling not to cry at moments.  Making cancer funny is a tricky thing and could easily crash and burn in offending audiences, but Reiser pulls it off beautifully.  You won't feel guilty laughing at humorous moments and you'll still empathize with the characters and each of their individual challenges.I will definitely be picking this up on blu-ray as soon as it's released.

I will be surprised if he does not win an Oscar within the next seven years.I think he was great in Mysterious Skin, but he has matured as an actor.  I just watched this movie on Showtime. It takes you from one emotion to another. Rogan provides most of the comedy, while Levitt emotionally carries you through the movie. He acted as most would if in the same situation. One can easily envision ones feet in his shoes, all of  a sudden  the world is jolted and death seems as ever present as life. I can also image an older psychiatrist trying to deal with a new cancer patient , who does not have must patience for ""psyche"" tactics. Levitt played the ""anger/resentment/fear just beneath the skin"" patient perfectly.  While being carried through all the emotions, one is constantly entertained. This movie does not bore and is more than worth the price. Parts were predictable, like one of the older cancer patients dying and its effect on Levitt's character, but the superb acting made it fresh and sad. The romance was understandably done to perfect understanding. The scared girlfriend who doesn't want to leave, but has trouble staying. The young female psychiatrist who has to be professional , yet is attracted to Levitt's character, while trying to help him deal with his illness. I will be watching this movie again and again on my premium channel, until I buy it which will be soon.I only gave this one four stars because I gave Mysterious Skin five stars. I believe MS was better, but one will not be disappointed with either. If you want to cry, tear up, laugh, cheer, applaud and sympathize, all while being entertained, , then give 50/50 one shot.

1424537,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B004QL7KKC,Brett Corkins,"[0, 1]","50/50 is about cancer. We all know that. I also think, in a roundabout way, that we know exactly what is bound to happen too, yet the director and actors do such a fantastic job throughout the entire movie that even when something happens that we expect, it still jolts us. That jolt is thanks in huge part to Joseph-Gorden Levit's masterful portrayal of a cancer patient.At its heart, 50/50 is a humerous movie tackling a very UNhumerous topic. For years I think people have been waiting for a film to take a very human approach to just how serious cancer is. This is that film. This film is so beautiful, so emotional, that you become lost in the character's struggles in coping with the fact that he may very well die. From the initial time of him finding out he has it to him accepting that he could die, his emotions and reactions are extremely human, and extremely believable.My grandma and grandpa both passed away from cancer, so this movie is sure to move me more than someone who hasn't dealt with it, but I can honestly say, his descent from a healthy 27 year old to a frail, shell of his former self happens just as fast as the movie says. All the steps he took emotionally (from anger and disbelief all the way to acceptance and even giving up) are real. It's heartbreaking, plain and simple.Joseph-Gordon Levit's performance is superb, I stated that already, but the supporting cast is phenominal as well. In particular, Seth Rogen and Anjelica Houston. Seth Rogen plays Joseph's sex obsessed friend, someone who doesn't seem all that concerned about the fact that his best friend is dying aside from his initial discovery. Anjelica Houston plays the mother.

1424539,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B004QL7KKC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[38, 41]","I can tell that this was inspired by the true story of screenwriter Will Reiser.  He has got every detail down so perfectly that it would either be that or that the man was sharing an esp channel with cancer patients.  His protagonist is diagnosed with spinal cancer. This is 27 year old Adam, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He discovers his is a rare form of spinal cancer with 50-50 odds of surviving it.  It has not yet metastasized so they will try to shrink it with chemo first and then operate.Seth Rogen plays his crude, loud, yet amazingly supportive best friend. Touchingly he even sneak reads on the side a book about going through cancer with someone. He provides the perfect foil for Adam.Adam makes and loses relationships along the treatment way, which is also very normal.  Some people are just better at coping with grave illness than others' are and if one has never had to move beyond a certain level of commitment to people, it can be neigh unto impossible to cope with it.One of the best turns of the whole film is the role of his smothering but loving mother.  I kept saying to myself, why does the actress playing the Jewish mother so brilliantly look so familiar?  I then almost fell off the sofa as I realized that it was Angelica Huston (who was raised by her loud, boisterous Irish father so is not a Jewish mother at all in real life).  Huston, however, not too long ago lost her long time spouse under similar catastrophic illness circumstances so I can see why she was a natural for the role.Adam even manages to connect with one of his medical workers played by Anna Kendrick. She brings a lot of humor to the role as he is but her third patient.  She is interning as a therapist on the way to her PhD in psychology.  What she lacks in polish, she makes up with sincerity and compassion.I am a cancer patient and this film is totally authentic.  It is not depressing.  This is a trial in this character's life and you see him go through this trial.  You live your life while you have cancer.  It is another life event which sometimes ends in your death. You don't suddenly become another person with cancer.  You are the same person facing a terribly difficult ordeal, which may be terminal. But then again, there is always one life event which always ends up bringing one's death.

Not being a big fan of roles played by Seth Rogen, I was apprehensive about the comedy.  Overall, the drama exceeds the comedy about 4 to 1 (even more so in the second half). Gorden-Levitt plays the extremely likable and sweet Adam Lerner.  Early on in the movie, Adam learns he has a serious form of cancer.  I can safely say I've watched ample movies about death, but none I think so specific to cancer.  The cast of characters includes his selfish girlfriend, emotional and somewhat self-centered but loving Mother, his Father who has advanced Alzheimer's, and his best buddy Kyle (played by Rogen).  Add to the mix his youthful 24-year old doctor / therapist, and it's anything goes.  The cast and the production somehow pulls together this entourage into a warm, at times funny and often serious storyline.  Adam's character lends to the dramatic aspect, and his character is quiet and introspective. I'm sure most viewers would willingly serve as his best friend, or girlfriend!As the film advances to the finish line, even I was moved by Adam's best friend Kyle's ability to be there when he truly needed him at his side.  The ending is quite moving, and by far the most dramatic (and sad) parts of the film. While all of us who are quick to tears will most certainly be in tears, the ending itself is positive, so you shouldn't be left crying through the credits too.  I think the film is about as delicate a balance you could have between comedy and drama in trying to tell a story of someone with such advanced cancer.",4,"Heartfelt Film About Cancer, and Family and Love and True Friends",1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1658,"['fan', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Mysterious', 'SkinandLatter', 'Days', 'seeking', 'light-hearted', 'film', 'decided', 'give', '50/50', 'watch', 'Not', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'roles', 'played', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'comedy', 'Overall', 'drama', 'comedy', '4', '1', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'second', 'half', 'Gorden-Levitt', 'extremely', 'likable', 'sweet', 'Adam', 'Lerner', 'Early', 'movie', 'Adam', 'serious', 'form', 'cancer', 'can', 'safely', 'say', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'ample', 'movies', 'death', 'none', 'think', 'so', 'specific', 'cancer', 'cast', 'characters', 'selfish', 'girlfriend', 'emotional', 'somewhat', 'self-centered', 'loving', 'Mother', 'Father', 'who', 'advanced', 'Alzheimer', 'best', 'buddy', 'Kyle', 'played', 'Rogen', 'Add', 'mix', 'youthful', '24-year', 'old', 'doctor', '/', 'therapist', 'anything', 'cast', 'production', 'somehow', 'together', 'entourage', 'warm', 'times', 'funny', 'often', 'serious', 'storyline', 'Adam', 'character', 'dramatic', 'aspect', 'character', 'quiet', 'introspective', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'willingly', 'serve', 'best', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'advances', 'finish', 'line', 'even', 'was', 'moved', 'Adam', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'ability', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'truly', 'needed', 'side', 'ending', 'quite', 'moving', 'far', 'most', 'dramatic', 'sad', 'parts', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'quick', 'tears', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'tears', 'ending', 'positive', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'crying', 'credits', 'too', 'think', 'film', 'as', 'delicate', 'balance', 'could', 'have', 'comedy', 'drama', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'someone', 'such', 'advanced', 'cancer']",N/A

For those of you who can't break words down properly, that's a ""drama"" mixed with a ""comedy.""  Basically, it's what people used to call ""good comedy.""50/50 is among the better dramedies to come out recently.  Based on writer Will Reiser's real-life battle, the film centers around Adam (Gordon-Levitt), who's diagnosed with ""back cancer.""  Adam's laid-back friend Kyle (Rogen, who else?) decides to add some spark into his buddy's life.  Thrown into the mix is Adam's well-meaning but ill-suited girlfriend Rachael (Howard), and his amateur therapist Katherine (Kendrick).Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers one of the best performances of his admittedly-impressive career.  His portrayal of Adam goes from ambivalent, to concerned, to infuriated, to needy, to resolved through the course of the film, and not once is there a sour note.  He and Seth Rogen have remarkable chemistry (several scenes were improved), and Rogen himself manages his usual charm (and I'm not even a Rogen fan, per say).  Bryce Dallas Howard is underused but greatly appreciated; her character manages to be sympathetic even while being unlikeable.  The same, in a way, goes to Anna Kendrick's Katherine: she's hardly a good therapist, but her and Gordon-Levitt have great chemistry together (seriously, this whole cast goes together like one part hydrogen and two parts oxygen), and their scenes make for some of the sweeter, more complicated in the film.  Kudos go to Anjelica Houston as Adam's smothering (but loving) mother, and Philip Baker Hall as an elderly cancer patient; like most of his movies, this film could use a lot more scenes with Hall in them.Jonathan Levine's direction is solid; except for the first ten-fifteen minutes (which kind of slog by), he has a great concept of pacing.  Reiser's script is spot-on; there's a lot of room for improv, but the best film improvisation revolves around an expertly-written script.  The ultimate result is a film that is delightful, thought-provoking, hilarious, emotional, frustrating--everything a good comedy should be.  It's a tad predictable (hence the lack of a star), but ultimately 50/50 is a film well-worth your while.  If dramedies aren't your thing, check it out for Gordon-Levitt's performance; the Oscars may have snubbed him, but they do get it wrong every now and then, don't they?",4,"A heartful, emotional comedy anchored by an amazing lead performance.",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2409,"['50/50', 'prime', 'example', 'trend', 'gained', 'momentum', 'lately', 'dramedy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'break', 'words', 'down', 'properly', 'drama', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'Basically', 'what', 'people', 'used', 'call', 'good', 'comedy', '50/50', 'better', 'dramedies', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'Based', 'writer', 'Will', 'Reiser', 'real-life', 'battle', 'film', 'centers', 'Adam', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'back', 'cancer', 'Adam', 'laid-back', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'Rogen', 'who', 'else', 'add', 'spark', 'buddy', 'life', 'Thrown', 'mix', 'Adam', 'well-meaning', 'ill-suited', 'girlfriend', 'Rachael', 'Howard', 'amateur', 'therapist', 'Katherine', 'Kendrick', '.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'delivers', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'admittedly-impressive', 'career', 'portrayal', 'Adam', 'ambivalent', 'concerned', 'infuriated', 'needy', 'resolved', 'course', 'film', 'not', 'once', 'sour', 'note', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'have', 'remarkable', 'chemistry', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'improved', 'Rogen', 'usual', 'charm', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Rogen', 'fan', 'say', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'underused', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'character', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'being', 'unlikeable', 'same', 'way', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Katherine', 'hardly', 'good', 'therapist', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'seriously', 'whole', 'cast', 'together', 'one', 'part', 'hydrogen', 'two', 'parts', 'oxygen', 'scenes', 'make', 'sweeter', 'more', 'complicated', 'film', 'Kudos', 'go', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'Adam', 'smothering', 'loving', 'mother', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'elderly', 'cancer', 'patient', 'most', 'movies', 'film', 'could', 'use', 'lot', 'more', 'scenes', 'Hall', 'them.Jonathan', 'Levine', 'direction', 'solid', 'first', 'ten-fifteen', 'minutes', 'kind', 'slog', 'great', 'concept', 'pacing', 'Reiser', 'script', 'spot-on', 'lot', 'room', 'improv', 'best', 'film', 'improvisation', 'expertly-written', 'script', 'ultimate', 'result', 'film', 'delightful', 'thought-provoking', 'hilarious', 'emotional', 'frustrating', 'everything', 'good', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'tad', 'predictable', 'hence', 'lack', 'star', 'ultimately', '50/50', 'film', 'well-worth', 'while', 'dramedies', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'check', 'out', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'performance', 'Oscars', 'may', 'have', 'snubbed', 'do', 'get', 'wrong', 'now', 'then', 'do', ""n't""]",N/A

Anna Kendrick's openly nave therapist character says it to Adam Lerner, the cancer-stricken, 27-year-old protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - ""You can't change your situation. The only thing you can change is how you deal with the situation."" It's a predictable bromide but one that spoke to me at that very moment since I just got laid off from my job the day prior. Facing life's unexpected twists is what this 2011 dramedy is about, and director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser find a poignant, funny and off-kilter way of handling a standard Lifetime TV-movie subject without losing respect for the characters. The film tows a fine line dramatically, but perhaps because Reiser has first-hand knowledge of spinal cancer from his own personal experience, the story doesn't lose its footing.The film focuses on Adam, a Seattle-based NPR staffer whose comfortable life is turned upside down when he learns he has malignant tumors along his spine. With little empathy, the oncologist tells him he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Buoyed by his boisterous best friend Kyle, Adam tries to remain optimistic despite his overbearing mother Diane, who wants to move in with him right away despite acting as a caretaker for his father, an Alzheimer's victim. Remaining disturbingly distant is Adam's artist girlfriend Rachael who promises to stand by him and nurse him back to health. However, as he goes through his chemotherapy, her commitment to him unravels. The movie addresses the bitter irony of how those one would expect support Adam without condition are the ones who are the most likely to fail. At the same time, he grows closer to two fellow cancer patients, as well as Katherine, the awkward young therapist who utters the line that rings so true for Adam.The acting is effective without excess. As a last-minute replacement for James McAvoy (X-Men: First Class), Gordon-Levitt gives a nice, self-effacing performance as Adam that feels right for the passivity needed for the role. Playing a version of his real self since he is Reiser's best buddy and the one who encouraged him to write the script, Seth Rogen provides manic, shaggy-dog energy to Kyle as a direct counterpoint to Adam and then surprises by deepening his character as the story progresses. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael as a more subtle version of the malevolent character she played inThe Help, but she may be in danger of stereotyping herself in like-minded roles. Kendrick also plays a variation of a previous role as the ambitious careerist inUp in the Air, but she does a better job of transcending her character's youthful exuberance this time. Easily stealing her few scenes, Anjelica Huston brings back her much-missed ferocity to Diane.

He next asks the question we all would in that situation.  The doctor looks uncomfortable and refers him to a therapist (played by Anna Kendrick).  When he visits the referral, she barely looks old enough to drink.  ""Is this a Doogie Howser thing?"" he asks, to which she replies, ""Who?""  The session goes downhill from there, but they do, in Hollywood tradition, begin a flirtation which turns into something stronger.Although Adam has a hedonistic buddy, played by Seth Rogen, who encourages him to be less repressed, he still isn't comfortable doing many of the things young people take for granted: like drugs, drinking and driving.  But dealing with a terminal illness is a great way to get someone to overcome their fears and become more assertive.  It's also good for becoming less selfish and self-absorbed. His over-protective mom (Anjelica Huston), fellow patient Philip Baker Hall, and the aforementioned friend and therapist make up a fairly non-stereotypical support system.One caveat.  Adam does not have Movie Cancer, or what Roger Ebert called Ali McGraw Disease.  So the agony of chemotherapy isn't warmly bathed in mellow light; there's no wisecracking, tough love therapist or doctor who helps him come to an epiphany; and he doesn't rail at the unfairness of the universe on a deserted but pristine beach.  Instead it's presented (I'm assuming) the way it really is: painful, tedious and embarrassing.

Perhaps it is because the subject matter (cancer) is tough or because the PR for the film wasn't broad enough. But watch it for yourself and marvel at the script (written by Will Reiser based on his own story of having cancer), the direction by Jonathan Levine who understands how to balance the two faces of life - comedy and tragedy - as well as anyone, and the astonishing sensitive acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and one of the finest ensemble casts assembled. This is a film that examines the effect of a cancer diagnosis on a young man, his friends, his love life, and the people with whom he comes into contact because of his disease. And those people include us, the audience.Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old writer of radio programs, happy with living with his artist girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) and spending his idle hours with his wisecracking goofy friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), has some back pain while jogging, visits a cold impersonal doctor (Andrew Airlie) who flatly diagnoses Schwannoma/Neurofibrosarcoma and informs Adam he must undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor of his spine before he can undergo surgery - the combined treatments offer a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam blindly accepts the information, shares it with Kyle, Rachel, and ultimately his mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer father (Serge Houde) - each of whom has a different reaction to the news: Kyle worries the Adam's relationship with Rachel is bogus (Rachel is having an affair despite the fact that she claims she will `be there' for Adam), his mother overreacts a bit and joins a support group for families with cancer diagnosed, Rachel leaves, and Adam begins chemotherapy.At the hospital Adam joins two cancer victim men undergoing chemotherapy (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) and the three become close, sharing marijuana macaroons and keeping things light. Adam is assigned to a psychotherapy doctoral student Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is younger than Adam and the two begin a series of sessions that, though awkward, open windows onto reality and to their individual and shared emotional backgrounds. Adam's chemotherapy succeeds in causing hair loss, headaches and vomiting but doesn't shrink the tumor. Adam is lined up for surgery and each person in Adam's life shows Adam their true colors.Author Will Reiser has said `Adam is very much an extension of me. But I didn't intend for that, it just happened. I just had so much I wanted to say. There's a real limitation on what you can and can't say - like you can't make fun of this, because it's taboo.' The result of his sharing his own experience is deftly portrayed in this rare comedy drama, allowing the viewer to see all sides of Cancer and how that diagnosis alters the life view of the victim and their support group. Seth Rogen has slimmed down and proves in this portrayal that he is capable of superb acting and character creation. Anna Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Philip Baker Hall, Matt Frewer and Bryce Dallas Howard render exceptional supporting roles. But the extraordinarily subtle and sensitive acting on the part of Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant: this is an actor who proves his chops in this career making role.

I could relate to many of the experiences and emotions shared between the two lead characters - the love, the support, and the fear.  The other reason is that this is just a darn good movie.The writer of 50/50, Will Reiser, based the lead character of Adam (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) on his own real-life battle with cancer.  Seth Rogen, who stars as Adam's best friend, Kyle, is actually Reiser's real-left best friend.Gordon-Levitt gives a wonderful performance, portraying Adam's initial shock at his cancer diagnosis, his fear of death, the rage, and the occasional need to just go out and meet some girls for a little fun.  Seth Rogen's Kyle is a bit one-note: the misogynistic lug.  But his support of Adam is steadfast, and the scene that reveals the depth of his concern for Adam made me tear up.A compelling cast of supporting characters include Anjelica Huston as Adam's mother and Anna Kendrick as the young therapist who counsels Adam.

But this movie surprised me in a very pleasant way.  50/50 is a sweet, funny and, above all, realistic movie about dealing with cancer.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding as Adam, a young man who has just been diagnosed with a very rare type of spinal cancer.  As the title suggests, he has a 50/50 chance of survival.  He goes through all of the stages of emotions that you would expect, from disbelief to hope to anger to depression.  But Gordon-Levitt doesn't overplay any of them.  Rather, he does an amazing job subtly expressing himself in ways that are both realistic and very touching.  His physical transformation is equally as impressive, as you watch him wilt away little by little.Gordon-Levitt isn't the only strong cast member.  Seth Rogen is great as his best friend, who, as expected, is having trouble figuring out how best to help his friend.  It's a fairly familiar role for Rogen as a wisecracking oaf who has an unexpected sweet side, but he plays it well.  Anjelica Huston is also excellent as Adam's mother, who is not only dealing with Adam's cancer, but also her husband's Alzheimer's.The real star of the movie though is the realistic portrayal of a life with cancer.  From Adam's emotional roller coaster to his girlfriend's collapse under the weight of her responsibilities to him to the incredible comraderie formed between Adam and two fellow chemo patients.  Having had a family member go through something similar, I can tell you that it's incredible how incredibly true all of it is.  Cancer is one of those topics that Hollywood typically overdramatizes.  50/50 totally breaks that mold and makes cancer real.  The only part that wasn't very realistic is Adam's relationship with his therapist, which borders on the unethical.Overall, this is an amazing film.  Anyone who has known someone with cancer or who wants to better understand what cancer patients go through should watch this.

1424577,A10H47FMW8NHII,B004QL7KKC,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","A comedy about cancer? Truth IS stranger than fiction because this dramedy is a fictionalized account of what happened to writer Will Reiser (""Red State Diaries"") and his best friend Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up"") when Reiser was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago (he was 24 at the time). He immediately saw friends and acquaintances fall away because they were uncomfortable around a person who had been given a 50% chance of survival. His best friend Seth Rogen (here called Kyle) had a different reaction: He said if it was a casino, 50/50 would be GREAT odds! And he encouraged head shaving; he thought it might be a great way to pick up women.This was a big hit (standing ovation) at the Toronto Film Festival and now we see why. Here is the wonderful cast:* Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"") is utterly convincing as a writer blindsided by illness, who has to suffer the discomfort of chums, lose a girlfriend and witness his mother's pain (his father has Alzheimer's). His black humor is familiar to me: my son David was stricken by a malignancy which he did NOT survive, but he always kept his sense of humor, so this rings true to me.* Seth Rogen (""Pineapple Express"") brings his trademark raunchy mouth and attitude to this story, but when I remember his real role in the actual story, I am willing to overlook a LOT! This was a true test of friendship and he passed with flying colors. (You WILL get a lump in your throat.)* Anna Kendrick (""Up in the Air"") dithers so beautifully! She is a neophyte counselor whose job is to help cancer patients adjust to their situation. Our hero is polite, but not very compliant.....* Bryce Dallas Howard (""The Help"") is once again cast in an unsympathetic role. This time she is the erstwhile girlfriend who bails at the first hint of a fatal illness.* Anjelica Huston (""When in Rome"") is our hero's mother who has a LOT on her plate: a son with a poor chance of survival and a husband with Alzheimer's. By the way, I'd like to tip my hat to Anjelica; she looks ""real."" No pillow lips; no stringy, scrawny body; no tilted tweaked eyes. From ALL of us: Thank you, Anjelica!* Serge Houde (""The Kennedys"") never says a word. He conveys perfectly the gentle silence of an Alzheimer's patient.* Philip Baker Hall (""All Good Things"") has chemo on the same schedule as our hero. Hall and another chum always bring pot brownies (Medical Marijuana) to these sessions and our Three Musketeers share them with contented smiles.* Matt Frewer (""Eureka"") is the third Musketeer, happily chowing down on those brownies as they chat away those tedious hours of treatment.Our screening audience included a group of cancer survivors and people from oncology centers with a Q & A session after the screening.I was happy to see a rescue greyhound incorporated into the story. Castoffs from the dog tracks are a separate tragedy being played out every day and we come to love the gentle giant ""Skeletor.""

1424581,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004QL7KKC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","50/50 is written by Will Reiser who loosely based it on his own life after being diagnosed with cancer and having Seth Rogen to help him through it. Cancer is a scary thing and not an obvious target for comedic fodder, but coming from a place of truth makes it a much easier sell. The ""dramedy"" genre may seem inappropriate for such a serious topic and some may find it hard to accept, but, ultimately, the subject is handled with grace and tact and the genre suits it quite well. It certainly helps that everyone behind and in front of the camera seems to genuinely care about the project.The film, while shot in Canada, is set in Seattle where 20-something Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works at a radio station and kind of lives with his girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). After some ongoing pain, Adam visits a doctor and is diagnosed with a rare type of cancer on his spinal column. He is informed that he must undergo chemotherapy to reduce the tumor before anything can be done about it. With the support of his best friend Kyle (Rogen) and his own family, he begins trying to cope with his illness. In addition to chemo treatments, Adam begins seeing an inexperienced therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) and, to my surprise, the film avoids the typical pratfalls and avoids descending into a cheap Hollywood romance.Director Jonathan Levine and Reiser create a successful film by keeping a consistent narrative that stays true to the story and characters. The film tackles the subject of a cancer diagnosis like I imagine most people diagnosed with cancer would want to; seriously, but with a sense of humor. The film never allows the subject itself to become a joke and everything is handled with a remarkable sensitivity that is matched by the performances. Gordon-Levitt continues his winning streak of choosing interesting, challenging roles for himself. He's the heart of the film, the anchor, and he makes Adam's transition believable, humorous, and heartbreaking. It's a difficult role that takes him through several different stages of emotion, but Gordon-Levitt captures just the right tone for all of them. Rogen is in typical stoner mode; obnoxious and loud-mouthed, but inherently likable. While he doesn't broaden his range as an actor, he demonstrates an ability to create a compassionate supporting character and I think he may possess more range than he lets on. Kendrick's performance is not far removed from her role in Up in the Air but she's absolutely adorable and brings a youthful intelligence to her part that makes it memorable.50/50 benefits from strong characterization, establishing the personalities of its characters and refusing to betray them in favor of a more commercial vision. It's rare for a movie of this sort to develop both characters and their relationships so well. If any complaint can be made it can be directed at the film's optimism. It never makes light of the cancer subject and it does touch on some of the dark territory involved, but it is a very sweet film with no desire to push the envelope or give a startling portrayal of the disease. It finds a perfect balance of comedy and drama, creating a pure combination that makes it impossible to group it under only one category. For what it is and what it does, it's one of the best films of the year. It's not going to change the world or anyone's outlook on life, but to take something heartwrenching and almost make it heartwarming...That's quite the accomplishment.GRADE: A-",5,A Perfect Blend of Comedy and Drama That Benefits from Strong Characterization,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,3496,"['50/50', 'written', 'Will', 'Reiser', 'who', 'loosely', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'having', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'help', 'Cancer', 'scary', 'thing', 'not', 'obvious', 'target', 'comedic', 'fodder', 'coming', 'place', 'truth', 'much', 'easier', 'sell', 'dramedy', 'genre', 'may', 'seem', 'inappropriate', 'such', 'serious', 'topic', 'may', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'ultimately', 'subject', 'handled', 'grace', 'tact', 'genre', 'suits', 'quite', 'well', 'certainly', 'everyone', 'behind', 'front', 'camera', 'genuinely', 'care', 'project.The', 'film', 'shot', 'Canada', 'set', 'Seattle', 'where', '20-something', 'Adam', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'radio', 'station', 'kind', 'lives', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'ongoing', 'pain', 'Adam', 'doctor', 'diagnosed', 'rare', 'type', 'cancer', 'spinal', 'column', 'informed', 'must', 'undergo', 'chemotherapy', 'reduce', 'tumor', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'support', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'Rogen', 'own', 'family', 'trying', 'cope', 'illness', 'addition', 'chemo', 'treatments', 'Adam', 'seeing', 'inexperienced', 'therapist', 'named', 'Katherine', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'surprise', 'film', 'typical', 'pratfalls', 'avoids', 'descending', 'cheap', 'Hollywood', 'romance.Director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'Reiser', 'create', 'successful', 'film', 'keeping', 'consistent', 'narrative', 'true', 'story', 'characters', 'film', 'subject', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'imagine', 'most', 'people', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'would', 'want', 'seriously', 'sense', 'humor', 'film', 'never', 'subject', 'become', 'joke', 'everything', 'handled', 'remarkable', 'sensitivity', 'matched', 'performances', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'winning', 'streak', 'choosing', 'interesting', 'challenging', 'roles', 'heart', 'film', 'anchor', 'Adam', 'transition', 'believable', 'humorous', 'heartbreaking', 'difficult', 'role', 'several', 'different', 'stages', 'emotion', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'Rogen', 'typical', 'stoner', 'mode', 'obnoxious', 'loud-mouthed', 'inherently', 'likable', ""n't"", 'broaden', 'range', 'actor', 'ability', 'create', 'compassionate', 'supporting', 'character', 'think', 'may', 'possess', 'more', 'range', 'Kendrick', 'performance', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'role', 'Up', 'Air', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'youthful', 'intelligence', 'part', 'memorable.50/50', 'benefits', 'strong', 'characterization', 'establishing', 'personalities', 'characters', 'refusing', 'betray', 'favor', 'more', 'commercial', 'vision', 'rare', 'movie', 'sort', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationships', 'so', 'well', 'complaint', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'can', 'be', 'directed', 'film', 'optimism', 'never', 'light', 'cancer', 'subject', 'touch', 'dark', 'territory', 'involved', 'very', 'sweet', 'film', 'desire', 'push', 'envelope', 'give', 'startling', 'portrayal', 'disease', 'perfect', 'balance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'creating', 'pure', 'combination', 'impossible', 'group', 'only', 'one', 'category', 'what', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'world', 'anyone', 'outlook', 'life', 'take', 'something', 'heartwrenching', 'almost', 'make', 'heartwarming', 'quite', 'accomplishment.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Proceed with caution.50/50 has us following Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a 27 year old radio journalist who finds out he has cancer. Seth Rogen plays the best friend and co-worker Kyle who seems to be the last person you want with you during a situation like this. As the story progresses Rogen's character really surprises you on just how much he cares. Adam's mother Diane is overbearing and on top of that she has to take care of her husband who has Alzheimer's. What I felt the movie did really well is show that these things happen to the families who are already having a hard time in life. Not only does Adam have a father with Alzheimer's, but he has a girlfriend who seems to not care all that much about him.JGT's performance in this film is phenomenal. His character tries so hard to portray this image that he's confident that everything is going to be fine, but it's obvious to everyone around him that he's having a hard time coping with the situation. Anna Kendrick plays the therapist Katherine who tries her hardest to get him to open up about what he's feeling. Because holding something like this is very unhealthy.Making a film about cancer is very risky because unless you or someone you know has gone through it, you really don't know what it feels like. I felt the writers did an amazing job at writing the script to make it feel like you were there with Adam. I haven't watched a film this powerful since Juno. They both took these really serious topics and created this whole story that sucks you in, but they throw in comedic elements so it's not too overwhelming. At the same time these elements don't seem forced or overdone. The last 25-30 minutes has to be some of the most powerful cinema I've seen in years. The entire cast did an amazing job. It got to a point where it did feel a little overwhelming, and I did get teary eyed, but it was a beautiful thing to watch.Lastly the music in the film is beautiful. The music, both composed and licensed, fit perfectly with each scene and really helped to bring each scene to life. Another film that I wish had released a score.Overall Score: 10/0 - I don't give out perfect scores often, but this film definitely deserves it.

I'd definitely recommend it, although be forewarned it can be quite depressing at some points.I would have given this more than three stars but there are a few things that I felt really took away from the movie. First off, the DVD box left me with unfulfilled promises when it described how funny this film is. There were maybe a couple points where I laughed, but a majority of the comic material wasn't funny at all. It seems a difficult combination trying to use a health scare (cancer) with humor, and it didn't really work here, at least from my perspective.Seth Rogen was not the right person for the character of his friend. Seth can indeed be funny, but as usual relied far too much on profanity to try to make the audience laugh. While dealing with a topic such as cancer, it seems unnecessary and out of place to use several ""f"" bombs in random places. Much to my surprise and to his credit, he did a pretty good job at the emotional scenes for his character, although these were few and far between.I felt the film did a great job portraying the hardships one faces after being diagnosed with cancer. It dealt with the raw emotion of finding out unexpectedly, especially at such a young age (27). And the difficulty of seeing others with cancer passing away when chemotherapy isn't enough. For these reasons and many others, it is worth a watch, but could have made it to the next level with a few changes here and there.",3,"Emotional movie, but not without its flaws",1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,1534,"['saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'be', 'forewarned', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'depressing', 'points.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'felt', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'movie', 'First', 'DVD', 'box', 'left', 'unfulfilled', 'promises', 'when', 'described', 'how', 'funny', 'film', 'were', 'maybe', 'couple', 'points', 'where', 'laughed', 'majority', 'comic', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'difficult', 'combination', 'trying', 'use', 'health', 'scare', 'cancer', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'here', 'least', 'perspective.Seth', 'Rogen', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'person', 'character', 'friend', 'Seth', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'funny', 'usual', 'relied', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'profanity', 'try', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'dealing', 'topic', 'such', 'cancer', 'unnecessary', 'place', 'use', 'several', 'f', 'bombs', 'random', 'places', 'Much', 'surprise', 'credit', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'character', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'between.I', 'felt', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'hardships', 'one', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'raw', 'emotion', 'finding', 'out', 'unexpectedly', 'especially', 'young', 'age', '27', 'difficulty', 'seeing', 'others', 'cancer', 'passing', 'away', 'when', 'chemotherapy', ""n't"", 'enough', 'reasons', 'many', 'others', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'next', 'level', 'few', 'changes', 'here', 'there']",N/A
1424586,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004QL7KKC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[25, 30]","Striking the right balance and tone has got to be an incredibly difficult thing to do when you are centering a comedic picture around a serious topic such as cancer. I suppose that's why we see so few cancer comedies--it just isn't a particularly amusing topic. On TV, Showtime has a Laura Linney helmed program called ""The Big C"" which addresses cancer as its principle theme. That program, however, (despite being beloved by many, so send me your hate mail) has the deck stacked with wacky caricatures and unbelievable situations that make it almost unbearably over-the-top. Maybe that's why ""50/50"" was an incredible surprise! It's easy to see why its perfectly measured screenplay has won numerous year-end accolades because the story deftly juggles the hilarious with the heartfelt. This is comedy that comes from a very real place with exceedingly believable characters, and yet--it is also surprisingly hard-edged and never devolves into sentimental treacle. In a word, the film's tone is perfect. With its smart screenplay and a wondrous lead performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, ""50/50"" is easily one of my favorite films of 2011.Gordon-Levitt plays a relatively uptight professional whose life is upended when he is diagnosed with a particularly nasty strain of cancer in his back. Reeling from the news, he tries to carry on as normal as possible. But outside influences and those who care about him soon start breaking down some of the carefully erected barriers he's hid behind his whole life. Seth Rogan as his obnoxious best friend, Anjelica Huston as his somewhat estranged mother, Anna Kendrick as his hospital therapist, Bryce Dallas Howard as his girlfriend, and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer as his chemotherapy partners round out one of the most effective ensembles of the year. Of course, when you're facing death--you figure out how precious life is and who is always going to be by your side. From a plotting standpoint, ""50/50"" may follow a somewhat expected course--but it is distinguished in the details and the performances. As Rogan pushes Gordon-Levitt to leverage his disease for moments of debauchery, the scenes expertly mix the disturbing with the hilarious with the real.If you're looking for just another lightweight sex comedy, this might be a little heavy. But any emotional investment is earned and worth it. I laughed out loud frequently AND experienced many instances where I was genuinely moved. But the movie and its great screenplay (inspired by writer and Rogan's pal Will Reiser's real story) never turns into a maudlin weepy. It may be one of the least manipulative films to deal with a fatal disease that I've seen in years, and I mean that as a huge compliment. There are certain actors that I will follow on faith, and through the years Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become one of those people. He has managed his career with precision, bouncing between indie and mainstream fare as well as lead and supporting roles. I always appreciate a young actor who is willing to take chances, to pick roles and movies that they're passionate about or that might challenge them. Gordon-Levitt rose to the top of his generation with an eclectic bounty of great performances in oddball films (Brick, Mysterious Skin, The Lookout) and, in my opinion, recently served up Oscar caliber work in ""(500) Days of Summer"" and stole every scene he was in during ""Inception.""

I love that it tried to take on cancer, and really present the reality of that, while also attempting to find the humor in it, or at least in the ordeal surrounding it. That was quite a risk in today's movie environment, and I'm glad this movie got made. However, it just didn't make it to 5-star level for me, mostly because it just wasn't funny to me. There are a couple good, funny moments, but there's more tragedy than humor, and I found it quite heavy to watch overall. Perhaps I am being superficial, but I needed just a couple more feel-good moments to balance out the tragedy.I think marketing this as a comedy is a bit of a mistake personally (or at least it was marketed that way in the trailer I saw.) It is a human drama, and probes how a cancer diagnosis impacts not only the patient but everyone around him. In a way, it is really a bromance movie, because the relationship between Joseph Gordan-Levitt and Seth Rogan is the strongest relationship in the film.

With this being said, making comedies on real problems makes for good movies and good feelings generally. However, despite this, not many people could imagine a comedy about cancer, which is one of the most serious diseases worldwide. Yet, despite this, 50/50 manages to not only be one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen, but also one of the most emotional, honest, and entertaining films of last year, if not, the past few years. The fact that 50/50 was snubbed for a best picture Oscar really made my interest and respect on the event drop a lot. This is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy, and chances are about 95/5 that you will love it.50/50 is about a normal, early twenties guy named Adam (played by the incredibly talented Joseph Gordon Levitt) who is diagnosed with spinal cancer at the beginning of the movie. He finds out through the internet that his chances of surviving the treatment are 50/50, split right down the middle. Throughout the movie, with the help of his best friend Kyle played by Seth Rogen, his paranoid mom played by Anjelica Huston, and her inexperienced therapist Katherine played by Anna Kendrick, Adam tries to deal with the physical and emotional stresses and pain of cancer. Throughout the movie, however, there are plenty of jokes that are related to cancer sometimes and sometimes not that put the movie on a much more real and personal level. The humor is often crude and outrageous, but in no way offensive or making you feel uneasy. The movie really shines when it comes to perfectly blending the comedy and dramatic part of a ""dramedy"". The humor really is some of the best and will often times make you laugh out loud. On top of this though, 50/50 has themes that deal with emotional pain, worry, love, and honesty. It is one of the most personal movies I have seen because it is so easy to relate to all of the characters in the film and they all shine in their own way. There isn't a single annoying character in the movie (there's a character that the audience won't like, mind you, but this character isn't annoying). Add in a love story that is as far away from cliche as can be and really works, and 50/50 has one incredible story, with some of the best dialogue I have seen in a while that makes the script masterful.The performances really make the pros from the script and plot shine though. To start, Joseph Gordon Levitt is really fantastic as Adam, the main character of 50/50. Not only does he have some good humorous moments, but he plays the character of dealing with such a stressful situation incredibly well. He plays the character so well that he is as relatable as anyone I have seen in a movie, and his character is really realistic. He really shines in the movie, especially towards the end where the most tears flow. Not only is he fantastic though, but Seth Rogen is also great! Seth Rogen plays the crude friend down incredibly well, and being able to draw out the most laughs in the movie. However, unlike some of his previous movies, Seth Rogen isn't just just the comic clown of the film. Like Levitt's character, his character is also very real, and adds to some of the emotional moments of the film. Because as much as he is crude, he really cares about Adam a lot and it really shows that he is a good friend close to the end of the movie. His performance was incredibly powerful. Everyone else was fantastic in the film as well. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend, who turns out to be a real bitch in the end, but her character was on a real scale as well, and her side story and performance added to the stress that Adam is dealing with. Also, Anjelica Huston did an amazing job as Adam's mother, once again being a very real character. She sometimes annoys Adam throughout the story just because she is a caring mom, but later in the movie Adam realizes some of the mistakes that he made and there are some really nice scenes towards the end of the movie between them. In addition, Anna Kendrick is fantastic as the inexperienced therapist, Katherine. You really can tell that she cares about Adam a lot and is trying to help him through his situation, and some of the scenes between them are hilarious and emotional. With all of these wonderful performances adding to an already amazing script, 50/50 shines bright.There is so much more to 50/50 that is great though that can't really be put into words. The pure joy in watching the movie simply isn't matched by many movies out there. It is one of the great achievements of last year, and it simply a must see for everyone. Never in a movie have I laughed and cried so hard, and 50/50's tone that is honest, yet not so gloomy makes it such an incredible movie that anyone can enjoy. So overall, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you should definitely buy it.

In fact, the humor is hysterical--I was laughing that much! Seth Rogan gets lots of very funny lines; he's the perfect counterpart to Adam's often serious outlook. The humor certainly made the topic of cancer much more manageable for me; and I could identify with Adam as a cancer survivor myself. The actors give convincing performances. The cinematography is excellent; the sets and dialogue are great; and the character development is well done--life doesn't stop, not even for cancer.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leads a life so cautious that he actually waits at street corners to cross even when no cars are in sight! Adam never even got a driver's license because he's too afraid of a car accident; his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) drives him to their office where they work on pieces for a radio station. Although Adam and Kyle are buddies, Kyle is different from Adam--Kyle prioritizes time with women and he takes some chances in life.  Moreover, Adam avoids his smothering mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) because she's too emotional for him; his girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) seems more stable.Adam's world is turned completely upside down when an oncologist tells him that his persistent back pain is caused by a malignant tumor on his spine. Adam starts chemotherapy so they can shrink the tumor and operate to remove it. Rachel is overwhelmed by Adam's diagnosis as she tries to hang in there; but Adam's mother breaks down when she hears her son is not well. On a brighter note, Adam befriends two chemotherapy patients in the hospital chemo suite, Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall). Look for a very funny scene immediately after Adam's first chemo session! Adam also talks to a Ph.D. student counselor, Katherine (Anna Kendrick), who doesn't know what she's doing; this provides even more comic relief.Yet Rachel thinks of straying; what happens there? Kyle wants to emotionally support Adam but Kyle is chasing women as always and he even uses Adam to get women. Then Dr. Ross tells Adam that the tumor is not responding to the chemotherapy and they will have to do a life-threatening operation; it's Adam's only chance of survival.There's still much more. We see the relationships between Adam and his chemo buddies Mitch and Alan; and look for extremely humorous scenes and situations all the way through that make the topic of cancer much easier to handle. We also see how the people in Adam's life react to his being so ill--will they ultimately rise to the occasion or not?The DVD comes with extras; I really liked the deleted scenes and ""The Story of 50/50.""""50/50"" depicts life with cancer yet it kept me laughing and glued to the screen.

1424601,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004QL7KKC,M. Bullions,"[0, 1]","False advertising: it's the reason why so many people are disappointed with so many movies. A film's trailers and television spots are what convinces so many of us to go to the movies, and if a film's advertising is misleading, it is usually anything but a good thing. I've never seen a falsely advertised movie have better end results than ""50/50"". The film was marketed as a laugh-out-loud comedy in the vein of ""The Hangover"" and ""Superbad"". It's nothing like either of those movies, and oh, was I happy about that.First of all, I find very few gross-out comedies to be soulful and important. For the most part, they are just throwaway fluff that are impossible to be remembered. ""50/50"" is definitely more of a drama than a comedy, which can be assumed from its premise alone.It follows Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man who re-examines his life after a terminal cancer diagnosis. His diagnosis is some rare kind of spinal cancer, and his chance of survival is at about 50/50. He intends to learn what matters in life, and to live every minute to its fullest, knowing that any one of those minutes could be his last. His profane and ignorant best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and his young therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) supply him with optimism and humor when he needs it the most.There has been a television show running for the past few years, with a similar concept called ""The Big C"", and this is pretty much that same kind of story. I love ""The Big C"", I think that it handles its difficult and horribly sad concept wonderfully, never making anything too dour or bleak, thanks to a much-needed sense of humor, however, despite being a fantastic series, not many people have seen ""The Big C"". What ""50/50"" is doing is basically telling the same story to a wider audience, and that's okay because of how strong it is on its own.Being decidedly more a drama than a comedy, it has the pathos and dramatic flare that I expected, but it has a way of surprising the audience. It had me crying actual tears, and then laughing audibly a moment later. It's more dramatic than funny, although it is also very very funny. The most refreshing part was that it didn't try too hard to be a laugh-out-loud comedy. It appears effortless, but it definitely works.Also, the supporting cast is dead-on. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist, Katherine, a grad student working on her doctorate, whose third patient (ever) is Adam. Anjelica Huston plays Adam's overbearing mother, whose husband is dying of Alzheimer's. Huston gives a fiercely funny, yet understated performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is sure on a role. She seems to have a knack for playing terrible people. Between this and her role in ""The Help"" earlier this year, I wouldn't be surprised if her next role featured her kicking a puppy.I think I'm a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan. I loved his work in ""500 Days of Summer"", and he plays the easy-to-root-for everyman very well. I think Seth Rogen is funny, but he can easily be overkill. He plays the same role in every movie in which he stars, I find. However, he's clearly there for comic relief in this film, and he does his job fairly well.I also have to applaud the script by Will Reiser, which is apparently semi-autobiographical. I think the right actors were clearly chosen, and everything fell into place from there, but this kind of film could be a disaster without the right screenplay. It shouldn't have been as good as it was, if I think about it. I don't know why I love ""The Big C"" as much as I do, but that and ""50/50"" share the same nuance and attitude about life and death, which I really appreciate. While not quite asking the ""big questions"" (reincarnation, meaning of life, etc), ""50/50"" seems very wise and very intelligent.

I guess many people are turned off by the idea of a comedy about cancer, or were warned away by critics' complaints about the film's raunchiness. (Actually, ""50/50"" is tamer than ""Superbad"" or ""Knocked Up""; I think the complaint arises from the film's one-time use of the only cuss word that still contains any shock value--and no, I'm not repeating it here!)Everyone knows by now that the film is based on the real-life experiences of screenwriter Will Reiser, and co-stars his real-life best friend, Seth Rogen, who also co-produced. The story concerns Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a clean-living, conscientious young man whose life falls apart when he is diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of spinal cancer. The humor in Reiser's screenplay arises naturally from the siutation and the characters, always strengthening rather than undercutting the poignancy of the situation; this is definitely the work of someone writing from experience. But what you will mostly remember from ""50/50"" is the exquisitely understated performance of Gordon-Levitt. The entire performance is in his eyes; when he receives particularly bad news from his doctor, his face shrinks into something resembling a pathetic, mistreated animal. Gordon-Levitt has only one big emotional outburst throughout the movie, which is too bad from an Oscar standpoint; Oscar values big emotional outbursts above all. By any reasonable standard, Gordon-Levitt gives a great performance.Rogen, meanwhile, goes a long way in ""50/50"" toward expiating the sins he committed in the atrocious ""Green Hornet."" His oaf-with-a-heart-of-gold act probably has a limited shelf-life, but it works beautifully here. All the performances are excellent, including Anna Kendrick as Adam's inexperienced therapist; Bryce Dallas Howard as Adam's less-than-reliable girlfriend; Anjelica Huston as Adam's smothering but loving mom; and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer as Adam's fellow cancer patients.

Oleson,"[1, 2]","The title of the film references the reported odds of surviving a rare sort of cancer that has attached itself to Adam's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) spine.  Adam is a 20 something radio commentator whose best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) works with him.  Up to the time of the diagnosis, they did the usual guy things except the two guys aren't much alike.  Adam is a neatnik who doesn't smoke or drink.  He's currently living with a dull but hot artist (Bryce Dallas Howard).  Kyle is... well, Seth Rogen as you know and love him.  He's just what the doctor order in this sometime sad but still funny movie.  Director Jonathan Levine never takes us to the maudlin style usually found in these films.  Weep you may, but it's not due to the music or overly sentimental lines of BS.Of course, the film is about a young man in the prime of his life receiving a potential death sentence but it is also a true story involving screenwriter Will Reiser and his friend Rogan.  There are two additional plot points that shore up the film.  Adam begins to see a social worker in an effort to deal with the psychological aspects of the disease.  She is played by the wonderful Anna Kendrick, who in spite of being a regular in the ""Twilight"" franchise, proved her acting depth in ""Up in the Air"" was no fluke.  The patter between Adam and Katie is well written and brilliantly delivered.The other development to watch is the change in the relationship between Adam and his mother Diane played by Anjelica Huston.  The scenes between them are unusually heartfelt and fleshed out enough to give Huston a chance to stretch out her acting skills.

Some of the humor was a little too vulgar and cliche, but I decided to continue watching because I was curious to see how it ends. Well, I'm glad I stuck around. The movie brought a tear or two to my eyes and made me smile quite a bit. This is a movie about cancer, but the humor is appropriately placed with scenes of darker material. Joesph Gordon-Levitt really captured the emotions of his character, Adam. While Seth Rogen, who I can honestly say I have never been a fan of, left me surprised by the end of the movie. He provided enough humor to make the movie feel less of a downer. Lastly, Anna Kerick's character was a delight to watch.

1424622,A1FCBJNIFF4PPU,B004QL7KKC,prairie woman,"[1, 1]","Someone recommended this movie to me and I was glad that I watched it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a young man who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer.  He also happens to be an obsessive-compulsive kind of guy who can't stand clutter or messes, doesn't drive because of the odds of being killed in a traffic accident, and is just kind of a nerdy individual.  Seth Rogan of Knocked Up fame plays  Kyle, a crude, sloppy, laid back kind of guy who is Adam's best friend.  The girlfriend, Rachel, played by Bryce Dallas Howard,aka Hilly of The Help portrays the self absorbed, artist type who can't deal with the unpleasantness of Adam's diagnosis.  Anjelica Huston as Adam's mom, Diane plays the protective parent who also has to deal with a husband with dementia.  The actor who plays this role did an excellent job even though there wasn't much dialogue on his part. The whole premise of someone given a devastating diagnosis like Adam's was a good script as it shows him trying to take it in as the doctor tries to explain in very technical terms what is wrong. Then there is the therapist, a young doctoral student who is trying to help but is too caught up in trying to write a discertation.  Eventually this turns into a friendship as Adam makes her aware that he doesn't fit the textbook idea of what he really feels. Adam also has to deal with co-workers who try to be helpful as they describe  relatives that had cancer but of course can't seem to relate and make Adam feel more uncomfortable. There is a lot of humor in this movie as Kyle tries to encourage Adam to get out more, pick up chicks, and try to let go and have a good time.  That's hard to do when you are in pain, tired, and nauseous most of the time.  Adam is made aware of his mortality as he makes friends with his chemo buddies who are also facing challenging outcomes.

He ends up in the office of an oncologist, who tells him it is a rare form of cancer of the spine. From then on nothing is the same for Adam. The oncologist is the kind of physician you never want to meet when you have cancer, he should be in the minority.50/50"" was written by Will Reiser, who was diagnosed with a spinal tumor. Seth Rogen, who plays Adam's best friend, Kyle, is a close friend of Reiser in real life, and the movie is based on what happened in their friendship after the diagnosis. However, the line between fact and fiction is less distinguishable than Will Reiser thought. Will's therapist was in her fifties, Adam's therapist, Anna Kendrick, was his own age. Adam was his therapist's third patient on her way to getting her PhD. Adam had support throughout some of his therapy from a girlfriend, and then she couldn't cope and left. Seth Rogen's character took over as his support and caregiver. Adam' mother, played by Anjelica Houston was smothering as his real lie mother, and it drove him crazy and this was the subject of much of his therapy. However, much of the film is not true life, as Will Reiser tells us.The business of cancer is not discussed as much as it is shown. The chemotherapy and the after affects, the people you meet during chemo, the relationships you make, the people who die and the people who make it, that is the real stuff. Adam's chemo was not working, so surgery was discussed, and he had a long post surgery recovery. Will Reiser is now 6 years out from his cancer, and he is still in Physical Therapy working on rehabilitating his body.'Fresh Air' on NPR had a wonderful discussion and interview with Will Reiser and Joseph Gordon Levitt about the film. The interview with Terry Gross was so well done, I wanted to get out of my car and find the film and watch it instantly.The film lives up to the billing. I loved it!

In most parts, the humor-infused battle against cancer is closely resembled in the bookThe Fault in Our Stars, which I HIGHLY recommend reading. On the other hand, the sickness and familial issues are relatable toA Monster Calls: Inspired by an idea from Siobhan Dowd. If you see this movie, I would encourage you to read both books.After reading other reviews, I feel the compulsory need to clarify that this movie is a drama. Relationships crumble, people get sick and die (not a spoiler; some cancer patients do face death in this movie). The topic covered in this movie is serious and heart-rending. However, Seth Rogan's comedic addition is PERFECT. As someone who has been on death's doorstep, I can say with familiarity that humor is the grace that makes the situation bearable.My only fault with this movie is the Americanized ending, which tends to fall into the campy, feel-good side of things. Emotionally, this movie hits all the right notes, but sings a little high at the end as the song closes. Anna Kendrick did a phenomenal job in her role, but her relation to the protagonist, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reached just outside the scope of believability.All-in-all this has now become one of my favorite films and deserves to fill up all five slots of the star rating.

1424637,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B004QL7KKC,Sheryl Fechter,"[6, 7]","50/50 is titled for a specific reason, although in consideration of another, I'd say ""100/100"" for this movie.  I was a bit apprehensive about watching this as I am not a huge fan of Seth Rogen (Kyle) and usually shy away.  This one starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Adam) also, certainly gave it enough pull for me.  I am also glad that I did a little homework on this wonderful film first and found out its basis - grounded in a true story involving Rogen himself.The movie is set in Seattle with Adam and Kyle working for the local news station.  These two have been friends since their high school days and are still as close as brothers.  While Kyle is the ever fun seeking, hedonistic type, his friend Adam is more serious and settled with his girlfriend Rachael.  He's physically active so when he begins having pain in his back, affecting his running and right into his intimate life, he seeks out a doctor's diagnosis.  He receives the information back to him in a stoic, impersonal doctoral review. It is cancer located in his lower spine.  Adam doesn't understand as he's only 27 and is in great health.He explains the diagnosis to Rachael who promises him she will always be there for him, as he gives her an ""out option"" at this point.  He also tells his mother (Anjelica Huston)  and father (who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease) at a family dinner.  Adam has been reticent to let his mother know because of her, at times, overbearing nature, but first off he lets his buddy Kyle know. He is usually a very jocular guy although starts literally gagging, dry-heaving and saying he is going to ""throw-up"". He then starts telling how celebrities ""beat this all the time - just look at 'Patrick Swayze' or 'Lance Armstrong'"" (""who just keeps getting it back, he's that good at it"").  Kyle does nothing wrong with the humor, he keeps it in balance to the horrific experiences that his friend goes through and never leaves him nor stops supporting him.Kyle and Adam are quite dedicated to each other while Rachael cannot seem to hold-up her end of the bargain. She ends up getting caught cheating by Kyle, then leaves the scene.  She had me extremely angry and questioning.Adam's Therapist is an interesting addition to the story, Katherine McKay. She is now just shy of her doctorate and trying so hard to help by using 'touch therapy' with Adam.  He is uncomfortable with this touching and at one point replies to her hand on his arm, ""it's like being slapped by a sea otter"".  Katie takes things very personal for a therapist getting her own feelings hurt, she takes Him very personal and tries not to.As Adam begins going through his rounds of chemotherapy he meets, and is always with, two older gentlemen that add another element of humor to this.  This would be in the form of passed around 'marijuana-laced macaroons' baked by one of their wives.  It seems as if there is an amount of laughter in every situation, while the subject of cancer isn't funny.  It also is as if this movie does not need to apologize nor excuse the fact that there is humor in such a dire situation.  There is a definite ease to this, that would border on hysterical concerning some situations with Kyle and Adam.  Seth Rogen is unpolished, as usual, although totally perfect as a best friend to Gordon-Levitt's character.  Keeping his friend from sinking below the surface at all times, allowing for sadness to come out and then land with such a faithful upswing afterwards.These two remain loyal friends throughout it all.  Kyle using Adam's cancer to help him (Adam) find women to date, just being typical guys through everything Adam has to suffer.  Humor always abounds in this story, and it isn't necessary for restraining laughter from it.  That is a very bold statement.  That is why I did my homework on this film first; listened to other's positions on this including Seth Rogen in several interviews, and read everything that I could beforehand.  I had to weigh this heavily before viewing this myself, as cancer has touched my own life.  I had no idea how a movie that has a cancer theme could be hysterically funny: Well, it is and it intrigues me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is dynamic in his performance, he's subtle and bold.  He is full of dry humor and also able to convey the full out emotional side of it also.  He has really been showing lately just what he can do with his acting as he shifts into big Hollywood then Indie films.  Seth Rogen is 'pure swearing magic' (I can hardly believe I just wrote that) and made this movie possible, literally.  He also shows such a loyal persona that I haven't seen from him before.  If you didn't really appreciate him before seeing this movie,  I think you will after.The best part of this movie is that it allows the theme of cancer out for some driving room.  One could remain down in the quagmire of it all while watching, although this is equipped with a lift on board that hoists you right over the top with each new scene. It's fast-paced, funny, heartbreaking and hysterical.  What a ride and what a movie.  A comedy that is not making bold blanketed statements, it is only regarding one man's experience and it is quite remarkable at that.",5,One Of The Best  'Buddy Movies'  I've ever seen!,1327881600,"01

1424641,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B004QL7KKC,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","What would you do if you were diagnosed with cancer?Will Reiser's screenplay is based on his own experiences after he was diagnosed. That doesn't sound like a promising subject for a comedy, but 50/50 is definitely funny. It's also quite moving in places and the subject matter sometimes provides genuine drama.I know that some people will avoid seeing the movie because they either have cancer themselves or know someone with the disease. I understand that choice, but I lost my mother to cancer when I was 12 and I'm glad that I bought the movie. I have friends who deal with serious diseases by joking about it. You would never know that they were ill. Just because 50/50 is a comedy, it doesn't mean that it makes light of cancer.The main difference between 50/50 and a movie such as The Bucket List is that the main character is in his twenties. We all know that we will die one day, but it seems wrong to have a life-threatening illness at such a young age.Adam Lerner (Gordon-Levitt) works as a radio show writer. One day while running he experiences back pain. When he gets it checked out, it turns out that he has a large cancerous tumor in his spine. Rachael (Howard), his girlfriend, promises to give him all the support he needs. His best friend, Kyle (Rogen), insists that Adam will be fine. Adam's mother (Houston), who is already dealing with her husband's Alzheimer's, wants to move in with Adam help him through a difficult time.Adam can scarcely believe what has happened and spends most of his time with Kyle. They regularly get drunk and high and Kyle tries to use Adam's disease as a hook to attract women. He seems to worry more about getting laid than the health of his friend. Rachael does her best at first, but when the reality of Adam's situation takes hold, she isn't as supportive as she expected to be. When crunch time finally comes, it's Kyle who is there for Adam.We are shown some of the realities faced by people with cancer. Adam befriends other cancer patients at the hospital and they all have an optimistic outlook on life, despite the reality of their disease.Another major character is Katherine (Kendrick), who plays Adam's therapist. She's 24-years-old and younger than Adam and he's skeptical when she reveals that he is only the third patient she's ever had. I enjoyed Kendrick's performance in Up in the Air and was impressed again here. Her character is much warmer in this movie and Adam likes her as a person despite her flaws.The acting is good across the board. Gordon-Levitt is very good as Adam, without going over the top. Rogen's character is initially abrasive and somewhat annoying, but he proves to have hidden depths. The friendship felt authentic by the end of the movie. Anjelica Houston doesn't have a large role, but she makes use of every second.The title refers to Adam's chances of survival when he looks up his disease on the Internet. The chances that you will like the movie are significantly higher.The Blu-ray presentation is very good and comes with a commentary, deleted scenes, and a feature explaining the story behind the movie.",4,I look like Voldemort,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3104,"['What', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'Will', 'Reiser', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'was', 'diagnosed', ""n't"", 'sound', 'promising', 'subject', 'comedy', '50/50', 'definitely', 'funny', 'also', 'quite', 'moving', 'places', 'subject', 'matter', 'sometimes', 'genuine', 'drama.I', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'cancer', 'know', 'someone', 'disease', 'understand', 'choice', 'lost', 'mother', 'cancer', 'when', 'was', '12', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'movie', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'deal', 'serious', 'diseases', 'joking', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'were', 'ill.', 'Just', '50/50', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'light', 'cancer.The', 'main', 'difference', '50/50', 'movie', 'such', 'Bucket', 'List', 'main', 'character', 'twenties', 'know', 'will', 'die', 'one', 'day', 'wrong', 'have', 'life-threatening', 'illness', 'young', 'age.Adam', 'Lerner', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'radio', 'show', 'writer', 'One', 'day', 'running', 'back', 'pain', 'When', 'checked', 'out', 'out', 'large', 'cancerous', 'tumor', 'spine', 'Rachael', 'Howard', 'girlfriend', 'give', 'support', 'best', 'friend', 'Kyle', 'Rogen', 'Adam', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'Adam', 'mother', 'Houston', 'who', 'already', 'dealing', 'husband', 'Alzheimer', 'move', 'Adam', 'help', 'difficult', 'time.Adam', 'can', 'scarcely', 'believe', 'what', 'happened', 'most', 'time', 'Kyle', 'regularly', 'get', 'drunk', 'high', 'Kyle', 'tries', 'use', 'Adam', 'disease', 'hook', 'attract', 'women', 'worry', 'more', 'getting', 'laid', 'health', 'friend', 'Rachael', 'best', 'first', 'when', 'reality', 'Adam', 'situation', 'hold', ""n't"", 'as', 'supportive', 'expected', 'be', 'When', 'crunch', 'time', 'finally', 'Kyle', 'who', 'there', 'Adam.We', 'are', 'shown', 'realities', 'faced', 'people', 'cancer', 'Adam', 'other', 'cancer', 'patients', 'hospital', 'have', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'life', 'reality', 'disease.Another', 'major', 'character', 'Katherine', 'Kendrick', 'who', 'Adam', 'therapist', '24-years-old', 'younger', 'Adam', 'skeptical', 'when', 'only', 'third', 'patient', 'ever', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'Kendrick', 'performance', 'Up', 'Air', 'was', 'impressed', 'again', 'here', 'character', 'much', 'warmer', 'movie', 'Adam', 'person', 'flaws.The', 'acting', 'good', 'board', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'very', 'good', 'Adam', 'going', 'top', 'Rogen', 'character', 'initially', 'abrasive', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'have', 'hidden', 'depths', 'friendship', 'felt', 'authentic', 'end', 'movie', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'role', 'use', 'second.The', 'title', 'refers', 'Adam', 'chances', 'survival', 'when', 'up', 'disease', 'Internet', 'chances', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'significantly', 'higher.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'very', 'good', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'explaining', 'story', 'movie']",N/A

Seth Rogen is his uncouth best friend who is far more likeable. The non-conformist in me was glad Adam got cancer as opposed to Kyle. The humor is low impact. It wasn't LOL funny. For instance Katherine (Anna Kendrick) is Adam's stress counselor. She is 24 and just a delight, thank you Anna. Adam makes a remark about Doogie Howser. She doesn't know who he is and asks, ""Does he work here?"" We discover that the more syllables a cancer name has, the worse it is.His GF Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) becomes less supportive as Adam is not her only interest. Like ""Man in the Moon"" (for those who like funny movies about cancer) the film gets sadder as it progresses. As a cancer patient you get to make friends with other cancer patients, bond with them, and go to their funeral.Anjelica Huston did an excellent job as Adam's mother for the short time she was on the screen. The acting was good. The script was up and down. Joseph Gordon-Levitt starts out as the weakest person in the film. It wasn't until he told Rachael to get off his porch does his character pick up and we start to develop respect for him.

While the writer tries to use comedy to lighten the mood, I felt that all it did was distract me from the story and bring the quality of the picture down.

That ends up being something of a double-edged sword as the in-house psychologist, Katherine McKay (played by Anna Kendrick), is very inexperienced.This is the second film in just over two years to feature a comedic take on a serious illness and Seth Rogen in a significant role. The first being 2009's Funny People with Adam Sandler. Having seen both, I can say unequivocally that 50/50 is not just a better film, but a great film.  There are solid performances from all the cast, an interesting story and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't appear too good to be true.

1424653,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004QL7KKC,Turfseer,"[7, 49]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.550/50 is by Will Reiser, who by his own admission had writer's block until he was stricken with a rare form of spinal cancer. He thought it would be an original idea if he wrote a 'comedy' about a topic he was familiar with. As it turned out, 50/50 (which refers to the protagonist's chances of survival), plays more like a 'dramedy', than a narrative written strictly for laughs.At the outset, a story such as this is going to have difficulties, due to the apparent lack of a strong antagonist. Obviously, Reiser's stand-in for himself, Adam Lerner (played endearingly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) does have that internal arc, where we're curious as to see how he copes with his illness. The external story arc, whether Adam survives the cancer or not, seems to be a foregone conclusion, since not only are many people aware that Reiser survived the cancer (after all he was well enough to write the screenplay) but the whole idea of killing the protagonist off, might have been a little too much for most film goers to take.Unfortunately, the writing takes a decisive wrong turn when Reiser opts to make Adam's girlfriend, Rachael, the 'bad guy'. It's not like Rachael's been married to Adam for years and then decides to abandon him, by having an affair. No, it's quite understandable that a young woman would feel resentful about being placed in the role of a 'caregiver' instead of a 'girlfriend', at such a tender age. What is her great crime? She decides to have that affair and fails to tell Adam about it. And the reason why she fails to tell Adam she's cheating on him is because just as much as she wants out, she also feels extremely guilty about what she's doing and would really like to still help Adam, but can do nothing, as he begins wasting away from the side effects of chemotherapy.Along comes the obnoxious Seth Rogen, who plays Adam's vile buddy, Kyle. Rogen as Kyle, in his holier than thou attitude, throws Rachael under the bus, painting her as a despicable villain, merely because she's acting like most people would in her situation (note that squeaky clean therapist, Katherine, played by Anne Kendrick, only has to see Adam in her office and isn't privy to the extent of Adam's deterioration, as Rachael is). Note that Adam was very kind with Rachael at first, when he tells her that he would understand if she left him. But due to Kyle's unwholesome, negative influence, Kyle cajoles Adam into destroying Rachael's oil painting. What an ugly scene!I understand that it's sometimes important to try and use humor to try and soften an overwhelmingly depressing situation (as in the case of a diagnosis of cancer). But what is so humorous about a 'buddy' such as Kyle, always encouraging his stricken friend, to continue to attempt that one next sexual conquest followed by another. Is this his way of making Adam feel more 'normal'? I hardly believe that Adam needs that kind of encouragement. It will only lead to bad feelings amongst all parties involved!I was reading one cancer survivor's review of 50/50 and he felt the film minimized what it was like to cope with cancer. The poster writes in substance: ""Chemo is an incredibly powerful drug...the longer you're on it, the more cells it continues to destroy, and it basically slowly kills you. I saw the character sick after his first infusion, and then doing quite well throughout the rest of his illness...The opposite is true; you get worse, not more functional, and weaker. Your sex drive plummets...appetite, your sense of taste and smell. None of that was portrayed."" The poster did concede there was a scene where Adam was unsuccessful at sex, after experiencing exhaustion, but on the whole, I do believe he's right. While the film does imply Adam is ""cured' after his surgery, many times the illness comes back in a more virulent form a few years down the road. That's after all the intrusive and debilitating surgery as well as the side effects from chemotherapy.Perhaps the most realistic and true moment in 50/50 is when Adam breaks down inside the car and proclaims, ""I'm tired of it all"". The story devolves into an unlikely and quite sentimental romance between Adam and his therapist, who unethically gets involved with him at film's end. Angelica Huston tries for laughs at the beginning, playing an apparent, overbearing Jewish mother. Later, there are a few better heartfelt exchanges between mother and son.Perhaps the greatest disservice of a film such as 50/50 is how it fails to question the cancer establishment's unbridled faith in treatments such as chemotherapy. The gullibility of a character like Adam is the norm in our society. Instead of exploring alternative options, he fails to ask any questions of his oncologist, and blindly accepts his pronouncements. As it turns out, the practitioner is typical of many physicians today, who doesn't expect you to challenge him, and acts as if he has all the answers. As is usually the case, the chemo treatments turn out to be worse than the disease itself, killing the bad cells as well as the good, and destroying the quality of the patient's life.I found most of 50/50 to be a very unpleasant experience, because it implies there is only one way to treat cancer (chemo, radiation and surgery). While Gordon-Levitt does his best in a difficult part, Seth Rogen has proved to have worn out his welcome as a serious actor and should be relegated to roles on bad TV sitcoms--where hopefully he will disappear from the entertainment scene, sooner than later!",1,"No laughs in 'feel good' cancer movie, made worse by thoroughly obnoxious Seth Rogen performance",1327449600,"01 25,

Having never battled cancer myself, I found it difficult to make any judgement on the actions.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.  As he struggles to cope with the diagnosis & treatment of his disease, he is ""helped along"" (in a variety of different ways) by a greenhorn therapist (Anna Kendrick), his smothering mother (Anjelica Huston), and his ""best bud"" (Seth Rogen).There are times when this movie seems downright ridiculous and seems to veer from any coherent narrative.  However, there are also moments that will bring tears to your eyes.  It is a very strange flick in that sense.The reason for the strange-ness?  The crazy collection of characters present.  Levitt himself proves me than capable of carrying the show, and his relationship with ""Kendrick"" provides probably the best moments in the film.  But then there are the auxiliary cast, who you will alternately hate and appreciate in equal doses.  I'm usually a fan of complex characters, but in ""50/50"" I would actually use the word ""uneven"" to describe them.Thus, I have to give this film a middle-of-the-road rating for now (perhaps at some other point in my life I will appreciate it more/less).
