375316,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303451489,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 19]","This film was such taboo when it was released, and it still is today when you think about it.  I remember when I was younger my parents flipped when they caught me watching this on cable television, like it was an adult film or something.  What is titillating as a young kid is borderline ridiculous (or really just plain ridiculous) as an adult.  Honestly, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone wanted to make this movie.The film is a remake of a 1949 British film (I have not seen it but I just might since it is labeled as `classier' and this trash could have used some class) and it follows two cousins (kissing cousins) as they are left destitute on an island after the ship they are on explodes.  They are washed ashore with a crewman named Paddy who soon winds up drunk and in the water.  In other words; he dies.  This leaves the two youngsters, Emmeline and Richard, to fend for themselves, and they do this for years.  The movie follows them growing older and as they age they start to notice one another and soon the film becomes nothing more than a perverse look at two kids falling in love.The film is not helped by the two young actor's lack of talent.  I won't say that Shields hasn't developed some acting skill but here neither actor can make the material palatable.  Each of them can't seem to get a handle on their characters and maybe this is due to the fact that the script paints them as helplessly ignorant and ridiculously childish.Sure, they have been separated from the world since they were young (not `that' young though), but are we really expected to believe that they don't know what a skull is or that they have never seen a pregnant woman before?The film comes off rather tasteless as apposed to being a character study.  In a way this reminds me of `Showgirls', which was another one of those films that the director rallied behind trying to make it seem as if it was much more than simple trash.  This is not a smart movie, nor is it an effective film.  Director Richard Kleiser and writer Douglas Day Stewart should have intentionally strayed away from the obvious in order to build an air of longing the viewer.  If they had focused on the mental state of these two characters instead of their physical appearance then maybe this film would have morphed into something interesting and intelligent.The end of the film (which in itself is also a stretch) is tender in its own right and actually touched me a little, but to be honest it was not enough to warrant any respect.  As we watch these two characters make their way through life we don't feel as much for them as we do for the poor actors who portray them, for no actor should have to list this film of their r&eacute;sum&eacute;.",1,This is one trashy camp classic...,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2734,"['film', 'was', 'such', 'taboo', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'still', 'today', 'when', 'think', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'parents', 'flipped', 'when', 'caught', 'watching', 'cable', 'television', 'was', 'adult', 'film', 'something', 'What', 'titillating', 'young', 'kid', 'borderline', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'adult', 'Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie.The', 'film', 'remake', '1949', 'British', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'just', 'might', 'labeled', 'classier', 'trash', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'class', 'two', 'cousins', 'kissing', 'cousins', 'are', 'left', 'destitute', 'island', 'ship', 'are', 'explodes', 'are', 'washed', 'ashore', 'crewman', 'named', 'Paddy', 'who', 'soon', 'up', 'drunk', 'water', 'other', 'words', 'two', 'youngsters', 'Emmeline', 'Richard', 'fend', 'do', 'years', 'movie', 'growing', 'older', 'age', 'start', 'notice', 'one', 'soon', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'perverse', 'look', 'two', 'kids', 'falling', 'love.The', 'film', 'not', 'helped', 'two', 'young', 'actor', 'lack', 'talent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'Shields', ""n't"", 'developed', 'acting', 'skill', 'here', 'actor', 'can', 'make', 'material', 'palatable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'handle', 'characters', 'maybe', 'due', 'fact', 'script', 'helplessly', 'ignorant', 'ridiculously', 'childish.Sure', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'world', 'were', 'young', 'not', 'young', 'are', 'really', 'expected', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'skull', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'film', 'rather', 'tasteless', 'apposed', 'being', 'character', 'study', 'way', 'Showgirls', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'director', 'rallied', 'trying', 'make', 'seem', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'trash', 'not', 'smart', 'movie', 'effective', 'film', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Kleiser', 'writer', 'Douglas', 'Day', 'Stewart', 'should', 'have', 'intentionally', 'strayed', 'away', 'obvious', 'order', 'build', 'air', 'longing', 'viewer', 'had', 'focused', 'mental', 'state', 'two', 'characters', 'instead', 'physical', 'appearance', 'then', 'maybe', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'morphed', 'something', 'interesting', 'intelligent.The', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'stretch', 'tender', 'own', 'right', 'actually', 'touched', 'little', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'respect', 'watch', 'two', 'characters', 'make', 'way', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'poor', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'list', 'film', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute']",Blue Lagoon VHS

The stars,Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins were teenagers when this film was made. This film was another hit for director Randal Kleiser,who scored big with the 1978 Paramount musical GREASE. Subsequently,Kleiser directed HONEY,I BLEW UP THE KID which was a sequel to HONEY,I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The 1991 sequel to this film,RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, was a box office disappointment. In the summer of 1980 when this film was theatrically released,other hit movies from then include URBAN COWBOY and THE BLUES BROTHERS.

375322,A9QZBUCV1F1N3,6303451489,Cassie,"[3, 3]","I realize that many people may not agree with my rating here, at least if what you want is raw sex and a fast moving drama.  If that is what you desire, then this movie is not for you.  But if you are a sensitive person with feelings, and would like to see how it may feel to be able to live life without all the judgments and distractions of our modern society, then this drama may appeal to you, as it did with me.  It is an interesting phenomenon, when we are able to experience what is essential to understanding life in an environment where God's beauty shows through, it touches something deep inside of our heart as if to say, ""This is how God meant us to be and live!""  Is the acting perfect? No.  Is it a triple A picture?  Probably not.  But what it is may reach your heart in a way that most other movies simply cannot do.  Why?  Because it really shows everything in such an innocent and simple way that it becomes real; it shows things that in many ways are taboo in our society ... such as both the male and female bodies, but without being offensive in any way; learning about sex and having sex, while making it a beautiful and touching; and learning about the interactions and feelings of each other, which in the end results in caring and love for one another; and lastly, having a child and growing close as a family.  Simple?  Yes.  But touching, nevertheless.  Interestingly, I had a similar experience in my own life where, for the month that I spent with a cousin of mine in native bungalows in Bora Bora and Moorea (near Tahiti), we found that that simple something in this heavenly world of Polynesia can truly bring you closer to each other and to God.  We actually discovered an almost indescribable spiritual unity while swimming and living in this same kind of environment as is seen in this movie.

month away from 14..And like every boy my age i was captivated by this young teen beauty..Still as captivating today as it was then..To say this film is beautifully filmed is a massive understatement..And the DvD only heightens the exsperiance..I still wish they would release the original i believe from the 1940s..It is said that this is somewhat based on a true story of 2 children a boy and a girl who become stranded on a island..And grow up there together..When they hit teenage years they fall in love..There was much scandel about this being their age..But what these so called critics failed to mention in all that hoopla is that they grew up on the island..And didn't know how to deal with things such as puberty & sex..So they depended on their God given instincts..The movie is well acted by both Brooke and Christopher..And is a 1980s must if you are a collector of 80s movies..But sad to say there is some drawbacks on dvd *none of which are the movie itself..The movie is more then 5 stars*..And the scene of Brooke's Midnight Hour Swim in the Moonlight is erotic and i remember just heightened how much i was into her back in 1980..This scene is more then pure Magic and Mystical..Pure Fantasy at its finest..As Brooke swims laser lights dance with her in the water..Now that is what you call Paradise a Oasis..And listen to Brooke's commentary for more secrets about that ever CLASSIC scene..They are involved with the extras..The ""Original Featurette"" is in very pitiful terrible shape..And worse yet when it plays it stays on the ""title"" fuction so you can't even check into the running time of the featurette..The featurette is soooo hard to watch coz of the poor quality i never got more then 3 minutes into it..It looks like the footage is 100 years old..Shame on them for calling this a featurette..This great movie deserves soooo much better then this..The same with the ""Theatrical Trailor"" even though that did bring back memories of seeing that same trailor back in 1980 and it then made us know about the movie and the following weekend went to see it..And it is one of those double sided dvds which i find to be a real pain..They are hard to take care of ect ect ect..But don't let this all stop you from seeing this great film..But there is some great extras too..There are 2 different commentaries that you can listen to while viewing the film..1 is with Christopher and the other one is with Brooke..Wish they would have had them together instead of separate..Both comm are very fun to listen to..And the memories they share are priceless as well..They try to make you feel like you were there with them..Listen to both mostly the Brooke one *which of course is my fav*..I wish they would rerelease this in the theater coz to see it again on the big silver screen would be the ultimate..1980 was a year of 2 movies like that ""Windwalker"" and this movie..Filmwork at its finest..Get this dvd and relive the Magic..If you never seen it get it and be introduced to a 1980s movie that set the decade..And meet Brooke at Midnight In The Oasis..I Know I WiLL..",5,"""Brooke MemorieS My Island Girl""",1078617600,"03 7,

There were complaints about incest, but the two children are not brother and sister: Emmeline clearly addresses Arthur Lestrange as Uncle, while Richard calls him Father, so the closest they could be is cousins, and the use of Uncle may have been conventional (indicating guardianship) rather than literal. There were complaints about showing a 14-year-old actress nude, but they used body doubles for all of the nude scenes (Brooke Shields spends some of the commentary pointing which body double was used for which scene).The plot is fairly straightforward. A man, Arthur Lestrange (William Daniels), is taking two children, Emmeline (Elva Josephson) and Richard (Glenn Kohan), from Boston to San Francisco by sailing ship around the turn of the century (the date is not specified). Because the Panama Canal doesn't exist yet, they must travel right down to the bottom of South America to get around. After rounding the bottom, there's a fire aboard - something that is a serious concern, but in this case it is worse, because it is in a hold containing blasting powder, so the passengers are rowed away from the ship. In the confusion, the children are separated from Arthur Lestrange; they end up in a boat with Paddy, the ship's cook (Leo McKern). To make things worse, a heavy fog rolls in, the ship blows up, and they are adrift by themselves.Luck (and the scriptwriter) is with them, and they awaken within sight of an island. They are very fortunate to discover that this island has fresh water, ample fruit (bananas, papayas, and coconuts, amongst others), and is generally a tropical paradise. Paddy shows them various useful skills, including the construction of a hut, and collection of food, before dying. Now two fairly young children (I'm guessing they are under ten years) are alone. Years pass, and Richard (now Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (now Brooke Shields) are coping fairly well with the basics of feeding themselves, but they are going through a variety of traumas as their bodies change. Matters like Emmeline's first period are not glossed over - it's easy to see how terrifying that could be for a young girl with no idea of what is happening to her. Emotionally, the pair are still children, and they squabble and tease one another just as children do. There are a series of events (nope, I'm not saying what) that split them apart, then bring them back together. Yes, they do learn about sex, and that is also handled sensitively - it could have come across as pornographic, but it doesn't, it comes across as tender and caring. The consequences are handled well, too. Bear in mind that these children, back on the ship, were still at the ""cabbage patch"" stage of sex education...Providing you have a broad enough mind not to be scandalized by the nudity (which is utterly appropriate to the setting), this is a sweet love story set in a tropical paradise, a study of innocence, with enough drama to add seasoning.Recommended For fans OF Brooke Shields(of Calvin Klein blue jeans fame) and love stories.Gunner  January, 2008",4,Calvin Klein Jeans,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,3178,"['Blue', 'Lagoon', 'DVDIn', '1980', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'controversy', 'most', 'ill-founded', 'were', 'complaints', 'incest', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'brother', 'sister', 'Emmeline', 'clearly', 'Arthur', 'Lestrange', 'Uncle', 'Richard', 'Father', 'closest', 'could', 'be', 'cousins', 'use', 'Uncle', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'conventional', 'indicating', 'guardianship', 'rather', 'literal', 'were', 'complaints', 'showing', '14-year-old', 'actress', 'nude', 'used', 'body', 'doubles', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'commentary', 'pointing', 'body', 'double', 'was', 'used', 'scene', '.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'man', 'Arthur', 'Lestrange', 'William', 'Daniels', 'taking', 'two', 'children', 'Emmeline', 'Elva', 'Josephson', 'Richard', 'Glenn', 'Kohan', 'Boston', 'San', 'Francisco', 'sailing', 'ship', 'turn', 'century', 'date', 'not', 'specified', 'Panama', 'Canal', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', 'must', 'travel', 'right', 'down', 'bottom', 'South', 'America', 'get', 'around', 'rounding', 'bottom', 'fire', 'something', 'serious', 'concern', 'case', 'worse', 'hold', 'containing', 'blasting', 'powder', 'passengers', 'are', 'rowed', 'away', 'ship', 'confusion', 'children', 'are', 'separated', 'Arthur', 'Lestrange', 'end', 'up', 'boat', 'Paddy', 'ship', 'cook', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'heavy', 'fog', 'rolls', 'ship', 'up', 'are', 'adrift', 'themselves.Luck', 'scriptwriter', 'awaken', 'sight', 'island', 'are', 'very', 'fortunate', 'discover', 'island', 'fresh', 'water', 'ample', 'fruit', 'bananas', 'papayas', 'coconuts', 'others', 'generally', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'Paddy', 'various', 'useful', 'skills', 'including', 'construction', 'hut', 'collection', 'food', 'dying', 'Now', 'two', 'fairly', 'young', 'children', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'are', 'ten', 'years', 'are', 'alone', 'Years', 'pass', 'Richard', 'now', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'Emmeline', 'now', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'are', 'coping', 'fairly', 'well', 'basics', 'feeding', 'are', 'going', 'variety', 'traumas', 'bodies', 'change', 'Matters', 'Emmeline', 'first', 'period', 'are', 'not', 'glossed', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'terrifying', 'could', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'Emotionally', 'pair', 'are', 'still', 'children', 'squabble', 'tease', 'one', 'just', 'children', 'do', 'are', 'series', 'events', 'nope', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'what', 'split', 'apart', 'then', 'bring', 'back', 'together', 'Yes', 'do', 'learn', 'sex', 'also', 'handled', 'sensitively', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'pornographic', ""n't"", 'tender', 'caring', 'consequences', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'too', 'Bear', 'mind', 'children', 'back', 'ship', 'were', 'still', 'cabbage', 'patch', 'stage', 'sex', 'education', 'Providing', 'have', 'broad', 'enough', 'mind', 'not', 'be', 'scandalized', 'nudity', 'utterly', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'study', 'innocence', 'enough', 'drama', 'add', 'seasoning.Recommended', 'fans', 'OF', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'blue', 'jeans', 'fame', 'love', 'stories.Gunner', 'January', '2008']",Blue Lagoon VHS

It is a true story about natual love, the discovery of one's self, their bodies, their confusing feelings for one another as they hit man and womanhood. This film deals with a lot of issues- growing up on their own on a deserted island, their sexuality, masterbation, menstration, sex,parenthood. This film is wonderful. Never have I really seen a film that's not set in civillisation but is so entertaining for one but the story is just beautiful, and Brooke Shields as Emmeline and Christopher Atkins as Richard are fantastic. The musical score is truely beautiful and makes me feel a range of emotions. The first time I saw this film I was so fasinated by it, and was about the same age as the characters so I could relate to some of the emotions they were going through, the confusion of everything. Anyone thinking about buying this film-Go for it- You woun't regret it. As for the fans who have loved this film throught out the years, it was worth the wait. The Extras on the DVD are excellent. The two commentaries are very informative and I love listening to the Brooke Shields track and hearing her insight about the film and that time the film came out.

Baker ""book addict""","[2, 2]","I bought this film not knowing what I might find but after a few minutes in I found the most delightful film about two children who knew absolutely nothing TRUE about life. Their father, Mr. Lestrange (good name for him btw), told them nothing true about life. Babies from cabbage patches, etc. They had only a fairly good vague concept about God but a little knowledge is dangerous which it was in their case. They even fell for the idea that an idol was God. Oh how horrible! Anyway, this is the sweetest movie I have watched in a very long time. I love the ocean scenes, the Pacific shots of the sky and cocoa-palms. It all makes for an enchanting two hours. I have watched it over and over and hope to watch it again and again. I bought the sequel it would not load so I got a refund but I will review it for what I did see of it.Chris and Brooke do a marvelous acting job in this. It was so believeable that I just know they are really living their parts. They are innocence at it's best and the nude shots are so well done that you don't feel creepy or weird while watching them do whatever life brings them. It was all so well done that it was all so sweet as it could be. Again, not much creepiness anywhere in this film except for the headhunter scenes which I could have done without. I read about Robinson Cruso and so it took me back to those awful parts in that book. But, that was soon forgotten when a sunset appeared or a shot under the ocean took my mind off the gruesomeness of life. There is darkness in life but this movie lets one take a trip to a Pacific Islands and leave all worries behind for a while and just dream about being there. I watch it for that reason. It takes me away from the mundanness of my day and I am swept away.

375349,A7OJ1MOG5NQKL,6303451489,Mickey Babylon,"[4, 5]","Yep, I really did just say that. The Blue Lagoon is a perfect film. It stands alongside Raging Bull, Wild Strawberries, and the true titans of cinematic greatness as certainly the most surprising entry in that particular canon.It's a shipwreck movie, which is certainly a dubious gimmick in narrative. Almost all shipwreck stories suck, because it's such an obvious impetus for a writer to go native and force personal beliefs into fictional reality. Lord of the Flies is the most popular example of this, and what an unwatchable (or unreadable, as the case may be) story that turns out to be. It relies on ""allegory"", which is a French word meaning ""angry man rants for audience of whoever will listen to him"". Not good art.This story, however, takes the shipwreck story into the far more interesting and beautiful direction of stripping away socialization from its characters and allowing them to develop (both narratively and biologically) in a spirit of pure individuation. It concerns itself with how human beings behave instinctively, and hinges these concerns on observable reality (which is the only basis that counts with this sort of thing).It's sexual in ways only French films are supposed to be able to get away with, chauvinistic in ways only Italian films are supposed to be able to get away with, and amoral in ways only indie films are supposed to be able to get away with. Why is this not already considered a landmark art film?The cinematography? It's Nestor Almendros' finest work, and that's saying A LOT. The music? Good. The acting? Believe it or not, serviceable. The ending? There's room for interpretation, but if you subscribe to the interpretation of it that I hold, it's one of the most beautiful and poignant endings in all of cinema.In short, if you've happened upon this review in ignorance of the film in question, scroll up the page and buy this movie.

The controversy it created was enough to generate box office returns and made this into one of the most well known modern classics.  And yet, for me, it left many things to be desired.Brooke Sheilds and Christopher Atkins play Richard and Em, two kids who are the only survivors of a ship wreck on a desert island.  They are rescued by the ship's cook, a man named Patty, who manages to provide them with just enough survival skills (food, shelter, etc.), not to mention social and language skills to survive once he dies suddenly.  Being isolated and knowing nothing of the outside world, they will, naturally, go through puberty and somehow fall in love without really know what's going on.  They also have a baby, completely neive what to do with it and how to care for it, but, somehow, as primative people do, survive.There is much implied that isn't said in this movie.  Richard and Em just might be cousins.  They are practically naked throughout the entire movie, and made a million people cry ""kiddie porn"" (although he did use a body double for some of the more reveiling scenes showing Brooke's 14 year old breasts).  The special features are good, where Brooke and Chris recall each and every scene with all the amusing anecdotes that an experience like this would entail.  How embarrassing for Atkins to say that he was so short next to Shields that he had to wear lifts in scenes where they were walking side by side.  It was mostly about the lush setting, making Fiji probably the most romantic honeymoon spot for years to come.  It's hard to argue with a beautiful island place like Fiji.Still, this is a movie about happiness, innocence, and getting back to nature.

375362,A26WVK274IA7DN,6303451489,Sarah Bellum,"[10, 25]","**Possible spoilers**  In this infamous movie, Richard and Emmeline land as children on a remote island with the gruff but loveable Paddy. Not long after Paddy shows them the basics of survival, Paddy dies and the two youngsters are left all alone and forced to fend for themselves. Nature takes its course and it isn't long before the teenaged Emmeline becomes pregnant. What are the fates if these three? It would be all too easy to conclude this is a tale of morality, funded by a religious conservative group and filmed to warn kids and their parents about the dangers of sex before marriage, the price of ignorance and the importance of parental involvement in a child's life. A pregnant teen with no job, no health insurance and an unemployed husband, forced to live off the charity of others. Get thee to a nunnery. Yet I am going to go against the grain on this one and say that I don't think that was the purpose behind this film. If the goal was to serve as a warning, then why is there a happy ending even though there is no repentance? Certainly they must be made to pay for their sins?! This blatant effrontery and refutation of providence very obviously signifies an exercise of free will and desire for base pleasures. These children experience puberty in a very innocent and natural manner, without all the social stigmas and peer pressures that normally accompany this period of life. In this way, the film resembles a documentation of human development and a social study. Plot aside, the acting is not especially good, though it would be difficult for most of us to deliver some of these lines with a straight face.

375363,A16PM11CURP9US,6303451489,Shane Anthony,"[2, 2]","I was 14 when this film came out so it brings back wonderful memories of being a teenager and experiencing romance with a cute girl  for the first time. Sure some of the dialogue is a bit corny but you must remember these kids were shipwrecked when they were young so their knowledge about life in general and vocabulary would be somewhat limited. Brooke Shields looks stunning(duh!) though only 14 when she filmed this in '79, and Christopher Atkins(just 18 himself) does a good job as well considering this was his first film and he and Brooke are on screen alone for 3/4 of the movie. All the nudity that some critics and detractors have complained about over the past 33 years looks perfectly natural and beautiful. The human body is nothing to be ashamed of and if you grew up in the lush Fiji tropics like Richard & Emmeline you'd be running around butt naked most of the time too. :)What I cherish most about this film is how these kids discover the changes you go through from child to young adulthood on their own. Most of us had parents or relatives to teach us these things. Richard & ""Em"" rely on their inner feelings and stereopticon photographs to try and make sense of it all. It's confusing, frustrating, scary and exilirating all at the same time. There's something very poetic and tender about growing up in a world away from civilzation with no violence, hatred or societies pressures and expectations. It's just the laws of nature and each other.The great thing about movies is you can love them for different reasons for example: Jaws(primal fear of the ocean),The Godfather trilogy(ultimate saga about family,revenge,sacrifice and consequences),Aliens(brilliant pacing and relentless action),Goodfellas(inner workings of mob life), Braveheart,Ben-Hur & Lawrence of Arabia(epic scope in storytelling), Annie Hall & Manhattan(honesty and complexities of relationships), just to name a few. TBL may not be on that same level but it does take me back to those days of youthful imagination and discovering girls weren't so ""icky"" after all like few films can, and for that reason alone it's one of my favorites. It connects with me emotionally each time I view it.The recent Blu-Ray release from Twilight Time/Sony looks fabulous on Blu-Ray with it's original film grain in tact and no digital manipulation. The exotic sounds of wildlife and the ocean really come to life in dts-hdma. The discs features include an isolated musical track, short but vintage making of featurette, 2 excellent audio commentaries from Brooke & Chris and various teasers/trailers. Also have to give a big thumbs up to the wonderful score and beautiful cinematography. If you're a fan of the film then you can purchase without regret.Forget ""San Forisco"" The Blue Lagoon IS the place to be :)",5,Nostalgic memories from the summer of 1980,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2787,"['was', '14', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'being', 'teenager', 'experiencing', 'romance', 'cute', 'girl', 'first', 'time', 'Sure', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'corny', 'must', 'remember', 'kids', 'were', 'shipwrecked', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'so', 'knowledge', 'life', 'general', 'vocabulary', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'stunning', 'duh', 'only', '14', 'when', 'filmed', ""'79"", 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'just', '18', 'good', 'job', 'well', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Brooke', 'are', 'screen', 'alone', '3/4', 'movie', 'nudity', 'critics', 'detractors', 'have', 'complained', 'past', '33', 'years', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'beautiful', 'human', 'body', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'grew', 'up', 'lush', 'Fiji', 'tropics', 'Richard', 'Emmeline', ""'d"", 'be', 'running', 'around', 'butt', 'naked', 'most', 'time', 'too', 'What', 'cherish', 'most', 'film', 'how', 'kids', 'discover', 'changes', 'go', 'child', 'young', 'adulthood', 'own', 'Most', 'had', 'parents', 'relatives', 'teach', 'things', 'Richard', 'Em', 'rely', 'inner', 'feelings', 'stereopticon', 'photographs', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'confusing', 'frustrating', 'scary', 'exilirating', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'very', 'poetic', 'tender', 'growing', 'up', 'world', 'away', 'civilzation', 'violence', 'hatred', 'societies', 'pressures', 'expectations', 'just', 'laws', 'nature', 'other.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movies', 'can', 'love', 'different', 'reasons', 'example', 'Jaws', 'primal', 'fear', 'ocean', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'ultimate', 'saga', 'family', 'revenge', 'sacrifice', 'consequences', 'Aliens', 'brilliant', 'pacing', 'relentless', 'action', 'Goodfellas', 'inner', 'workings', 'mob', 'life', 'Braveheart', 'Ben-Hur', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'epic', 'scope', 'storytelling', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'honesty', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'TBL', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'level', 'take', 'back', 'days', 'youthful', 'imagination', 'discovering', 'girls', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'icky', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'reason', 'alone', 'one', 'favorites', 'emotionally', 'time', 'view', 'it.The', 'recent', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Twilight', 'Time/Sony', 'fabulous', 'Blu-Ray', 'original', 'film', 'grain', 'tact', 'digital', 'manipulation', 'exotic', 'sounds', 'wildlife', 'ocean', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'dts-hdma', 'discs', 'include', 'isolated', 'musical', 'track', 'short', 'vintage', 'making', 'featurette', '2', 'excellent', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Brooke', 'Chris', 'various', 'teasers/trailers', 'Also', 'have', 'give', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'wonderful', 'score', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'then', 'can', 'purchase', 'regret.Forget', 'San', 'Forisco', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'place', 'be']",Blue Lagoon VHS

Soon, however, the cook dies and the young boy and girl are left on their own.Days become years and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) and Richard (Christopher Atkins) make a home for themselves surrounded by exotic creatures and nature's beauty.

I prefer to air on the side of it being a classic. The film is the story of two young children who are shipwrecked together. It isn't long before they discover what makes boys different from girls and begin experimenting with sex. Eventually they concieve and Brooke's character bears a child. They face all sorts of hardships before the surprising ending (I won't spoil it). It's a fact that Brooke is dresssed rather scantily throiughout most of the film and she and her beau have several nude scenes (mostly underwater).

It wasn't until I was 29, married and had cable that I finally watched this contraversial film.  While I still think it more appropriate for the actors to have been 18 years old, rather than 14, due to the mature themes and nudity, this is not your hot and sweaty sex movie.  You can get that from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and just about any daytime/primetime TV, these days.  What the story is about is 2 cousins, eventually left on their own, trying to survive in an Eden-like paradise, with the innocence of children and the natural curiosities that adolescence brings on.  They love, gently and affectionately, they have a child, they are content.  When a ship nears, they make a mutual decision to remain on the island and not try to be rescued. In a word, they are complete.  While the acting overall was pretty pathetic, and the script trite in many places, there were some poignant moments; Em ""meeting"" God and laying flowers at his feet so they would not make Him mad and would go to Heaven.  Richard contemplating the bleached skeleton of Paddy and realizing his own eventual fate, as well as that of Em and his son. The mutual decisions not to be saved, as well as saying farewell to each other after eating poison berries, when accidently drifting out to sea. One cannot but be heartbroken when they are found asleep, rather than dead, because there will be no place in society for them.  They belong in paradise, and the director should have let them die. Even the music becomes sad rather than jubilant. Scenery gorgeous, a beautiful score, acting fairly bad.  So, why do we keep returning to Blue Lagoon?  Because wouldn't we all like to be marooned on a gorgeous tropical island with our perfect love and be left to live simple and fulfilling lives in paradise? 5 stars for the idea, 2-3 for acting, so gave it a 4.",4,Gentle story of discovery and love,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,1931,"['When', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'was', '17', 'parents', 'refused', 'allow', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', '29', 'married', 'had', 'cable', 'finally', 'watched', 'contraversial', 'film', 'still', 'think', 'more', 'appropriate', 'actors', 'have', 'been', '18', 'years', 'old', 'rather', '14', 'due', 'mature', 'themes', 'nudity', 'not', 'hot', 'sweaty', 'sex', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'just', 'daytime/primetime', 'TV', 'days', 'What', 'story', 'about', '2', 'cousins', 'eventually', 'left', 'own', 'trying', 'survive', 'Eden-like', 'paradise', 'innocence', 'children', 'natural', 'curiosities', 'adolescence', 'brings', 'love', 'gently', 'affectionately', 'have', 'child', 'are', 'content', 'When', 'ship', 'make', 'mutual', 'decision', 'remain', 'island', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'rescued', 'word', 'are', 'complete', 'acting', 'overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'script', 'trite', 'many', 'places', 'were', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Em', 'meeting', 'God', 'laying', 'flowers', 'feet', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'Him', 'mad', 'would', 'go', 'Heaven', 'Richard', 'contemplating', 'bleached', 'skeleton', 'Paddy', 'realizing', 'own', 'eventual', 'fate', 'as', 'well', 'Em', 'son', 'mutual', 'decisions', 'not', 'be', 'saved', 'as', 'well', 'saying', 'farewell', 'other', 'eating', 'poison', 'berries', 'when', 'accidently', 'drifting', 'out', 'sea', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'are', 'found', 'asleep', 'rather', 'dead', 'will', 'be', 'place', 'society', 'belong', 'paradise', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'die', 'Even', 'music', 'sad', 'rather', 'jubilant', 'Scenery', 'gorgeous', 'beautiful', 'score', 'acting', 'fairly', 'bad', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'keep', 'returning', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'marooned', 'gorgeous', 'tropical', 'island', 'perfect', 'love', 'be', 'left', 'live', 'simple', 'fulfilling', 'lives', 'paradise', '5', 'stars', 'idea', '2-3', 'acting', 'so', 'gave', '4']",Blue Lagoon VHS

Risoli ""black farmer""","[1, 4]","Going through some old music, I came across Basil Poledouris's ""Love Theme from 'The Blue Lagoon' (Emmeline)"" which was quite beautiful and I longed to see the movie again.  I had never seen the 1949 original with Jean Simmons and you know what they say now about remakes, but I had forgotten I had already seen the 1980 remake in the theater and did not appreciate the music as much nor even Nester Almendros's usually breathtaking cinematography and, of course, concentrated on the kids, Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, what everyone then went to see it for.  I forgot that they were not nearly as good as Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, Franco Zefferelli's young thespians when he made ""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1968 and they could really act and it was Shakespeare.  Brooke Shields went on to things, nothing weighty and Christopher Atkins soon after went off into the sunset already.  The second time watching this unfortunate story was murder.  Poledouris's music should have been heard more.  But watching it again has illustrated for me a lot of what is wrong with Hollywood then that our society has learned from awful popular movies especially the complete oeuvre of its director Randall Kleiser from ""Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" to ""Honey I Blew Up the Kids"" with the only real ""credit"" being 1978's ""Grease"" based on the stage musical.  It was commercial but carefully built its appeal to older audiences.  What that had surfaced after ""The Blue Lagoon"" in the commercialism was in 1982 with ""Summer Lovers"" which was all current songs on the soundtrack and what seemed like all future Cameron Diaz movies with Peter Gallagher as reigning beefcake (even somewhat androgynous) with the most simple plot or lack of it with those interchangeable titles, any title as good as any for just a copyrighted idea masquerading as a script or any Jennifer Aniston movie today.  Careful, V., she's stretching her acting range to play an (it doesn't add this word, but it's coming into the mix) ""aging"" stripper, or should I call it by its new politically correct word, ""a cougar.""  Anything to make the stultifying lack of entertainment and talent today more acceptable. (Anything with ""friends"" in the title or anything in the title ""friends"" do in their everyday life so we can sell it like a commodity like toothpaste and toilet paper).  I don't think there will be much future for a lot of these movies once new abominations can serve as landmarks when the new generations must look back on what it has wrought and maybe the really good things will be appreciated again even more.  Restoration should be the thing of the future.  Based on a 1903 novel by Henry DeVere Stacpoole, but more like Demi Moore's ""The Scarlet Letter.""  Color.  Columbia Pictures.
