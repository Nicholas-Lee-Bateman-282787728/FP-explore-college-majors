1114330,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000XJ5UEE,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 2]","""Day Zero"" is an odd indie movie. It's one of the few indie movies addressing the Iraq War,but that's no quality assurance. It's a bizarre blend of conservative patriotism with the Lifetime Channel. The soundtrack is drab&forgettable--when; Azam Ali's stratospheric singing,Natacha Atlas' enchanting melismas,and Rihanna's ""Disturbia"" would've been a better fit.""Day Zero"" is set during the month when three friends,George (Chris Klein,Katie Holmes' ex),Dixon (Jon Bernthal) and Aaron (Elijah Wood) have learned they've been drafted and how they cope. George has a wife suffering from the Disease of the Week (Ginnifer Goodwin,the third wife in HBO's Big Love) Aaron is a fantasy writer--how ironic-his first book is about a hero going to a volcano. Dixon is a taxi driver. They meet at the bar to get preachy about the war. It's so obvious and heavy-handed it makes the Hallmark Channel look gritty.George has a hard time coping. He thinks of being a conscientious objector, then he tries to cut off a finger. Finally, he decides to pretend to be gay by bringing Aaron with him to the local gay bar. Surprisingly, they don't pretend to be a couple (fanfiction makes more sense) George starts a fight.Dixon gets an Instant Romance and Instant Sex. He's a good character, Bernthal is a talented actor, but he doesn't get much to do. He even gets prefab conflict when he reveals to his new girlfriend that he's off to war.Aaron,as is expected,is a naif who is driven to madness (there's a 9 hour version,if you're up to it) He bores his therapist (Ally Sheedy),a woman he brings home from the bar,and even a prostitute with his acting. Thankfully, Aaron loses his shirt often and uses a Bowflex. To the fangirl dismay, he doesn't enjoy the gay bar, nor does he even pretend to be George's lover. Aaron gets his head shaved&tattooed.; He goes mad.""Day Zero"" has all the cliches one would expect in a movie. It's all cardboard characters and a contrived plot. Bernthal and Goodwin are the only convincing actors. ""Day Zero"" is a bad Iraq War movie,but at least it's a Bad Iraq War Movie We Love.",3,The Fellowship of the Cliche,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,2091,"['Day', 'Zero', 'odd', 'indie', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'indie', 'movies', 'addressing', 'Iraq', 'War', 'quality', 'assurance', 'bizarre', 'blend', 'conservative', 'patriotism', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'soundtrack', 'drab', 'forgettable', 'when', 'Azam', 'Ali', 'stratospheric', 'singing', 'Natacha', 'Atlas', 'enchanting', 'melismas', 'Rihanna', 'Disturbia', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'fit', 'Day', 'Zero', 'set', 'month', 'when', 'three', 'friends', 'George', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'ex', 'Dixon', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'Aaron', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'have', 'learned', ""'ve"", 'been', 'drafted', 'how', 'cope', 'George', 'wife', 'suffering', 'Disease', 'Week', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'third', 'wife', 'HBO', 'Big', 'Love', 'Aaron', 'fantasy', 'writer', 'how', 'ironic-his', 'first', 'book', 'hero', 'going', 'volcano', 'Dixon', 'taxi', 'driver', 'meet', 'bar', 'get', 'preachy', 'war', 'so', 'obvious', 'heavy-handed', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'look', 'gritty.George', 'hard', 'time', 'coping', 'being', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'then', 'cut', 'off', 'finger', 'Finally', 'pretend', 'be', 'gay', 'bringing', 'Aaron', 'local', 'gay', 'bar', 'Surprisingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'couple', 'fanfiction', 'more', 'sense', 'George', 'fight.Dixon', 'Instant', 'Romance', 'Instant', 'Sex', 'good', 'character', 'Bernthal', 'talented', 'actor', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'do', 'even', 'prefab', 'conflict', 'when', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'war.Aaron', 'expected', 'naif', 'who', 'driven', 'madness', '9', 'hour', 'version', ""'re"", 'up', 'therapist', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'woman', 'home', 'bar', 'even', 'prostitute', 'acting', 'Thankfully', 'Aaron', 'shirt', 'often', 'Bowflex', 'fangirl', 'dismay', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'gay', 'bar', 'even', 'pretend', 'be', 'George', 'lover', 'Aaron', 'head', 'shaved', 'tattooed', 'mad', 'Day', 'Zero', 'cliches', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'contrived', 'plot', 'Bernthal', 'Goodwin', 'are', 'only', 'convincing', 'actors', 'Day', 'Zero', 'bad', 'Iraq', 'War', 'movie', 'least', 'Bad', 'Iraq', 'War', 'Movie', 'Love']",N/A
1114331,A23Y42R52F1LM9,B000XJ5UEE,Arch,"[3, 4]","I have given this movie 3 stars, because, although the movie had my attention. There was too much cussing for me. I don't think that a person has to cuss to get their point across.That said, this movie was a thinker. How would men feel today, if they were drafted to go fight in a war? Better yet, how did men feel back in the day, when they were drafted to go fight a war? Poor thing, a lot of these men were scared and I wouldn't blame them. Your life is on the line. Not only that, you can die a lonely death. Meaning, you could get killed and leave behind your wife, wife/children, family and friends.A lot of men wants to fight for their country, but for a lot of men, ""The Army"" is not their cup of tea.I know that the three best friends in this movie, wasn't the only ones that have received drafted letters, but Day Zero focused on their bond.The three friends are:James Dixon, played by Jon Bernthal: The Taxi Driver. He came from a broken home. His wife treated his mother like dirt. Out of all three of the guys, he was the protector. He had his friends back. He even beat up guys for his friends. He was the one that wanted to go to the army. Was he scared? Yes, he was. Even more so, when it came close to going.George Rifkin, played by Chris Klein. He was the lawyer. Came from a rich family. Married to a woman that had cancer. He didn't want to go to the army. He wanted to figure our ways to get out of it. He had his daddy call the senator to get him out. The man was even thinking about cutting his hand off or fingers off to save him from going to the army. He attempted to do it, but didn't.LOL, then there's Aaron Feller, played by Elijah Wood. He's the writer.  I have to say that Elijah is a good actor. He really played this role. He was the nerd of the group. He was scared of going to the army. He made a list of 10 things he wanted to do, before he went to the army. The anxiety has gotten to him. He kind of lost it. He was going to go to the army, but I believe the phone call to his sister, made him decide against it and caused him to kill himself. He jumped off a building. He found out that his father had a heart attack, but was doing fine and his sister basically ended the call. She didn't want to really talk to him. What happen, to where he was estranged from his family, I don't know. The movie doesn't really shed that light. But, one thing though, he had been seeing a shrink Prior to him, killing himself, I don't believe that he wrote down his number ten thing that he wanted to do, prior to going to the army. I believe, he wanted to do something, but replaced it with  killing himself. It wasn't as if he had family backing him up. Family is needed.He had me laughing in this movie. He had been going to a shrink for seven years, but didn't know how long he has been going to this female shrink. She had to let him know, how long he has been going to see her. His shrink was funny, because she wouldn't really be paying attention to him. She would be doing a puzzle, while he was just talking. I have to say, if I had to see a shrink and pay money, he or she better pay attention to me.Poor baby, made me a laugh, when he felt that he was both skinny and fat. He also made me laugh, because he picked up a woman at a bar and took her back to his place. What was funny about it was that he used her as a shrink to talk.So, one friend kills himself and the other two showed up at 7:00 a.m. to the drafting place. The question is, who really went to the army?The movie ended without making that clear.So, besides the cussing. The movie was okay.",3,How Would Being Drafted Makes Men Feel?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[32, 34]","What if the draft were reinstated, and the young men of the United States suddenly forced to join the army, fight, and perhaps die -- without any free choice?Thankfully, that hasn't happened just yet, and hopefully it won't anytime soon. But ""Day Zero"" takes a hard, sometimes frightening look at three young men who face that very ordeal. Instead of pompous politics or big war stories, it's an intimate, visceral experience that seems more interested in the ""ordinary guys"" than in the war itself.In the near future, terrorists have struck again, this time attacking the West Coast -- and in response, the United States has reactivated the draft. All males between eighteen and thirty-five have to sign up for army duty in one month. This includes three friends: street smart cabbie Dixon (Jon Bernthal), wealthy young lawyer George (Chris Klein), and fragile writer Aaron (Elijah Wood).In the month that follows, all three are struggling --  George wants to stay with his newly cancer-free wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) rather than fight in a war he despises, and tries to arrange an excuse to stay behind. Dixon's new girlfriend leaves him wondering what he'll lose if he leaves. And Aaron is just terrified. He makes a ""ten things to do in the next month"" list, but his fragile psyche starts to crumble under his fear of army life and death.As Day Zero approaches, all three men must find the pressure building to new heights, and must decide where their choices -- and futures -- lie.""Day Zero"" is not a cheerful movie -- despite a lack of boot camps, battlefields and pompous political preaching, this movie is pretty dark fare.  It's more interested in the hearts of drafted young men, and how they react -- how they react to the news, and how their potential loss affects their loved ones. And of course, the question of whether having a loved one gives you something to stay for.And first-time director Bryan Gunnar Cole does a pretty serviceable job. He slowly builds the tensions to a snapping point -- there are lots of raw emotional outbursts, and the entire movie has a cloud of dark inevitability hanging over it like a nasty ghost. Thee are a few flaws -- some patches of dud dialogue, and the embarrassing gay-bar screamfest -- are simply embarrassing to watch.Despite the dark tone, Cole does manage to weave in some comic moments, mostly from Aaron, his Bowflex, and his hilariously insensitive shrink. But these humorous moments have a tragic twist, even as they make the darker moments go down more easily.Klein gives the weakest performance of the bunch, especially since George is such a blatantly unsympathetic character -- not to mention that Klein's performance is wooden, lackluster, and rather boring. While Dixon's background is rather cliched, Bernthal does a more solid job as a hothead who actually gets something to love -- and lose -- and has to grow up a bit.Goodwin gives a solid, intense performance as a woman who has just regained her future, and she easily overshadows Klein. And Wood has the most challenging role: a man too fragile and sensitive to cope with his own fears, let alone the army. His downward spiral might have seemed silly in another actor's hands, but here it's just painfully stunning and pitiable. Few actors have the skill to pull off that breakdown.It's worth noting that despite its flaws, ""Day Zero's"" goal is not to change your mind or your war stance, but simply to give you something to think about, and in that, it succeeds. Definitely worth seeing, and worth mulling over once it's over.",4,Day zero approaches,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,3551,"['What', 'draft', 'were', 'reinstated', 'young', 'men', 'United', 'States', 'suddenly', 'forced', 'join', 'army', 'fight', 'perhaps', 'die', 'free', 'choice', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'happened', 'just', 'yet', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'anytime', 'soon', 'Day', 'Zero', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'look', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'face', 'very', 'ordeal', 'Instead', 'pompous', 'politics', 'big', 'war', 'stories', 'intimate', 'visceral', 'experience', 'more', 'interested', 'ordinary', 'guys', 'war', 'near', 'future', 'terrorists', 'have', 'struck', 'again', 'time', 'attacking', 'West', 'Coast', 'response', 'United', 'States', 'reactivated', 'draft', 'males', 'eighteen', 'thirty-five', 'have', 'sign', 'up', 'army', 'duty', 'one', 'month', 'three', 'friends', 'street', 'smart', 'cabbie', 'Dixon', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'wealthy', 'young', 'lawyer', 'George', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'fragile', 'writer', 'Aaron', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'month', 'three', 'are', 'struggling', 'George', 'stay', 'newly', 'cancer-free', 'wife', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'rather', 'fight', 'war', 'tries', 'arrange', 'excuse', 'stay', 'behind', 'Dixon', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'wondering', 'what', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'Aaron', 'just', 'terrified', 'ten', 'things', 'do', 'next', 'month', 'list', 'fragile', 'psyche', 'crumble', 'fear', 'army', 'life', 'death.As', 'Day', 'Zero', 'approaches', 'three', 'men', 'must', 'find', 'pressure', 'building', 'new', 'heights', 'must', 'decide', 'where', 'choices', 'futures', 'lie', 'Day', 'Zero', 'not', 'cheerful', 'movie', 'lack', 'boot', 'camps', 'battlefields', 'pompous', 'political', 'preaching', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dark', 'fare', 'more', 'interested', 'hearts', 'drafted', 'young', 'men', 'how', 'react', 'how', 'react', 'news', 'how', 'potential', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'course', 'question', 'having', 'loved', 'one', 'something', 'stay', 'for.And', 'first-time', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Gunnar', 'Cole', 'pretty', 'serviceable', 'job', 'slowly', 'tensions', 'snapping', 'point', 'are', 'lots', 'raw', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'entire', 'movie', 'cloud', 'dark', 'inevitability', 'hanging', 'nasty', 'ghost', 'Thee', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'patches', 'dud', 'dialogue', 'embarrassing', 'gay-bar', 'screamfest', 'are', 'simply', 'embarrassing', 'watch.Despite', 'dark', 'tone', 'Cole', 'manage', 'weave', 'comic', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Aaron', 'Bowflex', 'hilariously', 'insensitive', 'shrink', 'humorous', 'moments', 'have', 'tragic', 'twist', 'even', 'make', 'darker', 'moments', 'go', 'down', 'more', 'easily.Klein', 'weakest', 'performance', 'bunch', 'especially', 'George', 'such', 'blatantly', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'Klein', 'performance', 'wooden', 'lackluster', 'rather', 'boring', 'Dixon', 'background', 'rather', 'cliched', 'Bernthal', 'more', 'solid', 'job', 'hothead', 'who', 'actually', 'something', 'love', 'lose', 'grow', 'up', 'bit.Goodwin', 'solid', 'intense', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'regained', 'future', 'easily', 'Klein', 'Wood', 'most', 'challenging', 'role', 'man', 'too', 'fragile', 'sensitive', 'cope', 'own', 'fears', 'let', 'alone', 'army', 'downward', 'spiral', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'silly', 'actor', 'hands', 'here', 'just', 'painfully', 'stunning', 'pitiable', 'Few', 'actors', 'have', 'skill', 'pull', 'off', 'breakdown.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'flaws', 'Day', 'Zero', 'goal', 'not', 'change', 'mind', 'war', 'stance', 'simply', 'give', 'something', 'think', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'worth', 'mulling', 'over']",N/A
1114333,AKUGGJWVJ8QMQ,B000XJ5UEE,"Edward C. Patterson ""Edward C. Patterson""","[14, 17]","It's 30 days before DAY ZERO, when three friends are to be drafted into the army during the raging war in Iraq. They react to the news and somehow come to terms with reality. On this simple (even thin) premise, Bryan Cole crafts a well balanced 90 minutes, which manages to cloud a specific or biased point-of-view. Sure, there's anti-war clambering and patriotic posturing. There's plenty of flag waving and flag burning, but this film is not about the draft or serving one's country. As a reviewer who has already been drafted to face a war (in Viet-nam) and had to grapple with decisions that would ultimately shape the remainder of my life, I know this film is about ""the inner self""--the draft being the catalyst and the reactions mere symptoms to the rumbling of the human spirit or the lack there of.The three stars carry the film a long way and beyond. Chris Klein as George Rifkin represents the majority view, that the draft is a life interrupter. One never gets the impression that George is a coward. He just wants to continue his law practice, enjoy his family and wife; and ultimately, his anti-draft stance festers from resentment to anger. Jon Bernthal as James Dixon represents the patriotic view, that ""it had to happen sooner or later,"" and everyone should stand up and fight terrorism. He is a violent and disturbed man, short fused and drives a taxi for a living, quite a contrast from George. He imprints his views on his friends without hesitation, but when he meets a girl, his views are somewhat tempered. Elijah Wood, in his best performance on screen to date (yes, even better than Mr. Baggins), plays Aaron Feller, a nave, fragile man, who has just published his first novel and is working on the second. He is thrown into a panic by the draft notice. He looks for help in all the right places, and doesn't find it. He then looks in all the wrong places, and does. He manages to face his inner demon and takes the appropriate corrective action.The three friends interact with great chemistry. While Wood carries the film's main theme and presents it with pathos and comedy, the more political and preachy messages come from Klein and Bernthal. Bernthal's raging approach to life is engaging. He is always there for his friends, but not without cost. He chews up the scenery. Klein, on the other hand, gets the more conventional row to hoe, with everything from draft dodger to conscientious objector. He whines and bleats and tears his hair out (figuratively. Wood loses his, literally). Between Bernthal and Klein, we have Macbeth and King Lear, so it is up to Wood to bring the real interest. He crafts his character from thin air, as his scenes are mostly interspersed vignettes that are visually appealing and pathetically comic. In fact, Wood's sense of comedic timing matches the great stars of cinema, like Chaplin. He takes us from entertaining comic relief to riveting drama as Aaron takes a roller coaster ride from nave to psychosis in 30 days to Day Zero.This film has only been screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, where I am sure it will win awards and be picked up by a distributor (if not, the film industry is blind). It demonstrates that in the hands of a thinking director, three strong actors can create storms in tea cups. It also provides the viewing audience with Elijah Wood's best of many great performances on celluloid, and for an actor nearing his 40th film, it is a landmark.",5,Best Elijah Wood Performance to Date,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3434,"['30', 'days', 'DAY', 'ZERO', 'when', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'be', 'drafted', 'army', 'raging', 'war', 'Iraq', 'react', 'news', 'somehow', 'come', 'terms', 'reality', 'simple', 'even', 'thin', 'premise', 'Bryan', 'Cole', 'well', 'balanced', '90', 'minutes', 'cloud', 'specific', 'biased', 'point-of-view', 'Sure', 'anti-war', 'clambering', 'patriotic', 'posturing', 'plenty', 'flag', 'waving', 'flag', 'burning', 'film', 'not', 'draft', 'serving', 'one', 'country', 'reviewer', 'who', 'already', 'been', 'drafted', 'face', 'war', 'Viet-nam', 'had', 'grapple', 'decisions', 'would', 'ultimately', 'shape', 'remainder', 'life', 'know', 'film', 'inner', 'self', 'draft', 'being', 'catalyst', 'reactions', 'mere', 'symptoms', 'rumbling', 'human', 'spirit', 'lack', 'three', 'stars', 'carry', 'film', 'long', 'way', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'George', 'Rifkin', 'majority', 'view', 'draft', 'life', 'interrupter', 'One', 'never', 'impression', 'George', 'coward', 'just', 'continue', 'law', 'practice', 'enjoy', 'family', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'anti-draft', 'stance', 'festers', 'resentment', 'anger', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'James', 'Dixon', 'patriotic', 'view', 'had', 'happen', 'sooner', 'later', 'everyone', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'terrorism', 'violent', 'disturbed', 'man', 'short', 'fused', 'taxi', 'living', 'quite', 'contrast', 'George', 'views', 'friends', 'hesitation', 'when', 'girl', 'views', 'are', 'somewhat', 'tempered', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'best', 'performance', 'screen', 'date', 'yes', 'even', 'better', 'Mr.', 'Baggins', 'Aaron', 'Feller', 'nave', 'fragile', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'published', 'first', 'novel', 'working', 'second', 'thrown', 'panic', 'draft', 'notice', 'help', 'right', 'places', ""n't"", 'find', 'then', 'wrong', 'places', 'face', 'inner', 'demon', 'appropriate', 'corrective', 'action.The', 'three', 'friends', 'interact', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Wood', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'presents', 'pathos', 'comedy', 'more', 'political', 'preachy', 'messages', 'come', 'Klein', 'Bernthal', 'Bernthal', 'raging', 'approach', 'life', 'engaging', 'always', 'friends', 'not', 'cost', 'up', 'scenery', 'Klein', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'conventional', 'row', 'hoe', 'everything', 'draft', 'dodger', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'bleats', 'tears', 'hair', 'figuratively', 'Wood', 'literally', 'Between', 'Bernthal', 'Klein', 'have', 'Macbeth', 'King', 'Lear', 'Wood', 'bring', 'real', 'interest', 'crafts', 'character', 'thin', 'air', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'interspersed', 'vignettes', 'are', 'visually', 'appealing', 'pathetically', 'comic', 'fact', 'Wood', 'sense', 'comedic', 'timing', 'great', 'stars', 'cinema', 'Chaplin', 'entertaining', 'comic', 'relief', 'riveting', 'drama', 'Aaron', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'nave', 'psychosis', '30', 'days', 'Day', 'Zero.This', 'film', 'only', 'been', 'screened', 'Tribeca', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'win', 'awards', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'distributor', 'not', 'film', 'industry', 'blind', 'hands', 'thinking', 'director', 'three', 'strong', 'actors', 'can', 'create', 'storms', 'tea', 'cups', 'also', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'best', 'many', 'great', 'performances', 'celluloid', 'actor', 'nearing', '40th', 'film', 'landmark']",N/A

I have served and deployed, and was looking forward to seeing this movie and getting the other side's point of view in this controversial conflict of ours, but I felt there were a few things lacking.(1) I know this was to serve the purpose of the movie, but it's just unusually stark coincidence that three men were drafted and all three just happen to be friends.  What a random lot there.(2)  I expected more reactions and/or protests from the wife, girlfriend, little sister, etc. especially since the was going through chemotherapy.  The women were practically mute.  Too much focus was on the reactions of the three main characters.(3) Hated the ending.(4) Speaking of ending, when the friends decided to show up at Pennsylvania Station where they were supposed to report, where were all the other draftees?  I would have expected more extras or draftees or other scenes of draftees.Overall, a great premise.  Not a bad idea.  This would have made a great play, but movie-wise, I would have expected a little bit more authenticity.  A  little bit more protesting/commenting/wise-cracking/sympathy from the locals.

1114335,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000XJ5UEE,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","The Draft as a means for supplying the armed forces with manpower ended with the Vietnam War.  DAY ZERO is a thought provoking film that raises the question of how today's youth would respond were the Draft reinstated as a result of the ever-growing Iraq War. Writer Robert Malkani and director Bryan Gunnar Cole respond to the question by creating three characters, long time friends, but each with a different response to the forced servitude in a wartime situation. As with any film dealing with controversial subject matter there are ideas presented that will disturb just about everyone no matter their stance on compulsive servitude, and it is that aspect that makes this film work so well in jolting our thinking.The time is New York, now, and the media has just announced the reinstatement of the Draft to cope with the drained national volunteer army.  Three friends receive their draft notices simultaneously: successful lawyer George Rifkin (Chris Klein) whose marriage to a cancer survivor wife Molly (Ginnifer Goodwin) is part of the solid state of life he resists changing; fantasy writer Aaron Feller (Elijah Wood) who is in progress on a novel he must finish while his life is otherwise rather on shaky ground, controlled by his loopy therapist (Ally Sheedy); cab driver James Dixon (Jon Bernthal) who has a past history of being a loner and attempting to control violent behavior. The gamut runs from refusal to even consider the draft (Rifkin) to being nonplussed by the disruption to his psyche (Feller) to gung-ho ready to fight Dixon.  The three young men have thirty days to Day Zero and in those thirty days each undergoes profound changes and introspection and self-discovery that very keenly illustrates the effect that such a governmental edict can have on today's youth.This is ensemble acting that rivals that of any fine film: there are no stars here, only actors portraying emotional changes that are universal in nature. And for a first film by director Cole it succeeds on most levels.  In addition to the work of the four main actors there are fine cameos by young Sofia Vassilieva and by Elisabeth Moss. The film is meant to raise questions, challenge our current complacency and our views of the concept or war and military obligation. That it is disturbing is part of the power of the work.

1114336,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000XJ5UEE,Jason,"[3, 3]","Day Zero takes an honest look at what would likely happen if the draft were reinstituted today.  With insight from three social tiers, the creators do a good job of displaying how military service - and in large part the world - is viewed by people of different means.  Without being too preachy or political, the movie nonetheless delves into a very touchy subject that is sure to spark debate in today's polarized political climate.Three friends, George Rifkin (Chris Klein) a lawyer; Aaron Feller (Elijah Wood) an author; and James Dixon (Jon Bernthal) a cab driver, are all given their draft notice in the mail on the same day.  Each must come to terms with their obligation to serve, as their daily lives, thoughts, and decisions are exposed.George is from a wealthy family and he has done well for himself.  He is obviously opposed to the draft, the war, and whatever takes him away from his oh-so-important life.  It's painfully obvious that George feels that the draft is for the less-rich people, and his character is dispicably unlikable from his first utterance.  Aaron, the nervous, weakling writer, is nervous from the start, shivering and whimpering like a cold, wet chihuahua.  He senses he has no choice, and begins to look into how his dormant lifestyle has ill-prepared him for his future military service.  Finally, James is a cab driver, and as a blue-collar worker, he is predictably gung-ho about the potential of future military service.  There really is a clear indication of the feeling of entitlement and individuality that accompanies wealth, and a sense of purpose within groups that the poor often gravitate towards.In 50+ years since WWII, it often times seems the United States has morphed from a country where many associated with JFK's aforementioned famous words, to a land faced with moral, ethical, and social decay.  Whereas previous generations raised together through the same hardships engendered a shared feeling of responsibility, some may even say forming a national ""family"", the absence of that bond has created an odd anti-jingoism.  Some of this feeling may be in response to actions perceived as actual jingoism, and some is Hollywood-influenced self-loathing, where it's cool to be anti-establishment and/or aligned with those who have grown to view patriotism as a secondary interest.  It's no surprise that many revere previous generations, yet refer to current generations with epithets like ""precious snowflakes"".  It's an indictment of the individualism of this country, where young people are more concerned with self versus the greater, national interests, and the concept of selfless devotion required in something like a victory garden would be met with derision from the apathetic, morbidly obese.This movie does a good job of raising the questions and concerns related to a reinstated draft.  Given the fact that I'm a former soldier, and that I've seen the first-hand usage of conscription in another country - with success and pride, I might add - there is no doubt that I would proudly serve again if called upon, and the questions brought up by this movie only strengthen my resolve to do so.",4,Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,3156,"['Day', 'Zero', 'honest', 'look', 'what', 'would', 'likely', 'happen', 'draft', 'were', 'reinstituted', 'today', 'insight', 'three', 'social', 'tiers', 'creators', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'displaying', 'how', 'military', 'service', 'large', 'part', 'world', 'viewed', 'people', 'different', 'means', 'being', 'too', 'preachy', 'political', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'touchy', 'subject', 'sure', 'spark', 'debate', 'today', 'polarized', 'political', 'climate.Three', 'friends', 'George', 'Rifkin', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'lawyer', 'Aaron', 'Feller', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'author', 'James', 'Dixon', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'cab', 'driver', 'are', 'given', 'draft', 'notice', 'mail', 'same', 'day', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'obligation', 'serve', 'daily', 'lives', 'thoughts', 'decisions', 'are', 'exposed.George', 'wealthy', 'family', 'done', 'well', 'obviously', 'opposed', 'draft', 'war', 'away', 'oh-so-important', 'life', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'George', 'feels', 'draft', 'less-rich', 'people', 'character', 'dispicably', 'unlikable', 'first', 'utterance', 'Aaron', 'nervous', 'weakling', 'writer', 'nervous', 'start', 'shivering', 'whimpering', 'cold', 'wet', 'chihuahua', 'choice', 'look', 'how', 'dormant', 'lifestyle', 'ill-prepared', 'future', 'military', 'service', 'Finally', 'James', 'cab', 'driver', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'predictably', 'gung-ho', 'potential', 'future', 'military', 'service', 'really', 'clear', 'indication', 'feeling', 'entitlement', 'individuality', 'wealth', 'sense', 'purpose', 'groups', 'poor', 'often', 'gravitate', 'towards.In', '50+', 'years', 'WWII', 'often', 'United', 'States', 'morphed', 'country', 'where', 'many', 'associated', 'JFK', 'aforementioned', 'famous', 'words', 'land', 'faced', 'moral', 'ethical', 'social', 'decay', 'Whereas', 'previous', 'generations', 'raised', 'together', 'same', 'hardships', 'engendered', 'shared', 'feeling', 'responsibility', 'may', 'even', 'say', 'forming', 'national', 'family', 'absence', 'bond', 'created', 'odd', 'anti-jingoism', 'feeling', 'may', 'be', 'response', 'actions', 'perceived', 'actual', 'jingoism', 'Hollywood-influenced', 'self-loathing', 'where', 'cool', 'be', 'anti-establishment', 'and/or', 'aligned', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'view', 'patriotism', 'secondary', 'interest', 'surprise', 'many', 'revere', 'previous', 'generations', 'yet', 'refer', 'current', 'generations', 'epithets', 'precious', 'snowflakes', 'indictment', 'individualism', 'country', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'self', 'greater', 'national', 'interests', 'concept', 'selfless', 'devotion', 'required', 'something', 'victory', 'garden', 'would', 'be', 'met', 'derision', 'apathetic', 'morbidly', 'obese.This', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'raising', 'questions', 'concerns', 'related', 'reinstated', 'draft', 'Given', 'fact', ""'m"", 'former', 'soldier', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first-hand', 'usage', 'conscription', 'country', 'success', 'pride', 'might', 'add', 'doubt', 'would', 'proudly', 'serve', 'again', 'called', 'upon', 'questions', 'brought', 'up', 'movie', 'only', 'strengthen', 'resolve', 'do', 'so']",N/A

E.,"[3, 4]","Spoiler Alert-I was not sure what to expect when beginning to watch this and from the first 15 minutes or so I would say it was your average movie with an interesting subject of the draft in the current times (even with the government changing it to 35 years old-yeah right). Then as the movie wore on (A therapist who wasn't paying attention to her patient and he doesn't care, the taxi driver friend  verbally berates his 15 years known lawyer friend as well as punches him at a party, another trying to get his fathers connections to get him out of the draft) it slowly drifted into a 2 movie. Then about half way through it just got worse and moved into a HARD one-star (guy tries to cut his thumb off as lying just won't work to get out of the draft, taxi driver friends now verbally berates the writer friend, taxi driver friend talks about his hard [wah wah] family life like anyone watching would care about this person, writer friend loses it at the end).All above is good enough for a one star but there was another thing that peeved me. I have never seen a movie that I recall in where it would like you to be concerned for the characters but instead made you loath each and everyone of them by the end. Case in point, after beating up a pimp later in the movie (a scene subsequent to him punching his best friend) he exclaims ""Do you think I like doing this?"" and we all should really see life from his point view. Uh-NO. This is the same guy who after knowing he is going to the draft starts a relationship and just is so ""hurt"" when he has to tell her he's leaving all while spouting off to all his friends to be less ""self-centered."" Even Elijah Wood's character admits to ""plagiarism"" and by movie end shaves his head and gets tattoos in a complete contradiction of the character he has displayed in the movie. Oh and Mr. Movie wants you to be sympathetic to him too.

Bryan Gunnar Cole, who has done some editing work in television, directed his first feature.  Rob Malkani who wrote the screenplay for ""Dot.Kill"" also wrote this script.  The movie is a character study; so there's not a lot of action.  While Cole does a good job with the pacing, the nature of the movie makes it a bit slow going.Chris Klein plays George Rifkin, a young lawyer whose wife is recovering from cancer.  He wants to remain close by her and seeks for ways to get out of the newly implemented draft.  Klein was in both ""American Pie"" films.  Here he gives a respectable performance as the young man torn between patriotism and his desire to remain home.  His wife is played by Ginnifer Goodwin who played Vivian, the first wife of Johnny Cash, in the film ""Walk the Line.""  Her wide-eyed performance is one of the best in the film.Elijah Wood from Cedar Rapids, Iowa plays Aaron Feller, a novelist who is estranged from his family and emotionally unstable.  Wood came before many screen audiences when he played the teenager who discovers a comet inDeep Impactand his classic role in three films based on ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Ally Sheedy who won best actress acclaim for ""High Art"" from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association & the National Society of Film Critics plays his therapist Dr. Reynolds who doesn't want to listen to Aaron any longer.Jon Bernthal plays James Dixon.  Of the three friends, he's the guy who supports the war with a short-trigger fuse.  His abbreviated fight scenes give the film short infusions of energy.  Bernthal played the interviewer in the filmThe Air I Breathe.  Elizabeth Moss who played the president's daughter on TV's ""West Wing"" and has been on TV's ""Mad Men"" plays Dixon's young girlfriend.  Her performance is also excellent as she learns that the guy she thought she had finally found is heading off to war.  After watching the film, I put it in the box for the next garage sale.

All three are due to report to duty in 30 days.  They get together to discuss their ""options"" about the situation.  One of them who is a taxi driver is convinced that it is their duty to serve without question.  Another one is a married attorney  and he is hesitant to go.  He even asks his well connected father to engage state politicians who can get him off the duty.  The third one is a city orphan of sorts.  His ""absent"" family is the indication of his highly dysfunctional internal life.  This young man is a writer who cannot work on his novel, who has no girlfriend (and is sexually dyfunctional), who is alianated from his immediate family (he has not talked to them for seven years).  His shrink does not even pay him attention during their sessions, let alone give him some constructive advice.  This poor guy is a master of loneliness and misdirection.  Film unfolds over the period of thirty days where we learn more about characters lives and their internal struggles.  By the end of the movie you will be blown away about each character's destiny coming to life, in the open, for all to see.  Interesting meditation on how generations of today are perceiving war, military and their own purpose of life and how all of that is different from all other wars we have known and sent young men to.Elijah Wood gives us a memorable performance in this film.
