You had to use your DVD player's options to determine the actual length (I didn't see it on the packaging).  The quality of the movie was fine.  Full-screen was expected since it was a made-for-TV movie.I had forgotten much of the story since I had not seen the movie in years but it was still AWESOME!  In some ways, it's even better than the original.  Different kids, different culture, but same basic solution - show the kids respect and insist on respect from them!  The depth of development of the kids was a bit better here than the original which is a bit surprising since the story itself was shorter.It was, in many ways, a typical Sidney Poitier movie - good drama without resorting to a lot of unnecessary violence.  Yes, there was some scuffling and even a gang fight and some shooting (no one was hit) but the impact was the drama and acting.It's a perfect extension of the original movie and the touch of the two ""kids"" from the original appearing at Mr. Thackery's retirement dinner was a very touching moment.

For me personally, ""To Sir With Love"", a story about ""telling tales and biting nails"" involving rowdy, misbehaved, and disrespectful students in a slum neighborhood in East End London, was more persuasive and more powerful than ""To Sir With Love II"" set in New York City. ""To Sir With Love"" has captured the very essence of humanity in the persona of Mr. Mark Thackeray and the ""East End"" students. The final school days scene, when the students honored their ""Sir"" with that powerful song (which was also the title) and showed him all their love and admiration for transforming all of them to responsible, mature, respectable and best of all LOVABLE and DECENT human beings, provided a very emotional moment not only for Mr. Thackeray and other members of the teaching staff.  This particular scene in the original movie moved me to tears. ""To Sir With Love II"" also dealt with this same subject matter, which gave me the chance to compare riotous and misbehaving students in London to those in New York City.  Although the students were transformed in the end, that transformation did not quite meet my expectations as did the original movie. And that comparison affected my decision as far as the rating is concerned. I did not like ""To Sir With Love"" ... As a matter of fact, I LOVE IT!!! I practically fell in love with Mr. Mark Thackeray ... and, of course, Sidney Poitier. And I LIKE ""To Sir With Love II"". In this day and age, teachers, professors, and all those involved in trying to educate immature and irresponsible students should emulate someone like the remarkable Mr. Mark Thackeray; In fact, all educational institutions should have a Mr. Thackeray in their faculty.
