477255,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,6305772649,A reader,"[6, 6]","Six different drummers played on the AJA recording.  Arguably the standout drum performance on a record filled with great performances, and certainly one of the most famous in all of rock music, is Steve Gadd's work on the title track.If you didn't know better, you'd come away from this documentary about the making of Aja with the impression that Bernard Purdie was the only drummer on the gig.  Numerous musicians who played on the record are interviewed, as well as people who had nothing whatsoever to do with it.  But nowhere is Steve Gadd's name or face mentioned or seen.  Others have noted this omission, but I feel the need to restate how curious it is.  Maybe Gadd wasn't available when the docu was being filmed.  But to actually perform the tune, with Purdie behind the drum kit, and never even mention Gadd's name?  Weird.  (No disrespect to Purdie intended.  He's a brilliant musician and a delightful personality, and his presence adds a lot to this video.)I assume the producers had to pare down their material to fit a 60-minute TV format.  Still, the video is largely unsatisfying.  Did we need a word-for-word recitation by Fagen of the lyrics to ""Black Cow,"" especially when there was no time to say Steve Gadd's name even once?  The live performances are interesting but lackluster, and don't include vocals.  ""Peg"" sounds like a rhythm track; why'd they bother?  ""Josie"" mopes along with a middling lead guitar by Becker, who can do better.But the video is worth seeing if you're interested in the Dan's creative process.  Fagen and Becker sit at the mixing board and banter about the tunes, breaking them down by tracks, so you can hear how they arrived at their final choices.  Singer Michael McDonald and engineer Roger Nichols muse candidly about the maddening perfectionism of Fagen and Becker, but then marvel at the outcome.  Larry Carlton describes his critical role as chart writer and arranger.  This is mixed in with biographical information, including a photo of Becker as a kid of maybe 12 years old, looking like Peter Pan with an electric guitar in his hands.One thing you won't get from this video -- but maybe it's the kind of thing that's impossible to capture -- is how Fagen and Becker actually write and produce.  The mystery of their partnership is intact. Nichols says it best when he likens them to one body with two brains (or did he say one brain with two bodies -- that would make more sense), finishing each other's sentences.  When they're together there's a lot of dead air after Fagen talks, during which Becker says nothing or smirks.  Must be ESP.  If the background and quirks of Steely Dan interest you, get this.  Or just watch parts of it on your favorite video clip website.

477270,APN6DO7VHDLTN,6305772649,Missing Person,"[29, 34]","I really don't get where some of the other reviews for this video/ DVD are coming from, saying that it's a good 'sleeping aid' or things of this nature.  A big part of what makes the ""Aja"" album such a landmark is the way it put to use such spellbinding musicianship from a long list of different players, and the sophisticated elegance and beauty of the songs themselves--this really IS fascinating stuff, even though many fans unfortunately don't seem to give a damn, and if that's the case, I don't know why they are bothering with this DVD in the first place.  Another reviewer commented that you've got to really LOVE Steely Dan to really enjoy this DVD--well you know what, people do love Steely Dan and for good reason--if you come to this DVD expecting mindless entertainment to watch while you throw back a few beers, you're out of your mind.  This DVD gives you a thrilling peek into the making of the album, demonstrating some of the musical techniques that were used--the way the bass was doubled on guitar on ""Josie"", and the layering of Michael McDonald's background vocals on ""Peg"" to point out a couple examples.  McDonald gives a highly intriguing, if ever-so-slightly derogatory discussion of his performance on ""Peg"", and you also get great interview/ performance segments from Chuck Rainey, Rick Marotta, Dean Parks, Denny Dias, and Bernard Purdie, as well as great segments from guitarist/ arranger Larry Carlton, producer Gary Katz, master engineer Roger Nichols, and of course, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker themselves.  Also, the appearance of the late Ian Dury is a shock (he died right around the time this DVD was released), although not an unpleasant one--it's quite strange since he wasn't at all involved in the making of the album, nor is he even someone you associate in the slightest with the West Coast pop-rock scene of the 1970s.  The interviews with Fagen and Becker and seeing them dissecting the tracks... GREAT stuff--priceless, really.  Fagen & Becker for once go easy on their supreme sarcasm and are shown in great spirit, great humor, and are even movingly reflective at times--wonderfully intimate stuff from a true genius team.  All that said, any TRUE Dan fan will indeed appreciate this DVD and LOVE having it in their collection.  On the other side of the coin, there are some drawbacks to the DVD for sure.  For one thing, it's rather scattershot--Becker mentions early in the DVD how the only other original Steely Dan member still working with them by the time of ""Aja"" was guitarist Denny Dias, and then, over halfway through the DVD, they get back on the topic of Dias, discussing how they hooked up with him which ultimately lead to the beginning of Steely Dan.  They do basically move from one song to the next, but the sequencing could have been a lot better.  However, this would have been a virtually ignorable issue had this DVD been more thorough.  Quite frankly, this DVD left me hungry for more--it's painfully far off from being fully comprehensive.  As other reviewers have already stated, the fact that drummer Steve Gadd's name isn't even mentioned in the DVD is a damn shame indeed, and that's just for starters.  I wish there was even more interview stuff with McDonald, Nichols, Dias, etc...  So, in the end, the DVD does leave me a little unsatisfied, but I'm still thrilled with the great stuff that it does offer, and I think any serious Steely Dan fan ought to feel the same.",4,scattershot and kind of lacking but PRETTY DARN GREAT anyway,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,3450,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'where', 'other', 'reviews', 'video/', 'DVD', 'are', 'coming', 'saying', 'good', ""'sleeping"", 'aid', 'things', 'nature', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'Aja', 'album', 'landmark', 'way', 'put', 'use', 'such', 'spellbinding', 'musicianship', 'long', 'list', 'different', 'players', 'sophisticated', 'elegance', 'beauty', 'songs', 'really', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'even', 'many', 'fans', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'give', 'damn', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'bothering', 'DVD', 'first', 'place', 'reviewer', 'commented', ""'ve"", 'got', 'really', 'LOVE', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'love', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'good', 'reason', 'come', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'watch', 'throw', 'back', 'few', 'beers', ""'re"", 'mind', 'DVD', 'thrilling', 'peek', 'making', 'album', 'demonstrating', 'musical', 'techniques', 'were', 'used', 'way', 'bass', 'was', 'doubled', 'guitar', 'Josie', 'layering', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'background', 'vocals', 'Peg', 'point', 'out', 'couple', 'examples', 'McDonald', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'ever-so-slightly', 'derogatory', 'discussion', 'performance', 'Peg', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'interview/', 'performance', 'segments', 'Chuck', 'Rainey', 'Rick', 'Marotta', 'Dean', 'Parks', 'Denny', 'Dias', 'Bernard', 'Purdie', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'segments', 'guitarist/', 'arranger', 'Larry', 'Carlton', 'producer', 'Gary', 'Katz', 'master', 'engineer', 'Roger', 'Nichols', 'course', 'Donald', 'Fagen', 'Walter', 'Becker', 'Also', 'appearance', 'late', 'Ian', 'Dury', 'shock', 'died', 'right', 'time', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'one', 'quite', 'strange', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'making', 'album', 'even', 'someone', 'associate', 'slightest', 'West', 'Coast', 'pop-rock', 'scene', '1970s', 'interviews', 'Fagen', 'Becker', 'seeing', 'dissecting', 'tracks', 'GREAT', 'stuff', 'priceless', 'really', 'Fagen', 'Becker', 'once', 'go', 'easy', 'supreme', 'sarcasm', 'are', 'shown', 'great', 'spirit', 'great', 'humor', 'are', 'even', 'movingly', 'reflective', 'times', 'wonderfully', 'intimate', 'stuff', 'true', 'genius', 'team', 'said', 'TRUE', 'Dan', 'fan', 'will', 'indeed', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'LOVE', 'having', 'collection', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'DVD', 'sure', 'one', 'thing', 'rather', 'scattershot', 'Becker', 'mentions', 'early', 'DVD', 'how', 'only', 'other', 'original', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'member', 'still', 'working', 'time', 'Aja', 'was', 'guitarist', 'Denny', 'Dias', 'then', 'halfway', 'DVD', 'get', 'back', 'topic', 'Dias', 'discussing', 'how', 'hooked', 'up', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'beginning', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'do', 'basically', 'move', 'one', 'song', 'next', 'sequencing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'virtually', 'ignorable', 'issue', 'had', 'DVD', 'been', 'more', 'thorough', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'DVD', 'left', 'hungry', 'more', 'painfully', 'far', 'being', 'fully', 'comprehensive', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'fact', 'drummer', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'name', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'damn', 'shame', 'indeed', 'just', 'starters', 'wish', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'interview', 'stuff', 'McDonald', 'Nichols', 'Dias', 'etc', 'So', 'end', 'DVD', 'leave', 'little', 'unsatisfied', ""'m"", 'still', 'thrilled', 'great', 'stuff', 'offer', 'think', 'serious', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'fan', 'ought', 'feel', 'same']",N/A

I am a big fan of the band. I was still disappointed. The saving grace in my case was that I discovered that it came in a 3-pack version for about the same price as the single item, so I didn't pay so much (although the other two in that pack, on U2's Joshua Tree and Phil Collins' Face Value, were no better, really).First off, lousy camera work/film quality on much of it. Looks like I filmed it. Secondly, if it's such a classic album, then I think it would have been worthwhile to cover all the songs on it, especially since there were only 7! ""I Got the News"" is relegated to credits playover at the end. Evidently it wasn't so classic. Third, if you're going to cover a band and show how they play -- and one good thing in this case is that a version of the whole band does do a couple of tunes together for the video -- for Pete's sake get the audio set up properly! Becker's soloing in at least one of the 2-3 tunes shown this way can hardly be heard, and not because anybody's talking over it or something else is being presented. It would also have made more sense to follow the sequencing of the original album, to give the film some added coherence (especially given the disparate styles/songs the album contains).I might have given this 3 stars, being a little generous, but it particularly pales by comparison to at least one other title in this series, on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. I am a bigger fan of the Dan than I am of the Floyd, but that effort was more professional all around, did cover every track of the album in question, did respect the original sequencing, and moreover, provided about 40 minutes of interesting bonus material, whereas this one provides none.In short, although it's nice to see the boys talking about their work, and you can definitely glean the kind of rapport they have with each other musically and personally in their subtly ironic conversations at the mixing board, and you get to hear a bit about the tunes and see them perform a bit (remarkable how much Fagen looks like Freddie Mercury when shot in profile while singing!), they and this album deserved much better treatment.
