I enjoyed both seasons of this post apocalyptic event series for a variety of reasons.  Not so much special sci-fi effects, extreme action, or ripped heros, but rather what I affectionately call &#34;morality tales&#34; in a setting that allows for re-freshed nuance and re-visited angles of perspective make this one appealing to me.  I never read the comic book, but kudos for it's author and to the screen-writers who interpreted.  The BC, Canada setting is often breathtaking, and I'm a sucker for green on the screen.

If you're looking at or getting season 2, you already like the show.  Here is what the MGM produced on demand edition is:  8 dvds in 2 dvd cases, no box or anything.  No extras, no cover art.  Just the shows.  They were apparently originally produced in widescreen, but these dvds do not have widescreen, they have fullscreen crops.  This is on one hand very annoying, because I hate crops, I like to see the full art of whatever it is that was filmed.  On the other hand, presumably because there are no extras, this edition is $30 (at least at the present time).  Some full seasons cost a lot higher than this.  Having any kind of Jeremiah not only available but in my price range to me outweighs the annoyance of the picture cropping.  So I'm ranking it 5 stars for the content of the show.Some nice surprises from season 2 include the presence of Sam Gamgee as Mister Smith & the Chief from Battlestar Galactica as the guy in charge of Milhaven.  Also a character with the pleasant name of Liberty.  (Verity Lambert produced the first season of Doctor Who, & I've liked virtue names ever since, or at least ever since I saw the credits.)

Then I recognized the thief he met and later partner, Curdy - he was Theo from The Cosby Show, but bigger, stronger and much much tougher, not to mention a lot of cool dreds.The world they walked had both the despair of the breakdown of all order, and an equal measure of hope and faith that goodness would rise and eventually prevail over the savagery that many assumed would be our prelude to the end of the world.  And from that tenuous beginning, a new world order of sanity and cooperation began to grow, episode by episode.  So I fell in love with this show, which blended action and confidence in every episode and left you wanting to see what came next.The first season were basically stand alone dramas.  Having linked up with the only local tech source, Thunder Mountain, our heroes went forth and had their adventures while we learned about their world and saw how pockets of humanity were lifting themselves by their very boot-straps.Season two - the story continues.  But the world is a bit more civilized, now that with Thunder Mt help communities are restoring power and water and sane government again.  So the showrunners introduce that over-arc themes to carry us through the season: Valhalla Sector and its legacy, the new messiah led world order that seems like a rise of civilization but has flavors of tyranny in its workings, the rapidly expanding dominance of 'Daniel.'Introduce Mister Smith, a man who channels the words of God, and Libby, the love interest of Jeremiah from the Valhalla Sector who, alas, is not completely what she seems.  We race down to the great confrontation, and the hopes of every free community hang on the outcome.A wonderful tale worth telling, beautifully produced and realized, with haunting music and tight stars.  You will enjoy each varied and mind-expanding episode.  Worth a look.P.S. - much is said about no frills production values.  I found no deterrent from anything I saw on the screen.  It's all about the story - who cares if the widescreen percentage is X instead of Y?  It worked for me.  I'm all about the story - and the story is solid.",5,"a kinder, gentler apocolypse",1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2311,"['loved', 'Jeremiah', 'season', 'one', 'saw', 'syndication', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Showtime', 'initial', '34', 'hell', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'boy', '90210', '34', 'got', 'sucked', 'first', 'viewing', 'Then', 'recognized', 'thief', 'met', 'later', 'partner', 'Curdy', 'was', 'Theo', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'much', 'much', 'tougher', 'not', 'mention', 'lot', 'cool', 'dreds.The', 'world', 'walked', 'had', 'despair', 'breakdown', 'order', 'equal', 'measure', 'hope', 'faith', 'goodness', 'would', 'rise', 'eventually', 'prevail', 'savagery', 'many', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'prelude', 'end', 'world', 'tenuous', 'beginning', 'new', 'world', 'order', 'sanity', 'cooperation', 'began', 'grow', 'episode', 'episode', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'blended', 'action', 'confidence', 'episode', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'came', 'next.The', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'basically', 'stand', 'alone', 'dramas', 'Having', 'linked', 'up', 'only', 'local', 'tech', 'source', 'Thunder', 'Mountain', 'heroes', 'went', 'forth', 'had', 'adventures', 'learned', 'world', 'saw', 'how', 'pockets', 'humanity', 'were', 'lifting', 'very', 'boot-straps.Season', 'two', 'story', 'world', 'bit', 'more', 'civilized', 'now', 'Thunder', 'Mt', 'help', 'communities', 'are', 'restoring', 'power', 'water', 'sane', 'government', 'again', 'showrunners', 'introduce', 'over-arc', 'themes', 'carry', 'season', 'Valhalla', 'Sector', 'legacy', 'new', 'messiah', 'led', 'world', 'order', 'rise', 'civilization', 'flavors', 'tyranny', 'workings', 'rapidly', 'expanding', 'dominance', ""'Daniel"", 'Mister', 'Smith', 'man', 'who', 'words', 'God', 'Libby', 'love', 'interest', 'Jeremiah', 'Valhalla', 'Sector', 'who', 'alas', 'not', 'completely', 'what', 'race', 'down', 'great', 'confrontation', 'hopes', 'free', 'community', 'hang', 'outcome.A', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'worth', 'telling', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'realized', 'haunting', 'music', 'tight', 'stars', 'will', 'enjoy', 'varied', 'mind-expanding', 'episode', 'look.P.S', 'much', 'said', 'frills', 'production', 'values', 'found', 'deterrent', 'anything', 'saw', 'screen', 'story', 'who', 'widescreen', 'percentage', 'X', 'instead', 'Y', 'worked', ""'m"", 'story', 'story', 'solid']",N/A

I know this because I recorded every episode onto VHS at the time and later burned my own DVDs from those old VHS tapes. And I went back and double checked... full-frame. Now if there are widescreen prints available, perhaps they will be used when/if the suits decide to reassess this GREAT SERIES and decide to produce them onto proper, hopefully Blu-Ray discs in the future, and I am all for that and I would purchase them again if that happens.

That leaves a world filled with children left to mind an age filled with terrible things. sometimes that means Daisy Cutters falling into the hands of madmen and other thimes that means hatreds passed on to those who were too young to really understand the posion they consumed. all the while you watch two people as they get to know one another and they try to change the world, slowly finding people like them and slowly finding out that there are both pros and cons to the things happening both inside and outside places with the power to change the world.In the second season, this series comes to a sad halt all-too-soon. Perhaps it was because of a lack of viewership or perhaps it was because not enough money was spend promoting the product. Whatever the case, the show was one of those things that had the concepts and the notions that could have continued on. I personally thought the ideas that were established in Luke Perry's acting had become great, with the letter writing to his father and the idealism really working. m.J. Warner was great in this, too, working as someone that a person could both try to understand and also see keeping the world at arm's length because of the past. combine that with Thunfder mountain and the struggle that was coming and you had some really good stuff. A man who took direction from his God and people who needed direction because of the terrible things science inflicted; the duality in the series really wasn't lost on anyone that put time into watching this develop.As far as things go, there are always filler episodes involved in something. Still, these filler pieces were utilized to build up bigger and better things a lot of the time, making certain that stories went off in future episodes. From the words that Jeremiah was obsessed with in the beginning to the words that got them into Thunder mountain and involved in a finale that came too son but worked out, i thought the series played itself out well.

The Sci-Fi channel demonstrated once again that every now and then they can get something right and do a nice enough job with the writing and directing that we are willing to forgive the odd hole in the plot or thin excuse to introduce a new character.So when I received season 2 I was looking forward to it.  Beginning with the botched title sequence (and an annoying, sappy song that sounds like something I should have heard in the waiting room at my dentist's office) and then with the introduction of a new Enemy from the East,  Sci-Fi now demonstrates what it does more often: it ruins an otherwise promising show. The characterizations have become shallow and tedious, the plot unforgivably predictable and formulaic.  Jeremiah's ritual letters to his father have been replaced by a session of self-absorbed whining in every episode that one expects from 90210 rather than a show about a post-apocalyptic America.  (I'm ready to start working for Daniel's side every time I have to listen to it.)  The only bright spot in the entire season is the introduction of Mr. Smith, a character who hears God and intervenes on behalf of our bedraggled heroes.  Were it not for Mr. Smith I might have hung up on the season from square one.
