Little bits are thrown in for comedic value and they center around Adam's roomates in college who are all disgusting (I would reccommend not eating while watching these parts, it could ruin your meal).  Overall, everyone will see Eve as a total beyotch because she is being totally unfair in the relationship while Adam is a totaly douche. I would not reccommend this movie for it's comedic value, but maybe as an afterschool special?

See, for example, National Lampoon's Dorm Daze...no, actually, don't.  But this movie was pretty damn good.  First off, Emanuelle Chirqui is my new ""it"" girl.  She is so beautiful, I'm in love.  Looking at her beautiful face and body is itself worth the couple bucks to rent this movie.  But there's more!  The story is interesting and there are lots of funny lines and situations.  To put it in perspective, I'd say this movie is not quite as good as American Pie, but it is better than Van Wilder and Dude, Where's My Car? among others.  Rent it!  You will not be disappointed.",4,"FINALLY, A GOOD NATIONAL LAMPOON MOVIE!!!!",1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,665,"['output', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'been', 'unmitigated', 'crap', 'See', 'example', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Dorm', 'Daze', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'First', 'Emanuelle', 'Chirqui', 'new', 'girl', 'so', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'love', 'Looking', 'beautiful', 'face', 'body', 'couple', 'bucks', 'rent', 'movie', 'more', 'story', 'interesting', 'are', 'lots', 'funny', 'lines', 'situations', 'put', 'perspective', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'American', 'Pie', 'better', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'others', 'Rent', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",National Lampoon's Adam and Eve
956628,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000CCD1QQ,Chris Kennison,"[7, 9]","On one hand, I give the movie credit where other movies have been unrealistic and phony, ADAM & EVE had the guts to make something very real. At times, TOO REAL. At times, unnecessarily TOO REAL.They just had to slip in the gross out jokes to please all the immature goofballs out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a time and a place for gross out jokes, pubes in the shower etc., but they're less funny then something that takes execution and timing. Not to mention, they alienate the audience. The people that find that thing disgusting, are put off, and won't return.Okay... back to the movie. ADAM & EVE is about love and sex. It's about a young HOT college girl, EVE (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and a typical college guy, ADAM (Cameron Douglas). They meet, find each other interesting, Adam tries to score and then Eve tells him that she's a virgin, and is being patient with her standing.Then, as I said before, the movie is very real. All the things that come into play: the ridiculing friends, the things you do when your girlfriend looks like Emmanuelle Chriqui and you're being made to wait, the criticisms, the other girl that ISN'T holding out, etc. etc.Although, I question one thing. Why in the world would a girl looking like Emmanuelle Chriqui be interested in this guy? She seemed like a nice girl. Smart. Nice room. Nice, wholesome girl. Yet, Adam is a partying bum. Lazy. Lives in a pig-sty. His yard looks like a trash dump and he goes and lays in his bed all day. His friends are the epitome of bums and womanizers... but then... I thought about it, and realized... actually, when I was in college, yeah... that was about right. Women liked these type guys.Although, I do give the movie credit for being real, there wasn't enough going on. There weren't enough side plots and not enough to keep the movies pace going. When the movie deviated from the MAIN plot, it just went and told gross out stories with Adam's loser friends, or showed little side stories that never really explained themselves.Ultimately, the only good thing I can say about ADAM & EVE is that it was realistic. Otherwise, the movie was less than average, and pretty forgettable.",2,Riding the fence on this one,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,2175,"['one', 'hand', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'where', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'unrealistic', 'phony', 'ADAM', 'EVE', 'had', 'guts', 'make', 'something', 'very', 'real', 'times', 'TOO', 'REAL', 'times', 'unnecessarily', 'TOO', 'REAL.They', 'just', 'had', 'slip', 'gross', 'out', 'jokes', 'please', 'immature', 'out', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'place', 'gross', 'jokes', 'pubes', 'shower', 'etc.', ""'re"", 'less', 'funny', 'then', 'something', 'execution', 'timing', 'Not', 'mention', 'alienate', 'audience', 'people', 'find', 'thing', 'disgusting', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'wo', ""n't"", 'return.Okay', 'back', 'movie', 'ADAM', 'EVE', 'love', 'sex', 'young', 'HOT', 'college', 'girl', 'EVE', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'typical', 'college', 'guy', 'ADAM', 'Cameron', 'Douglas', 'meet', 'find', 'other', 'interesting', 'Adam', 'score', 'then', 'Eve', 'virgin', 'being', 'patient', 'standing.Then', 'said', 'movie', 'very', 'real', 'things', 'come', 'play', 'ridiculing', 'friends', 'things', 'do', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', ""'re"", 'being', 'made', 'wait', 'criticisms', 'other', 'girl', ""N'T"", 'holding', 'out', 'etc', 'question', 'one', 'thing', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'girl', 'looking', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'be', 'interested', 'guy', 'seemed', 'nice', 'girl', 'Smart', 'Nice', 'room', 'Nice', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'Adam', 'partying', 'bum', 'Lazy', 'pig-sty', 'yard', 'looks', 'trash', 'dump', 'bed', 'day', 'friends', 'are', 'epitome', 'bums', 'womanizers', 'then', 'thought', 'realized', 'actually', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'yeah', 'was', 'about', 'right', 'Women', 'liked', 'type', 'guys.Although', 'do', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'being', 'real', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'going', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'side', 'plots', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'movies', 'pace', 'going', 'When', 'movie', 'deviated', 'MAIN', 'plot', 'just', 'went', 'told', 'gross', 'stories', 'Adam', 'loser', 'friends', 'showed', 'little', 'side', 'stories', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'themselves.Ultimately', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'ADAM', 'EVE', 'was', 'realistic', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'average', 'pretty', 'forgettable']",National Lampoon's Adam and Eve

A few may watch it to see how to keep their virginity until they marry, or perhaps die. Some like me will stumble upon it on late night cable, and find it a nearly perfect cure for insomnia. How could I know any one film could be so bad? In a spirit of genuine concern, I formally warn you.No plot, no acting, no skin, no comedy, no action.

956630,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000CCD1QQ,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[10, 13]","NATIONAL LAMPOON has come out with some great party movies.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The premise is pretty straightforward:  a girl in college does not want to go ""all the way"" with her b/f because she wants everything to be special.  That's fair enough and is also understandable.IF the movie would have only focused on that and nothing else (and I can live with it being over an hour shorter), then it would have been OK.  The reason?  Easy.  Emmanuelle Chriqui is absolutely STUNNING as Eve.  Her beauty fills of the screen;  I'd love to see more of her work and hope that she gets better roles in much better movies than this farce.Unfortunately, too much of the movie is about the subplot of living @ a fraternity house.  To be sure, this is a very common motif in NATIONAL LAMPOON movies.  The problem is, the fellow frat-boys of Adam are beyond disgusting.  Moreover, the movie wants to ""push the envelope"" of being nasty, relying on shock-value more than doing something because it has any humor value.Cameron Douglas is a goon;  I was a bit surprised to learn that he was the son of Michael Douglas.  He certainly does not have any acting ability whatsoever, unlike his father & grandfather.  Apparently in this film he is a sort of Ron Jeremy anti-hero type;  the dufus guy who ends up with the sizzling hot babe.This is the bottom line, and I will be as fair as I can be:  if you crave bathroom humor and simply can't get enough of it, then by all means buy this DVD.  If bathroom humor is your ""thing,"" then this DVD is a dream-come-true.However, if like me a little bit of that stuff goes a LONG way, then check out other, better NATIONAL LAMPOON movies such as BARELY LEGAL and VAN WILDER.
