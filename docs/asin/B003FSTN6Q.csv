It took a little while for me to catch on, and understand the whole ""shinies"" and ""shadows"" thing, but that was either the producers point, or because it had been so long since I watched season 4 that I forgot some details.I was glad that I was finally able to see Jaime Kennedy as Eli, and not see him as Jaime Kennedy anymore, I think that his performance improved a lot, I was able to take his character a lot more seriously.  I also enjoyed that Delia was a lot more accepting of the goings-on, but still managed to maintain her hesitation about the involvement of her and her family.The boy who played Melinda's son did a great job, he portrayed such innocence and and acceptance of the ghosts and other beings he saw, I almost could believe they are a part of his real life also.I was disappointed that the series ended, but glad that it ended on such a bright note, with Aiden and the shinies winning against the shadows.",5,Great show,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1032,"['have', 'loved', 'show', 'beginning', 'season', 'stood', 'up', 'previous', 'standard', 'set', 'imo', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'catch', 'understand', 'whole', 'shinies', 'shadows', 'thing', 'was', 'producers', 'point', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'watched', 'season', '4', 'forgot', 'details.I', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'see', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'Eli', 'not', 'see', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'anymore', 'think', 'performance', 'improved', 'lot', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'seriously', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Delia', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'accepting', 'goings-on', 'still', 'managed', 'maintain', 'hesitation', 'involvement', 'family.The', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Melinda', 'son', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portrayed', 'such', 'innocence', 'acceptance', 'ghosts', 'other', 'beings', 'saw', 'almost', 'could', 'believe', 'are', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'also.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'series', 'ended', 'ended', 'such', 'bright', 'note', 'Aiden', 'shinies', 'winning', 'shadows']",N/A

The Lead Actress Hewitt, I do have issues with.  She can act.  I will give her this credit.  She has issues with dress and character situations.  This whole series is based on a young, ""gifted"" woman with paranormal abilities.  Her platform for the series is a small town, simple life of a paranormal person yet her dress reflects bizarre personality which minimizes the premise of the series.  The personality of the actress is NOT in symmetry with the plot of the series.  Not to mention this series is NOT intented for young viewers however they will see them from time to time and quite frankly Hewitt's dress d/o can be unwise for children to be viewing.
