851855,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0002YLCUQ,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[3, 4]","Is it possible for a 30-something single gay man to find true love (not just sex) in West Hollywood?  That's the question in ""10 Attitudes"" (2001), an ambitious but very low budget (and often looks/sounds like it) from first-time director Michael Gallant, who also co-wrote it with its star, openly gay comedian/actor Jason Stuart.Jason plays Josh, a 30-something nebbish Jewish caterer who discovers his boyfriend of ten years has been cheating on him, and who dreads the idea of having to resume dating at his age, in a city that is more attuned to younger, buff men looking just for ""hook ups."" He considers moving back home to Cleveland, but his younger best friend Brandon (played with wit and charm by newcomer Christopher Cowan) gets him to agree to a bet:  Brandon will fix him up with ten dates and, if he doesn't find true love by the last one, he is free to give up on Southern CA and move back to Ohio.  First step is a makeover, including a campy romp at a clothing store managed by Tex (Jm J Bullock), then an attempt at meeting people from an online site (great for hooking up for sex, but not to find someone to love), and participation in a strange support group run by Glenda (Judy Tenuta).  There are also flashbacks to Josh getting bullied in high school, and time spent with his sister and her intolerant husband.As you would expect, the dates are largely disasters, ranging from psychos to boy-band fanatics, lots of guys willing to ""hook up"" but few that would likely even be capable of love.  The dates do include entertaining cameos from David Faustino (""Married With Children"") and Sean Kanan (""The Bold and the Beautiful""), and a connection with a young hustler whom he originally met in the support group.  The viewer can't help but root for Josh when he finally meets someone who appears to be ""the one"", and cry along whenever he gets let down.  The overall moral is that finding ""Mr. Right"" is tough, but you have to keep at it, and trust that he will find you when the time is right.It's a shame, with a diverse and talented cast such as it has, that the director could not have financed a bigger budget.  Some of the scenes shot in public places are poorly lighted, or the sound is poor (Ironically, one scene in the outtakes has perfect sound, while the same scene they actually used, which is a pivotal one toward the end of the film, can barely be understood.)  I also didn't need to listed to the director commentary to realize that much of the dialogue is adlibbed by the actors (The surprise was that some of it was actually scripted!), perhaps not that risky when dealing with a primary actor who has a background in improv comedy, but the subject matter and its viewers would have been much better served if the production was more structured.  I do give it extra credit for some interesting bonus features on the DVD, including a clever inclusion of all of the ""eye candy"" from the film.  Won audience awards at a couple of gay film festivals, and generally reviewed positively by critics, but this won't be everyone's cup of campy tea.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.",4,"Sweet low-budget romantic comedy, could have been better",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,3107,"['possible', '30-something', 'single', 'gay', 'man', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'sex', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'question', '10', 'Attitudes', '2001', 'ambitious', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'often', 'first-time', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gallant', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'star', 'openly', 'gay', 'comedian/actor', 'Jason', 'Stuart.Jason', 'Josh', '30-something', 'nebbish', 'Jewish', 'caterer', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'ten', 'years', 'been', 'cheating', 'who', 'dreads', 'idea', 'having', 'resume', 'dating', 'age', 'city', 'more', 'attuned', 'younger', 'buff', 'men', 'looking', 'just', 'hook', 'ups', 'moving', 'back', 'home', 'Cleveland', 'younger', 'best', 'friend', 'Brandon', 'played', 'wit', 'charm', 'newcomer', 'Christopher', 'Cowan', 'agree', 'bet', 'Brandon', 'will', 'fix', 'up', 'ten', 'dates', ""n't"", 'find', 'true', 'love', 'last', 'one', 'free', 'give', 'up', 'Southern', 'CA', 'move', 'back', 'Ohio', 'First', 'step', 'makeover', 'including', 'campy', 'romp', 'clothing', 'store', 'managed', 'Tex', 'Jm', 'J', 'Bullock', 'then', 'attempt', 'meeting', 'people', 'online', 'site', 'great', 'hooking', 'up', 'sex', 'not', 'find', 'someone', 'love', 'participation', 'strange', 'support', 'group', 'run', 'Glenda', 'Judy', 'Tenuta', 'are', 'also', 'flashbacks', 'Josh', 'getting', 'bullied', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'spent', 'sister', 'intolerant', 'husband.As', 'would', 'expect', 'dates', 'are', 'largely', 'disasters', 'ranging', 'psychos', 'boy-band', 'fanatics', 'lots', 'guys', 'willing', 'hook', 'up', 'few', 'would', 'likely', 'even', 'be', 'capable', 'love', 'dates', 'do', 'include', 'entertaining', 'cameos', 'David', 'Faustino', 'Married', 'Children', 'Sean', 'Kanan', 'Bold', 'Beautiful', 'connection', 'young', 'hustler', 'whom', 'originally', 'met', 'support', 'group', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Josh', 'when', 'finally', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'cry', 'along', 'whenever', 'let', 'down', 'overall', 'moral', 'finding', 'Mr', 'Right', 'tough', 'have', 'keep', 'trust', 'will', 'find', 'when', 'time', 'right.It', 'shame', 'diverse', 'talented', 'cast', 'such', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'financed', 'bigger', 'budget', 'scenes', 'shot', 'public', 'places', 'are', 'poorly', 'lighted', 'sound', 'poor', 'Ironically', 'one', 'scene', 'outtakes', 'perfect', 'sound', 'same', 'scene', 'actually', 'used', 'pivotal', 'one', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'understood', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'listed', 'director', 'commentary', 'realize', 'much', 'dialogue', 'adlibbed', 'actors', 'surprise', 'was', 'was', 'actually', 'scripted', 'perhaps', 'not', 'risky', 'when', 'dealing', 'primary', 'actor', 'who', 'background', 'improv', 'comedy', 'subject', 'matter', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'production', 'was', 'more', 'structured', 'do', 'give', 'extra', 'credit', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'including', 'clever', 'inclusion', 'eye', 'candy', 'film', 'Won', 'audience', 'awards', 'couple', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'generally', 'reviewed', 'positively', 'critics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'campy', 'tea', 'give', '4', '5', 'stars']",10 Attitudes

Josh then agrees to have his bestfriend Brandon (Christopher Cowen) find the man of his dreams in 10 dates or less or Josh will move back to Ohio.The script has possibilites for some serious comedy and the talented cast expands to include David Fasutino and Alexandra Paul, however what develops is a painful (and I do mean painful) attempt of comedy with ten different skits. The people that Josh agrees to go out with is pitiful to say the least. The movie crams in every gay cliche and stereotype imaginable from drug users, alcoholic drunks, and emotional cripples to sex maniacs and the mentally unstable. The use of 10 dates losses it charm quickly and becomes tiring with the same drama unfolding (cheaters, liars, drug abusers, lunatics) and it becomes so predictable and boring you resist the urge to fast forward through the dates to save yourself from falling asleep.The only bright spots was the charming Christopher Cowen, who along with David Faustino and Alexandra Paul resist the need to over act their parts, yet cannot compensate for a movie were the director has lost all control and what emerges from 10 attitudes is simple madness and mayhem.",1,Really one attitude,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,1375,"['movie', '10', 'attitudes', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Gallant', 'story', '10', 'year', 'relationship', 'end', 'when', 'Josh', 'Jason', 'Stuart', 'boyfriend', 'engaged', 'having', 'affair', 'kid', 'age', 'Josh', 'then', 'have', 'bestfriend', 'Brandon', 'Christopher', 'Cowen', 'find', 'man', 'dreams', '10', 'dates', 'less', 'Josh', 'will', 'move', 'back', 'Ohio.The', 'script', 'possibilites', 'serious', 'comedy', 'talented', 'cast', 'include', 'David', 'Fasutino', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'however', 'what', 'painful', 'do', 'mean', 'painful', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'ten', 'different', 'skits', 'people', 'Josh', 'go', 'out', 'pitiful', 'say', 'least', 'movie', 'crams', 'gay', 'cliche', 'stereotype', 'imaginable', 'drug', 'users', 'alcoholic', 'drunks', 'emotional', 'cripples', 'sex', 'maniacs', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'use', '10', 'dates', 'losses', 'charm', 'quickly', 'tiring', 'same', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'cheaters', 'liars', 'drug', 'abusers', 'lunatics', 'so', 'predictable', 'boring', 'resist', 'urge', 'fast', 'forward', 'dates', 'save', 'falling', 'asleep.The', 'only', 'bright', 'spots', 'was', 'charming', 'Christopher', 'Cowen', 'who', 'David', 'Faustino', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'resist', 'need', 'over', 'act', 'parts', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'movie', 'were', 'director', 'lost', 'control', 'what', '10', 'attitudes', 'simple', 'madness', 'mayhem']",10 Attitudes
851857,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002YLCUQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","10 ATTITUDES is a low budget, first film by director Michael Gallant that examines the highs and lows of contemporary dating that feels so spontaneous that it seems more like overhearing conversations in a cafe rather than a scripted movie.  And for this tale of frustrated companion shopping, the minor details of awkward editing, obvious hand held camera use, and making the best of available lighting in real locations just doesn't matter.What does matter is the pacing and the funny (and not so funny) lines of each of the characters in this ensemble piece.  Josh (Jason Stuart) is a thirties-something gay caterer in a  long-term relationship with a lothario who embarrassingly discovers his partner's lifestyle en flagrant.  Devastated and disillusioned, Josh wants to leave West Hollywood and return to Cleveland, but his closest friend Brandon (Christopher Cowan - a very fine, young, natural actor) supports him by promising to arrange ten dates within a weeks' time, a cadre among whom Brandon bets Jason will find a new love and remain in West Hollywood.  If no new love is found, Jason will return home to lick his wounds.Josh gets the clothes makeover from Tex (JM J Bulock) and some tips on dating from various friends and therapist types (Judy Tenuta, Alexandra Paul, Lydia Nicole and more) and begins his arranged dating with 10 of some of the most diverse types everyone who has played the dating game has encountered (and incidentally there is a lot of fine eye candy here!). None of the 10 ""attitudes"" (for that is what these men represent) works out and Jason is about to depart for Cleveland (Brandon obviously lost his bet) when things change. And that change is well written and worth the surprise wait.What this film lacks in technical skill it makes up for in spirit, and if you are able to dispense with the production means and concentration the acting and the message of ""10 ATTITUDES"", you are in for a treat.  This is a fine social comment about a problem that afflicts not only this gay population of the film, but relationships across the board.

The premise of the movie is paper-thin and has been done numerous times in other films (albeit usually straight movies).  The acting is also awkward; Gallant discusses in a behind-the-scenes doc that the actors mostly improvised - it shows.  You know a movie is in trouble when David Faustino gives the most accomplished performance!The tone of the movie is also highly erratic, veering from broad comedy (courtesy of JM J. Bullock) to maudlin drama (a flashback to Josh's childhood).  In the end, it's just a big waste of time.  I have to admit that I only watched this movie because a distant relative who I haven't seen in many years has a small part in it (he plays one of the Attitudes - which one shall remain a mystery).
