1452285,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B005ALILEG,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 3]","For years, I have wanted Disney to start releasing on DVD the shows and movies that I remember seeing and growing up on in the 80s when ""The Disney Sunday Movie"", or whichever title it was going by, was on TV. I was extremely excited when I discovered that Disney had indeed opened the vault and were releasing wonderful titles on the 'Disney Generation Collection' line. How great! Maybe we will finally get more of the shows/movies/specials we have been waiting for.""Fuzzbucket"" is a charming and whimsical tale that, even though we have seen it's kind before and probably will know exactly who it goes, doesn't fail to be charming, watchable, and takes you back to a more fun and innocent time. 12 year old Michael Gerber is starting middle school. Everyone thinks that his invisible friend, Fuzzbucket, is just Michael acting out over starting MS. How wrong they are. Fuzzbucket is real. Once he becomes visible, we see that he sort of looks like a mixture of Alf and a rat. Fuzzbucket had turned invisible because he was away from his home after midnight, which gives it a sort of ""Gremlins"" like take with it's after midnight rule. Fuzzbucket must return back home before midnight, or this time, the invisibility will be permanent.Written and directed by the great Mick Garris, and produced by John Landis, ""Fuzzbucket"" is a simple tale in a time when that was enough. The simple pleasures of this show, as well as the others shown on Disney, are refreshing and most welcoming in an age where everything has to be high concept, high maintenance, and battling each other out to be the hippest and edgiest. There are also some familiar faces here - Joe Regalbuto(Murphy Brown), John Vernon (Animal House, Dirty Harry), as well as actresses you remember seeing growing up like Fran Ryan and Robyn Lively. One of my favorite parts of this DVD is how it also includes the original ""Disney Sunday Movie"" opening and Michael Eisner's intro the show, alongside Mickey Mouse himself. I am so glad that was included. It brought back a lot of memories.There really isn't much else to say. ""Fuzzbucket"" is cute and charming, and will surely bring back a wave of nostalgia of a time when something like this was shown regularly on network television. Now, if this 'Disney Generation Collection' continues, maybe we can finally get Mr.Boogedy/Bride Of Boogedy, Brand New Life with Barbara Eden, Not Quite Normal with Alan Thicke, and so many others, out on DVD. Thanks, Disney. It means a lot that you have started to do this.",4,Finally Opening The Vault!,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,2518,"['years', 'have', 'wanted', 'Disney', 'start', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'shows', 'movies', 'remember', 'seeing', 'growing', 'up', '80s', 'when', 'Disney', 'Sunday', 'Movie', 'whichever', 'title', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'TV', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'when', 'discovered', 'Disney', 'had', 'indeed', 'opened', 'vault', 'were', 'releasing', 'wonderful', 'titles', ""'Disney"", 'Generation', 'Collection', 'line', 'How', 'great', 'Maybe', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'more', 'shows/movies/specials', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Fuzzbucket', 'charming', 'whimsical', 'tale', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'kind', 'probably', 'will', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', ""n't"", 'fail', 'be', 'charming', 'watchable', 'back', 'more', 'fun', 'innocent', 'time', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Michael', 'Gerber', 'starting', 'middle', 'school', 'Everyone', 'invisible', 'friend', 'Fuzzbucket', 'just', 'Michael', 'acting', 'out', 'starting', 'MS.', 'How', 'are', 'Fuzzbucket', 'real', 'Once', 'visible', 'see', 'sort', 'looks', 'mixture', 'Alf', 'rat', 'Fuzzbucket', 'had', 'turned', 'invisible', 'was', 'away', 'home', 'midnight', 'sort', 'Gremlins', 'take', 'midnight', 'rule', 'Fuzzbucket', 'must', 'return', 'back', 'home', 'midnight', 'time', 'invisibility', 'will', 'be', 'permanent.Written', 'directed', 'great', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'produced', 'John', 'Landis', 'Fuzzbucket', 'simple', 'tale', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'enough', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'shown', 'Disney', 'are', 'refreshing', 'most', 'welcoming', 'age', 'where', 'everything', 'be', 'high', 'concept', 'high', 'maintenance', 'battling', 'other', 'be', 'hippest', 'edgiest', 'are', 'also', 'familiar', 'here', 'Joe', 'Regalbuto', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'John', 'Vernon', 'Animal', 'House', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'as', 'well', 'actresses', 'remember', 'seeing', 'growing', 'up', 'Fran', 'Ryan', 'Robyn', 'Lively', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'DVD', 'how', 'also', 'original', 'Disney', 'Sunday', 'Movie', 'opening', 'Michael', 'Eisner', 'intro', 'show', 'alongside', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'included', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'memories.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'say', 'Fuzzbucket', 'cute', 'charming', 'will', 'surely', 'bring', 'back', 'wave', 'nostalgia', 'time', 'when', 'something', 'was', 'shown', 'regularly', 'network', 'television', 'Now', 'Generation', 'Collection', 'maybe', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'Mr.Boogedy/Bride', 'Boogedy', 'Brand', 'New', 'Life', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Not', 'Quite', 'Normal', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'DVD', 'Thanks', 'Disney', 'lot', 'have', 'started', 'do']",Fuzzbucket

Originally shown on ABC network as part of their Sunday night movies (it may have also shown on the Disney Channel), this DVD is in its original full-frame format, or approximately 1.33:1. The video is average; looks like a copy from an old VHS tape, but since this was never released here in the United States, it's hard to verify this (although it may have been released on video overseas). It is finally available, though; best of all, the original opening for the Disney Movie is just before the movie, as is the original Michael Eisner introduction of the movie.
