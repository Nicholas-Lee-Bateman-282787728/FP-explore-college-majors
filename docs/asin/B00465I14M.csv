There were a few utterances of mild crude language, drinking of wine, a man tries to have a cigarette and low cut shirts on women. I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again. There were several parts that I thought could have been better, but it was still entertaining.I didn't like that Syd had so many issues with her mother. Apparently she is really angry that whenever she would call her father when he was dying, her mother was never home and so hates her for this. The thing is, Syd wasn't home either. She moved away to the big city, never came home until after her father died and is also angry with him for not holding on longer so she could find the &#34;cure&#34; to what he died from.I also didn't like that Syd's old high school sweetheart, Gus, didn't tell the girl he was dating, Connie, that he wasn't interested. She apparently has been married and divorced several times and is determined to make Gus her next husband. You can tell from the very beginning that he isn't at all interested, especially when Syd comes back home, but he still goes out with her even though he is embarrassed and a little uncomfortable with how she shows her affection. He clearly just likes her as a friend, but can't/won't tell her that.All in all, it was very entertaining and I would watch it again. It was funny, clean and a great &#34;feel-good&#34; movie.

I adored his acting in &#34;Love Comes Softly&#34; and other parts he's played, but in this movie he made his character seem like he really could care less if he got the girl. Lisa Hartman's acting was just okay. Perhaps, it is the director's fault in all of my complaints, not the actor's? The small town is picturesque and its scenes took me in, but the story did not. There are parts that I did like but they were not strong enough to carry out a well rounded movie.
