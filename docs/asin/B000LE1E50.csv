This movie is ok but doesn't have the same feel as the series...You just do not feel as connected to the characters as with the show. For me, it felt more forced and not as ""natural"". Also, there were some added elements that I personally don't feel were needed, namely the nudity. The show relies on the good scripting and funny story-lines...no need for boobs there. I felt it was a sell-out for the movie to go to that level and it was disappointing. Overall, although the camera work wasn't as ""mockumentary"" feeling as the series, and maybe the quick wit and funny lines weren't as often as the series, it is a must-have to round out your Trailer Park Boys collection. I highly recommend for Trailer Park newbies: Try the series first---it will give you the true magic of the Trailer Park Boys.

In other words, it's hard for me to laugh at the antics of this sort of person, because I know that, in the real world, these antics lead to a lot of pain.

But the main weapon is the remarkable cast, who are often brilliant in their roles. Front and centre is rum and coke fueled, low end criminal mastermind Julian (John Paul Temblay), volatile loose cannon Ricky (Robb Wells) and guiless cat lover Bubbles (Mike Smith). The chemistry between these three is true lightening in bottle TV magic. And they've got great opposition from alcoholic trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey (John Dunsworth) and his boyfriend/offsider Randy (Pat Roach). The more Lahey drinks, the more becomes like a demented white trash Captain Ahab, with Ricky as Moby Dick.And it's so damn funny. Sure it's full of dope, guns, drinking and other  mayhem, but the secret weapon is the wonderful warmth and likability of the hilarious characters.

They get educated in the brick and learn about ""the Big Dirty,"" that one job that will retire their career as criminals.  In  characteristic downsizing that is a necessity in trailer park living, the duo downsizes their version of the Big Dirty into something even less substantial than ATM machines.  Along the way Ricky tries to regain the interest of his girlfriend, who strays to become a stripper while he was in the joint, while Julian falls in love with another stripper.  All this while the gang has to deal with an evil trailer park supervisor who is a former cop.  As the story goes on, it becomes apparent that Ricky is more obsessed with returning to prison to head his cell mates' hockey team against that of the prison guards'.Julian, with his ubiquitous glass of rum and coke (I actually have friends like that) and Ricky, with hilarious pompadour make a good and convincing team for a reason: they are childhood friends in real life as well.  Throw in the entire gang (many who have been involved in each other's projects in the past) and you get a solid rapport behind the TV series that led to this movie.The film is also shot in beautiful 16mm color film, interspersed with handhelds, resulting in something that is a cross between Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and some of William Eggleston's most sublime moments on dye transfer.Fans of Canadian comedy (who can ever forget Boys in the Hall?) will definitely have a good feel for this film.  As for the rest of the folks who insist that art can only be measured using classic literature as a yardstick, they will do well to note that which the canon of Western literature itself has mined for comical and dramatic material over hundreds of years: the color and richness of the human story in the nether regions of society.",5,Gorgeously shot with very lovable Canucks,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,2606,"[""'m"", 'always', 'first', 'flinch', 'whenever', 'term', 'white', 'tr*sh', 'used', 'accidentally', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'was', 'hoped', 'Rhett', 'Ellis', 'novella', 'Greatest', 'White', 'Trash', 'Love', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'be.There', 'joy', 'crime', 'lot', 'booze', 'smoking', 'trailers', 'strip', 'joints', 'gang', 'colorful', 'characters', 'unexpected', 'sweet', 'moments', 'tenderness.I', 'was', 'wondering', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'timing', 'struck', 'note', 'familiarity', 'moment', 'saw', 'prisoners', 'playing', 'hockey', 'using', 'lunch', 'trays', 'protective', 'shields', 'gallon', 'milk', 'jugs', 'hocky', 'masks', 'immediately', 'became', 'apparent', 'American', 'prison.Ricky', 'Julian', 'are', 'Halifax', 'trailer', 'park', 'buddies', 'who', 'land', 'prison', 'heist', 'ATM', 'machine', 'backseat', 'full', 'cartons', 'cigarettes', 'get', 'educated', 'brick', 'learn', 'Big', 'Dirty', 'one', 'job', 'will', 'retire', 'career', 'criminals', 'characteristic', 'downsizing', 'necessity', 'trailer', 'park', 'living', 'duo', 'version', 'Big', 'Dirty', 'something', 'even', 'less', 'substantial', 'ATM', 'machines', 'way', 'Ricky', 'regain', 'interest', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'become', 'stripper', 'was', 'joint', 'Julian', 'falls', 'love', 'stripper', 'gang', 'deal', 'evil', 'trailer', 'park', 'supervisor', 'who', 'former', 'cop', 'story', 'apparent', 'Ricky', 'more', 'obsessed', 'returning', 'prison', 'head', 'cell', 'mates', 'hockey', 'team', 'prison', ""guards'.Julian"", 'ubiquitous', 'glass', 'rum', 'coke', 'actually', 'have', 'friends', 'Ricky', 'hilarious', 'pompadour', 'make', 'good', 'convincing', 'team', 'reason', 'are', 'childhood', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Throw', 'entire', 'gang', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'other', 'projects', 'past', 'get', 'solid', 'rapport', 'TV', 'series', 'led', 'movie.The', 'film', 'also', 'shot', 'beautiful', '16mm', 'color', 'film', 'interspersed', 'handhelds', 'resulting', 'something', 'cross', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'William', 'Eggleston', 'most', 'sublime', 'moments', 'dye', 'transfer.Fans', 'Canadian', 'comedy', 'who', 'can', 'ever', 'forget', 'Boys', 'Hall', 'will', 'definitely', 'have', 'good', 'feel', 'film', 'rest', 'folks', 'who', 'insist', 'art', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'measured', 'using', 'classic', 'literature', 'yardstick', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'note', 'canon', 'Western', 'literature', 'mined', 'comical', 'dramatic', 'material', 'hundreds', 'years', 'color', 'richness', 'human', 'story', 'nether', 'regions', 'society']",Trailer Park Boys - The Movie
