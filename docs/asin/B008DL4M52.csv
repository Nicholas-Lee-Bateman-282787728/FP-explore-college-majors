1551086,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B008DL4M52,Just some old guy.,"[8, 8]","I would give this about 4 and 1/2 stars. As far as the Animation goes it is by ""Studio Deen"" and as a whole is well above average. Take a little bit of Fate Stay Night with some Death Note animation and blend with the vibrant colors from Kanon and there you have it.This series starts out in late 1863 early 1864 and keeps you informed as to the date. A month may pass and it will say June 1864 so it does not leave you wondering. Even though a month may pass it still plays as a continuous story and not stand alone episodes.Voices are well done and no one seemed out of place. There are numerous characters that you are introduced to in this first part of the series. As for the main story it is about a girl whom goes looking for her father..the letters stop coming after he has been gone for sometime so she sets out to find him. Yet not dressed as girl but as a boy to attract less attention. However she encounters some trouble right at the start and sees something she was not suppose to see...enter the Shinsengumi...their strict code mandates that they kill her.That is pretty much what happens in the first 5 or 10 minutes and I will not tell anything more other than this was very good watch. Its is in a widescreen format..the 3 discs come inside one case but each one is on one side of a flip case insert...so they are not stacked upon one another.There is blood and you will see a limb or head come off and I do not really remember much bad language yet it says 17+ for the rating. As for me this was an excellent show it moved forward and never seemed to get bogged down. There are many characters yet all play an important part in the story. It blows having to wait till December 25th for the second part to come out and I believe part three is on Crunchyroll right now. This is a series I hope that keeps going, at least from what I have seen so far...it is well worth watching.",4,I'll have to kill you....,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,1895,"['would', 'give', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'As', 'far', 'Animation', 'Studio', 'Deen', 'whole', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'Take', 'little', 'bit', 'Fate', 'Stay', 'Night', 'Death', 'Note', 'animation', 'blend', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'Kanon', 'there', 'have', 'it.This', 'series', 'out', 'late', '1863', 'early', '1864', 'keeps', 'informed', 'date', 'month', 'may', 'pass', 'will', 'say', 'June', '1864', 'not', 'leave', 'wondering', 'Even', 'month', 'may', 'pass', 'still', 'continuous', 'story', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes.Voices', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'seemed', 'place', 'are', 'numerous', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'main', 'story', 'girl', 'whom', 'looking', 'father..the', 'letters', 'stop', 'coming', 'been', 'gone', 'sometime', 'out', 'find', 'not', 'dressed', 'girl', 'boy', 'attract', 'less', 'attention', 'However', 'trouble', 'right', 'start', 'sees', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'suppose', 'see', 'enter', 'Shinsengumi', 'strict', 'code', 'mandates', 'kill', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'first', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'anything', 'more', 'other', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'widescreen', 'format..the', '3', 'discs', 'come', 'one', 'case', 'one', 'one', 'side', 'flip', 'case', 'insert', 'are', 'not', 'stacked', 'one', 'blood', 'will', 'see', 'limb', 'head', 'come', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'remember', 'much', 'bad', 'language', 'yet', '17+', 'rating', 'was', 'excellent', 'show', 'moved', 'forward', 'never', 'seemed', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'yet', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'having', 'wait', 'till', 'December', '25th', 'second', 'part', 'come', 'believe', 'part', 'three', 'Crunchyroll', 'right', 'now', 'series', 'hope', 'going', 'least', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1551088,AV5RP5UDF1SSC,B008DL4M52,ls31,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed this anime. I have not played the Otome game. The animation is pretty and story interesting. However, the amount of historical information can be overwhelming at times: not surprising considering this take place prior to the Meiji revolution. Whether or not this was intentional, the political chaos and confusion of the time is successfully conveyed in this anime.The animation is beautiful and the Japanese vocal cast is great (English dub is available on DVD: it is not bad, but it falls somewhat flat compared to the Japanese language track).The main character is Chizuru Yukimura who set out on a quest to find her missing father. In order to facilitate her search, she disguise herself as a man (doing a poor job at it). She is fairly helpless. After witnessing the unfortunate results of an experiment gone awry, she is taken captive by the Shinsengumi ( in a sense a militia). Being unwilling to dispose of her, she is kept in captivity at their headquarters (though the motivation for keeping her alive are not entirely altruistic: her father conducted medical experiment on some of the Shinsengumi members and went missing shortly thereafter. It could be easily argued that she is kept alive as a valuable hostage rather than sheer chivalry).Regardless, the 12 episodes focus on the rise of the Shinsengumi and Chizuru relationship with them: moving from a captive to an ally (Stockholm syndrome anyone?). Romance is not at all prevalent, it is hinted at rather than expanded upon. The bonds between the characters are interesting and thankfully not romantic in nature.There is some supernatural element, but it is more a plot device.Anyway, this a great anime, I was very surprised that it would be this enjoyable (considering that it is coming from a dating sim game). There is something for everyone. Also, on the plus side: no fan service at all!",5,Too bad this was somewhat overlooked: great show,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,1870,"['enjoyed', 'anime', 'have', 'not', 'played', 'Otome', 'game', 'animation', 'pretty', 'story', 'interesting', 'However', 'amount', 'historical', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'times', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'take', 'place', 'prior', 'Meiji', 'revolution', 'not', 'was', 'intentional', 'political', 'chaos', 'confusion', 'time', 'successfully', 'conveyed', 'anime.The', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'vocal', 'cast', 'great', 'English', 'dub', 'available', 'DVD', 'not', 'bad', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'compared', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', '.The', 'main', 'character', 'Chizuru', 'Yukimura', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'find', 'missing', 'father', 'order', 'facilitate', 'search', 'man', 'doing', 'poor', 'job', 'fairly', 'helpless', 'witnessing', 'unfortunate', 'results', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'taken', 'captive', 'Shinsengumi', 'sense', 'militia', 'Being', 'unwilling', 'dispose', 'kept', 'captivity', 'headquarters', 'motivation', 'keeping', 'alive', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'altruistic', 'father', 'conducted', 'medical', 'experiment', 'Shinsengumi', 'members', 'went', 'missing', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'argued', 'kept', 'alive', 'valuable', 'hostage', 'rather', 'sheer', 'chivalry', '.Regardless', '12', 'episodes', 'focus', 'rise', 'Shinsengumi', 'Chizuru', 'relationship', 'moving', 'captive', 'ally', 'Stockholm', 'syndrome', 'anyone', 'Romance', 'not', 'prevalent', 'hinted', 'rather', 'expanded', 'upon', 'bonds', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'thankfully', 'not', 'romantic', 'supernatural', 'element', 'more', 'plot', 'device.Anyway', 'great', 'anime', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'considering', 'coming', 'dating', 'sim', 'game', 'something', 'everyone', 'Also', 'plus', 'side', 'fan', 'service']",N/A

1551090,AFV2584U13XP3,B008DL4M52,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","The series is extremely entertaining and very under looked one too, the series story focuses mainly on the the Shinsengumi a young waif girl Chizuru Yukimura who searches for her missing father and through certain situations ends up with the Shinsengumi and also as well the last years of the Shogunate and the strife that was happening in certain parts of Japan after the country was forced to open its doors to foreigners.  The story obviously has a mixture of truth/story and mysticism also while not extremely gory the sword fight scenes as well as some others can get bloody this is definitely no Pokemon show.  The animation is very good and the background scenery is beautiful as you can tell the animators took some extreme care for some of the scenes.  The Japanese and English voice cast did a terrific job playing their character roles and the soundtrack fits nicely with the series.  So if you like samurai series or just plain action series with a good story and a great cast of characters then here's a very good series to add to your anime library....",5,A Time Of Strife A Time Of Civil War And A Time For Bravery,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1066,"['series', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'very', 'looked', 'one', 'too', 'series', 'story', 'mainly', 'Shinsengumi', 'young', 'waif', 'girl', 'Chizuru', 'Yukimura', 'who', 'missing', 'father', 'certain', 'situations', 'up', 'Shinsengumi', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'years', 'Shogunate', 'strife', 'was', 'happening', 'certain', 'parts', 'Japan', 'country', 'was', 'forced', 'open', 'doors', 'foreigners', 'story', 'obviously', 'mixture', 'truth/story', 'mysticism', 'also', 'not', 'extremely', 'gory', 'sword', 'fight', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'can', 'get', 'bloody', 'definitely', 'Pokemon', 'show', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'background', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'can', 'tell', 'animators', 'took', 'extreme', 'care', 'scenes', 'Japanese', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'roles', 'soundtrack', 'nicely', 'series', 'like', 'samurai', 'series', 'just', 'plain', 'action', 'series', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'then', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'add', 'anime', 'library']",N/A
1551091,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B008DL4M52,W. Watson,"[0, 0]","I like this series because of the way it's different from other anime. It's historical. It relies more on characterization than conventional contrived anime drama. The characters are flawed in ways that make them seem more human. They make mistakes, and pay for them --sometimes with their lives. There's political intrigue, romance adventure and most importantly --sword fights!I went looking for an anime that was a little more adult oriented. My daughter's getting older now and so the cutesy animes she used to watch are giving way to more adult stories. (Thank goodness. No more Pretty Cure!). I wanted to find something that required a bit more intellect to watch and this is one of them.As I understand it, this anime is based off a game for girls --sort of like a reverse harem. You can see it right away because most of the characters seem bound to Chisuru in one way or another. The discussion has already started on who we each would like to see her end up with. I like the young girl who is the center of the story. She's not an invincible warrior, nor is she a lovable clueless clutz. When the story begins you can see the hints of her character and inner strength even though it's not always apparent on the outside. I like the fact that in the midst of all the conflict, she's struggling to find her own way among the Shinsengumi.I had to look some things up in order for the story to become clearer. It may help those of you watching it. The Shinsengumi were sort of like a cross between the police and special forces. Unlike other Samurai they did not serve feudal lords --but rather were tasked with protecting the city so they can also be referred to as Ronin.The Bakafu is basically the Shogun, or you could think of it as the office of the Shogun, or central command. The Shogun is not to be confused with the Emperor. The Emperor held very little actual power back in those days.One other thing you may find interesting is that almost all of the male characters are based on actual people from the period. So you can look them up on wikipedia if you want to see for yourself.I'm almost to the end of the firs season and I have to say it's quickly becoming one of my favorites.",5,A great historical Anime with some supernatural elements,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2198,"['like', 'series', 'way', 'different', 'other', 'anime', 'historical', 'more', 'characterization', 'conventional', 'contrived', 'anime', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'ways', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'human', 'make', 'mistakes', 'pay', 'sometimes', 'lives', 'political', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'adventure', 'most', 'importantly', 'sword', 'fights', 'went', 'looking', 'anime', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'daughter', 'getting', 'older', 'now', 'so', 'cutesy', 'used', 'watch', 'are', 'giving', 'way', 'more', 'adult', 'stories', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'more', 'Pretty', 'Cure', 'wanted', 'find', 'something', 'required', 'bit', 'more', 'intellect', 'watch', 'one', 'them.As', 'understand', 'anime', 'based', 'off', 'game', 'girls', 'sort', 'reverse', 'harem', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'most', 'characters', 'seem', 'bound', 'Chisuru', 'one', 'way', 'discussion', 'already', 'started', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'end', 'up', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'center', 'story', 'not', 'invincible', 'warrior', 'lovable', 'clueless', 'clutz', 'When', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'hints', 'character', 'inner', 'strength', 'even', 'not', 'always', 'apparent', 'outside', 'fact', 'midst', 'conflict', 'struggling', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'Shinsengumi.I', 'had', 'look', 'things', 'up', 'order', 'story', 'become', 'clearer', 'may', 'help', 'watching', 'Shinsengumi', 'were', 'sort', 'cross', 'police', 'special', 'forces', 'other', 'Samurai', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'feudal', 'lords', 'rather', 'were', 'tasked', 'protecting', 'city', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'referred', 'Ronin.The', 'Bakafu', 'basically', 'Shogun', 'could', 'think', 'office', 'Shogun', 'central', 'command', 'Shogun', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Emperor', 'Emperor', 'held', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'power', 'back', 'days.One', 'other', 'thing', 'may', 'find', 'interesting', 'almost', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'people', 'period', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'wikipedia', 'want', 'see', 'yourself.I', ""'m"", 'almost', 'end', 'firs', 'season', 'have', 'say', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A
