It's been great watching the first six seasons of this truly wonderful sitcom on DVD, shown just like it did when it first aired on NBC. True, there are a couple of episodes from seasons four, five, and six that featured some brief editing while seasons one, two, and three were pretty much edit free. The brief editing was a little disappointing, but nothing like the hack job that Lifetime has done to the episodes that have aired on the cable network for years.SEASON SEVEN (1991-92)Season Seven of ""The Golden Girls"" is just a notch below Season Six. Season Six was a pretty good season, though not quite as good as the first five seasons. Season Seven was in my opinion the weakest season of the show's seven year run, but that doesn't make it a completely bad season. There were episodes that made me laugh out loud; there were episodes that were marginally funny; and there were episodes that weren't as funny as they should've been. But the show made a very strong comeback to end the series with the last two episodes: the next-to-last episode (a two-parter) and of course the final one hour episode that ended the series' seven year run.The best episodes of Season Seven include: the girls going on a murder mystery weekend and Dorothy becoming a detective when a real murder occurs and Blanche is the prime suspect; Dorothy hiring a nurse to care for Sophia while Blanche enters her granddaughter into a kids beauty pageant; Stan going into therapy in trying to help him forget about Dorothy; a hurricane hitting Miami while Dorothy's sister Gloria visits; the girls traveling to Atlanta so that Blanche can make an attempt to save her grandmother's plantation; Sophia starts to date a man she met through the personals column only to be distracted by his sister who goes with them everywhere on their dates; Dorothy starts dating one of her high school teachers, while she and Blanche go on a talk-show that Rose is working for to talk about what it's like living together as roommates, only to find out at the beginning of the show that they are mistaken as lesbians, which infuriates them in the process; Dorothy trying to get on the game show ""Jeopardy!""; and Blanche inviting Dorothy out for a night on the town at Blanche's favorite bar, and Dorothy becoming the center of attention with her terrific singing talent.And of course there are those final two episodes, which work brilliantly not just for the laughs, but for the drama too. The two-part next-to-last episode, titled ""Home Again, Rose"" is an episode that combines big laughs with high drama. In this episode, Rose suffers a heart attack that requires serious open heart surgery. It's one of the most seriously dramatic episodes of ""The Golden Girls"", but it does contain some upbeat hilarious moments. The high comic point of the episode: Rose's dream that she, Dorothy, and Blanche all have their heads frozen. This scene is a comic masterpiece as the three ladies look absolutely ridiculous with their heads sticking up through the kitchen table simultaneously. And then there's the final episode: ""One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest"", in which Dorothy finds true love with Blanche's Uncle Lucas (played by Leslie Nielsen), and in the end decides to marry him, which in the process breaks up the old gang. The final scene of ""The Golden Girls"" is so touching that it brought a tear to my eye when it aired back on May 9, 1992. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful show.Before the beginning of the seventh season of ""The Golden Girls"", Beatrice Arthur announced that the seventh season would be her last. She apparently had had enough, and wanted to move on to other things. One major change the show had to endure for Season Seven was a new time slot. For its first six seasons ""The Golden Girls"" aired on NBC in the same time slot: Saturday nights - 9 p.m. Eastern/8 p.m. Central, and all six seasons the show finished each season in the Nielsen Top 10. For Season Seven, ""The Golden Girls"" continued to air on Saturday nights, but got moved up an hour to 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central. This move backfired, and the show fell out of the Nielsen Top 10 for the first time in the show's history. As a result, the show ended after its seventh season. But it didn't end for Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty. They went on to reprise their roles in the ""Golden Girls"" sequel show ""The Golden Palace.""For its final season, ""The Golden Girls"" didn't fare well at the Emmys. It only received three nominations for its last season, and for the first and only time it did not receive a nomination as Best Comedy Series. Betty White and Estelle Getty were nominated again as Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. White and Getty were nominated for all seven seasons. The other nomination it got for Season Seven was for a technical category which it won. So for its seven seasons ""The Golden Girls"" finished with a total of 68 Emmy nominations and 11 Emmy wins. Very impressive.""The Golden Girls"" always has and always will be my favorite show. Some great shows have preceded it (""Soap"", ""All in the Family""); other great shows have followed it (""Desperate Housewives"", ""House""). But nothing will ever top ""The Golden Girls"". It's the best TV show ever made.",4,The Golden Girls - Season Seven,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,5356,"['long', 'last', 'seventh', 'final', 'season', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'out',

Although many of episodes have their humor including the two-part Monkey Show where Stan uses a traffic cone monkey to get over Dorothy and then sleeps with Dorothy's visiting sister Gloria who has lost her money. Another wonderful episode is Goodbye Mr. Gordon where Dorothy's old high school teacher from New York visits starting a relationship with Dorothy. Meanwhile Rose becomes an associate producer for ""Wake Up Miami"" and convinces Dorothy and Blanche to appear on a show about Lesbian lovers of Miami.This seventh season of the Golden Girls is not a bad season, but it relies a lot on two part episodes and there where more episodes where the jokes or ideas where just lost on me like A Midwinter Nights Dream where Blanche throws a Moonlight Madness Party where all the guys are fawning all over Dorothy and ignoring Blanche and Miles decides to marry Rose to take advantage of a prize Rose won. The final episode still brings tears to my eyes and I rarely watch it because saying goodbye to the Golden Girls was like saying goodbye to a member of the family.

It's just a great way to end the day on a happy note, laughing out loud at Dorothy, Sophia, Blanche, and Rose!!! I've been waiting for the seventh and final season for a long time to enjoy some of my favorite episodes over and over again, like the one when the gals went on the murder mystery weekend. Too funny!!! There's a hurricane a comin is priceless when Blanche uses the telethon for a disgusting man hunt ( As Rose would say) and Dorothy catches Stan in bed with her sister twice, and demands the police on the scene shoot them.The two part episode of the moonlight madness party showed Blanche at her most beautiful. She looked absolutely stunning in that blue dress!!! I hope to look half that good when I become a golden girl!!!

1033751,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000KGGIL4,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[3, 3]","The seventh year of ""The Golden Girls"" would be their last as Bea Arthur informed the network and the producers that she was leaving the series. I believe Bea knew there were simply no more good stories to be told as the series became old and tiresome both in story content and direction at the beginning of the sixth year. In this 22 episode boxset the best show is the finale entitled ""One Flew Out Of The Cockoo's Nest"". One of the roomates gets married leaving behind the other three. That one episode brought the series back to its zenith resembling the shows from the first four years. There is great comedy, wonderful sadness, and most of all the actresses look like they were enjoying themselves with good material, although they knew it was the end. Important to note too is that NBC decided to air ""The Golden Girls"" an hour earlier on Saturday nights beginning in September, 1991 which was a death nell for the show as it finished the year at #30. The series, however, shot back into the top five with the final episode, a feat it last accomplished two years prior. The ending is one of the best in television history. Stupidly, the producers decided to bring the remaining ladies back in a sitcom called ""Golden Palace"" in the fall of 1992 on another network and new night. The series was a total failure and ""The Golden Girls"" disappeared forever with the exception of Estelle Getty who brought her character to NBC's ""Empty Nest"". Thankfully, however, we can enjoy all ""The Golden Girls"" episodes ( seven boxsets worth) on DVD format, uncut and without commercials. ""The Golden Girls"", after having 180 shows produced, will live on as being one of the greatest sitcoms in broadcast history.",5,"""The End of ""The Golden Girls""""",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,1704,"['seventh', 'year', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'informed', 'network', 'producers', 'was', 'leaving', 'series', 'believe', 'Bea', 'knew', 'were', 'simply', 'no', 'more', 'good', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'series', 'became', 'old', 'tiresome', 'story', 'content', 'direction', 'beginning', 'sixth', 'year', '22', 'episode', 'boxset', 'best', 'show', 'finale', 'entitled', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cockoo', 'Nest', 'One', 'roomates', 'married', 'leaving', 'other', 'three', 'one', 'episode', 'brought', 'series', 'back', 'zenith', 'resembling', 'shows', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'great', 'comedy', 'wonderful', 'sadness', 'most', 'actresses', 'look', 'were', 'enjoying', 'good', 'material', 'knew', 'was', 'end', 'Important', 'note', 'too', 'NBC', 'decided', 'air', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'hour', 'earlier', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'beginning', 'September', '1991', 'was', 'death', 'nell', 'show', 'finished', 'year', '30', 'series', 'however', 'shot', 'back', 'top', 'five', 'final', 'episode', 'feat', 'last', 'accomplished', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'ending', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'history', 'Stupidly', 'producers', 'decided', 'bring', 'remaining', 'ladies', 'back', 'sitcom', 'called', 'Golden', 'Palace', 'fall', '1992', 'network', 'new', 'night', 'series', 'was', 'total', 'failure', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'disappeared', 'forever', 'exception', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'who', 'brought', 'character', 'NBC', 'Empty', 'Nest', 'Thankfully', 'however', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'episodes', 'seven', 'boxsets', 'worth', 'DVD', 'format', 'uncut', 'commercials', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'having', '180', 'shows', 'produced', 'will', 'live', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'broadcast', 'history']",The Golden Girls: The Complete Seventh and Final Season
