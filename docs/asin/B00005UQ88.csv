684977,AUD70DIG2R8E6,B00005UQ88,"David Addis ""King Of The Ol' Skool""","[0, 0]","The first cartoon to launch the career of Gary Owens, whose other credit to fame was the wild announcer on the NBC comedy ""Rowan And Martin's Laugh-In"". He voices Roger Ramjet, Hero Of Our Nation, by getting into one boneheaded mess after another to save the country from some of its dopiest villains. My favorite is Redbeard The Pirate, who was intent on sabotaging The U.S. Navy by cutting off the rudders to all their ships. A ""discount house"" parrot adds to the hilarity as the mission leads to disastrous results. Capturing Ramjet was Redbeard's biggest mistake but it doesn't end like you think it does. Ramjet tries to take his Proton Pill, which gives him the strength of 20 atom bombs for a period of 20 seconds. Unfortunately, the parrot eats the pill, but decides on his own revenge against his master (""I have hated you for years, now I'm gonna do something about it!""). The laughter ensues when the beating begins! This ditty ends with ""Anchors Aweigh"". If you want extreme laughter and a bit of nostalgia, then look no further than here. I promise you a bad condition of lung burn after you stop laughing. No other cartoon (gaudy or otherwise) can never have the power that this series ever had, and I am not wrong!",5,"""Roger Ramjet, Hero Of Our Laughter""!-Salsoul Connection Ol' Skool Rarities!",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1229,"['first', 'cartoon', 'launch', 'career', 'Gary', 'Owens', 'other', 'credit', 'fame', 'was', 'wild', 'announcer', 'NBC', 'comedy', 'Rowan', 'Martin', 'Laugh-In', 'Roger', 'Ramjet', 'Hero', 'Nation', 'getting', 'one', 'boneheaded', 'mess', 'save', 'country', 'dopiest', 'villains', 'favorite', 'Redbeard', 'Pirate', 'who', 'was', 'intent', 'sabotaging', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'cutting', 'off', 'rudders', 'ships', 'discount', 'house', 'parrot', 'hilarity', 'mission', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Capturing', 'Ramjet', 'was', 'Redbeard', 'biggest', 'mistake', ""n't"", 'end', 'think', 'Ramjet', 'tries', 'take', 'Proton', 'Pill', 'strength', '20', 'atom', 'bombs', 'period', '20', 'seconds', 'Unfortunately', 'parrot', 'pill', 'own', 'revenge', 'master', 'have', 'hated', 'years', 'now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'do', 'something', 'laughter', 'when', 'beating', 'ditty', 'Anchors', 'Aweigh', 'want', 'extreme', 'laughter', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'here', 'promise', 'bad', 'condition', 'lung', 'burn', 'stop', 'laughing', 'other', 'cartoon', 'gaudy', 'otherwise', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'power', 'series', 'ever', 'had', 'am', 'not', 'wrong']",N/A

The sarcastic, hackmied animation is still there along with precocious political satire and social commentary.

684979,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B00005UQ88,Jonathan Cohen,"[4, 4]","This was the first DVD of ""Roger Ramjet"", that quirky little cartoon of the '60s with the Hollywood/old-time radio/Jay Ward-ish pedigree. It's a great intro to this underrated series, which was really a bunch of clever little comedy skits that could have been part of period AM radio. What I love about ""Roger"" is its creative team: some of the best Hollywood comedy writers and radio pros of the day, all in a cutting-up mood for kids of all ages. I've discussed them elsewhere, but these were the guys who wrote bits for everyone from Bob Hope to Carol Burnett to Johnny Carson; the late Gene Moss, who wrote every episode, had a lifelong love for witty kiddie shows (his ""Shrimpenstein"", with a mini-monster puppet, was the best-loved such show in LA for years). The plus on this DVD is a brief but very entertaining commentary by Gary Owens, who goes over the characters and crew in his trademark booming/witty style. This not only includes a brief summary of each episode, but- if you move the menu ""wings"" to the kids' heads- an ""outtake"" reel that mixes random sequences (like Roger in a red wig as ""Miss Ramjet"") with some classic Owens-isms (""Love is the soy sauce on the chop suey of life""). Don't miss Gary's story about his trip to Vancouver with Tom Selleck- the payoff will positively floor you. If it sounds like I'm an unabashed Owens fan, you're right, but some of the situations Roger gets dropped into are quite funny in that '60s MAD-magazine way. If you're new to ""Roger Ramjet"" or love old-school, kids-of-all-ages satire, this is probably all the Roger you'd ever want. If you want more, well, ""make sure you keep watching or you'll get...drafted!"" (I assure you that was quite edgy for a period cartoon.)",4,SUFFERING SOLENOIDS!
