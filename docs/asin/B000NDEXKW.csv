We've purchased all the series we won't at this time. The only season I won't purchase is season 5, we didn't like it at all.  This season was my most recent purchase from Amazon, it was on sale for under 25.00, I don't know what the deal is about the slim pack, I guess it's to save on packing, so long as it's not missing in parts, it's fine.  My purchase price has ranged anywhere from 17.99 to 40.00.  I agree with one viewer who wrote on a side note about how ridiculous the price point is from Amazon for the slim pack.

1056213,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B000NDEXKW,Joseph Boone,"[7, 8]","Season 4 begins with Jack Bauer working for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller. We have a new president in the form of John Keeler and most of the faces in CTU are also new. In addition, Jack has a new girlfriend in the form of Audrey Raines, daughter to Jack's boss. Jack, Audrey, and Heller are visiting L.A. when terrorist activity begins to heat up in a way that involves them very directly. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Jack to be thrust back into action to stop the bad guys. Normally, I write reviews that offer a bit more info on the plot, but with this show I'm not comfortable doing that. Too much of the punch that 24 has to offer comes from all the twists and turns of the story and giving those away is not fair to new viewers.As mentioned, there are many new faces in the cast this season and most of them work pretty well. Curtis Manning makes a good no-nonsense agent with a solid presence. Erin Driscoll is the new head of CTU Los Angeles and looks like a moronic bureaucrat in the first couple of episodes but then mercifully starts to act in a much more competent fashion. In addition to all the new faces, a few old friends return as the season progresses. A surprise absence was Kim Bauer, for which I was highly grateful. Probably the worst character depiction was Chloe O'Brian. She was quirky and abrasive in24 - Season Threebut I liked her for the most part. This season, she is just rude and condescending every time she opens her mouth no matter what the situation is. It's so over the top that it really doesn't make any sense at all and is just irritating to watch.Without giving away specifics, the plot is another case of very mixed quality ideas. The first half to two-thirds of the season is relatively tight and holds up well but then it stumbles badly. You start seeing things like a terrorist driving a jeep on a deserted road in the desert and yet a CTU helicopter can't find him. A company is afraid that computer records might make them look bad so they take actions that would be guaranteed to land the executives in jail for life and get the corporation shut down forever. A man is badly wounded and instead of taking him to a hospital, they take him to the little clinic at CTU. All of these things are contrivances to make things harder for Jack either immediately or later on, but they are so poorly conceived that they badly undermine the credibility of the show as you watch it.Trying to give 24-Season 4 a rating in stars is difficult because the season fluctuates so wildly in quality almost from minute to minute. At it's best, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. At it's worst, you'll roll your eyes and grind your teeth as yet another arbitrary obstacle is thrown in Jack's way that makes no sense whatsoever. The soap opera that occurs between various characters also gets very tiresome. After watching the first four seasons on DVD (I've never watched the show on TV) I can say that more and more plot elements are getting recycled and the magic is starting to wear off for me. I may buy the next season at some point, but I'm ready for some time off after watching this one. I would recommend this only to people who really loved the first three seasons and are hungry for more.",3,Uneven quality undermines this wild ride,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,3252,"['Season', '4', 'begins', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'working', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'have', 'new', 'president', 'form', 'John', 'Keeler', 'most', 'CTU', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'addition', 'Jack', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'form', 'Audrey', 'Raines', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'boss', 'Jack', 'Audrey', 'Heller', 'are', 'visiting', 'L.A.', 'when', 'terrorist', 'activity', 'heat', 'up', 'way', 'very', 'directly', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Jack', 'be', 'thrust', 'back', 'action', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'Normally', 'write', 'reviews', 'offer', 'bit', 'more', 'info', 'plot', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'doing', 'Too', 'much', 'punch', '24', 'offer', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'not', 'fair', 'new', 'viewers.As', 'mentioned', 'are', 'many', 'new', 'cast', 'season', 'most', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'Curtis', 'Manning', 'good', 'no-nonsense', 'agent', 'solid', 'presence', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'new', 'head', 'CTU', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'moronic', 'bureaucrat', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'then', 'mercifully', 'act', 'much', 'more', 'competent', 'fashion', 'addition', 'new', 'few', 'old', 'friends', 'return', 'season', 'surprise', 'absence', 'was', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'was', 'highly', 'grateful', 'Probably', 'worst', 'character', 'depiction', 'was', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'was', 'quirky', 'abrasive', 'in24', 'Season', 'Threebut', 'liked', 'most', 'part', 'season', 'just', 'rude', 'condescending', 'time', 'mouth', 'matter', 'what', 'situation', 'so', 'top', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'just', 'irritating', 'watch.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'specifics', 'plot', 'case', 'very', 'mixed', 'quality', 'ideas', 'first', 'half', 'two-thirds', 'season', 'relatively', 'tight', 'up', 'well', 'then', 'badly', 'start', 'seeing', 'things', 'terrorist', 'driving', 'jeep', 'deserted', 'road', 'desert', 'yet', 'CTU', 'helicopter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'company', 'afraid', 'computer', 'records', 'might', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'take', 'actions', 'would', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'land', 'executives', 'jail', 'life', 'get', 'corporation', 'shut', 'down', 'forever', 'man', 'badly', 'wounded', 'instead', 'taking', 'hospital', 'take', 'little', 'clinic', 'CTU', 'things', 'are', 'contrivances', 'make', 'things', 'harder', 'Jack', 'immediately', 'later', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'badly', 'undermine', 'credibility', 'show', 'watch', 'it.Trying', 'give', '24-Season', '4', 'rating', 'stars', 'difficult', 'season', 'so', 'wildly', 'quality', 'almost', 'minute', 'minute', 'best', 'edge', 'seat', 'worst', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'grind', 'teeth', 'yet', 'arbitrary', 'obstacle', 'thrown', 'Jack', 'way', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'soap', 'opera', 'various', 'characters', 'also', 'very', 'tiresome', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'TV', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'more', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'getting', 'recycled', 'magic', 'starting', 'wear', 'off', 'may', 'buy', 'next', 'season', 'point', ""'m"", 'ready', 'time', 'off', 'watching', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'hungry', 'more']",N/A

Herzog,"[0, 0]","24, a show known for surprising its audience with its great twists and turns, surprises its audiences in its ability to continually improve with each season.  I did not think that there was a way for season 3 to be topped, but I was wrong.  Season 4 not only had a great story, the writing turned a corner as well.  While Season 2 and Season 3 struggled at times to include a story for every character, this time, the story progresses on its own, and the characters are included only when they are relevant to the story.  Also, I did not feel, like other seasons, as if the changes in story were changed continually to keep the momentum going, but felt the entire story was congruent from begining until the end.Needless to say I was very surprised by Season 4's ability to improve an already great show.  I can't wait to watch season 5, and see where the show goes from there.

The explosive opener is mentioned as one of the strong points of the series, but it is really eclipsed in my eyes by the fantastic level maintained throughout all 24 episodes.The characters and character development is an essential aspect of the show's success this year. There are now characters you genuinely care about, truly despise or even feel sorrow at their respective demises.
