Most of the flight action was live action and the realism shows. The digital expansion (there simply aren't that many of these aircraft in existence anymore) blended well with the live action and for the most part appeared realistic. The action scenes were effectively linked to and advanced the story / biography. The acting was good.When I walk out of most movies I think they are poorly edited and that they were too long or that the story was dragged out (or maybe it is that I recently saw part 1 of the Hobbit). However, I wanted this to be a longer film, and it quite easily could have been without dragging it out. More Wellum - he was used well but his involvment was what made this film very special. More connecting the characters to the key events in the Battle of Britain, and connecting the dots to events in 1941. It seemed that all of a sudden his 18 months were up. More character development about Wellum's personal life and how it was effected by his breakdown.Please - make part 2 of this biography. There are so few good movies about the siege of Malta, and this would make a great one with Wellum's eventual breakdown and return to be a test pilot and to marry in 1944.

Now &#34;First Light&#34; portrays the truth. I knew a Polish Battle of Britain pilot who flew for the RAF during the September 1940 peak of the battle. In three weeks he destroyed 15 German aircraft as certified in his RAF logbook making him the second highest scoring Polish Battle of Britain pilot. He told me how the effect on him of these three weeks was absolutely crushing and mind numbing. Like many Poles, he wanted to kill the men in the German planes, not just disable the planes like the British pilots. They hated the Germans with a passion for the rape and murder of their country and people. He said he could barely walk when his squadron was transferred to Scotland for convalescence and recovery. He was later shot down over France and escaped from Stalag Luft 3 with Robert Stanford Tuck just before the Great Escape &#34;walking&#34; back to England across Poland and Russia.

I have been a Spitfire addict since my early childhood growing up around A/C & have been fortunate enough to talk with a few RAF & RCAF pilots who flew Hurricanes & Spitfires during WW2. Actually the Hurricane had a higher kill ratio than the Spitfire during the Battle of Britain but that's another story. For those of you who are pilots , remember your first solo when your instructor told you to stop on the taxi-way, got out turning you loose on your own. That part in the movie as Geoff arrived at the base with the original Spitfire Pilot's notes on his lap to me was a story on it's own , you didn't have the opportunity to have an instructor along for the ride in a single seat fighter to offer advice,help,etc. Progressing through your training you're now deemed fit to fly a fighter A/C . You have no combat experience but you may or may not have anytime flying Spitfires. Can you imagine the pressure on you ? Is it any wonder your memory turns to mush while being briefed by your ground crew on engine starting procedures & the rest is up to you. A new kid on the block & only eighteen years old in control of the latest fighter A/C of it's time, scarey ? But that's the way it was. I find in this day & age a lot of people just can't visualize that these pilots just didn't go up against the enemy who vastly outnumbered them but the weather they often flew in was often to prove fatal to their existence. And remember these young pilots were not seasoned veterans, it was a learning curve of you lived or died , veteran or rookie. I myself completely enjoyed the film,especially the bit parts of the real Geoffrey Wellum speaking of his experiences. Vastly outnumbered & fighting against seasoned German fighter pilots in their latest fighter A/C I think a person has to recognize what a disadvantage Britain was up against. For the true Spitfire lover & history buff you will see a few inaccuracies such as late model Spitfires that never flew in the Battle of Britain with their 4-blade props,dual under wing cooling scoops , late model exhaust stubs & rectangular gun sights BUT we're 70+ years into the future from the projected time period, original Spitfires of the early "" Marks & Models "" are very scarce so I find such an inaccuracy excusable. As a lover of these A/C & times the movie held my full attention.  As a pilot I just loved all the cockpit shots , procedures, etc and as a history buff of this time period in history the movie captured my full attention & most of all this movie wasn't based on a Hollywood script but actually portrays the Battle of Britain from the youngest pilot to fly & fight in the Battle of Britain telling it like it was.

1459782,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005G4928Q,Tommy Dooley,"[64, 66]","I started watching this with no expectations, and after 5 minutes I was totally hooked. It tells of the real life experiences of Geoffrey Wellum, the youngest Spitfire pilot of WW 2. It is from his memoir and he is featured in this film. Although it is a drama his pieces to camera are as moving as the film.He gets posted and is taken under the wing of the Flight Commander; they all develop a really tight bond and have their own ways of dealing with loss. The aerial fight scenes are amazing, and the CGI is so good that I kept thinking it must be real planes - which I am sure there were for parts of the film. It is hard to say too much without being a plot spoiler, but it deals with his determination to prove himself, his love life and what happens when battle fatigue takes its toll.I was genuinely moved by this film and felt very emotional at the end. It is so important to remember all of those who died in WW 2 and the Battle of Britain is to be especially so for it was when Britain stood alone. With the exception of volunteers from around the world, these were mostly young, lacking in experience and had not really had a chance to live their lives. Yet they all went up every time it was asked of them this is a great testament to those few men.
