I cannot recommend it and I'm an avid Christmas movie fan.  It has a very appearling artwork, but it just isn't a good movie.

I don't usually have a problem with predictable as long as it's entertaining but Chilly Christmas misses the mark for me. Chilly, the dog is the best part of the movie but he's not the ultimate in endearing animals. That said, Your kids may enjoy this movie, but adults might want to lower their expectations.",3,So So,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,446,"['love', 'animals', 'xmas', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'shoe-in', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'slow', 'moving', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'problem', 'predictable', 'as', 'long', 'entertaining', 'Chilly', 'Christmas', 'mark', 'Chilly', 'dog', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'ultimate', 'endearing', 'animals', 'said', 'Your', 'kids', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'adults', 'might', 'want', 'lower', 'expectations']",Chilly Christmas
1579136,A14482T71JR6VU,B0090EDEWI,"Lizz A. Belle ""lizzabelle, English major nerd""","[6, 6]","I watched this movie with expectations of it being mediocre but I was surprised. Some parts of the movie are quite funny and you will absolutely want to take Chilly Christmas (the dog's name) home with you forever. The rest of the characters are also quite endearing, although I found myself thinking Tom Arnold made somewhat of a lackluster villian.The basic plot is that a boy, Bobby, (maybe 10?) and his father live in what I believe is the small, fictitous town of Sunshine Beach, California. Somewhere along the line dad (an above average police detective with a stellar apprehension rate) has become a widower (mom was also a police officer) and he and his son are clearly still trying to cope with the loss even though you get the idea it has been a while since mom's passing. The story opens on Bobby at the Christmas tree opening his presents. Except the puppy he was to receive has escaped and a chase around the Christmas tree ensues. The dog becomes Chilly Christmas (the breed is supposed a rare Koren one but my household suspects Chilly is actually an otterhound) and Chilly does not believe in discipline. One year later we find, like every other silly dog movie, Chilly destroys most everything he gets near. This becomes problematic when Bobby's dad is asked to join the FBI to head a task force in New York, where Chilly will have no wide open backyard to frollick and dad fears he will destroy the apartment. Meanwhile, multiple kennels and pet stores are being broken into with valuable rare dogs being stolen for some nefarious purpose never revealed other than the kidnappers are set to make lots of money. Naturally when dad puts Chilly, this rare dog breed, on an adoption website, the dog nappers close in and try to steal him. This is all unbeknownst to Bobby, who is trying train Chilly to become an indoor dog with the help of his friends Kizzy (a tomboy) and an absolutely great little boy named Caps (explained in the film, he was my favorite character). Eventually the police, including Bobby's dad, figure out who the dog nappers are but it is Bobby who saves the day and Chilly.The plot is predictable but most movies like this are. However, the writing for this movie is good, the acting is not too bad and Chilly is so cute! The good thing about this movie is you can watch it with young children. The villian is hardly even worth a gasp let alone frightening and the hijinks will keep little ones amused. Dog lovers will like watching the struggles with Chilly and the unorthodox training methods used to make him an indoor dog. This may not be an annual watching like some other holiday classics but it is good enough to add to your Christmas movie collection and watch on some wintery weather day where you just want a good movie and a cup of hot chocolate. Highly recommend.",4,An adorable family movie,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,2814,"['watched', 'movie', 'expectations', 'being', 'mediocre', 'was', 'surprised', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'will', 'absolutely', 'want', 'take', 'Chilly', 'Christmas', 'dog', 'name', 'home', 'forever', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'endearing', 'found', 'thinking', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'made', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'villian.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'boy', 'Bobby', 'maybe', '10', 'father', 'live', 'what', 'believe', 'small', 'fictitous', 'town', 'Sunshine', 'Beach', 'California', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'dad', 'above', 'average', 'police', 'detective', 'stellar', 'apprehension', 'rate', 'become', 'widower', 'mom', 'was', 'also', 'police', 'officer', 'son', 'are', 'clearly', 'still', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss', 'even', 'get', 'idea', 'been', 'while', 'mom', 'passing', 'story', 'Bobby', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'opening', 'presents', 'puppy', 'was', 'receive', 'escaped', 'chase', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ensues', 'dog', 'Chilly', 'Christmas', 'breed', 'supposed', 'rare', 'Koren', 'one', 'household', 'Chilly', 'actually', 'otterhound', 'Chilly', 'not', 'believe', 'discipline', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'find', 'other', 'silly', 'dog', 'movie', 'Chilly', 'most', 'everything', 'near', 'problematic', 'when', 'Bobby', 'dad', 'asked', 'join', 'FBI', 'head', 'task', 'force', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Chilly', 'will', 'have', 'wide', 'open', 'backyard', 'frollick', 'dad', 'fears', 'will', 'destroy', 'apartment', 'Meanwhile', 'multiple', 'kennels', 'pet', 'stores', 'are', 'being', 'broken', 'valuable', 'rare', 'dogs', 'being', 'stolen', 'nefarious', 'purpose', 'never', 'revealed', 'other', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'set', 'make', 'lots', 'money', 'Naturally', 'when', 'dad', 'Chilly', 'rare', 'dog', 'breed', 'adoption', 'website', 'dog', 'nappers', 'close', 'try', 'steal', 'unbeknownst', 'Bobby', 'who', 'trying', 'train', 'Chilly', 'become', 'indoor', 'dog', 'help', 'friends', 'Kizzy', 'tomboy', 'absolutely', 'great', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Caps', 'explained', 'film', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'Eventually', 'police', 'including', 'Bobby', 'dad', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'dog', 'nappers', 'are', 'Bobby', 'who', 'day', 'Chilly.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'However', 'writing', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Chilly', 'so', 'cute', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'young', 'children', 'villian', 'hardly', 'even', 'gasp', 'let', 'alone', 'frightening', 'hijinks', 'will', 'keep', 'little', 'ones', 'amused', 'Dog', 'lovers', 'will', 'like', 'watching', 'struggles', 'Chilly', 'unorthodox', 'training', 'methods', 'used', 'make', 'indoor', 'dog', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'annual', 'watching', 'other', 'holiday', 'classics', 'good', 'enough', 'add', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'collection', 'watch', 'wintery', 'weather', 'day', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'movie', 'cup', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'Highly', 'recommend']",Chilly Christmas
