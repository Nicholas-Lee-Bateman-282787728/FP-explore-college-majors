I did not check the writer, but whoever wrote must be Perry himself or one of his disciples!  This film is dull, cliche, uninteresting and it even has the obligatory illuminati gay agenda in it - of course.The male star of the film is known for his afro and he seems like a nice guy, but he is not funny!  He needs to stick to his 'other market...'  Kerry Washington was looking as cute as usual, although still showing skin - as usual.  David Alan Grier has dull stand up, but this type of comedy seemed to fit his style perfectly!  His lines were the only things funny in this film!  If he were not in it, I would have given this one star!  He was actually funny in this!  The grey hair seems to better fit him too for some reason.If it were not for the nice looking women (the mother included), this film would not have kept my attention.  Too bad two of the women had to be gay - fitting in with the ORDER'S agenda that any player MUST obey and include or they do not get any projects released!  We really do not need to see the gay thing nor do we want to, but the powers that be want to beat us over the head with these things, so until we do something about them, we will have to deal with them.Melvin Van &#34;Peeples&#34; makes a cameo as well as the very elderly and surgically altered looking Diane Carroll.  They were good to see and Peeples has aged better than Carroll.  Overall, this is something to watch just to say you saw it, but nothing worth buying to coming back to.

The disrespect of women in Peeples and the condoning of Lesbianism was awful. This is not something that your target audience (Christians) is suppose to be supporting.  The world is right now a modern day Sodem and Gomorrah and I do not think it is funny. Girls are being raped on college campuses and in homes and it is an epidemic!The Movie: It was about a guy who went to his girlfriends home for a weekend to announce he is to wed Kerry Washington.  The dad did not like him and let him know. He met men she had slept with in her past and got mad.  The dad was immersed in sin or nude swimming with the mayor.  The mom was an alcoholic and a past half naked singer of raunchy songs. Kerry's sister was a dike (as she said). Kerry's brother wastroubled and stealing from his own family(mom's gold earrings) and playing with ladies underwear in his room and had a poster of a woman on his wall wearing boys short panties. Kerry's dad watched her get a spanking by her boyfriend from outside a window. Needless to say he was scarred.  A threesome was offered to a male houseguest by kerry's sister who is a lesbian. She came out over the weekend and told her dad she was gay.This movie was awful and none of these people were leading a life anyone in their right mind would aspire to have.  It was suppose to be funny but it was downright sad. Does Mr. Perry really think sin that put Jesus up on that cross to die an agonizing death is so funny? I had given up on seeing Tyler Perry movies, but I saw that Kerry Washington was in the film and I decided to give it a try. I did not read the ratings as I always do.  I made a mistake. I will not do that again.I think this film had so much potential to be good.  Perhaps Mr. Perry should get some little ones to help him write his scripts.

The age old question is can a man ever be good enough for your father?  Grier (Judge Peeples) is a serious character playing the role of a wealthy Federal Judge.  Craig Robinson (the boyfriend) is a talented kids kouncelor (with a K since he isn't licensed).  Basically you follow a sequence of events where the judge and his family is ""supposed"" to be perfect but end up being a normal family with issues like everyone else.

I am a christian but I will not stop loving my child if she comes out as gay.  The movie doesn't promote it, it is sharing the fact that the family isn't ""perfect"".
