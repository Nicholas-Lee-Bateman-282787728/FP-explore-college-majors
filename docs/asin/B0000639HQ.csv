694534,A4KNOE8YJJUMR,B0000639HQ,Alec McMullen,"[0, 2]","Here's another staggeringly unoriginal and unfunny kids comedy from Disney, where the future of the film is set up before the screenwriters type one word of it up: take a silly, clich&eacute;d plot, with stereotype characters, put in all the clich&eacute;s in the world into the script including an inevitable, shallow moral at the end, and sign on some child actors in the cast who kids today are familiar with. Throw in one or two possible adult comedians or rising child stars and you've got a sure moneymaker relying solely on parents taking their kids to see the fluff. Disney has used the formula for many decades, especially the nineties. It can be applied to almost any of their live-action family films, such as The Apple Dumpling Gang (Which was still somewhat enjoyable), First Kid, the awful The Pacifier, and others. The movies don't need to make lots of money, just enough profit to set them with a couple million more than their tiny budgets give them. That isn't hard.In Max Keeble's Big Move, the adults are the goat of almost every joke so it's hard to see them buying it for their kids. The billions of clich&eacute;s in it make it nearly unwatchable for anyone with any sort of movie discretion at all.Max Keeble suffers from bullies who make typically lame taunts and stuff in school. He's picked on by the typically annoying and snobby principal (with typically abominable dialogue). He has a huge crush on the typically nasty popular girl who hangs out with the typically magnetic suck-up friends who would follow her through a tar pit. So when his typically retarded parents tell him he's moving, Max pulls all the typical pratfalls and pranks in these movies on the bullies in his school for a week, until he finds out the deepest plot twist you'll find here: he's not moving! Now he has to stand up to the bullies he played pranks on. And when he hangs out with the popular kids for a night his real friends abandon him, where another shallow moral makes its way into the film; something about ""not hanging out with people that don't dance and shake their booties on diner tables at night for fun.""Another scene finds the principal literally trying to kill young Max by locking him in his favorite pet shelter that's about to bulldozed. I was actually rooting for the principal, if only because for the first time in this movie something unexpected would happen. But nothing unexpected ever happens.I'm surprised the Golden Razzie Awards overlooked this movie when it came out. Max Keeble's Big Move is so stupid it gives these clich&eacute;d kids movies a bad name.",1,Must-miss for anyone over the age of 10,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2592,"['Here', 'staggeringly', 'unoriginal', 'unfunny', 'kids', 'comedy', 'Disney', 'where', 'future', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'screenwriters', 'type', 'one', 'word', 'take', 'silly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'plot', 'stereotype', 'characters', 'put', 'clich', 'eacute', 'world', 'script', 'including', 'inevitable', 'shallow', 'moral', 'end', 'sign', 'child', 'actors', 'cast', 'who', 'today', 'are', 'familiar', 'Throw', 'one', 'two', 'possible', 'adult', 'comedians', 'rising', 'child', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sure', 'moneymaker', 'relying', 'solely', 'parents', 'taking', 'kids', 'see', 'fluff', 'Disney', 'used', 'formula', 'many', 'decades', 'especially', 'nineties', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'almost', 'live-action', 'family', 'films', 'such', 'Apple', 'Dumpling', 'Gang', 'Which', 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'First', 'Kid', 'awful', 'Pacifier', 'others', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'lots', 'money', 'just', 'enough', 'profit', 'set', 'couple', 'million', 'more', 'tiny', 'budgets', 'give', ""n't"", 'hard.In', 'Max', 'Keeble', 'Big', 'Move', 'adults', 'are', 'goat', 'almost', 'joke', 'hard', 'see', 'buying', 'kids', 'billions', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'make', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'anyone', 'sort', 'movie', 'discretion', 'all.Max', 'Keeble', 'suffers', 'bullies', 'who', 'make', 'typically', 'lame', 'taunts', 'stuff', 'school', 'picked', 'typically', 'annoying', 'snobby', 'principal', 'typically', 'abominable', 'dialogue', 'huge', 'crush', 'typically', 'nasty', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'typically', 'magnetic', 'suck-up', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'follow', 'tar', 'pit', 'So', 'when', 'typically', 'retarded', 'parents', 'tell', 'moving', 'Max', 'typical', 'pratfalls', 'pranks', 'movies', 'bullies', 'school', 'week', 'out', 'deepest', 'plot', 'twist', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'not', 'moving', 'Now', 'stand', 'up', 'bullies', 'played', 'pranks', 'when', 'out', 'popular', 'kids', 'night', 'real', 'friends', 'abandon', 'where', 'shallow', 'moral', 'way', 'film', 'something', 'not', 'hanging', 'out', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'dance', 'shake', 'booties', 'diner', 'tables', 'night', 'fun', 'scene', 'principal', 'literally', 'trying', 'kill', 'young', 'Max', 'locking', 'favorite', 'pet', 'shelter', 'bulldozed', 'was', 'actually', 'rooting', 'principal', 'only', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'something', 'unexpected', 'would', 'happen', 'nothing', 'unexpected', 'ever', 'happens.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Golden', 'Razzie', 'Awards', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Max', 'Keeble', 'Big', 'Move', 'so', 'stupid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'kids', 'movies', 'bad', 'name']",Max Keeble's Big Move

Amazingly there are FOUR writers credited here!

One that parents will be reluctant to suffer through with their kids. A shame considering it's directed by Tim Hill, whose previous film was MUPPETS FROM SPACE, which I consider to be THE best Muppet movie ever.
