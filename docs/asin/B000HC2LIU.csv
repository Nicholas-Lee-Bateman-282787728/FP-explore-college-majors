It is such a welcome change for Doris Roberts, who is usually associated with comedy. She is a consummate actress, as is Dana Delany (China Beach). This is not a downbeat story, but rather an affirmation of the power of love.

Doris Roberts as the mother with Alzheimer's is superb, she shows the pain and difficulty of coming to terms with such an illness.
