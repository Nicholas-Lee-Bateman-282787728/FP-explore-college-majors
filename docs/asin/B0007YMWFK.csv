895366,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0007YMWFK,A. Trotter,"[14, 20]","Ok, so rating anything that isn't out yet has got to be considered a little presumptious. But I can't help it - this show started it all for me, from childhood daydreams of my own log cabin in the mountains to trying to become a helocopter pilot in the Army to a somewhat more mature admiration for cello music today. Even if it's awful and cheesy when I see it again, it was a seed of a part of me that's still alive and strong today - dreams and ambitions that have endured. And for that it gets 5 stars.I'm not expecting much, mind you. I do remember the pilot episode quite clearly and if that's anything to go by, we're talking some pretty corny stuff. But the worst of the cliches are cliches purely because they strike such a chord in us. As children we're without walls and experience and we enjoy pure silly theater with a depth of passion that is harder and harder to come by as an adult; we become skeptical and mocking, forgetting how wonderful we found the mystery of a man who only wore white and was called Archangel.So, no matter how awful, I'll get it and watch it with great relish. This was the stuff of my dreams. Although even then I recognized that one re-used airborne explosion, over and over, as that was the limit of their effects budget. I'm not particularly looking foreward to that explosion ... years have passed and I still get sick of the mere thought of it today. Perhaps they were kind and did a little touch-up work, inserted some variations on that repetitive fireball? I doubt it.

895370,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,B0007YMWFK,David A. Bede,"[4, 4]","So, as a pre-teen in the '80s, did you dream of growing up to be an ace pilot/adventurer like Stringfellow and Dominic?  Me too.  Did it happen?  Me neither.  But ""Airwolf"" is just about as much fun now as it was then.Most of the plots in this collection have held up better than those of other shows of the same era.  Then again, maybe that's only because I recognized the implausibility of most of them the first time around as a 12-year old - but no matter!  Stringfellow Hawke is still the ultimate anti-hero, angry at the world and frosty with nearly everyone he meets, but willing to risk life, limb and treason to help his friends.  (And really, it's okay to be slightly amused at the fact that Jan Michael Vincent has since turned into the very sort of misanthrope he played here!)  Most of the stories have a great edge-of-the-world suspense to them, even if you know the outcome of the battle is a foregone conclusion once String gets into the helicopter.  And the series is now old enough to have a couple of unintentionally funny moments.  Most notable among these is the case of Hawke being duped into believing he's been in a coma for a year, thanks in part to a fake news show with an explosive scoop...Prince Charles and Princess Diana getting a divorce!  (I guess it really would have been explosive in 1984, after all.)And no, there are no extras.  But so what?

895371,AGCVPCMDY4Q2W,B0007YMWFK,David Harvey,"[1, 1]","This series was one of the best in its day!!!  Its too bad Jan-Michael Vincent decided to turn to alcohol so heavily, thus ending the series.  However, while it was here you had a great storyline with an exceptional cast.  Ernest Bornine plays a easy going character, Dominic Santini, who is the owner of Santini Air.  Dom is the only surviving family friend of Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent).  People will remember Ernest Borgnine from his earlier series, ""McHale's Navy"", and he brings that same great wit to this series.  Alex Cord plays Michael Colesmith-Briggs III codename Archangel, who is one of the higher-ups (executives) at the firm (CIA) that developed Airwolf along with its creator, Dr. Henry Moffet (David Hemmings).This show is a roller-coaster ride from the beginning, and Sylvester Levay's terrific score blends right into the show!!

895373,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,B0007YMWFK,Dumb Ox,"[7, 8]","To own this series on DVD has been a longtime dream of ours, ever since we belatedly discovered Airwolf running in syndication on USA Network.  The original Airwolf, not to be confused with the horrid clone USA tried to make to cash in on the first show, was one of the gems to emerge from the 80's and the mind of Donald P. Bellisario, who also gave us Magnum, PI and Murder, She Wrote.  Unlike those two more pleasant shows, Airwolf began as a dark and brooding mid-season replacement and shot skyward in the ratings.  It parlayed on the high-tech popularity of movies like Blue Thunder and Firefox, and featured good writing, a sound premise, passable special effects, a menacingly sleek and dangerous helicopter, and possibly the coolest theme music to come out of a television series.  To top it off, there was the cast comprised of three former movie stars:  Jan-Michael Vincent as brooding anti-hero and Viet Nam veteran Stringfellow Hawke, haunted by his past; the durable Ernest Borgnine as his old friend and mentor, Dominic Santini; and Alex Cord as the debonair and ambigiously loyal FIRM deputy director, Michael Coldsmith Briggs III, codenamed Archangel.  The final regular was lovely and intellectual Marella, Michael's assistant, played perfectly by Deborah Pratt.  Toss in the Cold War, espionage, high-tech suspense(with just a small dash of human interest elements), and the show started out of the gate an almost assured ratings winner.  The continuing thread for the series was that Hawke had stolen Airwolf back from its demented creator for Archangel but then refused to return it to the spy, instead using it as leverage to force Michael to use his resources to track down String's older MIA brother, St. John.  Archangel in turn has Hawke and Airwolf to run secret missions for him, sometimes without his agency's knowledge or consent.For the first half-season, Airwolf was fine, some episodes better than others, but none was disappointing; the pilot was awesomely done.  However, CBS interfered with Bellisario's dark vision for the show, changing out Marella for spunky Caitlin O'Shaugnessy(Jean Bruce Scott) and shifting the emphasis from espionage to so much human interest it was almost nauseating.  Fortunately, the third season turned the trend back around to some degree, but by then Bellisario was more or less gone, listed merely as ""Executive Producer"" in the credits.This DVD, then, is the best of the show.  All of the brooding darkness, the ambiguity especially regarding Archangel's loyalties, the crossfire between Santini and Archangel that was almost reminiscent of McCoy and Spock from classic Star Trek, the misery and sweetness of Hawke's character, everything that made this program so unique is at its best in this set of episodes.  Of this set, the pilot episode ""Shadow of the Hawke"" remains at the top in terms of quality:  five stars.In descending order are the others(at least in our opinion)Bite of the Jackal****1/2One Way Express****1/2Fight Like a Dove****And They Are Us****Echoes From the Past****Proof Through the Night****Mad Over Miami***1/2Mind of the Machine***1/2Daddy's Gone A-Hunting***Even the worst of this set is still pretty solid---better than the later seasons and vastly superior to the drek that USA tried to produce with a second-rate cast, mediocre writing and awful effects.  As die-hard fans of the original series, we will purchase more of these DVDs as they become available, but this first one is a great way for someone unfamiliar with Airwolf to see why it was such a great show.

This show has it all, intriguing storyline, awesome action, great characters, and the best darn original music I have ever heard.  Even to this day the music is still awesome.

I remember watching ""The Lady"" with my wonderful grandmother like it was yesterday, dreaming of going on adventures like my favorite super skilled pilot String-Fellow Hawke.

Absolutely phoning in the performances, story, effort, everything.  Nobody cared, nobody got out of their trailer without doing a whole 8-ball of blow.2. Actually a well-done episode.  Frequently something involving Borgnine who's a genuinely good actor.

That's right: when the acting is awkward or terrible, there's some really badass flying scenes that start out in a wooded area, jump to the desert, and then go over to mountains, you've found your sweet spot in the 80s where no amount of dreary Reagan-era reality can bring you down.

895378,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B0007YMWFK,Hound Dog,"[79, 82]","The DVD release of ""Airwolf: Season One"" will likely prove to be a mixed blessing for its fans.The Series and Its Premise:Airwolf's first season (eleven episodes from 1984) cleverly developed the series' dark (and sometimes heavy-handed) perspective on Cold War espionage in which the Libyans and Russians were portrayed as the scheming, black-hatted villains, while U.S. covert intelligence (known as ""the Firm"" in this series) was viewed as heroic, white-hatted cowboys, despite having its own ambiguous motives.Caught in the middle are brooding ace pilot & reluctant hero Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent) and his loyal co-pilot, Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine), who have hidden away the most awesome aerial assault weapon on earth: Airwolf.  The enigmatic fate of Hawke's long-lost brother, St. John, who disappeared years before in Vietnam, motivates Hawke to strike a thieves' bargain with the Firm's director, Archangel (Alex Cord): Hawke & Santini will keep Airwolf stashed and fly it on secret missions for Archangel until the Firm can conclusively prove St. John's fate.With this bold premise, and backed by Sylvester Levay's memorably techno-styled score, the series kicked off the first season with its best episode ever: the movie-length ""Shadow of the Hawke,"" featuring Hawke's fiery showdown with Airwolf's psychotic creator, Charles Henry Moffett (David Hemmings) in the Libyan desert.  Flashbacks to scenes from this particular episode would hauntingly reverberate throughout the series.Also featured in Season One are some relatively superb (if sometimes implausible) entries such as: ""Echoes of the Past,"" ""Mind of the Machine,"" ""And They Are Us,"" and ""To Snare a Wolf,"" in which Hawke must fly Airwolf through a B-52 bombing run to elude a renegade U.S. government operative intent on obtaining or destroying Airwolf at any cost.At the same time, some of the other episodes from Season One remain merely OK, if not forgettable. For instance, the second episode, ""Daddy's Gone a Huntin',"" comes to mind, as the intriguing idea of Hawke discovering a long-lost son from Vietnam is toyed with before being ultimately dropped. Further, due in part to an unconvincing make-up job, the young actor (Chad Allen) portraying Hawke's possible son was simply a ludicrous casting choice given the circumstances of the episode.Nonetheless, despite its occasional flaws, ""Airwolf"" was far more sophisicated and intelligently written than any other program in the action-adventure genre for that era.Disc 1 (Side A):1. ""Shadow of the Hawke"" (pilot episode): 5 *****2. ""Daddy's Gone a Huntin'"": 3 ***3. ""Bite of the Jackal"": 4 ****(Side B):4. ""Proof Through the Night"": 4 1/2 ****5.

""Mind of the Machine"": 4 1/2 ****11. ""To Snare a Wolf"": 4 1/2 ****Rating of Season One episodes: 4 1/2 **** (overall)The DVD Edition:Universal Studios, unfortunately, chose to pursue the absolute ""bare bones"" approach with this release by:1. With the exception of choosing from three standard languages, there are not any special features.  The DVD is completely devoid of cast and crew interviews, commentaries, documentaries, an Airwolf blueprint, or even a snazzy main menu screen.  Considering how deliberately ""techno"" this series was, the potential special features available could have been awesome.  Instead, this is a major disappointment.2. The episodes are not re-mastered, nor were the audio tracks noticeably upgraded. Very ordinary.3. The few promo photos inexplicably include cast pictures from the dreaded fourth season (without Vincent or Borgnine).Rating of DVD Packaging & Extras (overall): 1 *If you choose to purchase ""Airwolf: Season One,"" beware you are getting a half-season's worth of mostly terrific episodes (but little else).

895388,A1GWLM8VRAYWGO,B0007YMWFK,Love Firefly,"[1, 2]","I found a cure for the 12 or so minutes missing from the movie itself. The First Season DVD set has the Pilot for the series and everything that was missing from the Movie here is on that first disc. So I got my music back at the end of the program I have always immensely enjoyed even at the age of about 12. But now many years later I know I have a much greater appreciation for not only the music but the Series itself, the paintings, the scenery, the actors and actress's and all the work that went into making the series as enjoyable then as it is now.The reproduction is very well done. It plays well on both my Blue Ray player and my DVD player. I could not be happier. Everyone did a fantastic job on this and everyone should be congradulated and commended for all their hard work and efforts to bring back something so many of us enjoyed for a very long time. I can at least say Thank you so very much for releasing it so we can enjoy for a long time to come and at any time.

895389,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B0007YMWFK,Pamela Walters,"[1, 7]","I was really disappointed with this first season of the show. I found it really was hard to figure out what was going on with the storylines, and you really had to pay attention to what was being said in order to figure out what was going on. And I found the subject matter of the show was really hard to get into, and there was nothing relatable other than the fact that this woman who Hawke gets really attached to in the pilot episode dies. He seems really heartbroken about it, but then in episode 2 and so on, he just kind of forgets that it even happened. I would have found it more believable if they would have made it a recurring storyline, and maybe have flashbacks or something. But I found in season 1 they really didn't find their groove yet.Another thing that disappointed me was the lack of episodes. There was only 2 discs, which contained only 11 episodes. I find this a ripoff when they sell a season of a show which only has half the amount of episodes for the same price as a season that has a full 22 or more episodes. I paid about 44 bucks for each of them. For someone wanting to get into this show though, there is some decent episodes in this set, but most of them are snoozefests. What you really want to do is get past this season and get more into seasons 2-3. So in that sense I do recommend this set. There is some really good stunt work with the helicopter, even though to me the storyline lacks at times.I only give this set a 2 out of 5 stars.",2,Disappointed Big Time...,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,1476,"['was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'found', 'really', 'was', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'storylines', 'really', 'had', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'was', 'nothing', 'relatable', 'other', 'fact', 'woman', 'who', 'Hawke', 'really', 'attached', 'pilot', 'episode', 'really', 'heartbroken', 'then', 'episode', '2', 'so', 'just', 'kind', 'forgets', 'even', 'happened', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'more', 'believable', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'recurring', 'storyline', 'maybe', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'something', 'found', 'season', '1', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'groove', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'was', 'lack', 'episodes', 'was', 'only', '2', 'discs', 'contained', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'find', 'ripoff', 'when', 'sell', 'season', 'show', 'only', 'amount', 'episodes', 'same', 'price', 'season', 'full', '22', 'more', 'episodes', 'paid', 'about', '44', 'bucks', 'someone', 'wanting', 'get', 'show', 'decent', 'episodes', 'set', 'most', 'are', 'snoozefests', 'What', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'get', 'season', 'get', 'more', 'seasons', '2-3', 'So', 'sense', 'do', 'recommend', 'set', 'really', 'good', 'stunt', 'work', 'helicopter', 'even', 'storyline', 'times.I', 'only', 'give', 'set', '2', '5', 'stars']",Airwolf: Season One

895397,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B0007YMWFK,Taheen Lopez,"[3, 15]","I think the DVD of this abbreviated season of AIRWOLF is stupendous, but now that they have this complete 1st Season of Airwolf on DVD, I think they should plan on making a DVD of AIRWOLF's complete 2nd Season, which was Airwolf's 1984-85 Season on CBS, which should be even better than Airwolf-Season 1, because I think the Second Season of AIRWOLF was better & more upgraded than the First Season is.So now I cant wait to see Airwolf's complete 2nd Season and I cant wait till they make a DVD of AIRWOLF- Season 2, which should be even better, especially since the 2nd Season of AIRWOLF has a lot more episodes than the 1st Season does, plus the 2nd Season of AIRWOLF is also when co-pilot Caitlyn O'Shaunessy(Jean Bruce Scott) joins the cast of AIRWOLF too, but I personally think the 3rd Season of Airwolf is the best season of that show, not to mention that Airwolf's 3rd Season was my favorite season, which was the 1985-86 Season of Airwolf on CBS.It was also interesting seeing Shannon Doherty in the ""Bite Of The Jackal"" episode before she was even famous and before her days on OUR HOUSE, BEVERLY HILLS 90210, and CHARMED, which was of course before Shannen Doherty's reputation went sour after being fired from BEVERLY HILLS 90210.Therefore, you could say that seeing Shannon Doherty on AIRWOLF and watching her on OUR HOUSE were Shannen Doherty's better and more likeable days before her reputation and popularity was tarnished.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when AIRWOLF was in competition with BLUE THUNDER, except BLUE THUNDER didn't last unlike AIRWOLF, especially since AIRWOLF K.O.'d BLUE THUNDER in the ratings especially since AIRWOLF was a more upgraded Superchopper than BLUE THUNDER was as well.Therefore, AIRWOLF had some hefty competition going on with KNIGHT RIDER at the time as well, since there were so many advantages and disadvantages between AIRWOLF and the Knight 2000 as well as similarities in features, but KNIGHT RIDER still had better ratings than AIRWOLF did along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER lasted longer than AIRWOLF did too, since CBS had cancelled the old AIRWOLF around the same time NBC had cancelled KNIGHT RIDER back in 1986 since the premiere of STREET HAWK on ABC in the Winter of 1985 started giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend since ABC had STREET HAWK on Friday nights, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturday nights, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights which started giving viewers too much competition & redundancy especially since all 3 Universal high-tech dramas premiered too close after one another since KNIGHT RIDER premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF debuted on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK debuted on ABC in the Winter of 1985, but had only lasted 9 weeks.Therefore, STREET HAWK not only led to its own cancellation in the Spring of 1985, but had also ended up leading to the cancellation of AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER in the Spring of 1986 since people got bored & burned out with these futuristic high-tech shows since AIRWOLF was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & STREET HAWK making the special-effects a lot less impressive & a lot less convincing on top of that.It was also interesting seeing*Lance LeGault in the ""To Snare A Wolf"" episode during his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col.Decker) on THE A-TEAM*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Daddy's Gone A-Hunting"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's dorky fellow officer(Sgt.
