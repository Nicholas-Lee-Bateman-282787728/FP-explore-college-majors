1148239,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00151QYXA,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","The Take isn't a particularly groundbreaking or original film by any means- it's a fairly typical action/suspense with perhaps a tad more focus on the drama elements than other films of the genre.It's about a truck driver who accidentally gets caught up with a gunman looking to steal some money as part of a plan, and the bad guy needs the truck drivers help (against his will, of course) in order to pull off the crime successfully.Well when the events go horribly wrong and the truck driver ends up getting shot and put into the hospital, he eventually recovers and goes out searching for the guy who shot him.From there, a good portion of the storyline is devoted to the truck drivers new and unpredictable relationship with his family (particularly his wife) and of course the cops get involved and actually suspect the truck driver might be guilty of certain crimes himself.The acting is pretty good and believable, the action is really good at the beginning and end, and the drama segments in the middle are quite interesting as well.Some people find the middle of the film quite uninteresting and unsatisfactory, but I actually really enjoyed the truck drivers sudden change of attitude.  These scenes showed a man who was forced to become tougher and more aware of his surroundings because of a horrible life-changing incident.No real complaints with a mostly pretty solid movie.",4,action and suspense,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1388,"['Take', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'groundbreaking', 'original', 'film', 'means-', 'fairly', 'typical', 'action/suspense', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'more', 'focus', 'drama', 'elements', 'other', 'films', 'genre.It', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'accidentally', 'caught', 'up', 'gunman', 'looking', 'steal', 'money', 'part', 'plan', 'bad', 'guy', 'truck', 'drivers', 'help', 'will', 'course', 'order', 'pull', 'off', 'crime', 'successfully.Well', 'when', 'events', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'truck', 'driver', 'up', 'getting', 'shot', 'put', 'hospital', 'eventually', 'recovers', 'out', 'searching', 'guy', 'who', 'shot', 'him.From', 'there', 'good', 'portion', 'storyline', 'devoted', 'truck', 'new', 'unpredictable', 'relationship', 'family', 'particularly', 'wife', 'course', 'cops', 'get', 'involved', 'actually', 'suspect', 'truck', 'driver', 'might', 'be', 'guilty', 'certain', 'crimes', 'himself.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'believable', 'action', 'really', 'good', 'beginning', 'end', 'drama', 'segments', 'middle', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'well.Some', 'people', 'find', 'middle', 'film', 'quite', 'uninteresting', 'unsatisfactory', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'truck', 'drivers', 'sudden', 'change', 'attitude', 'scenes', 'showed', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'become', 'tougher', 'more', 'aware', 'surroundings', 'horrible', 'life-changing', 'incident.No', 'real', 'complaints', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'solid', 'movie']",The Take

1148243,A38TFB4MYXC2MC,B00151QYXA,"Ginger ALE ""Anne""","[0, 0]","This is not a standard ""actioner"" nor is it a straight drama but it tries to show a more realistic view of what happens AFTER someone is shot ....... it's not easy to watch & I'm sure real life results are even grimmer than they are portrayed in this move. But it is refreshing to see someone try to delineate in some small way the truth of such a life altering injury. Leguizamo is nicely understated as the victim and Rosie Perez is interesting as the patient wife-a quieter role than she often gets to inhabit. Gibson plays a despicable thug with style and a true sense of menace without conscience. You believe he will kill anyone who gets in his way & then think nothing of it. The FBI/cops are pretty standard issue but don;t detract from the movie. The pacing is uneven and the movie does drag sometimes but again I think the Director was trying to have us walk in real life shoes instead of just the macho vengeance mode that would have been so easy to slide into at the end of the movie. The guy just wants his life back and, in the end, he gets back the ""new"" version of what his life IS after surviving such a trauma.

This movie is a major snore fest. There is action at the beginning and at the end. The whole middle and story builder part of the movie is boring as can be. This is supposed to be a story of revenge, but by the time you actually get to the revenge you are fighting to keep your eyes open. Watching Leguizamo have mood swings for 40 minutes straight does not make for a good movie. Also the glue on beard that Tyrese wears in the movie looks utterly ridiculous (LOL).

I truly believe most can agree this is one of the best pieces of fiction best paralleling reality for L.A. filmed since (and including) Crash, Harsh Times, Training Day, etc.Watching the deleted scenes, docu on filming, listening to commentary, and related media, they all reveal a true sense of wanting to make a non-Hollywood film with succession and an honest feeling of REALITY. Reading thru several armored car inside-jobs this film reveals a very authentic feel that deserves more credit than it is being given.Outstanding performances by Cannavale, Perez and Gibson proving small films can bring the best out of someone.  Regardless of the negative and technical reviews written about the end scenes and cultural inaccuracies - I have to give this film one of the most realistic portrayals I have seen in years centering around a man that is losing everything that makes him a man - and finds a way to regain it without being Jason Bourne or James Bond.A worthwhile film that deserves a rent or maybe even a purchase for those from the areas of LA they film in...if anything - the sex scene is probably one of the most dedicated I have watched in some time - but at the same time shows a realism that mainstream cinema has missed for years...I will be recommending this title in my store for those looking for an authentic urban film.",4,Please enjoy an overlooked SOCAL title...,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,1518,"['depictions', 'descriptions', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'numerous', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'writs', 'seem', 'determined', 'discredit', 'good', 'film', 'truly', 'believe', 'most', 'can', 'agree', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'fiction', 'best', 'paralleling', 'reality', 'L.A.', 'filmed', 'including', 'Crash', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'Training', 'Day', 'etc.Watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'docu', 'filming', 'listening', 'commentary', 'related', 'media', 'reveal', 'true', 'sense', 'wanting', 'make', 'non-Hollywood', 'film', 'succession', 'honest', 'feeling', 'REALITY', 'Reading', 'thru', 'several', 'armored', 'car', 'inside-jobs', 'film', 'very', 'authentic', 'feel', 'more', 'credit', 'being', 'given.Outstanding', 'performances', 'Cannavale', 'Perez', 'Gibson', 'proving', 'small', 'films', 'can', 'bring', 'best', 'someone', 'Regardless', 'negative', 'technical', 'reviews', 'written', 'end', 'scenes', 'cultural', 'inaccuracies', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'centering', 'man', 'losing', 'everything', 'man', 'way', 'regain', 'being', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'James', 'Bond.A', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'rent', 'maybe', 'even', 'purchase', 'areas', 'LA', 'film', 'anything', 'sex', 'scene', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'dedicated', 'have', 'watched', 'time', 'same', 'time', 'realism', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'missed', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'recommending', 'title', 'store', 'looking', 'authentic', 'urban', 'film']",The Take
1148250,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B00151QYXA,The Jaundiced Eye,"[14, 16]","I rented this DVD without any prior knowledge of its content and was very, very impressed by the gritty realism of this independent movie.High points: The acting was superb. John Leguizamo, Rosie Perez, and Bobby Cannavale turn in what I believe are their finest performances on film. The supporting cast was flawless. John and Rosie, and the young actors that portray their children, present a painfully realistic portrait of a poor-but-happy family that is torn apart by the brain injury he receives and his inability to just ""turn the other cheek"".The plot is convincing at all times. Felix (Leguizamo's character) is framed for an inside-job robbery that is shockingly realistic in its violence. The FBI agent (Cannavale) behaves credibly, not as a cold-hearted, judgemental investigator (like his partner) but with a big dose of humanity and compassion. His instincts tell him that Felix is innocent, but the evidence (and his partner) increasingly speak to the contrary. He is an intelligent man; not a caricature. The fact that the same can be said about all the main characters is a significant plus for this production.The chase scene, a conformity in so many movies, that is often so drawn out, so redundant, so trite, and so boring, is completely different in this movie: it actually manages to be exciting and somewhat original. I particularly like the fact that at no time in the movie does Felix become a gun-savy, martial-arts-whiz vigilante, but is consistently portrayed as a regular guy who has been grievously injured and is angry about it. His actions and reactions are much like any average person in a really bad situation. Marina (Rosie's character) truly loves him and sticks by him until the relationship becomes too dangerous to tolerate. She never turns into a preaching shrew, but instead a very plausibly scared, hurt, loving woman.The ""sex scene"", while graphic, is so pertinent to the story and portrayed with such sensitivity and humanity that it rises above simple titillation to the level of ""art"", which is neither common nor easy to achieve. Most sex scenes are inserted into movies to give the audience some distraction and a chance to see attractive people naked....this one is not at all like that. In this scene, the viewer is more concerned with the painful reality of the encounter than with the visual images.I have heard it said that no movie is better than the quality of its villain. If this is true, that add one more plus to this production. Tyrese Gibson turns in a bone-chilling performance that is so realistic and intense that the viewer at no time doubts the danger and malice he represents. He is one bad dude, and Felix is in real trouble. You cease to feel that this is just a movie, and begin to genuinely fear for the ""good"" characters. This is villainy at its best.In conclusion, I strongly recommend this movie to all mature viewers who are ready for a change of pace from the common and mundane revenge movie. It is powerfully portrayed, beautifully acted, and plausible throughout.",5,Excellent Movie....Highest Recommendation !!!!,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,3043,"['rented', 'DVD', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'content', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'impressed', 'gritty', 'realism', 'independent', 'movie.High', 'points', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'turn', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'finest', 'performances', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'flawless', 'John', 'Rosie', 'young', 'actors', 'portray', 'children', 'present', 'painfully', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'poor-but-happy', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'brain', 'injury', 'inability', 'just', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', '.The', 'plot', 'convincing', 'times', 'Felix', 'Leguizamo', 'character', 'framed', 'inside-job', 'robbery', 'shockingly', 'realistic', 'violence', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Cannavale', 'credibly', 'not', 'cold-hearted', 'judgemental', 'investigator', 'partner', 'big', 'dose', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'instincts', 'tell', 'Felix', 'innocent', 'evidence', 'partner', 'increasingly', 'speak', 'contrary', 'intelligent', 'man', 'not', 'caricature', 'fact', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'main', 'characters', 'significant', 'plus', 'production.The', 'chase', 'scene', 'conformity', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'often', 'so', 'drawn', 'out', 'so', 'redundant', 'so', 'trite', 'so', 'boring', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'actually', 'be', 'exciting', 'somewhat', 'original', 'particularly', 'fact', 'time', 'movie', 'Felix', 'become', 'gun-savy', 'martial-arts-whiz', 'vigilante', 'consistently', 'portrayed', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'grievously', 'injured', 'angry', 'actions', 'reactions', 'are', 'much', 'average', 'person', 'really', 'bad', 'situation', 'Marina', 'Rosie', 'character', 'truly', 'sticks', 'relationship', 'too', 'dangerous', 'tolerate', 'never', 'preaching', 'shrew', 'instead', 'very', 'plausibly', 'scared', 'hurt', 'loving', 'woman.The', 'sex', 'scene', 'graphic', 'so', 'pertinent', 'story', 'portrayed', 'such', 'sensitivity', 'humanity', 'above', 'simple', 'titillation', 'level', 'art', 'common', 'easy', 'achieve', 'Most', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'inserted', 'movies', 'give', 'audience', 'distraction', 'chance', 'see', 'attractive', 'people', 'naked', '.this', 'one', 'not', 'scene', 'viewer', 'more', 'concerned', 'painful', 'reality', 'encounter', 'visual', 'images.I', 'have', 'heard', 'said', 'movie', 'better', 'quality', 'villain', 'true', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'plus', 'production', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'bone-chilling', 'performance', 'so', 'realistic', 'intense', 'viewer', 'time', 'danger', 'malice', 'one', 'bad', 'dude', 'Felix', 'real', 'trouble', 'cease', 'feel', 'just', 'movie', 'begin', 'genuinely', 'fear', 'good', 'characters', 'villainy', 'best.In', 'conclusion', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'mature', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'change', 'pace', 'common', 'mundane', 'revenge', 'movie', 'powerfully', 'portrayed', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'plausible']",The Take
