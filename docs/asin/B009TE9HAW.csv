You'll live.""Nurse Jackie"" was a hard-sell to begin with for me - I heard about the show and was mistrustful of the premise, actively avoiding it for a year or so. Finally, though, I hit a slow patch in my viewing schedule and tried out Season One, and was pleasantly surprised. I was never as into it as my wife, but the acerbic lead character played by Edie Falco reminded me of some tough, grumpy, magnetic people I've known in my life, and it was a compelling portrayal.So we followed it along from season to season and were psyched to see S4... Sadly, this season turned out to be a little bit of a dud. I liked them having Jackie straighten up and get off the pills - it actually makes her character more compelling, although I do think they could have kept her in rehab a bit longer... that angle had dramatic possibilities that so far seem unexplored... But overall, this season seemed pretty slack, and we felt deflated by the abrupt ending and the overall laxity of the season's arc. I don't think the creative team overdid anything or lost their way, the show just seems to have run out of steam.  It's possible Season Five will surprise me, and I'll certainly give it a shot, but as far as following the show forever, I'm definitely on the fence after S4.  Oh, well.

Look for the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (""One Day at a Time"") as a cussing octagernarian during this story arc. Testing Jackie's commitment to stay clean is the fact that there's trouble at work and not only is her marriage on the rocks but she's in danger of losing her kids.All Saints gains an ambitious but power-tripping new administrator/doctor (Bobby Cannavale) which bumps Gloria Akalitus back on the floor as just another nurse. O'Hara's preganancy figures largely this season but unfortunately this story arc makes the imbecilic Dr. Cooper (my least favorite character) even more annoying than usual--not to mention the fact for some reason Dr. Cooper is sporting more eyeliner than Alice Cooper all season long.There's some twists here and there but nothing too surprising.

She was sacrificing herself for her kids..Season 4 turned everything around. Plus her marriage ended. I miss the older jackie....Plus Zoey was better in the past as well. She was funnier... Shes still good. but better in the past. I liked the only Zoey unsure of herself who barely got along with JackieNow the 2 are living together and she is alot more sure of herself... like i said total 180.Plus Its depressing a little. Gloria and Eddie got fired. Jackie gets fired at the end.each episode is under 30 minutes long.. That didnt give us much screen time to get to know each of these characters before we turned the show UPSIDE DOWN!It was a very bad move on the creators/writers part.

The addition of Bobby Cavinalle as Dr Cruz really added Zest to this season and the back and forth and sparing between Edie Falco and Bobby Cavinalle is an Acting Fans Dream though it still doesnt compare to the team of Edie and the late James Gandolfini(but then again, what would?). Jackie's battle with sobriety and the consequences of her actions is the focus of the fourth season and her journey to finding herself makes for very compelling storytelling and the writers did a fine job with that! I also enjoyed the journey of all the other characters with each of them growing despite their own set of problems! I enjoyed every single episode of this season and I cannot wait for Season Five!
