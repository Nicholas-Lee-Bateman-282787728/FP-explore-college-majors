Like I said in my other review, I lusted after some of the younger ones on the show, but they are now grown and married. The energy, the lust and what ever else is no longer there. Also, like I said in my other review of Growing Pains: The Movie, they should have included ""Boner and Eddie"".",4,Growing Pains: Retun of the Seavers,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,375,"['movies', 'were', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'energy', 'TV', 'shows', 'said', 'other', 'review', 'lusted', 'younger', 'ones', 'show', 'are', 'now', 'grown', 'married', 'energy', 'lust', 'what', 'ever', 'else', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'Also', 'said', 'other', 'review', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Movie', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'Boner', 'Eddie']",Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers

1511047,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,B0066E6SSC,Bobby,"[10, 10]","Totally thrilled Warner Brothers was kind enough to release these films on dvd :)Growing Pains Return Of The Seavers is a really fun, made for tv film and fans of the series are sure to enjoy seeing the Seavers again.Is it as great as the series? Of course not. But it's 100 percent worth a buy and a must own to continue your Growing Pains dvd collection set. Nobody ever thought these would ever see a dvd release so it's a no brainer buy in my opinion.Don't let the word Dvd-R turn you away. It's just not sold in stores :) only here on Amazon and on the Warner Brothers site. That makes it even more of a must buy.One more thing fellow Growing Pains fans. We the fans are what keeps dvd's moving. We must support everything Growing Pains! Clearly the nice people at Warner Brothers are still at least interested in this series and if we continue to buy Growing Pains dvd's. Guess what? Maybe season 3 will be right around the corner.This classic sitcom sure deserves every season released.A fun movie.",5,Great fun for fans of the series,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,1005,"['Totally', 'thrilled', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'kind', 'enough', 'release', 'films', 'dvd', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Return', 'Seavers', 'really', 'fun', 'made', 'tv', 'film', 'fans', 'series', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Seavers', 'again.Is', 'as', 'great', 'series', 'course', 'not', '100', 'percent', 'worth', 'buy', 'must', 'own', 'continue', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'dvd', 'collection', 'set', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'dvd', 'release', 'brainer', 'buy', 'opinion.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'word', 'Dvd-R', 'turn', 'away', 'just', 'not', 'sold', 'stores', 'only', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'site', 'even', 'more', 'must', 'buy.One', 'more', 'thing', 'fellow', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'fans', 'fans', 'are', 'what', 'dvd', 'moving', 'must', 'support', 'everything', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Clearly', 'nice', 'people', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'are', 'still', 'least', 'interested', 'series', 'continue', 'buy', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'dvd', 'Guess', 'what', 'Maybe', 'season', '3', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'corner.This', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'sure', 'season', 'released.A', 'fun', 'movie']",Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers
