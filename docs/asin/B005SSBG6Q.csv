1502825,A57JWK56OUKLZ,B005SSBG6Q,Amber,"[2, 3]","This movie is powerful. It is not powerful because of the acting (which is so so at times), or because of a suspenseful plot. It is powerful because of its message. This film cuts through everything that can become so important in life and dares to ask the question, 'What would we do if we lost it all?' What if ... we couldn't rely on credit? What if ... the bad economy stripped us of our homes and dignity? What if we were forced to face our busy lives and saw that all our running and trying to achieve and impress had left us with harried relationships and kids we barely know?God calls us to something different. He calls the family unit to something more. With Him at the center, family second, and all else third, this movie shows the power in the Bible, faith, and and family as God intended.Highly recommend!",5,a movie that convicts,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,819,"['movie', 'powerful', 'not', 'powerful', 'acting', 'so', 'so', 'times', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'powerful', 'message', 'film', 'everything', 'can', 'become', 'so', 'important', 'life', 'dares', 'ask', 'question', 'would', 'do', 'lost', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'rely', 'credit', 'What', 'bad', 'economy', 'stripped', 'homes', 'dignity', 'What', 'were', 'forced', 'face', 'busy', 'lives', 'saw', 'running', 'trying', 'achieve', 'impress', 'had', 'left', 'harried', 'relationships', 'kids', 'barely', 'know', 'God', 'something', 'different', 'family', 'unit', 'something', 'more', 'Him', 'center', 'family', 'second', 'else', 'third', 'movie', 'power', 'Bible', 'faith', 'family', 'God', 'intended.Highly', 'recommend']",Stand Strong

My 12 year old liked it so much, when I asked her what she wanted for her birthday in November, this was the only thing she thought of right off the bat. It is about a well to do family who winds up having to live in a relative's home after going broke. They realize what is really important through the process. The acting is not A+ Hollywood, but if Hollywood actually put out quality stories like these with A+ actors no one would have to make these independent ones. Sadly they don't.

The film portrayed so accurately the state of this country and the excesses by which we think we need to live.  All we need to do is look around our neighborhoods and we see foreclosed homes because people were trying to live out the dream and the truth is, the &#34;dream&#34; is not tangible goods, it's allowing Jesus to lead the way and teach you what is important.  The attitude of entitlement of each one is way too real.  But it was also very real in watching the transformation in each one as they began to see what life was truly about.  They became a real family and showed hope to those who may have fallen into the same financial trap.
