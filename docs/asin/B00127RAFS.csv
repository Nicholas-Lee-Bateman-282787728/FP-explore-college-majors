With any show, you can pretty much expect it to decline with time. However, season seven was a big disappointment for me. It really lacked originality and the fun factor seemed to be lost in every episode. But, season eight semi-redeems itself. I actually found season eight to be funnier than season seven. Of course the magic of the earlier seasons is completely gone, but this show is a classic nonetheless. Add this to your collection & i cant wait for the final 11th season to debut on DVD.",4,Better Than Season 7 in My Opinion,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,601,"['Seasons', '1', '6', 'were', 'totally', 'classic', 'point', 'Nothing', 'will', 'compare', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'show', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'expect', 'decline', 'time', 'However', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'really', 'lacked', 'originality', 'fun', 'factor', 'seemed', 'be', 'lost', 'episode', 'season', 'eight', 'semi-redeems', 'actually', 'found', 'season', 'eight', 'be', 'funnier', 'season', 'seven', 'course', 'magic', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'completely', 'gone', 'show', 'classic', 'nonetheless', 'Add', 'collection', 'i', 'cant', 'wait', 'final', '11th', 'season', 'debut', 'DVD']",Married... with Children: Season 8
1135527,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00127RAFS,andy8047,"[7, 9]","The eighth hilarious season of Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN introduces viewers to the all-male No Ma'am Club founded by Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) and Jefferson D'Arcy(Happy Days alum Ted McGinley). The club members are either bachelors or husbands who are disgusted by their wives' demeanors/lifestyles. Afterall,Al doesn't often enjoy the company of his 22-year wife Peggy(Katey Sagal). In Jefferson's case,he's still madly in love with his wife,the former Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse). I'm assuming that Jefferson co-founded the club primarily to give Al moral support. At every meeting,the members wear white T-shirts bearing the No Ma'am logo,which consists of the female symbol,encircled with a diagonal line over the symbol. But sometimes,Jefferson would enjoy the absence of his wife,but not as much as Al! Kelly(Christina Applegate),daughter of Al and Peggy,is still working as a roller-skating waitress which she began doing last season. Kelly's 19-year-old brother Bud(David Faustino),after a brief course in driving school instruction(degree required),takes a job at the DMV(Division of Motor Vehicles) as an instructor. I'll state for the record that Bud received his driver's license during season 5. I'm sure with Bud as an instructor,no one fails a driver's test! Jefferson still works as a waiter at a topless bar,which he began doing last season. As for the opening montage,there's still an instrumental theme similar to the late Frank Sinatra's 1955 hit recording LOVE & MARRIAGE. Reportedly,Sinatra's beneficiaries still refuse to let Sony Pictures continue using L&M. Many reviewers have commented on this,saying Sinatra's family is greedy which I don't believe is true. Possibly,the families of L&M's writers,Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen,are forbidding the continued use of the song. Well,the families refuse for their own reasons. The similarity is heard in the closing montage also. I guess we can say that the Bundys were still Kings of the Fox network during 1993-94. The animated SIMPSONS drew high ratings in its fifth season then also.",5,The inauguration of the all-male No Ma'am Club,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,2062,"['eighth', 'hilarious', 'season', 'Fox', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'viewers', 'all-male', 'No', ""Ma'am"", 'Club', 'founded', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Jefferson', ""D'Arcy"", 'Happy', 'Days', 'alum', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'club', 'members', 'are', 'either', 'bachelors', 'husbands', 'who', 'are', 'disgusted', 'wives', 'demeanors/lifestyles', 'Afterall', 'Al', ""n't"", 'often', 'enjoy', 'company', '22-year', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'Jefferson', 'case', 'still', 'madly', 'love', 'wife', 'former', 'Marcy', 'Rhoades', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Jefferson', 'co-founded', 'club', 'primarily', 'give', 'Al', 'moral', 'support', 'meeting', 'members', 'wear', 'white', 'T-shirts', 'bearing', 'No', ""Ma'am"", 'logo', 'female', 'symbol', 'encircled', 'diagonal', 'line', 'symbol', 'sometimes', 'Jefferson', 'would', 'enjoy', 'absence', 'wife', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Al', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'daughter', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'still', 'working', 'roller-skating', 'waitress', 'began', 'doing', 'last', 'season', 'Kelly', '19-year-old', 'brother', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'brief', 'course', 'driving', 'school', 'instruction', 'degree', 'required', 'job', 'DMV', 'Division', 'Motor', 'Vehicles', 'instructor', ""'ll"", 'state', 'record', 'Bud', 'received', 'driver', 'license', 'season', '5', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Bud', 'instructor', 'one', 'driver', 'test', 'Jefferson', 'still', 'waiter', 'topless', 'bar', 'began', 'doing', 'last', 'season', 'opening', 'montage', 'still', 'instrumental', 'theme', 'similar', 'late', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', '1955', 'hit', 'recording', 'LOVE', 'MARRIAGE', 'Reportedly', 'Sinatra', 'beneficiaries', 'still', 'refuse', 'let', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'continue', 'using', 'L', 'M', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'saying', 'Sinatra', 'family', 'greedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'Possibly', 'families', 'L', 'M', 'writers', 'Sammy', 'Cahn', 'Jimmy', 'Van', 'Heusen', 'are', 'forbidding', 'continued', 'use', 'song', 'Well', 'families', 'refuse', 'own', 'reasons', 'similarity', 'heard', 'closing', 'montage', 'also', 'guess', 'can', 'say', 'Bundys', 'were', 'still', 'Kings', 'Fox', 'network', '1993-94', 'animated', 'SIMPSONS', 'drew', 'high', 'ratings', 'fifth', 'season', 'then', 'also']",Married... with Children: Season 8

1135529,A2M2TAFFVHUAX7,B00127RAFS,A. Ortgiesen,"[1, 1]","Married with Children is a great show overall. The very best episodes, I would have to say are the early ones with Steve (Seasons 1-3). Ed O'Neill (Al) and David Garrison (Steve) had great interaction and played well off one and another. Build A Better Mousetrap, and Her Cups Runneth Over, for example, are two of my all time favorite episodes. That being said, each season had their share of shining episodes including this one. No Ma'am, How green was my apple...etc. Enough about the show itself, What I am most disappointed in is the quality of the release. There are no special features other than some ""Minisodes"" of Silver Spoons and V.I.P. -- How they are related to Married With Children? I don't know. There is no commentary (I myself don't listen to the commentary, but some people do none the less), Heck in this release they cut down the packaging also! No booklet with the seasons' episode listing in it, just two slimline dvd cases. One case with two dvd's in it, and the other with the third disk in it. All in all you would get similar quality to recording re-runs on your DVD recorder (If you've got this, you've pretty much got what's here), and printing an episode guide from Tv.com. All that being said, I'm glad for the simple fact that it is being released. That's more than can be said for alot of other shows I.E. Night Court...

1135531,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B00127RAFS,EPA316,"[5, 6]","People are complaining that this season is getting cartoonish.. Is that supposed to be a bad thing?? This show was never meant to be Shakespeare. If this show had to evolve and change, it's at least in an entertaining way. This season we have No Ma'am, more episodes of Psycho Dad, more trips to the nudie bar, Big 'Uns magazine, more 'chicken' jabs at Marcy, and Al even gets to re-live football glory filling in (secretly) for an injured college player. I think the cartoonishness, including the falling stunt dummies, is hilarious. Some highlights include when Al carpools with fat women, the Village People show up and sing YMCA and get mugged by killer housewives, Al gets circumcised by accident, Kelly's boyfriend burns Peg's couch, Al has a chance at a free Dodge Viper, and Kelly's job as The Verminator results in Bud growing boobs. Yes, the plots are definitely getting more insane and cartoonish, but so what? How boring would No Ma'am be if all they did is sit around Al's house? If you want a tame, grounded-in-reality show, when has Married With Children ever been the answer? That's the direction the show was headed in anyway, and it makes it all the more entertaining. Al Bundy's facial expressions, lessons of wisdom, and ""a fat woman Godzilla'd into the shoe store"" stories are absolutely priceless. You can't listen to his lines and not laugh, such as ""so when a fat woman thunders in, a pie wedged under each chin, I'm not supposed to ask if that's the star spangled banner she's belching, so I know whether to stand up or sit down?"" That was when he was protesting political correctness.In the next few seasons, Al will settle on Griff as a second sidekick and co-worker at the shoe store, No Ma'am will be in for more adventures, and Al & Marcy will continue to tangle.

""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al starts an organization called NO MA'AM (National Organization of Men against Amazonian Masterhood) to protest against women taking over his favorite hangouts. Peggy (Katey Segal) is chosen for a $10,000 free throw contest in an all-star basketball game. Bud (David Faustino) finds a long-lost Valentine's card and goes on a desperate mission to find his lost love. Kelly (Christina Applegate) accidentally destroys her mother's favorite couch. An argument over an apple tree leads to a terrible no-holds-barred feud between the Bundy's and the Darcy's (Amanda Bearse & Ted McGinley). The eighth season of ""Married... with Children"" features some very funny moments and special appearances by Jerry Springer, Gary Coleman, Danny Bonaduce, Stacy Ferguson, Joe Namath and the Village People.If you already have purchased the previous DVD releases of the long-running comedy series then feel free to check out ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"". All 26 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 3-disc set contains a decent picture quality that is somewhat better than your average television rebroadcast. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound isn't outstanding but still acceptable. The 3-disc set includes two 3-minute mini-episodes of ""V.I.P."" and ""Silver Spoons"" and previews of other upcoming DVD releases. Overall, ""Married... with Children: The Complete Eighth Season"" offers the same weak extras and simple video/audio quality of previous box sets and receives a ""B-"".",4,Putting the Fun in Dysfunctional,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,1909,"['wild', 'misadventures', 'America', 'most', 'outrageous', 'family', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'Married', 'Children', 'long-running', 'FOX', 'sitcom', 'changed', 'view', 'typical', 'family', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'series', 'lives', 'luckless', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'bothersome', 'next-door', 'neighbors', 'season', 'Al', 'organization', 'called', 'NO', ""MA'AM"", 'National', 'Organization', 'Men', 'Amazonian', 'Masterhood', 'protest', 'women', 'taking', 'favorite', 'hangouts', 'Peggy', 'Katey', 'Segal', 'chosen', '10,000', 'free', 'throw', 'contest', 'all-star', 'basketball', 'game', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'long-lost', 'Valentine', 'card', 'desperate', 'mission', 'find', 'lost', 'love', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'accidentally', 'mother', 'favorite', 'couch', 'argument', 'apple', 'tree', 'terrible', 'no-holds-barred', 'feud', 'Bundy', 'Darcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'eighth', 'season', 'Married', 'Children', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'special', 'appearances', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'Stacy', 'Ferguson', 'Joe', 'Namath', 'Village', 'People.If', 'already', 'have', 'purchased', 'previous', 'DVD', 'releases', 'long-running', 'comedy', 'series', 'then', 'feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Eighth', 'Season', '26', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'format', '3-disc', 'set', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'somewhat', 'better', 'average', 'television', 'rebroadcast', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'still', 'acceptable', '3-disc', 'set', 'two', '3-minute', 'mini-episodes', 'V.I.P', 'Silver', 'Spoons', 'previews', 'other', 'upcoming', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Overall', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'same', 'weak', 'extras', 'simple', 'video/audio', 'quality', 'previous', 'box', 'sets', 'B-']",Married... with Children: Season 8
