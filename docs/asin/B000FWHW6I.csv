It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there!",5,"As always, we love everything Arthur!",1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,449,"['caught', 'movie', 'PBS', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'daughter', 'was', 'hooked', 'change', 'regular', 'Arthur', 'animation', 'one', 'computer', 'animated', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'fact', 'then', 'story', 'puppy', 'well', 'go', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'little', 'scary', 'times', 'when', 'guard', 'dogs', 'are', 'chasing', 'Pal', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'as', 'well', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'Arthur', 'fan', 'there']",Arthur's Missing Pal

997058,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B000FWHW6I,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[6, 9]","Follow the clues with Arthur on an exciting trail to find his missing dog Pal in this first-ever movie, featuring all new CGI animation. You'll join Arthur and his whole crew of best friends, including Buster Baxter, Binky Barns, Francine, Brain and Muffy. Arthur's parents and sister, D.W., also figure prominently in this DVD. Buster dusts off his hold detective gear in order to solve the case--so get ready to uncover the secrets of Arthur's missing dog!From an adult standpoint, the Arthur series on PBS is clever and downright hilarious. I can't tell you how many times my husband and I have caught ourselves sitting down watching this show!When my son saw Arthur's Missing Pal advertised on PBS, he of course wanted the DVD when it came out.I bought it for him and he watched it a few times--but then he hasn't brought it out again. (To be fair, he goes through seasons with his DVD's--often watching ""old favorites"" out of the blue...)I watched Arthur's Missing Pal with my son, and it was weird; it didn't ""feel"" like the animated show and it lacked the cleverness I've come to expect from this series. Even the ""dream"" sequences seemed uninspired. The CGI was so-so, with something being lost in the translation from animation to computer rendering. Although I recognized everyone, it didn't seem like the gang as envisioned by Marc Brown!Fans of Arthur will probably enjoy this DVD, but I can't help but feel the animated DVDs/videos are a lot better (but this is from an adult point of view, of course.) I don't think Arthur's Missing Pal is worth more than $10; in my opinion, parents/adults are better off ordering animated Arthur DVDs which often include 3 or more episodes. (The Boy With His Head in the Clouds is a recent favorite of my son, as is Arthur's Perfect Christmas, Arthur's Double Dare and Aruthur's Celebration.)",3,A Bit Odd,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1841,"['clues', 'Arthur', 'exciting', 'trail', 'find', 'missing', 'dog', 'Pal', 'first-ever', 'movie', 'featuring', 'new', 'CGI', 'animation', ""'ll"", 'join', 'Arthur', 'whole', 'crew', 'best', 'friends', 'including', 'Buster', 'Baxter', 'Binky', 'Barns', 'Francine', 'Brain', 'Muffy', 'Arthur', 'parents', 'sister', 'D.W.', 'also', 'figure', 'prominently', 'DVD', 'Buster', 'hold', 'detective', 'gear', 'order', 'solve', 'case', 'so', 'get', 'ready', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'Arthur', 'missing', 'dog', 'adult', 'standpoint', 'Arthur', 'series', 'PBS', 'clever', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'husband', 'have', 'caught', 'ourselves', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching', 'show', 'When', 'son', 'saw', 'Arthur', 'Missing', 'Pal', 'advertised', 'PBS', 'course', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', 'out.I', 'bought', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'then', ""n't"", 'brought', 'out', 'again', 'be', 'fair', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'often', 'watching', 'old', 'favorites', 'blue', 'watched', 'Arthur', 'Missing', 'Pal', 'son', 'was', 'weird', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'animated', 'show', 'lacked', 'cleverness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'series', 'Even', 'dream', 'sequences', 'seemed', 'uninspired', 'CGI', 'was', 'so-so', 'something', 'being', 'lost', 'translation', 'animation', 'computer', 'rendering', 'recognized', 'everyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gang', 'envisioned', 'Marc', 'Brown', 'Fans', 'Arthur', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'animated', 'DVDs/videos', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'adult', 'point', 'view', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Arthur', 'Missing', 'Pal', 'more', '10', 'opinion', 'parents/adults', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'ordering', 'animated', 'Arthur', 'DVDs', 'often', 'include', '3', 'more', 'episodes', 'Boy', 'Head', 'Clouds', 'recent', 'favorite', 'son', 'Arthur', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'Arthur', 'Double', 'Dare', 'Aruthur', 'Celebration']",Arthur's Missing Pal
997059,A11LBH38IDQNXN,B000FWHW6I,Jean M.,"[0, 0]","I had such hope with this movie.  I love Arthur.  I grew up watching the show and I still watch it to this day as an adult.  I was really happy to hear that Arthur will make a jump from 2D animation to CGI animation with this new movie.  Although it was nice to see the new look, the movie itself is an insult to Arthur fans.This movie is the perfect example of what Arthur looks like in the wrong hands.  The TV show is filled with a lot of heart and a lot of humor.  It's one of those rare shows that adults and kids can enjoy.  That magic is completely gone from this movie.  This movie is not funny at all and it completely misses the mark.The weird thing about this movie is that they bring back the same actors who play Arthur's Mom, Arthur's Dad/Binky (they're played by the same guy) and Buster from the TV show, but the rest of the characters are voiced by completely different people.  I couldn't understand this.  Muffy and Francine have been voiced by the same actresses for the past 16 years, yet they couldn't be in the movie?  What makes Arthur so great is how much personality the characters have, but in this movie, the characters have little to no personality at all.  The performances of the new voice actors don't capture their character at all and just come across and annoying and whiny.Let's not forget to mention that there was already an Arthur episode in the past about Pal running away and this movie reuses the same plot. I couldn't really care less about Pal running away and Arthur spending the entire movie trying to save him.  It becomes very tedious to watch, especially since the movie has no substance and it's already been done before, just in a different way.I know this is a kids movie, but they should have at least done Arthur some justice.  The only people that I could see liking this movie would be children 6 and under.  Anyone over that age will most likely find the movie boring and uninspiring.  Arthur fans should definitely avoid it because it doesn't capture the essence of the show whatsoever and everything about it is way too childish.",1,An Insult to Arthur Fans,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,2088,"['had', 'such', 'hope', 'movie', 'love', 'Arthur', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'still', 'watch', 'day', 'adult', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'hear', 'Arthur', 'will', 'make', 'jump', '2D', 'animation', 'CGI', 'animation', 'new', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'new', 'look', 'movie', 'insult', 'Arthur', 'fans.This', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'Arthur', 'wrong', 'hands', 'TV', 'show', 'filled', 'lot', 'heart', 'lot', 'humor', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'adults', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'magic', 'completely', 'gone', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'funny', 'completely', 'mark.The', 'weird', 'thing', 'movie', 'bring', 'back', 'same', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Mom', 'Arthur', 'Dad/Binky', ""'re"", 'played', 'same', 'guy', 'Buster', 'TV', 'show', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'voiced', 'completely', 'different', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Muffy', 'Francine', 'have', 'been', 'voiced', 'same', 'actresses', 'past', '16', 'years', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'What', 'Arthur', 'so', 'great', 'how', 'much', 'personality', 'characters', 'have', 'movie', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'personality', 'performances', 'new', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'capture', 'character', 'just', 'come', 'annoying', 'whiny.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'was', 'already', 'Arthur', 'episode', 'past', 'Pal', 'running', 'away', 'movie', 'same', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'less', 'Pal', 'running', 'away', 'Arthur', 'spending', 'entire', 'movie', 'trying', 'save', 'very', 'tedious', 'watch', 'especially', 'movie', 'substance', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'just', 'different', 'way.I', 'know', 'kids', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'done', 'Arthur', 'justice', 'only', 'people', 'could', 'see', 'liking', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'children', '6', 'Anyone', 'age', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'movie', 'boring', 'uninspiring', 'Arthur', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'avoid', ""n't"", 'capture', 'essence', 'show', 'whatsoever', 'everything', 'way', 'too', 'childish']",Arthur's Missing Pal
997060,A306153FTKS9PL,B000FWHW6I,Turtle502,"[0, 0]","This movie manages to bring together all the great things everybody enjoys about the ""Arthur"" series.  There are nods to DW's obsession with ""Mary Moo Cow"", Buster's annoying quirks, and Arthur's ""Charlie Brown"" personality.  Pure and simple, this is ""Arthur"".  If you typically enjoy watching the ""Arthur"" cartoon series with your children, you can probably manage to enjoy this movie.Although the voice-acting is as superb as it is in the original animated series, the animation in this film is quite different.  This film is computer animated.  Although I typically enjoy computer-animated films, the animation in this film is somewhat sub-standard.  It is very similar to the children's series ""Backyardigans"".  It is a 3-D environment, but things move very slowly, are not highly detailed, and in general appear very much like a ""video game"".  It might be interesting seeing Arthur's world in 3D animation, but it detracts slightly from the original feel of the series.  For fans of the original series, it will take some time adjusting to this.  The characters don't have that ""fluffy"" quality -- they appear to be plastic.Putting that point aside, this movie is a good family movie. It is short enough for short attention spans, and short enough so as not to bore parents to tears.  The story is enjoyable, and you won't regret watching it a few times with your children.",3,"Entertaining for families, but animation is weak",1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,1378,"['movie', 'bring', 'together', 'great', 'things', 'everybody', 'Arthur', 'series', 'are', 'nods', 'DW', 'obsession', 'Mary', 'Moo', 'Cow', 'Buster', 'annoying', 'quirks', 'Arthur', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'personality', 'Pure', 'simple', 'Arthur', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Arthur', 'cartoon', 'series', 'children', 'can', 'probably', 'manage', 'enjoy', 'voice-acting', 'as', 'superb', 'original', 'animated', 'series', 'animation', 'film', 'quite', 'different', 'film', 'computer', 'animated', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'animation', 'film', 'somewhat', 'sub-standard', 'very', 'similar', 'children', 'series', 'Backyardigans', '3-D', 'environment', 'things', 'move', 'very', 'slowly', 'are', 'not', 'highly', 'detailed', 'general', 'appear', 'very', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Arthur', 'world', '3D', 'animation', 'slightly', 'original', 'feel', 'series', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'adjusting', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fluffy', 'quality', 'appear', 'be', 'plastic.Putting', 'point', 'aside', 'movie', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'short', 'enough', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'short', 'enough', 'so', 'not', 'bore', 'parents', 'tears', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'children']",Arthur's Missing Pal
