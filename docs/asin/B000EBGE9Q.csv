971353,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000EBGE9Q,calvinnme,"[21, 23]","Dr. Katz is a comedic cartoon with stand-up comedian Jonathan Katz in the starring role of a psychiatrist who has more than his share of professional comedians as patients. This enables them to do their stand-up comedy routines as part of their therapy sessions. Dr Katz' 23 year old son, Ben, still lives with the good doctor and is chronically unemployed. Ben is constantly trying to start up a romance with Dr. Katz' receptionist, Laura, with no luck whatsoever. For example, when Ben meets Laura for the first time he asks her if she'd like to go out for coffee, and she does - leaving him to answer the phones. Laura receives a paycheck from Dr. Katz but in many ways is as chronically unemployed as Ben is. She has no interest in pretending to be busy, being nice to the patients, or at times, even showing up for work. For example, when Dr. Katz suggests that Laura to be nicer to the patients she replies ""Do you have any idea what it's like to deal with crazy people all day?"" In the series premiere, ""Pot-Bellied Pigs"", Dr. Katz rides Ben pretty hard about being out of work. Ben's solution to his cash flow problem is to buy two Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs and breed them in their small New York City apartment. When Dr. Katz asks Ben if he thinks this is a good plan Ben's response is ""Dad, the ad says 'Stay Home, Make Money' ....these are good things!"" The third episode ""Bully"" is also one of my favorites in which Ben gets very upset when Dr. Katz throws away Bully, the stuffed bull from his childhood. Ben labels everything that belongs to him, and expresses fear that perhaps his father wants him out, too.Dr Katz employs a novel animation technique called Squigglevision, which can be visually annoying to some people. In SquiggleVision there is virtually no lateral movement by any of the characters or objects, with only lips, eyes, and the like animated. However, the edges of the characters are in a constant state of zigzagging flux, and this gives the impression of movement. There are only six episodes in this first season, but the DVD set is reasonably priced considering the season's short duration. I highly recommend this unique comedy as one of the smartest and funniest offerings that Comedy Central came up with before they started trying to appeal to the least common denominator with stuff like ""The Man Show"".",5,Funniest show to come out of Comedy Central pre-South Park,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2347,"['Dr.', 'Katz', 'comedic', 'cartoon', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'Jonathan', 'Katz', 'starring', 'role', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'more', 'share', 'professional', 'comedians', 'patients', 'do', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'routines', 'part', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Dr', 'Katz', '23', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Ben', 'still', 'good', 'doctor', 'chronically', 'unemployed', 'Ben', 'constantly', 'trying', 'start', 'up', 'romance', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'receptionist', 'Laura', 'luck', 'whatsoever', 'example', 'when', 'Ben', 'Laura', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'out', 'coffee', 'leaving', 'answer', 'phones', 'Laura', 'paycheck', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'many', 'ways', 'chronically', 'unemployed', 'Ben', 'interest', 'pretending', 'be', 'busy', 'being', 'nice', 'patients', 'times', 'even', 'showing', 'up', 'work', 'example', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Laura', 'be', 'nicer', 'patients', 'Do', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'deal', 'crazy', 'people', 'day', 'series', 'premiere', 'Pot-Bellied', 'Pigs', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Ben', 'pretty', 'hard', 'being', 'work', 'Ben', 'solution', 'cash', 'flow', 'problem', 'buy', 'two', 'Vietnamese', 'pot-bellied', 'pigs', 'breed', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Ben', 'good', 'plan', 'Ben', 'response', 'Dad', 'ad', ""'Stay"", 'Home', 'Make', 'Money', '.these', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'third', 'episode', 'Bully', 'also', 'one', 'favorites', 'Ben', 'very', 'upset', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'away', 'Bully', 'stuffed', 'bull', 'childhood', 'Ben', 'labels', 'everything', 'expresses', 'fear', 'perhaps', 'father', 'out', 'too.Dr', 'Katz', 'novel', 'animation', 'technique', 'called', 'Squigglevision', 'can', 'be', 'visually', 'annoying', 'people', 'SquiggleVision', 'virtually', 'lateral', 'movement', 'characters', 'objects', 'only', 'lips', 'eyes', 'like', 'animated', 'However', 'edges', 'characters', 'are', 'constant', 'state', 'zigzagging', 'flux', 'impression', 'movement', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'considering', 'season', 'short', 'duration', 'highly', 'recommend', 'unique', 'comedy', 'one', 'smartest', 'funniest', 'offerings', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'came', 'up', 'started', 'trying', 'appeal', 'least', 'common', 'denominator', 'stuff', 'Man', 'Show']","Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist - Season 1"

My only quibble with this dvd is that the shows, are presented in a wider screen format than full frame (perhaps the originally broadcasts were chopped off at the sides?), however the dvd presents them letterboxed, which means if you have a 16x9 screen, close to half the screen is taken up by the letterboxing & the image is much smaller than it needs to be.",4,One of the smartest cartoons of the 90s,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,467,"['am', 'glad', 'see', 'show', 'finally', 'make', 'dvd', 'Definitely', 'best', 'cartoon', 'appear', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'only', 'quibble', 'dvd', 'shows', 'are', 'presented', 'wider', 'screen', 'format', 'full', 'frame', 'perhaps', 'originally', 'broadcasts', 'were', 'chopped', 'off', 'sides', 'however', 'dvd', 'letterboxed', 'have', '16x9', 'screen', 'close', 'screen', 'taken', 'up', 'letterboxing', 'image', 'much', 'smaller', 'be']","Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist - Season 1"

Dr. Katz, stunningly to me, is up there with the most endearing television programs ever created, due mostly to the individual characters of Katz and his son, and the two's relationship. The best bits in the season generally come from spontaneous dialogue amidst the two, usually with an underscore of either 1) Nothing or 2) Ben and his inability to... do anything. The clients and their therapy sessions with Katz aren't too funny this season I'm afraid, and surely my least favorite (who coincidentally became the most reoccurring guest on the show) is the now famous Ray Ramano.Every show finds their niche with time and my most treasured are often (especially in hindsight) a bit painful to watch. The first season here of Katz is still totally worthwhile because it establishes the main characters and setups, but it lacks on the laughs, especially in comparison to the following seasons of the show, which I hope hope hope are coming out SOON. Indispensable for admiring fans of the show, like my true self, but gut-busting entertainment this is not.

971357,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000EBGE9Q,Robert I. Hedges,"[6, 6]","Dave Attell called ""Dr. Katz"" a ""comedic garbage dump of material."" He's right, but only in the sense that this show dwells on the humorous and dark personality quirks of celebrities including (in the six episodes of season one) Ray Romano, Dave Attell, Dom Irrera, and Larry Miller. The psychoses of the ""cast"" are fleshed out in hilarious, yet dry, detail. Romano and Miller are my favorite patients from this season, but all the patients are strange, demented, and delightful. One of my favorite features of the show is the inset or flashbacks of the issue being discussed on the couch, the visual images of which are generally hilariously disturbing.I am also fond of the fact that Katz and his son, Ben (a 23 year old slacker) have as many (if not more) issues than the patients. One of my favorite recurring plotlines is Ben's attempt to get Katz's receptionist to date him, which only works when there is great opportunity for embarrassment for her boss at an ""open mic"" night. (I also particularly enjoy her creative hostility when she helps Ben park and subsequently get towed from a no parking zone.)This show (which really was made in Tom Snyder's pantry) is very dry and full of a bizarre mix of subtlety and snideness and is a true wonder of low budget animation. It not only introduced the world to the delights of Squigglevision (which propagated to the first season of ""Home Movies"") but made cartoons acceptable for adults again after years of focus on kids.This is a great, funny, intelligent, and surreal animation experience and I recommend it highly.",5,The Only Television Show Made In Tom Snyder's Pantry,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1571,"['Dave', 'Attell', 'called', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'comedic', 'garbage', 'dump', 'material', 'right', 'only', 'sense', 'show', 'humorous', 'dark', 'personality', 'quirks', 'celebrities', 'including', 'six', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'Dom', 'Irrera', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'psychoses', 'cast', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'dry', 'detail', 'Romano', 'Miller', 'are', 'favorite', 'patients', 'season', 'patients', 'are', 'strange', 'demented', 'delightful', 'One', 'favorite', 'features', 'show', 'inset', 'flashbacks', 'issue', 'being', 'discussed', 'couch', 'visual', 'images', 'are', 'generally', 'hilariously', 'disturbing.I', 'am', 'also', 'fond', 'fact', 'Katz', 'son', 'Ben', '23', 'year', 'old', 'slacker', 'have', 'many', 'not', 'more', 'issues', 'patients', 'One', 'favorite', 'recurring', 'plotlines', 'Ben', 'attempt', 'get', 'Katz', 'receptionist', 'date', 'only', 'when', 'great', 'opportunity', 'embarrassment', 'boss', 'open', 'mic', 'night', 'also', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'creative', 'hostility', 'when', 'Ben', 'park', 'subsequently', 'get', 'towed', 'parking', 'zone', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'made', 'Tom', 'Snyder', 'pantry', 'very', 'dry', 'full', 'bizarre', 'mix', 'subtlety', 'snideness', 'true', 'wonder', 'low', 'budget', 'animation', 'not', 'only', 'introduced', 'world', 'delights', 'Squigglevision', 'propagated', 'first', 'season', 'Home', 'Movies', 'made', 'cartoons', 'acceptable', 'adults', 'again', 'years', 'focus', 'kids.This', 'great', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'surreal', 'animation', 'experience', 'recommend', 'highly']","Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist - Season 1"
