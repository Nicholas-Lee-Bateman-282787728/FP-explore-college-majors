1329225,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0036VH972,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Andr&eacute; T&eacute;chin&eacute;'s 'The Girl on the Train' (La fille du RER) focuses on a naive girl Jeanne (&Eacute;milie Dequenne) who fabricates a story about being attacked on a suburban Paris train by black and Arab youths who supposedly mistook her for a Jew. The story is based on a real event that took place in France in 2004, adapted for the stage by Jean-Marie Besset as 'RER', and written for the screen by Besset, Odile Barski, and director T&eacute;chin&eacute;.  T&eacute;chin&eacute;, stating that  'the story became the mirror of all French fears, a revelation of what we call the `collective unconscious.' How an individual's lie is transformed into truth with respect to the community at large and its fears', 'The Girl on the Train' dissects the psychological circumstances and consequences surrounding a bold lie in a rich drama, concentrating on the permutations such an act has one all concerned.Jeanne lives with her single mother Louise (Catherine Deneuve) who manages the family finances as a childcare provider.  Jeanne spends the greater part of her time roller skating and it is on one of her excursions that she meets the rather mysterious Franck (Nicolas Duvauchelle), a young wrestler who immediately attempts to win Jeanne's attention and affection despite Jeanne's insecurities.  They eventually respond to the mutual chemistry and Franck searches for a way to help Jeanne out of financial difficulties: they become caretakers in a warehouse home, which is unbeknownst to Jeanne, a drug trafficking site. An incident occurs when a 'buyer' shows up and Franck is stabbed in defending his caretaker job and Jeanne's future.  Jeanne is distraught but when she visits Franck in the hospital, Franck blames Jeanne for his bad luck and rebuffs her - he must now serve prison time for his involvement in the drug game.Now, torn between her loss of money, her new 'home', and the love of Franck, Jeanne plans a manner of striking back:  she slices her skin, clips her hair, and paints swastikas on her abdomen and reports that she has been attacked by anti-Semites.  Louise seeks the assistance of an old flame who is now the important Jewish lawyer Samuel Bleistein (Michel Blanc) - man with whom Jeanne had unsuccessfully interviewed for a job - and what Louise thought would be a protection for both Franck and Jeanne results in Jeanne's confession that she fabricated the entire incident, a factor that disrupts the lives of all those affected by the lie, especially the family of Bleistein already teetering on disintegration due to the rocky marriage of his son and daughter-in-law and the preparation for the grandson's contested Bar Mitzvah.T&eacute;chin&eacute; knows how to take seemingly ordinary people and circumstances and show the profound effect of evil wherever it raises its head.  The film is enhanced by the verismo photography by Julien Hirsch and the apropos musical score by Philippe Sarde.  While this film is not quite up to the standards of T&eacute;chin&eacute;'s films such as 'Wild Reeds', 'My Favorite Season', 'Changing Times' or 'Strayed', it still maintains that realistic surface beneath which lies the real grit of life.

1329226,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B0036VH972,Kona,"[7, 8]","In this story set in Paris, we get to know two very different families and see them eventually connect.  The first is that of Jeanne, a rather aimless and unmotivated young woman who lives with her mother (Catherine Deneuve) and spends her time roller blading.  The second is that of successful lawyer Nathan who is about to celebrate his grandson's bar mitzvah.  When Jeanne becomes involved with a low-life creep and does something very foolish, it is Nathan who comes to the rescue.The movie is based on the true story of a girl who claimed she was attacked on a train because she was Jewish.  The nation was shocked and even more outraged when it turned out she made it all up.  The movie is made in a pseudo-New Wave style with unsympathetic, isolated characters, abrupt scene cuts, unresolved storylines and the constant blaring of passing trains.  Jeanne's lie was a huge event in France, but here it is merely a part of her outsider's psyche.If you like stories about complex, non-mainstream characters, this is the movie for you.  It is blunt and unapologetic, fascinating and above all, very real.

Of course the name of legendary Catherine Deneuve caught my attention, but the DVD box had plenty of great praise plastered from various media all over it, so I of course picked it up.""The Girl on the Train"" (La Fille du RER) (105 min; originally released in 2009) brings the story of Jeanne who lives with her mother (played by Catherine Deneuve). By happenstance while rollerblading she meets a guy who courts her and eventually the two fall for each other. While the two of them are house-sitting, the boyfriend gets attacked, and from there the movie changes tracks completely. Jeanne makes up a story about being attacked herself in a train station in what she portrays to be an anti-Jewish act. The movie goes on from there, and I was simply bewildered. It seems that the first hour of the movie (Jeanne and her boyfriend) are completely forgotten or dissed of, for no apparent reason. The conclusion of the movie left me scratching my head as well.I was astounded to read in the movie's final credits that this is based on actual events. The entire movie made little sense to me, and it was a huge let-down for me. The girl playing Jeanne brought a good performance but it didn't eliminate the sense to my that I had just wasted my time watching this.

1329228,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B0036VH972,"prisrob ""pris,""","[1, 1]","This film is a character study of the mysteries of several lives. It is fiction, based on a true to life case of a young French woman who said she had been attacked on a train by neo-Nazi antisemites. After a bit she confessed she had made the whole thing up. It seems it is much easier to tell a lie than to maintain it.Emilie Dequenne is Jeanne, who lives in the outskirts of Paris and is looking for a job as a secretary. Her mother Louise, played by Catherine Deneuve, cares for children. Louise understands the resumes written by Jeanne are full of spelling errors and badly written. But, Jeanne is independent and wants to find a job on her own. Her daily life consists of rollerblading and we are led to this exercise throughout the film. On one occasion, Jeanne meets a young tough man who is a wrestler.. They move in together and under secretive circumstances make a living. Jeanne is treated badly by this young man and left to find her own way. She is emotionally unable to handle the rejection and makes a tragic mistake.The film is divided into two parts, circumstances and consequences, each has overlapping characters and themes. The first half describes Jeanne's relationship with her mother and her young man. The second half shows us a Jewish family, the Bleisteins. They become part of the story, as a background into Louise's young life. Mr. Bleistein is a lawyer and had a crush on Louise when she was a young married woman. Louise involves the family when she needs legal assistance for Jeanne. The Bleisteins are a complex, Jewish family with issues of their own. But they are helpful to Jeanne and Louise and in the process come to understand themselves a little more fully.This is a film of psychological trauma and how we deal with our lot in life. The people who love us and those who care. As Jeanne said after she admitted lying, &#34;I wanted my parents to take care of me, my boyfriend to take care of me.&#34; Her solution was to find a scapegoat that French officials could embrace even as they gave her the attention she so clearly craved.&#34; Guardian UKRecommended. prisrob 06-06-10",4,Circumstances And Consequences,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,2120,"['film', 'character', 'study', 'mysteries', 'several', 'lives', 'fiction', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'case', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'attacked', 'train', 'neo-Nazi', 'antisemites', 'bit', 'confessed', 'had', 'made', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'much', 'easier', 'tell', 'lie', 'maintain', 'it.Emilie', 'Dequenne', 'Jeanne', 'who', 'outskirts', 'Paris', 'looking', 'job', 'secretary', 'mother', 'Louise', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'children', 'Louise', 'resumes', 'written', 'Jeanne', 'are', 'full', 'spelling', 'errors', 'badly', 'written', 'Jeanne', 'independent', 'find', 'job', 'own', 'daily', 'life', 'rollerblading', 'are', 'led', 'exercise', 'film', 'one', 'occasion', 'Jeanne', 'young', 'tough', 'man', 'who', 'wrestler..', 'move', 'together', 'secretive', 'circumstances', 'make', 'living', 'Jeanne', 'treated', 'badly', 'young', 'man', 'left', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'emotionally', 'unable', 'handle', 'rejection', 'tragic', 'mistake.The', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'circumstances', 'consequences', 'overlapping', 'characters', 'themes', 'first', 'half', 'Jeanne', 'relationship', 'mother', 'young', 'man', 'second', 'half', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Bleisteins', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'background', 'Louise', 'young', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Bleistein', 'lawyer', 'had', 'crush', 'Louise', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'Louise', 'family', 'when', 'legal', 'assistance', 'Jeanne', 'Bleisteins', 'are', 'complex', 'Jewish', 'family', 'issues', 'own', 'are', 'helpful', 'Jeanne', 'Louise', 'process', 'come', 'understand', 'little', 'more', 'fully.This', 'film', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'how', 'deal', 'lot', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'who', 'care', 'Jeanne', 'said', 'admitted', 'lying', '34', 'wanted', 'parents', 'take', 'care', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'care', 'me.', '34', 'solution', 'was', 'find', 'scapegoat', 'French', 'officials', 'could', 'embrace', 'even', 'gave', 'attention', 'so', 'clearly', 'craved.', '34', 'Guardian', 'UKRecommended', 'prisrob', '06-06-10']",N/A

Second, people don't really think all the time when they go out and do things. That is what happens here in a simplistic nutshell, when ""a girl on a train"" makes headlines after claiming that she has been attacked and that she was the victim of race-based hatred. She has had trouble with the law recently, losing someone she loved in the midst of it, and that sting seems to make her want to show how inept the law is and how much hatred there is. So, she concocts a plan that people can readily believe. This turns into something of a frenzy however and, in the midst of it, there's one person with answers that nobody wants to hear anymore.When i first watched this movie, I didn't know what to expect and wasn't sure if I really liked the way the movie simply ended. It didn't seem like it really wanted to continue or like it ran out of things to say when, in reality, there would be a lot more happening. I kept wondering more about the girl and the things she left behind, if the relationships she had were strained more by this action, if the news chewed on her like people around her seemed to from the start (and, yes, her story is not a good one when she tells it but everyone - mother, supposed friends, etc - simply discount what she says), and so on. This does not harm the movie and you wathc it, seeing the character study and the relation she has with the things/people/ideas surrounding her and how they play out.I really thought the acting was top-notch for a story that would have been really low profile in some ways, and it did a good job reflecting actual events. It was not a mirror, mind you, and I do not think it wa smeant to be. What it was meant to be was something of a commentary or perhaps simply a showing of how choice creates impact - and it did a nice job of this. Honestly, that caught me off-guard a bit because I wasn't expecting it. I also wasn't expecting the story to actually have so much sympathy when dealing with our lead character. Still, when you see her you can understand the events leading to this choice and you can feel for her because she isn't troubled - she is around trouble, drowning in her mother's expectations, and she is not at all helped by the way her mother throws her ""lifelines.""I thought the movie had a statement to make and it made it.
