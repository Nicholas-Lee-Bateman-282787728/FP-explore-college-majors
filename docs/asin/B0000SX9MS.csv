782239,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B0000SX9MS,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[7, 9]","What a wonderfully hidden gem. ""I capture the castle"" is a film of unrequited love. Not my normal cup of tea but the production values and acting here makes it a very fine film.The film concerns Rose and Cassandra.. two sisters in 1934 England. They live in a castle due to their father's eccentric wishes to write there. He has however, never written anything in the time they have been there. They are poor and desperate. Into this comes new landlords to the castle, Simon, Henry Thomas, and Neil, Marc Blucas, who are each interested in Rose. At first Cassandra is happy for Rose that she gets the rich Simon to fall for her, making the family rich, but when Cassandra falls for him too she finds herself wishing that she could marry Simon.The acting is what makes this movie wonderful. The girl who plays Cassandra is perfect for the role and makes the movie. Thankfully the sisters relationship never falls into soap territory. Upon learning that Cassie is in love with Simon, Rose doesn't have a fit, but rather opines she would perfer Cassie to have him to if she could only get Simon to feel that way.The only performance I found lacking was Henry Thomas who was so stiff and mannered that I couldn't quite figure out what Cassandra sees in him. I admit I never read the book so if you haven't I think you will like the movie. On its own it is a well made and well rounded movie.",4,Hidden Gem,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1387,"['What', 'wonderfully', 'hidden', 'gem', 'capture', 'castle', 'film', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Not', 'normal', 'cup', 'tea', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'here', 'very', 'fine', 'film.The', 'film', 'concerns', 'Rose', 'Cassandra..', 'two', 'sisters', '1934', 'England', 'live', 'castle', 'due', 'father', 'eccentric', 'wishes', 'write', 'there', 'however', 'never', 'written', 'anything', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'are', 'poor', 'desperate', 'Into', 'new', 'landlords', 'castle', 'Simon', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'Neil', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Rose', 'first', 'Cassandra', 'happy', 'Rose', 'rich', 'Simon', 'fall', 'making', 'family', 'rich', 'when', 'Cassandra', 'too', 'wishing', 'could', 'marry', 'Simon.The', 'acting', 'what', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'girl', 'who', 'Cassandra', 'perfect', 'role', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'sisters', 'relationship', 'never', 'soap', 'territory', 'learning', 'Cassie', 'love', 'Simon', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'rather', 'opines', 'would', 'perfer', 'Cassie', 'have', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'Simon', 'feel', 'only', 'performance', 'found', 'lacking', 'was', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'stiff', 'mannered', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Cassandra', 'admit', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'own', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'rounded', 'movie']",I Capture the Castle
782240,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B0000SX9MS,audrey,"[17, 19]","I Capture the Castle, based on the 1933 novel of the same name by Dodie Smith, beautifully captures the characters and plot elements of the book and also stands on its own as an entertaining film.  It is the story of a poor and isolated family in the English countryside.  17-year old Cassandra offers a charming (if flawed) narration to her family story -- the tale of how her brilliant novelist father's long-standing writer's block has affected her beautiful sister Rose and free-spirit stepmother Topaz.  Things seem to be going nowhere but downhill until two brothers show up -- the new owners of the family's rundown castle.  Though the plot has few surprises, the film is still quite engaging and fun, thanks in large part to a fine adaptation, great cast and terrific design.  One needn't have read the book to enjoy the film, and those who love the book should not be disappointed.DVD extras include a commentary track with the director, writer and producer; an interview with Ramola Garai, who plays Cassandra (8 minutes); 4 deleted scenes and an alternate ending; a trailer.

782245,A1HEX4P1LFSZ1M,B0000SX9MS,Dame Derevko,"[1, 1]","I Capture The Castle is one of my favorite coming of age novels, the movie while not completely flawless and 100% accurate to the book is in my opinion nonetheless wonderfully acted by Romola Garai as the narrator Cassandra, Bill Nighy as her father; once a celebrated author but who for years has been suffering writer's block and is seemingly oblivious to how low the family's fortunes have fallen. Rounding out the supporting cast are Sinead Cusack, Tara Fitzgerald, Rose Byrne, Marc Blucas, Henry Thomas. The film also includes a rather sweet performance by future Superman Henry Cavill as Cassandra's extremely handsome lovelorn suitor Stephen. The cinematography is exquisite as well. This is one of my favorite British period dramas even if to some it feels like a soap opera. I've enjoyed this movie so much over the years that I bought a new DVD a few months ago to be prepared in case my previous one wears out due to the constant re-watches and friends borrowing it over the years. I was sad to see it be out of print but fortunately I ordered from a great seller. The disc was a Canadian release that was promptly delivered by amazon according to schedule, my only minor complaint is that the disc didn't contain the deleted scenes that were advertised on the page but overall that didn't deter my enjoyment of the movie that to quote the movie version of Cassandra Mortmain I love.

The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by Romola Garai. In her most dramatic scene, a confrontation with her father, she played out her emotions in an over-slow, melodramatic manner like a bad, bad stage play.  I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think ""Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film""?  She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame.  The lead always sets the tone for the film.

782248,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000SX9MS,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is an inordinately beautiful film, blessed by a fine script adapted from the successful novel by Dodie Smith, a fine director who knows how to pace a film, beautiful cinematography, and a cast that is impeccable. ""Capturing the castle"" is both a real storyline and a metaphor for the struggle to find the self at the doorstep of maturity. What begins as a fairytale adventure - a small family moves into a real though dilapidated castle after the father is released from custody for wife abuse - becomes a withering fantasy as reality creeps into their lives. Since the mother died the father is unable to continue his successful flow of writing and hopes that living in a castle will open his writer's block. His daughters and son must adapt to the pauper life despite their 'castle', share their dreams, and eventually the light toward escape comes in the form of two American brothers who now own the property on which the castle sits. At this point the story frolics through the romances of the sisters, the addition of a stepmother and the eventual resolution of dreams for one daughter and the comfortable longing for love for the other daughter.The cast includes the radiant Romola Garai and Rose Byrne as the sisters, Bill Nighy as the blocked writer/father, Tara Fitzgerald (VERY sensitive actress) as the stepmother, Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas as the American brothers, and one Henry Cavill as Stephen - the beautiful Adonis boy who remains in the background and serves only as a sensual propellant to the girl's grounded dreams.In a field of movies that try very hard to be Oscar contenders, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE seems content to be exactly what it is - a luminously beautiful simple film that will capture your heart.

Based on the package, I never would have rented it myself. But the opportunity to see Rose again after discovering her in the AussiTHE GODDESS OF 1967, then enthralled by her in the AmericanWICKER PARK, was too much. And what a joy! Here were people who knew how to bring out her angelic beauty. And, doesn't she have the prettiest profile in all Christendom? What amazes me most is that in those 3 films, she created 3 distinct characters. If I hadn't known, I'd never make the connection.While it was correct to make Rose the prettier sister (she played ""Rose"" -- isn't that a nice coincidence), don't underestimate Romola Garai as the sane and sensible sister with her potent girl-next-door allure. She had to carry the film on her 17 or 18 year-old shoulders (the age of the characer she played -- another nice coincidence). And she did it is with ease.If you haven't yet, check out the commentary by the director, producer and screenwriter. They are chatty and informative at the same time. However, they were a little disingenuous when they spoke of the American actors, Henry Thomas and Mark Blucas. The producer and director said they were the best American actors they auditioned capable of uttering the ""literary"" dialog. A more honest appraisal would be that they were the best actors they could get to fit within their P-pinching budget. The dialog wasn't that unnatural and there are many young American actors who could have done better. At least, these two managed to show more dimensions than British pretty boy Henry Cavill.I can't say enuf about the rest of the supporting cast, however. Bill Nighy, Tara Fitzgerald and Joe Sowerbutts as the rest of the family couldn't be better. In a few scenes, Sinead Cusak, as the young mens' mother, renders a perfect accent and wonderful vividness as the blunt American matron.And let's not forget to include the decaying castle representing the plight of the family. And the 1930s recreations (in costume and setting). All evocatively filmed.Like other British films with American characters, this could be seen as allegorical, but this presents the culture clash so ambiguously that it doesn't qualify as anti-American. Now, that's different!Thanks, again.

It was like nothing on earth and didn't seem to be synched up to her lip movements.The little boy who played Thomas, the stud who played Stephen, and Tara Fitzgerald as Topax were all excellent.  What happened to Tara Fitzgerald, only a few years ago she would have been playing Rose, she was the ingenue in every British movie imported into US theaters.  Sad the way time flutters by and today's hot young thing is now playing tomorrow's stepmother!  And her hair looked like the hair of an old hag in a Walter Scott novel-one who lives in a cave.I thoroughly approve of Romola Garai as Cassandra Mortmain.  I thought she was perfect for the part.  Rose Byrne was not as gorgeous as I had hoped, as Rose, with her huge cheeks and beady little eyes.  She looked ghastly and gained 20 years when Mrs. Cotton cut off her And makeup artists should have painted over that distracting blemish on her face that grew worse throughout the movie.  However she was perfectly piquant in the exotic pink crinoline dress with black shoes and the red feather in her hair that she wote when bringing her family to dinner with the Cottons.  Cassandra's blue dress she wore in the nightclub was also lovely.Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas were also underwhelming.  Blucas used to be so good looking as Riley Finn on the TV version of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Here he looked pasty and unfit.  Henry Thomas was doing all his acting with his eyes.  He seemed to be leading Cassandra on during their dance to ""You and The Night and The Music.""  It was mesmerizing, but I for once thought he was in love with her, afterwards he said he kissed her just because she was so funny and amusing and sweet.  Right.Finally I'm of two minds about Bill Nighy.  He's always the same in every picture, but I think his manic, worn-out quietude was fitting for James Mortmain.

Daughters Rose (Rose Byrne) and Cassandra (Romola Garai) hate living in the isolated ruin and are desperately tired of being poor.  The new landlords come to visit; Simon Cotton (Henry Thomas) and his brother are rich, young, and single.  Rose sets her sights on Simon and vows to marry him for his money, even if she doesn't love him.  And younger sister Cassandra wants very much to be in love, too.The story is narrated by Cassandra as she writes in her diary.  Romola Garai is perfect as the plain, thoughtful younger sister, the lovely Byrne is convincing as the flirty big sister, and Henry Thomas is a sincere suitor.  Bill Nighy steals the show with his larger-than-life personality and manic behavior.  The year 1936 is reproduced in fine detail, and the English countryside is beautifully photographed.

I must say I have been very pleased with my choice.I enjoy this film immensely. It brings to mind that other fascinating British adaptation, &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; starring Kate Beckinsale. &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; has that sweet, romantic, dreamy feel that completely enraptures the viewer with its charm, humor and wit.The story centers around 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;) and her eccentric family.  Her father (Bill Nighy of &quot;Love Actually&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot;) is an author who hasn't written a word in 10 years. Her sister Rose (Rose Byrne of &quot;Troy&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Episode II) yearns to marry well and get away from their dreary, depressed circumstances. Her stepmother Topaz (Tara Fitzgerald of &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;) is an eccentric artist who tries to keep her family together. Cassandra and her brother Thomas appear to be the only sensible beings in their household.  Everyone else seems to be falling apart. Then there is their Adonis-like helper Stephen (an eye-opening role for Henry Cavill of &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;) who really does remind me of a Greek god.The Mortmain's lives are turned upside down with the arrival of the wealthy Cotton brothers (Henry Thomas of &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;I'm With Lucy&quot; and Marc Blucas).  Soon enough, Stephen falls in love with Cassandra who falls in love with older brother Simon Cotton who  falls in love with Rose. Before long, Rose is planning her wedding.  The story climaxes when secrets are revealed and the phrase &quot;you cannot control who you fall in love with&quot; really does come to play.The highlights of this film are the brilliant performances, namely of Romola Garai, Rose Byrne and Bill Nighy; the gorgeous and dreamy cinematography; and the enchanting story. It is, above all, a story of love and hope, and Cassandra's optimism throughout the story really shines through.

782261,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0000SX9MS,mirasreviews,"[7, 10]","17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai) lives with her eccentric father (Bill Nighy) and stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald), her older sister Rose (Rose Byrne), and younger brother in run-down castle in the English countryside. Her father is a struggling writer who is unable to reproduce the success of his first book, and, without an income, the family is plunged into poverty. When the old castle's owner dies, his nephews from America, Simon (Henry Thomas) and Neil (Marc Blucas), inherit the property and the neighboring estate. Rose sees the presence of these eligible bachelors as the opportunity of a lifetime to marry well, escape the countryside, and provide means for her family. But Cassandra and Rose's upbringing in isolation among idiosyncratic relatives may be an impediment as the young women find that they lack the understanding of society that would help them find husbands and love.""I Capture the Castle"" is based on the popular novel of the same name by Dodie Smith. It is basically a soap opera set in rural England of the 1930s. Poor young ladies meet rich eligible men and fall in love. But who will marry whom, and will they marry for love or money? But it is a charming soap opera -only slightly sappy- with an appealing conglomeration of attractive and eccentric characters. Cassandra, who narrates the story, is its flawed heroine, who tries her best to hold her family together and sort out everyone's problems. I'm not sure she acts like a 17-year-old. She is, by her own admission, ""self-consciously naive"". But I think the book and the film are aimed at a younger audience, so Cassandra is in many ways more like them. The film does have one unfortunate characteristic of a soap opera in that it eventually gives the impression of repeating itself. Nevertheless, it is a light-hearted entertaining story told through the occasionally melodramatic experiences of a reluctantly romantic young woman. Henry Thomas gives a nice convincing and sympathetic performance. Recommended, especially for 9-13 year old girls.Those who are familiar with the book may wonder why this movie is rated R, since the book is a favorite among pre-teen girls. It is rated R for nudity of the topless variety in one scene. It shouldn't be. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, is a bit of a nudist.

782262,A3ATQ4Q988YHYA,B0000SX9MS,Mr. A. Crowley,"[2, 2]","This film is splendid: it is a meditation on life, love, and the the intense allure as well as the perils of a life devoted to art. Set in the gorgeous English countryside during the 1930s, the film tells its delicate story with a quiet grace. To summarize the plot briefly: an English family moves to a massive, decaying but impressive castle in the countryside with the hope of encouraging the writer-father (the brilliant Bill Nighy) to finish a second novel. The family is unusual, decidedly Bohemian, and believes in an ideal of Art but suffers bitterly for it, wallowing in poverty. The eldest daughter, played by the beautiful Rose Byrne, desperately longs for a life of luxury and wealth, which is represented by the two attractive American brothers who come to claim the castle as part of their heritage. Rose Byrne as Rose and her younger sister Cassie (played by the excellent, exceptionally talented Romola Garai) become entangled in a difficult, life-changing relationship with the American brothers as the family's fortune ebbs and flows. The film also features gorgeous cinematography as it is filled with breathtaking shots of the countryside (it was filmed on the Isle of Man) and the rambling castle.I have read the wonderful novel by Dodie Smith, an accomplished English playwright and novelist (who also happened to be the author of The Hundred and One Dalmations, among other works) and I have seen the film several times. The film does not disappoint; in fact, I consider it a lovely and articulate adaptation of the novel. The acting is brilliantly fine: the best performance by far is Bill Nighy's fabulous turn as the crippled (by writer's block) writer who was once hailed as the next great British novelist, a po-mo version of James Joyce. He has been damaged by life and inhibited by the highest of expectations that were unfairly imposed upon him after his debut made a dramatic splash. The story is told through the point of view of Cassie (Garai), who writes compulsively to sort out her emotions and who matures as the film progresses, discovering secrets about herself, her family, and the American brothers that change the lives of everyone involved.",5,A gorgeously photographed British film about the agonies of love and the pain of growing up.,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,2184,"['film', 'splendid', 'meditation', 'life', 'love', 'intense', 'allure', 'as', 'well', 'perils', 'life', 'devoted', 'art', 'Set', 'gorgeous', 'English', 'countryside', '1930s', 'film', 'delicate', 'story', 'quiet', 'grace', 'summarize', 'plot', 'briefly', 'English', 'family', 'moves', 'massive', 'decaying', 'impressive', 'castle', 'countryside', 'hope', 'encouraging', 'writer-father', 'brilliant', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'finish', 'second', 'novel', 'family', 'unusual', 'decidedly', 'Bohemian', 'ideal', 'Art', 'suffers', 'bitterly', 'wallowing', 'poverty', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'desperately', 'life', 'luxury', 'wealth', 'represented', 'two', 'attractive', 'American', 'brothers', 'who', 'come', 'claim', 'castle', 'part', 'heritage', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Rose', 'younger', 'sister', 'Cassie', 'played', 'excellent', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'become', 'entangled', 'difficult', 'life-changing', 'relationship', 'American', 'brothers', 'family', 'fortune', 'ebbs', 'flows', 'film', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'filled', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'countryside', 'was', 'filmed', 'Isle', 'Man', 'rambling', 'castle.I', 'have', 'read', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Dodie', 'Smith', 'accomplished', 'English', 'playwright', 'novelist', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'author', 'Hundred', 'One', 'Dalmations', 'other', 'works', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fact', 'consider', 'lovely', 'articulate', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'acting', 'brilliantly', 'fine', 'best', 'performance', 'far', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'fabulous', 'turn', 'crippled', 'writer', 'block', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'hailed', 'next', 'great', 'British', 'novelist', 'po-mo', 'version', 'James', 'Joyce', 'been', 'damaged', 'life', 'inhibited', 'highest', 'expectations', 'were', 'unfairly', 'imposed', 'debut', 'made', 'dramatic', 'splash', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Cassie', 'Garai', 'who', 'compulsively', 'sort', 'out', 'emotions', 'who', 'film', 'discovering', 'secrets', 'family', 'American', 'brothers', 'change', 'lives', 'everyone', 'involved']",I Capture the Castle

Of course the entire she loves him/he loves the other girl/who loves someone else setup of the plot makes for a sad and poignant tale, but the actors do not lose themselves in saccharine or trite portrayals of lovesick fools or trounced love interests.

It's a luminous coming-of-age story about an English child/girl/woman (Ramola Garai) who lives with her father (Bill Nighy), a successful author suffering prolonged writer's block, gorgeous slightly older sister, bohemian arty stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald), and bespectacled young brother. They move to a cold, drafty, leaky, romantic and picturesque castle in the middle of nowhere, fall behind on the rent, wear an odd shade of green that resulted when the arty and lovely stepmom dyed damn near everything one day.Rose, the older sister, yearns for wealth. The property on which they live is owned by two brothers who come to inspect things - and that's where the real story begins. Narrated through the POV of Cassandra (Garai), the movie turns into an utterly engaging, wise and wonderful coming-of-age tale of hopes, dreams, plots and counterplots, dashed yearnings, and a painful journey toward adulthood. Hilarious and bittersweet at the same time. Absolutely first-rate performances by the entire cast in a film which ends with the realistic but still hopeful line in `words of one syllable': I love.

Why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping?  Teens love their romance, boy-girl breakups, and crush's.  This media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on --- let the kids have their childhood.Oh, how many young sis' have coveted their older sister's boyfriends.  All of them! And that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed, but in 60 percent of American girls - the actual event begins with marriage. In this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love: the sisters want to marry up at any cost.  Is that a good lesson for teen gals?Perhaps I'm not being fair on the philosophical side, but how about a believable story we can care about?  You won't find it in I Capture the Castle.  You'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene, the eccentric writer does his prison scene, the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene, and suddenly the guys show up like Price Charmings out of nowhere like we haven't seen that one before.

I should say also that the British actors outshine the American actors to a noticeable degree.The story is engaging and the younger of the two daughters (whose story this is, ultimately) is sweet, charming and worthy of either Jane Austen or Henry James.The location shots in Wales and the Isle of Man are very nice.

First off, why shut out most of your built-in audience by making an R-rated adaptation of a young adult book? Why make it worse with some of the strangest casting decisions in modern filmdom? Why not at least try to whip it into some sort of shape that readers of the book might recognize? Well, to be fair, it's quite possible they did that; that may, in fact, be the source of all the awkwardness. Let the viewer decide.Cassandra Mortmain (Atonement bombshell Romola Garai) and her odd family-- older sister Rose (28 Weeks Later's Rose Byrne), father James (Pirates of the Caribbean's Bill Nighy), and stepmother Topaz (Brassed Off's Tara Fitzgerald)-- move to a crumbling castle in the country so James, a previously successful writer with a decade-long case of writer's block, can finally start working again. The problem is, it doesn't work, and a couple of years down the road, the family are penniless. Enter the Cotton family, who own the land on which the castle stands. The two brothers, Neil (They's Marc Blukas) and Simon (Deadbirds' Henry Thomas), capture Rose's eye, and she sets her heart on marrying one of them to pull her family out of poverty. Thus begins a melodrama of manners.And melodrama it is; nary a chance to overnarrate, overact, overdecorate, or overdirect is passed up. Even at less than two hours and being based on a novel, the film is brutally slow-paced. One wonders what swathes of prose got cut to make this screenplay fit to time, and whether all the book's actual action, plot furtherance, and character development was contained in it. (That's actually not a bad guess, as much of what goes wrong with novel adaptations usually has to do with one or more of those three aspects getting cut; it's a rare thing all three fall by the wayside, however.) The sole bright light in all this is Romola Garai's performance. For all I know, she's overacting in every scene, but relative to what's around her, it at least seems understated and heartfelt. Other than that, though, and Tara Fitzgerald's character's propensity to go dancing naked in the dark, I couldn't find a single reason to keep watching this film, save to spare those of you who've never seen it before the same boredom I suffered. *",1,I suffer the boredom,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2580,"['Capture', 'Castle', 'Tim', 'Fywell', '2003', 'Capture', 'Castle', 'was', 'adapted', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'awkwardly-titled', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'time', 'TV', 'director', 'Tim', 'Fywell', 'lack', 'insistence', 'godawful', 'title', 'be', 'changed', 'should', 'tip', 'off', 'awkwardness', 'good', 'deal', 'what', ""'re"", 'exceptionally', 'odd', 'adaptation', 'First', 'off', 'why', 'shut', 'out', 'most', 'built-in', 'audience', 'making', 'R-rated', 'adaptation', 'young', 'adult', 'book', 'Why', 'make', 'worse', 'strangest', 'casting', 'decisions', 'modern', 'filmdom', 'Why', 'not', 'least', 'try', 'whip', 'sort', 'shape', 'readers', 'book', 'might', 'recognize', 'Well', 'be', 'fair', 'quite', 'possible', 'did', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'source', 'awkwardness', 'Let', 'viewer', 'decide.Cassandra', 'Mortmain', 'Atonement', 'bombshell', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'odd', 'family', 'older', 'sister', 'Rose', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'father', 'James', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'stepmother', 'Topaz', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'move', 'crumbling', 'castle', 'country', 'so', 'James', 'previously', 'successful', 'writer', 'decade-long', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'can', 'finally', 'start', 'working', 'again', 'problem', ""n't"", 'work', 'couple', 'years', 'road', 'family', 'are', 'penniless', 'Enter', 'Cotton', 'family', 'who', 'own', 'land', 'castle', 'two', 'brothers', 'Neil', 'Marc', 'Blukas', 'Simon', 'Deadbirds', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'capture', 'Rose', 'eye', 'heart', 'marrying', 'one', 'pull', 'family', 'poverty', 'Thus', 'melodrama', 'manners.And', 'melodrama', 'chance', 'overnarrate', 'overact', 'overdecorate', 'overdirect', 'passed', 'up', 'Even', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'being', 'based', 'novel', 'film', 'brutally', 'slow-paced', 'One', 'swathes', 'prose', 'got', 'cut', 'make', 'screenplay', 'fit', 'time', 'book', 'actual', 'action', 'plot', 'furtherance', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'contained', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'guess', 'much', 'what', 'wrong', 'novel', 'adaptations', 'usually', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'three', 'aspects', 'getting', 'cut', 'rare', 'thing', 'three', 'fall', 'wayside', 'however', 'sole', 'bright', 'light', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'performance', 'know', 'overacting', 'scene', 'relative', 'what', 'around', 'least', 'understated', 'heartfelt', 'Other', 'though', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'character', 'propensity', 'go', 'dancing', 'naked', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'single', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'save', 'spare', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'same', 'boredom', 'suffered', '*']",I Capture the Castle

I am not sure the viewers are able to grasp the depth of the inner turmoil both sisters are undergoing, the nature of the father's work or the whole family involvement in this work. The large impact the father's writing (or lack of writing) has on their lives and not just money wise. The film, I admit, is nice to watch and the characters portrayal is very close to what I imagined while reading. The castle itself is amazing and lends its atmosphere to the whole movie - you can almost feel how damp and cold it is. In this case only I fell that seeing is better then reading. However, I remained feeling that if I had only seen the movie I would not have truly understood the story. This is not just a love story. Romantic love is just a vehicle to grow up, or so I understood it, and bonds of love and caring between family members are also one of the main themes of this work.All actors have fresh, very fitting faces, close to the way I perceived them upon reading. Romola Garai especially is great as Cassandra, a girl in an &quot;in between&quot; stage, turning from a young adolescent to a clever woman whose personal aches and pains bring on a better understanding of other people. Tara Fitzgerald is captivating as the stepmother Topaz.In spite of my criticism I give this movie 4 points, as it is quite a different unique movie that holds some of the book's magic.",4,Of less value then the book but holding some of its magic,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,1955,"['book', 'Dodie', 'Smith', 'such', 'superb', 'read', 'different', 'air', 'time', 'place', 'sincere', 'inner', 'growing', 'up', 'account', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'rise', 'up', 'magic', 'sure', 'fail', 'book', 'captivate', 'reader', 'first', 'pages', 'detailed', 'account', 'eccentric', 'weird', 'family', 'Having', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'viewing', 'was', 'largely', 'affected', 'fact', 'read', 'book', 'beforehand', 'thus', 'necessarily', 'damaged', 'objective', 'judgement', 'film', 'stand-alone', 'work', 'art.Yes', 'compared', 'book', 'much', 'inferior', 'work', 'art', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'viewers', 'are', 'able', 'grasp', 'depth', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'sisters', 'are', 'undergoing', 'nature', 'father', 'work', 'whole', 'family', 'involvement', 'work', 'large', 'impact', 'father', 'writing', 'lack', 'writing', 'lives', 'not', 'just', 'money', 'wise', 'film', 'admit', 'nice', 'watch', 'characters', 'portrayal', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'imagined', 'reading', 'castle', 'amazing', 'atmosphere', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'how', 'damp', 'cold', 'case', 'only', 'fell', 'seeing', 'better', 'then', 'reading', 'However', 'remained', 'feeling', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'truly', 'understood', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'Romantic', 'love', 'just', 'vehicle', 'grow', 'up', 'so', 'understood', 'bonds', 'love', 'caring', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'one', 'main', 'themes', 'work.All', 'actors', 'have', 'fresh', 'very', 'fitting', 'close', 'way', 'perceived', 'reading', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'especially', 'great', 'Cassandra', 'girl', 'quot', 'quot', 'stage', 'turning', 'young', 'adolescent', 'clever', 'woman', 'personal', 'aches', 'pains', 'bring', 'better', 'understanding', 'other', 'people', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'captivating', 'stepmother', 'Topaz.In', 'spite', 'criticism', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'points', 'quite', 'different', 'unique', 'movie', 'book', 'magic']",I Capture the Castle

I thoroughly enjoyed this coming of age movie narrated by Cassandra.  After seeing the raving reviews of the book, which I've never read, I suppose I ought to get it. The movie was well acted, kept my interest, and I wish for a castle myself.  As usual, great English story filled with complex characters, fantastic plot, and lines that keep you thinking long after it's over.

The story loses something in translation to film; it is better told and has more humor, subtlety and insight in the book (see my review). Beyond that, there is Bill Nighy, a wonderful actor, who is just not on his game here, despite being appropriately cast. If you see him in this and remember him in ""The Girl in the Cafe"", ""Notes on a Scandal"" and even ""Love, Actually"", you will see the difference. He's good but not as good as this odd and juicy part deserves. Then there's Henry Thomas: maybe my fault rather than his, but I cannot see him in this role.  The rest of the cast is fine and believable, especialy 16 or 17 year old actress Romola Garai. An instantly formidible presence here as in ""Atonement""(woefully under-recognized for that one), ""Emma"" and others.  There are also a couple of quick nightime views of a GP Bugatti, for which I would have added an extra half-star if half-stars were available.",3,Romola Garai,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,977,"['worthwhile', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'something', 'translation', 'film', 'better', 'told', 'more', 'humor', 'subtlety', 'insight', 'book', 'see', 'review', 'Beyond', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'who', 'just', 'not', 'game', 'here', 'being', 'appropriately', 'cast', 'see', 'remember', 'Girl', 'Cafe', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'even', 'Love', 'Actually', 'will', 'see', 'difference', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'odd', 'juicy', 'part', 'deserves', 'Then', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'maybe', 'fault', 'rather', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'believable', 'especialy', '16', '17', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'instantly', 'formidible', 'presence', 'here', 'Atonement', 'woefully', 'under-recognized', 'one', 'Emma', 'others', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'quick', 'nightime', 'views', 'GP', 'Bugatti', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'extra', 'half-star', 'half-stars', 'were', 'available']",I Capture the Castle
782275,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0000SX9MS,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I have yet to read the novel upon which this movie is based, so I can only comment on the movie itself. I enjoyed it and thought that both the female leads, Romola Garai and Rose Byrne delivered commendable and credible performances.The story itself is a coming-of-age story set in 1930s England - the movie begins via flashback as a once successful writer [Bill Nighy] moves his family [2 young daughters and a wife] from London to the countryside, taking up residence in an old castle which they lease from the owner. A decade passes and the writer is still struggling to overcome his writer's block - the movie progresses with narration by his younger daughter Cassandra [Romola Garai who also shone in ""Daniel Deronda""], a 17-year-old with a talent for writing. It is Cassandra who makes candid observations about her family, now almost destitute with no income to live on. The family has lost the mother [died], and her place is taken by bohemian stepmother Topaz [Tara Fitzgerald,], an artist and free spirit who likes dancing nude in the rain. Rose [Rose Byrne] is the older sister, beautiful yet troubled, and there is also a much younger sibling, a boy who seems unperturbed by the deprived circumstances the family lives in.Things change when a pair of brothers come to visit the estate - the older Simon [Henry Thomas] is the heir to the estate and Rose, much aware of the opportunity at hand is determined to become his bride. The younger brother Neil [Marc Blucas, most famous as Riley in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series] thinks both sisters are nothing better than gold diggers. Their mother is portrayed by Sinead Cusack, who is marvellous in her brief role, spouting wry observations in each scene she appears in.The rest of the drama follows the girls as they get more deeply embroiled in matters of the heart with some predictable outcomes. Both Romola Garai and Rose Byrne share credible chemistry as a pair of siblings who are as different as night and day, yet very much connected to each other. Their performances carry the movie for the most part - though the romantic element is also a major part of the movie, it is the struggles of the sisters that drew me in the most. Though the movie starts off on a light footing, it gets darker as the movie progresses, exploring the characters in depth and adding more substance to an otherwise tepid plot.Various themes get explored, some more convincingly than others, but it kept my interest.The cinematography perfectly captures the lush beauty of the English countryside and on the whole, I'd recommend this to fans of British period dramas.",4,Beguiling period piece and a poignant coming-of-age drama,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,2613,"['have', 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'can', 'only', 'comment', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'female', 'leads', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'delivered', 'commendable', 'credible', 'performances.The', 'story', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'set', '1930s', 'England', 'movie', 'flashback', 'once', 'successful', 'writer', '[', 'Bill', 'Nighy', ']', 'family', '2', 'young', 'daughters', 'wife', ']', 'London', 'countryside', 'taking', 'up', 'residence', 'old', 'castle', 'lease', 'owner', 'decade', 'passes', 'writer', 'still', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'writer', 'block', 'movie', 'narration', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Cassandra', '[', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'who', 'also', 'shone', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', ']', '17-year-old', 'talent', 'writing', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'candid', 'observations', 'family', 'now', 'almost', 'destitute', 'income', 'live', 'family', 'lost', 'mother', '[', 'died', ']', 'place', 'taken', 'bohemian', 'stepmother', 'Topaz', '[', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', ']', 'artist', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'dancing', 'nude', 'rain', 'Rose', '[', 'Rose', 'Byrne', ']', 'older', 'sister', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'troubled', 'also', 'much', 'younger', 'sibling', 'boy', 'who', 'unperturbed', 'deprived', 'circumstances', 'family', 'in.Things', 'change', 'when', 'pair', 'brothers', 'come', 'visit', 'estate', 'older', 'Simon', '[', 'Henry', 'Thomas', ']', 'heir', 'estate', 'Rose', 'much', 'aware', 'opportunity', 'hand', 'determined', 'become', 'bride', 'younger', 'brother', 'Neil', '[', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'most', 'famous', 'Riley', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'series', ']', 'sisters', 'are', 'nothing', 'better', 'gold', 'diggers', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'who', 'marvellous', 'brief', 'role', 'spouting', 'wry', 'observations', 'scene', 'in.The', 'rest', 'drama', 'girls', 'get', 'more', 'deeply', 'embroiled', 'matters', 'heart', 'predictable', 'outcomes', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'share', 'credible', 'chemistry', 'pair', 'siblings', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'yet', 'very', 'much', 'connected', 'other', 'performances', 'carry', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'romantic', 'element', 'also', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'struggles', 'sisters', 'drew', 'most', 'movie', 'off', 'light', 'footing', 'darker', 'movie', 'exploring', 'characters', 'depth', 'adding', 'more', 'substance', 'otherwise', 'tepid', 'plot.Various', 'themes', 'get', 'explored', 'more', 'convincingly', 'others', 'kept', 'interest.The', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'lush', 'beauty', 'English', 'countryside', 'whole', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'British', 'period', 'dramas']",I Capture the Castle
