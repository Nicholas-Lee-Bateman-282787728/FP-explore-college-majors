This was an aspect that much of my study had not had any of the depth this documentary displayed. I could argue to some extent the Burns' (both Ken & Rick) view of what caused the conflict but certainly not the dedication to accurately portraying the horrors experienced by the common soldiers and civilians on both sides.

1549156,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B0089VX0UO,albarino,"[1, 1]","Drawing on his brother Ken Burns' successful formula, Ric Burns' 2-hour documentary is a pioneering work of history that will shock and grieve viewers of this lesser studied aspect of the Civil War. It is as good as a documentary of this type can get. Screened on PBS in 2012, D&tCW; is a classic.The film is structured around the careful use of period photographs, a la Ken Burns Civil War series. But Ric Burns also uses tinted photographs - a style in favor during the 1860s - infusing the morbid subject with a subtle and haunting sense of life. Additionally, he stages these photographs in their Victorian period frames, placing them on table tops with oil lamps and family Bibles -- in darkened domestic interiors, shot with color film. This dramatic device serves to remind viewers that these deaths ""came home"" -- even if the bodies often did not. The parlor table became the memorial for the fallen and vanished soldier.Appropriately, most of the interviewees speak in soft, almost hushed, voices, including the Harvard Historian, Drew Gilpin Faust, whose book, The Republic of Suffering, was the basis for the film. The voices of wives and mothers -- North and South -- are heard throughout and are tinged with anguish and mourning. The actors are reading from memoirs and letters from the era. The somber and gripping opening of D&tCW; has a dying Confederate soldier's letter quaveringly voiced as he bids farewell to his Mississippi family. The camera scans down the actual (candlelit) letter and we see the faltering penmanship as the soldier must have struggled to complete his letter before his life slipped away.Viewers will be stunned to learn the amount of bodies left on battlefields, whether hastily buried or abandoned to rot. The federal program to reclaim these bodies for an honorable and dignified burial lasted some 2 years after the war. This had to be done quickly as bitter Southerners whose lands and cities were laid waste often desecrated the bodies of the Union dead. And since the federal recovery/burial program ignored the interment of the Confederate fallen, private societies of Southern ladies were formed and they ventured to battlefields like Gettysburg to reclaim and bury their dead, rescuing the remains from Northern antipathy. As a result Union and Confederate were buried in separate cemeteries, reinforcing the national division. These efforts lasted into the 1870s.For additional information on Americans and their responses to the deaths of loved ones in the Civil War, as well as the culture the war produced, see also:This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War (Vintage Civil War Library)Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil WarAnd the Civil War in our time as it is ""used"" in contemporary society, especially the South, see Tony Horwitz's moving and humorous account:Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War",5,a heart-rending revelation of the war's unprecedented casualties,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,2928,"['Drawing', 'brother', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'successful', 'formula', 'Ric', 'Burns', '2-hour', 'documentary', 'pioneering', 'work', 'history', 'will', 'shock', 'grieve', 'viewers', 'lesser', 'studied', 'aspect', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'good', 'documentary', 'type', 'can', 'get', 'Screened', 'PBS', '2012', 'D', 'tCW', 'classic.The', 'film', 'structured', 'careful', 'use', 'period', 'photographs', 'la', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'series', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'also', 'tinted', 'photographs', 'style', 'favor', '1860s', 'infusing', 'morbid', 'subject', 'subtle', 'haunting', 'sense', 'life', 'Additionally', 'photographs', 'Victorian', 'period', 'frames', 'placing', 'table', 'tops', 'oil', 'lamps', 'family', 'Bibles', 'darkened', 'domestic', 'interiors', 'shot', 'color', 'film', 'dramatic', 'device', 'serves', 'remind', 'viewers', 'deaths', 'came', 'home', 'even', 'bodies', 'often', 'did', 'not', 'parlor', 'table', 'became', 'memorial', 'fallen', 'vanished', 'soldier.Appropriately', 'most', 'interviewees', 'speak', 'soft', 'almost', 'hushed', 'voices', 'including', 'Harvard', 'Historian', 'Drew', 'Gilpin', 'Faust', 'book', 'Republic', 'Suffering', 'was', 'basis', 'film', 'voices', 'wives', 'mothers', 'North', 'South', 'are', 'heard', 'are', 'tinged', 'anguish', 'mourning', 'actors', 'are', 'reading', 'memoirs', 'letters', 'era', 'somber', 'gripping', 'opening', 'D', 'tCW', 'dying', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'letter', 'quaveringly', 'voiced', 'farewell', 'Mississippi', 'family', 'camera', 'down', 'actual', 'candlelit', 'letter', 'see', 'faltering', 'penmanship', 'soldier', 'must', 'have', 'struggled', 'complete', 'letter', 'life', 'slipped', 'away.Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'stunned', 'learn', 'amount', 'bodies', 'left', 'battlefields', 'hastily', 'buried', 'abandoned', 'rot', 'federal', 'program', 'reclaim', 'bodies', 'honorable', 'dignified', 'burial', 'lasted', '2', 'years', 'war', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'quickly', 'bitter', 'Southerners', 'lands', 'cities', 'were', 'laid', 'waste', 'often', 'desecrated', 'bodies', 'Union', 'dead', 'federal', 'recovery/burial', 'program', 'ignored', 'interment', 'Confederate', 'fallen', 'private', 'societies', 'Southern', 'ladies', 'were', 'formed', 'ventured', 'battlefields', 'Gettysburg', 'reclaim', 'bury', 'dead', 'rescuing', 'remains', 'Northern', 'antipathy', 'result', 'Union', 'Confederate', 'were', 'buried', 'separate', 'cemeteries', 'reinforcing', 'national', 'division', 'efforts', 'lasted', '1870s.For', 'additional', 'information', 'Americans', 'responses', 'deaths', 'loved', 'ones', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'well', 'culture', 'war', 'produced', 'see', 'also', 'Republic', 'Suffering', 'Death', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Vintage', 'Civil', 'War', 'Library', 'Altar', 'Nation', 'Moral', 'History', 'Civil', 'WarAnd', 'Civil', 'War', 'time', 'used', 'contemporary', 'society', 'especially', 'South', 'see', 'Tony', 'Horwitz', 'moving', 'humorous', 'account', 'Confederates', 'Attic', 'Dispatches', 'Unfinished', 'Civil', 'War']",N/A

As the war dragged on and battle after battle producing thousands of dead soldiers that had to be dealt with Americans came to see and deal with death in a whole new way.

Its' main point however seemed to me to be the role of the Civil War as the catalyst for national military cemeteries, casualty identification and recovery of remains, and the notification of next of kin---none of which was existent before the war. It speaks of the traditional role of the family in caring for the remains of their dead (including battlefield recovery of remains) and the change from that model of death as a private family matter to the current systems in place for the care and honor of the dead and their families. This is especially relevant to the first-settled areas of the nation, north and south, with the small family burying grounds, and even the construction of houses with &#34;coffin doors&#34; (narrow but double front doors swinging outward which were so built in order to permit removal of the casket from the house to the burying ground).",4,Death and its' innovations!,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,989,"['film', 'great', 'many', 'very', 'deeply', 'distressing', 'graphic', 'pictures', 'battlefield', 'dead', 'bloody', 'letters', 'home', 'main', 'point', 'however', 'seemed', 'be', 'role', 'Civil', 'War', 'catalyst', 'national', 'military', 'cemeteries', 'casualty', 'identification', 'recovery', 'remains', 'notification', 'next', 'kin', '-none', 'was', 'existent', 'war', 'traditional', 'role', 'family', 'caring', 'remains', 'dead', 'including', 'battlefield', 'recovery', 'remains', 'change', 'model', 'death', 'private', 'family', 'matter', 'current', 'systems', 'place', 'care', 'honor', 'dead', 'families', 'especially', 'relevant', 'first-settled', 'areas', 'nation', 'north', 'south', 'small', 'family', 'burying', 'grounds', 'even', 'construction', 'houses', '34', 'coffin', 'doors', '34', 'narrow', 'double', 'front', 'doors', 'swinging', 'outward', 'were', 'so', 'built', 'order', 'permit', 'removal', 'casket', 'house', 'burying', 'ground']",N/A

Over and over we hear how the United States invaded the Confederate States to free the slaves. Not quite sure how that fits into the theme of this program. Maybe writer and director Ric Burns isn't sure either, but if you invade another country and kill 750,000 men, you do need a good reason. Even if that maybe wasn't the reason. Ric, next time, ask a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans to help you with a balanced approach.Let's squeeze a whole 4 million dollars out of the Federal budget to set up a National Cemetery system to bury the dead of the most costly war in all American history, but let's not bury any of the Southern dead.
