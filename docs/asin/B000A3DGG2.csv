I love the ab segment, and the fat blast is intense with burpees. I rarely do the basic training set because it's an intro to kickboxing and doesnt do much for my body anymore. I have toned up massively just from this, but to take it the next level i'm looking for new workouts. Keli's awesome I love her accent and how she makes the workout a lot of fun.

It's probably not for beginners because she doesn't take much time explaining the moves.  Some complain about the warm-ups in each section and that it's not long enough.  Don't buy this product if you don't want quick 10-minute workouts.  When I want to do more than one, I just fast forward through the extra warm-ups and cool downs.  The Basic Training section is fairly simple but a good sweaty workout.  Be warned - the fat burning blast is a serious butt-kicking workout.  I felt more like I was training to play football than kickboxing, but I really enjoyed it.  I never knew a 10 minute workout could be so tough.  I consider myself an intermediate excerciser and I almost couldn't finish the first time.  This DVD is almost worth it just for that section.  The abs section is also really great.  I liked the instructor as well.  She's no-nonsense and spends most of her time cueing for the next move and doesn't really give unnecessary chatter.

This is definitely an intermediate workout, but you can make it more challenging by putting more into it.  I love it because I am new to kickboxing and needed a bit of a tutorial.

920134,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B000A3DGG2,Chandler,"[15, 16]","I workout to a collection of over 100 dvds and rotate them...it's cheaper than a gym and I get an incredible workout at home with some of the best instructors.  Because of this, I'm very picky about which dvds I keep and which I donate to charity when I buy a new one.This one is a definite keeper!Cueing: The instructor is beyond reproach in her cueing in my opinion. I'm shocked to see someone else say otherwise because that's my biggest beef in a workout dvd...I can't even do most of the Firm videos without getting tripped up. However, this one offered great cueing and I kept up easily.Music: The music was good and went to the exact tempo of the moves.energy: The energy was good and it was fast paced.  There was only one participant in the instruction rather than an instructor with a group.  I tend to like a group for visual interest but this was no problem at all.Caloric expenditure measurement: That said, I wear a bodybugg (aka gowear fit) every day to measure my daily caloric expenditure. Because of this, I also know the exact number of calories every workout burns. I only mention this so you know it was measured not in perceived exertion but scientifically. and, quite frankly, although it was a great workout, it burned the same number of calories in 10 minutes that most of my other fitness dvds did; the exact number burned in my Biggest Loser dvds for example. If you have very little time and need to squeeze in a workout it is better than nothing, but it shouldn't be expected that you'll burn as much in ten minutes equal to a 20 or 30 minute dvd.  I typically do this dvd in two parts...the first basic training and the fat burning section. However, the full 20 minute set does offer good caloric burn but to meet the daily caloric burn I set for myself based on what my good dvds burn, I still need to add on 10-15 minutes on the elliptical.Most caloric burn: The basic training section burned the most calories with its kickboxing moves...so if you have one section you pick to do this should be it. I've found kickboxing to offer excellent caloric burn on many dvds.Joint issues?:the fat burning section is good too but if you have joint issues it may be tough...there was slightly too much up and down floor work for me. Meaning that you go from standing up to down, to push ups to up again then again about 4 more times then do it with lifting a leg...down up down up...however, these moves help burn calories so I dont fault the dvd for them and I do not have joint issues but someone who does may want to skip this section and simply do the basic training and the abs for example.Strength and cardio: The dvd works the total body with stregth and cardio so, while it may be equal to caloric burn of other dvds, if you add in any section with strength training moves you'll continue to burn calories after the workout...just as any strength training dvd does. (cardio burns more calories during the workout but strength continues a caloric burning boost up to 24 hours later.)Conclusion: It's an excellent dvd for a time crunch but for a full workout, you will want to do 30-35 min of it to equal other fitness dvd's caloric burn according to my bodybugg caloric measurement but it's a joy to do with fast-paced and energetic moves and most assuredly a ""keeper"".Alternatives: I also enjoy Women's Health ""Total Workout in Ten"" for high caloric burn in ten minutes but Jillian of the Biggest Loser has some real calorie scorchers, such as ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" that also use kickboxing when you have more time and also offer great cueing and instruction.",4,"Easy to follow (and I have no coordination at all), good energy, good cueing,  but 10 min caloric burn doesn't exceed other dvds",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,3598,"['workout', 'collection', '100', 'dvds', 'rotate', 'cheaper', 'gym', 'get', 'incredible', 'workout', 'home', 'best', 'instructors', ""'m"", 'very', 'picky', 'dvds', 'keep', 'donate', 'charity', 'when', 'buy', 'new', 'one.This', 'one', 'definite', 'keeper', 'Cueing', 'instructor', 'reproach', 'cueing', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'say', 'otherwise', 'biggest', 'beef', 'workout', 'dvd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'most', 'Firm', 'videos', 'getting', 'tripped', 'up', 'However', 'one', 'offered', 'great', 'cueing', 'kept', 'up', 'easily.Music', 'music', 'was', 'good', 'went', 'exact', 'tempo', 'moves.energy', 'energy', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'participant', 'instruction', 'rather', 'instructor', 'group', 'tend', 'like', 'group', 'visual', 'interest', 'was', 'problem', 'all.Caloric', 'expenditure', 'measurement', 'said', 'wear', 'bodybugg', 'aka', 'gowear', 'fit', 'day', 'measure', 'daily', 'caloric', 'expenditure', 'also', 'know', 'exact', 'number', 'calories', 'workout', 'burns', 'only', 'mention', 'so', 'know', 'was', 'measured', 'not', 'perceived', 'exertion', 'scientifically', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'great', 'workout', 'burned', 'same', 'number', 'calories', '10', 'minutes', 'most', 'other', 'fitness', 'dvds', 'did', 'exact', 'number', 'burned', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'dvds', 'example', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'need', 'squeeze', 'workout', 'better', 'nothing', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'as', 'much', 'ten', 'minutes', 'equal', '20', '30', 'minute', 'dvd', 'typically', 'do', 'dvd', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'basic', 'training', 'fat', 'burning', 'section', 'However', 'full', '20', 'minute', 'set', 'offer', 'good', 'caloric', 'burn', 'meet', 'daily', 'caloric', 'burn', 'set', 'based', 'what', 'good', 'dvds', 'burn', 'still', 'need', 'add', '10-15', 'minutes', 'elliptical.Most', 'caloric', 'burn', 'basic', 'training', 'section', 'burned', 'most', 'calories', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'so', 'have', 'one', 'section', 'pick', 'do', 'should', 'be', ""'ve"", 'found', 'kickboxing', 'offer', 'excellent', 'caloric', 'burn', 'many', 'dvds.Joint', 'issues', 'fat', 'burning', 'section', 'good', 'too', 'have', 'joint', 'issues', 'may', 'be', 'tough', 'was', 'slightly', 'too', 'much', 'floor', 'work', 'Meaning', 'go', 'standing', 'up', 'down', 'push', 'ups', 'up', 'again', 'then', 'again', '4', 'more', 'times', 'then', 'do', 'lifting', 'leg', 'down', 'up', 'down', 'up', 'however', 'moves', 'help', 'burn', 'calories', 'dont', 'dvd', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'joint', 'issues', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'section', 'simply', 'do', 'basic', 'training', 'abs', 'example.Strength', 'cardio', 'dvd', 'total', 'body', 'stregth', 'cardio', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'equal', 'caloric', 'burn', 'other', 'dvds', 'add', 'section', 'strength', 'training', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'burn', 'calories', 'workout', 'just', 'strength', 'training', 'dvd', 'cardio', 'burns', 'more', 'calories', 'workout', 'strength', 'caloric', 'burning', 'boost', '24', 'hours', 'later', 'Conclusion', 'excellent', 'dvd', 'time', 'crunch', 'full', 'workout', 'will', 'want', 'do', '30-35', 'min', 'equal', 'other', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'caloric', 'burn', 'according', 'bodybugg', 'caloric', 'measurement', 'joy', 'do', 'fast-paced', 'energetic', 'moves', 'most', 'assuredly', 'keeper', '.Alternatives', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Women', 'Health', 'Total', 'Workout', 'Ten', 'high', 'caloric', 'burn', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Jillian', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'real', 'calorie', 'scorchers', 'such', 'Banish', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'also', 'use', 'kickboxing', 'when', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'also', 'offer', 'great', 'cueing', 'instruction']",N/A

Even though I think this workout is more appropriate for intermediate-advanced, I would still recommend this for beginners if they are willing to do the motions slower or with smaller range of motion, because at least it is a DVD that can grow with you...as you get stronger you can use the workout programing feature to do more sections at a time.The ""Basic Training"" & ""Arms"" section had the most kick/boxing style moves, the rest of the sections were mostly standard exercises or jumping around ""bootcamp"" style.BASIC TRAINING:I thought this would be a cheesy warm up, but it is actually is a workout that worked up a sweat.  In this segment she introduces the basic types of punches and kicks, but does it in a way where you keep your whole body jumping around constantly for the 10minutes, so my heart was pumping and surprisingly  felt pretty tired afterwards.LEGSThis is a tough workout.  She does several of the same moves in a row but varies the routine by changing the depth to which you do each movement,  and the last few variations are done with a kick included:  squats, front lunges, lateral lunges, squats, roundhouse kick.This segment is very hard on the knees (& back) - if you have bad knees or are out of shape you might want to skip this section or just do very small range of motion.ARMSStarts with a short warm-up section with legs doing a step-touch and arms swinging/stretching in various directions.Then she does the following with weights:Triceps kickback(with mini-lunges), shoulder extension, bicep curls(with mini-lunges).Karate punch forward, Jab & cross.  Hook & Cross.  (beginners shouldn't use weights on the punching moves, cause you could hurt your shoulder if you're not used to the motions)FAT BURNING BLASTThis is a bootcamp style workout with a combo of jump downs, lunges, squats, push ups, leg lifts while in push up position, hopping around, side punches, Ends with 1 min of stretches.ABSOverall the exercises are great, but I felt there weren't enough reps to really make the muscles tired.It starts with a cheesy back stretch.Then goes into a fantastic ""Elbow Plank Sequence"":*Lay on side propped on elbow and with bottom knee bent on the floor,  then kick out top leg while lifting body off the floor (this really burns the sides of your butt).*Arms on elbows with body in knee-push-up like position, then straighten legs off the floor.Then side oblique crunch, regular crunch, reverse crunch.Then double & single leg stretch (pilates style move that works lower abs and hip flexors)General body stretching.",5,Recommended for intermediate/advanced.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,2765,"['Instructor', 'very', 'energetic', 'good', 'verbal', 'cues.I', 'found', 'workout', 'be', 'tough', 'overall', 'beginners', 'will', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'keeping', 'up', 'tempo', 'moves', 'doing', 'several', 'segments', 'time', 'Even', 'think', 'workout', 'more', 'appropriate', 'intermediate-advanced', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'motions', 'slower', 'smaller', 'range', 'motion', 'least', 'DVD', 'can', 'grow', 'get', 'stronger', 'can', 'use', 'workout', 'programing', 'feature', 'do', 'more', 'sections', 'time.The', 'Basic', 'Training', 'Arms', 'section', 'had', 'most', 'kick/boxing', 'style', 'moves', 'rest', 'sections', 'were', 'mostly', 'standard', 'exercises', 'jumping', 'bootcamp', 'style.BASIC', 'TRAINING', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cheesy', 'warm', 'up', 'actually', 'workout', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'segment', 'basic', 'types', 'punches', 'kicks', 'way', 'where', 'keep', 'whole', 'body', 'jumping', 'around', 'constantly', '10minutes', 'heart', 'was', 'pumping', 'surprisingly', 'felt', 'pretty', 'tired', 'afterwards.LEGSThis', 'tough', 'workout', 'several', 'same', 'moves', 'row', 'routine', 'changing', 'depth', 'do', 'movement', 'last', 'few', 'variations', 'are', 'done', 'kick', 'included', 'squats', 'front', 'lunges', 'lateral', 'lunges', 'squats', 'roundhouse', 'kick.This', 'segment', 'very', 'hard', 'knees', 'back', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'are', 'shape', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'section', 'just', 'do', 'very', 'small', 'range', 'motion.ARMSStarts', 'short', 'warm-up', 'section', 'legs', 'doing', 'step-touch', 'arms', 'swinging/stretching', 'various', 'directions.Then', 'following', 'weights', 'Triceps', 'kickback', 'mini-lunges', 'shoulder', 'extension', 'bicep', 'curls', 'mini-lunges', '.Karate', 'punch', 'forward', 'Jab', 'cross', 'Hook', 'Cross', 'beginners', 'should', ""n't"", 'use', 'weights', 'punching', 'moves', 'cause', 'could', 'hurt', 'shoulder', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'motions', 'FAT', 'BURNING', 'BLASTThis', 'bootcamp', 'style', 'workout', 'combo', 'jump', 'downs', 'lunges', 'squats', 'push', 'ups', 'leg', 'lifts', 'push', 'up', 'position', 'hopping', 'around', 'side', 'punches', '1', 'min', 'exercises', 'are', 'great', 'felt', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'reps', 'really', 'make', 'muscles', 'cheesy', 'back', 'stretch.Then', 'fantastic', 'Elbow', 'Plank', 'Sequence', '*Lay', 'side', 'propped', 'elbow', 'bottom', 'knee', 'bent', 'floor', 'then', 'kick', 'out', 'top', 'leg', 'lifting', 'body', 'floor', 'really', 'sides', 'butt', '*Arms', 'elbows', 'body', 'knee-push-up', 'position', 'then', 'straighten', 'legs', 'floor.Then', 'side', 'oblique', 'crunch', 'regular', 'crunch', 'reverse', 'crunch.Then', 'double', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'style', 'move', 'lower', 'abs', 'hip', 'flexors', 'General', 'body', 'stretching']",N/A

I can do a new work-out every time I use this dvd if I want to, or just pick a few and do it with another work-out dvd. The pace is pretty fast, and I would not suggest it for true beginners. I would list it as intermediate.Keli's arm sculpture segment is great and I also enjoy the bootcamp inspired segment. It will kick your butt!!!

This one is not for light exercise days, but in my case, I am looking to up the intensity of my workouts so it is perfect.  The exercises are not what you see typically see in workouts.  You use the weights with kickboxing moves in both the arms and legs sections.  Also, the abs section is more stabilization exercises than sit-ups.  They are hard to do, but I am finding that they are more effective right now than all of the same old crunches I do all of the time.

As always, Keli's cueing and explanations are thorough and fun.  Beginners to kick-boxing, as I am, will appreciate the detailed explanations of various kicks, punches and stances not provided on many work outs.  That said, there are some advanced moves on these work outs, such as the progressively difficult push-up sequence in the Fat Blasting segment, which may be one reason for the ""no alternative moves"" critique below.  For that, I suggest this approach: First, Don't underestimate yourself.  You CAN do push-ups, and these start out in the bent-knee position, which is easier on the body than full plank.  Second, don't OVERESTIMATE yourself, especially as Keli increases the difficulty.  If you reach a certain level and aren't ready to increase the difficulty, STAY WHERE YOU ARE.  The best way to ""modify"" an exercise is simply to keep going at the previous level, until you're comfortable moving up a notch.  The gradual ""adding on"" of layers in the push-up sequence makes this very easy to do.

920152,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000A3DGG2,Sheri in Reho,"[230, 232]","As with the other DVDs in the 10-Minute Solution series, Kickbox Bootcamp features five 10-minute workouts.  You can pick one for a quick 10-mintue blast, follow all five in sequence for a killer 50-minute routine, or mix and match them as you wish to get just the workout you want.  The 10-Minute Solution series is all about flexibility-one reason why I own several DVDs of the series.  The instructor on this DVD is Keli Roberts.  The five workouts, all with some element of kickboxing flavor, are:Basic Training:  This segment is basically ""Beginner Kickboxing""-a good starting point for people who haven't had much kickboxing experience; however, I still found it a great workout even though I have been doing kickboxing for about a year.  While teaching you the basic punches and kicks that will be used throughout the DVD, Keli keeps your heart rate up with faux jump roping, boxer shuffle, and other cardio moves.Ultimate Buns and Thighs:  This segment incorporates kicks into a lower body workout that includes lunges and plies.  The method Keli uses to teach kicking is quite simple and effective.  This was a good workout.  I didn't feel the burn as much as in the TamiLee Webb ""I Want Those Buns!"" workout, but then Keli doesn't use quite so much repetition and it therefore wasn't as hard on my knees.Arm and Shoulder Sculptor:  Here we switch to an upper body focus using light hand weights to get more benefit out of the punches.  I started with the 5-pound hand weights I use for at-home upper-body work, but had to switch to 2-pounders to keep up with Keli's fast pace.  She also does some quick punching sequences in between weight segments.  I really liked this workout and, from the look of Keli's upper body, I'd say she knows what she's doing!Fat-Burning Blast:  This segment definitely puts the ""Bootcamp"" in the title.  It begins (after the warm up) with a very difficult sequence-going from a stand to a squat to a plank (push-up position) to a squat to a stand over and over (and incorporating other-even more challenging-moves as the sequence progresses).  Once you get past that sequence, there is a series of lateral agility drills-sliding, jumping and stepping side to side.  By far, my least favorite of the DVD.Washboard Abs:  Keli definitely doesn't depend just on crunches here-she does planks, side work and a few Pilates moves as well as crunches to work out your obliques, upper and lower abs.  This is a good workout, and I didn't make it all the way through on the first try.  That's a good sign, though, because it gives me something to work toward.Pros:1.  Keli doesn't use the same tired moves as every one else-despite the MANY exercise DVDs I've tried, there were many new moves on this DVD and I loved that.2.  The warm-ups and cool-downs, while brief, are excellent and tailored to each workout.Cons:1.  There is almost no color contrast on the menu, so figuring out where the ""cursor"" is and which button you're selecting is very difficult.  I found this highly annoying.",4,Mix and match your way to kicking butt!,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,3018,"['other', 'DVDs', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'series', 'Kickbox', 'Bootcamp', 'five', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'can', 'pick', 'one', 'quick', '10-mintue', 'blast', 'follow', 'five', 'sequence', 'killer', '50-minute', 'routine', 'mix', 'match', 'wish', 'get', 'just', 'workout', 'want', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'series', 'flexibility-one', 'reason', 'why', 'own', 'several', 'DVDs', 'series', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'five', 'workouts', 'element', 'kickboxing', 'flavor', 'are', 'Basic', 'Training', 'segment', 'basically', 'Beginner', 'Kickboxing', '-a', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'kickboxing', 'experience', 'however', 'still', 'found', 'great', 'workout', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'kickboxing', 'year', 'teaching', 'basic', 'punches', 'kicks', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'DVD', 'Keli', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'faux', 'jump', 'roping', 'boxer', 'shuffle', 'other', 'cardio', 'moves.Ultimate', 'Buns', 'Thighs', 'segment', 'kicks', 'lower', 'body', 'lunges', 'plies', 'method', 'Keli', 'teach', 'kicking', 'quite', 'simple', 'effective', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'burn', 'as', 'much', 'TamiLee', 'Webb', 'Want', 'Buns', 'workout', 'then', 'Keli', ""n't"", 'use', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'repetition', 'therefore', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'hard', 'knees.Arm', 'Shoulder', 'Sculptor', 'Here', 'switch', 'upper', 'body', 'focus', 'using', 'light', 'hand', 'weights', 'get', 'more', 'benefit', 'punches', 'started', '5-pound', 'hand', 'weights', 'use', 'at-home', 'upper-body', 'work', 'had', 'switch', '2-pounders', 'keep', 'up', 'Keli', 'fast', 'pace', 'also', 'quick', 'punching', 'sequences', 'weight', 'segments', 'really', 'liked', 'workout', 'look', 'Keli', 'upper', 'body', ""'d"", 'say', 'what', 'doing', 'Fat-Burning', 'Blast', 'segment', 'definitely', 'Bootcamp', 'title', 'warm', 'up', 'very', 'difficult', 'sequence-going', 'stand', 'squat', 'plank', 'push-up', 'position', 'squat', 'stand', 'incorporating', 'other-even', 'more', 'challenging-moves', 'sequence', 'Once', 'get', 'sequence', 'series', 'lateral', 'agility', 'drills-sliding', 'jumping', 'stepping', 'side', 'side', 'far', 'least', 'favorite', 'DVD.Washboard', 'Abs', 'Keli', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'depend', 'just', 'crunches', 'here-she', 'planks', 'side', 'work', 'few', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'crunches', 'work', 'out', 'obliques', 'upper', 'lower', 'abs', 'good', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'way', 'first', 'try', 'good', 'sign', 'though', 'something', 'work', 'toward.Pros:1', 'Keli', ""n't"", 'use', 'same', 'tired', 'moves', 'one', 'else-despite', 'MANY', 'exercise', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'were', 'many', 'new', 'moves', 'DVD', 'loved', 'that.2', 'warm-ups', 'cool-downs', 'brief', 'are', 'excellent', 'tailored', 'workout.Cons:1', 'almost', 'color', 'contrast', 'menu', 'so', 'figuring', 'out', 'where', 'cursor', 'button', ""'re"", 'selecting', 'very', 'difficult', 'found', 'highly', 'annoying']",N/A
