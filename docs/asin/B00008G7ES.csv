741739,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00008G7ES,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 1]","Berserk is, and forever will be, one of the darkest anime ever created. Blood is so common it may as well be considered a main character. The themes of the anime, killing, destruction, hatred, vengeance, torture, are no where else except maximum security prisons. And it's volume six that solidifies these themes so vividly.In volume six, Guts and the remaining members of the Band of the Hawk make their way to the castle to rescue Griffith. But, upon finding him, or what's left of him, the once hopeful band is now distraught and leaderless, and talking about disbanding to seek their own separate ways of living. What they do not realize, however, is just how affected, and infected, Griffith has become. His own hunger for vengeance and hatred has twisted his mind to match his gnarled body, and he wants only to be let out of this world, one way or another. He finds his solution in the mysterious charm he wore for the entire series and calls upon four demonic creatures, all god-like in power, and their minions to solve his current problem.What he asks of them is dreadful, and the final conclusion is as painful to watch as anything I've ever seen in any anime, or any other form of entertainment, to date. Murder and rape fill the final episode to bursting. For a long time, Guts was the anti-hero of the story, that savage killer we couldn't help but cheer for simply because he was the main character and the man we were forced to follow. By the end of this series, the old Guts looks like an angel compared to what Griffith becomes. In the last moments of the series, we see what is left of Guts (which can be seen in the beginning episode of the series) as he sets out to get revenge for all the companions and friends he lost.This volume finally ties the itself to the first episode. In many ways, the entire series, from episode two to twenty-five, was simply a prequel to episode one. We are brought along with Guts in his early journey so that we know and understand what drives him, and how he attains the many scars he carries, both physically and mentally. We learn about the bleeding brand on his neck, and the significance of the charm both Griffith and the snake demon carry. Though difficult to watch at times, this is an excellent wrap up to the first season of one the best fantasy anime ever created.",5,"Dark Fantasy, Final",1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,2329,"['Berserk', 'forever', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'darkest', 'anime', 'ever', 'created', 'Blood', 'so', 'common', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'considered', 'main', 'character', 'themes', 'anime', 'killing', 'destruction', 'hatred', 'vengeance', 'torture', 'are', 'where', 'else', 'maximum', 'security', 'prisons', 'volume', 'six', 'themes', 'so', 'vividly.In', 'volume', 'six', 'Guts', 'remaining', 'members', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'make', 'way', 'castle', 'rescue', 'Griffith', 'finding', 'what', 'left', 'once', 'hopeful', 'band', 'now', 'distraught', 'leaderless', 'talking', 'disbanding', 'seek', 'own', 'separate', 'ways', 'living', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'however', 'just', 'how', 'affected', 'infected', 'Griffith', 'become', 'own', 'hunger', 'vengeance', 'hatred', 'twisted', 'mind', 'match', 'gnarled', 'body', 'only', 'be', 'let', 'world', 'one', 'way', 'solution', 'mysterious', 'charm', 'wore', 'entire', 'series', 'four', 'demonic', 'creatures', 'god-like', 'power', 'minions', 'solve', 'current', 'dreadful', 'final', 'conclusion', 'as', 'painful', 'watch', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'other', 'form', 'entertainment', 'date', 'Murder', 'rape', 'fill', 'final', 'episode', 'bursting', 'long', 'time', 'Guts', 'was', 'anti-hero', 'story', 'savage', 'killer', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'simply', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'man', 'were', 'forced', 'follow', 'end', 'series', 'old', 'Guts', 'angel', 'compared', 'what', 'Griffith', 'last', 'moments', 'series', 'see', 'what', 'left', 'Guts', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'beginning', 'episode', 'series', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'companions', 'friends', 'lost.This', 'volume', 'finally', 'first', 'episode', 'many', 'ways', 'entire', 'series', 'episode', 'two', 'twenty-five', 'was', 'simply', 'prequel', 'episode', 'one', 'are', 'brought', 'Guts', 'early', 'journey', 'know', 'understand', 'how', 'many', 'scars', 'physically', 'mentally', 'learn', 'bleeding', 'brand', 'neck', 'significance', 'charm', 'Griffith', 'snake', 'demon', 'carry', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'excellent', 'wrap', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'ever', 'created']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25

Here the show takes a big leap into the macabre and dark with hardcore horror elements mixed with the supernatural.  Unfortunately, it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger which is extremely maddening and upsetting (hence the rating).  Still, good stuff if you don't mind reading the manga to see how the Eclipse resolves.

741741,A1IPP4XVTCMSV8,B00008G7ES,"Christopher Bailey ""pcboy56""","[0, 1]","I'd assume that if you're thinking of picking up the final DVD of this series, you've already watched what's come before and can't wait for the conclusion.  So, I probably won't say much to change your mind at this point.  That said, if you want to find out that ultimate conclusion, you will have to also be willing to delve into the Berserk manga.  (Available here on Amazon....)Now, about this DVD itself...it's tremendous.  Save for the ending which may disappoint some, this is an awe-inspiring cap to the anime.  Take everything great about this series: the characters, plot, darkness, action, everything and rest assured that this final set of episodes does all of those same things to perfection.  The entire DVD is probably the most stunning, visually memorable portrait of hell that I've ever witnessed, and provided you're mature enough to handle it, I'd heartily recommend checking it out.Unfortunately, they decided to end this series pretty much in the midst of the action, and that can really put a bad taste in your mouth if you're expecting things to wrap up nicely.  Think of this as another chapter in Guts' saga rather than the end and you may enjoy it more.  You can put together a lot of the missing pieces by watching the first episode over again and making the connections, but that really isn't fair to yourself or this fantastic series.  Do yourself a favor and find a way to pick up the manga.  I love this entire series, and having just watched this final DVD, I absolutely will be purchasing the manga to find out the conclusion.Despite the lack of a solid conclusion, I am awe-inspired by this DVD and happy to have purchased it.",5,"Jaw-dropping plot, but ending isn't for everyone",1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,1659,"[""'d"", 'assume', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'picking', 'up', 'final', 'DVD', 'series', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'what', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'conclusion', 'So', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'change', 'mind', 'point', 'said', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'will', 'have', 'also', 'be', 'willing', 'delve', 'Berserk', 'manga', 'Available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Now', 'DVD', 'tremendous', 'Save', 'ending', 'may', 'disappoint', 'awe-inspiring', 'cap', 'anime', 'Take', 'everything', 'great', 'series', 'characters', 'plot', 'darkness', 'action', 'everything', 'rest', 'assured', 'final', 'set', 'episodes', 'same', 'things', 'perfection', 'entire', 'DVD', 'probably', 'most', 'stunning', 'visually', 'memorable', 'portrait', 'hell', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'provided', ""'re"", 'mature', 'enough', 'handle', ""'d"", 'heartily', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out.Unfortunately', 'decided', 'end', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'midst', 'action', 'can', 'really', 'put', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'things', 'wrap', 'up', 'nicely', 'Think', 'chapter', 'Guts', 'saga', 'rather', 'end', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'lot', 'missing', 'pieces', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'again', 'making', 'connections', 'really', ""n't"", 'fair', 'yourself', 'fantastic', 'series', 'Do', 'favor', 'find', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'manga', 'love', 'entire', 'series', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'final', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'manga', 'find', 'out', 'conclusion.Despite', 'lack', 'solid', 'conclusion', 'am', 'awe-inspired', 'DVD', 'happy', 'have', 'purchased']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25

741743,AL48Y1OYJZIJ5,B00008G7ES,"Fates Puppet ""lifespuppet""","[2, 4]","Having never read the originating manga for this series, I can only rate this DVD against previous ones.  This series, up to this point, was outstanding.  The interplay of characters and the discussions about dreams and their influence on lives is amazing.  Beyond the mere swordplay and violence, this series carried with it the soul of a profound and wonderful story.  However, this all changed in this volume.I gave this DVD 3 stars because the first 2 episodes continue the engaging story of Guts and the Hawks, but the last 2 episodes all but destroy the series in my opinion.  The hints of magic and the supernatural have been very slim in the earlier volumes, and they help to pull the viewer in.  They all but promise a very interesting turn of events in the near future.  Unfortunately, this turn is pulled off in a very poor fashion that doesn't live up to the rest of the series.These last 2 episodes butcher a wonderful story, and the last left me with a feeling of betrayal.  It is almost as if the creators couldn't think of a way to neatly end the series.  Without giving anything away, I will say that this ranks up there with the last episode of the Evangelion series as one of my worst all time let downs.  I wasn't expecting some cataclysmic battle to end all battles, just something that lived up to the rest of the series.  In this case, a cliff-hanger would have been infinitely more preferable.As far as the DVD itself, there is no shortage of extras.  The normal outtakes are accompanied by an interesting painting video as well as several other short bits, and as always, there are previews for other series.  In my opinion, any fan of this series should see this DVD, if only to understand how good the rest of the series is.  This series could have been one of the greatest of all time, and though it is wonderful, its ending all but destroyed its beauty.",3,Poor Ending to a Great Series,1056499200,"06 25, 2003",2003,1882,"['Having', 'never', 'read', 'originating', 'manga', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'rate', 'DVD', 'previous', 'ones', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'outstanding', 'interplay', 'characters', 'discussions', 'dreams', 'influence', 'lives', 'amazing', 'mere', 'swordplay', 'violence', 'series', 'carried', 'soul', 'profound', 'wonderful', 'story', 'However', 'changed', 'volume.I', 'gave', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'continue', 'engaging', 'story', 'Guts', 'Hawks', 'last', '2', 'destroy', 'series', 'opinion', 'hints', 'magic', 'supernatural', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'slim', 'earlier', 'volumes', 'help', 'pull', 'viewer', 'promise', 'very', 'interesting', 'turn', 'events', 'near', 'future', 'Unfortunately', 'turn', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'poor', 'fashion', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'rest', 'series.These', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'butcher', 'wonderful', 'story', 'last', 'left', 'feeling', 'betrayal', 'almost', 'creators', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'neatly', 'end', 'series', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'up', 'there', 'last', 'episode', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'one', 'worst', 'time', 'let', 'downs', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'cataclysmic', 'battle', 'end', 'battles', 'just', 'something', 'lived', 'up', 'rest', 'series', 'case', 'cliff-hanger', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'infinitely', 'more', 'preferable.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'shortage', 'extras', 'normal', 'outtakes', 'are', 'accompanied', 'interesting', 'painting', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'other', 'short', 'bits', 'always', 'are', 'previews', 'other', 'series', 'opinion', 'fan', 'series', 'should', 'see', 'DVD', 'only', 'understand', 'how', 'good', 'rest', 'series', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'time', 'wonderful', 'ending', 'destroyed', 'beauty']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25

WHAT THE HELL!!! why in the world would you end a series with Caska being raped!!! i was so captivated, then all of a sudden the credits roll and i'm like ""thats it""!!! this is not to say that the episodes aren't good, they are excellent and pulse pounding but to end it with no conclusion or climax is ridiculous!!! THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THE FIRST EPISODE THE LAST EPISODE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SINCE THE SERIES IS A FLASHBACK ANYWAY!!! think about it, we see caska getting raped then Gutts screams and we fade out, to wake up to guts forging his new sword out to destroy demons. then the series ends with gutts cutting the demon servent in half and walking into the flames. BAM! THE PERFECT ENDING RIGHT? why in the hell did they make the first episode the aftermath of the last?!! who in the hell thought it be a good idea to have the final image being caska being raped?!if you are planning on watching this series SAVE THE FIRST EPISODE FOR THE CONCLUSION, I BEG YOU!!!! SKIP THE FIRST EPISODE PLEASE!!! YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING AND YOU'LL THANK ME ONCE YOU COME TO THE LAST EPISODE AND IMMEDIATELY FEEL THE URGE TO POP IN THAT FIRST EPISODE AND SEE WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!!!

The anime that you can purchase, is actually volumes 3-13 in the Manga. The anime is great and does a good job following the manga for the most part. The only thing that is a let down is that they never finished animating this manga. Currently the manga is up to volume 24 with 25 to be relaesed this fall hopefully.If you liked the other discs, then you will want to pick this up. Just be warned that the series ends on a huge cliff hanger that is not resolved unless you start reading the manga (which btw just got licensed by dark horse comics and we should see the first installments this fall).Now for those that have no idea what this story is about...The series follows Guts(Gatts whatever) who was born to a corpse and was found by a band of mercenaries that raised him.

Hopefully the reader will forgive me if I veer too close.  Certainly, the series has been building to an apocalyptic ending, but the signs and indicators were in early episodes, and Director Takahashi has hidden them beneath layers of political infighting and battlefield mayhem.  Now, with the great eclipse in the offing, the real story returns with a vengeance.The previous DVD closed with Griffith under the hand of a torturer and Guts and Caska plotting to free him so that the Hawks can return to their former glory.  They succeed, but it is a bitter victory.  They are too late.  The Griffith they bring back is a mad mind in a ruined body, bereft even of the ability to speak.  From there on, things fall apart.But not in a blaze of glorious battle, as one might expect.  As the sun disappears in eclipse, a red dawn arises, greeting the coming of Griffith's true destiny with the sacrifice of everything he cared about.  A bleak and unresolved destiny created at the hands of the minions of hell.The viewer should be warned that the end of the TV series does not represent the actual end of the 'Berserk' story line.  Takahashi determined to stop with the events of the eclipse out of a sense of timing.  Miura's manga series is still ongoing.  Given the surprise success of the series, there is hope for a follow up that will bring the story into its post-apocalyptic phase.In a sense, 'Berserk' is every bit as much of an experiment as 'Lain' is.  The kind of content brought to the TV series is normally reserved for the OVA market, and the use of quality production values is outstanding.

741748,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00008G7ES,Michael Crane,"[6, 7]","Well, I have finished the ""Berserk"" series, and it was quite a journey.  I'm a little saddened that this series really has no concrete conclusion and leaves the viewers hanging, possibly because this is only the beginning of the story.  If I had known that from the beginning, it would've made the last two episodes a little better for me.  Still, I'm overall pretty pleased with this dark and violent epic and hope that the series will continue on.  ""Berserk 6: God's Hand"" is the conclusion to this first series, but not to the story.Guts and The Band of the Hawk stage a rescue to recover a very beaten and tattered Griffith from the kingdom's dungeon.  He has lost his sanity and his mind as he has completely given himself into the darkness.  It is here after they rescue him that the true horrific fate of Griffith comes to light as The Great Eclipse is present.  All hope and all that once was seems to end in the last two episodes.  This saga in whole reveals the story of how Guts came to be, but has only touched the surface of his ultimate quest and purpose.I really enjoyed watching the series and am glad that I invested my time into it.  However, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a tad disappointed with the conclusion.  The ending felt more like a teaser to me than anything else.  I know now that I will definitely invest my time should a second series (and there better be with the way things ended) be released.  It's still an amazing anime epic that ventures into bloodshed and darkness.This anime series is in no way intended for younger viewers, especially these last four episodes.  They contain strong and brutal violence, extreme blood and gore, nudity, a brief scene of rape, nudity, language, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  Extras included are trailers, outtakes, a TV spot and more.In no way am I disappointed with ""Berserk"" as a whole, but it is sad to see that there is no concrete ending for this first series.  ""Berserk 6: God's Hand"" tends to leave more questions than answers, but it is still necessary to the series.  These 25 episodes have been quite the journey.  Just be willing to accept that you're not going to get an open-and-shut ending--and whatever you do, do not expect a happy ending.  Then again, maybe this was suspected all along.  Still a very exciting and intense saga that was time well spent.",4,"Darkness, Bloody Darkness...",1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,2363,"['Well', 'have', 'finished', 'Berserk', 'series', 'was', 'quite', 'journey', ""'m"", 'little', 'saddened', 'series', 'really', 'concrete', 'conclusion', 'viewers', 'hanging', 'possibly', 'only', 'beginning', 'story', 'had', 'known', 'beginning', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'last', 'two', 'little', 'better', 'Still', ""'m"", 'overall', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'dark', 'violent', 'epic', 'hope', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'Berserk', '6', 'God', 'Hand', 'conclusion', 'first', 'series', 'not', 'story.Guts', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'stage', 'rescue', 'recover', 'very', 'beaten', 'tattered', 'Griffith', 'kingdom', 'dungeon', 'lost', 'sanity', 'mind', 'completely', 'given', 'darkness', 'here', 'rescue', 'true', 'horrific', 'fate', 'Griffith', 'light', 'Great', 'Eclipse', 'present', 'hope', 'once', 'was', 'end', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'saga', 'whole', 'reveals', 'story', 'how', 'Guts', 'came', 'be', 'only', 'touched', 'surface', 'ultimate', 'quest', 'purpose.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'series', 'am', 'glad', 'invested', 'time', 'However', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'tad', 'disappointed', 'conclusion', 'ending', 'felt', 'more', 'teaser', 'anything', 'else', 'know', 'now', 'will', 'definitely', 'invest', 'time', 'should', 'second', 'series', 'better', 'be', 'way', 'things', 'ended', 'be', 'released', 'still', 'amazing', 'anime', 'epic', 'ventures', 'bloodshed', 'darkness.This', 'anime', 'series', 'way', 'intended', 'younger', 'viewers', 'especially', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'contain', 'strong', 'brutal', 'violence', 'extreme', 'blood', 'gore', 'nudity', 'brief', 'scene', 'rape', 'nudity', 'language', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'themes', 'imagery', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'trailers', 'outtakes', 'TV', 'spot', 'more.In', 'way', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Berserk', 'whole', 'sad', 'see', 'concrete', 'ending', 'first', 'series', 'Berserk', '6', 'God', 'Hand', 'leave', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'still', 'necessary', 'series', '25', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'journey', 'Just', 'be', 'willing', 'accept', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'open-and-shut', 'ending', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'was', 'suspected', 'along', 'Still', 'very', 'exciting', 'intense', 'saga', 'was', 'time', 'well', 'spent']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25

Not Only are you left with a huge cliffhanger but It's so darn sad.All the characters you've grown to love,Juedoe,Pipin,Corkus(yeah),and the hawks are killed one by one by Grotesque and some what messed up demons.  Just lookin' at em' they look messed up.Sadly we also see why Guts needs his sword.  With out it he's no more then dead just like the rest of the Hawks.  This set Episodes may be the most Important of them all.We also see our once loved Griffith turned into a Demon King by the Name of Femto.  Also the Hawks find out about Griffiths Dark Truth before he is morphed into the demon lord.  And the hawks find out that there the sacrifice.This is also the Darkest chapter in the Berserk series.  It's probably the most violent of out of them all.  Not to mention we finally see how Guts ended losing his arm and eye.  Not a pretty site eather.WARNING THOUGH!  IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A HAPPY LOVEY DUVIE ENDING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD because this probably has one of the worst endings I've ever seen in the series.  Over all I still think Berserk is a great series.  God's hand is a must own for Die Hard Berserk fans.Acctually it's not really and ending.  It's more a of a &quot;to be continued&quot; kinda thing.  I thought This Dvd was over all good but not the best, especially how it leaves lots of things out.Now that I have finished this Magneficent series awhile ago I've started to read the Manga which far more superb then the anime.  Check it out.Well That's all I have to say...and remember...This is not really an ending if you think about...And also when the credits are over you see one final last moment with Guts as he's walking away and as you can see this is after all the hell that he went through in ep 25 but the frustrating thing is &quot;how the hell did he get out alive&quot;?...Well You're just going to have to find out for your self by reading the manga.Later....",3,The End of a Dark Journey,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,2078,"['Berserk', 'bin', 'favortie', 'anime', 'ever', 'laid', 'eyes', 'it.But', 'comming', 'last', 'episodes', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'episodes', '.I', 'was', 'wrong', 'Not', 'Only', 'are', 'left', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'so', 'darn', 'sad.All', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'Juedoe', 'Pipin', 'Corkus', 'yeah', 'hawks', 'are', 'killed', 'one', 'one', 'Grotesque', 'what', 'messed', 'up', 'demons', 'Just', 'lookin', 'em', 'look', 'messed', 'up.Sadly', 'also', 'see', 'why', 'Guts', 'sword', 'more', 'then', 'dead', 'just', 'rest', 'Hawks', 'set', 'Episodes', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'Important', 'all.We', 'also', 'see', 'once', 'loved', 'Griffith', 'turned', 'Demon', 'King', 'Name', 'Femto', 'Also', 'Hawks', 'find', 'out', 'Griffiths', 'Dark', 'Truth', 'morphed', 'demon', 'lord', 'hawks', 'find', 'out', 'sacrifice.This', 'also', 'Darkest', 'chapter', 'Berserk', 'series', 'probably', 'most', 'violent', 'Not', 'mention', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'Guts', 'ended', 'losing', 'arm', 'eye', 'Not', 'pretty', 'site', 'eather.WARNING', 'THOUGH', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'EXPECTING', 'A', 'HAPPY', 'LOVEY', 'DUVIE', 'ENDING', 'DO', 'NOT', 'PURCHASE', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'still', 'think', 'Berserk', 'great', 'series', 'God', 'hand', 'must', 'own', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Berserk', 'fans.Acctually', 'not', 'really', 'ending', 'more', 'quot', 'be', 'continued', 'quot', 'kinda', 'thing', 'thought', 'Dvd', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'best', 'especially', 'how', 'lots', 'things', 'out.Now', 'have', 'finished', 'Magneficent', 'series', ""'ve"", 'started', 'read', 'Manga', 'far', 'more', 'superb', 'then', 'anime', 'Check', 'out.Well', 'have', 'say', 'remember', 'not', 'really', 'ending', 'think', 'also', 'when', 'credits', 'are', 'see', 'one', 'final', 'last', 'moment', 'Guts', 'walking', 'away', 'can', 'see', 'hell', 'went', 'ep', '25', 'frustrating', 'thing', 'quot', 'how', 'hell', 'did', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'quot', 'Well', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'self', 'reading', 'manga.Later']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25
741750,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00008G7ES,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","Even though I can understand why some people were put off by the open-ended conclusion of this series, I think the creators did an excellent job in bringing the story full circle. I am aware that the manga is more extensive and has more characters, but the story told in the anime has logic in itself and can be enjoyed nonetheless. In this set of episodes we finally find the answers to several questions that we have posed ourselves through the previous installments: What is the Egg of the King and what is its role? How does the first episode in the series tie up with the rest of the story? What is the involvement of the demons we find in some of the episodes and what is their relationship with the rest of the characters?Guts, Caska and several other members of the Band of Hawks set out to rescue Griffith, who has been held in the castle as a prisoner and tortured extensively for several years. Guts is feeling extremely guilty thinking that Griffith was captured and broken because he could not go on after Guts deserted him. The events that unfold from this point on generate confusion and unrest in the members of the Hawks, with Guts and Caska finding solace on each other and deepening their relationship. Still, Caska is torn between following Guts or staying and trying to help Griffith.From this point forward, the events unfold at great speed, with the demons finally entering the story full force, and the Band of the Hawks facing their destiny. Now I think the next step for me is to wait for the complete manga to be released in the US so I can follow the continuation of this story. I am fully satisfied with this series and it would be great if a second season were produced at some point. One final word of advice, when the last episode finishes and the titles come up, keep watching! There is an extra scene after the titles that is worth seeing.",5,&quot;Why don't I ever realize what I have until it's lost?&quot;,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,1873,"['Even', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'open-ended', 'conclusion', 'series', 'think', 'creators', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'am', 'aware', 'manga', 'more', 'extensive', 'more', 'characters', 'story', 'told', 'anime', 'logic', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'nonetheless', 'set', 'episodes', 'finally', 'find', 'answers', 'several', 'questions', 'have', 'posed', 'ourselves', 'previous', 'installments', 'What', 'Egg', 'King', 'what', 'role', 'How', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'What', 'involvement', 'demons', 'find', 'episodes', 'what', 'relationship', 'rest', 'characters', 'Guts', 'Caska', 'several', 'other', 'members', 'Band', 'Hawks', 'set', 'out', 'rescue', 'Griffith', 'who', 'been', 'held', 'castle', 'prisoner', 'tortured', 'extensively', 'several', 'years', 'Guts', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'guilty', 'thinking', 'Griffith', 'was', 'captured', 'broken', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'Guts', 'deserted', 'events', 'unfold', 'point', 'generate', 'confusion', 'unrest', 'members', 'Hawks', 'Guts', 'Caska', 'finding', 'solace', 'other', 'deepening', 'relationship', 'Still', 'Caska', 'torn', 'following', 'Guts', 'staying', 'trying', 'help', 'Griffith.From', 'point', 'forward', 'events', 'unfold', 'great', 'speed', 'demons', 'finally', 'entering', 'story', 'full', 'force', 'Band', 'Hawks', 'facing', 'destiny', 'Now', 'think', 'next', 'step', 'wait', 'complete', 'manga', 'be', 'released', 'US', 'can', 'follow', 'continuation', 'story', 'am', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'second', 'season', 'were', 'produced', 'point', 'One', 'final', 'word', 'advice', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'finishes', 'titles', 'come', 'up', 'keep', 'watching', 'extra', 'scene', 'titles', 'worth', 'seeing']",Berserk: God's Hands - Episodes 22-25

Throughout the series we witnessed Guts first encounter the band of the Hawk, and then from there help them lead them while under the leadership of Griffin to many victorys.  In the time he also earned a reputation as the 100 man slayer and also gain to some degree some inner peace.  Until now.  This set of episodes is by far the most violent and disturbing chapter in the series.It starts off with Guts, Caska, and other members of the band of the Hawk attempting to rescue Griffin who a year earlier raped the Princess after his crushing defeate to guts.  Griffin in that year was tortured worse than any man.  Guts and the group finally find him but not in the state that they remember.  As they try to escape the King sends his army to stop them.  From there Guts goes Berserk (no pun intended) as he easliy cuts through the armies like they are nothing.  However after they escape Griffin begins to realize his destiny and runs away from the band of the Hawk.  THey of course follow unaware of the horror that would soon ensue.  The pendant that Griffin had carried with him finally takes shape during the solar eclipse and his destiny is finally set as the leader of the armies of Hell.  In order for Griffin to become the leader however one last sacrafice needed to be made, the Band of the Hawk must die.At this point the series goes into it;s most horrific state as many of the characters we grew to love throughout the series die very violently and the episodes ends with band dead, Guts pinned by a demon with more wounds than he has ever ensued and Caska being raped by Griffin.Where the series leads from here I am not sure.  I got into the series through the DVD and in all honesty I have not read the Mangas.  However this DVD and it's episodes fall directly into the WTF catagory and also most disturbing episodes of the series.
