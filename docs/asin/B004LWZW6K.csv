1416015,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B004LWZW6K,Andre Dursin,"[6, 8]","For exploitation fans, horror nuts and 3-D enthusiasts, you couldn't find a more fitting film to unofficially end the summer season with than PIRANHA 3DD, the gleefully bad, junky sequel to Alexandre Aja's 2010 hit which - despite its token theatrical release last May - seems to have been shot with the small-screen in mind to begin with.This time out, the prehistoric piranhas have moved along to another group of underground lakes in Arizona, just in time for the relaunch of a water theme park run by college grad Danielle Panabaker and her resident, obnoxious stepfather David Koechner. Having tapped into the water supply where the piranhas are swimming about, ""The Big Wet Water Park"" is about to be the site of yet another bloody massacre once the piranhas arrive - about the same time as David Hasselhoff, playing himself as he hits ""rock bottom"" as the attraction's big guest star.Aja's original ""Piranha"" was an over the top, almost cheerful exercise in horror mayhem, and it's surprising - given the film's success - that the Weinsteins decided to go the cheap route with producing a follow up. Veterans of Dimension's home video sequels including director John Gulager and producer Joel Soisson were brought in to make ""Piranha 3DD"" on a clearly reduced budget, with notably diminished make-up effects (gorehounds will surely be disappointed by the reduction of severed heads and limbs here) and a B-list, younger cast (Christopher Lloyd does show up, briefly reprising his role from the original; so does Ving Rhames, who wisely opted to go uncredited under the circumstances).Make no mistake, ""Piranha 3DD"" isn't anything close to resembling a good movie, but once you realize this is essentially a trashy direct-to-video sequel - and acknowledge the diminished set of expectations that comes with the territory - the film still provides a modest amount of entertainment. This is especially true when it comes to Hasselhoff's involvement, which yields several big laughs (no more so than when the aging star, in lifeguard gear, runs to aid an obnoxious young boy to the strains of the ""Baywatch"" theme). The 3-D isn't anything spectacular - and the thrills never come close to matching the epic carnage of its predecessor - but the movie still provides a fast assortment of corpses, T&A; and the occasional cameo from a genre character actor (in addition to Lloyd, Rhames, and ""The Hoff,"" Gary Busey is offed in a weak opening sequence). It also wraps things up at around the 70-minute mark and adds some 10 minutes of amusing bloopers that roll over the end credits. It's not good, but it's certainly fun if you can get into the right mindset.Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray combo pack (3D, 2D and DVD) of ""Piranha 3DD"" includes a generally good 1080p MVC encoded 3-D transfer. There's ghosting in the image during the Busey sequence, but from that point forward, the natively-shot 3-D looks fine - the issue is that the 3-D isn't particularly well utilized by Gulager, so few effects stand out. The DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack is sound, and extras (on the 2D Blu-Ray) include commentary by Gulager, a couple of deleted scenes, a few featurettes with Hasselhoff, Koechner and Busey, and a worthless four-minute Michael Ratner ""comedy"" short, ""A Lesson with John McEnroe.""",3,Fun If You Can Get Into the Spirit..But With Mediocre 3-D,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,3270,"['exploitation', 'fans', 'horror', 'nuts', '3-D', 'enthusiasts', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'more', 'fitting', 'film', 'unofficially', 'end', 'summer', 'season', 'PIRANHA', '3DD', 'gleefully', 'bad', 'junky', 'sequel', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', '2010', 'hit', 'token', 'theatrical', 'release', 'last', 'May', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'small-screen', 'mind', 'begin', 'with.This', 'time', 'out', 'prehistoric', 'piranhas', 'have', 'moved', 'along', 'group', 'underground', 'lakes', 'Arizona', 'just', 'time', 'relaunch', 'water', 'theme', 'park', 'run', 'college', 'grad', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'resident', 'obnoxious', 'stepfather', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Having', 'tapped', 'water', 'supply', 'where', 'piranhas', 'are', 'swimming', 'Big', 'Wet', 'Water', 'Park', 'be', 'site', 'yet', 'bloody', 'massacre', 'piranhas', 'arrive', 'same', 'time', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'playing', 'rock', 'bottom', 'attraction', 'big', 'guest', 'star.Aja', 'original', 'Piranha', 'was', 'top', 'almost', 'cheerful', 'exercise', 'horror', 'mayhem', 'surprising', 'given', 'film', 'success', 'Weinsteins', 'decided', 'go', 'cheap', 'route', 'producing', 'follow', 'up', 'Veterans', 'Dimension', 'home', 'video', 'sequels', 'including', 'director', 'John', 'Gulager', 'producer', 'Joel', 'Soisson', 'were', 'brought', 'make', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'clearly', 'reduced', 'budget', 'notably', 'diminished', 'make-up', 'effects', 'gorehounds', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'reduction', 'severed', 'heads', 'limbs', 'here', 'B-list', 'younger', 'cast', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'show', 'up', 'briefly', 'reprising', 'role', 'original', 'so', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'who', 'wisely', 'opted', 'go', 'uncredited', 'circumstances', '.Make', 'mistake', 'Piranha', '3DD', ""n't"", 'anything', 'close', 'resembling', 'good', 'movie', 'once', 'realize', 'essentially', 'trashy', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'acknowledge', 'diminished', 'set', 'expectations', 'territory', 'film', 'still', 'modest', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'Hasselhoff', 'involvement', 'several', 'big', 'laughs', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'aging', 'star', 'lifeguard', 'gear', 'aid', 'obnoxious', 'young', 'boy', 'strains', 'Baywatch', 'theme', '3-D', ""n't"", 'anything', 'spectacular', 'thrills', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'epic', 'carnage', 'predecessor', 'movie', 'still', 'fast', 'assortment', 'corpses', 'T', 'A', 'occasional', 'cameo', 'genre', 'character', 'actor', 'addition', 'Lloyd', 'Rhames', 'Hoff', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'offed', 'weak', 'opening', 'sequence', 'also', 'things', 'up', '70-minute', 'mark', '10', 'minutes', 'amusing', 'bloopers', 'roll', 'end', 'not', 'good', 'certainly', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'mindset.Anchor', 'Bay', 'Blu-Ray', 'combo', 'pack', '3D', '2D', 'DVD', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'generally', 'good', '1080p', 'MVC', 'encoded', '3-D', 'transfer', 'ghosting', 'image', 'Busey', 'sequence', 'point', 'forward', 'natively-shot', '3-D', 'looks', 'fine', 'issue', '3-D', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'well', 'utilized', 'Gulager', 'few', 'effects', 'stand', 'out', 'DTS', 'MA', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'sound', 'extras', '2D', 'Blu-Ray', 'include', 'commentary', 'Gulager', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'featurettes', 'Hasselhoff', 'Koechner', 'Busey', 'worthless', 'four-minute', 'Michael', 'Ratner', 'comedy', 'short', 'Lesson', 'John', 'McEnroe']",N/A

Piranha 3D was a monster movie that was like a masterpiece compared to a Syfy original movie. However, Piranha 3DD really isn't any better than a lot of those Syfy original movies. I swear, it isn't much better than Mega Piranha and Dinocroc. There doesn't seem to be near as much gore as in Piranha 3D, which was that movie's selling point. This ones selling points seems to be boobs, but you can see those anywhere. I really wanted a lot of gore and action, and it just didn't happen much.

Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way.

1416027,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZW6K,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","Speaking as a fan of writer/director/producer Alexandre Aja, it isn't surprising to be one of the few who stand up for the ""Piranha"" remake. It was more or less as campy as everyone expected and the storyline was ridiculous, but the cast was pretty decent. The special effects were the crown jewel though. While the 3D effects were weak and the computer generated stuff wasn't so great, the practical effects were top notch. The gore was so good and it made a cheesy remake just a little bit better than it should have been.""Feast"" director John Gulager replaces Aja for ""Piranha DD,"" (the movie drops the 3 from its title on the regular Blu-ray and DVD) the production budget is about a fifth of what it was for the remake, and the cast is mostly filled with unfamiliar faces and washed up stars. Judging by the title and tag line alone, everything is doubled for the sequel. But as you can probably imagine everything goes even more downhill in comparison to the remake, as well. The campiness is magnified 100% and the sequel takes no shame in showcasing nothing but large, fake breasts. All obvious statements that shouldn't be considered bad if utilized properly, but ""Piranha DD"" doesn't exactly blend them together to make a worthwhile concoction.The 3D effects are atrocious; just bulky and blobby CG that looks like it was sloppily thrown together in minutes. The special effects in general take a huge nose dive from ""Piranha."" The water park sequence tries to recreate the beach mayhem from the remake relocated at a water park and it just fails horribly. The ratio of practical effects to computer generated ones in ""Piranha DD"" is probably somewhere around 25/75 and it just feels cheap because of it.When the piranhas aren't CG, the fish props look way too big. They're watermelon sized on land, but are small enough to swim up someone's genitalia in the water? In the meantime, the fish are pulling off completely impossible feats like breaking through grates, sheets of metal, and the concrete walls of pools. The result is something that is neither terrifying nor entertaining and is more along the lines of a movie seen on SyFy except without the boundaries of being restricted to cable.If the horrible fish weren't enough, the people are even worse. It's sad when the most enjoyable character in a movie is David Hasselhoff portraying a more exaggerated version of himself. Garey Busey shows up long enough to get farted on by a dead cow. Paul Scheer, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd return from the remake. Lloyd is the only one who makes himself useful. Meanwhile, Rhames does his best Cherry Darling impression and Scheer just kind of complains about everything.David Koechner is probably the most enjoyable of the new faces and that's mostly due to him playing his role way more seriously than he should. This is probably the least ridiculous and over the top that he's ever been. As for the younger parts of the cast, they're nothing but bait with lines. When they're not jumping in puke for no reason at all, humping pool jets, or being completely incapable of properly running off of a dock, they're having some of the worst sex to ever be featured in a horror movie. What transpires between Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is so utterly asinine; especially Shelby's last line. The sex scene in the van isn't much better.""Piranha DD"" is listed as having an 83-minute runtime, but it's more like 70 and is still difficult to swallow given its short length. You could at least find a few things to compliment in the remake. With ""Piranha DD,"" it essentially has nothing to make viewing this feature worthwhile. The cast is awful, the screenplay is unbearable, and the special effects are laughable. Even the ending makes it seem like everyone who made this hates its core audience. ""Here's this crap ending. Yeah, the movie bombed and everyone hated it but we're going to make another one anyway!""You know what you're getting with ""Piranha DD."" It does not offer anything that you wouldn't discover at face value or by watching the trailer. You know it's going to be nothing but naked women and gore. But when the gore doesn't deliver and nudity is all you have to fall back on, then you might as well just watch porn since you know you'll at least walk away from that with a spring in your step. ""Piranha DD"" will have you wanting to throw in ""Jaws"" just to wash off its stench and get the last remaining bloodthirsty and carnivorous fish out of your brain.Special features include Commentary with Director John Gulager, Producer Joel Soisson, and Co-Writer Marcus Dunstan, three Deleted Scenes, The Story Behind the DD (just shy of 8 minutes in length), The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff (around 2 minutes), Busey's Bloopers (also 2 minutes), Wet and Wild with David Koechner (about a minute and a half), and ""A Lesson with John McEnroe"" - A Dimension Short Film (about 4 minutes).""Piranha DD"" is now available as a single disc DVD and three disc combo (Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD +digital copy). It's rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use. The movie is presented in widescreen with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio with 5.1 DTSHD-MA (Blu-ray) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD) sound.

1416028,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004LWZW6K,DanD,"[2, 3]","Writing a straight-up serious review of PIRANHA 3DD is a bit beside the point.  Plot means little; something about a guy opening an adult-themed waterpark, his step-daughter opposed to the changes he's made, and suddenly the prehistoric fish from PIRANHA 3D show up and make a mess of things.  That's it, there you go, a few romantic angles thrown in--some predictably touching, some there for nothing other than nudity and graphic violence.  Oh, and humor--bucket loads of dark humor, just like with any horror comedy.PIRANHA 3DD isn't quite as funny/enjoyable as its predecessor, if only because we've been here before and know what to expect (what a great ending, by the way; not quite surprising, but still gutsy enough to feel new).  The acting is what it should be--over-the-top from the supporting cast, more authentic and realistic from the main pair (Danielle Panabaker and Matt Bush).  We've got David Koechner doing his thing; Christopher Lloyd back from the first one; Gary Busey making a nice intro cameo; and especially David Hasselhoff, doing probably the best role of his career--himself (he also comes away with some of the film's funnier lines).  The effects are predictably modern-cheesy (I didn't see the 3D version; still not convinced it's the wave of the cinematic future), and the script and direction are similar to the first.That's basically the gist: if you liked PIRANHA 3D, you'll like PIRANHA 3DD.  It's for those of us who don't always take our movies seriously.  It's a break from the Oscar-worthy dramas and the horror films that take themselves far too seriously.

Some of the scenes are shot and edited like a frenzied music video; some scenes are dead slow with few edits looking like castoffs they didn't know how to fit in.  Either they didn't know what they wanted to achieve in the first place, or the filmmakers were so inept that this was the best they could come up with.  It's scattershot to say the least; with humor ranging from lame to massive displays of appallingly bad taste (the decapitation of a child for laughs).  Most of it just felt sleazy and desperate, the work of puerile minds.  Things only got worse once David Hasselhoff showed up and just wouldn't go away (I thought he'd never leave).  As a Jaws spoof, this was a subpar retread offering nothing new.  As a sequel to Piranha 3D, it failed on every level.

The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success ""Piranha"" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.A school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.Roger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine ""Jaws"" if it took place in a water park the kids in ""Porky's"" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching ""Piranha 3DD.""The CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.""Piranha 3DD's"" high definition audio and video transfer will satisfy viewers. All the carnage and mayhem is visually clean and crisp. The 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees you'll hear every scream of terror, hiss of a piranha, and crash of the dramatic music score perfectly.There's lots of bonus material in the 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of the movie. Audio Commentary with director John Gulager, producer Joel Soisson, and co-writer Marcus Dunstan is included.The featurettes are short but cover more ground than you'd imagine. The seven - minute ""The Story Behind the DD"" covers the making of the movie with cast and crew interviews. ""The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff"" is exactly what it sounds like: the actor discussing the movie and his life. There are also short featurettes with fan-favorite actors Gary Busey and David Koechner entitled ""Busey's Bloopers"" and ""Wet and Wild with David Koechner.""Three deleted scenes give us more R-rated antics with Big Dave. The comedy short film ""A Lesson with John McEnroe"" is unrelated to the movie but still funny.The 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition of ""Piranha 3DD"" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware.

1416043,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B004LWZW6K,I'm Right,"[21, 33]","Piranha 3DD is a spectacular failure on almost all accounts. The director who's credentials include all the Feast movies can't maintain one good scene to save his life, every scene is an underwhelming void of entertainment. I don't even know where to start with this turd, but seriously, how do you f*** up Piranha's in a water park? That's like the easiest formula for cheap entertainment.-The Story: The story is great in theory, the piranha's for some unimportant reason can break through steel so they can get into water pipes, so they'll inevitably invade the water park on opening day (Jaws anyone?). The delivery however, is bafflingly terrible. You only see the water park in the first and last ten minutes of the movie, and the middle chunk of the film is devoted to three teens in a love-triangle going on a scooby doo adventure. Remember in the previous Piranha where Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames investigate the corpse on the docks and discover it's Piranha attacks? Yeah, that piece of the story is stretched out to the majority of the movie in this snooze-fest.Characters:-The main characters are lame, weak, tired, boring, predictable stereotypes. We have the virtuous 'last girl' who's going to school, is abhorred by sex, and is between two guys, the cop-douchebag and the misunderstood nice guy, no further explanation necessary.-David Koechner plays the amusement park's 51% owner (why a girl in college owns the other 49%, nevertheless cares so much about it is beyond me) who plays the smutty step-dad who wants to sexualize The Big Wet, unfortunately that's all he does and he doesn't get really campy or over the top until the very end.-David Hasselhoff plays himself at the park in a hilarious way, a burned out celebrity that doesn't really care about what he's doing, Hasselhoff made me laugh a few times which is why I didn't think Piranha 3DD was a complete waste of time, hence a 2 star.-Christopher Lloyd returns as well as the mad scientist further explaining whatever new thing the piranha's are capable of, he's campy and over-the-top as always and was a nice change of character from the dumb kids.-Ving Rhames and Jerry O'Connel's assistant (who still sports the sun-lotion on his nose) also come back in minor roles where they go to the water park on the worst possible day to rehabilitate themselves and get comfortable with being in water again. Ving Rhames was also pretty damn funny, and when he walks into the pool with shotguns for legs it's pure B movie madness, if only the rest of the movie could've been as good as those cameos.The 'Intentional' Stupidity of it all:-First of all, the douchebag cop is the only cop in this whole movie, and he looks like he just went into his junior year of highschool. So when the community discovers the presence of Piranha in their midst one year after the massacre that was the previous Piranha, the only person on the case is the young presumably inexperienced cop, he doesn't alert anyone else, doesn't tell anybody not to swim in the Piranha-infested water, none of that.-Better yet the heroine who KNOWS the water is Piranha-infested decides to jump in anways to ""check the grates"".-Then the water park that's trying to re-establish itself with sex appeal has an employee that's about 300lbs who has a face like a pug dog and has hobbies such as jumping in puke and using the water jets to masturbate. Not only is that a bad business move but the guy can't control himself, in the middle of their opening day he's still masturbating with the water jets oblivious to the piranha attacks going on. Who hired this guy again?Inept Directing:-There's a scene where a woman who unknowingly had a baby piranha in her vagina is getting intimate with her boyfriend when the piranha comes out and bites his penis. Now this is something that the director and the audience could've had a lot of fun with, they could've played it as really horrifying and/or really funny, but the scene just sort of happens. The woman passes out with puke spurting out of her mouth for some reason and the guy screams and walks over to the kitchen and severs his penis off with the piranha attached. Then right after that chaos everything is quiet and the girl wakes up somehow, walks around until the boyfriend jump-scares her. That's it? It's like they just read the script and filmed it just like that, no visual flair, no funny or ridiculous lines acted, it's all really just bland and trying too hard to be shocking, with no sense of passion from the filmmaker's part.-Another scene earlier has a couple getting kinky in a van using handcuffs when the van rolls into the lake after a mishap with the parking break, the girl can get out but the boyfriend is stuck in the van with the handcuffs still attached, then when he gets attacked you just see a few close-ups of flesh being bitten and see him reacting poorly. You don't really see any of the attack, all you see is another jump-scare where his bloody stump pops open to surprise the girl who's on top of the van. Also when the car is rolling into the water about 1 minute later it's in the middle of the lake, but cars don't float all the way in the middle of a lake before they start sinking, so this was another instance of plot conveniences trumping logic.The Piranha Attack: The disappointment to end all disappointments, Phantom Menace ain't got s*** on this. The shots that establish the park seem like a bunch of advertisements with naked chicks, going tubing down water slides, swimming in the pools, going tubing, etc. When the piranha eventually attack it's those exact same shots again with CGI Piranha added. There's virtually no build-up to the attack, you see one piranha that acts like a scout swim around for a second than swim back into the broken grates to tell the swarm or something. Somehow a solution that equals 'get out of the pool' is stretched out to like 15 minutes of underwhelming mayhem, showing mostly just the heroes randomly running around with some blood and bodies in the pools behind them in the background. The piranha's themselves just weren't threatening either, multiple times characters jump into piranha-infested waters and 'just narrowly' avoid getting eaten by the 5 or 6 piranha, it never feels like a massive swarm of them like in the first one, speaking of the first piranha...What worked for the first Piranha movie's attack was how the scene's worked together. The piranha's swam up to the partiers, bite the first lady, and chaos ensued in many different fun/gross ways. We go from the floating stage being toppled over, to people climbing frantically on boats, to boats running people over in the chaos, to half eaten people crawling out of the water. Here, it's just people splashing in red water that can't get out of the pool, and none of the creative gore such as a woman's hair getting ripped off is evident here, it's just prosthetic bodies. Weak.However there were a few moments where I was cracking up, David Koeschner trying to escape and running over a little kid was pretty great, and Ving Rhames comparing Piranha to kids whizzing in the pool also got a chuckle out of me. Another thing that was pretty funny was the zooming camera shot when Roy Schieder saw the boy get eaten by the shark in Jaws was used repeatedly whenever David Hasselhoff looked around, and the same dramatic shot comes back everytime Hasselhoff turns around again and looks at the carnage; words can't really do that part justice.Those few good chuckles was about all the entertainment value I got from Piranha 3DD though, it's a bad sign when the cameos are the only good thing going for your movie. Piranha 3DD's actual use of the piranhas was lame and underwhelming and overall I wouldn't recommend Piranha 3DD unless you're really curious/bored.",2,DDisapointment,1338768000,"06 4,

And he's opened an adult's only area of the park where people can drink, be nude and just get wet and wild.

Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[7, 12]","*******The review contains spoilers so if you are intending to see this flick, you may want to read this review afterwards********After 2010's hit horror remake ""Piranha"" made a killing at the box office ($83 million worldwide on a $25 million budget), Weinstein Company quickly gave the go ahead to make an even campier sequel with the affectionate title ""Piranha 3DD."" Tentatively scheduled for August 2011, the release date came and went without any word about the film. Weinstein soon announced that they would be releasing the horror sequel in November 2011. Once again, the release date whizzed by with no word from the studio as to when or if the film would be released. Now, on June 1st, the film has finally been released to horror hell. Opening in 83 theaters this weekend, the film is also showing on demand (where I caught it as no theaters within a 100 mile radius of me is playing the flick). With little press and even littler buzz, the film has little to no hope of making waves at the box office. Did Weinstein Company lose faith in the film? Is the film so awful that it simply doesn't deserve a theatrical release and the studios is simply fulfilling contract obligations? Let's take a step into these piranha filled waters and find out.""Piranha 3DD"" begins one year after the famous attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas. Extremely bad press from the incident has left the lake devoid of any life whatsoever. The town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism by horny spring breakers. At a nearby lake, two middle aged rednecks named Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager) wade into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow carcass, and before you can say ""piranha meal"" the farmers are killed by a hungry and very angry swarm of baby piranha.Enter Maddy (the lovely ""Friday the 13th"" remake star Danielle Panabaker) a marine biology student. She returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror, and our amusement, that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with `water-certified strippers', and re-open it as ""Big Wet"" where the ""double DD's get in for free."" At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old friends, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (the enjoyable slimy Chris Zylka), and Barry (Matt Bush) who has secretly had a crush on her since grade-school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy), and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). It doesn't take long to guess who will and won't become piranha bait.Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her you-know-what(yes, you read that right). Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) go to have sex in their van. They accidentally trip the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake, where they are both devoured by the angry piranhas.The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by the swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry bring it to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd even stranger and more over-the-top than he was in the original) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark.Back at the waterpark, we find celebrity lifeguard David Hasselhoff (played by himself in a hilarious, mocking tone similar to Jennifer Tilly's role in ""Seed of Chucky"") has been hired on as an ""A list"" lifeguard from the waterpark. It doesn't take long before the piranhas find their way to the park to devour and feast on the lovely young teens and the families enjoying their stay at ""Big Wet.""Sound silly, over-the-top, and preposterous? Of course it is! The film is ""Piranha 3DD"" not ""Schindler's List."" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like ""Piranha 3DD"" is a different proposition. The film itself is not nearly as good as the original remake (how's that for an oxymoron?) but I would argue that this sequel is a hell of a lot more fun. Take out the 13 minute credits (stay for them, there are some funny bloopers and behind the scenes video) and you are left with a 70 minute nonstop rollercoaster ride that is over before you can even begin to think of the bad acting and nonsensical plot developments. ""Piranha 3DD"" left me craving another sequel and isn't that the best thing you can say about a cheesy horror flick?",5,"""Piranha 3DD"" Serves Up Gory Fun B-Movie Style",1338508800,"06 1,

1416061,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B004LWZW6K,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[47, 53]","The recent remake ofPiranhawas nearly pitch-perfect. Gleefully hapless characters (portrayed with excellent B-movie abandon by the likes of Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and even Richard Dreyfus) trotted through the cliche-riddled story and provided both laughs and inventive, over-the-top gore. It wasn't out to win any awards, but what it WAS out to do -- amuse and disturb -- it did quite well. So, of course, they had to make a sequel.Unfortunately, they neglected to include half of the original formula. Truly excessive T&A;? Check. Obvious character archetypes doing/saying obvious things? Check. Humor, either hokey, offensive, or smart? Check. Scares and grind-em-up deaths?Not so much.The problem here lies right in the set-up: an unapologetically awful man (played by David Koechner) opens a water park (with an adults only section) and contrives to fill it for free from a nearby lake. Three guesses how that plays out.Yes. The piranhas infest the water park, and therein lies the problem. I don't know if you've ever been to a water park, but every one I've ever visited appeared to have been planned and designed by a blind man with permanent vertigo. This is usually in keeping with the looping, curving, twisting paths of the various water slides and lazy rivers, and it means it's not that hard to get turned around if the park is big. The point being: filming in one must be hell.There is never any real sense of place to the film, and the park is never given a wide enough shot to really show the scale of the disaster. At the same time, the very fact that people are inches away from simply hopping out of the water reduces both the scale, spectacle, and believability of any of the chaos. There's a ten or fifteen minute scene of people thrashing about in water that is two feet wide and three feet deep. Gone is even any attempt at terror or (failing that) anything close to the stomach-churning destruction found in the first film.The movie tries to make up for this in other ways. There are a couple of piranha attacks outside of the park, one of which is so over-the-top ludicrous that it is almost annoying. I won't give away any details, but I will say that it's one step away from characters shooting live piranhas out of shotguns like some kind of Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. But that's probably the point. While the first film was an aggressive and ham-fisted satire of Swarm Horror, this movie seeks only to be a cartoon of it. It's not really the same thing, and so this film -- if you'll pardon the pun -- very much lacks the bite that made the first one such a success.As a live action cartoon, though, it's not bad. David Hasselhoff does a great job of making fun of himself AND the film. (""Stupid ginger boy,"" he complains when he hears the screams of a kid who's getting eaten. ""Why did you get back in the water?"") He's one of the better parts of the film, although he is also overused. Ving Rhames, Paul Scheer, and Christopher Lloyd, on the other hand, are woefully underused. They brighten up their brief blips in the film, but all of them feel like they were added to the script at the last minute. There are some puns and gags that work, and some that don't.It feels half done, is the point, and this is even evident in the run time. IMDB will tell you it's 83 minutes long, but that's counting the very slow credits crawl at the end. Perhaps knowing the deficit in their film, the makers put outtakes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel over half of these end credits. It's kind of like a nice, advanced special features addition, and I enjoyed it for what it was, but I also saw it for what it was meant to be: a quick, easy distraction from the fact that the film was more entertaining behind the scenes than in front of it.Fun for what it is, but not as fun as it wants to be or should live up to. You might enjoy yourself if you have low expectations, or you might just have more fun watching Skinemax and putting some fish in a blender.",3,Piranhas Invade a Water Park ...

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 1]","In the interest of fairness and full disclosure, I must admit that PIRANHA in any ""D"" is not my kind of movie.  Usually, I try to avoid watching films of this genre because I hate losing those 90-120 minutes of my life that I can never get back again.Also, since I do not own a 3-D Blu-Ray player or television set, I opted to watch this movie on regular DVD.That said, I have no doubt that this sequel to PIRANHA 3D (2010) will more than please the audience for which it was intended (i.e. people who enjoy watching movies in which monster fish eat other people.)  In fact, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames, both of whom were in the first picture, are back for this one.The JAWS-like plot is set in moneymaking Big Wet Water Park where the prehistoric flesh-eating fish find a smorgasbord on the attraction's opening day of summer.The problem with this picture, directed by John Gulager, is that the filmmakers can't seem to decide whether they wanted to make an all out horror film or an all out spoof.  As it turned out, the movie is neither.  In the first half, the gore factor is just too much to evoke laughs, and some of the humorous sequences attempted (e.g. a sex scene with disastrous results) are too ridiculous to be funny.Truthfully, while watching the movie, I was tempted several times to turn the damn thing off...but I'm glad that I didn't, because about midway through, David Hasselhoff makes his first appearance (playing himself and making light of his public image), and then PIRANHA 3DD becomes fun...even for me.  It becomes the all out spoof that it should have been from the start.Hasselhoff is terrific, as are Lloyd and Rhames, who are obviously enjoying their roles.  Also in the cast are Gary Busey, Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner and the director's father, Clu Gulager.The 3-disc (3D, Blu-Ray, DVD) combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including a ""Making of"" featurettes, deleted scenes and bloopers.

The movie is a sequel to the fun Piranha 3D from 2010 which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It wasn't Oscar worthy but it was acted well, had some scary moments, plenty of over-the-toplessness and was pretty funny.  Not to be confused with filet mignon, it was still a darn good cheeseburger.3DD opens with grad student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker, ""The Crazies"") arguing with her now widowed step-father (David Koechner, who seemingly tries to play his role dramatically) about the future of their inherited water park.  Mandy, a 49% owner wants it to continue to be family friendly.  Chet (Koechner) has the great idea to make it an adult strip club located within the water park.  Chet wins the battle.The film is set in the progressive state of Arizona so we are easily convinced that it was no problem getting approval for families with young kids to come in the same gates as horny voyeurs.  Not to worry however as there is a fence that apparently separates the family friendly environment from full frontal nudity and pole dancing.  The 48"" rule applies.  That's how tall you must be to see over the fence and the pre-adolescent boys take advantage.  Those boys also have an advantage over the audience however as director John Gulager only lingers a couple nano-seconds when it comes to bare skin before moving on to the next shot.  Hey, the movie's only 82 minutes.  Gotta hurry.But, this is a movie about deadly fish right?  This particular water park would seem to be isolated from the now abandon lake nearby where all the piranha did their dirty work.  Thanks to good old Chet who had sunk a deep water well near the park (where's that regulation Arizona?), the still viable fish eggs have their chance to hatch...and of course they do (thanks to Gary Busey).  The well gives the quick growing meat eaters direct entry to the fresh water pools.Piranha 3DD also teaches us a lesson about anatomy.  I didn't know that a small fish could enter a woman's naughty parts (in this case, nubile virgin Katrina Bowden), then grow a bit with nothing more than the woman having a stomach ache.  But wait.  Shelby the virgin (Bowden) decides that it must be time for her to abandon her ""V"" status with her boyfriend.  He of course is game but gets a climax he wasn't expecting!

David Hasselhoff provides some hilarious moments as himself, which in itself becomes a joke that just goes on for way too long, all of which is captured by director John Gulager (Feast) who comes off with some solid moments that are sadly overshadowed by too many cheap scare tactics and some truly awful CGI and green screen effects.

In my mind, this somewhat limits the believability of the attacks. Maybe its just because I grew up in a tourist town and I'm a little too familiar with water parks. But putting that aside for the sake of entertainment, there is certainly a scare factor involved. The effects were pretty good even if not always believable. Aside from David, I found the rest of the cast to be overacting a bit, but again, I expect this is a horror movie, and almost look forward to it.

They put a lot of effort into this movie and it does somewhat show on screenPlot: Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) has just returned to her hometown for college spring break to find out that her idiotic stepfather (David Koechner) has turned her childhood memories into a sexual nightmare, her very own 49% of their waterpark has turned into 51% of the stepfathers own, sensual fantasies. But if that wasn't enough a school of vicious prehistoric Piranha has returned to a new lake located next to the waterpark and her stepfather (being the moron he is) has put a well near the waterpark to get free water which leaves an easy access for the Piranha to enter and cause another massacre!Review: Some directors like to push the envelope to create something farfetched and still obtain that gross out fun factor, John Gulager is one of those directors who tries so hard to push that seal open and sometimes he succeeds straight up (Feast), but other times he only makes it halfway (Piranha 3DD) and sometimes he nearly demolishes it (Feast 2 and 3). Piranha 3DD is a no-brainer when it comes to entertainment it want's fans and critiques to numb their minds and make fun out of everything on the screen, some fans/critiques unfortunately cannot and I respect that it shows that they want a seriously superb movie.

Alexandre Aja created the Perfect and my favorite B-Movie (which was the first 3d remake of Piranha) and he did it with everything in place. There were some scenes in Piranha 3d that genuinely freaked/grossed me out and in Piranha 3DD there is some differences, the top three kills felt truly forced, one of them was impossible and the other acted like something out of a final destination movie. The whole movie felt a bit forced but I can live with it, the question is.... How much can you take un-seriously before giving up?Acting: Danielle Panabaker, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer, David Koechner, Katrina Brown, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager and even David Hasslehoff were all excellent in their roles.... Especially David Hasslehoff whose character was portrayed perfectly (Hint, he played himself).Gore: The top three kills that I mentioned earlier involved two decapitations (one impossible and the other funny yet disturbing), and a spear (trident) impalement in the face... the rest we get is a piranha chewing a guy's ass, lots of blood, grisly corpses, a severed hand, and more! It was gory enough, still, I am glad they didn't go extremely farfetched with the gore!Bottom Line: Double the trouble but double the silliness makes this flick decent in my book. It is on a par with Sharktopus in my opinion and I'm sticking to it. I do hope they make a sequel, there are so many more settings such as a bar, a casino, a school.... The possibilities are endless!Rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use(Exact Same MPPA Rating as the first movie ha ha)Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 5For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3",3,"Double D, Dies Dreadfully",1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3824,"['are', 'pretty', 'cruddy', 'kills', 'movie', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'decent', 'budget', 'film', 'was', '5', 'Million', 'Dollars', 'think', 'looked', 'better', 'what', 'paid', 'fact', 'used', 'shots', 'first', 'movie', 'scenes', 'just', 'tinted', 'color', 'make', 'look', 'different', 'note', 'do', 'used', 'more', 'practical', 'fish', 'effects', 'CGI', 'ones', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'show', 'screenPlot', 'Maddy', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'just', 'returned', 'hometown', 'college', 'spring', 'break', 'find', 'out', 'idiotic', 'stepfather', 'David', 'Koechner', 'turned', 'childhood', 'memories', 'sexual', 'nightmare', 'very', 'own', '49', '%', 'waterpark', 'turned', '51', '%', 'stepfathers', 'own', 'sensual', 'fantasies', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'school', 'vicious', 'prehistoric', 'Piranha', 'returned', 'new', 'lake', 'located', 'next', 'waterpark', 'stepfather', 'being', 'moron', 'put', 'well', 'waterpark', 'get', 'free', 'water', 'easy', 'access', 'Piranha', 'enter', 'cause', 'massacre', 'Review', 'directors', 'push', 'envelope', 'create', 'something', 'farfetched', 'still', 'obtain', 'gross', 'fun', 'factor', 'John', 'Gulager', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'so', 'hard', 'push', 'seal', 'open', 'sometimes', 'straight', 'up', 'Feast', 'other', 'times', 'only', 'halfway', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'sometimes', 'nearly', 'Feast', '2', '3', '3DD', 'no-brainer', 'when', 'entertainment', 'want', 'fans', 'critiques', 'numb', 'minds', 'make', 'fun', 'everything', 'screen', 'fans/critiques', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'respect', 'want', 'seriously', 'superb', 'movie', 'like', 'films', 'genres', 'categories', 'Everything', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'Prometheus', 'little', 'flick', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'Piranha', 'Hungry', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'yes', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'such', 'feeling', 'movie', 'seriousness', 'level', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'absent', 'movie', 'humor', 'tone', 'movie', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'created', 'Perfect', 'favorite', 'B-Movie', 'was', 'first', '3d', 'remake', 'Piranha', 'did', 'everything', 'place', 'were', 'scenes', 'Piranha', '3d', 'genuinely', 'freaked/grossed', 'out', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'differences', 'top', 'three', 'kills', 'felt', 'truly', 'forced', 'one', 'was', 'impossible', 'other', 'acted', 'something', 'final', 'destination', 'movie', 'whole', 'movie', 'felt', 'bit', 'forced', 'can', 'live', 'question', 'How', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'un-seriously', 'giving', 'up', 'Acting', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Paul', 'Scheer', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Katrina', 'Brown', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Clu', 'Gulager', 'even', 'David', 'Hasslehoff', 'were', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Especially', 'David', 'Hasslehoff', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'Hint', 'played', '.Gore', 'top', 'three', 'kills', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'involved', 'two', 'decapitations', 'one', 'impossible', 'other', 'funny', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'spear', 'trident', 'impalement', 'face', 'rest', 'get', 'piranha', 'chewing', 'guy', 'ass', 'lots', 'blood', 'grisly', 'severed', 'hand', 'more', 'was', 'gory', 'enough', 'still', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'extremely', 'farfetched', 'gore', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Double', 'trouble', 'double', 'silliness', 'flick', 'decent', 'book', 'par', 'Sharktopus', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'do', 'hope', 'make', 'sequel', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'settings', 'such', 'bar', 'casino', 'school', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'Rated', 'R', 'sequences', 'strong', 'bloody', 'horror', 'violence', 'gore', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'Exact', 'Same', 'MPPA', 'Rating', 'first', 'movie', 'ha', 'ha', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '5For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '3']",N/A

Questions?I gave the film three stars, one each for David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd, and Gary Busey, who all did their part to bring this fishy thriller to life. Sadly, the opening scene involves Gary Busey and a farting cow, and does not go well allowing Busey to leave the set early. Would you believe Christopher Lloyd as a mad scientist? His role is more substantial than Busey's, but the big ticket star of the show is David Hasselhoff, who gets a choice part that even features a prophetic line of dialogue, ""Welcome to rock bottom."" Mostly the film stars big-chested women you've never heard of and will likely never hear from again in a plot involving a water park in which the lifeguards have been replaced by strippers.The plot proceeds about like you'd expect (hyper-smart fish that can pierce solid steel on the warpath against nubile youngsters) and great scenes like the piranha interruptus scene (concluding in a terrible dilemma with a butcher knife,) or my personal favorite moment involving a love van, handcuffs, prayer, and piranhas all adding to a cohesive whole. Diverse plot elements such as a sheriff with a combination prosthetic leg/shotgun and the ultimate (deserved) clotheslining scene in movie history makes this almost as good as an average SyFy aquatic animal feature. For those of you interested in good local governance, there's even a subplot about the high cost of the municipal water supply!There are a lot of bonus features, including deleted scenes, ""The Story Behind Piranha DD,"" ""The Hofftastic World of David Hasselhoff,"" and by far the best reason to own the DVD, a short film titled ""A Lesson With John McEnroe,"" which made the remainder of the DVD worthwhile.I recommend this piranha movie primarily due to the presence of its tennis lesson.",3,"""Double D Swims Free!""",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,1908,"['Piranha', 'DD', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'title', 'deadly', 'fish', 'attitudes', 'invade', 'adult', 'water', 'park', 'Questions', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'who', 'did', 'part', 'bring', 'fishy', 'thriller', 'life', 'Sadly', 'opening', 'scene', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'farting', 'cow', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'allowing', 'Busey', 'leave', 'set', 'early', 'Would', 'believe', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'mad', 'scientist', 'role', 'more', 'substantial', 'Busey', 'big', 'ticket', 'star', 'show', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'who', 'choice', 'part', 'even', 'prophetic', 'line', 'dialogue', 'Welcome', 'rock', 'bottom', 'Mostly', 'film', 'big-chested', 'women', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'hear', 'again', 'plot', 'involving', 'water', 'park', 'lifeguards', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'strippers.The', 'plot', 'proceeds', ""'d"", 'expect', 'hyper-smart', 'fish', 'can', 'pierce', 'solid', 'steel', 'warpath', 'nubile', 'youngsters', 'great', 'scenes', 'piranha', 'interruptus', 'scene', 'concluding', 'terrible', 'dilemma', 'butcher', 'knife', 'personal', 'favorite', 'moment', 'involving', 'love', 'van', 'handcuffs', 'prayer', 'piranhas', 'adding', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'Diverse', 'plot', 'elements', 'such', 'sheriff', 'combination', 'prosthetic', 'leg/shotgun', 'ultimate', 'deserved', 'clotheslining', 'scene', 'movie', 'history', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'average', 'SyFy', 'aquatic', 'animal', 'feature', 'interested', 'good', 'local', 'governance', 'even', 'subplot', 'high', 'cost', 'municipal', 'water', 'supply', 'are', 'lot', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Story', 'Behind', 'Piranha', 'DD', 'Hofftastic', 'World', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'far', 'best', 'reason', 'own', 'DVD', 'short', 'film', 'titled', 'Lesson', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'made', 'remainder', 'DVD', 'worthwhile.I', 'recommend', 'piranha', 'movie', 'primarily', 'due', 'presence', 'tennis', 'lesson']",N/A

The original story has Richard Dreyfus getting killed in the first scene. In this production we are happy to see it is Gary Busey. In the original feature, porn stars provided most of the topless scenes. In this one they opt to use main stream women. Perhaps the first feature should be called 3DD and this one 3D.This story takes place in Arizona where Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is dismayed that her stepfather (David Koechner) has changed the water park into an adult water park with topless ""certified"" strippers acting as lifeguards. Meanwhile the late Gary Busey has released the hideous piranha into the town's lake. So how do we get piranha from the lake into the swimming pools? Christopher Lloyd gives us clues.The movie is a teen sex romp. It has lines which are an adolescent's dream, such as ""Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming"" and a few I can't repeat. The van scene was interesting if not sacrilegious. There is an intense lake scene with our heroine and one of the weirdest sex scenes since ""Teeth."" Up to this point I was thinking how much I liked what they did, with some new bits.
