Beck,"[10, 11]","The workout can be broken down in these segments: 1) Warm Up 2)Jab 3) Hook Combo 4) Arms 5) Shuffle Combo/Tondu 6) Leg raise Combo 7) Floor Work 8) Cool down.The best of feminine pilates and masculine boxing combined for a great workout without hurting my knees.  How can one sweat if one is not jumping or doing lunges?  Vivian does more repetition and combos in fluttering movements.  Not only will your muscles feel the burn, but your heartrate will go up.  Don't be fool by the small movements.  You will sweat as much as the instructor.  It's all in the gloves.  Swinging your arms in those 1 lbs gloves is enough to give you a sweat! By the time you get to the floor exercise, you will be exhausted. Great workout and the instuctor is smart enough to trademark this effective workout :)",5,Great cardio without too much pounding on the joints,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,792,"['workout', 'can', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'segments', '1', 'Warm', 'Up', '2', 'Jab', '3', 'Hook', 'Combo', '4', 'Arms', '5', 'Shuffle', 'Combo/Tondu', '6', 'Leg', 'raise', 'Combo', '7', 'Floor', 'Work', '8', 'Cool', 'down.The', 'best', 'feminine', 'pilates', 'masculine', 'boxing', 'combined', 'great', 'workout', 'hurting', 'knees', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'sweat', 'one', 'not', 'jumping', 'doing', 'lunges', 'Vivian', 'more', 'repetition', 'combos', 'fluttering', 'movements', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'muscles', 'feel', 'burn', 'heartrate', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fool', 'small', 'movements', 'will', 'sweat', 'as', 'much', 'instructor', 'gloves', 'Swinging', 'arms', '1', 'lbs', 'gloves', 'enough', 'give', 'sweat', 'time', 'get', 'floor', 'exercise', 'will', 'be', 'exhausted', 'Great', 'workout', 'instuctor', 'smart', 'enough', 'trademark', 'effective', 'workout']",N/A

This is not for the faint of heart and will pose quite a challenge for those who are not used to exercise! Absolutely, by all means get this if you are new to exercise though as you can go at your own pace, stop when you need to and build up slowly. This was so much fun!! I sweated so much, found myself smiling through the agony! She is a lot of fun!! I highly recommend this workout for anyone who wants to lose weight, get in shape, or just get those feel good endorphins going!!

1385825,AVOWQEFO0P3B4,B0045OR460,Kaley Quinn,"[0, 1]","&#8220;Piloxing&#8221; seeks to combine cardio kickboxing, ballet moves and Pilates into a fast-paced workout that tones the whole body. I was skeptical at first about how this would work, but Swedish trainer Viveca Jensen somehow makes it all work, and even makes it fun. Her motto is &#8220;Sleek, Sexy, Powerful,&#8221; and you definitely feel this throughout the workout. Her bubbly energy and enthusiasm makes you want to work harder -- but she always cautions you to work at your own level and &#8220;do what you can.&#8221;The hour-long workout was a sweat-inducing combination of boxing and moves that were sort of like standing Pilates moves. Some were also very similar to ballet movements, such as pli&eacute;s and tendus. I definitely felt it in my legs, and in my arms too -- in the video they wear &#8220;Piloxing&#8221; gloves that weigh 1 pound each, I think, but I didn&#8217;t have them so I used light wrist weights. I also loved that this is a workout you can do in your bare feet -- Viveca and some of her back-up crew don&#8217;t wear any shoes. However, for some of the jumping moves, such as the jump-and-switch boxing stance, shoes might be a good idea after all.The &#8220;Express&#8221; workout was a series of moves targeting arms, butt/thighs, and abs. These were more Pilates-oriented and were all excellent toners, especially the butt and abs sections.I would recommend this video to anyone who loves fun fast-paced cardio, wants to do some toning without heavy weights, and likes Pilates in addition to some &#8220;dancey&#8221; steps. Is it pure boxing or Pilates? No. But it uses some of the moves from each in a light-hearted workout that will get your heart pumping and your muscles working.",5,Fast-paced & Fun!,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1727,"['8220', 'Piloxing', '8221', 'combine', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'ballet', 'moves', 'Pilates', 'fast-paced', 'workout', 'whole', 'body', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'how', 'would', 'work', 'Swedish', 'trainer', 'Viveca', 'Jensen', 'somehow', 'work', 'even', 'fun', 'motto', '8220', 'Sleek', 'Sexy', 'Powerful', '8221', 'definitely', 'feel', 'workout', 'bubbly', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'want', 'work', 'harder', 'always', 'cautions', 'work', 'own', 'level', '8220', 'do', 'what', 'can.', '8221', 'hour-long', 'workout', 'was', 'sweat-inducing', 'combination', 'boxing', 'moves', 'were', 'sort', 'standing', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'similar', 'ballet', 'movements', 'such', 'pli', 'eacute', 'tendus', 'definitely', 'felt', 'legs', 'arms', 'too', 'video', 'wear', '8220', 'Piloxing', '8221', 'gloves', 'weigh', '1', 'pound', 'think', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'so', 'used', 'light', 'wrist', 'weights', 'also', 'loved', 'workout', 'can', 'do', 'bare', 'feet', 'Viveca', 'back-up', 'crew', 'don', '8217', 'wear', 'shoes', 'However', 'jumping', 'moves', 'such', 'jump-and-switch', 'boxing', 'stance', 'shoes', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'all.The', '8220', 'Express', '8221', 'workout', 'was', 'series', 'moves', 'targeting', 'arms', 'butt/thighs', 'abs', 'were', 'more', 'Pilates-oriented', 'were', 'excellent', 'toners', 'especially', 'butt', 'abs', 'sections.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'fun', 'fast-paced', 'cardio', 'do', 'toning', 'heavy', 'weights', 'Pilates', 'addition', '8220', '8221', 'steps', 'pure', 'boxing', 'Pilates', 'No', 'moves', 'light-hearted', 'workout', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'muscles', 'working']",N/A

Say it with her Swedish accent and it sounds less ridiculous for some reason.This is a fair cardio workout for and advanced beginner to intermediate. If you can do The Firm or Tae Bo you will breeze through this. I have low back problems and this is reasonably low impact for the cardio and does not get it aggravated (Traci Anderson's BS cardio, on the other hand, nearly landed me in the hospital).I get just a little sweaty and I am never sore the next day, which is nice and means I can do this one more frequently than the more advanced stuff I also like.I do wish the floor work and ab sections were better. The floor work is hard to follow without watching exactly what she is doing, which is hard to do when you are on all 4s. The ab section is just a little too light for my tastes. I personally don't like the pilates style scoop ab exercises she starts with. I may just have my form off, but they do nothing for me.I do like this DVD for my light workout days. I like the instructor. She is not irritating and is pretty easy to follow.

I don't have the gloves she is wearing, but I make do with wrist weights that are one-pound each. There are a lot of fusion workouts on the market, but this one stands out for its uniqueness.
