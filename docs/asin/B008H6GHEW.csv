This series constantly delivers laughs and fun plot lines even though ABC has jerked this series around since it aired. Pop culture references that actually work. Characters that are different from typical sitcom archetypes. Character behavior that is just far fetched enough to keep things light and hilarious. This series has endless replay value as well.
