942775,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BITUWU,A Customer,"[3, 4]","You have to admire Craig Brewer's first feature film Hustle & Flow. It has a gritty, urban down home sensibility and an uncompromising hard edge that is impossible not to like, and it achieves the almost impossible feat of imbuing sympathy for it's titular hero, a sleazy, misogynistic, and at first glance, decidedly unsympathetic Memphis pimp.Terrance Howard gives a standout performance as DJay. It's DJay's dream to become a rap star, but the dream always seems just a little too far off. Cunning, manipulative, and earnest, DJay spends his days pimping, seeking out a meager existence, peddling his girls from his beat-up Chevy Caprice, and occasionally dealing weed on the side.Life is pretty grim for this amoral hero - he lives in a ratty, un-air-conditioned house with three prostitutes, and although he never physically abuses them, his frustration at his lot in life steadily boils to the surface, affecting his relationships with them. There's the heavily pregnant and insecure Shug (Taraji P. Henson), a quarrelsome and loud-mouthed stripper Lexus (Paula Jai Parker), who seems to be always giving him attitude; and Nola (Taryn Manning), a skinny young white woman to whom DJay confides his hopes and fears as they wait in the front seat of the Chevy for clientsHaunted by memories of his father's early death by heart attack, DJay stares out at the humid, oppressive Memphis night and wonders whether he too can become a famous rap artist, just like the guys he watches on TV.  Hope comes in the form of old friend Key (Anthony Anderson), whose respectable job and marriage to his sweetheart Yevette (Elise Neal), masks a deep dissatisfaction, and Shelby (DJ Qualls), a church musician who, when he's not helping make music for the local choir, passionately believes that inspiration and peace can come from smoking a joint.The centerpiece of the film is the efforts by this mismatched group to cut a record holed up in a makeshift backroom studio, with egg cartons on the walls for soundproofing. Their interactions give the movie a rough, boyish humor that undercuts some of the obvious melodrama, and the music they come up with does indeed sound pretty good, as they learn to develop the ""hustle and flow"" of rap.Hustle and Flow is pretty much a generic ""follow your dreams"" movie. But what separates this movie from the rest of the pack is it's hard-boiled gritty Southern atmosphere, the conviction of it's characters, and the fact that it doesn't white-wash the less salubrious aspects Djay's personality - our hero sheds a tear when he hears a hymn in church, but he is also capable of terrible cruelty and selfishness when he tosses a little boy out into the cold.This is a showpiece of acting for Mr. Howard, his lanky frame, downtrodden face, and sad melancholy eyes ensure that he's plays totally to type. It's a performance that is full of nuance and magnetism, and he manages to capture beautifully DJay's stresses and worries.  Does Djay really have any talent? Perhaps, perhaps not, but one thing for sure, he is perfectly capable of instilling the life of the streets into his songs, even if they are full of profanity that has to be edited out for radio airplay.I guess you could say that Hustle and Flow is a sort of ""feel good"" movie laced with elements of deep-seated cynicism. It attacks ghetto life head on, and exposes a kind of deep-seated misogyny in the process, yet it doesn't offer any real solutions to the frustrations endemic to this sort of life, apart from offering up the tag line, ""follow your dreams.""However, the film is still largely a powerful piece of work, and serves as a telling commentary on how dreams are unfulfilled  - or even fulfilled depending on your interpretation of the ending - in today's celebrity and fame-obsessed America.

942776,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B000BITUWU,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[4, 4]","This movie really gets me. HUSTLE & FLOW, featuring a blazing turn from the enthralling Terrence Howard, is an unexpectedly wrenching movie that moves along at a beat just as pulsating as the music genre it centers around. The movie wraps you around it's finger with it's opening ""calm before the storm"" monologue where D-Jay (Howard) sits in his hot Chevy with Nola (Taryn Manning), his best prostitute, talking about the world. You can see this is a man doped up on some drugs while she is as well, but the artistic soul inside of him is clearly trying to push itself out of D-Jay in a way he can't yet grasp. And as soon as the audience sees the core reality and humanity of the character... the beat starts driving the film.When D-Jay starts to rap, Howard shows you that this isn't a passion slowly coming out of him... it is a tidal wave of frustration, passion, talent, and desperation pounding against a wall of drugs, depression, and disappointment that he has built up for years. Yet, even in his childlike excitement over the new prospects in his life, he can never break free of the lifestyle and situations that life as a pimp has put him in.This truly is a brilliant performance from Howard and he deserves the attention he has received from the Academy and other critics organizations. But it's also refreshing to know that this ensemble was recognized at SAG. It truly was some of the best ensemble work I've seen in a long time (far surpassing CRASH... which was an example of true ensemble work sure, but this is an example of true ensemble work on a superior level with the talent leaping off the screen). Taryn Manning was especially compelling in her role as D-Jay's ""cheif investor"". It's a shame no buzz developed around her for a Supporting Actress nomination.I've read some reviews cite this film as ridiculous... but to me, the life of a Pimp is in some ways ""ridiculous"". Despite the terrible living situations and rough lifestyle... their lives are filled with over-indulgence in all the wrong things. Sex, drugs, and music. However, this movie never looks down on the struggle and dream of D-Jay... partially because of brilliant pacing, and very much so because of Terrence Howard's searing performance.

942777,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B000BITUWU,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 1]",When it comes to inspirational movies this one has to rank up there for me. Hustle and Flow could be the everyday story of people living in poverty. It does not mean you have to be a pimp but you could be coming through a bad situation and trying to make it better. This movie to me proves why Terrance Howard should get more roles in movies acting. At least in a main role. He shows true emotion and it makes you feel like you're in his shoes and your rooting for him to do better in life. All the acting in this movie is good and I believe it really gives the hip hop community a positive aspect instead of always being looked down upon. The one thing I wish the movie would have changed is it could have been longer. I feel the movie was moving great and then after Terrance Howard got arrested the movie almost ended not right there but you had the feeling the movie should have kept on going. Besides the time of the movie this is a great movie and I always watch it when I am looking for something to inspire me.

942778,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000BITUWU,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 4]","There is much that is good about Hustle & Flow.  First and foremost, it solidly establishes Terrence Howard as a matinee idol.  Not only does he have movie star good looks and an inherently soulful persona certain to build empathy, he's demonstrated an uncanny ability to submerge himself in a role and create characters from the inside out.  Compare performances in Crash, Lackawanna Blues, and Hustle & Flow for an idea of his range.  Better still, his excellent performance is surrounded by some terrific supporting players.  Taryn Manning is winning as Nola, Djay's ""franchise"" performer, and Anthony Anderson is credible as Key, his friend and producer.  Special mention must be made of Taraji P. Henson; her Shug is well realized, believable, and sympathetic. The pickin's get a little slimmer after that, although it's always nice to see Isaac Hayes being Isaac Hayes, which is no small accomplishment.But good acting alone will not save a bad film, and the problems with Hustle & Flow stem from the story and primary character.  Djay is a pimp who aspires to rap stardom, in this respect the film is an inverted American dream saga of downward mobility since the only life form lower than a pimp, (excluding lawyers), is rap ""musician.""  Some see intelligence in Djay; I was more struck by his incompetence.  Indeed, when we meet him, he appears to be ""the pimp that couldn't slap straight.""  When one of his employees practically begs him to hit her all he can do is look inadequate.  His lyrics, (especially the unintentionally ironic - ""It's hard out there for a pimp"" - as if anyone would feel sympathy for this most parasitic of all beings), are unconvincing in addition to being ugly and vulgar.  This is perhaps the real problem with Hustle & Flow; the only route out of street life appears to be by glorifying it.Rap outsiders will find the studio scenes instructional as they learn that the ""music,"" such as it is, is churned out by digital boxes crammed full of stored samples.  Thus, the skill level required to produce this dreck is just above zero, the machine does the work.  Though promising through the second act, riding on Howard's great performance, Hustle & Flow collapses in act three and falls on its face amidst a heap of gangsta rap cliches.  The miraculous transformation of Nola, from street ho to power-suit music promoter, is a piece of deus ex machina Hollywood nonsense that should make writer/director Craig Brewer deeply ashamed.  But then, the ho with the golden heart is a tried-and-true bit of preposterous mythology that's worked for a long time, Pretty Woman made some money from it.  Hustle & Flow is the best movie about rap ever made, I only wish that wasn't damning it with faint praise.",3,Hard To Be A Pimple When You Want To Be A Dimple - Boyeeeeeee,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2736,"['much', 'good', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'First', 'foremost', 'solidly', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'matinee', 'idol', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'movie', 'star', 'good', 'looks', 'inherently', 'soulful', 'persona', 'certain', 'build', 'empathy', 'demonstrated', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'submerge', 'role', 'create', 'characters', 'inside', 'Compare', 'Crash', 'Lackawanna', 'Blues', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'idea', 'range', 'Better', 'still', 'excellent', 'performance', 'surrounded', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'players', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'winning', 'Nola', 'Djay', 'franchise', 'performer', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'credible', 'Key', 'friend', 'producer', 'Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Shug', 'well', 'realized', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'pickin', 'get', 'little', 'slimmer', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'being', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'small', 'accomplishment.But', 'good', 'acting', 'alone', 'will', 'not', 'save', 'bad', 'film', 'problems', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'stem', 'story', 'primary', 'character', 'Djay', 'pimp', 'who', 'rap', 'stardom', 'respect', 'film', 'inverted', 'American', 'dream', 'saga', 'downward', 'mobility', 'only', 'life', 'form', 'lower', 'pimp', 'excluding', 'lawyers', 'rap', 'musician', 'see', 'intelligence', 'Djay', 'was', 'more', 'struck', 'incompetence', 'Indeed', 'when', 'meet', 'be', 'pimp', 'could', ""n't"", 'slap', 'straight', 'When', 'one', 'employees', 'practically', 'hit', 'can', 'do', 'look', 'inadequate', 'lyrics', 'especially', 'unintentionally', 'ironic', 'hard', 'there', 'pimp', 'anyone', 'would', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'most', 'parasitic', 'beings', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'addition', 'being', 'ugly', 'vulgar', 'perhaps', 'real', 'problem', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'only', 'street', 'life', 'be', 'glorifying', 'it.Rap', 'outsiders', 'will', 'find', 'studio', 'instructional', 'learn', 'music', 'such', 'churned', 'out', 'digital', 'boxes', 'crammed', 'full', 'stored', 'samples', 'Thus', 'skill', 'level', 'required', 'produce', 'dreck', 'just', 'zero', 'machine', 'work', 'promising', 'second', 'act', 'riding', 'Howard', 'great', 'performance', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'act', 'three', 'face', 'heap', 'gangsta', 'rap', 'cliches', 'miraculous', 'transformation', 'Nola', 'street', 'ho', 'power-suit', 'music', 'promoter', 'piece', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'Hollywood', 'nonsense', 'should', 'make', 'writer/director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'deeply', 'ashamed', 'then', 'ho', 'golden', 'heart', 'tried-and-true', 'bit', 'preposterous', 'mythology', 'worked', 'long', 'time', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'made', 'money', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'best', 'movie', 'rap', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'damning', 'faint', 'praise']",Hustle & Flow

First of all, the character is about 35 years old, a bit old to start off as a rapper. Secondly, we see him doing things like (literally) throwing a prostitute AND HER BABY out of his house, forcing a teenage prostitute to have sex with an elderly music store owner to get a microphone he can't afford, and generally using and manipulating everyone around him.Then he tries to get over by making such lovely, creative masterpieces of art as ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp"" and ""Whip That Trick"" which both of his prostitutes gleefully dance to the beat of their own destruction.No thanks, y'all. 30 years ago, the ""blaxploitation"" trashterpiece films corrupted too many ignorant and guidance-deprived youths of that generation into thinking that it was cool to be a pimp or a drug dealer.

942781,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BITUWU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I kind of verbally destroyed this film when it first came out.  I thought it was stupid and generic and very `MTV' like and just all around over-hyped, over-praised and definitely over-nominated (Howard beating out Russell Crowe for that Oscar nomination stung like a knife to the gut).The thing was, I didn't hate it, I just didn't get it.Years later (got these years just fly by) and I have grown slightly fonder of this film, especially Howard (I still feel that Crowe would have made a better nominee, but I'm not that upset anymore about Howard getting the attention).  The film, in my opinion, is still kind of silly in parts and rather unbelievable (and this film is trying to be believable, so points deducted there), but it has heart and soul where it counts and so I have come around to appreciate this film a little more for what it `does' bring to the table.The film tells the story of a pimp named DJay.  Basically, when DJay hears about a local rapper coming back around town for the 4th, he gets it in his head that if he puts his heart and soul on a demo tape and gets it to the rapper then he could find himself reaching fame.Yeah, that's not going to happen.I applaud the film for not taking the easy Hollywood clich&eacute;s (ala happy endings) here, but in the process they almost played contradiction in some areas.  Their development of DJay, for example, feels uneven.  Even though he has flourishes of selfishness (like an exploitation of Nola) he is depicted as far too civil and likable to be taken seriously as a thug.  I mean, he just doesn't have the grit needed to sell this role.  Yes, I understand they didn't want to deliver a stereotype, and I'm all for that.  No one needs to see yet another pimp/tyrant, but they needed to integrate the personality flaws a little better.  Without really developing DJay's vicious side (sure, he's manipulative, but he's far too subtle and sympathetic to be honest) his more outlandish actions (that bathroom scene) come across as unbelievable.  It kind of reminds me of Denzel Washington's performance in `American Gangster'.But, in Howard's case I blame the script.  You can see the nuance in his performance, and you can see that he is working hard to elevate the material (and he does for the most part), but the script didn't come up to meet him half way.I also feel like the overall construction of the film felt rather generic.  There just isn't anything that special about this film when all is said and done, unless by special you mean Taraji P. Henson.Okay, let's talk about that kind of special.Henson doesn't have a lot of screen time, but when she is there, you know it.  As the pregnant and opinionated Shug, Henson dominates the screen with her persona, but what is even more impressive is the way she allows the bent up frustration and pain to surface in the most unexpected of ways.  As she sings to hook to DJay's song you can see this bellowing intensity (subtle yet overpowering) as she feels the pain and hurt strip away from her to uncover an unfamiliar feeling of accomplished glee.She is happy for the first time in forever.In fact, if I can praise any aspect of this film it would be the cast.

942782,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000BITUWU,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","""Hustle and Flow"" - ostensibly about a small-time pimp in Memphis, Tennessee - is actually a brilliant dissection of and meditation on the creative process.  Be prepared to be delighted by this film.  Everything about it is top-notch, from Craig Brewer's off-the-charts-good script and direction, to Terrence Howard's award-winning and award-deserving acting, to the great music.  An added treat is seeing actors like Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls - heretofore known for their appearances in broad comedies - shine in dramatic roles.  Anderson, in particular, is fantastic here.  As Brewer notes in the ""Making Of"" featurette, it's Anderson's role whose relative 'normalcy' is our tie to the film.  He's a believable and likable character.  We want to see him succeed.  It's also worth noting:  Chris Bridges (Ludicris) is a very good actor.  Some will say ""he's playing himself.""  I disagree.  The pivotal scene in the movie - the one where he and Howard's character meet - has good acting on both sides of the table.The core of the movie is that we get to see - in amazingly rich detail - the process that leads to the creation of a couple of songs.  When you see the movie, you'll understand why ""Hard Out There For a Pimp"" won an Academy Award for Best Song.  It's because it's not simply part of a soundtrack.  Rather, the tale of its creation is the very soul of the film.""Hustle"" is also one of those rare cases where the extras measure up to the movie itself.

Howard is one of those actors who wears his heart and soul on his sleeve, and from what I've seen of how he imbues a character with depth both here and in a quite different role in Crash, I anticipate great things from him in the future.  He strikes me as a deeply honest man and actor.So, even though a movie about a pimp trying to better himself through rap music might not have been high on my list of must-sees Terrence Howard made me care about the struggle of this particular pimp and his ""family"" and I even liked the music they produced, although hip-hop/rap would likewise not be high on my list of must-hears.Any performance and film that takes me out of my pre-conceived notions earns my respect and gratitude.

942784,A1184B1I5G87YF,B000BITUWU,"Austin ""atticus101""","[2, 2]","Hustle & Flow, is a 2005 movie that caught a lot of attention at Sundance by winning the Audience Award and a closet full of other awards that topped off with Oscar nominations for lead actor Terrance Howard and a win for Three 6 Mafia for Best Original Song ""It's hard out here for a pimp""(it works in the film, trust me).  The film is the story of Djay, played by Howard, a low rent pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, Tennessee who is suffering from his own existence.  He lives with three women, one who is pregnant, another who is a stripper, and the other a girl he pimps out in the back alleys of Memphis.  His side duplex is crowded with the baby boy belonging to the stripper and no air conditioning.  While delivering some weed to local bar owner Arnel (Issac Hayes), he learns that local rapper turned super star, Skinny Black (Chris `Ludacris' Bridges) is coming in for a 4th of July party and Arnel wants Djay to supply him with the ""good"" weed for this party.  Djay begins to see parallels between his life and Skinny's and where their paths diverged, placing Skinny in the lap of luxury and Djay in the hood.  A chance meeting with an old high school classemate (Anthony Anderson) who is a local music producer and a drug addict that trades a child's keyboard for drugs, gives Djay the idea for a hustle to put on Skinny and hopefully break out of his current existence.Hustle & Flow is about a world very few of us can imagine or want to live.  Terrance Howard's Djay is a lowly person who pimps women for $20 a trick and takes what he can off Lexus, the stripper (played masterfully by Paula Jai Parker).  Like Michael Cain's Carter, Howard's Djay doesn't let anything stop his hustle of Skinny.  He lies, uses Nola (Taryn Manning), his girl in the car, and violence to make his dream come true.  The level that this film works on is brilliant.  Every time you begin to root for Djay, he does a despicable act to make you hate him again and then they being to rebuild his reputation for you again, only to tear it down again.Probably one of the best parts of the film is the use of Skinny Black.  Much like Orson Well's Harry Lime in The Third Man, Skinny is a mythical character, taking on whatever persona is given to him by characters and scenes in the film.  When he finally does appear, you half expect him to be glowing with angelic aura and ooze coolness.  Like Well's Harry Lime, Ludacris' Skinny isn't the man you think he is and ends up getting a comeuppance that will make you squirm.Hustle is a rap song with back story.  It is a tough movie that makes no apologies for what it is or what it shows (though nothing is grotesque or gratuitous) to the audience.  Its sound track is amazing and Terrance Howard is a man on the move in Hollywood with his upcoming role in Marvel's Iron Man and his inspired performance in the Oscar surprise Crash.",5,A Rap song with back story,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2868,"['Hustle', 'Flow', '2005', 'movie', 'caught', 'lot', 'attention', 'Sundance', 'winning', 'Audience', 'Award', 'closet', 'full', 'other', 'awards', 'topped', 'off', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'lead', 'actor', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'win', 'Three', '6', 'Mafia', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'hard', 'here', 'pimp', 'film', 'trust', 'film', 'story', 'Djay', 'played', 'Howard', 'low', 'rent', 'pimp', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'who', 'suffering', 'own', 'existence', 'three', 'women', 'one', 'who', 'pregnant', 'who', 'stripper', 'other', 'girl', 'out', 'back', 'alleys', 'Memphis', 'side', 'duplex', 'crowded', 'baby', 'boy', 'belonging', 'stripper', 'air', 'conditioning', 'delivering', 'weed', 'local', 'bar', 'owner', 'Arnel', 'Issac', 'Hayes', 'local', 'rapper', 'turned', 'super', 'star', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'Chris', 'Ludacris', 'Bridges', 'coming', '4th', 'July', 'party', 'Arnel', 'Djay', 'supply', 'good', 'weed', 'party', 'Djay', 'see', 'parallels', 'life', 'Skinny', 'where', 'paths', 'diverged', 'placing', 'Skinny', 'lap', 'luxury', 'Djay', 'hood', 'chance', 'meeting', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'classemate', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'who', 'local', 'music', 'producer', 'drug', 'addict', 'child', 'keyboard', 'drugs', 'Djay', 'idea', 'hustle', 'put', 'Skinny', 'hopefully', 'break', 'current', 'existence.Hustle', 'Flow', 'world', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'imagine', 'want', 'live', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Djay', 'lowly', 'person', 'who', 'women', '20', 'trick', 'what', 'can', 'off', 'Lexus', 'stripper', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Paula', 'Jai', 'Parker', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'Carter', 'Howard', 'Djay', ""n't"", 'let', 'anything', 'stop', 'hustle', 'Skinny', 'Nola', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'girl', 'car', 'violence', 'make', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'level', 'film', 'brilliant', 'time', 'begin', 'root', 'Djay', 'despicable', 'act', 'make', 'hate', 'again', 'then', 'being', 'rebuild', 'reputation', 'again', 'only', 'tear', 'down', 'again.Probably', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'use', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'Much', 'Orson', 'Well', 'Harry', 'Lime', 'Third', 'Man', 'Skinny', 'mythical', 'character', 'taking', 'persona', 'given', 'characters', 'scenes', 'film', 'When', 'finally', 'appear', 'half', 'expect', 'be', 'glowing', 'angelic', 'aura', 'ooze', 'coolness', 'Well', 'Harry', 'Lime', 'Ludacris', 'Skinny', ""n't"", 'man', 'think', 'up', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'will', 'make', 'squirm.Hustle', 'rap', 'song', 'back', 'story', 'tough', 'movie', 'apologies', 'what', 'what', 'nothing', 'grotesque', 'gratuitous', 'audience', 'sound', 'track', 'amazing', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'man', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'upcoming', 'role', 'Marvel', 'Iron', 'Man', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'surprise', 'Crash']",Hustle & Flow

Terrence Howard certainly did his homework preparing for his role; his Memphis patois and small-timer pimp demeanor seemed dead-on.Where this film really excels is in its depiction of Southern poverty; the trashy neighborhoods, listless manner, and oppressive humidity (the characters almost always seem to be sweating) make the tableaus very convincing. So when HUSTLE & FLOW starts winding towards its not-very-realistic conclusion, the viewer can draws on the good will the film has built up to just let it slide... or flow.

942786,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000BITUWU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","Before I start in on this review, I think I need to make a few things clear: 1) I don't watch MTV, and 2) I don't like rap music. Hopefully that will help put things in perspective for those who choose to read this because this isn't a tale about a rapper nor about music; it's the story of never giving up on one's dreams, a universal theme that takes on an entirely new scope in writer/director Craig Brewer's excellent film HUSTLE AND FLOW.I didn't much care for BOYZ IN THE HOOD and I felt that 8-MILE was over-hyped, so I was hesitant to watch something with a similar sounding theme. But my worries were unfounded. Although what you've probably heard is true (""It's the story of a pimp and his whores""), chances are you're only getting a snapshot glimpse of this amazing character film by listening to such a basic definition.Terrence Howard plays D'Jay the pimp, a good pimp, struggling to make ends meet by employing three women in his ""crib"". But a chance encounter with a music mixer whom he used to go to school with lifts his spirits and makes him feel as if he's having a mid-life crisis. D'Jay's attempts to cut his own music consume him, even to the point of using one of his employees' skills to obtain a $250 microphone (sparking off a rather heated exchange, I might add).The fact that the story takes place in Memphis added a genuine sense of realism to the film, too (from the down-and-out neighborhoods and on-location shoots near bridges and underpasses).The actors - without exception - reached deep down into themselves and pulled up some of the finest performances of 2005. Every single actor in the movie LIVED those roles. All of the Oscar nominated films in 2005 (although this one wasn't nominated for Best Picture) held a valid message, and I absolutely loved how different yet similar they were. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CAPOTE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, CRASH and MUNICH all had amazing historical or cultural aspects littered throughout them, and HUSTLE AND FLOW is no exception; why it wasn't nominated in the Best Picture category ahead of MUNICH is a mystery to me, though.Never giving up on your dreams (""By any means necessary"") is both the message of the film and of the film-makers. Watching the extra features on the DVD, I learned that the producers shopped around Hollywood for financial backing but couldn't find any. Year after year and studio after studio, they got turned down. So, in the spirit of ""let's go and do it ourselves"", they put their own money forward (a measly $8 million sunk into it from pre- to post-production).If you haven't seen this movie just because of what you've heard, you're cheating yourself out of an excellent night of entertainment. Just remember, you don't have to be young to enjoy the themes talked about here. This is dreaming at its ugliest and its best. And I still don't like rap music, but I may be buying the music track to this film.",5,A Movie With A Theme Everyone Can Understand,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2915,"['start', 'review', 'think', 'need', 'make', 'few', 'things', 'clear', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'MTV', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rap', 'music', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'help', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'who', 'choose', 'read', ""n't"", 'tale', 'rapper', 'music', 'story', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'one', 'dreams', 'universal', 'theme', 'entirely', 'new', 'scope', 'writer/director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'excellent', 'film', 'HUSTLE', 'AND', 'FLOW.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'BOYZ', 'IN', 'THE', 'HOOD', 'felt', '8-MILE', 'was', 'over-hyped', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'something', 'similar', 'sounding', 'theme', 'worries', 'were', 'unfounded', 'what', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'true', 'story', 'pimp', 'whores', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'only', 'getting', 'snapshot', 'glimpse', 'amazing', 'character', 'film', 'listening', 'basic', 'definition.Terrence', 'Howard', ""D'Jay"", 'pimp', 'good', 'pimp', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'employing', 'three', 'women', 'crib', 'chance', 'encounter', 'music', 'mixer', 'whom', 'used', 'go', 'school', 'lifts', 'spirits', 'feel', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', ""D'Jay"", 'attempts', 'cut', 'own', 'music', 'consume', 'even', 'point', 'using', 'one', 'employees', 'skills', 'obtain', '250', 'microphone', 'sparking', 'off', 'rather', 'heated', 'exchange', 'might', 'add', '.The', 'fact', 'story', 'place', 'Memphis', 'added', 'genuine', 'sense', 'realism', 'film', 'too', 'down-and-out', 'neighborhoods', 'on-location', 'shoots', 'bridges', 'underpasses', '.The', 'actors', 'exception', 'reached', 'deep', 'down', 'pulled', 'up', 'finest', 'performances', '2005', 'single', 'actor', 'movie', 'LIVED', 'roles', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'films', '2005', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'held', 'valid', 'message', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'how', 'different', 'yet', 'similar', 'were', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'CAPOTE', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'CRASH', 'MUNICH', 'had', 'amazing', 'historical', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'littered', 'HUSTLE', 'AND', 'FLOW', 'exception', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'category', 'ahead', 'MUNICH', 'mystery', 'though.Never', 'giving', 'up', 'dreams', 'means', 'necessary', 'message', 'film', 'film-makers', 'Watching', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'learned', 'producers', 'shopped', 'Hollywood', 'financial', 'backing', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'Year', 'year', 'studio', 'studio', 'got', 'turned', 'down', 'So', 'spirit', 'let', 'go', 'do', 'put', 'own', 'money', 'forward', 'measly', '8', 'million', 'sunk', 'pre-', 'post-production', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'just', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'re"", 'cheating', 'excellent', 'night', 'entertainment', 'Just', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'young', 'enjoy', 'themes', 'talked', 'here', 'dreaming', 'ugliest', 'best', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rap', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'buying', 'music', 'track', 'film']",Hustle & Flow

I thought it was decent for what it is, but oscar worthy it is not, all except a few supporting roles who seem to outshine the star whenever they're on screen.  Howard is an overrated entity, an actor with some star power that seems to be overhyped to the point that when you finally see him on screen your dissapointed because he just doesn't LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.  I hope he doesn't get the fifth slot at the oscars because his performance just isn't oscar material.  The movie as a whole carries a good value for us to see, that you don't have to stay where you are or feel that your place is confined to the life you live now...you can better yourself and you can rise above the prison you face.  DJay (Howard) is a pimp, hustler and drug dealer.  He has Nola (Manning in a great supporting role), his star ho and figuratize lil' sis and theres Shug (now here is the oscar worthy performance of the film...Taraji P. Henson shines here) pregnant and emotional and the light in DJays dark tunnel.  After meeting Key (Anderson), an old high school buddy he decides to try his hand at putting together a record.  With the help of Key and Shelby (DJ Quals who provides some laughs) he puts together a demo to show Skinny Black (Ludacris), the Memphis legend, once turning hits in his mothers laundry room and now rolling in the big leagues.  The film shows the fire in the eyes of those who want to be more than they are, and those that are wiling to fight to get where they need to be.  For a pimp who's shot down almost every step of the way DJay shows he has the fight to make it, but will he?  The film is decent, a good film that shows who you can be if you work hard at it...with some impressive suppoting roles and an impressive script.

942801,AVCRD98TH48RN,B000BITUWU,D. Knouse,"[6, 6]","4.5 stars.  We've all seen this story before.  A gangster, or a pimp as it is in this story, sees a chance to crawl out of the nowhere life he is seemingly trapped in and achieve some sort of redemption and/or trancendency through music.  It's easy to root for the nobody reaching for the brass ring against all odds in the dim hope of becoming recognized as a greater human being than anybody thought possible.  But most of these type of films fall flat due to poor writing and second-rate acting.  ""Hustle & Flow"" is a surprising exception.  The acting, all around, is often astonishing.  Terrence Howard leads the way with a dominating performance which reminded me of the fine work of Benicio Del Toro, where both actors completely lose themselves in the role and we all believe the character actually exists somewhere out there in the world.  The dialogue is superb, and with so many good actors drawn to this film, the words reach extremely high levels of literary sharpness.  The biggest surprise for me, however, was that I thoroughly enjoyed all the music throughout the movie.  I despise most Rap, but in ""Hustle & Flow"" the rapping is smooth and enveloped with soul, thus achieving much more depth of emotion in the final summation.  Once again, an independent film shows up all those over-hyped, over-budget Hollywood films that we are force-fed each year.

942805,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BITUWU,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Surprisingly powerful performances dominate what is essentially a familiar story of a man who dreams of having a better existence than the one he has. What's revelatory is the atmosphere that director-screenwriter Craig Brewer paints in this bitingly realistic film focused on DJay, a Memphis pimp desperate to change his marginalized life and become a rapper to get out of the ghetto. He's obviously bright and articulate but morally bankrupt, as he makes a living selling the services of two women, the young but world-weary Nola and the embittered stripper Lexus, with a third prostitute at home, the self-defeating Shug, pregnant with his child. In the midst of a mid-life crisis, DJay reconnects with an old schoolmate, Key, who is now a sound engineer for a local church, who in turn, introduces DJay to Shelby, a white musician with his own beat machine. Together they cut a demo tape that DJay plans to give a local celebrity, hip-hop rapper Skinny Black, at a 4th of July party thrown by a mutual friend Arnel.The film takes a while to gain its momentum, as Brewer establishes the gritty realism of his setting before moving the plot along. Credit Amy Vincent's verit&eacute;-style cinematography, which makes us inhabit the ghetto setting without caution. Thanks mostly to Terrence Howard's searing portrayal of DJay, the story gains a palpable soul in his struggle to make it. Make no mistake in assuming the movie will be unrelentingly bleak and violent. It is, in certain ways, an idealistic film about finding one's destiny no matter how onerous the odds. Brewer is wise to keep his focus on the characters rather than the situation as the actors deliver the goods in unexpected ways. Comic actor Anthony Anderson is surprisingly subtle as Key, and along with Elise Neal's sharp turn as his high-strung, upwardly mobile wife Yevette, represents the black middle-class lifestyle with observational precision.The three women who play the prostitutes leave vivid impressions - Paula Jai Parker powerfully shows the angry desperation of the aging Lexus; Taryn Manning combines the hick and huckster of Nola, the only one making DJay money; and in the film's most poignant performance, Taraji P. Henson brings heart and painful melancholy to Shug. When she discovers her vocal chops during a recording session or innocently brings in a lava lamp, Henson is heartbreakingly impressive. Ludacris makes his key moments count as the nihilistic Skinny Black. There are also some predictable plot turns that move the story toward clich&eacute;, including a climax that teeters on melodrama and a somewhat far-fetched conclusion, but Brewer's original execution compensates.

942808,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BITUWU,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Terrence Howard is one of those actors who seemingly can do anything.  No matter what the role he intelligently chooses to play he is always phenomenally fine (Crash, Ray, Lackawanna Blues, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Four Brothers, Hart's War, etc etc etc).  In HUSTLE & FLOW writer/director Craig Brewer has finally given him a vehicle that allows him more screen time and the opportunity to create a character that burns his image on our memory indelibly.The story of a pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, stuck in the poverty level and rapidly drowning in mid-life crisis, who pulls himself into the stream of his need and dream to be something different, a rapper star, has been told before but never in the gritty realistic atmospheric way this film does.  One of the most telling sequences of both writing and acting is the opening scene of the film when Djay (Howard) quietly talks his philosophy to Nola (Taryn Manning), his primary prostitute, simply sitting in the front seat of his car, awaiting johns.  Howard makes this soliloquy pungent yet quiet and in the words we hear provide the outline for the story to follow.While Terrence Howard's is towering, the supporting cast is superb also.  Anthony Anderson, DJ Qualls, Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, Isaac Hayes, and Ludacris all offer genuine portraits of difficult characters.  The smarmy side of Memphis is well captured by cinematographer Amy Vincent.  This is  a fine film, a bit difficult to watch at times because of the bruises of poverty and the  depths to which people must descend at times to survive.  But the story is pungent and tough and Terrence Howard is a marvel to watch.

One cannot write about ""Hustle & Flow"" without centering praise on the lead performance from Terrence Howard. As DJay, the conflicted, oily pimp looking to break free from the game and satisfy his long held dreams, Howard delivers a career-best performance. On paper, the character arc for DJay doesn't veer far from the familiar, including instances of DJay seducing his stable of hookers and vicious displays of his red-hot temper.What Howard accomplishes with his acting is making DJay a human being - albeit an icy one, but there's a fire behind his glare that screams out more character motivation than anything in the speech-heavy screenplay could. Howard is ferocious, funny, and most significantly, capable of expressing DJay's inner thought process. He brings believability to the way the character does business, most importantly the ""flow"" of the title. Building off his grand work in ""Crash,"" Howard has finally come into his own, with ""Hustle"" capturing his Oscar-worthy concentration brilliantly.Anthony Anderson is also excellent as his friend/producer, and there is also Taryn Manning who is very strong in a role as a prostitute who wants to do more with her life.

I don't particularly like rap, but I like the movies that rap has inspired about the down-and-out guy trying to cut a record. Terrence Howard (Four Brothers, Big Momma's House) stars a Djay, a pimp trying to get by selling Nola (Tarryn Manning, taking a big step from ""Crossroads"") and Lex (Paula Jai Parker) while supporting the pregnant Shug (Taraji P. Henson). Taking inspiration from a rapper named Skinny Black (Ludacris) who lived in the same town and made it big, Djay with the help of old friendKey (Anthony Anderson) tries to cut a big record. You may remember a simalar story from movies such as ""8 Mile"" but writer/director Craig Brewer does it a bit different. The dialouge is inspired, the raps aren't that bad and Howard gives the character a vulnerability while keeping the necessary toughness. While, Howard's performance was acclaimed I wouldn't expect any Academy Award nominations being thrown at him even though he would deserve it. The end of the film was quite good, just when you think it's over for him sh*t happens.

Henson's performance, and she was great as Shug. Terrence Howard was phenomenal as  Djay. Anthony Anderson brings a lot of heart to his role, and DJ Squal added even more humor into the mix. I'm not sure about Tryn Manning. She fell short on complexity of character, though in the end, she does get to have her dopey say, though most of the credit would go to the film editors. I'll say her hair stylist and costumer did an excellent job..  A huge perk was Issac Hayes' appearance as Arnel.Unfortunately, the character themes would be: Pimps are just doing what life sets down before them; prostitutes are ridiculous, ultimately have hearts of gold, and are still, at the end of the day, glam; tricks are the same old slobs that they always were; and gangsta rappers are gun totin' roustabouts. Nothing new, fresh or realistic here.The script and direction of the film are ... interesting but didn't leave me with much viewer satisfaction. The action in Hustle and Flow was predictable, at best.Don't get me wrong. Hustle and Flow is worth watching in spite of its flaws.

942829,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BITUWU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","In ""Hustle & Flow,"" Terrence Howard plays a pimp and pusher named Djay.  The fact Howard has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor gives you some indication that Djay is not your ordinary pimp and pusher.  There is not going to be an argument that Djay is a noble figure, but there is a certainly nobility is his desire to come up with a better life and he does have a certain rhetorical flair and even eloquence when he is not spouting the rap lyrics he has written down in his little notebook.  Howard's performance, which is as memorable as anything you have seen in the past year, is certainly a major part of what makes the character compelling, but writer-director Craig Brewer (""The Poor and the Hungry"") gets credit as well.So, as our story begins Djay has come to the conclusion that there are better things to be in this world than a pimp.  Skinny Black (Ludacris), a big rap star, is coming back to his Memphis hood to visit where he got his start at a club run by Arnel (Isaac Hayes).  Djay thinks that all he has to do is put his demo tape in the hands of Skinny Black and that will be enough to make him a star.  But before that happens Djay has to make the demo tape.  So he gets his hands on a digital keyboard and works out some stuff to play for Key (Anthony Anderson), who usually records church music but knows Shelby (DJ Qualls), who knows enough about rap music to at least make that part sound good.  So Key staples cardboard egg containers to the walls of Djay's dining room to make a do-it-yourself soundproof recording studio, and try to see if Djay has any lyrics that could actually be played on the radio.  Fortunately Shug (Taraji P. Henson) the hooker comes up with the hook for the song, which becomes ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.""  Whatever else happens tomorrow night at the Academy Awards, the performance of this nominated song is going to present some interesting problems, to say the least.There is a key moment in ""Hustle & Flow"" when Djay discovers that the microphones are picking up the sound coming from a neighbor's house.  Djay has to go over and ask nicely for some consideration, which proves that he is willing to do whatever it takes to make his dream come true.  However, he proves the same thing when he needs to get his hands on some decent microphones and he uses Nola (Taryn Manning), as a human ATM, which she finds objectionable to his surprise.  For every step forward towards his dream there seems to be one backwards.  Is he making progress towards his dream or is everything a just a cruel illusion before his life bottoms out?Despite the rampant political incorrectness and obscenity of his lyrics, the creation of Djay's rap song is compelling and dare I say infectious (if you find yourself standing up and waving your arm around while chanting ""Whomp that trick,"" do not be surprised).  The other big moment comes when Djay discovers that making the demo tape is only half the battle, because he still has to get it into the hands of Skinny Black.  The man has skills, but such things might not matter in the world he lives in, let alone the one he is trying to enter.  As Djay says in a sober moment of clarity, ""I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar out of a dime, and I ain't even got a cent man.""""Hustle & Flow"" deserves to be remembered for more than Howard's performance and the Oscar nominated song with the dirtiest lyrics of all-time, but those will be the focal points.  The film is Howard's star turn and the situation is somewhat reminiscent of when Morgan Freeman was nominated for ""Street Smart,"" although it is hard to imagine Howard or anyone going to on a career that sees them playing the President and God as Freeman has done.  But Howard also has a strong performance in ""Crash"" under his belt this past year and has clearly moved up the Hollywood list and is going to stay there (Howard will not win tomorrow night, but in a year where three of the nominees are doing famous real people and the other's role is based on what he does not say, this is the standout performance).  The subject matter of this film will be enough to deter many from ever seeing it (to wit, my wife), but those who do will find it memorable.",5,Trying to squeeze a dollar out of a dime when you ain't even got a cent,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,4209,"['Hustle', 'Flow', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'pimp', 'pusher', 'named', 'Djay', 'fact', 'Howard', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'indication', 'Djay', 'not', 'ordinary', 'pimp', 'pusher', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'argument', 'Djay', 'noble', 'figure', 'certainly', 'nobility', 'desire', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'life', 'have', 'certain', 'rhetorical', 'flair', 'even', 'eloquence', 'when', 'not', 'spouting', 'rap', 'lyrics', 'written', 'down', 'little', 'notebook', 'Howard', 'performance', 'as', 'memorable', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'year', 'certainly', 'major', 'part', 'what', 'character', 'compelling', 'writer-director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'Poor', 'Hungry', 'credit', 'well.So', 'story', 'Djay', 'come', 'conclusion', 'are', 'better', 'things', 'be', 'world', 'pimp', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'Ludacris', 'big', 'rap', 'star', 'coming', 'back', 'Memphis', 'hood', 'visit', 'where', 'got', 'start', 'club', 'run', 'Arnel', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'Djay', 'do', 'put', 'demo', 'tape', 'hands', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'star', 'Djay', 'make', 'demo', 'tape', 'hands', 'digital', 'keyboard', 'out', 'stuff', 'play', 'Key', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'who', 'usually', 'records', 'church', 'music', 'Shelby', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'who', 'enough', 'rap', 'music', 'least', 'make', 'part', 'sound', 'good', 'So', 'Key', 'staples', 'cardboard', 'egg', 'containers', 'walls', 'Djay', 'dining', 'room', 'make', 'do-it-yourself', 'soundproof', 'recording', 'studio', 'try', 'see', 'Djay', 'lyrics', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'played', 'radio', 'Fortunately', 'Shug', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'hooker', 'up', 'hook', 'song', 'Hard', 'Out', 'Here', 'Pimp', 'else', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performance', 'nominated', 'song', 'going', 'present', 'interesting', 'problems', 'say', 'least.There', 'key', 'moment', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'when', 'Djay', 'microphones', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'sound', 'coming', 'neighbor', 'house', 'Djay', 'go', 'ask', 'nicely', 'consideration', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'make', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'However', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'get', 'hands', 'decent', 'microphones', 'Nola', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'human', 'ATM', 'objectionable', 'surprise', 'step', 'forward', 'dream', 'there', 'be', 'one', 'backwards', 'making', 'progress', 'towards', 'dream', 'everything', 'just', 'cruel', 'illusion', 'life', 'bottoms', 'out', 'rampant', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'obscenity', 'lyrics', 'creation', 'Djay', 'rap', 'song', 'compelling', 'dare', 'say', 'infectious', 'find', 'standing', 'up', 'waving', 'arm', 'chanting', 'Whomp', 'trick', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'other', 'big', 'moment', 'when', 'Djay', 'making', 'demo', 'tape', 'only', 'battle', 'still', 'get', 'hands', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'man', 'skills', 'such', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'matter', 'world', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'trying', 'enter', 'Djay', 'sober', 'moment', 'clarity', ""'m"", 'here', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'dollar', 'dime', 'ai', ""n't"", 'even', 'got', 'cent', 'man', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'be', 'remembered', 'more', 'Howard', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'song', 'dirtiest', 'lyrics', 'all-time', 'will', 'be', 'focal', 'points', 'film', 'Howard', 'star', 'turn', 'situation', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'when', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'nominated', 'Street', 'Smart', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Howard', 'anyone', 'going', 'career', 'playing', 'President', 'God', 'Freeman', 'done', 'Howard', 'also', 'strong', 'performance', 'Crash', 'belt', 'past', 'year', 'clearly', 'moved', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'list', 'going', 'stay', 'there', 'Howard', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'year', 'where', 'three', 'nominees', 'are', 'doing', 'famous', 'real', 'people', 'other', 'role', 'based', 'what', 'not', 'say', 'standout', 'performance', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'deter', 'many', 'ever', 'seeing', 'wit', 'wife', 'who', 'do', 'will', 'find', 'memorable']",Hustle & Flow

942832,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000BITUWU,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 9]","We all think we know about pimps.  They're bad guys.  Right?Well, not exactly.Hustle and Flow is one of those films that takes all our preconceived notions and turns them upside down.  No wonder Terrance Howard, who's cast as a Dijay, a Memphis small-time pimp. He and his women live in a run-down house in Memphis and he doesn't make big bucks or drive a nice car. Just like everyone else, he struggles to stay alive.  But he has a dream. He wants to be a rap singer.  At first I thought this would be a predictible story.  I was wrong.  And I must admire the screenwriter/director Craig Brewer for bringing this very real story to the screen, resulting in an Academy Award for the music and a nomination for best actor for Terrance Howard.The cast of characters is great.  The three women in his life are very very real.  There's the pretty white girl who can't see a way out of her life, the pregnant woman who loves him and is full of fear, the sassy stripper with the young child who is angry all the time.  Their relationships with each other and with their pimp are complex and human.  And then there is his friend, Key, who's a churchgoer and whose wife works as a supervisor in a department store.  They lead a very middle class life.  But when Key starts to help Djay record a demo, his comfortable marriage is thrown into chaos. Rounding out the cast of people helping to produce the demo is a skinny white guy, DJ Qualls, who's an expert in the technical aspects of recording and who loves to get high all the time.Finally the demo is ready and Djay tries to get a former acquaintance help him out.  The rap star Ludicrous is cast in this role which calls for him to be an actor as well as a musician.  How this all plays out is unexpected and violent.

Whilst I loved his acting and much of the rest of the cast, I didn't absolutely love the movie itself.  It was good, but too raw and gritty for my taste.

I heard about it when the song ""It's Hard Out Here For a Pimp"" won an Oscar for Best Original Song and Terrence Howard got a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading role.  Still, the film looked like a thug rapper movie ala Get Rich or Die Trying.  But I was completely blown away by the screenplay, the story, the acting, and the sensitive and kind heart of this movie.The story is about a pimp named DJ.  DJ is not a typical pimp who beats his girls and raps about it.  He does babysitting duty and tries to have philosophical discussions with them.  Of course he is not perfect, as we will see.  Two of his three girls are sweet, one is abrasive.  Nola is a shy country girl who suffers from low self-esteem and depression.  Shug (Sugar) is eight months pregnant by an unknown john.  DJ runs into Key (Anthony Anderson), an old high school friend.  They start to make a rap demo, to the dismay of Yevette, Key's wife.We can see that this dream means everything to DJ and Key.  The fibres of their heart and soul are tied to this project.  How his little ""family"" becomes involved is great.  You end up holding your breath for all of these characters.

942842,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BITUWU,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""Hustle & Flow"" is a celebration of Southern hip-hop, specifically Memphis ""crunk"", by writer, director, and Memphis native Craig Brewer. DJay (Terrence Howard) is a philosophical pimp who hustles Nola (Taryn Manning) out of his car while his other lady Shug (Taraji B. Henson) is pregnant and out of commission. DJay is a consummate hustler whose way with words could sell anyone on anything, but he never had much ambition beyond his daily grind. A mid-life crisis changes that. DJay feels the pull of music and decides to start taking songwriting seriously. He convinces straight-laced Clyde (Anthony Anderson), nicknamed ""Key"", an audio engineer whom he knew in high school, to record his  demo. They set up a makeshift studio, and, with the help of astute musician Shelby (D.J. Qualls), they set out to make some music. Pretty soon everyone involved is hanging his or her dreams on DJay's music.At first, ""Hustle & Flow"" looked to me like a stylish, grungy take on the poor man makes good theme -and it is, but not in the sense I had first thought. DJay isn't a guy who raps his way out of the urban ghetto. This is a Southern film with a strong regional identity in the tradition of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" or ""Honkytonk Man"", except this is Memphis, not Nashville, and crunk, not country music. It thankfully lacks the unbridled optimism and saccharine quality of films like ""8 Mile"". ""Hustle & Flow"" is optimistic -adamant, in fact- about people's ability to express their culture and experience in great music, but not necessarily optimistic about people themselves. It's not a Cinderella story. But it's one of 2005's best films, because its characters are so full of life and its environment so vivid.Terrence Howard is absolutely electrifying as DJay. He makes this lowlife pimp with an interesting mind but a cruel temper into a star. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. And the rest of the cast does no less. Even Yevette (Elise Neal), Clyde's proper bourgeois wife, jumps off the screen with her tales of job woes. ""Hustle & Flow"" doesn't condescend to her any more than it does to the hookers and hustlers. Nola and Shug are emotionally needy people who allow themselves to be pimped in exchange for affirmation of self-worth or assurance of dominance, respectively. These actresses embrace their roles without melodrama or angst. And ""Hustle & Flow"" resists the obvious temptation to make them weak.""Hustle & Flow"" was shot in 23 days on digital video. Fortunately, it doesn't look like it. It looks like DV, but not shoddy DV. Kudos to cinematographer Amy Vincent for that. I see about 100 new films a year, and ""Hustle & Flow"" is one of few stand-outs from 2006. For one thing, it isn't something I've seen a hundred times before -although the trailer might lead you to think that it is. Craig Brewer has really captured the flavor of a particular place, time, and type of music. Terrence Howard deserves an Oscar nomination, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that he got one. I've rarely seen such a charismatic and electrifying transformation.The DVD (Paramount 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, footage of the movie premiere, promotional spots, and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Hustle"" (26 min) features interviews with writer/director Craig Brewer, producer Stephanie Allain, producer John Singleton, who funded the film, and the cast. They discuss characters, casting, and themes. ""Creatin' Crunk"" (13 min) is about the film's score, which features some of the original Stax players from the 1970s.  Composer Scott Bomar talks about the score and its influences. ""By Any Means Necessary"" (14 min) is about the struggles to get the film made. ""Memphis Hometown Premiere"" (5 min) includes interviews with the film's stars at the premiere and a declaration by Memphis' Mayor to make July 6, 2005 ""Hustle & Flow Day"". ""Promotional Spots"" (4 min) are 6 short spots in which the actors promote the film intercut with footage from the movie.

Prostitution is what it is but a movie with a pimp as the central character? I don't mind saying it on record that I hold nothing but contempt for the men who live off the earnings of the women they exploit.But I'm a huge fan of Terrence Howard and had heard that the movie had won the Audience Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and was even Oscar nominated (for best actor in a leading role and best original song). As we all now know, Terrence lost out on the former to Philip Seymour Hoffman but ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"" shocked many by taking the golden statuette.I decided to buy the DVD in the end because the movie didn't screen in my area, as far as I was aware, and my local video store wasn't holding it.Well, I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I'm really glad I bought it and look forward to watching it over and over again. I guess, as with the last movie I reviewed here, it just goes to show how a good script, good direction and good acting can make good art out of any story, infuse it with humanity and move us.Yes, it's true, Djay is a pimp but he seems to be a pimp with heart. He not only takes care of his girls, he actually seems to care about them. They definitely care about him, especially the lovely Nola (played by Taryn Manning) who takes care of business when Djay finds himself behind bars, and ensures that his dream of becoming a successful rapper is kept alive and well. The story, probably from start to end was pretty predictable but thoroughly entertaining nevertheless. Howard brings complexity and magnetism to what could've been a cardboard cut-out role.Good support from the always watchable Anthony Anderson and D.J. Qualls was mouth open wide astounding. I'd never even heard of him before this movie but will be looking out for him now.And to round it all off the movie has a banging soundtrack. I may be a bit late but I'm definitely beginning to feel southern hip-hop. ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"" deserved the Academy Award it won.

942852,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BITUWU,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Terrance Howard earned a well-deserved Best Actor nomination for his strong performance in ""Hustle and Flow,"" a modern urban fairy tale about a two-bit drug dealer and pimp who dreams of making something better of his life.  ""D-Jay,"" a singer/songwriter who long ago gave up his ambition of hitting it big in the music business, barely ekes out a living selling dope and pimping cheap hookers in his rundown Memphis neighborhood.  Lately, he's been suffering from what he himself calls a ""mid life crisis,"" as the realization has begun to dawn on him that his life is going nowhere fast.  By chance, he runs into a high school acquaintance with some recording equipment who agrees to hook up with him and start cutting some records.  But will D-Jay be able to break into an industry that seems closed to all but a select few hardworking and lucky enough to break down the doors?Although Howard hits all the right notes in his performance, the movie itself is never quite as good as he is in it.  As written and directed by Craig Brewer, the film lacks the authenticity and grit that a sturdier, more seasoned hand (a Spike Lee, for instance) might have brought to it.  The scenes often have an air of contrivance about them, as if Brewer didn't trust the audience to get the meaning without his spelling it all out for us.  The storyline often veers dangerously close to melodrama (as in D-Jay's encounter with a big star hip-hop artist) and the dialogue often has that overly explicit, self-revelatory quality that makes it sound forced, unconvincing and phony.  Moreover, with the exception of Howard, the acting is woefully uneven and even downright amateurish at times.  One admires what Brewer is trying to do in the film - providing a sort of upbeat antidote to all the downbeat urban black dramas we are always being subjected to these days - but ""Hustle and Flow"" never manages to convince us of its own authenticity.Still, the movie is worth checking out for Howard's acting, which is indeed rich, varied and amazingly subtle at times, and for some nice moments of emotion and insight scattered along the way.",3,not bad but the movie never rises to the level of Howard's performance,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2118,"['Terrance', 'Howard', 'earned', 'well-deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'strong', 'performance', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'modern', 'urban', 'fairy', 'tale', 'two-bit', 'drug', 'dealer', 'pimp', 'who', 'making', 'something', 'better', 'life', 'D-Jay', 'singer/songwriter', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', 'ambition', 'hitting', 'big', 'music', 'business', 'barely', 'out', 'living', 'selling', 'dope', 'pimping', 'cheap', 'hookers', 'rundown', 'Memphis', 'neighborhood', 'Lately', 'been', 'suffering', 'what', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'realization', 'begun', 'dawn', 'life', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'chance', 'high', 'school', 'acquaintance', 'recording', 'equipment', 'who', 'hook', 'up', 'start', 'cutting', 'records', 'will', 'D-Jay', 'be', 'able', 'break', 'industry', 'closed', 'select', 'few', 'hardworking', 'lucky', 'enough', 'break', 'down', 'doors', 'Howard', 'right', 'notes', 'performance', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'written', 'directed', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'film', 'authenticity', 'grit', 'sturdier', 'more', 'seasoned', 'hand', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'instance', 'might', 'have', 'brought', 'scenes', 'often', 'have', 'air', 'contrivance', 'Brewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'audience', 'get', 'meaning', 'spelling', 'out', 'storyline', 'often', 'dangerously', 'close', 'melodrama', 'D-Jay', 'encounter', 'big', 'star', 'hip-hop', 'artist', 'dialogue', 'often', 'overly', 'explicit', 'self-revelatory', 'quality', 'sound', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'phony', 'Moreover', 'exception', 'Howard', 'acting', 'woefully', 'uneven', 'even', 'downright', 'amateurish', 'times', 'One', 'what', 'Brewer', 'trying', 'do', 'film', 'providing', 'sort', 'upbeat', 'antidote', 'downbeat', 'urban', 'black', 'dramas', 'are', 'always', 'being', 'subjected', 'days', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'never', 'convince', 'own', 'authenticity.Still', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'Howard', 'acting', 'indeed', 'rich', 'varied', 'amazingly', 'subtle', 'times', 'nice', 'moments', 'emotion', 'insight', 'scattered', 'way']",Hustle & Flow
942853,A3FNZQU6KBXWLM,B000BITUWU,Scott Delo,"[20, 21]","I'm not much of a rap fan but I picked this one up on a lark after hearing some of the good things that have been said lately about Terrence Howard. I can honestly say it is one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I think Howard is on his way to becoming a top-tier Hollywood actor.The story centers on a pimp and drug dealer named Djay, played by Howard. Djay is sleepwalking his way through life until fate taps him on the shoulder. He is given an old Casio keyboard for a dime bag of pot and he runs into an old buddy of his who is now a recording studio technician. The two things light a spark in Djay and he decides to take a shot at being a rapper. Using egg boxes to soundproof a room in his rundown house and using his whores for backup singers, Djay creates magic.The movie manages to make a pimp into a sympathetic character, which is an accomplishment on its own right. But the movie isn't really about pimps any more than it's about whores or drug dealers. In fact, it's not even about black or white. The only two white characters in the movie are one of Djay's whores and a geeky keyboards guy and they are both shown in a fairly positive light.

He gets inspiration from his favorite girl Nora, played by Manning, and help to record a demo in his broken down home from another one of his girls, a pregnant woman with a soulful voice, and local sound mixers and technicians, played by Anderson and Qualls. He finds out that local rap star Skinny Black, played by real life rap star Ludacris, is coming to town so he sets up a plan to meet him, give him his demo tape, and make it to the big time.Hustle And Flow succeeds in engaging the audience with its main character's dilemma.

The movie blew me away.  This is very much a universal film in that, ultimately, it's about our hopes and our need to create something extraordinary as a testament of our sojourn here.  Realizing that he is the same age as his father when he passed away, low level pimp and drug dealer DJay decides, with the help of an old school buddy, now gospel producer, to pursue his long-time ambition of becoming a rapper, following in the footsteps of local-guy-made-good Skinny Black (played by Ludacris).  What made this a very moving experience was that Craig Brewer didn't attempt to either praise nor condemn his characters but rather create wholly credible people, warts and all, that resonate within everyone because, in the end, it's about wanting to better yourself, to realize a dream, to achieve something extraordinary, to be respected and to leave your mark on the world, regardless of how insignificant it may seem to everyone else.  None of these characters may come across as necessarily likeable but dang if they aren't believable and it's due to that that their personal trials and misgivings impact the viewer.  The character of Nola was, for me, the living, heartbreaking embodiment of lost youth, desperation and wasted innocence; a person knowing they were meant for greater things but not knowing what that is and how to escape the drudgery of her existence and be part of something special.  We see how she practically glows with self-confidence when in her small way she contributes to DJay's dreams.  Terrence Howard delivers a nuanced, heartfelt and eloquent performance as DJay, with Taryn Manning as Nola, bringing a profound humanity to a country girl caught in her own life. Taraji Henson is perfect as Shug, a weary yet confident reflection of D Jay's dreams and Paula Jai Parker is equally impressive as Lexus, the walking manifestation of bitterness and resentment, throwing her vitriol in the face of everyone's hopes. Anthony Anderson and D.J.
