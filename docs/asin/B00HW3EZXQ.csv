It&#8217;s a complete bloodbath; I went in not expecting much, but you&#8217;ve got to give the director credit, the script is pretty damn good and the 3D is magnificent.

At first I thought de la Huerta was a man in drag, I hate to sound cruel but she looks like a man in some parts of the movie. Anyway, Abby meets a new nurse & beguns a deadly realtionship with her. The opening credits are neat & the whole movie was enjoyable overall, I wanted to view it again after watching it. I would welcome a sequel if de la Huerta returns.

Quite the contrary, in fact.  NURSE 3D is a slick horror film that does not disappoint, especially when it comes to tension.  And despite its simple title, there&#8217;s nothing simple about this movie.I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect going into this one.  I had heard mixed things about it, which always piques my interest even more.  And my buddy Hayes over at Hayes Hudson's House of Horror called it a must-see, so I knew I had to give it a shot.  And I&#8217;m glad I did&#8230;this is one heck of a horror flick!NURSE looks stunning onscreen, from the way it is shot to the graphic imagery throughout.  I am very impressed with the cinematography, especially considering this is a 3D movie; many times, the film style suffers because of the 3D aspect.  Not so here.  This film looks amazing in almost every aspect.  And there&#8217;s nothing like seeing phenomenal three-dimensional blood-sprays!The acting in NURSE is very good.  Although Paz de la Huerta has top-billing, and she does a great job, there are several other cast members worth note.  One that sticks out specifically to me is Katrina Bowden who portrays Danni.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed Bowden&#8217;s work since TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL, and I hope to see more of her in future productions.The special effects in NURSE are excellent, and there&#8217;s plenty of carnage to satiate the heartiest of gore-hounds.  La Huera&#8217;s character Abby doles out murder and mayhem aplenty, and the body count rises along the way.  I like the visceral use of blood-sprays, especially captured in 3D.  This is the way horror is meant to be experienced!NURSE is a heck of a good time, and I recommend giving it a look.  It&#8217;s chocked full of crazy fun, so be ready for a thrill-ride.  And be sure to watch it in 3D if you get the chance; you won&#8217;t be sorry.",5,Beautiful and dangerous!,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1935,"['Don', '8217', 'let', 'seductive', 'cover', 'movie', 'fool', 'nurse', 'NOT', 'want', 'help', 'get', 'better', 'contrary', 'fact', '3D', 'slick', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'especially', 'when', 'tension', 'simple', 'title', '8217', 'nothing', 'simple', 'movie.I', 'wasn', '8217', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'one', 'had', 'heard', 'mixed', 'things', 'always', 'piques', 'interest', 'even', 'more', 'buddy', 'Hayes', 'Hayes', 'Hudson', 'House', 'Horror', 'called', 'must-see', 'knew', 'had', 'give', 'shot', '8217', 'glad', 'did', '8230', 'one', 'heck', 'horror', 'flick', 'NURSE', 'stunning', 'onscreen', 'way', 'shot', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'considering', '3D', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'style', 'suffers', '3D', 'aspect', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'film', 'amazing', 'almost', 'aspect', '8217', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'phenomenal', 'three-dimensional', 'blood-sprays', 'acting', 'NURSE', 'very', 'good', 'Paz', 'de', 'la', 'Huerta', 'top-billing', 'great', 'job', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'worth', 'note', 'One', 'out', 'specifically', 'Katrina', 'Bowden', 'who', 'Danni', '8217', 'enjoyed', 'Bowden', '8217', 'work', 'TUCKER', 'DALE', 'VS', 'EVIL', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'future', 'productions.The', 'special', 'effects', 'NURSE', 'are', 'excellent', 'there', '8217', 's', 'plenty', 'carnage', 'satiate', 'heartiest', 'gore-hounds', 'La', 'Huera', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Abby', 'out', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'aplenty', 'body', 'count', 'way', 'visceral', 'use', 'blood-sprays', 'especially', 'captured', '3D', 'way', 'horror', 'meant', 'be', 'experienced', 'NURSE', 'heck', 'good', 'time', 'recommend', 'giving', 'look', '8217', 'chocked', 'full', 'crazy', 'fun', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'thrill-ride', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', '3D', 'get', 'chance', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'sorry']",Nurse
1692704,A3HNBLO0KIJVTS,B00HW3EZXQ,"paper tiger ""Adriel August""","[0, 1]","I took a chance on this because I like low budget cheesy horror movies. This movie is not the best due to over-simplified acting and semi-cheesy story telling. The directing and cinematography could have been much better, but over-all it was fun. For what they were going for, they pulled it off well.3D was decent for this type of movie, yet it wasn't always perfect (2D & 3D are both on the same disc). The PQ was good, but many scenes could have been sharper and clearer. AQ was pretty good as wellExtras are a bit light, but for this type of movie I wouldn't really want to see anything more. If you liked the simple style movies like Midnight Meat Train, My Bloody Valentine 3D or Freddy vs. Jason's silly style acting and directing, you'll probably like Nurse 3D.I don't regret Blind buying it, so I guess that's a good sign. But it is violent and there is plenty of nudity. I didn't like all the fake blood and special effects, and after a while it just gets to be a bit ridiculous, however that's what they were going for.I recommend a rent or stream before I would recommend a purchase.

She saves lives and gets along with everyone. At night she looks for cheating men, seduces them then kills them. Everything is going fine until Danni (Bowden), a young nurse, shows up. What starts off as a friendship starts to become scary for Danni and when she finds out Abby's secret it could become deadly. This is a movie where there really isn't much to say. Very predictable and generic. The deaths aren't that inventive or original and the movie really uses nudity and sex as a way to keep the viewer interested, for example during the exposition scenes Abby walks around totally bottomless. This isn't a terrible movie because I have seen worse but really this is nothing that original or exciting. Horror fans may like this but this was a little too generic for me to get totally invested in.
