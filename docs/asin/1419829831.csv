175660,A27N36BPXB2EKB,1419829831,80sGuy,"[57, 59]","We first saw ""A Little Princess"" on HBO and knew right away that it's a ""must add"" DVD to our collection, even better...a DVD with two of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classics. Any adult can relate to the two movies here and the stories are beautifully told on film adapted from the books. There are other versions which we haven't see and am pretty sure they're all as good. My girlfriend became very emotional [about Sarah Crewe] and loved it (she's a kid at heart) I'm glad she did, because essentially, I wanted this movie for her because she is my little princess.The double-featured disc is a great value, but a widescreen format would be a good option, there isn't one despite the description from the case stated that there is both full-screen & widescreen versions: this is pretty misleading because I believe the two formats were meant for the 'Theatrical Trailers' and NOT for the movie if you read carefully along the print. Also, printed inside on the center hub of the disc, it states that both versions are 'Full Screen', by then this is too late to sort out the confusion if you are very particular about having the widescreen format...so I'll minus one star for this making a total 4 out of 5.",4,Beautiful!,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,1207,"['first', 'saw', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'HBO', 'knew', 'right', 'away', 'must', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'even', 'better', 'DVD', 'two', 'Frances', 'Hodgson', 'Burnett', 'classics', 'adult', 'can', 'relate', 'two', 'movies', 'here', 'stories', 'are', 'beautifully', 'told', 'film', 'adapted', 'books', 'are', 'other', 'versions', 'have', ""n't"", 'see', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', ""'re"", 'good', 'girlfriend', 'became', 'very', 'emotional', '[', 'Sarah', 'Crewe', ']', 'loved', 'kid', 'heart', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'essentially', 'wanted', 'movie', 'little', 'princess.The', 'double-featured', 'disc', 'great', 'value', 'widescreen', 'format', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'option', ""n't"", 'one', 'description', 'case', 'stated', 'full-screen', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'pretty', 'misleading', 'believe', 'two', 'formats', 'were', 'meant', ""'Theatrical"", 'Trailers', 'NOT', 'movie', 'read', 'carefully', 'print', 'Also', 'printed', 'inside', 'center', 'hub', 'disc', 'versions', 'are', ""'Full"", 'Screen', 'then', 'too', 'late', 'sort', 'out', 'confusion', 'are', 'very', 'particular', 'having', 'widescreen', 'format', 'so', ""'ll"", 'minus', 'one', 'star', 'making', 'total', '4', '5']",N/A

Like most apparent bargains, there is a catch.The Secret Garden.  Whether you've read the book or not, the BBC version (3 and a half hours long) is by far the best movie version of all four versions.  The characters, scenery, accents, music--all are priceless.  And it also follows the book.  Every child deserves to see this movie.  This version has just been released on DVD.A Little Princess.  If you've read the book A Little Princess, you're going to be disappointed in this movie.  The movie throws the book away.  If you haven't read the book, it's not a bad children's movie.  But there is a better movie of A Little Princess which also throws the book away: the 1939 Shirley Temple version (which is available on DVD for only $4.99).If you HAVE read the book, A Little Princess, you have only one choice: the Wonderworks version from the late 1970s.  This version is excellent in every way (except for the casting of the main character), an English ambience, excellent casting of all the other characters, superb acting, good music, etc.  It is over two and a half hours long and follows the book very closely.  (Oddly enough, this version has just been re-released--on VHS!!!  Hasn't Wonderworks ever heard of DVD?)Bottom line: this DVD is not a bargain.  Get the 1975 version of The Secret Garden and wait for the Wonderworks version to come out on DVD.Warning: If you go for this deal and ever see one of the good movie versions someday, you're going to be very, very angry that you fell for this ""bargain.""",3,a bargain?,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1592,"['DVD', 'bargain', 'two', 'movies', 'price', 'one', 'most', 'apparent', 'bargains', 'catch.The', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Whether', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'not', 'BBC', 'version', '3', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'version', 'four', 'versions', 'characters', 'scenery', 'accents', 'music', 'are', 'priceless', 'also', 'book', 'child', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'DVD.A', 'Little', 'Princess', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Little', 'Princess', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'movie', 'book', 'away', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'not', 'bad', 'children', 'movie', 'better', 'movie', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'also', 'book', 'away', '1939', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'version', 'available', 'DVD', 'only', '4.99', '.If', 'HAVE', 'read', 'book', 'Little', 'Princess', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'choice', 'Wonderworks', 'version', 'late', '1970s', 'version', 'excellent', 'way', 'casting', 'main', 'character', 'English', 'ambience', 'excellent', 'casting', 'other', 'characters', 'superb', 'acting', 'good', 'music', 'etc', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'version', 'just', 'been', 're-released', 'VHS', 'Has', ""n't"", 'Wonderworks', 'ever', 'heard', 'DVD', 'Bottom', 'line', 'DVD', 'not', 'bargain', 'Get', '1975', 'version', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'wait', 'Wonderworks', 'version', 'come', 'out', 'DVD.Warning', 'go', 'deal', 'ever', 'see', 'one', 'good', 'movie', 'versions', 'someday', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'angry', 'fell', 'bargain']",N/A

We have grown to love the characters - Sara, her Papa, Becky, Amelia Minchin, and others. From thebeginning to the ending this film held our attention. Through all of her obstacles, her ""princess"" nature never obscures. Likeshe brought out to Miss Minchin, ""All girls are princesses! Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they dress in rags.Even if they aren't pretty or smart or young. They are still princesses - all of us! Didn't your father ever tell you that?Didn't he?"" Left in rags herself, and with little to eat, Sara and Becky pledge to look out for one another, and help eachother. Miss Minchin could never appreciate Sara from the time she clapped eyes upon her. She was jealous and envious of her.She was mean to her, and yet all this makes you feel for Sara and her emotions. Though this film is for girls especially, it ismy favourite. When she feels cheerful, we are happy. When she is sad or crying, we are too. A nice twist: her Papa is found inthe battle field, and taken to a hospital. Eventually, she and her Papa are reunited.Next, The Secret Garden, Miss Mary Lennox is hurried from the boat wharf or dock, to an ancient mansion - Mistlethwait Manour.She has never learned the simple things in life, due to her up-bringing in India. She now has to do things for herself. Shewas sour, just like her cousin Collin, upon arrival, and that disappears some as she: goes outside, skipping rope, finding theneglected garden, and becoming friends with Dickon. Medlock tries her best to help Collin, even though she is rather againstMary, and also takes off frustration on Martha. Martha and Dickon's kindness rubs off onto Mary and then onto Collin, as hefinds himself in the secret garden. The only person that knows of this is the gardener Mr Weatherstaff, who happened upon thethree friends in the forbidden garden. Slowly, the reclusive Uncle comes around, and discovers what Mary has done with ""A bitof earth."" Moreover, he finds his son, walking and in the middle of a game with Mary and Dickon in the garden. Mary then feelsleft out or unwanted, and learns to cry. Her Uncle, however, learns to laugh and love his son - and his niece. The entirestaff of Mistlethwait ends up discovering what the Uncle does - Collin is well as any boy in Yorkshire and Mary had helped itabout.Two great films in one.

175695,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1419829831,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","A Little PrincessThis adaptation of A Little Princess is refreshing and beautifully-filmed. Based upon the beloved children's classic, this adaptation begins with Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) regaling her Indian friend and Indian nanny with a mythological tale in Simla, India in 1914. Sara's father decides to send her to New York to study at the same boarding school attended by Sara's late mother. Given Sara's wealth, she is given a warm welcome by the haughty and greedy headmistress (Eleanor Bron) whilst Sara's father goes off to fight in the first world war.Sara's free-spiritedness is stifled by the domineering headmistress, and when tragedy strikes, Sara finds herself being kept on at the school in the capacity of a housemaid where she is treated abominably. Her only happiness comes from her flights of imagination, until Sara is finally able to find true happiness.The ending diverges from the book, but I felt this was ok given that the audience for such movies are usually young children. My kindergartner was satisfied with the happy ending, though we also know how the book ends (we read it prior to viewing the movie). The lead actress who plays Sara Crewe, Liesel Matthews credibly captures the strong will and determination of the spunky heroine. This is a family-friendly movie which will appeal mostly to young children.The Secret GardenThis adaptation of the beloved children's classic has a wonderful cast that brings the story to vivid life. Kate Maberly as the spoilt and bitter Mary Lennox delivers a finely nuanced performance. Heydon Prowse credibly portrays the role of the invalid Master Colin who is hungry for affection and attention. Andrew Knott delivers a suitably understated performance as the kind-hearted gardener, Dickon Sowerby. Of course there's Dame Maggie Smith in a smaller role than her usual prominent ones, playing the housekeeper.There is a magical, otherworldly quality to The Secret Garden that makes this a movie that will appeal to young and old alike.",5,Two wonderful and magical family-friendly films,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2008,"['Little', 'PrincessThis', 'adaptation', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'refreshing', 'beautifully-filmed', 'Based', 'beloved', 'children', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'Liesel', 'Matthews', 'regaling', 'Indian', 'friend', 'Indian', 'nanny', 'mythological', 'tale', 'Simla', 'India', '1914', 'Sara', 'father', 'send', 'New', 'York', 'study', 'same', 'boarding', 'school', 'attended', 'Sara', 'late', 'mother', 'Given', 'Sara', 'wealth', 'given', 'warm', 'welcome', 'haughty', 'greedy', 'headmistress', 'Eleanor', 'Bron', 'whilst', 'Sara', 'father', 'fight', 'first', 'world', 'war.Sara', 'free-spiritedness', 'stifled', 'domineering', 'headmistress', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Sara', 'being', 'kept', 'school', 'capacity', 'housemaid', 'where', 'treated', 'abominably', 'only', 'happiness', 'flights', 'imagination', 'Sara', 'finally', 'able', 'find', 'true', 'happiness.The', 'ending', 'diverges', 'book', 'felt', 'was', 'ok', 'given', 'audience', 'such', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'young', 'children', 'kindergartner', 'was', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'ending', 'also', 'know', 'how', 'book', 'read', 'prior', 'viewing', 'movie', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'Liesel', 'Matthews', 'credibly', 'strong', 'will', 'determination', 'spunky', 'heroine', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'young', 'children.The', 'Secret', 'GardenThis', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'children', 'classic', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'story', 'vivid', 'life', 'Kate', 'Maberly', 'spoilt', 'bitter', 'Mary', 'Lennox', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Heydon', 'Prowse', 'credibly', 'role', 'invalid', 'Master', 'Colin', 'who', 'hungry', 'affection', 'attention', 'Andrew', 'Knott', 'suitably', 'understated', 'performance', 'kind-hearted', 'gardener', 'Dickon', 'Sowerby', 'course', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'smaller', 'role', 'usual', 'prominent', 'ones', 'playing', 'housekeeper.There', 'magical', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'young', 'old', 'alike']",N/A
