There are three different sessions to choose from, AM Yoga, Stress Relief &amp; PM Yoga.  All three were much too simple.  The flowing poses in Stree Relief were nice but I didn't find them to relieve stress.  If you're inflexible and new to yoga then maybe this would be suitable but if you have any yoga experience, pass on this one.

514703,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00002EPXL,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[10, 10]","This DVD contains three very good yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners, particularly advanced beginners to intermediates. Although the practices are each labelled as being 20 minutes long, the actual times vary a bit: AM Yoga has a 4-minute breathing exercise followed by a 12-minute yoga program, PM Yoga is approximately 24 minutes, and Yoga for Stress Relief is about 16 minutes. All of these programs are very doable for those new to yoga, but they do assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent place to start).AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas. The simple breathing exercise helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other poses which follow help your body to awaken. The practice is led by Rodney Yee, an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person! PM Yoga is a very nice practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It also begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout or a quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, but her cuing is not quite as accurate as Rodney's; however, I enjoyed her practice the most.  My one disappointment with this DVD was the Stress Relief program by Suzanne Deason.  Although I thought that her voice was soothing and that she cued well, she moves so quickly from pose to pose that there's little opportunity to enjoy each posture. Furthermore, the use of props seems to hinder and further complicate this practice--if the workout moved at a slower pace, the props would be a nice addition, allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses, but because the transitions are so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned, leaving little time to relax in the poses.Overall, this video would be a good addition to your collection if you are looking for short, relaxing practices accessible to a wide range of levels.",4,A nice selection of three relaxing yoga practices,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2437,"['DVD', 'three', 'very', 'good', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'perfect', 'virtually', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'particularly', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'practices', 'are', 'labelled', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'actual', 'times', 'vary', 'bit', 'AM', 'Yoga', '4-minute', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'followed', '12-minute', 'yoga', 'program', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'approximately', '24', 'minutes', 'Yoga', 'Stress', 'Relief', '16', 'minutes', 'programs', 'are', 'very', 'doable', 'new', 'yoga', 'do', 'assume', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'poses', 'total', 'yoga', 'newbies', 'will', 'find', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Beginners', 'be', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', '.AM', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'so', 'gentle', ""'ve"", 'frequently', 'performed', 'first', 'waking', 'up', 'still', 'pajamas', 'simple', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'mind', 'focus', 'then', 'basic', 'twists', 'other', 'poses', 'follow', 'help', 'body', 'awaken', 'practice', 'led', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'who', 'flawless', 'cuing', 'who', 'extremely', 'calm', 'soothing', 'voice', 'ideal', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'morning', 'person', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'very', 'nice', 'practice', 'winding', 'down', 'relaxing', 'stretching', 'also', 'short', 'focus', 'breathing', 'encouraging', 'turn', 'attention', 'inward', 'where', 'quiet', 'practice', 'moves', 'seated', 'kneeling', 'position', 'also', 'traditional', 'standing', 'poses', 'such', 'warrior', 'lunges', 'great', 'end-of-day', 'workout', 'quick', 'practice', 'fit', 'anytime', 'need', 'relax', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'instructor', 'cuing', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'accurate', 'Rodney', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'most', 'one', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'was', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'program', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'thought', 'voice', 'was', 'soothing', 'cued', 'well', 'so', 'quickly', 'pose', 'pose', 'little', 'opportunity', 'enjoy', 'posture', 'Furthermore', 'use', 'props', 'hinder', 'further', 'complicate', 'practice', 'workout', 'moved', 'slower', 'pace', 'props', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'allowing', 'less', 'flexibility', 'attain', 'poses', 'transitions', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'worrying', 'where', 'props', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'positioned', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'relax', 'poses.Overall', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'collection', 'are', 'looking', 'short', 'relaxing', 'practices', 'accessible', 'wide', 'range', 'levels']","The All-Day Yoga Workout - A.M., Stress Relief, and P.M.

Now, let me start by saying that I have had three Rodney Yee tapes or DVDs and every single one was too hard for me to do.  Either he moves too fast from pose to pose, or he does poses that end up straining my back. The AM part of this is no exception. His poses are too difficult. The PM part of this is all right if I could do it more slowly but it's hard for me to keep up with the instructor. However, the DVD is worth it just for the Suzanne Deason part (Stress Relief) which is calming, easy on the body, and makes me feel good when I'm done.  (The AM and PM make me feel cramped and sore right away when I finish.)  So now all I do is the Stress Relief one.

514707,A38ZU5T1A1RNUO,B00002EPXL,Mike,"[26, 26]","The other reviews have offered ample reasons for purcasing this.  I would add that while the straps and blocks are needed, these can, if you wish, be fashioned from things you have around the house.  A nice wide terrycloth belt from an old robe makes a great strap, for example.If new to yoga, the best course would be to do Rodney Yee's A.M. Yoga for 21 days.  This will build a healthy habit that will help you more than you can realize.  Each of these lessons, by the way, are very well written and sensitively convey the benefit of the movements while expertly leading you through the actions.Suzanne Deeston's Yoga for Stress is more strenuous and is very effective.  A week or two into Rodney's A.M. session, you might want to begin with the Stress session after work.After a week or two of Yoga for Stress, you should be ready for the P.M. session.  But don't rush into it.  Take your time.If you do nothing other than wake up each morning and do A.M. Yoga, I believe you will find very pleasing results.

My wife and I used more than any other of this type, about 4 weeks....but then, for some reason it went on the stack with all the others. I can't really say why, because we both enjoyed it very much, and felt great each time we used it....I think writing this review gave me some extra motivation and I will start again. I was going to rate this a 4, but I got to this point and realized it was my own laziness that stopped me from continuing, so, I just changed it back to a 5. As far as these go, I have two from the series, and this is the better one, and by far better than anything else, including some of the bogus Tai Chi DVD's that I use to even out my poker table.
