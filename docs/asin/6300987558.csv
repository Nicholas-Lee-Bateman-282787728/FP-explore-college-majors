241166,A3J4ERRDGVKA8G,6300987558,A Customer,"[2, 3]","This movie portrays what many, many American males went through in high school. Being bullied. This movies not only puts to rest old demons that still sometimes haunt grown men when they think about high school (by seeing Jerry beat up the bully instead of the other way around), but it was so funny that I can't resist watching it whenever it is on cable! The crazy antics that occur in every high school in America (and abroad), are displayed by the nutty teachers, the rabid dogs that sometimes pass for school security guards, and the crazy girl that likes you for who you are so much that she wants to &quot;bond&quot; with you on a display table in the school store . It is excellent! I feel that a defining moment in the movie is when Jerry is in the bathroom, washing his face, deciding whether or not it was worth getting killed by standing up to the overgrown neanderthal, Buddy Rovell. Regardless of whether or not you like the movie, we are ALL overjoyed when Jerry decides to risk life and limb for personal honor!It is a fun movie, and I would suggest it to anyone.",5,Excellent.

241167,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6300987558,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[3, 3]","...Ogden High School: Ogden, Utah, 1987...Jerry Mitchell (Casey Siemaszko) is a nice, responsible 18 year-old boy with a lot going for him. He's a good student, he works for the school's newspaper, manages the school's supply store, drives to school, and has a strange, but attractive girlfriend. But today he didn't have a very good start: He overslept, the laundry wasn't finished (his parents are away for a few days), his car has a flat tire, and he nearly has a traffic accident driving his mother's car to school.And it only gets worse; as he arrives at class, rumors are floating around about the new kid at school. Buddy Revell (Richard Tyson) is a mean, oversized, very strong, EXTREMELY (!!!) frightening bully with a violent reputation. But to make him feel welcome at his new school, the editor of the school paper assigns Jerry Mitchell to interview him and do a fluff piece on him. Their conversation is a disaster, as everything he says and does only further antagonizes Revell. It ends with Revell challenging Mitchell to a fight after school at three o'clock, telling him he can't hide; it's a guaranteed blood-bath. (""...You sneak home, I'll be under your bed..."") No matter how hard he tries, Mitchell simply can not get out of it, and goes to more and more extreme measures to avoid the fight.  Thinking detention will get him out of the fight, for example, he gives a somewhat tasteless book report in English Literature class which is a highlight of the film. He does everything he thinks will land him in detention, but the outcome isn't quite what he expected. It's an excellent piece of comic irony.In the end, the showdown does happen; it's an obviously one-sided battle, and you could say Mitchell wins by merely showing up. Revell literally towers over him, so he is forced to grow a pair and stand up for himself in this terrifying situation. The fight is quite believable, as Mitchell suffers some painful injuries in the course of it, but he pulls on some hidden resources trying to hold his own, and regardless of the outcome (you'll have to watch to see for yourself), he earns the respect that was missing from his life up to this point.Throughout the film, watch all the little nuances, such as the film about insects during science class, the zooming close-ups of Jerry Mitchell as the moment draws near, and the frequent shots of the clocks throughout the day. You can see him becoming more and more afraid, understandably so, as three o'clock looms on the horizon.There aren't any of the expected extras in this disc, and some people have removed a star or two for it, but remember the days of VHS and before? The film speaks for itself, and as I say in my title, it was overlooked and underrated.A great sleeper.",5,Overlooked and underrated,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,2751,"['Ogden', 'High', 'School', 'Ogden', 'Utah', '1987', 'Jerry', 'Mitchell', 'Casey', 'Siemaszko', 'nice', 'responsible', '18', 'year-old', 'boy', 'lot', 'going', 'good', 'student', 'school', 'newspaper', 'school', 'supply', 'store', 'school', 'strange', 'attractive', 'girlfriend', 'today', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'start', 'overslept', 'laundry', 'was', ""n't"", 'finished', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'few', 'days', 'car', 'flat', 'tire', 'nearly', 'traffic', 'accident', 'driving', 'mother', 'car', 'school.And', 'only', 'worse', 'class', 'rumors', 'are', 'floating', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Buddy', 'Revell', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'mean', 'oversized', 'very', 'strong', 'EXTREMELY', 'frightening', 'bully', 'violent', 'reputation', 'make', 'feel', 'welcome', 'new', 'school', 'editor', 'school', 'paper', 'Jerry', 'Mitchell', 'interview', 'do', 'fluff', 'piece', 'conversation', 'disaster', 'everything', 'only', 'further', 'antagonizes', 'Revell', 'Revell', 'challenging', 'Mitchell', 'fight', 'school', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'guaranteed', 'blood-bath', 'sneak', 'home', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bed', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'Mitchell', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'extreme', 'measures', 'avoid', 'fight', 'Thinking', 'detention', 'will', 'get', 'fight', 'example', 'somewhat', 'tasteless', 'book', 'report', 'English', 'Literature', 'class', 'highlight', 'film', 'everything', 'will', 'land', 'detention', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'excellent', 'piece', 'comic', 'irony.In', 'end', 'showdown', 'happen', 'obviously', 'one-sided', 'battle', 'could', 'say', 'Mitchell', 'wins', 'merely', 'showing', 'up', 'Revell', 'literally', 'towers', 'forced', 'grow', 'pair', 'stand', 'up', 'terrifying', 'situation', 'fight', 'quite', 'believable', 'Mitchell', 'painful', 'injuries', 'course', 'hidden', 'resources', 'trying', 'hold', 'own', 'regardless', 'outcome', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'respect', 'was', 'missing', 'life', 'up', 'point.Throughout', 'film', 'watch', 'little', 'nuances', 'such', 'film', 'insects', 'science', 'class', 'zooming', 'close-ups', 'Jerry', 'Mitchell', 'moment', 'draws', 'frequent', 'shots', 'clocks', 'day', 'can', 'see', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'afraid', 'understandably', 'so', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'looms', 'horizon.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'expected', 'extras', 'disc', 'people', 'have', 'removed', 'star', 'two', 'remember', 'days', 'VHS', 'film', 'speaks', 'say', 'title', 'was', 'overlooked', 'underrated.A', 'great', 'sleeper']",N/A

Their first encounter was in one of the mens' restrooms. Buddy doesn't anyone to know about his violent past. Jerry's buddy Vincent Costello studies the combination to Buddy's locker and places a switchblade in the locker in an effort to get Buddy expelled. The switchblade was about to be removed but Vincent messed up the second time opening the locker. Jerry works as a clerk in the student store and in one scene steals $450 from the cash register to give to another student friend,Craig Mattey. Craig accepted the payment and as a favor to Jerry,half-angrily warns Buddy in the library to leave Jerry alone. Craig ended up with two molars punched out and broken finger. Vincent and Jerry's sister Brie get $350 of the money back. Craig was gonna repay it all but Vincent felt Craig deserved $100 for doing the favor for Jerry. During the pep rally,Jerry unsuccessfully leaves the school campus(he is met by a tough security guard who sends him to Voytek Dolinski,the Dean of Discipline). Jerry and Buddy are sent to principal Bill O'Rourke's office for cheating on a math test. After a few attempts,Jerry finally dissuades Buddy from fighting each other. Jerry pays Buddy the $350 that was earlier recovered by Vincent and Brie. ""You're the biggest sissy I ever met in my life!"",Buddy tells Jerry. After some brief thinking,Jerry comes back to Buddy,demanding the money back and the fight goes on as planned. It's now 3 PM,and it's Jerry vs. Buddy. Every student surrounds the pair. Buddy destroys the camera that is videotaping the fight. He even knocks out the security guard. Brie supplies Jerry with brass knuckles and Jerry knocks Buddy out cold with them! Everybody cheers,Jerry's girlfriend kisses him,followed by more cheers. In the final scene,it's the next school day,and everybody is talking about the Jerry vs. Buddy fight.

241171,AI46E73DWKD2B,6300987558,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","THREE O'CLOCK HIGH (1987) is rightfully being discovered as one of the true best 1980s high school comedies. The film, directed by Phil Joanou, boasts a surrealistic visual style and cinematography that makes it stand out among the typical 80s fare. It uses a lot of tracking, zoom-in, jump-cut, and angular shots to accentuate the film's action and give it a tense feel. At it's core, Three O'Clock High is a modern day fusion of ""High Noon"" and ""David and Goliath"".Set during one weekday at a high school in a remote unnamed Utah town, the story unfolds as we are introduced to under-the-radar senior Jerry Mitchell (superbly played by Casey Siemaszko), who begins this tortuous day running late for school, as he must get there to open the bookstore. Jerry is introduced as a fidgety, put-upon nerdy type, with a cool, feisty younger sister (wonderfully played by Stacey Glick), an oddball, yet rather attractive ""girlfriend"" (sublimely played by Anne Ryan), and a super-geeky best friend (well played by Jonathan Wise).In a defining early sequence, the film sets the stage for the introduction of one of the scariest, most mercurial characters in all of 80s teen movies, the troubled ""bully"" Buddy Revell (brillilantly played by Richard Tyson, his greatest film role). In this scene, an extended tracking sequence, several cliques of students (cheerleaders, rebels, nerds, jocks, etc.) are followed around and transitioned to as they all relay various nefarious tales about the intimidating Revell, who has just transferred from another local high school. This scene is a wonderful way to make Buddy larger-than-life to the viewer, so that when we get an actual view of Buddy's wrath, it's all the more scary!The plot of the film is that Jerry gets coaxed into trying to do a story for the school paper on Buddy, but things go horribly wrong during their first encounter, and Buddy ends up wanting to fight Jerry at 3 o'clock! During the course of the day, Jerry tries everything under the sun to get himself out of this predicament, which results in a snowball effect, and by the end of the day, Jerry must face his greatest fear. But along the way, a series of cathartic moments occur that instill Jerry with a previously untapped confidence and self-worth, in particular, several ""manly"" experiences with female characters.During the course of the day, several memorable adult characters are also introduced: straight-laced bookstore owner Mr. Rice (earnestly played by comic actor Jeffrey Tambor), school dean Dolinski (menacing Charles Macaulay), school security guard Duke (hilariously played by Mitch Pileggi), suspicious local police detective Mulvahill (commandingly played by Philip Baker Hall), sexually repressed English teacher Miss Farmer (beautiful Caitlin O'Heaney), and finally school principal Mr. O'Rourke (excellently played by John P. Ryan). All these stern adult figures serve to perfectly counter the film's core teens, providing a much welcome balance.  While the film at times presents itself with an almost surrealistic quality, there is an undeniable truth to many of the character traits displayed by the actors.There are also several scene-stealing teen characters, including a beret-wearing student who spreads word of the imminent after-school showdown all the while betting on Jerry's chances of survival, a couple of annoying film student wannabes that follow Jerry around all day with their camera, and the school's most popular girl, the enigmatic Karen Clarke (played with a perfectly detached edge by Liza Morrow).Joanou crafts a unique film in that Three O'Clock High is not the standard, cheesy 80s teen fare. By injecting groundbreaking cinematography, daring to incorporate elements of more revered films and stories into this tale, casting actors who inhabit their characters, and underscoring the film with a real sense of humor, he has fashioned a movie that has held up amazingly over time and is being recognized as a true standout from the 80s. I own a copy of the dvd, which is of great quality.

All that tension being felt as I approached the front doors of the school every single morning, the constant being picked on that took place, all the sweating and waiting until the end of the school day when the eventual fight was to end the daily conflicts and tormenting...How I miss being a bully!  All that intense fear I would create deep inside those nerds was just plain *awesome* (kidding).All joking aside, there's plenty of words that were used in this film that take me back to my years of going to school in the 90's.  It makes me wonder if this movie was somewhat of an influence to how the kids talked to each other back then (using words amazon definitely won't let me say- sorry, if you've watched this film, I think you know what words I'm referring to anyway).I bet the writer who came up with this idea was someone who got picked on himself because this storyline is WAY too potentially accurate to be a coincidence.  As I mention above, the main character in the film is definitely quite geeky and gets involved in a confrontation with the school buy (unintentionally) inside a bathroom.  The bully is the new kid in school, who happens to have a past history of violence.  He then challenges the nerd to a fight at... ding ding ding!!  3 o'clock.The entire film is about how the nerdy kid does everything humanly possible in an attempt to get out of the fight, and all the amazing adventures he goes on,.The acting is really good, Richard Tyson plays a VERY convincing bully (though he was several years too old for high school when he starred in this movie) and the storyline may be hauntingly familiar for some of you out there.Don't be ashamed if you can relate to the main character either.  Every school across the country -perhaps even the world- had (and continues to have) bullies and nerds similar to how this movie portrays them... well, maybe not similar to the bully who goes a little TOO insane at times, but the geek character is definitely relatable, and that's why I believe this movie was written from a nerds point of view.A great movie that's amazingly entertaining (and familiar) from beginning to end.",5,school bullies,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,2234,"['Wow', 'watching', 'Three', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'brought', 'back', 'STRONG', 'memories', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'tension', 'being', 'felt', 'approached', 'front', 'doors', 'school', 'single', 'morning', 'constant', 'being', 'picked', 'took', 'place', 'sweating', 'waiting', 'end', 'school', 'day', 'when', 'eventual', 'fight', 'was', 'end', 'daily', 'conflicts', 'tormenting', 'How', 'miss', 'being', 'bully', 'intense', 'fear', 'would', 'create', 'deep', 'nerds', 'was', 'just', 'plain', '*awesome*', 'kidding', '.All', 'joking', 'aside', 'plenty', 'words', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'take', 'back', 'years', 'going', 'school', '90', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'influence', 'how', 'kids', 'talked', 'other', 'back', 'then', 'using', 'words', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'say-', 'sorry', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'words', ""'m"", 'referring', 'anyway', '.I', 'writer', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'got', 'picked', 'storyline', 'WAY', 'too', 'potentially', 'accurate', 'be', 'coincidence', 'mention', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'definitely', 'quite', 'geeky', 'involved', 'confrontation', 'school', 'buy', 'unintentionally', 'bathroom', 'bully', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'who', 'have', 'past', 'history', 'violence', 'then', 'nerd', 'fight', 'ding', 'ding', 'ding', '3', ""o'clock.The"", 'entire', 'film', 'how', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'everything', 'humanly', 'possible', 'attempt', 'get', 'fight', 'amazing', 'adventures', '.The', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'VERY', 'convincing', 'bully', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'starred', 'movie', 'storyline', 'may', 'be', 'hauntingly', 'familiar', 'out', 'there.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'ashamed', 'can', 'relate', 'main', 'character', 'either', 'Every', 'school', 'country', '-perhaps', 'even', 'world-', 'had', 'have', 'bullies', 'nerds', 'similar', 'how', 'movie', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'similar', 'bully', 'who', 'little', 'TOO', 'insane', 'times', 'geek', 'character', 'definitely', 'relatable', 'why', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'nerds', 'point', 'view.A', 'great', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'entertaining', 'familiar', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

They are simple and can exaggerate situations to a comedic point that is honestly funny.  Clearly, since we all can relate to some of the content we can find some ""truth"" in the humor.  Almost ALL of them are worth at least a few good chuckles.This brilliant watch is the ""smart"" version of teenage comedy.  Like Looney Tunes, this show aims at the ""adults"" and as put many times in other reviews is brilliant.  Every viewing uncovers still another intricate detail that keeps me laughing hysterically, despite what most my family cannot understand (my brother-in-law ""gets it"").  The Tangerine Dream soundtrack is a great example of said details.Jerry is a normal, dull dude at high school who stumbles into a day full of nightmares.  The most obvious problem (actually the 2nd or 3rd of the day) pulls up to school early but there are so many other issues waiting beyond the immediate few!  They are all based on imaginations/nightmares of all teenagers at some time or another.

Assume this is a look at a somewhat exaggerated incident between a geek and a bully in the 1980s. Assume this is for entertainment and I need not remind you not only did John Hughes not make it, but it wasn't a huge hit when it released. Assume you will get 90 minutes of light high school fun in Hughes style and you will be happy. Although I was long out of high school during the 80s, I loved the movies from that period and have most of them.This may not have gotten the recognition of some of them especially the John Hughes films, but it certainly is worth a look. I am kind of disappointed that I haven't seen that many fun to watch high school movies since. At the very least rent this one. Based on reviews here I bought it because I enjoy Eighties movies. I wasn't disappointed. This is very much like a John Hughes film. The cast doesn't stand out like in ""Breakfast Club"", but they are still quite capable and you won't be sorry you went to the effort to see it. Decent acting, directing, sets, and good music by Tangerine Dream make this well worth a look.A young man is given an assignment by the school paper to interview a new young man at the high school. The only problem is all the rumors make him out to be a murderer. They aren't to far off. When our hero tries to avoid the fight he is challenged to at three o'clock, all avenues of escape are blocked. The writing may not be quite the caliber of John Hughes, but it is still alot of fun. I recommend this to any fan of those better known Eighties movies like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""My Bodyguard"" and ""Hiding Out"".

When Jerry accidentally touches Buddy, he says that they must fight in the parking lot at 3:pm. Jerry will just about do anything to avoid the confrontation.I have just discovered this film recently. It was never very popular, and I don't know why. I am surprised that a few people can't stand this film. After viewing the DVD a few times, I can honestly say that overall this is not a bad film. The directing is superb. I liked the way the director uses time...the passage of time...and shows its relationship and importance to the story. I also liked the camera blocking, and angles. My favorite shot is of the bully walking out of the school just before the fight: The camera zooms in and tilts up at a low level. A technique taught in film school to show a subject as &#34;larger-than-life&#34;, or menacing over something. The acting was also excellent. Richard Tyson is great as the bully. His deep voice is well suited for this role, and is especially noted if you have a sub-woofer. Yeah, I wouldn't want to fight him, either... Although the story is &#34;typical&#34;, I like the plot-line. Throughout the whole story, the plot slowly builds to an amazing climax, then drops suddenly, and levels off. Its a perfect plot-line. Although, some parts of the story are &#34;far-fetched&#34;. Such as, Jerry pretending to fall in love with his English teacher. One thing to remember, though, this is fiction. Sometimes in fiction, things happen that are unlikely in real life. That's why its called &#34;fiction&#34;. Other than the bland &#34;typical&#34; story, I could not find anything wrong with this film. I have yet to even find so much as a continuity error. In conclusion, if you are looking for &#34;content&#34; you will be disappointed with this film. However, if you are looking for a well-directed film with good use of camera blocking and angles, and actor positioning, you will find this to be a very enjoyable film.

It appears that NOTHING can stop the fight the two are supposed to have promptly at 3pm after that day of school lets out. I haven't seen many movies where the entire plot takes place within a six hour time span. Most memorable segment of this flick is the last twenty minutes. The two duke it out and if you haven't seen this movie before, I certainly won't ruin it for you here. Very climactic ending is all I'll say.

When the somewhat geeky, but still cool star of the movie lights up a cigarette in class and almost takes the teacher down to the floor for some lovin, you know this one is going to be different.So everything is just fine and dandy for Jerry Mitchell.  He is doing good in school and has a nice girlfriend, but he accidentally gets scheduled to fight the new kid, Buddy.  We have all heard those stories about the new kid beating up his teacher at his last school or even killing somebody, but Richard Tyson playing Buddy makes you actually helieve he could have done something that bad.So Jerry is obviously not going to fight him and hires a jock to take him out.

It should have coz this is one good movie.  The simple premise is done wonderfully and keeps you interested from start to finish.  There are great performances all around, especially Richard Tyson as Buddy Revell.  Sure, he looks like he's 30, but he is downright creepy and menacing.  This film may be a comedy, but Tyson plays Revell viciously, as though Tyson thought he was in a drama.  It suffers from the typical 80s view of high school which is unrealistic and overblown(I sure don't remember high school being like it is in these films), but this has a little more sense of reality than other films of the subgenre.  But at the same time it takes on an almost fantasy quality(realistically, Jerry would have been able to escape this situation many times over, but that's not the point.)  I honestly don't know anyone who doesn't like this film.  It keeps you hooked so good that you're dying to find out what happens at three o'clock.  And I don't know about you, but I get a chill every time Jerry walks up to Revell and demands his money back(then preceeds to call him an unpleasant name) and tells him the fight is on.

But somehow along the way among the Breakfast Clubs and the Pretty in Pinks, Three O'Clock High got overlooked.  It's quite rare when I actually meet someone who's heard of this comedy gem.  I had quite a lot of trouble even finding a copy of it on DVD and was going to purchase a copy here on Amazon, but finally found it at a buy/sell/trade store in Hollywood.So anyway, while I am very happy to finally have this movie on DVD in widescreen for the first time, instead of watching it on my VCR on a recorded scratchy tape, I was a little dissapointed that there were no features whatsoever on this disc (movie reccomendations don't count, you can get plenty of those on Amazon).  Further proof that not enough people know or care about this movie.Furthermore, Casey Siemaszko, the star, the heart and soul of this movie, failed to develop as a lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition, (he had a lot of supporting roles in the late 80s such as Young Guns, Stand By Me and Back to the Future) which is a shame because he is too funny in this movie.  The movie has a good cast too, even though the antagonist of the film who looks 15 years too old to be in high school, he's the perfect school bully.  Not to mention this movie has the best school yard fight you'll ever see.Please, check this one out.
