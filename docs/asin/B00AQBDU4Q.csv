You have to know that the movie itself is a bit deeper than I would have first anticipated, but this deeper nature within the film is offset by the amazing acting of both Christopher Walken and Philip Seymour Hoffman. You're drawn into the cell and into the life of Christopher Walken's character and the medical issues that he is dealing with that is leading to his retirement. Yet, the movie so much more than just the drama of the health issues surrounding Walken's character. The movie itself explores so much about human relationships and group dynamics and a it is through these relationships that you truly get to understand the importance of the Quartet itself within the film. overall this is a movie that I would encourage all to watch as it is full of amazing acting performances as well as a plot and underlying message that should be shared with all.*I received a copy of this Blu-Ray in return for an honest review, but this did not impact the words that I shared with all of you above*",5,An Amazing Film!,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1175,"['never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'heard', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'directed', 'film', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'know', 'movie', 'bit', 'deeper', 'would', 'have', 'first', 'anticipated', 'deeper', 'nature', 'film', 'offset', 'amazing', 'acting', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'cell', 'life', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'character', 'medical', 'issues', 'dealing', 'leading', 'retirement', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'drama', 'health', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'Walken', 'character', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'human', 'relationships', 'group', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'truly', 'get', 'understand', 'importance', 'Quartet', 'film', 'overall', 'movie', 'would', 'encourage', 'watch', 'full', 'amazing', 'acting', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'underlying', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'shared', '*I', 'received', 'copy', 'Blu-Ray', 'return', 'honest', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'impact', 'words', 'shared', 'above*']",A Late Quartet

He tells the other members of the group his intentions to retire and he is already grooming a replacement.  This sets up a string of events within the quartet both professional and personal.  There has been a percolating resentment by Robert(Philip Seymour Hoffman), the second violinist, toward Daniel(Mark Ivanir), the first violinist.  Robert feels he and Daniel should alternate chairs as well as take more artistic chances.  Juliette(Catherine Keener), violist and wife of Robert, sits by in angry silence.  Outside the group Robert has a one night stand with a flamenco dancer which Juliette finds out about and throws him out.  Daniel meanwhile is developing a relationship with Alex(Imogen Poots), daughter of Robert and Juliette.  This may all sound a little melodramatic but it's not really.  The inner workings of the quartet mirror those of any group of people who've worked together a long time.  The cast is uniformly excellent but Walken is the glue that holds the film together.  While he's dealing with his illness as the sage elder and de facto leader of the group it is he who has to navigate the quartet through the rough waters.  I won't even pretend that I know much about classical music.  My attraction to the film was the presence of Walken.  I can correlate this film to the dissolution of pop groups like the Beatles who became undone when internal and external distractions caused them to go their separate ways.

I agree with everything positive written by the five-star reviewers before me.This film made me realize anew the tragic loss of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Though all of the actors in this film did a fine job, Hoffman's acting rose to a level beyond the rest.  Omg:  the scene at Sotheby's when he confronts his wife (Catherine Keener's character) as to whether she ever even loved him, or simply married him because he had gotten her pregnant?  You could SEE the raw and naked vulnerability exuding from his face -- SO moving, SO realistic.  RIP, Philip. Your talent will always be missed.There are so many details in this film which I loved, including when Hoffman's deflated character comments to the man who just outbid him at a Sotheby's auction, ""Congratulations:  you just purchased a magnificent violin for $25,000 AND kept it from being owned by a real musician.""  (Or something like that)  That's exactly the type of politely-delivered cutting remark I myself might have made.Several reviewers have warned that you should stay away from this movie if you do not like classical music.  I do not agree with that advice:  appreciation for classical music sometimes takes awhile to cultivate but is SO worth the effort.  Not only does listening to the complex musicality of classical music build neural network connections in the brain (a good thing) but enjoyment of the music increases with repeated exposure.  The more you listen, over time, the more you enjoy it, understand it, and are able to be deeply affected by it.  And it has zero calories!

There's also a good bit about art-in-general, the competition, pretensions, power struggles, and most importantly, the basic purposes of music, painting, and writing. Juliette and Peter's visit to the art museum is perhaps the most memorable part of this film.Plenty of interesting stuff happens here, with several tight interrelated threads. Still, those wanting fast action, wide scope, and/or big, big dramatic conflict may find A LATE QUARTET a trifle dull.Even though it's a film about a string quartet, the mood would probably be enhanced by more silence in the background.

Walken's character, the cellist, starts out with a monologue about the quartet op. 131,  one of the last things Beethoven ever wrote.  It is a monster of a piece.  In the world of quartets, all of which have 4 movements, this one has 7.  I leave aside why 7 - some mystical, or ancient number perhaps?  The movements range from delight, youth, rage, pity, extreme tenderness, a dance, to a look at mortality.  One reviewer of quartet op 131 said it is like Dante's Divine Comedy;  it has everything.  A problem is that its markings demand must be played without interruption between movements, like life itself.  Walken's character notes that these markings make it impossible to play.  As time goes on, with strenuous bowing and plucking, the instruments begin to get out of tune each with itself, then with each other.  Life is much like this.  The quartet is a metaphor for life itself,  ""Late Quartet"" mirrors for us, through incredible music the stages of our own lives as they pass one to the other, bow strings fraying, out of tune episodes overlapping.  The director maintains this wonderfully sensitive metaphor throughout the film.The ensemble of actors is remarkable, as is that of the musicians playing the parts.  I wonder if the ensemble can represent our own internal lives, set musically.  Each of us has a highly fastidious, technically brilliant first violin inside us, as well as a second violin craving more spotlight, a patient, soulful, supportive viola and a visionary cello at the core, who is losing grip on his/her art.  Some will find this suggestion to be too much of a stretch for the film, but I strongly doubt the metaphor is missing from Beethoven's score.  ""Played without break"", what an impossible direction, but life itself goes forward this way, with all our parts, our pasts, our joys, our sorrows, our aging grating at each other.The performances of the actors are a delight, the music even more so.If you wish a performance of the quartet, see the Cypress String quartet's 2012 offering.""http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-The-Late-String-Quartets/product-reviews/B00793ILTI/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1""Sorry, I cannot make an active link.I cannot recommend this film and its music highly enough.If you don't like classical, go for Justin Bieber and his baggy pants and be happy, you're missing something spectacular.",5,"Things fall apart, the center cannot hold.

1614984,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AQBDU4Q,Grady Harp,"[16, 17]","The moments when and idea for a story, the intelligence of a script to tell it, the sensitivity of the director to make it work, and the cast of extraordinary actors to make it visual come all too infrequently these days in the films that cross our theater screens. A LATE QUARTET is such a complete success on so many levels that it should be considered a standard for filmmaking excellence. It is cerebral, yes, it is best appreciated by people who are involved in some way with classical music even if that be solely as an audience, but the dynamics of this little `community' of people drawn together by a lasting contract to rehearse and perform for the better part of their time and the effect of physical proximity and the risks of intellectual/artistic distances have rarely been so exquisitely painted.The honored Fugue Quartet has been living and performing together for 25 years: first violin Daniel Lerner (Ukrainian American actor Mark Ivanir), second violin Robert Gelbart (Philip Seymour Hoffman), cellist Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken), and violist Juliette Gelbart (Catherine Keener) make such perfect music together that we would never guess their lives are askew. Peter is diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease and understands that his performing days are now severely limited; the Gelbart's marriage is at risk because of the tatters of time and the dealing with daughter Alexandra (Imogen Poots) who reacts to her history of being an alone child by entering into a physical affair with obsessive Daniel and Robert's ill-advised one night stand with the young beautiful Pilar (Liraz Charhi); Robert's surfacing jealousy of wanting to be first violin: the struggle with whether the quartet should disband due to Peter's illness or continue with a new cellist. All of this complex interplay of human relationships is underlined by the quartet's rehearing of Beethoven's String Quartet No. 14, opus 131 - a long quartet of seven movements played without interval. It is a sensitively drawn allegory that takes us all the way to the end of the film.In addition to the bravura acting of the four lead actors there are side stories that are enormously touching: the affair between Alexandra and Daniel, the conflict between Alexandra and her absentee mother (a brilliant scene), the schism between Robert and Juliette as the foundation of their marriage begins to crumble, and the extraordinarily sensitive moment when Peter longs for his deceased wife Miriam - first while listening to a recording of Miriam singing Marietta's Lied from Korngold's opera `Die Tote Stadt' and then as the image of Miriam (Anne Sofie von Otter) is seen and heard in is mind.Each of the actors in this masterfully crafted film is astonishingly fine. If there were an Oscar for Ensemble this would have won hands down, but the performances by Christopher Walken (the finest of his career) and Philip Seymour Hoffman are exemplary and the characters Catherine Keener, Mark Ivanir and Imogen Poots create are utterly unforgettable. The highest recommendation for this work - it is a film every sensitive person should see.Grady Harp, March 13",5,Harmonies and Dissonances: The Essence of a String Quartet,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,3141,"['moments', 'when', 'idea', 'story', 'intelligence', 'script', 'tell', 'sensitivity', 'director', 'make', 'work', 'cast', 'extraordinary', 'actors', 'make', 'visual', 'come', 'too', 'infrequently', 'days', 'films', 'cross', 'theater', 'screens', 'LATE', 'QUARTET', 'such', 'complete', 'success', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'standard', 'filmmaking', 'excellence', 'cerebral', 'yes', 'best', 'appreciated', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'way', 'classical', 'music', 'even', 'be', 'solely', 'audience', 'dynamics', 'little', 'community', 'people', 'drawn', 'together', 'lasting', 'contract', 'rehearse', 'perform', 'better', 'part', 'time', 'effect', 'physical', 'proximity', 'risks', 'intellectual/artistic', 'distances', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'painted.The', 'honored', 'Fugue', 'Quartet', 'been', 'living', 'performing', 'together', '25', 'years', 'first', 'Daniel', 'Lerner', 'Ukrainian', 'American', 'actor', 'Mark', 'Ivanir', 'second', 'violin', 'Robert', 'Gelbart', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'cellist', 'Peter', 'Mitchell', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'violist', 'Juliette', 'Gelbart', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'make', 'such', 'perfect', 'music', 'together', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'lives', 'are', 'askew', 'Peter', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'Parkinson', 'Disease', 'performing', 'days', 'are', 'now', 'severely', 'limited', 'Gelbart', 'marriage', 'risk', 'tatters', 'time', 'dealing', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'who', 'history', 'being', 'alone', 'child', 'entering', 'physical', 'affair', 'obsessive', 'Daniel', 'Robert', 'ill-advised', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Pilar', 'Liraz', 'Charhi', 'Robert', 'surfacing', 'jealousy', 'wanting', 'be', 'first', 'violin', 'struggle', 'quartet', 'should', 'disband', 'due', 'Peter', 'illness', 'continue', 'new', 'cellist', 'complex', 'interplay', 'human', 'relationships', 'underlined', 'quartet', 'rehearing', 'Beethoven', 'String', 'Quartet', 'No', '14', 'opus', '131', 'long', 'quartet', 'seven', 'movements', 'played', 'interval', 'sensitively', 'drawn', 'allegory', 'way', 'end', 'film.In', 'addition', 'bravura', 'acting', 'four', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'side', 'stories', 'are', 'enormously', 'touching', 'affair', 'Alexandra', 'Daniel', 'conflict', 'Alexandra', 'absentee', 'mother', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'schism', 'Robert', 'Juliette', 'foundation', 'marriage', 'crumble', 'extraordinarily', 'sensitive', 'moment', 'when', 'Peter', 'longs', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Miriam', 'first', 'listening', 'recording', 'Miriam', 'singing', 'Marietta', 'Lied', 'Korngold', 'opera', 'Die', 'Tote', 'Stadt', 'then', 'image', 'Miriam', 'Anne', 'Sofie', 'von', 'Otter', 'seen', 'heard', 'mind.Each', 'actors', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'film', 'astonishingly', 'fine', 'were', 'Oscar', 'Ensemble', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'hands', 'down', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'finest', 'career', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'exemplary', 'characters', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Mark', 'Ivanir', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'create', 'are', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'work', 'film', 'sensitive', 'person', 'should', 'see.Grady', 'Harp', 'March', '13']",A Late Quartet

His illness and impending departure from the quartet he formed a quarter of a century ago brings up an emotional outpouring among the other 3 members, who now have to face the uncertainty of change. The back-story of each of the individuals and their evolution together is shown through various dialogues and viewing of tapes from interviews of the quartet.Although the premise seems like it would result in a boring movie, the relationship drama is riveting and so well-acted that you can't help but feel empathy for each of the characters. The settings in New York City in winter are quite beautiful. The music is, of course, first rate; and the actors really studied their roles in order to act convincingly with their instruments.

It's one of the finest movies about being a musician I've ever seen, and features some absolutely splendid acting. Walken turns in a career highlight, ditto Hoffman, who just seems to get better and better. But the real surprise for me here was Ivanir, who smolders very believably, and in the only extra on the dvd, an 8 minute doc but a good one, he says he got the role three days before shooting as the original actor dropped out. It's a great turn in any case, but with zero prep it's amazing.Keener and Hoffman are married yet again as in Synecdoche, and they fit so well yet not quite properly that they are all too real. Writer director producer Silberman gives the whole cast some nice chewy lines and scenes, and while it often gets heavily dramatic, it rarely felt melodramatic to me. Anybody who's played music for a living with other musicians knows that it's a marriage in many ways, and rarely have I seen that shown more crisply and honestly on screen than here. The plot does heap on the conflict, but like Beethoven's 131, the chief conceit of the film, the drama is there to make us feel many emotions, and it works.I winced upon seeing a box office of only 1.6 million, but I'll bet A Late Quartet slowly gains cult status, and will one day be seen as a true miniature masterpiece. It's all about relationships, and the lack of pointless violence and product placement and other Hollywood bs is a real pleasure and relief. This is a movie by and for intelligent music lovers, and there are plenty of those out here in the real world. Silberman clearly put his love into this fine work, and it shows.It's also a very touching look at Parkinson's disease, and aging, and letting go. Walken is absolutely rock solid in those scenes, and throughout the film, and you know that Hoffman made this to enjoy working with Chris; their scenes together are brilliant. The final concert is a triumph not only because of the acting and gorgeous performance of the 131 by the Brentano SQ, but because you can tell each actor has gained more comfort playing their instrument, which at the start is clearly not the case. It always kind of hurts as a player to watch actors have no real touch or feel for a fretboard or keyboard, but seeing them all feeling it together at the end really closes the loop here. It feels right, and ennobling, which is what music is there for, and art in general.I had an unexpectedly moving time watching and listening to A Late Quartet, and if you like any of these actors or have ever been moved by pure acoustic music, you might just find this to be a wonderful experience.",5,A real treat for lovers of acting and/or music,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2654,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'what', 'shame', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'being', 'musician', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'acting', 'Walken', 'career', 'highlight', 'ditto', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'was', 'Ivanir', 'who', 'very', 'believably', 'only', 'extra', 'dvd', '8', 'minute', 'doc', 'good', 'one', 'got', 'role', 'three', 'days', 'before', 'shooting', 'original', 'actor', 'dropped', 'out', 'great', 'turn', 'case', 'zero', 'prep', 'amazing.Keener', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'married', 'yet', 'again', 'Synecdoche', 'fit', 'so', 'well', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'properly', 'are', 'too', 'real', 'Writer', 'director', 'producer', 'Silberman', 'whole', 'cast', 'nice', 'chewy', 'lines', 'scenes', 'often', 'heavily', 'dramatic', 'rarely', 'felt', 'melodramatic', 'Anybody', 'who', 'played', 'music', 'living', 'other', 'musicians', 'marriage', 'many', 'ways', 'rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'shown', 'more', 'crisply', 'honestly', 'screen', 'here', 'plot', 'heap', 'conflict', 'Beethoven', '131', 'chief', 'conceit', 'film', 'drama', 'there', 'make', 'feel', 'many', 'emotions', 'works.I', 'winced', 'seeing', 'box', 'office', 'only', '1.6', 'million', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'A', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'slowly', 'gains', 'cult', 'status', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'seen', 'true', 'miniature', 'masterpiece', 'relationships', 'lack', 'pointless', 'violence', 'product', 'placement', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'bs', 'real', 'pleasure', 'relief', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'music', 'lovers', 'are', 'plenty', 'here', 'real', 'world', 'Silberman', 'clearly', 'put', 'love', 'fine', 'work', 'shows.It', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'look', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'aging', 'letting', 'go', 'Walken', 'absolutely', 'rock', 'solid', 'scenes', 'film', 'know', 'Hoffman', 'made', 'enjoy', 'working', 'Chris', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'brilliant', 'final', 'concert', 'triumph', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'gorgeous', 'performance', '131', 'Brentano', 'SQ', 'can', 'tell', 'actor', 'gained', 'more', 'comfort', 'playing', 'instrument', 'start', 'clearly', 'not', 'case', 'always', 'kind', 'hurts', 'player', 'watch', 'actors', 'have', 'real', 'touch', 'feel', 'fretboard', 'keyboard', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'together', 'end', 'really', 'loop', 'here', 'right', 'ennobling', 'what', 'music', 'there', 'art', 'general.I', 'had', 'unexpectedly', 'moving', 'time', 'watching', 'listening', 'A', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'like', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'moved', 'pure', 'acoustic', 'music', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'be', 'wonderful', 'experience']",A Late Quartet

In terms of the personal story, I almost wish the plot had focused on the trio of Robert [Hoffman ] , Jules [ Keener] and Peter [ Walken ]. The dynamic between them was fascinating and the performances beautifully nuanced.  Additionally, it would have made for a tighter plot.Though young musician Alex and older, perfectionistic first violin Daniel are competently played, their story is cliched - older man becomes liberated by way of relationship with a young free spirit, and the intrusion of their affair has a distracting effect.However, watching the interaction between Keener's Jules and Walken's Peter is fascinating. He is the spiritual leader of the group, her surrogate father and  her rock.  He is the one she interacts with physically, feels for, weeps over and is most attached to. In the end her regard is so great, she volunteers to care for him once he becomes immobilized by Parkinson's. While she is invariably kind and polite to the others, he is her greatest love. Strangely her husband, Robert  [ Hoffman ], is more envious of Daniel and hurt by his own position as second violin and the fact that she endorses it than he is of her love for Peter. Peter, a most urbane and intelligent man, loved, still loves and remains faithful to his own recently deceased wife. He is whole, though ill--but the dynamic is tragic for Jules--and even more so for the unloved Robert.Though the end comes too quickly, is too pat, and the resolution of conflict is left to the viewers imagination, I still enjoyed this movie and wish there were more like it,  focusing on the lives of those who bring us the pleasure of experiencing their art.",4,Sacrifice for one's art,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1820,"['beautifully', 'story', 'putting', 'aside', 'one', 'personal', 'drama', 'sake', 'one', 'art', 'continuity', 'artistic', 'tradition', 'case', 'string', 'quartet', 'terms', 'personal', 'story', 'almost', 'wish', 'plot', 'had', 'focused', 'trio', 'Robert', '[', 'Hoffman', ']', 'Jules', '[', 'Keener', ']', 'Peter', '[', 'Walken', ']', 'dynamic', 'was', 'fascinating', 'performances', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'Additionally', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'tighter', 'young', 'musician', 'Alex', 'older', 'perfectionistic', 'first', 'violin', 'Daniel', 'are', 'competently', 'played', 'story', 'cliched', 'older', 'man', 'liberated', 'way', 'relationship', 'young', 'free', 'spirit', 'intrusion', 'affair', 'distracting', 'effect.However', 'watching', 'interaction', 'Keener', 'Jules', 'Walken', 'Peter', 'fascinating', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'group', 'surrogate', 'father', 'rock', 'one', 'physically', 'feels', 'weeps', 'most', 'attached', 'end', 'regard', 'so', 'great', 'care', 'once', 'immobilized', 'Parkinson', 'invariably', 'kind', 'polite', 'others', 'greatest', 'love', 'Strangely', 'husband', 'Robert', '[', 'Hoffman', ']', 'more', 'envious', 'Daniel', 'hurt', 'own', 'position', 'second', 'violin', 'fact', 'love', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'most', 'urbane', 'intelligent', 'man', 'loved', 'still', 'faithful', 'own', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'whole', 'though', 'ill', 'dynamic', 'tragic', 'Jules', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'unloved', 'Robert.Though', 'end', 'too', 'quickly', 'too', 'pat', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'left', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'focusing', 'lives', 'who', 'bring', 'pleasure', 'experiencing', 'art']",A Late Quartet

They are trying to work their way through Beethoven's astonishing Op 131 string quartet. Those not familiar with classical music can still enjoy this movie because its not just about the music they are playing. Its about the player's realtionships and what it takes for four people to come together and have their performances express the intentions of the composer. This not just deals with playing the notes but the player's ability to express the meaning, emotion and nuances that the composer intended. It will never be possible to get in to Beethoven's head, so to speak, but great players can come close. The problem that is happening in this movie is that the behavior of the players threatens to dismantel the quartet. One who is married has a one night stand. Another takes up a doomed relationship with the daugther of two that are in the ensemble. The key player, played by Christopher Walken (a great performance) is dealing with the onset of Parkinsons and has to deal with his situation and what the group needs to do to stay together. The whole thing becomes a real mess but, as viewers will see, the players figure out how to get it together (we think) and go on. At the end I wondered if they could really stay together. But, during a performance when Waklen has to call it quits they all touch the score of Op 131 meaning that great music will sound great only if the players are unified and can work togther. Also, as Walken says in the movie, the players have to respect the music. This is a good movie and classical buffs will get special pleaasure out of it. I gave it four stars out of five as I thought the story is a little soap-opera-ish but that's OK. Its still a good movie. After I saw this movie I grabbed my copy of the op 131 and played it. The movie helped me understand it better. It should be noted that ths film also has special insight into great paintings. There is a scene is a museum that I loved.

It was great and sad to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in one more great roll, and Christopher Walken as the cellist?  Are you kidding me?  He was spectacular!  Totally believable and compelling.

1615013,A226HQJ6IO0CQC,B00AQBDU4Q,M. Okada,"[3, 5]","People who like this movie may want to see the VHS video ""High Fidelity"", which is a documentary about the real Guarneri  quartet, that performed with the same personnel for 40 years and only recently stopped performing .  Or they might want to read the book by that quartet's first violinist Arnold Steinhardt ""Indivisible by Four"", a memoir about the joys and stresses of performing the quartet repertoire and touring all over the world for 40 years.  The fictional Fugue Quartet does an amazing job of faking on their instruments (the real sounds of Beethoven's Op. 131 Quartet are performed by the Brentano Quartet) and Christopher Walken explains how he watched a real cellist during the filming and imitated what that person was doing with his bow and left hand.  The end of the movie features the Fugue Quartet performing the Op. 131 Quartet with excerpts from all seven movements--and the last movement is heard in its entirety during the credits.  Hearing the Op. 131 is eminently satisfying at the end of the movie--in spite of the conflicts and troubles between the 4 members of the group, it's clear that they are compelled to put everything aside to play this great masterpiece, whose episodic movements reflect the life transitions of the four quartet members.  Even Robert (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who wants to start playing first violin, is  willing to resume his subordinate position as second violin in this concert,  which will be Peter's  (Christopher Walken) last.  Robert's desire to play first violin reminds me of a moment in ""High Fidelity"" when violist Michael Tree reveals that he would occasionally like to play violin in the group instead of viola, but he decides not to bring up the subject with the other members to avoid any possible hard feelings.  The actors of ""A Late Quartet"" are excellent and Imogene Poots as the vivacious daughter of the first violinist adds some welcome eye candy.Those viewers who like the music in the movie (almost entirely parts of the Op. 131) should consider listening to the other late quartets of Beethoven.  They are the Op. 127, Op. 130, Op. 131, Op. 132,  Op. 135, and the  alternative final movement for Op. 130.  These quartets cover a huge range of human experience.  Compositionally, Beethoven boldly goes where no composer had gone before.  For the next hundred years, many composers such as Mendelssohn, Mahler, Wagner, and Bartok drew inspiration and borrowed ideas from them.  The first movement of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta was obviously inspired by the first movement of Op. 131.  The Op. 130 features the famous Cavatina and Grosse Fugue.  My favorite is the Op. 127 in E flat major--a big and optimistic work that begins this new and final chapter in Beethoven's compositions.  It is noteworthy that the Op. 127 doesn't contain any hints of the slow 4-note motif that appears in the other quartets and which Is heard several times in ""A Late Quartet"".  Beethoven is often thought of as the composer who is the main bridge between the classical and romantic periods of music--truly someone who changed the world.  ""A Late Quartet"" is a fine introduction to the great achievement of his final quartets.",5,Good Introduction to Beethoven's late quartets,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,3208,"['People', 'who', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'VHS', 'video', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'documentary', 'real', 'Guarneri', 'quartet', 'performed', 'same', 'personnel', '40', 'years', 'only', 'recently', 'stopped', 'performing', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'quartet', 'first', 'violinist', 'Arnold', 'Steinhardt', 'Indivisible', 'Four', 'memoir', 'joys', 'stresses', 'performing', 'quartet', 'repertoire', 'touring', 'world', '40', 'years', 'fictional', 'Fugue', 'Quartet', 'amazing', 'job', 'faking', 'instruments', 'real', 'sounds', 'Beethoven', 'Op', '131', 'Quartet', 'are', 'performed', 'Brentano', 'Quartet', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'how', 'watched', 'real', 'cellist', 'filming', 'imitated', 'what', 'person', 'was', 'doing', 'bow', 'left', 'hand', 'end', 'movie', 'Fugue', 'Quartet', 'performing', 'Op', '131', 'Quartet', 'excerpts', 'seven', 'movements', 'last', 'movement', 'heard', 'entirety', 'credits', 'Hearing', 'Op', '131', 'eminently', 'satisfying', 'end', 'movie', 'spite', 'conflicts', 'troubles', '4', 'members', 'group', 'clear', 'are', 'compelled', 'put', 'everything', 'aside', 'play', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'episodic', 'movements', 'reflect', 'life', 'transitions', 'four', 'quartet', 'members', 'Even', 'Robert', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'start', 'playing', 'first', 'violin', 'willing', 'resume', 'subordinate', 'position', 'second', 'violin', 'concert', 'will', 'be', 'Peter', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'last', 'Robert', 'desire', 'play', 'first', 'violin', 'reminds', 'moment', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'when', 'violist', 'Michael', 'Tree', 'reveals', 'would', 'occasionally', 'like', 'play', 'violin', 'group', 'instead', 'viola', 'not', 'bring', 'up', 'subject', 'other', 'members', 'avoid', 'possible', 'hard', 'feelings', 'actors', 'A', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'are', 'excellent', 'Imogene', 'Poots', 'vivacious', 'daughter', 'first', 'violinist', 'welcome', 'eye', 'candy.Those', 'viewers', 'who', 'music', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'parts', 'Op', '131', 'should', 'consider', 'listening', 'other', 'late', 'quartets', 'Beethoven', 'are', 'Op', '127', 'Op', '130', 'Op', '131', 'Op', '132', 'Op', '135', 'alternative', 'final', 'movement', 'Op', '130', 'quartets', 'cover', 'huge', 'range', 'human', 'experience', 'Compositionally', 'Beethoven', 'boldly', 'where', 'composer', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'next', 'hundred', 'years', 'many', 'composers', 'such', 'Mendelssohn', 'Mahler', 'Wagner', 'Bartok', 'drew', 'inspiration', 'borrowed', 'ideas', 'first', 'movement', 'Bartok', 'Music', 'Strings', 'Percussion', 'Celesta', 'was', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'first', 'movement', 'Op', '131', 'Op', '130', 'famous', 'Cavatina', 'Grosse', 'Fugue', 'favorite', 'Op', '127', 'E', 'flat', 'major', 'big', 'optimistic', 'work', 'new', 'final', 'chapter', 'Beethoven', 'compositions', 'noteworthy', 'Op', '127', ""n't"", 'contain', 'hints', 'slow', '4-note', 'motif', 'other', 'quartets', 'heard', 'several', 'times', 'A', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'Beethoven', 'often', 'thought', 'composer', 'who', 'main', 'bridge', 'classical', 'romantic', 'periods', 'music', 'truly', 'someone', 'who', 'changed', 'world', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'fine', 'introduction', 'great', 'achievement', 'final', 'quartets']",A Late Quartet

Peter, in an amazing performance by Christopher Walken, is the titular leader and cellist.  Still mourning over the loss of his wife, a prominent opera singer, he discovers he has a debilitating illness that will force him to step down from performing.  The group plans a farewell concert timed with their 25th anniversary.All is not well with the rest of the group and Peter's eventual departure motivates Robert (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the second violinist, to insist that he get opportunities as the first violinist.  Currently that chair is, and always has been, Daniel's (Mark Ivanir).  Rounding out the quartet is Juliette (Catherine Keener) who is also married to Robert and is the group's violist.Directed by Yaron Zilberman who also co-wrote with Seth Grossman, the movie could have devolved into a real yawner, but the interaction between characters is wonderful to watch.  Walken in particular struck me as authentic in what would seem to be counterintuitive to his persona.  In a scene early in the picture he talks about his new found malady, which is hanky worthy and unusual.  Not only because it's Walken but because we hardly know this character at this point.The other actors work the script as well.  In a scene with Robert and Juliette, Robert asks Juliette if she ever truly loved him.  The long pause and eventual answer hits Robert in the gut and Hoffman's face signals the pain.  Ivanir, usually a little seen character actor, gets a meaty role as the youngest of the group and the anal perfectionist.  His confrontation with Robert is further complicated by Alexandra (Imogen Poots), the 20-something daughter of Juliette and Robert.  She is smitten with Daniel who is also one of her violin instructors.  This is a wonderfully constructed film, full of great sets and long pieces of Bach.

As the movie begins, we learn that Peter has the beginnings of Parkinson's disease and possibly the end of his musical career. Peter contemplates a replacement so as to assure the contunity of the quartet. Robert at that point voices his long-held frustration of ""just"" being second violinist and would like to share first chair with Daniel, much to Daniel's dismay. Robert and Juliette get into a huge argument about it and when he feels like she doesn't ""have his back"", Robert has a ill-fated affair with a younger woman. Juliette finds out and promply kicks him out of the house. Meanwhile Daniel fall for the charms of Alexandra (daughter of Robert and Juliette). At this point we are about half-way into the movie. Will Peter recover from his illness to bring one last live performance? Will Robert and Juliette reunite? Is Daniel's relationship with Alexandra doomed? Will the Fugue String Quartet survive? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: the acting performances are ACE throughout this movie, none more so than from Philip Seymore Hoffman as the wounded husband and frustrated musician, and in my book better than his much hyped performance in ""The Master"" earlier this year. But check out also Christopher Walken as he stares into his mortality, just superb. If you don't care much for classical music, save yourself the trouble as classical music is front and center throughout this movie (the CD soundtrack of this movie, bringing original music from Angelo Badalamenti, best known for his ""Twin Peaks"" work, and the other assorted classical music is superb too).Bottom line, I enjoyed this movie both for the music and the acting performances, and hence ""A Late Quartet"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Intense classical music and relationship drama,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2053,"['Late', 'Quartet', '2012', 'release', '105', 'min', 'story', 'fictional', 'Fugue', 'String', 'Quartet', 'portrayed', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Robert', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Peter', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Juliette', 'wife', 'Robert', 'Marc', 'Ivanir', 'Daniel', 'movie', 'learn', 'Peter', 'beginnings', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'possibly', 'end', 'musical', 'career', 'Peter', 'replacement', 'so', 'assure', 'contunity', 'quartet', 'Robert', 'point', 'long-held', 'frustration', 'just', 'being', 'second', 'violinist', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'first', 'chair', 'Daniel', 'much', 'Daniel', 'dismay', 'Robert', 'Juliette', 'get', 'huge', 'argument', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'back', 'Robert', 'ill-fated', 'affair', 'younger', 'woman', 'Juliette', 'out', 'promply', 'kicks', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'Daniel', 'fall', 'charms', 'Alexandra', 'daughter', 'Robert', 'Juliette', 'point', 'are', 'half-way', 'movie', 'Will', 'Peter', 'recover', 'illness', 'bring', 'one', 'last', 'live', 'performance', 'Will', 'Robert', 'Juliette', 'reunite', 'Is', 'Daniel', 'relationship', 'Alexandra', 'doomed', 'Will', 'Fugue', 'String', 'Quartet', 'survive', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'ACE', 'movie', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Philip', 'Seymore', 'Hoffman', 'wounded', 'husband', 'frustrated', 'musician', 'book', 'better', 'much', 'hyped', 'performance', 'Master', 'earlier', 'year', 'check', 'out', 'also', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'mortality', 'just', 'superb', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'classical', 'music', 'save', 'trouble', 'classical', 'music', 'front', 'center', 'movie', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'bringing', 'original', 'music', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'best', 'known', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'work', 'other', 'assorted', 'classical', 'music', 'superb', 'too', '.Bottom', 'line', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'music', 'acting', 'performances', 'hence', 'A', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",A Late Quartet

It is a masterful film that displays the humanness of the four participants in the quartet.Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays Robert Gelbart, the second violinist. Christopher Walken, plays the oldest member of the quartet. He plays Peter Mitchell, the cellist. Catherine Keener, plays Juliette Gelbart, and plays the viola. Mark Ivanir, plays Daniel Lerner, who is the first violinist.  They are all members of the Fugue String Quartet, a world-famous ensemble based in Manhattan.  Peter, noticing some weakness in his fingers is diagnosed with Parkinson's, and the world as these renowned musicians know it, falls apart. He suggests they employ another cellist to take his place. This opens up the floodgates of missed opportunities, jealousies and family dynamics. This vibrant group of professionals slowly falls apart.What is most extraordinary, beside the marvelous actors playing these parts, is the extraordinary music they play. Close-ups provide a look at the handwork and the intricate musicianship. What we have here is a family of 25 years who are going through cataclysmic changes in their relationships. Robert and Juliette find their marriage is in trouble, their daughter is in an affair with Daniel, and their life's work is in question. Christopher Walken plays his character, Peter, with exquisite perfection.

This is that movie for me.  Mixing the beauty of classical music and human nature, we are treated to a film that could not be duplicated in its expression and complexity at the same time. ""The Fugue String Quartet"" is fictional in its name, although oh so believable in the way it plays through.  From the story written by director Yaron Zilberman, from his co-written screenplay, comes the character's  psychologies intertwined with music of an extremely moving nature. At times I was held spellbound with the loveliness of ""The Blue Danube"", by Johann Strauss (performance by Mark Steinberg), and also the brilliance of the use of Ludwig van Beethoven.Part of the immensely successful quartet, Second Violinist, Robert Gelbart (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is married to Violist, Juliette (Catherine Keener), and has a grown daughter, Alexandra (Imogen Poots) which together are a family.  Another chair in the string quartet is Violinist, Daniel Lerner (Mark Inavir), whom is scratching severely at Robert's sense of pride of being ""just"" second violin.  Rounding off the foursome is the eldest, Cellist, Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken - in a wonderful performance).  Peter must tell his fellow musicians that he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which would cause a choppy manual dexterity and an inability to play such an instrument any longer.  While he would like to name a replacement for himself, we watch the tightly knit unit unravel.  They have been together for a quarter of a century and in a way you could say the quartet itself has been certainly like a marriage also.  It is within the tightness of them that the four of the personalities have been able to find and hold their placement.  It is now that a dismantling of personas, egos and relationships begin.  Without one, the whole may not ever be a working unit again.Set in the venue of a musical (Angelo Badalamenti) theme in the creative arts, issues come gaining into the scalding bright light, the whole musical pot begins to simmer first, then boil over with what was only topical but is now going so much deeper than just on the surface.  Robert is questioning himself and his marriage while his daughter has begun an affair with Daniel.  Hers is touching, and questionable, within the context of their family as everything goes askew rapidly.  The movie does support some lovely emotional moments concerning Peter and his late wife, Miriam.  I found it touching and necessary during times of crisis such as this is for him.If you are fans of classical music, especially of Beethoven, you will want to see this for their take on his String Quartet number 14 in C# minor, Op. 131 (performed by ""Brentano String Quartet"").  For me this makes the picture all the more worth its interesting venue to hear the greatness of Ludwig van Beethoven playing throughout.  This film is classical genius with a very human story, during which art and ego dual for their placement. This is altogether much more than a simple music movie as we dive into the mindsets of these major players.  These artists are real, well-rounded and also flawed people first.  They feel intensely, and they feel that they do not measure up at times.  Do they get you to thinking?  Yes, they certainly do, and everything is not all about the musical world for these musicians in a character study of sorts.  As relationships derail, will they reunite?  Mainly, though, can Peter make a comeback for just one more time?  In such a heightened sense of falling apart and trying to regain just as quickly, there are many questions you may wish answered as you are witnessing the once tightly bound structure their union once owned.  Interwoven together, the music playing is as lovely as the story is real.  This is one for the emotional side of sentimental people.  ""A late Quartet"" is a movie about relationship issues through the venue of musicality, a heartwarming and conflicting genuine masterwork.",5,"""What Are You Afraid Of ...

The acting was superb and the music was delightful, but for me the most important part of the movie was the message: the sum is greater than the individual parts.The only way a quartet works is by each person bending and flexing and being willing to compromise and acknowledge and hear the needs of the other people involved. If that doesn't happen, it's an imbalanced seesaw that could crash.Although the quartet played classical music, this film made me think about bands like the Beatles and the Stones and even some local Canadian ones I've followed over the years where members have started to hate each other. They go solo for a while, but they're never quite as good by themselves as they are when they're playing as part of the whole.

Last week I watched (and reviewed here on Amazon) the singularly titled ""Quartet"", directed by Dustin Hoffman, about a quartet of retired opera singers who attempt a reunion after many years. This film, ""A Late Quartet"" is about a string quartet that, after 25 years of playing the same music, pretty much the same way that has to deal with change.I liked this film, but certainly not as much as the aforementioned ""Quartet"" - a film that got a number of Oscar nomination - but I did find it entertaining - in a melodramatic way. I see there are 80 reviews posted as I write this (though many are from the theatrical release) so I won't repeat what others said (or try not to) and concentrate on the home video release - in this case the Bluray version.I also recommend that, if you like classical music,  you will enjoy this film but try not to read reviews containing plot spoilers. Yes, you now know this is a melodrama but you'll enjoy it more if you don't know the trigger actions before you watch it.With a superb cast of actors (has Phillip Seymour Hoffman made a bad movie yet?) including Christopher Walken in an out of character role (well, for him) as a low-key cellist, the acting is a step up. The fact that each of the four actors in the quartet, plus British actress Imogen Poots  (who also has to ditch her accent), has to pretend that they can really play during the concert and practice scenes, shows their dedication to a part.I did notice that image moved from dark to light (and back again) but it could be my TV - though other recent BDs haven't acted that way.The BD (and maybe the DVD) has one Bonus feature: The seven-minute featurette - ""Discord and Harmony: Creating A Late Quartet"" which includes interviews with all the major cast members and the film's writer/director, along with scenes from the film. It's interesting but not essential  to enjoyment of the film.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Review of Bluray - Classical Music lovers will want this for the music and stay for the acting,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2052,"['one', 'two', '2012', 'feature', 'films', 'Quartet', 'title', 'Last', 'week', 'watched', 'reviewed', 'here', 'Amazon', 'singularly', 'titled', 'Quartet', 'directed', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'quartet', 'retired', 'opera', 'singers', 'who', 'attempt', 'reunion', 'many', 'years', 'film', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'string', 'quartet', '25', 'years', 'playing', 'same', 'music', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'deal', 'change.I', 'liked', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'aforementioned', 'Quartet', 'film', 'got', 'number', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'did', 'find', 'entertaining', 'melodramatic', 'way', 'see', 'are', '80', 'reviews', 'posted', 'write', 'many', 'are', 'theatrical', 'release', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'said', 'try', 'not', 'concentrate', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'case', 'Bluray', 'version.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'like', 'classical', 'music', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'containing', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'Yes', 'now', 'know', 'melodrama', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'trigger', 'actions', 'watch', 'it.With', 'superb', 'cast', 'actors', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'made', 'bad', 'movie', 'yet', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'out', 'character', 'role', 'well', 'low-key', 'cellist', 'acting', 'step', 'up', 'fact', 'four', 'actors', 'quartet', 'British', 'actress', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'who', 'also', 'ditch', 'accent', 'pretend', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'concert', 'practice', 'scenes', 'dedication', 'part.I', 'did', 'notice', 'image', 'moved', 'dark', 'light', 'back', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'TV', 'other', 'recent', 'BDs', 'have', ""n't"", 'acted', 'way.The', 'BD', 'maybe', 'DVD', 'one', 'Bonus', 'feature', 'seven-minute', 'featurette', 'Discord', 'Harmony', 'Creating', 'Late', 'Quartet', 'interviews', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'film', 'writer/director', 'scenes', 'film', 'interesting', 'not', 'essential', 'enjoyment', 'film.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",A Late Quartet

When cellist Peter is diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease, he decides to retire. The shocking news only makes the other members articulate something long pent-up inside their mind. So will they manage to keep the quartet together?I didn't find the film particularly dismal. Viewers would find it fascinating - or painful - to see the selfish tendencies in the film's characters (except Walken's) that lead to ego clashing. The portrayals of them are fascinating because of the actors' fine performances. They are also painful because, well, these characters are so horrible.But in what way? Here is where the film disappoints, at least for me. The film relies too much on melodramatic exposition to further the story. One character sleeps with someone. Then another character does the same. I thought there would be something insightful about the life of professional musicians in the film's story. Once again, Christopher Walken provides it, but not enough.So, this is what I think. If you are an avid Christopher Walken fan like me, don't miss the film.

1615039,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AQBDU4Q,Turfseer,"[1, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Of the 31 reviews of 'A Late Quartet' at Metacritic, Yaron Zilberman's first feature chronicling the trials and tribulations of a string quartet, 11 were mixed. Approximately five reviewers gave the film a 50 out of 100 score. Typical of these lukewarm reviews were opinions like Nick McCarthy's of Slant Magazine who found the film to be a ""muted soap opera"" and the New Yorker's David Denby, who found it ""conventional"".On the surface, Zilberman attempts to emulate the films of Ingmar Bergman, who often utilized classical music as an integral part of his narrative and focused on characters who were musicians. Indeed, Zilberman's fictional 'Fugue Quartet' dissects Beethoven's Quartet No. 14, Opus 131 throughout the film. Beethoven's unusual instructions to play the piece without pause figures prominently in the plot (indeed, Christopher Walken who plays Peter Mitchell, the founding member of the quartet, intentionally pauses during the performance to announce that he's retiring and handing over the reins to real-life cellist, Nina Lee, whose Brentano Quartet is responsible for the film's soundtrack).Despite all the attention to Beethoven, there is very little sense in this film that we're truly privy to the behind-the-scenes look at the denizens who inhabit the classical musical world. There is an interesting interlude where we get to observe a Sotheby's auction for a rare violin. But most of the film focuses on the machinations of characters who could be part of any venue. What's more, Zilberman, who sticks to conventional melodrama here, fails to infuse his characters with any true idiosyncrasies. The characters pretty much are defined by the overblown crises that beset them.The inciting incident of the film of course is Peter Mitchell's diagnosis that he has Parkinson's Disease. Walken as Mitchell has little to do except attend classes for Parkinson's patients as well as ending up in the middle of the various arguments between the other members of the quartet.Then there is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Robert Gelbart, who resents playing second fiddle to Mark Ivanir's Daniel Lerner as well as having an ill-advised affair with a fellow Central Park jogger, after wife Juliette (Catherine Keener) refuses to take his side in his conflict with Lerner. Lerner makes his own contribution to le grand soap opera, when he beds Robert's and Juliette's daughter, Alexandra (played by the perky Imogen Poots). There's also a subplot involving Alexandra, who resents her mother's damning advice concerning her affair with Daniel.After Robert and Daniel engage in the expected fisticuffs, somehow the quartet reconciles and are able to see off their mentor, with aplomb. Don't ask me exactly why the reconciliation takes place as it's clear director Zilberman's big blast of emotions between the principals, is enough (in Zilberman's mind) to cover for the lack of an explanation as to why the quartet decides to ultimately carry on.Ivanir as Lerner probably has the most interesting role, the taciturn perfectionist who falls for his uninhibited student. What all the characters could have had more of, is of course, a little humor (where was Woody Allen when you needed him?).Zilberman manages to extract some neat and intense performances from the star-studded cast but without an inspired script, don't expect many fireworks.
