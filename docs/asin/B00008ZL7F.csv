750903,AIMR915K4YCN,B00008ZL7F,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","DESCENDANT is about a woman named Ann Hedgerow (the ever-lovely Katherine Heigl) who happens to be a distant relative of Edgar Allen Poe. She runs into a man named Ethan Poe (yep, another relative) and the two start dating. Too bad for Ann that Ethan is a maniac w/ visions of murder dancing in his head! He also has his constant companion, Edgar himself, to keep him company! Ethan's histrionic ranting is quite annoying. Then there's Ann's brother Keifer, who keeps trying to nail his own sister! Yeccch! There are many references to Poe's work throughout the film, but they do little to make it interesting. The ridiculous plot is obviously strung together as an excuse to use said references. The death scenes are comical, especially the demise of William Katt's psychiatrist character! It's unfortunate that most of the film is so utterly boring, as to nullify any potential of being the next TROLL 2. Heigl did go on to bigger and FAR better things, so at least she can forget this pointless mess!...",1,"Poe, Poe Pitiful Me...",1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,1006,"['DESCENDANT', 'woman', 'named', 'Ann', 'Hedgerow', 'ever-lovely', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'who', 'be', 'distant', 'relative', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'man', 'named', 'Ethan', 'Poe', 'yep', 'relative', 'two', 'start', 'dating', 'Too', 'bad', 'Ann', 'Ethan', 'maniac', 'w/', 'visions', 'murder', 'dancing', 'head', 'also', 'constant', 'companion', 'Edgar', 'keep', 'company', 'Ethan', 'histrionic', 'ranting', 'quite', 'annoying', 'Then', 'Ann', 'brother', 'Keifer', 'who', 'trying', 'nail', 'own', 'sister', 'Yeccch', 'are', 'many', 'references', 'Poe', 'work', 'film', 'do', 'little', 'make', 'interesting', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'obviously', 'strung', 'together', 'excuse', 'use', 'said', 'references', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'comical', 'especially', 'demise', 'William', 'Katt', 'psychiatrist', 'character', 'unfortunate', 'most', 'film', 'so', 'utterly', 'boring', 'nullify', 'potential', 'being', 'next', 'TROLL', '2', 'Heigl', 'did', 'go', 'bigger', 'FAR', 'better', 'things', 'so', 'least', 'can', 'forget', 'pointless', 'mess']",N/A

Later on the girl goes to bed and then her brother tries to rape her. Obviously rape isn't nice and so she does the right thing by kicking him out of her house (brilliant!). A few hours later she invites her cousin to move in with her and that's when he starts to talk and shout to invisible people. This doesn't bother her though, she still wants to have his babies even though he throws mad fits. What broke the camels back was when he locked her in her room... kill people and talk to invisible creatures but don't lock a woman in her room. Lucky ye old piece of paper and a pin worked to get her out. This movie features Jeremy London who starred in The Chronic Masturbator Trilogy and some chick from a TV show I've never watched. This movie is so bad that if Edgar Allan himself saw this film he would have overdosed before the credits rolled.
