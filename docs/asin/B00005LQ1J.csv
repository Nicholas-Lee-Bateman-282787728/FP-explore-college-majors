When i got this DVD i was bitterly dissapointed.  There are movements in this viedo that should not be atempted by anyone with weights. (ie standing on one leg, kicking out and doing a shoulder press all at the same time).  also the flow of the movements was not well coordinated.  It was choppy and the putting of the weights up and down was just too much.

Then, there is a cool down of about 5 minutes, which I usually omit, since I cool down on my own.You will need weights for this workout; anywhere from 3-10lbs, one 'light' pair and one 'heavy'. This workout may not be ideal for people who have balance issues, as you do a lot of exercises supporting yourself on one leg, while the other is working. It can take some getting used to.One exercise entails placing one leg forward and doing 3 standing hamstring curls with the other, then transferring your body weight back and lifting the front leg, knee bent. At the same time, you are holding weights, which are then brought up in a shoulder press and then down to a biceps curl as your front leg lowers back to the floor. It might sound a bit complicated, but the shoulder press/biceps curls actually follow the movement of your leg (knee up, shoulder press-- leg down, biceps curl). You of course later switch and repeat the process on the opposite leg.Another exercise is a squat, wider stanced than normal as you hold a pair of heavy dumbbells criss crossed between your hands. As you squat, you do a biceps curl with the weights, and then raise your arms as you come up from the squat to do a french press for your triceps before lowering your arms and lowering back into the squat.There are also a lot of lunges in this video, both rear and front. During some of these, you hold the lunge while you do various arm exercises with whichever weight is required. You do front shoulder raises (single and double arm) in one series. In another, you do side arm raises which transition to a hammer curl.In another segment, you are on the floor, feet flat on the ground, hands positioned under your shoulders, fingers facing towards your heels as you support your body weight (hips and back are off the floor). You then raise/lower yourself in a triceps dip. Raising your hips higher, you remain in this position while extending one leg straight in front of you, raising it for 3 counts and lowering it for 1. You then switch legs. That series is a bit tough.Most of the exercises you do, you can adjust your level slightly, if need be. (For example, if you don't want to do a jump/hop and would rather merely do a side step.) There is a lady off to Violet's immediate left who does modifications on the exercises which require it.Also in this video you do some standing ab work, as well as ab work while on the floor.It's a good workout and Violet shows you each exercise before you actually execute it. With a little patience, you should get the hang of things in no time, even if you are a little wobbly when it comes to some of the one legged balance type exercises. Just remember to tighten your core and focus on your form and you should be fine.",5,Tough; just wish it were longer,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,2860,"['video', 'led', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'just', 'shy', '29', 'mins', 'Warm', 'up', 'cardio', 'sculpt', 'segments', 'combined', 'Then', 'cool', 'down', '5', 'minutes', 'usually', 'omit', 'cool', 'down', 'own.You', 'will', 'need', 'weights', 'workout', 'anywhere', '3-10lbs', 'one', ""'light"", 'pair', 'one', ""'heavy"", 'workout', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ideal', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'balance', 'issues', 'do', 'lot', 'exercises', 'supporting', 'one', 'leg', 'other', 'working', 'can', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'to.One', 'exercise', 'placing', 'one', 'leg', 'forward', 'doing', '3', 'standing', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'other', 'then', 'transferring', 'body', 'weight', 'back', 'lifting', 'front', 'leg', 'knee', 'bent', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'holding', 'weights', 'are', 'then', 'brought', 'up', 'shoulder', 'press', 'then', 'down', 'biceps', 'curl', 'front', 'leg', 'back', 'floor', 'might', 'sound', 'bit', 'complicated', 'shoulder', 'curls', 'actually', 'follow', 'movement', 'leg', 'knee', 'up', 'shoulder', 'press', 'down', 'biceps', 'curl', 'course', 'later', 'switch', 'repeat', 'process', 'opposite', 'leg.Another', 'exercise', 'squat', 'wider', 'stanced', 'normal', 'hold', 'pair', 'heavy', 'dumbbells', 'criss', 'crossed', 'hands', 'squat', 'do', 'biceps', 'curl', 'weights', 'then', 'raise', 'arms', 'come', 'up', 'squat', 'do', 'french', 'press', 'triceps', 'lowering', 'arms', 'lowering', 'back', 'squat.There', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'lunges', 'video', 'rear', 'front', 'hold', 'lunge', 'do', 'various', 'arm', 'exercises', 'whichever', 'weight', 'required', 'do', 'front', 'shoulder', 'raises', 'single', 'double', 'arm', 'one', 'series', 'do', 'side', 'arm', 'raises', 'transition', 'hammer', 'curl.In', 'segment', 'are', 'floor', 'feet', 'flat', 'ground', 'hands', 'positioned', 'shoulders', 'fingers', 'facing', 'heels', 'support', 'body', 'weight', 'hips', 'back', 'are', 'floor', 'then', 'raise/lower', 'triceps', 'dip', 'Raising', 'hips', 'higher', 'remain', 'position', 'extending', 'one', 'leg', 'straight', 'front', 'raising', '3', 'counts', 'lowering', '1', 'then', 'switch', 'legs', 'series', 'bit', 'tough.Most', 'exercises', 'do', 'can', 'adjust', 'level', 'slightly', 'need', 'be', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'jump/hop', 'would', 'rather', 'merely', 'do', 'side', 'step', 'lady', 'Violet', 'immediate', 'left', 'who', 'modifications', 'exercises', 'require', 'it.Also', 'video', 'do', 'standing', 'ab', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'ab', 'work', 'floor.It', 'good', 'workout', 'Violet', 'shows', 'exercise', 'actually', 'execute', 'little', 'patience', 'should', 'get', 'hang', 'things', 'time', 'even', 'are', 'little', 'wobbly', 'when', 'one', 'legged', 'balance', 'type', 'Just', 'remember', 'tighten', 'core', 'focus', 'form', 'should', 'be', 'fine']",Crunch - Cardio Sculpt VHS
