Lets just say he has to do a lot to get the treasure! I was at first hesitant to watch this movie. I finally decided to give it a try--and it was GREAT! There's tons of action and car chasing that I like to see in movies. The plot is great and the actors are awesome! I really enjoyed watching this movie. I even watched the second one and still liked the first one a little better! That's how good it is. It's also one of the movies where there's hardly any language to it, and hardly any violence.

626886,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JN5E,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 4]","""National Treasure"" is a suspenseful and entertaining movie journey.  We follow the treasure hunt crusade of an adventurer, Gates (Nicolas Cage) who goes from the arctic to the nation's capital and its surrounding places.  He receives clues until he and his acquired sidekick (Diane Krieger) capture the ""Declaration of Independence"" from its vault and head place to place, obtaining further clues (like a child's treasure hunt) and seek buried treasure.The plot is preposterous, and the journey is worth more than the destination, but ""National Treasure"" has been unfairly maligned.  The characters are likable, the adventure often is tense, and the humor is substantial enough to enjoy.  Yes, the movie's low-point is when they are squeezing lemon juice on one of our nation's most revered documents, but it provides a mixed blessing:  We should all be rolling our eyes, but we find ourselves biting our nails at the same time.  The picture would be a disaster if they didn't provide suspense and the ability to suspend the viewer's disbelief to a reasonable degree.  ""National Treasure"" may be fool's gold, but it is breezy and fun-filled enough to be given a look at least once.

I spent a lot of time though the movie trying to figure out what the next move would be.  Sometimes I got the references before but mostly after.I like the way the movie changed from having a couple of nuts going after a legend to a cat and mouse game of adversaries.  I don't know how much is true about this film but the National Archives had more security than I had thought.  The film also gives you a feeling of National Pride when the good guy steal something so that the bad guys can't get it because he want to protect it.The romantic situations are pretty pridictable but that doesn't really matter. I enjoyed the film and it is a very good action adventure.The best part about this being on DVD is finding out all the coding techiques in the extras and the additional features you get if you solve the puzzles.

626889,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,B00005JN5E,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[2, 3]","How refreshing to see a good action yarn on DVD.  While the story had a few holes, this film was entertaining none the less.  Nicholas Cage 4th or is that 5th generation treasure hunter, Ben Gates, holds the viewer's attention at all times.  This tale revolves around hidden Templar, Freemason, Founding Father loot hidden away somewhere in the good ol' US of A.  The characters are on a quest to decipher clues in our money, on old ships, in the National Archives to determine just where all this loot, if it does exist, was hidden.  The supporting cast doe an excellent job, Justin Bartha, as Gates sidekick Riley Poole is, unlike most adventure sidekicks, actually quite clever.  Diane Kruger as the government bureaucrat caught up in this mystery, Abigail Chase, is captivating.  The film also features Sean Bean as the bad guy, a role he seems to be placed in far too often in my opinion, Jon Voight as Gate's father, Christopher Plummer as the grandfather, and Harvey Keitel as the FBI agent.  This film has lots of action, good on location back drops and great visuals.  I must say, I like it better than all the Indiana Jones tales put together.  A great family film, all can enjoy.  You see, Hollywood can make a great movie without gratuitous vulgar language and sex scenes.

626892,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JN5E,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 36]","National Treasure was a failure as a film.  While the monetary figures will not support this comment, I will say that upon viewing this film, it is nothing but accurate.  From the clich&eacute;d story, to the cheap acting, to even the simplistic ""clues"" National Treasure proved that if you have a big named actor in the lead, some pre-high school history, and a powerhouse producer (and the big Pirates of the Caribbean passion) that you could literally sell a screen door on a submarine.  What was the excitement behind this film?  Why is there still a waiting list at my video store for this title?  There was nothing of value from the beginning to end of this film that would ever cause the hysteria that I have seen so far.  Nicolas Cage proves to the world that he is the male version of Marisa Tomei (questioning his choices after his deserved Oscar win), and that he has the ability to run, jump, and reason with the greatest of speed.  Acting wasn't necessarily needed, just the ability to look smarter than one truly is.With my questions posed as to how the success of this film became a part of American cinema, I thought back to this film.  The acting was atrocious.  Nic Cage looked and acted just like a mannequin throughout this entire film.  There was no range of emotion or excitement in anyway.  His romantic involvement with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) was like watching two complete strangers try to build a passionate relationship in ten minutes.  It was awkward, cheesy, and embarrassing for all those involved.  Even the acting from the ""comic relief"" of the film, Cage's sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) seemed forced.  His jokes didn't make me laugh once, but instead made me feel uneasy and cheated out of some hard earned cash plopped down for this film.  To have a successful ""action-adventure"" film, you must have it firmly stapled with some decent acting.  If big stars are only going to water down your film (as in the case of National Treasure), then you must find smaller stars and build upon the story.  These are simple rules, which nobody in this production followed.With no acting in place, I was forced to watch the story unfold before my eyes.  Actually, the story felt like a crumpled piece of paper thrown at me.  There was no direction, no points for me to follow, but instead haphazard movement by our actors and director to keep the flow of the film in motion instead of becoming stale.  Sadly, they were unable to do this.  From the opening ""clue"" to the final one, there was little to no explanation as to why nobody else had found this treasure, or how local historians had never found the hidden artifacts scattered around hugely populated areas.  I would understand if we were searching cornfields, but we were in metropolises and nobody discovered these clues until today.  It was just rather unbelievable to me.  I felt like this story was yelling at me.  Violently forcing me to follow each clue without explanation, but out of sheer hope that something bigger would happen.  I work better when there is some moment of ""why"" thrown into the mix.  A moment that allows the viewers to think for themselves instead of being treated like children.  After viewing this film, that was how I felt.  I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions, but instead the power of Bruckheimer was forcing me to think in one way, and one way only.  It hurt this film and upset me until the final credits arrived.Finally, I would like to say (because I am sure that most are upset with my dislike of this film) that another point that hurt this film was the lack of action.  This movie is labeled as the next Indiana Jones, but if you grew up with the stories of Lucas and Spielberg, you will remember that they were action based.  There were moments of realization, but there was much more action involved.  I think more action incorporated into the National Treasure story would have helped it survive a bit longer than what it did.  I wanted to see some traps set forth by our founding fathers, some ancient guards, or anything that would have lifted the lifeless plot that surrounded this film.  My mother said that it just needed better bad guys, and I couldn't agree more.  There wasn't that fire in Bean's eyes that you were accustomed to seeing in the Indy films.  Nobody was tied up, nobody had a whip, and nobody was trying.  Bruckheimer, you literally need to stop.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this Hollywood ""hit"".  While most will argue that they thought it was the most impressive film they have seen in a long time (words that I have heard time and time again), I just thought that it never went to the next level.  The clich&eacute; acting hurt this film dearly, while the story just never reached up and grabbed me.  I never felt like Turtletaub (ummmmmm....Turtletaub) quite knew what he was getting himself into.  He needed a stronger balance between action and adventure, and needed to allow us to make our own decisions instead of forcing his thoughts into our face.  This film was a complete disrespect to our history, and I denounce it forever!Grade: * out of *****",1,Are we there yet? I'm hungry.

Warriors are losing their shirts to the U.S.C. Trojans.Let me start by saying ""National Treasure"" utterly did not live up to the hype that was lavished upon it in the pre-release media blitz. Simply put, it was a blatant all-out campaign to sell the public on the legitimacy of Freemasonry that has always had a shadowy past.Where did I watch this you ask? I happened to be 38,000feet in the air heading to Las Vegas looking forward to a great vacation. I did not expect to watch a poor theatrical performance where even the actors put aside their natural talents to peddle incessantly the dribble of masonry. So much for getting good entertainment value for the money!?What was there to like? Well, the Indiana Jones' action sequences were good plus the near misses to life and limb were interesting. I do like Nicholas Cage as an bonafide actor but even his talent could'nt save a film that left you feeling empty at the end with more questions than answers.Historically, there appears to be evidence of revisionist creative liberties and licenses taken on a monumental scale. The All-Seeing Eye on the $1 dollar bill did'nt appear there until Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it there during his term of office as the president of the United States of America. It looks like these people came out of the closet and have come into the light of day only recently having prepared the American public for such a day. Unfortunately, I like my entertainment straight forward without alot of contrived nonsense and intentional programming meant to sway my objective sense of things.Would I recommend this movie to anybody. Well, it depends what you want out of it.

This is GREAT fun, and a good family action/adventure romp. Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, one of a long family line of treasure hunters, eschewed by his peers, and the scientific community in general, for having chased a ""mythical"" treasure most of his life. After finding a very big clue to his quest in the Arctic, he is double crossed by his financial partner (Sean Bean) and left in the snow while the former returns to Washington, to plan some nefarious activites. In case you haven't seen any of the trailers, the premise is that there is a hidden map on the rear of the declaration of independence which Cage must protect by stealing it himself. The implausibly young and attractive archive director Dr Chase (Diane Kruger)gets caught up in the action, as does Cages father played by Jon Voight, and his quirky computer whizz sidekick essential to attract the 14-21 demographic. The key word here is Improbable (or any other synonym you may choose) as Cage is able to decipher each more increasingly obscure and difficult clue, by simple brainstorming, and plenty of AHA! moments after pause for thought lead us on to the next level. If you can forgive this aspect of the story you will love this movie, there is a lot of action, escapes, a little romance, and Cage et al are believable for the most part.

The plot stretches reality to the breaking point. Cage has to steal the Declaration to save it? Give me a break. If a thief could steal the Declaration, it would have already been stolen. The Declaration, itself, can't be worth that much less than the treasure. And the developing love between Cage and that German immigrant is just as surreal as the idea of there being a secret map on the back of the Declaration.And if you're going to excuse reality, can't you come up with a more interesting ending of where the treasure is? After, spending the bulk of the movie in historically important places like Washington DC and Philadelphia, where the treasure ultimately ended up was lame (I won't tell you in case you haven't seen it). I would have at least been amused if the treasure ended up being buried at Washington's home at Mount Vernon or Jefferson's Monticello.

The Masons did exist, and they were a rather secretive society; it's not odd to find that many of our most famous presidents were part of the Masons.Anyhow, onto the film itself.  I personally don't really like or dislike Cage.  I find hims suitable for films where his directness is useful.  National Treasure is such a movie.Without giving too much of the plot away, the film starts by him finding the ""Charlotte."" A pivotal clue that has been passed down through is family line, who have been searching for it generation, after generation- so much so, that the Gates (the main character's last name) name has a sullied reputation for being ""conspiracy theorists.""Of course, it leads to the plot where the Declaration of Independence is going to be stolen by the scruffy Boromir (from Lord of the Rings fame); to his credit, he makes the character credible, even if I kept thinking, damn Boromir, didn't you learn that trying to steal the ring is wrong?Anyhow, Cage decides that the best way to save the Declaration of Independence is to steal it himself.  I mean, his logic is that a thief will just destroy it once he is done with it, while he will only use it to find the treasure and then return it. A rather weak logic, but hey, what is a guy supposed to do when not even the FBI will hear him out?Needless to say, I think it was rather smart the way the movie approached the clues.  From our awfully curious one dollar bill symbol (I mean, come on, I've always thought that symbol was rather out of place--and smells too much of the Illuminati), to the map being on the you know what.It's plausible that there could be a treasure hidden. Although, the location itself kind of dissappointed.  It seemed too easy to get to, but you know the old saying, the best place to hide things is usually in plain view.The movie delivers in an engaging story, that keeps you occupied as it moves from clue to clue, and chase to chase.  The action is not over the top so that it takes over the movie, but it's there in just enough to keep the adrenaline pumping.  There is even a somewhat small love story, if you can call it that; it's funny though, the movie knows the love story is a bit forced and makes fun of itself when one of the bad guys says ""Now why doesn't that ever happen to me?""

CAST.Whatever your thoughts are on Nicolas Cage, you can't beat a cast that includes:Jon Voight, Sean Bean, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Plummer.(Oh, all right, Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, and Justin Bartha are in it too...)National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets has Helen Mirren and Ed Harris as well.Among all the cast, Sean Bean and his villainous sidekicks deserve special notice for stealing the scenes.Every scene.2. SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.Unfortunately, while National Treasure is a fun and enjoyable ride, it doesn't just NUKE the fridge so much as dump it in the middle of a nuclear holocaust, then bomb it, blast it, napalm it, and open fire on it.In other words, National Treasure is fun, only if you don't use your brain.A good scene to illustrate my point would be the scene where both Cage and Bean try to steal the Declaration of Independence.Bean's crew:Drill, Drill, Hammer. Door 1 open.Hammer, Hammer, Power-tool. Door 2 open.Chain in the fan, Electric Saw, Drill. Crawl through the fan.Explosion, Drill, Hammer. Wall knocked down.Cage's crew:Tappity Tap Tap. Security Systems Down.Tappity Tappity: Camera's off.Tap Tap Tap: Password decoded.Tappity Tappity Tap: Door open.Please tell me it's not that easy to steal America's most precious document......It also doesn't just require you to SUSPEND your disbelief... It requires you to HANG it. Forever. Then cut it down and bury it in a box. Then burn the box. Then burn the ashes.3.

Understandably so, I suppose, if you consider that it has no particular artistic merit to recommend it. On the other hand, if you're like me, veracity, artistry and believability in movies play second fiddle to entertainment value. For real life drama, I'm more inclined to read a newspaper or check the news. I usually watch movies for fun and to be entertained. In that sense, NATIONAL TREASURE fills the bill.Does that mean I think NATIONAL TREASURE is a great movie? No. Read the professional critic at the top of the column. He hits the nail right on the head. It's hokey and contrived; a ""comedy/caper"" of absurd proportions. Nor is there a classic acting performance comparable to the one given by Johnny Dep in PIRATES to recommend it (personally, I thought Geoffrey Rush was also terrific). The acting here is solid, but unspectacular.Still, this movie is fast-paced fun with lots of engaging puzzles, some interesting high tech gadgetry, tunnels, skeletons and, of course, a treasure of ridiculous proportions. It's sort of an adult version of THE GOONIES. And, for those of you who appreciate beautiful women, Diane Kruger is lovely as Dr. Chase.If you're looking for a serious drama, or something artistically redeeming, steer clear of NATIONAL TREASURE.

""National Treasure"" has an adventurous story, fun characters, and dives into our nation's history... and may leave you walking out of the theater wondering if it's at all possible.Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, obsessed with the legend that his grandfather told him of the Founding Fathers leaving behind clues to a great treasure. Clues that are on the Liberty Bell, clues inside a ship buried in snow, and yes, clues on the back of the Declaration of Indenpendence. He has spent his entire life searching, only to be double crossed when he finally finds a good clue aboard a ship that's been buried under snow for years.The movie is filled with moments that'll make you grit your teeth and clutch your chair. Will he make it? Can he escape? Can he do it? With the help of a goofy sidekick and (of course) a beautiful girl, a historian no less, Gates may just find that long lost treasure.

626925,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JN5E,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","You pretty much know what you are getting when you see producer Jerry Bruckheimer's name stamped on a film. Not necessarily so all the time with the great Nicolas Cage. But you put the two of them together in a big action/adventure and you definitley know what you'll be seeing. Having previously paired up for the high octane action flicks like ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"", Cage and Bruckheimer deliver films that are nothing but big buckets of greasy popcorn with a heap of fun on top. That's what this movie delivers. Good, old fashioned fun in the ""Indiana Jones"" variety. Directed by Jon Turteltaub, the movie is a rollicking fun ride through our nation's history, and traveling in, around, and sometimes beneath, historic places of the land. Nic Cage stars as Ben Gates, Benjaim Franklin Gates, a treasure hunter. Thru flashbacks in the beginning with his grandfather(Christopher Plummer)when he was younger, Ben has been on the search of elusive treasure. The Treasure of the Knights of Templar, kept hidden from freemasons then and now. He comes to believe can be found with the help of an invisible map that he believes is on the back of the declaration of independence. The famed document of which he has to steal(before others do). With the help of his sidekick Riley(Justin Bertha), and Abigail Chase(Diane Kruger), Ben and Co. are off on an incredible journey to find the treasure. But all is not well when he and his cohorts have another gang hot on their heels to find the treasure themselves. While the movie may not aiming for incredible, long lasting credibility, it does achieve a very important things for movies of this nature that make it a success. It's fun. It's entertaining. It's funny. It has a fun cast. It looks good and just delivers all the popcorn thrills one would come to expect. Naysayers might complain of how ""out there"" the plot is, but does it matter?. It's a movie. Not real life. It set out to be what it is, and it succeeded. How could anyone not like a fun adventure filled with snow covered ships, daring robberies, hidden tunnels, crypts, skeletons, and tresure?. Cage has always been one of the most dynamic and watchable performers, and he comes to the role of Ben Gates with the right kind of appeal and makes it better than it is. Jon Voight also co-stars as his father, Patrick Gates, an ex-treasure hunter who believes he wasted his life looking for nothing. Sean Bean has made a career out of playing criminals of some kind, and here's another one to add to the list. But he does do it well. Kruger is an appealing and beautiful heroine along for the ride, but it feels like her character is just for another damsel in distress. Bartha is the main comic relief. He has the best lines and the parts that will have the audience laughing the most. And then there is Harvey Keitel, as an FBI agent on the trail of Gates and crew. There seems to be a lot of love for this movie by other reviews here, and it's nice to see that. Nice to see that movies that are incredibly fun, entertaining, and just down right enjoyable, like this one, are seen for what they are. A good time. Not like some critics who cut it down for it's ""ridiculous plot"" and all the mumbo jumbo that comes with it. Again, a lot of them don't see what it's really here for. Filled with a decent enough script that holds the film and clues together good enough, eye catching direction from Turteltaub, and cool fun, National Treasure is a clean and fun thrill ride for everyone.",5,Did Bigfoot Steal It?,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,3492,"['pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'when', 'see', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'name', 'stamped', 'film', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'so', 'time', 'great', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'big', 'action/adventure', 'definitley', 'know', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'Having', 'previously', 'paired', 'up', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'flicks', 'Rock', 'Con', 'Air', 'Cage', 'Bruckheimer', 'deliver', 'films', 'are', 'nothing', 'big', 'buckets', 'greasy', 'popcorn', 'heap', 'fun', 'top', 'what', 'movie', 'delivers', 'Good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fun', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'variety', 'Directed', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'movie', 'rollicking', 'fun', 'ride', 'nation', 'history', 'traveling', 'sometimes', 'beneath', 'historic', 'places', 'land', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Benjaim', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'Thru', 'flashbacks', 'beginning', 'grandfather', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Ben', 'been', 'search', 'elusive', 'treasure', 'Treasure', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'kept', 'hidden', 'freemasons', 'then', 'now', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'help', 'invisible', 'map', 'back', 'declaration', 'independence', 'famed', 'document', 'steal', 'others', 'do', 'help', 'sidekick', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bertha', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Ben', 'Co.', 'are', 'off', 'incredible', 'journey', 'find', 'treasure', 'not', 'well', 'when', 'cohorts', 'have', 'gang', 'hot', 'heels', 'find', 'treasure', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'aiming', 'incredible', 'long', 'lasting', 'credibility', 'achieve', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'movies', 'nature', 'make', 'success', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'fun', 'cast', 'good', 'just', 'delivers', 'popcorn', 'thrills', 'one', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'Naysayers', 'might', 'complain', 'how', 'there', 'plot', 'matter', 'movie', 'Not', 'real', 'life', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'succeeded', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'not', 'fun', 'adventure', 'filled', 'snow', 'covered', 'ships', 'daring', 'robberies', 'hidden', 'tunnels', 'crypts', 'skeletons', 'tresure', 'Cage', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'dynamic', 'watchable', 'performers', 'role', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'right', 'kind', 'appeal', 'better', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'also', 'father', 'Patrick', 'Gates', 'ex-treasure', 'hunter', 'who', 'wasted', 'life', 'looking', 'nothing', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'criminals', 'kind', 'here', 'one', 'add', 'list', 'do', 'well', 'Kruger', 'appealing', 'beautiful', 'heroine', 'ride', 'character', 'just', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Bartha', 'main', 'comic', 'relief', 'best', 'lines', 'parts', 'will', 'have', 'audience', 'laughing', 'most', 'then', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trail', 'Gates', 'crew', 'be', 'lot', 'love', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'nice', 'see', 'Nice', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'are', 'seen', 'what', 'are', 'good', 'time', 'Not', 'critics', 'who', 'cut', 'down', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'Again', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'really', 'here', 'Filled', 'decent', 'enough', 'script', 'film', 'clues', 'together', 'good', 'enough', 'eye', 'catching', 'direction', 'Turteltaub', 'cool', 'fun', 'National', 'Treasure', 'clean', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride', 'everyone']",National Treasure

NATIONAL TREASURE had me rolling my eyes so often that I feared the condition would become permanent.Nicolas Cage plays the subtly-named Benjamin Franklin Gates, a professional treasure-hunter. (You've met one of those before, right? Anyone? Anyone???) He's convinced there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, one that his family has sought for hundreds of years. Evil treasure hunters are after the map, too, so Gates decides he needs to steal the Declaration first and go after the secret map with a hair dryer and lemon juice (because the Founding Fathers apparently decided to design the map during a sleepover before braiding each other's hair).Of course, the only person who believes him about the map is the head of the National Archives, a doctorate-holding historian played by a 28-year-old German model with an accent named Diane Kruger. (Plausibility is not the film's strong point, which you realize long before young Kruger starts to fall for the hair-plugged, crow's feet-laden Cage.)Sean Bean plays the villain, who is really smart until the screenplay requires him to be really stupid. Jon Voight plays Cage's father, which is weird because Voight's actual daughter played Cage's love interest in another Bruckheimer movie.

Split-second decisions and impeccable timing rescue Cage's character from certain death/failure on so many occasions that they would be impossible to list here...but it's done so well, and with so much style and humor, that I found it difficult to not be entertained.Better still, it's a movie that parents can enjoy with their kids. Language throughout is commendably clean, and unlike many so-called ""family"" films, there isn't a single gag involving bodily functions...Dear God, does this mean the world is coming to an end? : )Check reality at the doorstep, pop in the DVD, and settle back for a good time.

It was some mindless fun with action sequences, neat little gadgets, a great villain, a geek/comedian, and a little romance stirred in.The acting pretty much sucked, though. Which really bothered me. I love Nicholas Cage (for the most part). But here he seemed to just be going through the motions, page by screenplay page.And then there's the ending.

Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero, and this film is no ""Indiana Jones"". People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.I can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for. Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous. I also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film. Simply put: it's just OK at best.National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what it does have from ""The Da Vinci Code"". I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense.The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting the ""bad guys"" and experiencing what is suppsoed to be ""non-stop action"" is absurd. I particulary loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it. Oh brother!Reminded me of that episode of the ""Brady Bunch"" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans.

Literally, there are thousand of undiscovered ""priceless"" items in this treasure trove. Yeah right!! Ridiculous!!Even worse, the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are suppsoed to be ""tough"" clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous!!! Oh.. the humanity!The performances by Cage, Voight, and the other actors in ""National Treasure"" are as stiff ,wooden, and flat as they come.

Well, I often say that if the masses love it, then it must be bad. The truth is probably somewhere in between.National Treasure starts off with great potential: Masonic underpinnings to the country, secret codes that reveal mysteries, and a treasure to be found, oh boy! The problems kick in with the hokey dialogue (Harvey Keitel proves that award winners can really be lame in a film and often take anything for money). He actually says something like, ""This is not a good day for ummmm.""Nick Cage can be really funny in action films like Con Air where his over-the-top performance is welcome. But in a film like this, where the viewer wants to take the story seriously, Cage comes across as a joke. Often he seems on the verge of laughter, or joy, perhaps at the obscene amount of money he makes just for showing up and being appealing. The geeky sidekick is reminiscent of the geek in Twister and the geeks ad infinitum that are an integral and oft annoying piece of the big budget action formulae. The public just giggles and giggles at all the high tech speak and dorky behavior. Look at Alias! The action scenes are quite silly (take the one with the blonde swinging from the door of the van). When the same blonde so easily caves into the plot of heisting the DOI after appearing to be the ethical one, I was amazed at how unbelievable this film was.At times the story is intriguing and the characters are amusing but these times are overshadowed by the overall sensationalistic Die-Hard meets Independence Day qualities (is anyone else sick of Jerry Bruckheimer's perpetually dumbed down style?)The dialogue mostly caters to the lowest common denominator (the masses), when it's not speaking over their heads, and is worthy of the critics' wrath. The Masonic/Knights Templar stuff is exciting and worthy of a film leagues beyond this one. I recommend that you put down the Dan Brown books, quit renting or buying sensational films like this and go find any book by Robert Anton Wilson to really stretch your mind on secret societies.The premise of this film would have been much better served by a Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, or Ken Russell.

The last few years with ""Pirates of the Carribean"", ""Holes"", and ""Princess of Thieves"" I am developing a real respect for Disney again. Perhaps they realized somebody needed to make family movies like they did so many years ago. This movie was just plain light fun for the whole family. My wife and I loved it and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD. I ran out today and got it. Nicholas Cage and Diane Kruger are great along with the wonderful support cast. Any fans of the Indiana Jones movies should enjoy it. It is like a modern version of one of the Harrison Ford movies.Plenty of action and excellent camera work make it a must for fans of the genre. The musical score is compelling and adds to the suspense. One of the things I truly enjoy about the movie is that it revolves around true historical events and it takes you to historical places. Does it have some implausibility, sure, but that won't stop you being glued to your seat for the whole movie. As we follow Cage from childhood in searh of a hidden Masonic treasure of great wealth we are tantalized with clues that take us to the next step. Jon Voight is great as the skeptical father, and Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the grandfather that believes in the stories of the Masonic treasure.

But they were two big to ignore.  I thought maybe the treasure was down in one of them.I dig two inches into ice and find a boat (lucky me).  But the inside of the boat has not been filled with water and then frozen.  Hm....Okay, that's a minor detail, as is this.  Nicholas Cage carrying the Declaration of Independence around in a bullet-proof glass case.  I could be wrong, but wouldn't it be a little bit heavy?Okay, okay, so he's told this woman that someone is going to steal the Declaration.  Then he sees her at the party.  He offers a very cryptic toast.  I think she'd probably put 2 and 2 together and say, ""Security, arrest this man.""The bad guys always know where to go and what they need despite not having ANY of the clues they'd need.  Why could they do this?  They had ""unlimited resources.""  In other words, the writer needed them to be able to do whatever they want, but couldn't be bothered with trying to figure out how that would be possible.Okay, my favorite one...they have to be in the bell tower at just the right time to see the shadow pointing to the right spot on the wall.  But the shadow would only be pointing there twice a year!  What if they went on the wrong day!  If they went in the winter, the shadow would be to the left of the right place, and if they went in the summer, it would be pointing too far to the right!

Each clue leads to another and finally, the treasure.National Treasure is a game of sorts - the kind played during freshmen orientation, except that it's on a much grander scale, involving the theft of the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage stars as a descendent of the Gates family whose ancestor holds the key to a national treasure. None of his forefathers succeeded in finding the treasure but Cage's character (named Benjamin Gates) was determined to uncover the mystery.He first locate the Charlotte, a boat that contained a clue to the treasure. The next clue was to be found on the back of the Declarartion of independence and Ben suggested to one of his treasure hunting partners that the only way to see what's on it is to steal it. Ben was against stealing, but the resourceful villian didn't care. So he reasoned that in order to protect the document from the villian, why not let me the good guy steal it first and while the document is in my hands, I might as well take a peek on what's on the back. He tried warning the FBI but nobody believed him. As a final resort, we went to the beautiful Abigail Chase at the National Archives who also didn't believe him. No choice, Ben had to steal it.Sounds silly? Well, it is. But the action is so well choreographed that if you can suspend your disbelief for a moment, you may actually enjoy watching it. Ben steals the document so the bad guys couldn't get it. Somehow, Abigail Chase got dragged into the whole saga. After seeing the hidden message behind the Declarartion of Independence, she was convinced that Ben Gates was on to something and she joined his team. The FBI and villians went after them. Everybody went around in circles with lots of shooting and suspense.Well, one clue leads to another. They ended up on Wall Street, inside a church, under a niche which led the way to what seemed like a very deep mine shaft. There was no treasure at the bottom. Another clue. Or so it seemed. Somehow, the stupid bad guys were tricked into leaving for the treasure at Boston while the good guys finally found it.A happy ending. Ben didn't have to go to jail.

""The Rock"" was pretty good along with ""Con Air"" and ""Gone is 60 Seconds.""  I figured with their past that I would take a chance and check this movie out.  And I wasn't disappointed with the results.The movie is about a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage).  His family members have been searching for the ""greatest treasure in the world"" for many generations and have not been able to put the clues together.  On a search for the treasure, Ben finds a clue that indicates that the treasure map is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, written in invisible ink.  One of his expedition team members Ian (Sean Bean) wants to steal the Declaration of Independence to get the treasure map.  Ben does not want to.  Convinced that Ian is going to steal the map, Ben does it himself to ""protect"" the document.  He finds clues on the back of the document and engages on a treasure hunt through history.The movie itself is really good.  It has a very good and intelligent storyline.  It all works out very well.  I like the locations that were used in the movie, such as Washington D.C. and some historical buildings in Philadelphia.  The movie  is rated PG so the action is kind of limited.  Nicolas Cage does good as Ben.  I think that he plays the same character in every movie, with the exception of ""Adaptation.""  The supporting cast is fine, with Diane Kruger being good eye-candy.  The only real question that I asked was why it was okay in Ben's mind that he could steal the Declaration of Independence and find the treasure with it, but it was bad for Ian to steal the document and do the same thing.  I guess the movie needed a bad guy.Overall I would recommend seeing this movie.  If you like history or suspense movies where you have to think a lot, then this movie is for you.  If you don't like either of those, still check out this movie because your opinion may change.",4,Really Good Movie.

I mean it seems to be the magic formula that no movie fan can resist: Explosions, buried treasure, and . . .oh yea, not a thought in its head. While this film is very clearly borrowing from ""The Da Vinci Code"" there was clearly no thought put into the ""puzzles"" in this film. Say what you will about that book (I liked it) Dan Brown at least had to think about his puzzles, he had to know about history and art history and he had to see things in paintings that other people thought nothing of. The makers of this film threw together some puzzles that are just obscure and beyond impossible. Lucky for us the characters in this film are geniuses and can solve riddles in mere seconds that in reality nobody could ever solve. This film also plays to the American mindset which thinks that any means can be justified if you wrap it in something honorable. When Ben Gates declared that he had to steal the Declaration of Independence because otherwise somebody else would steal it, I couldn't help but think about Bush's justification for hijacking the Iraqi oilfields.  This movie has other problems as well. For example, they forgot to give their wisecracker wisecracks. It was especially unfortunate for them that I have been watching season 3 of the ""Gilmore Girls"" lately, a show that excels in witty banter. It was also pretty annoying to me that peril never played a major role in this film. Never once did we really think that the heroes were in any danger. If you get left in the bottom of a cave just walk to the back wall and push the button. . .uh-huh. Why couldn't a password problem stall their mission? Why didn't they have to do research once? The answer of course being that there is no time for research when you are blowing stuff up! This film did have its moments, but most of the action sequences were ruined by some overzealous writer who had way too many ""great"" ideas (""Why don't we have Nicolas Cage block bullets with the Declaration of Independence?""). Whereas lots of films flaunt the fact that you don't need a brain cell in your head to enjoy them (""Van Wilder"" anybody?), this one was cute and tried to feed you historical myths (that I'm pretty sure they made up) in place of educational content.

There were some threats made but no one died. It would have been nice if it had a little more action, though. Jon Tureltaub does it all with touches of humor. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure has its share of Romance. But, they don't throw it on thick. That is usually the downfall of and excellent movie. There are enough clues to keep you guessing. Once again here is another one with a stunning cast. But, cage is the one who made it. Without him I don't think the movie would have surfaced.

If you can get past the really far-fetched plot and some rather deadpan Nick Cage, you can get a rather enjoyable experience if only you could stop snickering.Benjamin Gates(middle name's Franklin, what writing ingenuity!) is part of a long line of family treasure hunters. Well they prefer treasure preservers or protectors. They're after the find and the historical aspect rather than the fame/money part. There's a legend of the treasure of the Knights Templar, said to be massive and containing many treasures that could be worth millions.His quest leads him to snow buried ship the Charlotte which was a clue by one of the people who knew about it: ""the answer lies with Charlotte"".  In it he finds a pipe which has an inscription and with some quick thinking(bit too quick personally) he uncovers another clue: the treasures location rests with the Declaration of Independence, or rather the back of it in invisible ink. Only 2 of his hunting partners turn on him and are after the money only and would even burn or just chuck the document rather than preserve it.Which is of course heavily protected in a government building with anti-personnel security systems reminiscent of Mission: Impossible. After some sleuthing and high tech gadgetry, they manage to steal the document. And from then on, there's clues piled on clues including glasses that has a neat effect attached to them.Joining him is Abigail Chase played by hottie-but-somewhat-bland Diane Kruger from Troy and some guy who's name escapes me right now(sorry, guy) but he plays the obligatory comic relief. And Harvey Kietel is hunting after all 3 of them and wanting to put them in jail. And as usual, Sean Bean provides another great villain.The film's interest mainly comes from all the neat stuff the freemasons did to hide their treasure but provide enough clues like a shadow falling across a certain place of Independence Hall. Or the aforementioned glasses which can read a paper in different ways.If you're looking for Indiana Jones well don't. Looking for just a neat escape and some cool stuff then check it out.

Just as he thinks the treasure is within reach, a disagreement with a one-time friend and cohort leads to a race to steal the Declaration of Independence.It's equally silly from there, but the film's genuine love of American History and the game cast make for a good time. Both Cage and Diane Kruger (playing the love interest) do a solid job of conveying the passion of a true history buff and even manage to get you excited about it.And then there is Sean Bean, once again playing the bad guy. Let me just say this: He may be getting old and kinda flabby, but for my money he still has the world's sexiest voice (witness the way he says the word ""confetti"".). Like a souffl&eacute;, that man's voice. And as usual, he manages to make a stock character a lot more interesting with subtle touches.

626976,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JN5E,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[2, 5]","National Treasure (2004) was one of those films I meant to see in the theaters, but it seems nowadays if you don't see a film within a week or two after it's released, you're stuck waiting for the video as it gets yanked, soon to be replaced by the next blockbuster waiting in line...which is a shame as it's actually a pretty decent, family friendly film despite its various flaws.  Produced by the busiest man in show business Jerry Bruckheimer (Black Hawk Down, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Veronica Guerin), and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, Phenomenon), the film stars Nicolas Cage, who is not only slated to appear in the remake of the 1973 classic The Wicker Man, but is also cast as the title character in the upcoming Ghost Rider film, based off the popular Marvel Comic book (whether these are good or bad things, only the future can tell).  Also appearing is Diane Kruger (Troy, Wicker Park), Justin Bartha (Gigli), Sean `Boromir' Bean (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), Jon `Joe Buck' Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Deliverance), Christopher Plummer (Twelve Monkeys, Dracula 2000), and my girlfriend's favorite actor Harvey `Sport' Keitel (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver).The film begins by relating a tale of a legendary treasure (originally belonging to King Solomon) that grew to incredible proportions over the years, one that eventually came into the possession of the Templar Knights during The Crusades, who later became the Freemasons, or some such thing (history was never my bag, man).  Anyway, due to the enormity of the treasure, it was decided it was too much for one man or group to possess, so it was hidden away, its existence only hinted at by a series of seemingly unfathomable clues, some of which we see on a daily basis (check out the pictures on your paper money...there's some weird stuff going on there...like that pyramid with the eyeball).  Anyway, Cage plays Ben Gates, a man who's spent the better part of his life following the clues, as his family has intimate knowledge to support the notion that the treasure is real.  Near the beginning of the film we see Ben involved with Ian Howe (Bean), a wealthy financier with a questionable background, but the two part ways as the clues lead them to the Declaration of Independence, specifically a hidden map on the back.  Howe intends to steal the sacred document, but Ben is opposed to this as he's not really a treasure hunter, but a more of a historian interested in preserving the past not for personal gain, but for the benefit of all.  Now Ben must steal the document if only to keep it out of Ian's grubby hands, stay ahead of the FBI...and perhaps find the treasure himself, part of his motivation is that the general public believes his family a bunch of crackpots for believing in such a conspiracy, one thought to be created by the colonial fathers to keep the British busy looking for something that never existed...Overall I did enjoy this film, as it has wonderful production values and was inherent with a sense of fun.  There are some nick picky things that came up for me like if the Knights really wanted to keep the location of the treasure secret, why have all these clues laying about?  Why not hide it and let the secret of the location die with those in the know?  Because you wouldn't have a movie...also, the whole thing about Ben stealing the Declaration of Independence to keep it away from Ian...why not team up with Ian after it was stolen and work together after all (Ben tried to warn the authorities someone was going to steal it before he did, but they didn't take him seriously)?  Because we needed a bad guy element to keep the pressure on Ben to find the treasure before Ian's group...and the whole theft of the actual document seemed to come off a bit too easy, but whatever...the characters were pretty standard all around, but I did find Riley Poole (Bartha) as Ben's comic sidekick a little annoying with all his smart alecky comments.  He was supposed to be a computer whiz, but his usefulness as the story progressed seemed negligible as his skills really aren't needed much after the theft of the sacred document.  I was slightly saddened to see Voight (Ben's father), Plummer (Ben's grandfather), and Keitel (FBI agent) having such meager parts, as these guys are heavy hitters and could have brought a lot more had they'd been given the chance.  And the character played by Ms. Kruger, who was the director of the National Archive, roped into the proceedings...that whole love interest thing seemed tacked on...but fear not, there are a number of things to like about the film.  The story itself was very interesting, the finding and deciphering of the various clues, seeing how they fit into the grand scheme of things, and seeing where they led was a whole lot of fun.  There's plenty of action throughout, but surprisingly little violence and virtually no profanities, especially considering some of Bruckheimer and Cage's previous films like The Rock (1996), Con Air (1997), and Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000).  I think this stems from Disney's more direct involvement and their wanting to create a more family orientated action film, with an educational spin (which I liked).  Another thing I really liked was the location shots, many around sites of national interest.  All in all, I'd give this film 3  stars as it's a fun ride, despite a few bumps.The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) comes through beautifully, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio clear as a bell (the Liberty Bell?).  There's a good amount of extras including an `on location' featurette (11:17), deleted scenes (7:47), opening scene animatic (2:21), alternate ending w/intro (1:50), Treasure Hunters Revealed featurette (8:30), The Templar Knights featurette (4:59), Verizon tie-in promotions, and a game called Riley's Poole's Decode This, which enables one to collect codes to enable access to many of these features, including one which I haven't mention (and won't...hee hee, it's not even listed on the Amazon page, but it's not difficult to find as the puzzles are easy).  There are also some previews for other Disney films like Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), and some video releases including Tarzan II (2005) and The Pacifier (2005).Cookieman108",4,The clues are right in front of your eyes.,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,6354,"['National', 'Treasure', '2004', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'meant', 'see', 'theaters', 'nowadays',

Obviously neither he nor his agent read the script prior to signing on.This farce revolved around the theory believed by Cage, apparently a treasure seeker, and his family, that a treasure map existed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  This map would lead to the location of the National Treasure, an extensive hoard accumulated by the Knights Templar and Freemasons, and hidden from the British back in colonial times.Cage in an expedition in the Arctic uncovers a ship buried beneath the ice which holds a key to the mystery.  The probe is financed by Sean Bean, who turns bad guy and tries to kill Cage and his exceedingly annoying sidekick, Justin Bartha.  And so a race commences between Cage and Bean to steal the Declaration of Independence and ultimately uncover the treasure.Along the way, Cage recruits soon to be love interest, Diane Kruger, a head honcho working in the Archives.This flick seemed to attempt to copy a format popularized by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; swashbuckling hero, bimbo sidekick and blonde hanger on and love interest.

This kind of a mystery story has a long tradition.  It mixes real historical names, a few facts, stirs in some myths and fantasies about mason and knights templar, add some bits about treasure and a nasty villain, and then sprinkles all that on a whole loaf of nonsense and ends up with a light and fluffy bit of fun.I am not sure why this film causes such passion among those that do not like it.  It really is not that important of a film.  It is a simple family entertainment and succeeds at that quite well.  My kids love it, and I was able to watch it more as a Hardy Boys kind of story to keep from exploding, but then most fictions with any pretensions of reality set me off.There is a lot of running, gunshots that seldom hit anyone, a big explosion, some fire, a quirky sidekick for Cage's character and a beautiful girl for the hero to win and protect.  I enjoyed the fact that there was romance instead of sex and there was dialogue without swearing.

He's played the reluctant action hero in The Rock, a cartoonish icon in Con Air and the amoral bad guy in Face/Off. With National Treasure he essays a new variation-the non-violent action hero. Usually, you don't see anything of the non-violent kind in a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie and that's one of several pleasant surprises in this movie.At times, National Treasure wants to be a contemporary update of Indiana Jones. Like that character, Benjamin Gates isn't in it for the money but for a genuine love of history and the thrill of the solving the centuries old mystery.  This is a surprisingly entertaining mix of action and humour. It doesn't rely on too many cliches of the genre and tries not to insult one's intelligence.In keeping with the cracking codes and knowing something about history from the movie, each extra contains a clue at the end of it that when put together will unlock another level of supplemental materials and then another.""National Treasure on Location"" briefly touches upon the film's origins. It started with a premise: what if you stole the Declaration of Independence? It is quite an achievement that the filmmakers got to shoot on location at these famous historical landmarks.

Well, as much as I would love to have my quote on a movie trailer, I don't think I'll make the cut with ""Dang--this movie is solid!""But that's exactly what National Treasure is. It's a well-crafted mystery, a gripping action yarn, and the most entertaining (if not entirely accurate) American history lesson I've ever had. Part conspiracy theory, part Indiana Jones-style treasure hunt, there's plenty here for most everyone--especially if you happen to enjoy the history of the Declaration of Independence.Because Jerry Bruckheimer produced it, it feels like a Bruckheimer movie, with sweeping aerial shots and bombastic music by regular collaborator Trevor Rabin, but director Jon Turteltaub, thankfully, doesn't share Michael Bay's love affair with excess. Chase scenes are never overlong or needlessly complicated, and while there are several opportunities for Nicolas Cage to pose for Bay's signature circular dolly shot (seeBad BoysandThe Rock, for example), Turteltaub prefers to keep the story moving rather than take precious time to worship his lead actor.The supporting cast was...well, very supportive, if not entirely noteworthy.

626987,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JN5E,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 4]","So I read this review by this 'parent' obviously, about this movie knocking the people that say it sucked.  The 'parent' was saying pretty much the only reason you wouldn't like it was if you wanted to hear cursing and see sex.  Okay, sorry but the reason you wouldn't like this is because it's kinda stupid.  That's not to say it's not fun, it's just cheesy.  I had no desire to see this movie, none whatsoever, because (i'm sorry 'parent' for this but) IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY STUPID!!!  I'm not a real Cage fan, other than movies like 'Matchstick Men' which I thought was great.  My wife wanted to see this because her mother said it was great and my mother said it was great and her best friend said it was great but we never went to the theater because I didn't want to waste money on this movie (we saw 'Finding Neverland' instead) and so just this Friday we rented it much to my disspleasure.  I do have to say that as corny and plain dumb the plot is, the movie was very fun.  I actually enjoyed it.  I'm sure you all know the plot, Ben Franklen Gates (Cage) is a treasure hunter (or protecter, whatever) and he's been serching for the same treasure ever since he was a little boy.  I guess somewhere along the way the Gates family name was tarnished and they were all thought to be insane or just stupid (kinda like the premise of the movie)...Cage finally figures out the clue he has to find this treaure only to find out that there is just another clue, and this clue leads him to the Decloration of Independence...His partner in crime here decides they are going to steal the DoI, but when Gates objects they become enemies and now Gates is racing against the clock to stop this man from stealing the document.  Now Gates realizes he needs to steal it himself.  So he does.  And now he has the chance to uncover the rest of the clues to find the treasure.  It's fast paced, and just plain fun, no matter how stupid it is.  So this is for the 'parent' who thinks if we didn't like this movie it's because we want sex and language, your wrong.  Heck, I don't mind the occational nude scene or bloody mess of a shootout or something, but what matters most to me is plot.  I was impresed with this movie namely becasue it was fun, but it was pointless.  Yes it's a great family movie because there is no cussing and no sex and my kids can watch it and not repeat things they shouldn't, but even you have to admit the premise is just plain STUPID...the critics were right and I wholeheartedly agree...it's not a good movie as far as GOOD movies go, but it is a fun movie and one your kids can watch so as a movie goer you have to make the choice yourself, do you want a  good plot and your occational 'F' word or do you want mindless entertainment that your kids can watch with you?  Or do you rent the good movie and watch it when your kids go to sleep, maybe put this on for them while your at work?

626988,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JN5E,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Who says history is always boring?  Granted, the story of this National Treasure is pure fiction, but its roots are grounded in the history of American Independence, especially the Declaration of Independence and that wily old codger Ben Franklin.  As the story goes, a group of Crusaders found this vast treasure in the Holy Land and formed the Knights Templar in order to keep it secret and protected; that mission was taken up in turn by the Freemasons.  By the start of the Revolutionary War, Freemasons such as George Washington, Ben Franklin, and other Founding Fathers hid the treasure so that it could not possibly be discovered by the British.  They left behind a number of clues as to its existence and location, but these were all but lost - the last surviving Founding Father, unable to meet with and reveal the secret to President Andrew Jackson, passed the first clue along to a servant just before his death.  That servant's descendants have spent major portions of their lives looking for a treasure that no one else believes exists - and with no luck whatsoever.  Not, that is, until Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) came along and actually solved the first clue.  I guess it' all downhill from here, right?  Well, not exactly.The Declaration of Independence is probably the most heavily-protected document in the entire world - this thing, if I remember correctly, will actually survive a nuclear bomb if it is lowered down into its vault in time.  You can't just walk in and ask the nice National Archives folks to please open the case up and let you apply a reagent to it in order to reveal some sort of treasure map on its back.  (Gates tries it - it doesn't work.  No one will even believe his warning about his newly-acquired archenemy's plans for stealing it.)  In order to keep the document out of the wrong hands, he decides he has little choice but to steal it himself.  That's when things really start moving along - and they don't stop there, as each discovery leads to new clues about the treasure.  Continuing the quest is hard work, especially when every cop in the country is after you and your enemies want to know what you know and then kill you.Personally, I would have liked more clues scattered along the way.  Gates figures out about the map on the back of the Declaration pretty darned quickly, and the remaining clues (which really are quite ingenious) sometimes get lost in the shuffle of Gates and his partners trying to avoid capture by the feds or their treasure-hunting competitors.  I was a little concerned about the way this movie might end - would they find the treasure or not?  It was potentially a lose-lose situation either way, but I have to say National Treasure delivers an ending I can easily live with.I don't, as a general rule, like Nicolas Cage very much, but I have to say he seemed to fit himself to the character perfectly and injected plenty of energy into the entire movie.  The whole cast was very good.  Sean Bean was easy to dislike as Gates' ruthless rival in the search, Harvey Keitel was - well, he was Harvey Keitel, Justin Bartha was pretty funny as Gates' comic sidekick, and Diane Kruger was certainly an attractive addition as the curator turned ally (even though her loyalties seem to shift rather quickly).I thought this was an immensely enjoyable film - a little less than perfect in a couple of places, but well-thought-out and actually pretty believable.  It's a wonder no one thought of this sort of story already.  After all, there is plenty of Mason-related speculation about the very design of Washington, D.C.  When you get right down to it, there's just nothing like a good conspiracy story.  Unless you just don't like being entertained, I don't see how you could not enjoy National Treasure.",5,"A smart, immensely entertaining thriller",1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,3788,"['Who', 'history', 'always', 'boring', 'Granted', 'story', 'National', 'Treasure', 'pure', 'fiction', 'roots', 'are', 'grounded', 'history', 'American', 'Independence', 'especially', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'wily', 'old', 'codger', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'story', 'group', 'Crusaders', 'found', 'vast', 'treasure', 'Holy', 'Land', 'formed', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'order', 'keep', 'secret', 'protected', 'mission', 'was', 'taken', 'up', 'turn', 'Freemasons', 'start', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Freemasons', 'such', 'George', 'Washington', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'other', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'hid', 'treasure', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'discovered', 'British', 'left', 'behind', 'number', 'clues', 'existence', 'location', 'were', 'lost', 'last', 'surviving', 'Founding', 'Father', 'unable', 'meet', 'reveal', 'secret', 'President', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'passed', 'first', 'clue', 'servant', 'just', 'death', 'servant', 'descendants', 'have', 'spent', 'major', 'portions', 'lives', 'looking', 'treasure', 'one', 'else', 'exists', 'luck', 'whatsoever', 'Not', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'came', 'along', 'actually', 'solved', 'first', 'clue', 'guess', 'downhill', 'here', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly.The', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'probably', 'most', 'heavily-protected', 'document', 'entire', 'world', 'thing', 'remember', 'correctly', 'will', 'actually', 'survive', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'lowered', 'down', 'vault', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'ask', 'nice', 'National', 'Archives', 'folks', 'please', 'open', 'case', 'up', 'let', 'apply', 'reagent', 'order', 'reveal', 'sort', 'treasure', 'map', 'back', 'tries', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'will', 'even', 'believe', 'warning', 'newly-acquired', 'archenemy', 'plans', 'stealing', 'order', 'keep', 'document', 'wrong', 'hands', 'little', 'choice', 'steal', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'moving', 'along', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'discovery', 'new', 'clues', 'treasure', 'Continuing', 'quest', 'hard', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'cop', 'country', 'enemies', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'know', 'then', 'kill', 'you.Personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'clues', 'scattered', 'way', 'figures', 'out', 'map', 'back', 'Declaration', 'pretty', 'darned', 'quickly', 'remaining', 'clues', 'really', 'are', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'sometimes', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'Gates', 'partners', 'trying', 'avoid', 'capture', 'feds', 'treasure-hunting', 'competitors', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'way', 'movie', 'might', 'end', 'would', 'find', 'treasure', 'not', 'was', 'potentially', 'lose-lose', 'situation', 'way', 'have', 'say', 'National', 'Treasure', 'ending', 'can', 'easily', 'live', 'with.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'general', 'rule', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'say', 'seemed', 'fit', 'character', 'perfectly', 'injected', 'plenty', 'energy', 'entire', 'movie', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'easy', 'dislike', 'Gates', 'ruthless', 'rival', 'search', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'was', 'well', 'was', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Gates', 'comic', 'sidekick', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'was', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'addition', 'curator', 'turned', 'ally', 'even', 'loyalties', 'seem', 'shift', 'rather', 'quickly', '.I', 'thought', 'was', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'little', 'less', 'perfect', 'couple', 'places', 'well-thought-out', 'actually', 'pretty', 'believable', 'wonder', 'one', 'thought', 'sort', 'story', 'already', 'plenty', 'Mason-related', 'speculation', 'very', 'design', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'just', 'nothing', 'good', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'entertained', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'enjoy', 'National', 'Treasure']",National Treasure

Unfortunately, family friendly does not automatically translate into a fun viewing experience. Simply put, 'National Treasure' isn't a very good film, and it's beyond me how people over-rate this big-budget B-movie.No one can fault the actors for trying their best with this material, and no one can ever accuse Nicolas Cage or Jon Voight of turning in a bad performance. The problem lies in the increasingly far-fetched and condescending screenplay. We're given a senseless quest headed up by an blandly idealistic hero, who's aided by a chaste girlfriend, an unfunny 'comic relief' best friend, and a slightly world-weary father. Stock situations, stock characters, and a total lack of screenwriting inspiration.I'm a big fan of escapist movies from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'The Phantom,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. All of those films could also be considered children's movies, but all of them respect their young audiences' attention and intelligence. 'National Treasure' doesn't. In fact, while watching 'National Treasure' I developed a new appreciation for the 'Harry Potter' movies, which give their audience enough credit to solve puzzles themselves rather than having the answers thrust upon them the moment the puzzle is presented. The extras are a lot more fun than the film itself.I can understand why this film did such stellar business at the box office in the fall of 2004.

626992,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00005JN5E,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[5, 5]","I admit I enjoyed watching this movie in the theater, but still left with a feeling that it missed something. Rewatching the movie on this 2 disc special edition reminds me of the same feeling. The story is of Nicolas Cage's character having to ""steal"" the Declaration of Independence to save it from a selfish treasure hunter who only wants to use it to find a legendary treasure hidden by the forefathers of our country. What are the pluses? The fantastic location shoots; Washington DC, Boston, and Philadelphia. How exciting it is to be ""inside"" the tower of Independence Hall where the Liberty Bell once rang? Or inside the historic monuments and buildings of our nation's capitol? Diane Kruger is well cast as Abigail Chase; you believe her dilemma in choosing between protecting the Declaration and wanting to see whether the mythical treasure actually exists or not. Justin Bartha creates a memorable character of Riley, Nicolas Cage's brainy yet funny assistant. There are a number of exciting chase sequences as well, but leading us to the flaw side...I just found the movie to be somewhat lacking. In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" one can feel the excitement of the opening of the Ark or any of the other things that Indiana Jones finds along the way. The buildup here is poor. Nicolas Cage's character goes quickly from A to Z in his think-out-loud explanations of the clues, and the string of logic is very hard to believe. I like a good suspend-your-belief type movie as well as the next guy, but this flick really pushes the envelope...too much. This movie borrows from a lot of other action/chase and treasure hunt movies, mixes the elements together, but ends up with something that is less than satisfying. And the worst part is Cage himself. It was very difficult for me to believe his character through the movie; Cage doesn't so much act; he poses, gestures, and attempts to sound very intellectual. It fails for me, as I can't get past his perfectly coiffed hairplugs and fake dental work. His look does not ring true to the character he should be playing and it stands out like a sore thumb. It's also hard to believe any kind of romantic feelings on his part towards the Abigail character, as Cage almost comes off as a robot. It's a fair movie with great production values and visuals, but storywise it is just passable.The special features include a number of short featurettes; few are very indepth, and leave you with a sense of ""That's all?!?"" Each barely touches on the subject it covers. The ""NT on Location"" featurette was interesting in that you learn that the majority of what you see in the film was actually filmed on location (Independence Hall) with the exception of most of the National Archives sequences. There are a few deleted scenes to watch, and most were removed with good reason. The opening scene Animatic gives you a rough look of the opening sequence and you can  learn the intentions of Jon Turteltaub, the director. The alternate ending is also shown here; again, a wise choice was made, although it is difficult to believe Turteltaub when he states that they had no thoughts of doing a sequel when they were making this. The ""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" is (again) a short look at treasure hunting at sea and on land, focusing on the Mel Fisher collection in Key West, ending up with little kids combing beaches with metal detectors. How do you make a movie about stealing the Declaration of Independence, and then compare it to hunting coins on a beach? A true documentary on treasure hunts and greatest finds would have been a natural. This featurette is weak at best. Same case with ""The Knights of Templar"" featurette, which uses mainly clips from the film and very uninformative narration that leaves you with more questions than it answers. You can also watch the filming and thought behind the explosion of The Charlotte, the ship that was supposed to be frozen in the Arctic, but was actually shot on a soundstage and in Park City, Utah. You can also see how the creators of the film came about their method for stealing the Declaration of Independence. Originally, the documents antiquated 1957 security system allowed for a very easy explanation; 9/11 changed all that and the method had to be replanned by the film crew. Actually, in the film, this is probably the most plausible and well thought out premise of the film; the following of clues to find the treasure is where they should have spent more time!There is also a featurette on Ciphers and Codes, which allow you to play some decoding games, too. And yes, you'll have to play these as well as watch all the featurettes to be able to totally access alll the ""hidden"" featurettes. I'm not a big fan of this stuff...give me the featurettes to watch when I want to watch them. If I had time to play video games, it would be one with better thought behind it than the ones here on the disc.Overall....3 on both the movie and the extras. I still have high hopes for the sequel...except for the Cage Factor!",3,"Decent movie, decent extras...nothing too special on either",1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,5020,"['admit', 'enjoyed',

And then suddenly...it vanished.""PLOT: Nicholas Cage plays the role of Benjamin Franklin Gates, who inherited the Gates family quest of searching for the legendary treasure of the Knights Templar. The Knights blended in with the Free Masons and brought the treasure to America before the Revolutionary War. Assisting him in the search is Riley, who, let's face it, was brought along as the ""Comical Wisecracking Brainiac Assistant."" However, he also carries his role well, adding well-placed comic relief. Along for the ride is Ian (Lord of the Rings' Sean Bean), treasure-hungry yet wealthy investor who shares Ben's mission to find the treasure - but not his appreciation for its historical significance. After refusing Ian's offer to help steal the Declaration of Independence, Ben and Riley escape Ian's death trap and must match their wits against Ian's skill and bluster. Ben realizes that the only way he can stop Ian from stealing the Declaration IS to steal it. He enlists the unknowing help of National Archives employee Abigail Chase, and through an ingenious sequence of events, pulls off a hi-tech theft of the nation's founding document...barely in advance of Ian's attempt. While avoiding the understandably-upset authorities, Ben, Riley and Abigail track down further clues in hopes of locating the treasure...before Ian does.GOOD: Ben's a positive character, clearly standing for justice, truth, and the American way. (Music please) He doesn't want to steal the Declaration of Independence, but Ian's pending theft forces him to. He has an innate appreciation and awe for the document's significance, and for the history behind it. The movie does not have intentionally-inserted good-vs.-evil themes, but you know who the good guys are...and they ARE the good guys. The film is also very educational and historical. And naturally, the soundtrack is the icing on the cake...very reverent, rustic and antique.BAD: Very little to watch out for on the part of young children. There's maybe one or two swear words, if that. They kept surprising me, every time I thought they would swear, they didn't. There are dark and scary moments to look out for; Riley comes face-to-face with a frozen and half-decayed corpse rather suddenly, making him panic. Later, an ancient casket is moved, but the bottom falls through, shattering the aged bones on the ground. Ian and his thugs use a taser on a guard, shoot at Ben, and threaten him, Riley, Abigail. He also threatens Ben's father, played by Jon Voight, who does not share Ben's enthusiasm for the hunt, feeling that it has wasted the lives of the Gates family. No sexual content, except where two characters of the opposite sex change clothes in separate rooms while talking to each other. (We see them putting underwear on, but we don't see anything explicit) When Ben shows up at his father's house with Abigail in tow, his father immediately assumes she is pregnant.THOUGHTS: This is just a really good movie. What else can I say? It has all the essential ingredients needed: action, suspense, intrigue, puzzles, treasure hunts, and a little romance thrown in. It's richly woven with story, history, and intricately-woven detail. Treasure hunts aren't anything new, but the ingenuity, the skill with which the plot is crafted is amazing to watch unfold. The fact that it's ""local"" - taking place (and filmed on location) in Washington DC, about a treasure hidden by America's founding fathers - makes it all the more endearing. Nine and a half out of ten stars. (I'd give it ten, but SOMETHING has to separate it from Lord of the Rings!)BONUS MATERIALS: Sorely lacking, and it's rather irritating that you have to go through a big treasure hunt charade on the DVD before unlocking more materials...only to find that they really weren't worth the time. I have no doubt that you could find the code on a website somewhere and save yourself some time, but I really haven't checked.",5,"""A treasure...a treasure beyond all imagining...""",1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,4085,"['treasure', 'had', 'been', 'fought', 'centuries', 'tyrants', 'Pharaohs', 'Emperors', 'Warlords', 'time', 'hands', 'grew', 'larger', 'then', 'suddenly', 'vanished', 'PLOT', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'role', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'who', 'inherited', 'Gates', 'family', 'quest', 'searching', 'legendary', 'treasure', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Knights', 'blended', 'Free', 'Masons', 'brought', 'treasure', 'America', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Assisting', 'search', 'Riley', 'who', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'brought', 'along', 'Comical', 'Wisecracking', 'Brainiac', 'Assistant', 'However', 'also', 'role', 'well', 'adding', 'well-placed', 'comic', 'relief', 'ride', 'Ian', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'treasure-hungry', 'yet', 'wealthy', 'investor', 'who', 'shares', 'Ben', 'mission', 'find', 'treasure', 'not', 'appreciation', 'historical', 'significance', 'refusing', 'Ian', 'offer', 'help', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'escape', 'Ian', 'death', 'trap', 'must', 'match', 'wits', 'Ian', 'skill', 'bluster', 'Ben', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'stop', 'Ian', 'stealing', 'Declaration', 'IS', 'steal', 'unknowing', 'help', 'National', 'Archives', 'employee', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'ingenious', 'sequence', 'events', 'pulls', 'off', 'hi-tech', 'theft', 'nation', 'founding', 'document', 'barely', 'advance', 'Ian', 'attempt', 'avoiding', 'understandably-upset', 'authorities', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'Abigail', 'track', 'down', 'further', 'clues', 'hopes', 'locating', 'treasure', 'Ian', 'does.GOOD', 'Ben', 'positive', 'character', 'clearly', 'standing', 'justice', 'truth', 'American', 'way', 'Music', 'please', ""n't"", 'want', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Ian', 'pending', 'theft', 'innate', 'appreciation', 'awe', 'document', 'significance', 'history', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'intentionally-inserted', 'good-vs.-evil', 'themes', 'know', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'ARE', 'good', 'guys', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'educational', 'historical', 'naturally', 'soundtrack', 'icing', 'cake', 'very', 'reverent', 'rustic', 'antique.BAD', 'Very', 'little', 'watch', 'out', 'part', 'young', 'children', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'swear', 'words', 'kept', 'surprising', 'time', 'thought', 'would', 'swear', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'dark', 'scary', 'moments', 'look', 'out', 'Riley', 'face-to-face', 'frozen', 'half-decayed', 'corpse', 'rather', 'suddenly', 'making', 'panic', 'Later', 'ancient', 'casket', 'moved', 'bottom', 'shattering', 'aged', 'bones', 'ground', 'Ian', 'thugs', 'use', 'taser', 'guard', 'shoot', 'Ben', 'threaten', 'Riley', 'Abigail', 'also', 'Ben', 'father', 'played', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'not', 'share', 'Ben', 'enthusiasm', 'hunt', 'feeling', 'wasted', 'lives', 'Gates', 'family', 'sexual', 'content', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'opposite', 'sex', 'change', 'clothes', 'separate', 'rooms', 'talking', 'other', 'see', 'putting', 'underwear', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'explicit', 'When', 'Ben', 'up', 'father', 'house', 'Abigail', 'tow', 'father', 'immediately', 'pregnant.THOUGHTS', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'needed', 'action', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'puzzles', 'treasure', 'hunts', 'little', 'romance', 'thrown', 'richly', 'woven', 'story', 'history', 'intricately-woven', 'detail', 'Treasure', 'hunts', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'ingenuity', 'skill', 'plot', 'crafted', 'amazing', 'watch', 'unfold', 'fact', 'local', 'taking', 'place', 'filmed', 'location', 'Washington', 'DC', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'America', 'founding', 'fathers', 'more', 'endearing', 'Nine', 'half', 'ten', 'stars', ""'d"", 'give', 'ten', 'SOMETHING', 'separate', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'MATERIALS', 'Sorely', 'lacking', 'rather', 'irritating', 'have', 'go', 'big', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'charade', 'DVD', 'unlocking', 'more', 'materials', 'only', 'find', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'have', 'doubt', 'could', 'find', 'code', 'website', 'somewhere', 'save', 'time', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked']",National Treasure

627001,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JN5E,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[3, 3]","I hardly ever even heard of a movie called ""National Tresure"" until shortly before it came out but upon seeing the trailer, I figured that this is surely a movie worth checking out. It turns out that my expectations were way underestimated. While not necessarily a major smash hit in my book, Nicholas Cage's ""National Treasure"" is a really great movie full of adventure and action.The story begins during a stormy night in 1974 where a ten year old boy named Benjamin Gates stumbles upon an old book containing what are believed to be ancient stories of enormous treasures buried in unknown locations. His grandfather John Gates however tells him about how the secrets of large stashes of treasures are stored away in unknown places and that the secrets of them have been passed down several generations through his family but the clue lies on the back of the Declaration of Independence signed by George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and many others in 1776. 30 years later now as an adult, Benjamin Gates is traveling in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica with a fellow archaeologist named Ian Howe to find where they believe a clue to the treasures are located. However things go really wrong when Benjamin is betrayed by Ian.  Now Benjamin is trying to get to D.C. in order to `steal' the Declaration of Independence before Ian can obtain it in order to find clues to where the treasures are hidden. The ultimate answer to that may be surprising to whoever gets there first.I was actually pleasantly quite surprised at the good-natured family friendly feel of this movie. While not expecting something that was dark or grim (thankfully), I thought that it would be a very suspenseful and even downright creepy film since it dealt with possible ancient treasures hidden from knowledge. The movie is highly adventurous. This is far better than both ""Tomb Raider"" movies, not that they were bad necessarily. They were okay but ""National Treasure"" is much superior to those. In fact NT brings back memories of when I saw ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"" at the movie theatres when I was very little. It has the very kind of adventure patterns, character personality and dialogue of IJ. In a way, it's what makes ""National Treasure"" a really fun film to watch.Mind you the thing that says that something was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is more or less true. It's true that there was writing but based on research on the thing of something written on the back of the document it is actually written as ""The Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"" on the bottom right and upside down. It is unknown who wrote it.The acting is also really good as well even if not to the extent of making history in my book. Nicholas Cage is stellar as the eccentric adventurous Benjamin Gates as he defies the authorities in order to find out if the stories of the treasures are true or not and preventing the Declaration from being stolen by his archrival Ian Howe. To my surprise, the actor who played Boromir in ""Lord of The Rings"" Sean Bean also is a major actor in the movie as well and he's great as the antagonist rival adventurer Ian Howe to turns to the side of bad in his own attempt to find the treasure before Benjamin does. The funniest role however was the role of John Voight as Benjamin's highly disagreeing father as he and his son argue over whether or not the stories of the treasures are true or not. It's especially great to watch when he is unwillingly pulled into the adventure with Benjamin as they race against time and Ian's goons. The rest were hit and miss overall but overall the rest of the cast were decent as well.""National Treasure"" is a definite popcorn adventure flick. It does not try to pretend that it's accurate. It's almost completely fictional but blends real life things into fiction but overall, if you don't take it seriously, then you will really enjoy this movie a lot. I did.

However, that was over 200 years ago.  The Gates family has been searching for it for decades.  Benjamin Franklin Gates, played by Nicolas Cage, makes an amazing discovery that brings his family closer to retrieving the treasure than ever, however, some of his accomplices have their own ideas....'National Treasure' is a clever story.  The use of national symbols and famous historical leaders as landmarks to the treasure was simply brilliant.  In a way, the story reminded me of 'The Da Vinci Code' in how it turned the familiar backwards to tell another story.It is not, however, 'Indiana Jones' as some famous reviewers and some of the previews tried to promote it.  Ben Gates is an intriguing and likeable character, however, he just lacks the grit of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Despite that, 'National Treasure' succeeds as its own story.Overall, I'd recommend this movie to most anyone.  It has adventure, a compelling story, and likeable characters.  There are some historical inaccuracies, but nothing so glaring as to destroy the story.

627004,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00005JN5E,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Granted, NATIONAL TREASURE is silliness supreme.  To find the long-lost, priceless treasure of the Free Masons, one must steal the Declaration of Independence (there are clues on the back, don't you know).  There's also an antique pipe that opens secret passages, valuable clues in the letters of a young Benjamin Franklin, and the clue to discover when to go up into the Tower at Independence Hall is on none other than the hundred dollar bill.  I confess, I couldn't think this kind of zaniness up if I went on a month-long bender, but I'm sure glad the creative minds behind NATIONAL TREASURE did.  This is one fun ride, from one thrilling moment to the next, and the beauty of it all is the movie never takes itself seriously--so why should the viewer?Nicolas Cage can often corner the market on annoyance, but here he's wonderfully cast as notorious historian Benjamin Gates.  Ben has basically sacrificed his life to find the Free Masons treasure--plus restore his family's good name--and he's not about to let such trivial obstacles as stealing the Declaration stand in his way.  Cage dead pans his lines and deals matter-of-factly with any road blocks that constantly pop up, plus he plays smartly off comedic sidekick Justin Bartha.  Once Diane Kruger joins the treasure team playing a dedicated official of the Library of Congress, NATIONAL TREASURE gets up and moves, as our protagonists avoid the FBI (led by a smug Harvey Keitel) while simultaneously racing a determined villain (Sean Bean is stellar) to find the treasure first.  And any movie that features legendary thespian Jon Voight (as Cage's doubting father) sports an instant advantage in my book, and here Voight is as solid as ever.

It is a wild ride in the Indiana Jones vein, with some James Bond thrown in for good measure!On top of all that it also presents history in an entertaining light.  Rather than just names and dates, it shows that history is filled with STORIES - exciting stories, intriguing stories, and very entertaining stories.  It's the perfect movie to show your kids before they go into High School.  It's also a flat-out entertaining ride of a movie that will appeal to adults as well.For the generations that grew up on James Bond and Indiana Jones National Treasure is a welcomed movie.  It is not a kids movie - it's just a movie that kids over 7 or 8 can watch.  While you may have to suspend disbelief at some of the details in the movie, that isn't very hard to do (no more so than in any of the aforementioned James Bond or Indiana Jones movies).  The story is told at such a pace, and with such flair that most moviegoers (or DVD watchers) won't have either the time or the inclination to try to tear the movie apart detail by detail - that job is left to the critics whose snobbery often gets in the way of just enjoying a fun ride of a movie.  For the rest of us National Treasure is pure entertainment.Nicolas Cage is great as Ben Gates, and the supporting cast is very good as well (Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Sean Bean - he's always good, and even Christopher Plummer in a bit part as Ben's grandfather).This is a movie that proves that it is still possible to make a movie that appeals to adults while still being acceptable to parents as a movie for their kids to watch.

Benjamin Gates (soon-to-be Nicholas Cage) as a boy learns from Grandpa about a fabulous - no, *the* fabulous treasure of all times:  that fought over for millenia and then finally scored off by the Knights Templar.  (What is all this fascination with the KT?  They weren't that secret, folks.)  Somehow the Knights become Freemasons, don't ask me how?  (The Knights were Catholics and devoted to Catholicism and the Pope;  the Freemasons - well, they weren't.)  They take their treasure and bring it to America.  (Anybody know why?)  The whole movie, very jumpily cut and edited - the movie's one saving grace, actually - is about Benjamin's obsessive search for it.  (Hey, he really loved his Grandpa.)  Along the way he picks up companions Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger as eye-candy.  Anybody understand why she's from Saxony, speaks with a German accent, but her name is ""Abigail Chase""?) and Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), offering sidekicky humor.  Bad guy Ian Howe (Sean Bean) wants the treasure that is mapped on the backside of the Declaration of Independence.  You see, the Founding Fathers wanted, but simultaneously did not want people to find the treasure.  So they made it just hard enough for a summer movie audience to have to sit through a silly trail of clues - many of which double back upon themselves for no good reason.  Anyway, one thing leads to another and ... you can guess the rest.There are so many loose ends in this, so much poppycock (not the delicious snack), so many howlers, that only a good Scottish band from the Eighties could appreciate it.  Somebody please tell me why the Founding Fathers, desperate in the earlier stages of the Revolutionary War, never sought to use even part of the treasure to save the ""noble experiment.""  Their backsides were up against it in the early going.  Were they noble Freemason/Templar/citizens of the world first and patriots second?  Then why put the map on the bloody Declaration of Independence?  They knew it would preserved?  No ""we"" know it was going to be preserved as it is because we have perfect hindsight.  (Washington, DC, was burned by the British in the War of 1812 and Philadelphia was just up the road - and easily available for burning to any British force dropped off by the navy.)  The FF knew the future?  Why'd they bury the treasure on Wall Street?  (Now there's irony, eh?)  How come the subway, which shakes the descending gallery to its base, hasn't wrecked everything yet?  (BTW, the subway train only goes by once.)This movie is summer-formulaic, but less good than other such films: take two parts ""Mummy,"" stir in one part ""Indiana Jones"" (and the Holy Grail), then some ""Mission Impossible,"" and add liberally as many action-movie cliches as possible and there you have it.  It's like going to a bad barbecue.  Nick Cage is wooden - when isn't he?  Diane Kruger simply can't act.  Sean Bean is, as always, good as was Jon Voight.  Maybe the best of the bunch though is Bartha who provided some very welcome comic relief to the silly piety of Cage and Kruger.

Benjamin, however, possesses the ability to unravel the encrypted clues set before him.Ben's father, Patrick Gates (played by veteran actor Jon Voight) believes that the treasure is actually an elaborate hoax set in place to baffle the British during the time of the American Revolution at the exact timing as the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  This, as it so happens, plays a pivotal role and significant key piece to the long list of clues needed to decipher the puzzle of the treasure.Done in typical Bruckheimer fashion, the film is grand in nature even if highly unbelievable; although it's quite the rollercoaster ride you've come to expect in a film of this magnitude.  Running the gamut from Arctic Circle to burial tombs of Trinity Church, this film provides all the entertainment value required for an enjoyable night out.

Like getting an E ride for the price of an A ticket.The simple plot of a centuries old secret about a treasure map whose clues are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence has been in the family of Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) from the beginning, according to the pre-title sequence where young Ben's father (Christopher Plummer) initiates Ben's life long passion to discover what his ancestors couldn't.  Ben's partner Riley (Justin Bartha - remember him in 'Gigli'?) and eventually the beautiful Abigal Chase (Diane Kruger) slowly decode the secret with Ben, all the while being chased by former partners Ian (Sean Bean) et al and the FBI (Harvey Keitel). The caper is well written and entertainingly fast paced and if the ending is far too predictable, just take a deep breath and remember this is a Disney epic.Cage, Bartha, and Kruger make a terrific team and watching them make the best of this silly caper is proof of their talents.  If you are searching for an edge-of-the-seat heist/terror film, look elsewhere, but if a solid evening's entertainment is your goal, settle back and enjoy.

""The Rock"", ""Con Air"", and now ""National Treasure"".  None of them will go down in the annals of history as ""great"" films, but they're great ""popcorn"" films.What does this have in common with ""The DaVinci Code"", aside from the fact that they both prominently feature the Knights Templar and their treasures?  They're both puzzle races.  They begin with cryptic clues and take you on a fast-paced adventure where solving each clue leads to another tense race/chase to find the next.  The heroes are scholars, there's a brainy and beautiful female somehow drawn into their quest, and they have to get to the finish line before the bad guys either kill them or get there first.Yes, it's a formula, but so is the syrup that gets mixed with carbonated water to make the soda you'll drink while watching this.  The intellectuals, effites, and professional critics have tried to make the word ""formula"" have four letters when it applies to the plots of books or movies.  The formula for a house is four walls and a roof.  It works.  It's how you execute/implement the formula that makes it good or bad.  Some ""four walls and a roof"" formulas are called shacks while others are called palaces.The formula in this movie is a fun one when it's well executed, and ""National Treasure"" pulls it off as well as or better than ""The DaVinci Code"" in my opinion.Also, if you have the patience, the movie's extras are set up as a treasure hunt with secret code pieces embedded within the available extras.  Once you've watched them all, you can enter the code to get to the next menu of extras.

This movie is excellent. It proves that you don't need gratuitous violence, language and sex to make a movie exciting with adventure and action. Kudos to Walt Disney for bringing us an excellent movie that you can take your kids to see.The action moves at a brisk pace, never letting you catch your breath. The action is excellent and well executed and the acting and story are fabulous. The basic premise is that a group of men called the Masons were tasked with keeping vast amounts of treasure (now over 2,000 years old) out of the hands of people who would abuse it. The location of the treasure is unknown, but the Mason's have apparently left clues (such as the all-seeing eye on the 1 dollar bill) which eventually points to the Declaration of Independance as the location of a map. What transpires is an excellent movie that keeps your attention until the final scene.Nicholas Cage still has the ability to pull off a film like this with humor and wit and make it enjoyable and believable.There is shooting and one death in the movie which is probably the main reason this move is PG. The death is not graphic and it happens quickly.For children under 7, this film might be a little long in the tooth (131 minutes) for them and the story might move too fast for them to keep their attention. However, children over 7 (especially boys) will love this film. When my wife and I saw it, we weren't expecting much, especially when we saw all the children coming in.

It is also a treasure chase and it reminds us of the film The Purple Rivers 2. But it does not have the subtlety of the boo, nor the packed and physical action of the film, nor the historical depth of both. Yet it is entertaining. It of course has to deal with the best protected piece of archive in the US, i.e. the Declaration  of Independence. It deals with the freemasons of the time, with no distanciation with the secret sect they have become, particularly in Europe, to the point that Italy and Great Britain have passed laws to force freemasons who get into public offices, elected or not, to have to declare their affiliation, after some scandals in these countries a few years ago. And don't think France or Germany or any other country are immune, far from it. Of course, like all treasure chase films situated in our countries they become very touristic, and we run from Washington DC to Philadelphia to the northern pole or nearly, though we don't see the Innuits, etc. It picks the old hypothesis that the treasure of the Templars was sent to America in 1315 when the French king decide to crack down upon the order and  nationalize  their property and treasures, a  treasure that apparently either never existed or was stashed away, but no one knows where. The end is a little bit too civic to be really realistic. Such a treasure, in its very concept, is supposed to change the world because it contains many things that are at least disruptive and probably very disquieting for some institutions, the church first of all. Here the treasure is transformed into nothing but archeological riches and gold. It loses its magic and its power. The actors are quite good though the bad guys are slightly too stereotyped.

It has plenty of action and keeps the momentum going throughout, as the story blithely skirts through history in making a grand treasure hunt out of looking for the lost gold of the Knights Templar and early Masons of America.  What I found so amusing is how Turteltaub made a baton out of the Declaration of Independence as it changed hands back and forth between the good guys and the bad guys.  Hard to imagine such a venerable document surviving the tortures it was put through.  Nicholas Cage and Jon Voight essentially reprise the roles of Indiana Jones and his father in this movie.  Christopher Plummer and Harvey Kietel add further star power to the movie, but it is the fetching Diane Kruger who gives this movie sparkle with her winsome good nature. Don't expect much of a history lesson here.  The film plays into all the intrigues surrounding the Founding Fathers and the writing of the Declaration of Independence, but it does provide some interesting tidbits on Benjamin Franklin, turning his famous colored spectacles into a device for reading the legend on the back of the Declaration of Independence.

627057,AUKLLB4J4YHNA,B00005JN5E,Jason!,"[0, 6]","Well, the movie was put out by Disney.  Its pretty well known that Walt Disney was a Mason, so I'm sure this release was fairly calculated to present the more and more popular topic of the Masons and Templars.  Ever since ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" (1984? way before Da Vinci Code fame of Dan Brown) by Michael Blaigent and co, there have been more and more popular works available for the public to consume on the topic of the Masons and Templars.  So perhaps this was an official discourse meant to influence public opinion on the ""secret societies"" coming from an actual Mason outlet (Disney).National Treasure paints the secret guardians of wealth and power as great patriots, preserving a wealthy treasure from the hands of evil.  Nick Cage's character, in traditional Disney film fashion, saves this treasure from the bad guy in the course of traveling up and down the East Coast to historical sites for clues.  The overall story is creative, consisting of clues to the treasure left in hidden on very prominent items like the Liberty Bell, Goodfellow Letters, etc.Its a nice family movie.  A perfect vehicle to inform the public consciousness with an appealing view of Templars and Masons, who just happen to run every bank in the world.I must say that it would be a cooler story, though not as generally apreciated, if they traced the actual history of the Templars through their inception as guardians of the pilgramage highways to the Holy Land, to turning on the Church after some important discovery, to creating virtually every modern marketting system (credit cards, cheques), to the Berenger Sauniere story, and all the name changes the organization has gone through.  There are lots of reasons to do a real story on the group, whether it be based on all the occult stuff or not.

With an enormous fortune at stake and a family honor to restore, Gates sets out to decipher a nearly endless progression and certainly complex set of clues bequeathed to him by the early Masons. The search takes him to the frozen Arctic and then back through the winding cobblestone streets of Boston. Each cryptic secret unraveled, leads him to another and then another and so on. Along the way, he must compete with an equally competent and certainly ruthless team of fellow treasure hunters. Further, they must stay clear of the Federal police, and try not to disappoint his father. What is discovered is that whoever designed the map's instructions did not wish to make the treasure easy to find. As a result, three generations of Gates are involved in the hide-and-go seek game of a life time. A unique film for Cage as we tend to view him as the epitome of bad guys.

The secret concerns incalculable riches that have been passed down from ancient times and were hidden by the nation's founders, whose Masonic identities linked them to the hoard. Nicolas Cage, as Ben Franklin Gates, is the latest heir of the secret. He must outwit and outlast greedy rivals, a dubious federal government and a father hoping to bury the family's embarrassment.""National Treasure"" is fast-paced and exciting, with Nicolas Cage constantly outwitting his enemies and unraveling clues. Cage's sidekicks are terrific too. Abigail Chase is smart, funny and vulnerable as Diana Kruger -- archivist at the National Archives -- and Cage's love interest. Justin Bartha -- as computer whiz Justin Poole -- is nebbishy and funny, and makes even Cage's history-geeky character look manly by comparison. John Voigt capably plays Cage's embittered father while Sean Bean plays yet another capable villain intent on grabbing the treasure for himself.The movie includes more comedy than I expected, but is never too taxing on the brain. It moves too fast to let the viewer think about the plausibility that the nation's founders incorporated a treasure map into the country most sacred documents. The idea that two separate groups plan break-ins on the same night into the National Archives ought to leave one's head spinning. But in the end, you are caught in the movie's web, wondering how these delightful characters will manage to pull off their feats of derring-do and decipherment, all on the way to locating a treasure whose extent and identity no one is quite sure of.The DVD extras are OK.

I submit a third certainty to this list: if the critics hate it, without a doubt I am going to LOVE IT.  Why?  I'm not quite certain, but it just seems to be the case virtually ALL the time (at least with me anyway).First off, National Treasure probably would not have been made if not for the phenomenal success of The Da Vinci Code.  The similarities are too close to be a coincidence.  The success of BOTH however is NO accident.  It is rare that I go to the movies looking for an opportunity to increase my intellect.  I generally go to have FUN and escape from the real world for a while, same reason why I take my family to Disneyland, I just hope to escape and enjoy myself.  I have no doubt in my mind if The Da Vinci Code had not have been printed, this movie would simply not exist...I suppose I could be wrong, but I'm willing to wager I'm not.  Either way, WHO CARES?  For all the same reasons why Dan Brown's novel is so entertaining, National Treasure places that energy and love of history onto the big screen and for the most part, the payoff is well worth it.FORGET how plausible the film is.  When was the last time you saw a Hollywood blockbuster movie and came away believing ANY of it?  This film was meant for entertainment, pure and simple.  For those who cannot enjoy anything without dissecting every scene and annoyingly break it apart frame by frame, well this movie was definitely NOT made for them.  There is a great portion of this movie which is simply impossible to believe, yet the vast majority of those who saw this movie enjoyed it anyway because the Producers seemed to catch the vision of what the movie was all about and set out to simply have some genuine fun along the way, and the results?  Well the results tend to be a tremendously popular film which earns a boatload of money and screams for a sequel.  Part of me would LOVE one, but I also have to remind myself just how often Hollywood literally ruins sequels.  Maybe I'd rather just enjoy the one unless they can at the very least do another one AS good as the original...but I'm not going to hold my breath.Let me also say that despite the fact that I have enjoyed many films with Nicolas Cage, I have never really enjoyed him in particular and kind of always felt he was viewed as being a lot better than he really was -- at least to me...but I must admit this movie really changed my mind, much like how Ghost made me appreciate Whoopie Goldberg after disliking literally everything she had made up to that point.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie was perfectly cast, but they certainly did a good job.

They run around historical sites in New England, which keeps the movie interesting as well. The love story between Cage and Kruger works because they have a common reverence for history and they work well together. The clues are obtuse, but they make sense in an esoteric sort of way. Justin Bartha, Cage's sidekick, keeps making fun the clue-solving process, which keeps the audience involved. The bad guys are bad, but they are intelligent.

His grandfather (Christopher Plummer) and father (Jon Voight) have spent years searching for the treasure of the Knight's Templar.  The treasure has been kept secret for years by the Freemasons.  Now, Ben decides to carry on the family tradition and search for the treasure himself.  Ben, along with two friends, head to Antarctica in search of the first clue.  After finding it, Ben discovers that a hidden map may be on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  Ben is betrayed by one of his friends, played by Sean Bean.  Soon, its a race to Washington D.C to see who can get their hands on the Declaration first.Along the way, Ben and his other friend Riley, played by Justin Bartha, enlist the help of a woman (Diane Kruger) in Washington who's overseeing the public display of the Declaration.  Will Ben get his hands on the Declaration first, or will he be too late?This is a great movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  I was amazed at the plot and how well the movie flowed.  I was kept guessing throughout the entire move. I watched the move with my three young children, and they absolutely loved it.  Jon Voight does a marvelous job as the elder Gates, and it was enjoyable to watch his transformation as being totally against searching for the treasure to totally embracing the search.  Nicholas Cage is excellent as the cunning and resourceful Ben Gates; Sean Bean is equally as good as Gates' former friend turned adversary, and Justin Bartha does a good job as Ben's loyal friend Riley.I give this movie my highest recommendation.

In fact, it is the sort of movie you can take the kids to, without having to worry about violence and sex--so it has that going for it.On the other hand, it isn't a good movie, either.  It's the sort of mind-numbing, high-concept Hollywood adventure flick Bruckheimer is known for, and if you're into his other movies, you'll probably like this one, too.I didn't so much mind the implausibility of the basic scenario; I went into the movie expecting it.  What was far more bothersome was that characters act in a manner that, well, believeable characters never would--and even flash-and-bang Hollywood adventure blockbusters need believeable characters.  Would the FBI REALLY let run loose the guy who stole the Declaration of Independence, even if it was to catch other bad guys?  Would they REALLY not surround them the FIRST chance they got?  Hardly.  Would the bad guys REALLY hand over vital ""stuff"" to the hero?  Uh--no.  And this isn't even to mention the silly ease with which they managed to steal the Declaration in the first place.It's hard not to like something about a treasure-hunt movie that involves Knights Templar, Freemasons, and old blueblood families long fallen into dishonor.

In every movie he's ever been in, every line he says sounds like he just woke up from a deep sleep. He is a terrible, terrible actor. Watching him is painful.With that said, National Treasure is a movie about the greatest treasure on earth, hidden by America's Founding Fathers who were also members of the Lucifer worshipping cult known as 'The Free Masons'.Anyone with a brain or an inkling of history knows that Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Paul Revere, John Adams, John Hanncock, and the rest of the Founding Fathers were freely shackled to the chains of Satan by surrendering their eternal souls to Free Masonary. Washington DC is one of the most evil cities in all the world. It is shaped in a pentagram and is has demonic symbols and statues littered throughout the city. America was founded on the sick minds of the Free Masons who drank blood, raped animals, and worshipped their evil masters who reign in hell. I would not be surprised to discover that George Washington himself had sodomized Benjamin Franklin with a flaming torch as he spoke The Lord's Prayer backwards.As far as the movie goes, it is totally believeable, because America is a greedy country that hoardes stolen treasure and it's most sacred documents like the Declaration of Independence are thinnly disguised papers of witchcraft and evil.Nicholas Cage again must bore us with his monotone acting, his expressionless deadpan face, those eyebrows that someone needs to burn off, and deadpan excuse for acting.

Well, that could be an accurate description of this film.  Oddly enough it has certain traits in common with THE DAVINCI CODE.  Namely, like the CODE, the plotting is fast and furious, but the history and other details is lacking.  While Brown did such things as having a jet turn around in a hanger with its jets on (yeah, right), this movie does such things as having people run around DC waving guns and not getting noticed.Benjamin Gates (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Nick in the film) belongs to a family that guards the last clue to a treasure greater than any man should have (and his name is Gates?).  Many members of his family have tried to unravel the clue that they guard and as a result have wasted money and ruined reputations.  But Ben manages to figure out the clue and that leads to a new clue that has something to due with the Declaration of Independence.  It also causes a schism in the treasure hunting party and now two groups are after the treasure.  One clue leads to another and we are treated to a tour of our nation's historical places.  Unfortunately many of the facts revealed are false.But despite the false information, the movie is quite fun and very enjoyable.  Cage, who has been an action hero, does a great job as the action anti-hero.  An excellent cast supports his efforts.  The writing is fast and entertaining.  Cage at one point has to give a false name and uses Brown (wonder where that came from).  This is fun and adventure that the whole family can enjoy.For those who want to know a little more about the mistakes, read on.  Lemon juice, as many kids know, is an invisible ink that is revealed when heated.  Used as it is in the movie, it would have obscured the clues, not revealed them.

Also, in the grand tradition of Bruckheimer, everything old in the world was designed by Disneyworld: it's never JUST a basement - it's a rollercoaster leading to a basement.  The have lights and machinery that still work after two hundred years of neglect.  The plot hinges on a series of riddles that are so dumb, NOBODY should ever be able to figure them out, but Nicholas Cage does.What is the point of the movie?

And if such a treasure existed, how did George Washington get it, and why would he ever keep it a secret?To ask such questions is wrong of such a movie.

627099,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JN5E,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 4]","Walt Disney Pictures has sure hit a streak of massive live-action box office triumphs of late. Usually Disney does well with their animated films, but for the most part their live-action movies just don't quite add up to the same box office success. However, in recent years Disney's managed to change their luck, sure there've been a couple of flops here and there (""The Shaggy Dog"" remake), but those have been massively overshadowed by their successful releases, such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and the sequels that followed, ""Remember the Titans"", and ""Hidalgo"". One movie of Disney's that actually surprised both audiences by how good it was, and critics with how well it did at the box office, would have to be the Nicolas Cage, 'Indiana Jones' inspired, action/adventure film ""National Treasure"".""National Treasure"" is about a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) who along with his partner Riley (Justin Bartha) are seeking this lost treasure of the Knights Templar that Ben's grandfather had told him about. It turns out the Gates family has been trying to find this secret treasure for years and have never succeeded, but Ben is getting closer. With clues hidden in numerous places, Ben and Riley are inching closer and closer to finding the treasure. However, Ben isn't like most treasure hunters, his only goal is to find the treasure and divide it amongst various museums so that all the world can see. But they aren't the only ones who know of the treasure, a rogue treasure hunter (Sean Bean), who used to work with Ben until he betrayed him, is searching for the treasure as well, and his motives are not nearly as pure. As both close in on the final clues, each man comes to the realization that the biggest clue lies in Washington D.C. on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Now, Ben will attempt to steal the Declaration of Independence for two reasons, one is that he hopes he can find the answers to solve the clues that has consumed his family for generations, and secondly, to protect the document from reaching his competitor's hands, who will use the treasure for his own selfish gains.""National Treasure"" is actually one of those movies that looks good from the trailers, but also leaves you wondering if it's just a knock-off of some previous hit movie ('Indiana Jones' trilogy, in this case). But surprisingly, even though there are elements that are similar to Steven Spielberg's classic trilogy, this film does deliver to audiences a truly engaging and entertaining escape that feels both fresh and new. Director Jon Turtletaub (""Phenomenon"") and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer ('Pirates of the Caribbean' movies) have taken what was most likely a run-of-the-mill action/adventure and spiced it up to become better than it actually was destined to be. Truth be told, the basic story is fairly formulaic and easy to predict, but the solid performances, fun action sequences, and even some really funny bits of comedy give the movie a much more polished feel. The story actually did have some interesting bits of trivia about our nation's history sprinkled throughout as part of the clues, which I felt was a neat touch, and just the way each of the clues linked up was very well thought out, which also assisted in elevating the basic plot from your average action movie.The actors all do very well with their roles Nicolas Cage gives a more low-key performance that doesn't appear to include his usual quirkiness that he's so well known for. Sean Bean is right on in the role of the rogue treasure hunter, villains are roles that Bean plays very well, and he always manages to entertain. Justin Bartha provides the bits of comedy that were used to break up the adventurous overtones, without them feeling out of place or forced. Cameo appearances by Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, and Harvey Keitel are all entertaining and fun to see, although I guess Voight's role is a little more than a cameo but he's only in the latter half of the film.""National Treasure"" is a solid, action/adventure film that has a little something for everyone, and can be enjoyed by the whole family, and as a little bonus you may even learn some bits of trivia that you never even knew about our country.""National Treasure"" is rated PG for violence.",4,Let the Search Begin...,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,4326,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'sure', 'hit', 'streak', 'massive', 'live-action', 'box', 'office', 'triumphs', 'late', 'Usually', 'Disney', 'well', 'animated', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'live-action', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'same', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'However', 'recent', 'years', 'Disney', 'managed', 'change', 'luck', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'been', 'couple', 'flops', 'here', 'there', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'remake', 'have', 'been', 'massively', 'overshadowed', 'successful', 'releases', 'such', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', 'sequels', 'followed', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Hidalgo', 'One', 'movie', 'Disney', 'actually', 'surprised', 'audiences', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'critics', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', ""'Indiana"", 'Jones', 'inspired', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'National', 'Treasure', 'National', 'Treasure', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'partner', 'Riley', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'are', 'seeking', 'lost', 'treasure', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Ben', 'grandfather', 'had', 'told', 'about', 'out', 'Gates', 'family', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'secret', 'treasure', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'succeeded', 'Ben', 'getting', 'closer', 'clues', 'hidden', 'numerous', 'places', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'are', 'inching', 'closer', 'closer', 'finding', 'treasure', 'However', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'most', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'only', 'goal', 'find', 'treasure', 'divide', 'amongst', 'various', 'museums', 'world', 'can', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'know', 'treasure', 'rogue', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'Ben', 'betrayed', 'searching', 'treasure', 'as', 'well', 'motives', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'pure', 'close', 'final', 'clues', 'man', 'realization', 'biggest', 'clue', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'back', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Now', 'Ben', 'will', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'solve', 'clues', 'consumed', 'family', 'generations', 'secondly', 'protect', 'document', 'reaching', 'competitor', 'hands', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'treasure', 'own', 'selfish', 'gains', 'National', 'Treasure', 'actually', 'one', 'movies', 'good', 'trailers', 'also', 'wondering', 'just', 'knock-off', 'previous', 'hit', 'movie', ""'Indiana"", 'Jones', 'trilogy', 'case', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'are', 'elements', 'are', 'similar', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'classic', 'trilogy', 'film', 'deliver', 'audiences', 'truly', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'escape', 'fresh', 'new', 'Director', 'Jon', 'Turtletaub', 'Phenomenon', 'uber-producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', ""'Pirates"", 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'have', 'taken', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'run-of-the-mill', 'action/adventure', 'spiced', 'up', 'become', 'better', 'actually', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'basic', 'story', 'fairly', 'formulaic', 'easy', 'predict', 'solid', 'performances', 'fun', 'action', 'sequences', 'even', 'really', 'funny', 'bits', 'comedy', 'give', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'feel', 'story', 'actually', 'did', 'have', 'interesting', 'bits', 'trivia', 'nation', 'history', 'sprinkled', 'part', 'clues', 'felt', 'was', 'neat', 'touch', 'just', 'way', 'clues', 'linked', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'also', 'assisted', 'elevating', 'basic', 'plot', 'average', 'action', 'movie.The', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'roles', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'more', 'low-key', 'performance', ""n't"", 'appear', 'include', 'usual', 'quirkiness', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'right', 'role', 'rogue', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'villains', 'are', 'roles', 'Bean', 'very', 'well', 'always', 'entertain', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'bits', 'comedy', 'were', 'used', 'break', 'up', 'adventurous', 'overtones', 'feeling', 'place', 'forced', 'Cameo', 'appearances', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'are', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'see', 'guess', 'Voight', 'role', 'little', 'more', 'cameo', 'only', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'National', 'Treasure', 'solid', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'little', 'bonus', 'may', 'even', 'learn', 'bits', 'trivia', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'country', 'National', 'Treasure', 'rated', 'PG', 'violence']",National Treasure

It follows the story of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), who is a sixth generation treasure hunter, and remarkably, the only one who has ever come close to figuring out the only clue given to his great-great-great-great grandfather by the last surviving member of the original group that hid the treasure.The story is full of action from the practically beginning, where Gates solves the clue that had been plaguing his family since the 1840s. The clue, the secret lies with Charlotte, was finally solved by Gates and started a series of events that solves the mystery.The only thing is that all of the Gates family prior to Ben had to be complete idiots, as the clues the founding fathers had left, were remarkably simple, and could have been solved by anyone with a general understanding of American History. If you can look past the simplicity of the clues, you can see that the movie has a lot of high points and there's a lot of things that could be overlooked if you didn't watch it more than once.As far as special features, there is a mini-game meshed within the special features, in which you unlock more and more parts of the special features disc, ultimately leading up to a pop-up commentary version of the film that gives you little quips about American History at various points of the film.

When I watched this movie, it seemed like the actors were the Goonies all grown up: a treasure map, a quest, being followed by bad guys, having the treasure close at hand, realizing it's gone and finally finding it again in the end.You've got the good guys: Nicholas Cage who plays the trusting and dedicated scientist Ben Gates; the soon-to-melt ice queen, Abigail Chase played by Diane Kruger; and their trusty side-kick, the Robin to Cage's Batman , Riley Poole, a computer hacker and goof ball extraordinaire, fabulously played by Justin Bartha.  And the bad guys: tough-talking Ian Howe, played by Sean Bean, who doesn't quite have the smarts of the good guy, and of course, Ian's blundering yet endearing henchmen.There are parts that smack of Indiana Jones, as you get to meet Ben's father who gets taken along for the ride. But it doesn't quite have the glitter of the illustrious Harrison Ford series. But what it does have is a refreshing break from bloody violence and coarse language. No nudity either, as we have to watch Cage and Kruger undress through the dressing-room doors. I don't think we've missed anything there! And it does have some magnificent scenery and some very video game-like computer graphics (I foresee a very easy transition there!).Had the makers adhered to more historical truth and only fleshed it out with fiction, this could have been an intellectually enjoyable film for adults. But as it stands it's still a great film for kids. It's the kind of film to get the imagination going, especially when you're 8-10 years old.

This movie got bad reviews.  Not even bad - abysmal reviews.  And do you wanna know why?  After everything is said and done, it's because there's no sex, no foul language, and it's entertaining instead of disturbing.  Well we can leave them to the business of deciding what our likes and values ""should"" be, and we they can pontificate why movies they view with disdain end up as year-end blockbusters.  With that being said, I feel I should come from a different angle.  This movie is also NOT an anti-Christianity film (and I find it interesting that people would equate it as such, seeing as there are so many other mediums that are).  The plain and simple facts: pretty much everyone involved in shaping this country: from establishing it, to breaking from England, from the signing of the Declaration of Independence, to the men we've elected as Presidents have been Christians.  ALSO, more than half the men that signed the Declaration were Masons.  Simple facts.  George Washington was a Mason.  Ben Franklin was a master mason.  Lodges were established pretty much everywhere across the East Coast.  There's no way to dispute these things because they happened.  Coming to the conclusion that masonry is anti-Christian just shows a lack of knowledge on the subject (especially since most masons are Christian to begin with).  This is a completely different topic (something that I wouldn't mind discussing with anyone via e-mail), so onto the movie.It's well written, interesting, with a cliff-hanger look into history that more than acknowledges Dan Brown.  (By the way, Dan Brown's new book is on the same subject as this movie.  I'm not sure which is interdependent.)  It's well produced, well casted, with very few lagging moments.  The story is great and the American historical sights are filmed very well, showing masonic influence in virtually everything our Founding Fathers did.  I really don't see how this can be construed as negative.  Perhaps critics don't like Disney.Seeing an early edition DVD of this movie, I can say that the special features are certainly lacking.  Putting any type of ""history channel"" type documentary of the evolution of templars-to-masons would have been nice.  Even masonry in American history would have been good.  Basically, there's a 5 minute mini-history that covers the same ground as the movie or is common knowledge.  Perhaps the ""special edition"" will have more.  The lacking special features pales to the greatness of the movie.  One of the best!Overall: 9 out of 10.",5,In Our Day and Age... ****1/2,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2693,"['National', 'Treasure', 'proof', 'what', 'common', 'listeners', 'movie', 'goers', 'readers', 'observers', 'have', 'suspected', 'long', 'time', 'critics', 'are', 'usually', 'wrong/stupid', 'movie', 'got', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Not', 'even', 'bad', 'abysmal', 'reviews', 'do', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'why', 'everything', 'said', 'done', 'sex', 'foul', 'language', 'entertaining', 'instead', 'disturbing', 'can', 'leave', 'business', 'deciding', 'what', 'likes', 'values', 'should', 'be', 'can', 'pontificate', 'why', 'movies', 'view', 'disdain', 'end', 'up', 'year-end', 'blockbusters', 'being', 'said', 'feel', 'should', 'come', 'different', 'angle', 'movie', 'also', 'NOT', 'anti-Christianity', 'film', 'find', 'interesting', 'people', 'would', 'equate', 'such', 'seeing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'mediums', 'are', 'plain', 'simple', 'facts', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'involved', 'shaping', 'country', 'establishing', 'breaking', 'England', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'men', ""'ve"", 'elected', 'Presidents', 'have', 'been', 'Christians', 'ALSO', 'more', 'men', 'signed', 'Declaration', 'were', 'Masons', 'Simple', 'facts', 'George', 'Washington', 'was', 'Mason', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'was', 'master', 'mason', 'Lodges', 'were', 'established', 'pretty', 'much', 'everywhere', 'East', 'Coast', 'way', 'dispute', 'things', 'happened', 'Coming', 'conclusion', 'masonry', 'anti-Christian', 'just', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'especially', 'most', 'masons', 'are', 'Christian', 'begin', 'completely', 'different', 'topic', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'discussing', 'anyone', 'e-mail', 'so', 'movie.It', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'cliff-hanger', 'look', 'history', 'more', 'acknowledges', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'way', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'new', 'book', 'same', 'subject', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'interdependent', 'well', 'produced', 'well', 'casted', 'very', 'few', 'lagging', 'moments', 'story', 'great', 'American', 'historical', 'sights', 'are', 'filmed', 'very', 'well', 'showing', 'masonic', 'influence', 'virtually', 'everything', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'did', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'negative', 'Perhaps', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Disney.Seeing', 'early', 'edition', 'DVD', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'certainly', 'lacking', 'Putting', 'type', 'history', 'channel', 'type', 'documentary', 'evolution', 'templars-to-masons', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Even', 'masonry', 'American', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Basically', '5', 'minute', 'mini-history', 'same', 'ground', 'movie', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Perhaps', 'special', 'edition', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'pales', 'greatness', 'movie', 'One', 'best', 'Overall', '9', '10']",National Treasure

It's a great flick--intelligent without being too complex (so you get into the story without wondering too much about the technicalities of whether all the ""facts"" are accurate or not), action-packed without being anything like some bloodbaths, and powered by noble intentions.The fact that the bad guy who doesn't care anything about the Declaration of Independence and what it stands for appears to be English bothered me a little.  Okay, it could happen; there could be a bad English guy who didn't care about the Declaration.  Still, I would rather have seen someone with an American accent in this role--Amazon is loaded with reviews complaining about the unfair portrayal of Americans in Love Actually, but I don't see a lot of English people complaining about unfair portrayal of Brits in this movie.But I hate to dwell on stereotypes, and I really doubt that Disney intended to perpetuate one with the bad guy's character.I've seen people comparing this movie to the Indiana Jones movies, and I like this one better!  The gory images of Indiana Jones haunted me in childhood, but National Treasure sticks to suspense for most of its thrills.As someone who minored in anthropology in college, I can't really condone the treatment of important archaeological sites in the movie.  Since it is just a movie (and the plot explains why time is of the essence), the archaeological aspect wouldn't bother me if it weren't for one of the DVD bonus features.  The feature talks about treasure hunters and how to get started as a treasure hunter, but it doesn't point out that people need to respect burials and remains or that they should report important finds and try to leave sites as intact as possible.  We didn't watch all the bonus features, so there may be some mention of this kind of thing elsewhere on the DVD.The DVD extras are fun, though.  It's clever to have different levels of features open as clues are figured out.  I'm not sure I'd want to go through the process repeatedly, but it's entertaining once or twice.As I said, I liked the movie a lot.

Ever since ""The Da Vinci Code"" was published, much has been said about the Knights Templar and the existence of a magnanimous treasure, sometimes with religious implications, sometimes, as is the case in ""National Treasure"", just related to pure mutiny.  I was never a fan of American history, yet this movie has managed to lit up my interest in it.The story centers around Benjamin Franklin Gates, a role impersonated by Nicolas Cage.  A descendant of THE Benjamin Franklin, historian, engineer and Navy ROTC Ben Gates is on a quest after a family's life pursuit about the ancient treasure of the Knights Templar, that somehow seems to have found its way to America during the Revolutionary War, and was hidden in this land by the Freemasons who, among others, counted the names of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin himself as members.  But the Gates family has been the laughing stock of the historical community in Washington D.C. for generations due to the elusiveness of said treasure.  Just when Ben Gates appears to have found someone rich enough and willing to fund a costly search that includes an expedition to the Arctic, Ben realizes that not everyone has the same solemn intentions as he does when it comes to finding the greatest treasure ever coveted by mankind.  For starters, the clues leading to its discovery are to be found in the Declaration of Independence... but how does one get to it and, more importantly, how can the clues be interpreted?  Ben has his friend and co-conspirator Riley Poole, played by hilarious Justin Bartha, and National Archives expert Dr. Abigail Chase (played by Diane Kruger) as his right and left hands to help him.This is the premise of ""National Treasure"", a movie which unpacks fun and loads of action while taking the viewer on location to the National Archives and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, and the catacombs under Trinity Church in New York City.I have enjoyed it immensely, especially the historical aspect.  Although the acting is not stellar by any means, one must admit that Sean Bean still offers a fantastic view of the human male species even when he is getting on years, and the feminine element offered by Diane Kruger as Dr.  Chase is... cute, though sometimes borderline callous.True to a Jerry Bruckheimer production, the film offers great photography, and the 2-disc Collector's Edition is jam-packed with extras presented in the form of a treasure hunt, my favorites being ""Riley's Decode This!"", with three levels of discovery; and the featurette on ""Ciphers, Codes & Codebreakers"", a great documentary on code making and breaking that goes back to the first World War.  The deleted scenes offer much needed background to the film, although it is understandable how they did not make it into it - at 2:35 hours, nothing else could go in.",4,A must-see for lovers of history and action alike,1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,2951,"['Who', 'would', 'not', 'wonder', 'idea', 'stealing', 'national', 'treasure', 'Ever', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'published', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'existence', 'magnanimous', 'treasure', 'sometimes', 'religious', 'implications', 'sometimes', 'case', 'National', 'Treasure', 'just', 'related', 'pure', 'mutiny', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'American', 'history', 'yet', 'movie', 'managed', 'lit', 'up', 'interest', 'it.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'role', 'impersonated', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'A', 'descendant', 'THE', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'historian', 'engineer', 'Navy', 'ROTC', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'quest', 'family', 'life', 'pursuit', 'ancient', 'treasure', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'somehow', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'America', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'was', 'hidden', 'land', 'Freemasons', 'who', 'others', 'counted', 'names', 'George', 'Washington', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'members', 'Gates', 'family', 'been', 'laughing', 'stock', 'historical', 'community', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'generations', 'due', 'elusiveness', 'said', 'treasure', 'Just', 'when', 'Ben', 'have', 'found', 'someone', 'rich', 'enough', 'willing', 'fund', 'costly', 'search', 'expedition', 'Arctic', 'Ben', 'not', 'everyone', 'same', 'solemn', 'intentions', 'when', 'finding', 'greatest', 'treasure', 'ever', 'coveted', 'mankind', 'starters', 'clues', 'leading', 'discovery', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'how', 'one', 'get', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'can', 'clues', 'be', 'interpreted', 'Ben', 'friend', 'co-conspirator', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'played', 'hilarious', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'National', 'Archives', 'expert', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'played', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'right', 'left', 'hands', 'help', 'him.This', 'premise', 'National', 'Treasure', 'movie', 'fun', 'loads', 'action', 'taking', 'viewer', 'location', 'National', 'Archives', 'Library', 'Congress', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Liberty', 'Bell', 'Philadelphia', 'catacombs', 'Trinity', 'Church', 'New', 'York', 'City.I', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'especially', 'historical', 'aspect', 'acting', 'not', 'stellar', 'means', 'must', 'admit', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'still', 'fantastic', 'view', 'human', 'male', 'species', 'even', 'when', 'getting', 'years', 'feminine', 'element', 'offered', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Dr.', 'Chase', 'cute', 'sometimes', 'borderline', 'callous.True', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'production', 'film', 'great', 'photography', '2-disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'jam-packed', 'extras', 'presented', 'form', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'favorites', 'being', 'Riley', 'Decode', 'three', 'levels', 'discovery', 'featurette', 'Ciphers', 'Codes', 'Codebreakers', 'great', 'documentary', 'code', 'making', 'breaking', 'back', 'first', 'World', 'War', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'offer', 'much', 'needed', 'background', 'film', 'understandable', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'make', '2:35', 'hours', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'go']",National Treasure

He is in Washington D.C. in his grandfathers basement. He stumbles into a book about the treasure. Then his grandfather finds him in the basement and he asks him what he is looking at. Ben tells him its about some treasure. By the way, the name of the treasure is  The Kinghts of the Templar's treasure. He tells Ben that last signer of the constitution that was alive was about to die, he wanted to tell the President, Andrew Jackson about the treasure but, when he got to the White House President Jackson wasn't there so he told his coach boy Thomas Gates that there is a treasure that is in a secret place and with his dying breath he told that the secret lies with Charlotte. Then Ben's grandfather tells him that treasure existed during egyptian times, During the  christian crusades some of the crusaders took the treasure with them. Then it was brought over to America by the Knights of the Templar and During the Revolutionary war the British went looking for the treasure by looking for the clues. The Knights of the Templar in America began to be called Free Masons. People that were Free Masons were Geogre Washington,Thomas Jefferson,Benjamin Franklin,Paul Revere,John Adams, and John Hanncock. Then at the end of the story Ben's grandfather gives him a piece of paper with the clue the secret lies with Charolate on it. Then he tells him to use clue to look for the treasure. Then Ben asks him if he can be a knight like the Templar Knights. His grandfather then knights him. Then his father comes in and tells him to stop listening to his grandfather about the treasure nonsense. His father's name is Patrick and he has been looking for the treasure for years but he has never found it. Then the movie shifts to the Artic to the present where Ben, now and adult, is looking for Charlotte. This movie is great.

Maybe i was yawning.  I kept waiting for the movie to justify his presence, it never did.  I kept waiting for him to say one funny thing or to change his expression in the slightest.  Neither occurred.  I usually like this type of Walter Brennan part, but this guy turns me off.  He is like a Tom Green without the charisma.Outside of that, the movie was good.  Many will enjoy it, although on the showing I went to, there were no children.  Do children really enjoy a movie that has no children in it?  If it was me making the film, I would have had Nicolas Cage had a little boy or girl who could have hung around instead of that awful Justin Bartha.  Does Bartha have compromising photographs of Jerry Bruckheimer or what?  Anyhow Nic is looking pretty grim nowadays, you can't believe it when Diane Kruger startss looking at him romantically.  He's a good actor though, and Jon Voight is awfully good playing his dad.  Christopher Plummer looks as though he were cryogenically preserved.  He is so old I thought he was Max Von Sydow and that they would find his body guarding the treasure trove like a mummy.  Kruger is fantastically beautiful and she will remind viewers with long memories of the German actress Marthe Keller who starred with Al Pacino in the great race car picture BOBBY DEERFIELD.  She made the movie fun, she got into the spirit and delivered a farcical performance very different from the labored one she gave up as Helen in the recent TROY movie.Many have asked, does this movie make sense?  Why do they show Harvey Keitel with that ring on?  Was that supposed to trigger one of those ""a-ha"" moments that explain everything?  If so, it didn't.

For those who wish to avoid foul language, this film features one foul word and several uses of the Lord's name in vain.Overall, the film gets four stars because, although it is a fun way to spend an evening, it is not something that will touch you, educated you, motivated you, or in any way leave a lasting impression on you.",4,Pretty Good Way to Spend an Evening,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1895,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'movie', 'renter', 'let', 'alone', 'theater', 'go-er', 'insisted', 'husband', 'rent', 'movie', 'brother', 'Ask', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'see', 'always', 'asked', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'so', 'now', 'around', 'asking', 'people', 'liked', 'latest', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', ""'m"", 'picky', 'movies', 'often', 'start', 'playing', 'computer', 'middle', 'rental', 'one', 'managed', 'pull', 'keep', 'watching', 'end.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'one', 'classics', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'buy', 'was', 'worth', 'cost', 'rental', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'was', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'now', 'few', 'movies', 'leave', 'sort', 'impression', 'do', 'remember', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'watching', 'it.If', 'are', 'looking', 'be', 'awed', 'amazed', 'moved', 'depth', 'emotion', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'watch', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'feel', 'going', 'out', 'just', 'want', 'relax', 'will', 'take', 'somewhere', 'else', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'movie.Also', 'parents', 'really', 'offensive', 'content', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'lot', 'other', 'available', 'Hollywood', 'offerings', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'child', '12', 'older', 'watching', 'are', 'very', 'strict', 'what', 'let', 'children', 'watch', 'attempting', 'avoid', 's*xual', 'content', 'film', 'kiss', 'attempting', 'avoid', 'violence', 'film', 'falling', 'deaths', 'non-lethal', 'violence', 'who', 'wish', 'avoid', 'foul', 'language', 'film', 'one', 'foul', 'word', 'several', 'uses', 'Lord', 'name', 'vain.Overall', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'because', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'touch', 'educated', 'motivated', 'way', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression']",National Treasure

National Treasure is such a film, which intends to trigger suspense while providing a fantastic adventure through the mysterious freemasons, history, and the founding fathers.  The audience which sits down to enjoy this venture undertaken by Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his partner Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) will unfortunately have placed it's foot in the wrong adventure, as this concoction will neither be suspenseful nor adventurous.  Instead, the viewer will go through a repetitive journey of clue solving where the story's hero seems to be a know-it-all, whereas previous generations seem to have been struggling through their lifetime with what he finds to be simple.When Ben was a young teen, he heard from his grandfather (Christopher Plummer) about a fantastic adventure regarding a hidden treasure uncovered by some knights during the crusades.  This treasure was deemed too vast and rich for any king, or person, which caused people to hide it in the first place.  When the Templar Knights found it under the Temple of Solomon, they swore to hide and protect the treasure.  The knights brought the treasure to Europe, and later to the New World.  This brief introduction to the treasure serves the purpose of explaining Ben's obsession with the treasure, but it is also the best part of the film that regrettably dwindles hereafter.For the rest of the film the audience gets to follow the camera while it moves with Ben who travels between different historical sites on the quest for another clue of the treasures whereabouts.  This turns into a rather tiresome event, as the story seems to cover it up with grand larceny and mean thugs that are not so mean.  Additional awkwardness generates from the lack of suspense, as everything, even the difficult parts of the film, seem to move smoothly.  The film also provides a sense of comfort and ease, which does not belong in the atmosphere with lethal crooks and the FBI breathing down their necks.The director Jon Turteltaub's creation is a cheesy adventure film that fails to compare to many other treasure hunt films such as It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), Goonies (1985), and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003).  Some level of cheesiness is to be expected, but National Treasure does not try to venture in that direction intentionally and instead leaves the viewers feeling somewhat cheated in the end.  This is mostly  because the protagonist in the film knows it all, and delivers methodically an answer to all questions.  The roller coaster that the film offers is without the steep hills that parents safely can send their children through while most children will enjoy this film before they learn that film can be so much more.",2,A Roller Coaster Without Steep Hills...,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,2841,"['Treasure', 'hunting', 'intriguing', 'notion', 'often', 'connected', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'when', 'viewed', 'film', 'National', 'Treasure', 'such', 'film', 'trigger', 'suspense', 'providing', 'fantastic', 'adventure', 'mysterious', 'freemasons', 'history', 'founding', 'fathers', 'audience', 'down', 'enjoy', 'venture', 'undertaken', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'partner', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'will', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'placed', 'foot', 'wrong', 'adventure', 'concoction', 'will', 'neither', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'adventurous', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'will', 'go', 'repetitive', 'journey', 'clue', 'solving', 'where', 'story', 'hero', 'be', 'know-it-all', 'whereas', 'previous', 'generations', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'struggling', 'lifetime', 'what', 'be', 'simple.When', 'Ben', 'was', 'young', 'teen', 'heard', 'grandfather', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'fantastic', 'adventure', 'regarding', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'uncovered', 'knights', 'crusades', 'treasure', 'was', 'deemed', 'too', 'vast', 'rich', 'king', 'person', 'caused', 'people', 'hide', 'first', 'place', 'When', 'Templar', 'Knights', 'found', 'Temple', 'Solomon', 'swore', 'hide', 'protect', 'treasure', 'knights', 'brought', 'treasure', 'Europe', 'later', 'New', 'World', 'brief', 'introduction', 'treasure', 'purpose', 'explaining', 'Ben', 'obsession', 'treasure', 'also', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'regrettably', 'hereafter.For', 'rest', 'film', 'audience', 'follow', 'camera', 'Ben', 'who', 'travels', 'different', 'historical', 'sites', 'quest', 'clue', 'treasures', 'whereabouts', 'rather', 'tiresome', 'event', 'story', 'cover', 'up', 'grand', 'larceny', 'mean', 'thugs', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'mean', 'Additional', 'awkwardness', 'generates', 'lack', 'suspense', 'everything', 'even', 'difficult', 'parts', 'film', 'seem', 'move', 'smoothly', 'film', 'also', 'sense', 'comfort', 'ease', 'not', 'belong', 'atmosphere', 'lethal', 'crooks', 'FBI', 'breathing', 'down', 'necks.The', 'director', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'creation', 'cheesy', 'adventure', 'film', 'compare', 'many', 'other', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'films', 'such', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', '1963', 'Goonies', '1985', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', '2003', 'level', 'cheesiness', 'be', 'expected', 'National', 'Treasure', 'not', 'try', 'venture', 'direction', 'intentionally', 'instead', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'cheated', 'end', 'mostly', 'protagonist', 'film', 'delivers', 'methodically', 'answer', 'questions', 'roller', 'coaster', 'film', 'offers', 'steep', 'hills', 'parents', 'safely', 'can', 'send', 'children', 'most', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'learn', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more']",National Treasure

There would only be one day out of the year where a shadow at 2:20pm would point to exactly the right place.When the characters come to a cave, they pick up torches that have been lying around for 200 years, and they still work!There is no depth to any of the characters in this movie.  They are all cardboard cutouts doing what is needed to keep the story moving.

The intelligent and ambitious vehicle has not gone on to as much success as Pirates. Nevertheless, National Treasure is ideal for tweens interested in a thinking person's movie.Acclaimed film veteran Christopher Plummer opens the tale, telling his young grandson Ben Gates how their family holds a vital clue in finding a vast treasure brought to the New World by the Knights Templar and protected by Free Masons from the British. Hidden and since lost from memory, Ben (Nicholas Cage) spends his adult life searching for the treasure, despite his father's (Jon Voight) bitter realization that the treasure is no more than a myth. After the discovery of a ship buried in the Artic Circle, Ben realizes the next clue found there suggests the treasure map is on the back of the Declaration of Independence.To stop his former business partner Ian Howe (Sean Bean) from stealing and destroying the Declaration, Ben and his understudy Riley steal the Declaration first. After interfering with their plans, historian Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) insists on coming along to ensure the protection of the invaluable document. With Ian and FBI investigator (Harvey Kietel) on their trail, the trio travels from Washington to Philadelphia and New York, gathering clues and searching for the treasure.The premise of National Treasure is more intelligent that most, but it is ambitious and not fully executed. Trying to ride the Da Vinci Code tail, National Treasure resorts to basic exposition on American history with some fantastical turns tossed in along the way. The script is too broad and witty in the wrong places. Intellectual teens or history fans will no doubt dig Treasure, but for smarter adults, the movie doesn't hold many repeat viewings. The first time around, the Declaration heist, Philadelphia chase, and New York underground escape only go so far, and eventually, plot holes take center stage.Often shown on broadcast and basic cable channels, National Treasure is only worth a second or third view for the cast. Justin Bartha as Riley has most of the amusing moments as the sarcastic sidekick. His deadpan style is offbeat and more refreshing than if the role was set up with a blatant laugh track. Likewise, Nicholas Cage is clearly having fun with the role. The Oscar winner and action star surely has his pick of material, so after dark pictures like his award winning turn in Leaving Las Vegas, and more recently Snake Eyes and 8mm, Cage delivers his historical wit with a lighthearted manner his fans will no doubt enjoy. Relative newcomer Diane Krueger (Troy) fits the bill as Doctor Chase.All the secondary characters are under written and not properly showcased- the talented actors behind them do as much as they can within the script. Krueger is the pretty but brainy and clearly attracted to Ben, and Harvey Keital (Pulp Fiction) is the scary FBI agent who really isn't all that scary and in fact helpful stereotype. Villain veteran Sean Bean (Patriot Games, Goldeneye, Don't Say A Word) suffers greatly as the clich&eacute;d European unobstructed bad guy bent on acquiring the treasure simply because he can. Bean's sublte threats on Riley's sidekick are some of the better played scenes in the film.Whether he was made up to look older or was unwell during filming, Jon Voight does not look well as Patrick Gates. Although the relationship between the father and son is a big part of National Treasure, the script does little to add to the oft-told scenario. Voight seems tired as the Old Dad-perhaps that is his award winning acting range, but for someone who was also once a respected Historian, Dad's left with clich&eacute;d phrases and glib remarks. The only thing I found rewarding in the Voight and Cage duo is that Cage was in Gone in Sixty Seconds with Voight's real life daughter Angelina Jolie and they, of course, aren't speaking to each other.The scope of National Treasure is also a bit presumptuous for someone who has grown up in the areas in which the film takes place. Although the Declaration heist is very vague and undefined in most places, it also gives away real facts and science. Would the powers that be really let a movie show how to steal the Declaration of Independence? Likewise, the Philadelphia locales are taken somewhat out of context. The elaborate double chase through Philadelphia takes the audience on a course that isn't actually possible through the city. One notices these things after multiple viewings, but younger audiences will take the substitution of story for van chases and death defying avalanches, which in the end, was probably Disney's intention.Yes, I've been harsh on National Treasure, and I don't expect you to see it ten times like I have, but I expected more from a big vehicle backed with a lot of money and starring Nicholas Cage and Sean Bean. Female fans will most definitely watch for them, but National Treasure is more for young conspiracy fans interested on loose coincidences and facts about Benjamin Franklin. History teachers might benefit from a viewing followed by a fact or fiction discussion and trip to Philadelphia, but I don't think that's what Disney had in mind when they launched their massive contests and treasure chances with the film's box office release.National Treasure is available on DVD with some fun extras for the kids, and the film has been popular enough to warrant a sequel. National Treasure: Book of Secrets is currently filming. Focusing on the mysterious surrounding The Lincoln assassination, I don't see how it could top the original if it tries to stretch its tiny premise against the original's well, national attempts.More intelligent than The Mummy, and most definitely better than The Scorpion King, National Treasure is the young man's Indiana Jones.",3,neat for kids,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,5894,"['Capitalizing',

It's Disney/Bruckheimer, which portends the level of gloss; strange to see Disney working with JB, well-known in Hollywood for savagely beating his many high-priced call girls. But you don't have to have morals to sell morality, fortunately for most of that town, and this flick subtly pushes all sorts of mythology while simultaneously mocking what it purports to celebrate.Trevor Rabin's score has some fine moments, and nothing is exceptionally poor here, but then nothing is exceptionally fine either, except perhaps the set design, which has some highlights. Cage is typically good but not great, though Voight and Plummer do add some gravitas to the proceedings. There are many egregious continuity issues with the script's factual details, but hey, don't look too closely at the man behind the curtain...NT is predictably manipulative, with the music telling us what to feel if the script doesn't do it well enough, and if you're looking for vaguely exciting Saturday night mindnumbing, this could pass. All in all, good fun for those who like to believe that the Masonic and Templar theories etc have no truth to them and that all in American history is as we read in the history books.

From the director of Pirates of the Caribbean comes another adventure of epic proportions.Meet Ben Franklin Gates, an ecentric ""treasure protector"" on the quest to find the treasure of the Free Masons, supposedly the treasure of all treasures.  Taking on the tradition of six generations, Gates squares off against burning boats in the artic, a restless FBI task force, a ruthless thief, a yelling archivist and plenty of skepticism in the academic community.  Teamed up with the nerdy, feeling left out sidekick Riley, they go quickly from clue to clue trying to find the treasure, but even they get skeptical as to whether the treasure is real or just a legend to fool the British during the American Revolution.Despite many historical inaccuracies to make the history tie into the movie, it is still a history lesson about the founding fathers and does bring out the American spirit while watching.  I remember emerging from the theatre, wanting to go on my own adventure again just like when I was in elementary school.  The action is pretty good, but not too violent, in fact it's hardly violent at all.  It also has no profanity so all ages can watch it.The DVD features arn't bad at all.  Buena Vista tried a concept I've never seen before; it's called multilevel treasure hunt, where the more you watch in the special features, the more clues you get to access more special features.  It was cool at first and took me one try to figure out the puzzle.I watched the alternate ending and I'm glad they kept the ending that's actually in the movie, the trimming was well done after seeing the deleted scenes.  The animatic opening had some interesting parts about the Templars that were actually more intriguing and historically accurate than the movie itself, so they could've done some work there.Overall, with the historical inaccuracies, I'd give National Treasure a 4.5.  Defintely worth getting when it comes out on May 3rd with the cool special features.",5,It's About Time We Had Another Adventure!,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2184,"['Even', 'days', 'Adventure', 'genre', 'been', 'slow', 'somewhat', 'lately', 'taken', 'over', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'action', 'military', 'films', 'great', 'adventure', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'make', 'feel', 'energized', 'end', 'director', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'adventure', 'epic', 'proportions.Meet', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'ecentric', 'treasure', 'protector', 'quest', 'find', 'treasure', 'Free', 'Masons', 'supposedly', 'treasure', 'treasures', 'Taking', 'tradition', 'six', 'generations', 'Gates', 'off', 'burning', 'boats', 'artic', 'restless', 'FBI', 'task', 'force', 'ruthless', 'thief', 'yelling', 'archivist', 'plenty', 'skepticism', 'academic', 'community', 'Teamed', 'up', 'nerdy', 'feeling', 'left', 'out', 'sidekick', 'Riley', 'go', 'quickly', 'clue', 'clue', 'trying', 'find', 'treasure', 'even', 'get', 'skeptical', 'treasure', 'real', 'just', 'legend', 'fool', 'British', 'American', 'Revolution.Despite', 'many', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'make', 'history', 'tie', 'movie', 'still', 'history', 'lesson', 'founding', 'fathers', 'bring', 'out', 'American', 'spirit', 'watching', 'remember', 'emerging', 'theatre', 'wanting', 'go', 'own', 'adventure', 'again', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'elementary', 'school', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'fact', 'hardly', 'violent', 'also', 'profanity', 'so', 'ages', 'can', 'watch', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'ar', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'tried', 'concept', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'called', 'multilevel', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'where', 'more', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'more', 'clues', 'get', 'access', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'cool', 'first', 'took', 'one', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'puzzle.I', 'watched', 'alternate', 'ending', ""'m"", 'glad', 'kept', 'ending', 'actually', 'movie', 'trimming', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'seeing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'animatic', 'opening', 'had', 'interesting', 'parts', 'Templars', 'were', 'actually', 'more', 'intriguing', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'work', 'there.Overall', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', ""'d"", 'give', 'National', 'Treasure', '4.5', 'Defintely', 'worth', 'getting', 'when', 'out', 'May', '3rd', 'cool', 'special', 'features']",National Treasure

From the time he was only a child, he has had a desire to find this fabled treasure --- the treasure of ALL treasures, the largest one in history --- and has only had one clue to go on: a slip of paper given to his great-great-great-great grandfather that says ""The secret lies with Charlotte.""When he finally solves this clue, it leads to another clue, and another and another, and so on.  The first clue points to the Declaraion of Independence.  But when he refuses his partner's suggestion that they steal the ancient document, his team breaks up to go in different directions to solve this mystery.Knowing that Ian, his ex-partner, plans to steal the Declaration --- and knowing that Ian has no real respect for that piece of history and only wants the treasure for himself --- Gates decides that he has to steal the Declaration of Independence himself in order to protect it.With the help of his remaining partner, Riley, and the lovely Dr. Chase --- an expert on the Declaration and on the handling of antique documents --- Gates follows a twisting path laid down by the free masons, trying to put together the pieces of this massive puzzle.Filled with adventure and lots of good clean humor, this movie is fun for all ages.

627131,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JN5E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Here is your first clue:  &quot;National Treasure&quot; is to &quot;(fill in the blank)&quot; as &quot;Jezebel&quot; is to &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;While the millions of book readers wondering who was going to play Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) in Ron Howard's next movie did not approach the passionate debate over who should play Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, there is no doubt that &quot;National Treasure&quot; is an attempt to capitalize on the great interest in a best-selling novel about unraveling arcane clues left by famous people in the same way that &quot;Jezebel&quot; got to the silver screen with a movie about the ante-bellum South before &quot;GWTW.&quot;  The question is whether &quot;National Treasure&quot; is just an appetizer to whet our appetite for next year's version of Dan Brown's novel or if this will turn our stomach to the whole idea of films where only the hero can decipher the clues and solve the mystery.The key is not to take this film seriously because it does not.  After all, there is not a secret society that is dodging the steps of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage), but a villain, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who wants the treasure because it is worth billions of dollars.  Yes, there is a pretty blonde with a foreign accent (Diane Kruger) to provide informative, help and a love interest for the hero, but there is also a nerd (Justin Bartha) for comic relief and hard science.  Ultimately, &quot;National Treasure&quot; is more like an adventure computer game, where you around a collect strange objects and visit interesting places while solving puzzles that eventually get you to whatever you are looking for, which suggests that a younger audience that does not often get away from their computer screens long enough to read an actual novel will enjoy this film more.Gates is the latest in a line of family members named for the Founding Fathers and committed to the search for a fabled ancient treasure originally discovered under King Solomon's Temple moved from Jerusalem by the Knights Templar and brought by Free Masons to the New World where it was secreted away by those same Founding Fathers.  Having discovered the meaning of the first clue given to him by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer), Ben Gates figures that the next is found on the back of the Declaration of Independence, written in invisible ink.  Gates knows this, Howe knows this, and the race is on to beg, borrow or steal the most important piece of parchment in the United States and figure out the next clue in the puzzle.On the plus side the film can be seen, as one kid observes in the alternative ending, as an attempt to make the viewers learn something about American history, which is a laudable if secondary goal in and of itself.  But basically this is a caper film, which means you do not have to try and figure out the clues because the screenplay gives Gates just enough time to figure it out while the rest of us try to follow along.  Otherwise, what this 2004 film from director Jon Turteltaub (&quot;Phenomenon,&quot; &quot;Instinct&quot;) says to us is that the Founding Fathers must not have cared as much about establishing a new nation if they sat on all that money instead of using it to buy weapons to gain independence or pay the soldiers in the Continental Army who were freezing to death at Valley Forge.  Of course, then there would be no treasure to hunt in this movie.They always said that if Ben Franklin had written the Declaration of Independence rather than Thomas Jefferson he would have put a joke in it, so perhaps it is not surprising that he is the merry prankster behind a lot of the code breaking and puzzle solving in this film.  Fortunately the codes and puzzles on the DVD special features that get you to bonus sections and the trivia track for the film are a lot easier to solve.  Why the treasure is lost makes no sense since the colonists did win the American Revolution and the signers of the Declaration were not slaughtered like the Knights Templar.  So the desperate situation told reached in the story Gates is told by his grandfather would not have been reached.

627138,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00005JN5E,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[26, 31]","It seems that just about every movie out there in modern times involves skimpy outfits, swearing, or other adult themes. National Treasure is one of those rare films that is fun for the kids, while offering at least a reasonable amount of intrigue for adults as well.First, yes, let's get out of the way that the plot and characters are rather one-dimensional and only lightly sketched. Ben wants the treasure - but we never really get a sense of why he's seeking it. Perhaps he wants to find it (as he claims when seeking to avoid prison) to 'give it back to the people'. He's joined by a cute female researcher and a cyber-guy. The trio is up against Sean Bean, who wants the treasure for (gasp) monetary gain.The main appeal of the movie is that the sanitized adventure takes place in locations that you could visit with your family - Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York. The characters move from location to location, deciphering clues and getting hints of masonic involvement. There are creaky underground caverns, guttering torches, and of course, vast treasures. It helps kids to get interested in history, which is a lovely thing.There is ""sweet"" love between the main characters - one mild kiss is the extent of their affection. There is the child-reedeeming-his-father's-love going on. Without giving much away, good triumphs and evil is vanquished.I really wish they could have done a bit better job on the coherency of the movie, though. Sure, having it so sweet-and-simple was lovely for the kids. However, they could have had a bit more logic in some scenes. They know that one clue is ""beneath"" a two-word name ... but when they find a plaque with those two words on it, they immediately smash it. When they find that person's body, they immediately cause destruction to the scene, so they can't search it. There's a sundial-type puzzle in one sequence, and they obviously need to know the time of day for the sundial. The puzzle is in three dimensions - they need to know exactly where the sundial points. However, they don't even think at all about what day of the year it should refer to - they simply assume one day is the same as any other.They use ropes that are over 200 years old, which somehow haven't been gnawed by rats or crisped over time. And, in a scene of ultimate horror for me, they find a room full of ancient documents - and they LIGHT A MASSIVE FIRE. Not only would this have crisped the important papers, but this was in an underground chamber - the smoke and lack of oxygen would have slain them all.I'm not trying to nit-pick here - there were trillions of little errors if we wanted to get into those. These were the huge, glaring ""No Way!"" moments that caused huge problems with simply following and enjoying the movie. It would have been so easy for the writers to handle these points properly - to keep it 'sweet' for the kids and 'fun' for the adults. So I find it a shame that they couldn't do that properly.For the DVD, there were a number of special features provided. They definitely aimed this squarely at kids. There are a tiny amount of deleted scenes and alternate ending options. The main group of special features are 'learn about codes' types of exercises. They take quite a while to work your way through - not because they are hard, but because they are really tedious. You have to solve a number of symbol-matching puzzles. You have to go letter, by letter, using your remote control to find the matches. In one puzzle, even though there are multiple copies of a given symbol on the screen, you have to go back and re-select it each time. That's just silly.But still, it is meant for kids, and the kids might enjoy doing it step ... by step ... by step ... to get all the secret codes to unlock the super-secret features. There is a tiny amount of information about the Masons, and how the purge of the Templars over 700 years ago still affects us in our fear of Friday the 13th. I would have enjoyed even more ""real"" information about the Great Seal on dollar bills and so on. There are many topics touched on by the movie which are just let go. Maybe the hope is that people will use the internet to keep figuring out secrets, long after they finish with the movie.So in summary, if you have kids in the house, then National Treasure is a great, safe movie to watch together that is a fun story that has a nice moral ending. If you're an adult, I might rent it - but there are many other books out there that cover this topic area (masonic secrets, history of 1776 situation, Templars, etc.) with much more interesting detail. The reality of what went on is even more fascinating than anything Hollywood could invent!",4,Great adventure film appropriate for youngsters,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,4679,"['just', 'movie', 'there', 'modern', 'times', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'swearing', 'other', 'adult', 'themes', 'National', 'Treasure', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'fun', 'kids', 'offering', 'least', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'intrigue', 'adults', 'well.First', 'yes', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'only', 'lightly', 'sketched', 'Ben', 'treasure', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'why', 'seeking', 'Perhaps', 'find', 'when', 'seeking', 'avoid', 'prison', ""'give"", 'back', 'people', 'joined', 'cute', 'female', 'researcher', 'cyber-guy', 'trio', 'up', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'treasure', 'gasp', 'monetary', 'gain.The', 'main', 'appeal', 'movie', 'sanitized', 'adventure', 'place', 'locations', 'could', 'visit', 'family', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Philadelphia', 'New', 'York', 'characters', 'move', 'location', 'location', 'deciphering', 'clues', 'getting', 'hints', 'masonic', 'involvement', 'are', 'creaky', 'underground', 'caverns', 'guttering', 'torches', 'course', 'vast', 'treasures', 'kids', 'get', 'interested', 'history', 'lovely', 'sweet', 'love', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'mild', 'kiss', 'extent', 'affection', ""child-reedeeming-his-father's-love"", 'going', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'good', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'vanquished.I', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'job', 'coherency', 'movie', 'though', 'Sure', 'having', 'so', 'sweet-and-simple', 'was', 'lovely', 'kids', 'However', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'logic', 'scenes', 'know', 'one', 'clue', 'beneath', 'two-word', 'name', 'when', 'find', 'plaque', 'two', 'words', 'immediately', 'smash', 'When', 'find', 'person', 'body', 'immediately', 'cause', 'destruction', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'search', 'sundial-type', 'puzzle', 'one', 'sequence', 'obviously', 'need', 'know', 'time', 'day', 'sundial', 'puzzle', 'three', 'dimensions', 'need', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'sundial', 'points', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'what', 'day', 'year', 'should', 'refer', 'simply', 'assume', 'one', 'day', 'same', 'other.They', 'use', 'ropes', 'are', '200', 'years', 'old', 'somehow', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'gnawed', 'rats', 'crisped', 'time', 'scene', 'ultimate', 'horror', 'find', 'room', 'full', 'ancient', 'documents', 'LIGHT', 'MASSIVE', 'FIRE', 'Not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'crisped', 'important', 'papers', 'was', 'underground', 'chamber', 'smoke', 'lack', 'oxygen', 'would', 'have', 'slain', 'all.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'nit-pick', 'here', 'were', 'trillions', 'little', 'errors', 'wanted', 'get', 'were', 'huge', 'glaring', 'Way', 'moments', 'caused', 'huge', 'problems', 'simply', 'following', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'writers', 'handle', 'points', 'properly', 'keep', ""'sweet"", 'kids', ""'fun"", 'adults', 'So', 'find', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'properly.For', 'DVD', 'were', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'provided', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'squarely', 'kids', 'are', 'tiny', 'amount', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'options', 'main', 'group', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""'learn"", 'codes', 'types', 'exercises', 'take', 'while', 'work', 'way', 'not', 'are', 'hard', 'are', 'really', 'tedious', 'have', 'solve', 'number', 'symbol-matching', 'puzzles', 'have', 'go', 'letter', 'letter', 'using', 'remote', 'control', 'find', 'matches', 'one', 'puzzle', 'even', 'are', 'multiple', 'copies', 'given', 'symbol', 'screen', 'have', 'go', 'back', 're-select', 'time', 'just', 'silly.But', 'still', 'meant', 'kids', 'kids', 'might', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'step', 'step', 'step', 'get', 'secret', 'codes', 'unlock', 'super-secret', 'features', 'tiny', 'amount', 'information', 'Masons', 'how', 'purge', 'Templars', '700', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'fear', 'Friday', '13th', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'real', 'information', 'Great', 'Seal', 'dollar', 'bills', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'topics', 'touched', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'Maybe', 'hope', 'people', 'will', 'use', 'internet', 'keep', 'figuring', 'out', 'secrets', 'long', 'finish', 'movie.So', 'summary', 'have', 'kids', 'house', 'then', 'National', 'Treasure', 'great', 'safe', 'movie', 'watch', 'together', 'fun', 'story', 'nice', 'moral', 'ending', ""'re"", 'adult', 'might', 'rent', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'books', 'there', 'cover', 'topic', 'area', 'masonic', 'secrets', 'history', '1776', 'situation', 'Templars', 'etc', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'detail', 'reality', 'what', 'went', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'invent']",National Treasure

Nicholas Cage's true talents are wasted here.  Don't get me wrong; he does play ""kooky researcher"" well: it's just that it was a no-brainer for him, and something an unknown actor could have done to get some exposure.There is more famous male talent, with John Voigt playing Ben's father, and Sean Bean as Ben's treasure hunter rival Ian Howe.  (No, that is not Rutger Hauer, that is Sean Bean).Blond bimbo Diane Kruger plays nerdy archivist Abigail Chase, who happens to look like she walked out of a modeling agency.  As much time as she spends in museum basments, obsessing over dusty archives, that must also make you spend hours getting ready in the morning.  Of course Ben and she fall in . . . oh, barf, it's so predictable.The movie is a fun sort of American History scavenger hunt through Philadelphia, where our heroes look for clues left by Ben Franklin to find the supposed treasure collected by the Knights Templar and managed by the Stonemasons.  Watching the movie, you feel as if you are being tricked into watching an educational film, as Ben spouts historical trivia while running from Howe.Justin Bartha is a good actor, but his role as basically eunuch sidekick to Cage is embarrassing to watch.

We get so serious about historical accuracy, religious beliefs, and countless other vagaries, that we forget that we don't always have to be judge and jury.  Yes, this is a confection, borrowed wholesale from Dan Brown's novels as well as a whole heap of Illuminati/Templar/Mason tales.  No, it is not a stunning example is great film making.  But that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it.Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage) is heir to a family of historians and archeologists.  His grandfather has taught him that they are keepers of a great secret - the first clue to the location of a great treasure, collected by Templars, Masons, and Illuminati over the centuries.  Originally hidden in Europe, it was transferred to our continent even as we started the wobbly road to becoming a nation and hidden carefully behind a maze of clues.  Gates is a man possessed.  With his assistant Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and the help of master thief Ian Howe (Sean Bean), he solves the first clue.  The map to the treasure is hidden on the back of a well-known document - The Declaration of Independence.Abandoned by Howe, Gates and Riley make their way back to civilization.  After several efforts to alert authorities, the pair realized that the only was to save the Declaration of Independence from being stolen was to steal it themselves.  So the first part of the film is an outrageous theft counter theft story in which not one, but two groups of thieves attempt the impossible.  Gates succeeds by the skin of his teeth and, in the process, drafts Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), the Declaration's keeper as a not quite willing accomplice.What follows is a combination a high-speed chase and a history lesson as Howe pursues Gates and the FBI pursues everyone.  The film overplays its hand a bit, but manages to stay on the light story of this story of thieves and ladders.  While the story is predictable, it has all the mysteries and cliffhangers you might want.  And you have the bonus of visits to the other side of several famous monuments to the founding of the United States.  The history lessons alone are worth the price of admission.The humorous dialog, lack of violence and bloodshed, and exciting action make this the perfect vehicle for displaying some interesting facts about our forefathers.

The Gates family has been searching for a treasure hidden by the founders of the United States since the last founder told one of them the first clue many years ago.  There's just one difference.  Ben has solved the first riddle and that leads him to believe the next clue is on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  When his financiers decided to steal the document, Ben realizes he's on his own to find the treasure and keep America's historical document safe.  But in a race again time, will Ben and his friends win?Ok, so maybe this movie isn't great cinema or the best movie ever made.  It really doesn't matter, and you know why?  Because the movie is fun.  I had a smile on my face from start to finish and was often on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next.  Yes, I'm annoyed that we never found out how Ben tracked down the first clue.  And there's at least one plot hole that will jump off the screen at you.  But in the end, I didn't care.  The story engaged me, and the characters were fun.  I found their banter very entertaining.  Plus setting the story around so much American history certainly didn't hurt this US history buff.The DVD could have been better done.  The widescreen and surround sound are wonderful.  It's the extras where I have my problem.  There is a treasure hunt motif to them, with at least two different levels.  The booklet does provide clues to get to the second layer, but I keep hearing rumors of a final level, and that's very annoying.  What is easily found is nice.  There are two deleted scenes and an alternate ending, each with an optional commentary.  We get a brief behind the filming documentary and an animated early version of the opening story to give the director an idea how it was supposed to look.  Layer two brings an encryption game and two brief documentaries on real life treasure hunters (interesting) and the Knights Templar (mostly useless.)

627160,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JN5E,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[11, 12]","One of the first things taught at journalism schools is that most ""news stories"" are to be written at a 6th grade level of education - the editorial page is the place for more erudite discussion.  National Treasure is written at a level that would make the ""average"" person think ""hey, that's pretty clever!"", keeping in mind that the ""average"" person might not know that Benjamin Franklin wrote anonymous letters to newspapers while a teenager under the name ""Silence Dogood"". (He wrote hundreds of OTHER letters under other fictitious names as well and, given the piddling state of education in the U.S. I'd guess that the ""average"" person doesn't know that Old Ben was also ""Poor Richard"" or even know what his almanac was all about.) But I digress. Some people love to trash things that they think aren't up to their level, and so ""National Treasure"" didn't receive stellar reviews from the professional critics. I think it's safe to say the movie wasn't made for professional critics.It's an entertaining little adventure and anyone who claims that it has no clever parts must be very clever indeed.  Much of the movie is a historical scavenger hunt that the founding fathers have laid out for the person who can decipher the clues - with the treasure of the Templar Knights at the end of the rainbow.  One of the first clues is carved into the stem of a meerschaum pipe. The stem of the pipe detaches from the carved bowl, and  has raised etchings.  Our hero figures out that these etchings are intended to be used like an ink stamp, so he pricks his finger to use his blood as ink and rolls the pipe stem out to reveal the next clue.  I thought that was pretty clever.The hero, Benjamin Franklin Gates, is the Grandson of John Adams Gates, and the Gates have been thought of as the mad scientists of American History because every generation has handed down the story of the hidden treasure and spends decades of their life trying to find the treasure, or at least get other historians to take them seriously.  The plot takes them to Washington (to steal the Declaration of Independence in a concise little caper that's at least as clever as the one in ""After the Sunset"", and THAT was SUPPOSED to be a ""caper"" movie.) Ben has an assistant named Riley who serves two purposes: to add clever little comments like ""so who wants to go down the creepy tunnel first?"" and to provide someone that Ben can give exposition to: such as who Silence Dogood was.  Diane Kruger is the love interest - a Washington Ph.D. who works at the National Archives.  She's the pretty face used to represent all the keepers of the Declaration of Independence.  Sean Bean is a rival treasure hunter and the movie goes to great lengths to show that Heroic Ben is only after the treasure for it's historical significance while Bean's Ian is only out for the money.

627162,AXLXU4LMIRO3F,B00005JN5E,MartialWay,"[1, 7]","Hahaha... Do you know why I'm laughing? I'm laughing at the morons who gave this fun action/adventure film a low mark based on its predecessors. When people are so full of negativity that they have to slam anything over anything it makes me laugh, because no one is listening and they're only hurting themselves. That's funny to me.People online LOVE to think they are so smart, love to think that they've caught a new film ""stealing"" from another: You say ""Galdiator"", and they say its a theft of ""Sparticus"", you say ""The Matrix"" and they say ""Tron""--- this can go on and on---and they just *have to* come to Amazon and rage... cause what else have they got to do, right? You've all cheated yourselves out of a good time with your opinionated, self importance--- including professional reviewers who make a living on their asses watching film after film until they are so jaded that it isn't in them to dismiss certain flaws in favor of the experience. This is a movie that one should sit back and enjoy, and not split hairs over. Does anybody go to movies to enjoy them anymore?I laugh that because a film is made in the tradition of the Action Adventure genre, it is therefore a theft to the kiddies on Amazon, who are only outcasts that are slammed by life everyday. The cool kids dismiss them, the jocks beat them up, the girls won't look at them to spit, they can't get a date to go anywhere with them, and the furthest they travel is to the movie theaters, or the comic book stores where they gather in a bitter-geek gaggle, and decide which films are rip offs of other films.They've seem em all--- repeatedly--- and they know! Hollywood can't fool them! So they go to movies looking for things to complain about, and Amazon has given them a way to share their bitterness with a community that couldn't care less if you paid them to. It's so sad; so very, very sad. I suppose I should give them credit for not picking up a gun and laying waste to their classmates and teachers while blasting Thrill Kill Kult into their headphones.Did ""Raiders"" inspire this tale? I'm sure it did. Is National Treasure derivative of the Indiana Jones films? Sure. Did they rip off the Davinci Code?"" No. It's inspired by these things to be sure. And only a fool would deny the money angle, but does that make National Treasure a theft? I think not. There is nothing brand new under the sun, but I saw enough originality to believe National Treasure to be inspired, and somewhat derivative of those films, and though I think ""The dollar bill is trying to tell me something"", is a pretty hackneyed line; I saw no attempt at theft.So many people here have said National Treasure is trying to ""cash in on Raiders"". I was eight years old when Raiders of the Lost Ark first came to theaters! Today I am thirty-one! What took them so long to decide to cash in? Why did they wait twenty-four years to start ripping off Raiders?I must have been at the wrong theater. I didn't see any lines, plot points or characters that resembled those classics in any way. I guess I was too busy having fun to see it. Or maybe like many of us I don't sit around watching the ""Indy Trilogy"" over, and over till I know each line. I have places to be and I pay for movies to be entertained, not so I can outwit Hollywood.From where I'm sitting, this is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no foul language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it.The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow.Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure.I'd be giving National Treasure 3  stars, but Amazon doesn't allow it, so I'm giving it 4, just to anger the haters and amuse myself. To put it simply, National Treasure *will* remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy, Mission Impossible, Sneakers, and ""Ocean's 11"". Note I did not accuse it of stealing from any of these. You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it.No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark of the Covenant either. It's a fun, fantasy, ""what-if"" kind of movie.

This was the first adventure/treasure hunting movie that I have seen that was based in the United States, which was quite refresshing.The plot of the movie is that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there is a map to an a treasure trove.  Nicolas Cage's character and his group of friends are trying to seal the Declaration of Independence to prevent the ""bad guys"" from getting it and the treasure.  Along the way, the group encounters numerous other clues that further lead them to the treasure.This movie is a typical, fun adventure story; an action film without all the blood and violence that has become too common these days.  I would say that this movie takes its cues from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (one of my favorite movies of all time).  There is the father/son relationship between Cage and Voit, the intelligent, hot blonde woman with a foreign accent, and and a catacombs.  There is even a scene where Cage has to decide whether to save the woman or save the Declaration of Independence (you will be surprized).  Despite these similarites, National Treasure holds its own and does not seem hackneyed.Nationan Treasure is an appropriate family movie, but is worth watching no matter how old you are.

According to the story, our founding fathers, which included several Free Masons, stashed away a treasure worth billions and billions of today's dollars. Ben follows an elaborate set of clues left by said founding fathers. When he discovers a truly important one, his benefactor turns on him because he wants the treasure for himself. Realizing his old partner will use any means necessary, Ben decides to fight fire with fire. This includes stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives in Washington, DC because there may be a map for  locating the treasure hidden on the back of the sacred document.Car chases and shoot outs follow as Ben and his nemesis look for the treasure.If you forget logic and reason, ""National Treasure"" can be quite entertaining.

As Ben and his friends get closer to finding the treasure, they face multiple challenges, including a nasty enemy (Sean Bean) intent on finding the treasure and keeping it all for himself, and a team of FBI agents (led by Harvey Keitel) who are after Ben for committing the minor infraction of stealing the Declaration of Independence. The film is full of suspenseful chases and an exciting treasure hunt that keeps the audience guessing until the very end.It's true that this movie is completely unrealistic and also rather silly at times, but it's also a lot of fun and provides quality entertainment: I don't think there's anyone out there that wouldn't relish in the idea of such a large-scale treasure hunt. The one thing about the film that bugged me was the character of Abigail (Diane Kruger), who works at the National Archives and ends up assisting Ben and his partner Riley (Justin Bartha) in their quest. I could buy the fact that Abigail would refuse to let Ben take off with the Declaration of Independence in hand, but the fact that she was so quick to join up with them in the end was just a little out there for me, and not at all true to the character that was sketched out for her in the beginning.

627176,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JN5E,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","Inspired by stories about the Knights Templar and the Masons, a fanciful tale about a long-lost treasure spanning centuries of history was created for the 2004 film ""National Treasure"".  Directed by Jon Turteltaub (who directed ""Phenomenon"" in 1996), the film suggests that the original Declaration of Independence contains a hidden map to the mythical treasure that was allegedly hidden by various Founding Fathers (including Benjamin Franklin) to prevent it from falling into British hands during the Revolutionary War.  Knowledge of the mythical treasure had been passed down through several generations of the Gates family until it reached the ears of Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) when he was a boy.  Ben spends most of his adult life searching for the only key to the treasure that he knows about: something called Charlotte.  With help from the unscrupulous Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Ben finds the Charlotte and discovers another key to the treasure that leads him (and Ian) to the Declaration of Independence, which is under the watchful care of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger).  Hoping to beat Ian to the Declaration, Ben is assisted by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) to try and steal it from the National Archives in Washington, D.C., in order to save it from Ian, who would not be inclined to not harm the precious 200-year-old document.  With a lot of suspense and chasing, Ben and Riley succeed with the unintended help from Abigail.  The Declaration does indeed hold some hidden information, but instead of being a map, it holds another set of clues in finding the treasure that include a set of old letters that Ben's father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), has in his possession.  Naturally, upon stealing the Declaration, the FBI gets involved and Ian is still determined to get the treasure before Ben can.  Will Ben be able to solve the mystery or will Ian or the FBI stand in his way?  You'll just have to watch this entertaining film to find out.The legends about the Knights Templar once having a huge treasure, as well as mysteries surrounding the Free Masons, were a good premise for creating the plot for ""National Treasure"".  With a mix of suspense, good special effects and interesting characters, the film works sufficiently well to keep most of the audience engaged throughout its 131 minutes.  Hence, overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  The DVD also includes deleted scenes, cryptography games and background documentary information.  Other interesting characters include FBI agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and Ben's grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer).",4,"""Who wants to go down the creepy tunnel?""",1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,2591,"['Inspired', 'stories', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Masons', 'fanciful', 'tale', 'long-lost', 'treasure', 'spanning', 'centuries', 'history', 'was', 'created', '2004', 'film', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Directed', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'who', 'directed', 'Phenomenon', '1996', 'film', 'original', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'hidden', 'map', 'mythical', 'treasure', 'was', 'allegedly', 'hidden', 'various', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'including', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'prevent', 'falling', 'British', 'hands', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'Knowledge', 'mythical', 'treasure', 'had', 'been', 'passed', 'down', 'several', 'generations', 'Gates', 'family', 'reached', 'ears', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'Ben', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'searching', 'only', 'key', 'treasure', 'something', 'called', 'Charlotte', 'help', 'unscrupulous', 'Ian', 'Howe', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Ben', 'Charlotte', 'key', 'treasure', 'Ian', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'watchful', 'care', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Hoping', 'beat', 'Ian', 'Declaration', 'Ben', 'assisted', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'try', 'steal', 'National', 'Archives', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'order', 'save', 'Ian', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'inclined', 'not', 'harm', 'precious', '200-year-old', 'document', 'lot', 'suspense', 'chasing', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'succeed', 'unintended', 'help', 'Abigail', 'Declaration', 'indeed', 'hold', 'hidden', 'information', 'instead', 'being', 'map', 'set', 'clues', 'finding', 'treasure', 'include', 'set', 'old', 'letters', 'Ben', 'father', 'Patrick', 'Gates', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'possession', 'Naturally', 'stealing', 'Declaration', 'FBI', 'involved', 'Ian', 'still', 'determined', 'get', 'treasure', 'Ben', 'can', 'Will', 'Ben', 'be', 'able', 'solve', 'mystery', 'will', 'Ian', 'FBI', 'stand', 'way', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'film', 'find', 'out.The', 'legends', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'once', 'having', 'huge', 'treasure', 'as', 'well', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'Free', 'Masons', 'were', 'good', 'premise', 'creating', 'plot', 'National', 'Treasure', 'mix', 'suspense', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'well', 'keep', 'most', 'audience', 'engaged', '131', 'minutes', 'Hence', 'overall', 'rate', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'cryptography', 'games', 'background', 'documentary', 'information', 'Other', 'interesting', 'characters', 'include', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sadusky', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Ben', 'grandfather', 'John', 'Adams', 'Gates', 'Christopher', 'Plummer']",National Treasure

As a movie, it's a ridiculously implausible plot, but it's also very engaging, well-written and involving.  The clues are presented in logical fashion and we find ourselves wondering exactly where the clues will lead us.  Nicolas Cage offers a sincere and heroic leading man persona and Diane Kruger is lovely and smart as the cryptographer who finds herself inadvertently along for the ride.  Justin Bartha as Riley, the sidekick is lots of fun to watch; he brings a joyous innocence and naivete to his role and obviously a lot of respect for his mentor.

627186,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B00005JN5E,Michael Zuffa,"[0, 0]","""National Treasure"" is a blatant rip-off of books by Dan Brown like ""Angels and Demons"" and the more recognizable ""The Da Vinci Code"".  The only real change instead of the controversial religious themes of the books, ""National Treasure"" centers around a treasure hunt.  Considering that this movie comes from the unholy duo of Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures, it is no surprise.  Bruckheimer has been turning out crap for years, and Disney's glory days are well behind it.That being said, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining (but unbelievealbe) movie.  Ben Gates (Cage) believes that the founding fathers have buries a treasure somewhere and have laid out clues to finding it.  In fact, his family for generations have believed it.  When Gates finally figures out a key clue, he is off to the Arctic in search of the treasure.  A double cross by one of his team (Bean) leaves him for dead and the bad guy after the treasure.  From then on, it is a race from clue to clue to find the hidden treasure.  Along the way, they even steal the Declaration of Independence.The action is fast paced and engaging, and the clues are woven into real world items.  Nicholas Cage does nothing special with Ben Gates, lapsing into standard Nicholas Cage mode.  Fortunately for him, that works (as it does in most of his movies).  The supporting cast also does a good job, but nothing spectacular.  ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining movie that most will like despite the Bruckheimer connection.",4,National Treasure,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1496,"['National', 'Treasure', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'books', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'more', 'recognizable', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'only', 'real', 'change', 'instead', 'controversial', 'religious', 'themes', 'books', 'National', 'Treasure', 'centers', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'Considering', 'movie', 'unholy', 'duo', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'surprise', 'Bruckheimer', 'been', 'turning', 'out', 'crap', 'years', 'Disney', 'glory', 'days', 'are', 'well', 'it.That', 'being', 'said', 'National', 'Treasure', 'entertaining', 'unbelievealbe', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Cage', 'founding', 'fathers', 'have', 'buries', 'treasure', 'somewhere', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'clues', 'finding', 'fact', 'family', 'generations', 'have', 'believed', 'When', 'finally', 'out', 'key', 'clue', 'Arctic', 'search', 'treasure', 'double', 'cross', 'one', 'team', 'Bean', 'dead', 'bad', 'guy', 'treasure', 'then', 'race', 'clue', 'clue', 'find', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'way', 'even', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'Independence.The', 'action', 'fast', 'paced', 'engaging', 'clues', 'are', 'woven', 'real', 'world', 'items', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'nothing', 'special', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'lapsing', 'standard', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'mode', 'Fortunately', 'most', 'movies', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'National', 'Treasure', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'most', 'will', 'like', 'Bruckheimer', 'connection']",National Treasure
627187,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00005JN5E,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 3]","National Treasure is about a man played by Nicolas Cage whose ancestors have been searching for generations for a missing treasure that goes all the way back to George Washington & Tomas Jefferson, and the Decloration Of Independence.After a lifetime searching for the treasure from the only remianing clue thats known, he finally finds what he was looking for, but discovers it's only the begining of the hunt. Especialy when members of his exploration team turn on him and go in search for the trasure themselves. Laws are broken, friendships ended and mayhem abrupts, but it's all just a fun ride to watch.Forget what the critics say, they are just concerned with what movies they can tip for emmy nominations and don't care that nobody gives a $#!% about those blockbuster, over produced, over paid actor movies made espeicly for awards that people get shoved down there throat, never actualy like it, but there over promoted enough for every one to have heard of by the end of the 1st week.National Treasure is no award winning movie, but thats a good thing, at least you can sit back and relax, kick the feet up and enjoy a film without boring dialog of some acadamey award winnnig speach. It's an action adventure film, and as you'd guess, there in search of lost treasure. It's suprising to know it's a Disney movie, but don't let that turn you away, it's ok for older kids, but it's not a little kids movie. It has interesting twists and turns, the plot is well concieved and it's enjoyable by anyone not more interested in whose wearing what to the A.A this year.The DVD is packed with extras. Theres deleted scenes, an alternate ending, a useless dialog track that says what the shot is establishing (I dunno why, either) a documentry about real life treasure hunters, and a few other things. There is also some hidden things on the disc; It's not exactly an Easter Egg but after each scene of the bonus features you will get a clue, then you use them in a sort of hidden E.Egg, enter the code you think is right, then there is another code after that. Or you could cheat and just search the net for the master code and enter that on the book up top of the main menu.",4,"It aint Indiana Jones, but it's still an enjoyable ride.",1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,2178,"['National', 'Treasure', 'man', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'ancestors', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'generations', 'missing', 'treasure', 'way', 'back', 'George', 'Washington', 'Tomas', 'Jefferson', 'Decloration', 'Independence.After', 'lifetime', 'searching', 'treasure', 'only', 'remianing', 'clue', 'thats', 'known', 'finally', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'only', 'begining', 'hunt', 'Especialy', 'when', 'members', 'exploration', 'team', 'turn', 'go', 'search', 'trasure', 'Laws', 'are', 'broken', 'friendships', 'ended', 'mayhem', 'abrupts', 'just', 'fun', 'ride', 'watch.Forget', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'are', 'just', 'concerned', 'what', 'movies', 'can', 'tip', 'emmy', 'nominations', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'nobody', '%', 'blockbuster', 'produced', 'paid', 'actor', 'movies', 'made', 'espeicly', 'awards', 'people', 'get', 'shoved', 'down', 'there', 'throat', 'never', 'actualy', 'there', 'promoted', 'enough', 'one', 'have', 'heard', 'end', '1st', 'week.National', 'Treasure', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'least', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'kick', 'feet', 'up', 'enjoy', 'film', 'boring', 'dialog', 'acadamey', 'award', 'winnnig', 'speach', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', ""'d"", 'guess', 'search', 'lost', 'treasure', 'suprising', 'know', 'Disney', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'turn', 'away', 'ok', 'older', 'kids', 'not', 'little', 'kids', 'movie', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'well', 'concieved', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'not', 'more', 'interested', 'wearing', 'what', 'A.A', 'year.The', 'DVD', 'packed', 'extras', 'Theres', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'useless', 'dialog', 'track', 'what', 'shot', 'establishing', 'dunno', 'why', 'either', 'documentry', 'real', 'life', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'also', 'hidden', 'things', 'disc', 'not', 'exactly', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'scene', 'bonus', 'will', 'get', 'clue', 'then', 'use', 'sort', 'hidden', 'E.Egg', 'enter', 'code', 'think', 'right', 'then', 'code', 'could', 'cheat', 'just', 'search', 'net', 'master', 'code', 'enter', 'book', 'up', 'top', 'main', 'menu']",National Treasure

627191,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JN5E,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 2]","Jerry Bruckheimer stands alone as the reigning king of Hollywood producers - not only does he have a combined domestic gross of nearly three billion dollars at the box office but he has stacked up the highest rated shows in television all on one network - Without a Trace, Cold Case, and the three Crime Scene Investigation shows. Unfortunately, his once golden touch is beginning to fade, at least in respects to his feature film division. Bad Boys II, despite being number one at the box office when it opened, failed to make as much as was expected, Veronica Guerin was barely noticed at the Academy Awards, let alone the box office, and King Arthur was another expensive miss for the Walt Disney Company, which had already been wracked with an awful summer prior to its release. The fact that this film has been boiling in the pre-production pot for the past three or four years doesn't bode well for its release, another poor domestic gross would be disastrous for Disney, but if Bruckheimer could make Pirates work despite its extensive problems, there's room for hope.The story centers on a man who must unlock a series of codes and riddles to unravel the greatest secret in America's history. Imagine for a moment the greatest treasure the world has ever known. Started long ago, this vast amount of gold coins, beautifully crafted sculptures, and historical ancient texts was passed on from one tyrannical dictatorship to the next, from the Egyptians to the Romans and so on, through the ages and, as it did so, the treasure grew with each passing century, until it suddenly vanished. Accidentally discovered by the knights of one of the crusades during the Middle Ages, these men, who would go on to be known as the Knights Template, took an oath to protect the secret of the fantastic treasure at any cost. As European progress began to expand westward, the treasure, along with the keepers of the mystery, were brought to the new world and hidden in America by the Founding Fathers themselves - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin - in order to be kept out of the hands of the British or any oppressive force that would desire it. Jumping forward to the modern day, Benjamin Franklin Gates is a third-generation ""treasure protector"" who has spent all of his life devoted to discovering the mysteries behind the age-old secrets of the national treasure, one his own father believes doesn't exist. Unfortunately, Gates is not the only one who seeks the national treasure and when word gets out about the invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, he must steal the sacred document before it falls into the wrong hands. What he thought was the last clue was only the beginning - one riddle leads to another clue and with each new discovery he draws ever closer to unlocking one of the greatest mysteries in this nation's, as well as the world's, history. The story for National Treasure is not a thing to be concreted on too longingly, though to be true, this one is a bit more of a thinker then the average film of the action-adventure genre, at least in recent months. It is, to be honest, a non-stop action-packed crime capper from beginning to end, though not in the sense of Ocean's Eleven and it's even paced style of play. We're talking mindless destruction, blazing bullets in every direction, and good old-fashioned chase sequences - the basic Bruckheimer package, complete with Nicholas Cage. If you're going for originality and, dare we say it, a bit of class, hold off on this thought until Ocean's Twelve opens in December.Nicholas Cage, an actor who owes practically his entire career to Jerry Bruckheimer for giving him his first break-out performance in The Rock back in 1996, and then another touted role in Con-Air, fits perfectly into the role even though it does take the character awhile to be comfortable with audiences. Unlike past hero roles in Bruckheimer flicks, the cards are already out on the table for this character - can't blame him too much though, he even says in the film he has a bad bluffing face. There's no emotional build-up for the character in the beginning and doesn't present himself as a natural bad-ass as Indiana Jones did, in certain respects, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Supposedly at one point in the course of writing then re-writing the script for this film, Krueger's character apparently was a central figure in the story's plot - what happened along the way to have this as a result? Abigail Chase adds nothing to the overall effective or efficiency of the storyline besides the whole slightly-subtle romantic subplot between Gates and Chase. Even the whole romantic angle between Nicholas Cage and Diane Krueger feels overly-forced, especially that out of the blue kiss near the end of the film. There's undoubtedly chemistry between the two from what little is seen on screen but there isn't enough time spent on that aspect to go beyond the sped-up version of the usual romantic formula in action flicks - annoying each other to the point of falling in love. Another character that fails to provide much, if any, material to the film was Jon Voight's Patrick Gates, the predictable and doubting father of our leading hero. The character itself is pathetically clich&eacute;d at worst, an absolute travesty at worst. The father believes the treasure to be a myth and says the son is wasting his entire life, a series of events twist fate, and suddenly he reveals to his son that he has always believed in him - anyone has a Kleenex? This isn't too much of squabble, barely noticeable except for the ending, which seems to be the main source of problems for this film. Here's a question though, with as many revisions as there were for this script, how is it that the ending was still never resolved properly? And finally, where would this film be without Justin Bartha's Riley Poole? An absolute drag, flat from start to finish, but thankfully that doesn't happen. His character is undoubtedly one of the most memorable highlights of the film and works well off-balancing the film's serious moments with sarcastic quips and humorous one-liners.Overall, National Treasure, when all is said and done, is the equivalent of splicing together the History Channel and FX - yes, it's funny to look at, visually engaging, and, perhaps, insightful into a particular area of study or interest which may be gained along the way but, as is the case with any relationship that that indulges in the concepts of fluff rather then concrete facts, there is bound to be a serious lack of substance. That theory holds true for each and every one of Jerry Bruckheimer's productions, given the exception of his television series on C-BS, but even that may be up for debate. It's not that National Treasure is a horrendous film, it's certainly no Raiders of the Lost Ark or even Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but still it is quite intriguing to say the least, but it undoubtedly lacks some originality and deliverance of results, most notably at the end. The reason the ending fails in its message is that the Founding Fathers didn't have a hippie-dippy view of society - they didn't believe that every human being was inherently born good; in fact they saw the world in quite the opposite way. This alone makes the finale illogical but, as has been said, people aren't expected to look too much into this. Will anyone truly learn anything extraordinary about the Founding Fathers, those who risked life and limb to ensure freedom from oppression and tyranny and to lay the foundation for the fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or, more importantly, anything about America herself? God, no! Please people, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film after all. I will give him credit though, he sure knows one Hell of a way to make an engaging action-caper without having to result to mindless blood-spilling and skin flashing - though he has covered that area as well with the Bad Boys series but that's another story - but do you really expect to have audiences come to his films to be educated? Quite frankly, you'd be lucky to find one gawk-eyed teenager exiting the theater that would be able to recall the name of one of the film's main characters, let alone of the one of the Founding Fathers of the Untied States of America. Then what is redeemable about this film? The musical score is fantastic and blends excessively well with the actions on screen - this has always, and will forever be, a key staple of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, no matter how bad the story is. The action sequences, though formulaic at times, do keep audience members engaged and as long as the interest is there, nothing matters as much in the end. And finally, though it may be historically inaccurate, the National Treasure thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously and can be enjoyed by even those who are easily put to sleep by the History Channel.  In fact, for those with embedded knowledge of the country's founding or any other ancient references throughout the film may even get a kick out of watching this film, whether be lapping up the incorporation of history and mythology or pointing out every single historical mistake present in the feature - whatever floats your boat. Oscar-caliber isn't even in the cards for this film but does anyone going to this film truly expect that type of quality? As always, spend wisely this holiday season.",4,The Moose Hole - Respectable Find,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,9448,"['Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'alone', 'reigning', 'king', 'Hollywood', 'producers',

On that note, this movie should not be taken for anything with a real film-style intrinsic value.The story is about a man whose family has been chasing the legend of a treasure for centuries, played by Nicolas Cage.  Unlike the rest of his family, Cage's character discovers the first clue but in doing so also creates a rival for the treasure. Of course the goal is to get the treasure.Overall I liked the movie.  The movie had humor, action, and just enough who-dunit to make the movie watcher not already know most of the plot.

WRONG, there is a back door to the treasure room that leads right to the tomb next to the secret one.

Both are dumb, cobbled together from the bits and pieces of other, better things and require a major suspension of disbelief.  Yet somehow, also like the Monster, National Treasure is, in the end, rather likeable.The premise of the story is that a number of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were aware of a massive treasure and decided to hide it behind a series of cryptic clues.  (Why the Founding Fathers would allow their young nation to struggle financially while they had such massive amounts of gold and relics is never explained.)  The only person who can possibly find said treasure is Nicholas Cage, who plays the descendant of the last man entrusted with the secret riddle.  Sean Bean plays his adversary who is motivated by simple greed.The first clue points to the Declaration of Independence, which apparently has a map on the back written in invisible ink.  Since Bean intends to steal the document, Cage knows he needs to steal it first.  They both decide to rob the National Archives at the same time, fortunately while a big fundraiser is going on.  Cage's initial success begins a series of cat-and-mouse chases between him and Bean with the FBI not far behind.I can almost picture the pitch meeting at the studio for this one.  ""The Da Vinci Code is hot.  Let's make our own version and throw in a bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

The movie features a secret treasure, preserved down the centuries by masonic inheritors of the tradition of the Knights Templar, eventually winding up in America.  The main character is a treasure hunter who has devoted his life to finding this treasure and is regarded by those in the historical community as a crank.  He originally became enthralled in his quest as a young boy when he found a secret in his grandfather's attic.  After nearly being blown to bits by dynamite in a sunken ship in the Arctic, the hero must travel to Washington, D. C. to prevent his nemesis from stealing the Constitution of the United States.  Apparently, according to the movie, the founding fathers were composed of masons who sought to protect the treasure by hiding it.  However, they managed to provide a treasure map on the back of the Constitution written in invisible ink.  The story unfolds as the hero attempts to prevent his nemesis from getting to the treasure first, and in the process a great deal of the hidden history of the United States of America is revealed.

627211,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JN5E,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 4]","The trailer for this film was intriguing, as who wouldn't want to see a film that teases us with a secret message written on the back of the Declaration of Independence and the hero's vow to steal our most famous document from the National Archives? With a premise like that, this film was a definite must see for anyone who loves a good adventure story or appreciates America's founding history, with it's rich symbolism and mysterious secrets connected to Freemasonry and the Knights Templar.Of course, I saw this film months after I had read ""The Da Vinci Code"", so my appreciation for this film was lessened as I felt it was a blatant rip-off of that phenomenal novel. I suspect sinister Hollywood theft at hand in making this film, as it follows the same type of twists and turns as that novel, and it's no secret that writer Dan Brown is currently researching/writing his follow-up, which will do for our Founding Fathers and the U.S. Capitol what he did for Da Vinci and the Pyramid du Louvre. Consider this film a pre-emptive move by Hollywood, so they don't have to shell out the big bucks for film rights on Dan Brown's new novel whenever it finally gets published.Make no mistake though, this film is highly entertaining as we follow the leads on a chase following strange clues that lead to the next clue. It has more twists than a ""Moonlighting"" episode. By the end, it doesn't amount to much and instantly forgettable by the time one made it home from the theater. The biggest unsatisfying factor of the film was its conformity to the cliched formula...as the lead actor gets the girl (who was little more than eye candy) and the sidekick is left alone. They even joke about that fact at the end of the film. Anyhow, yes, this movie made lots of money, defying film critics of their near universal animosity for this film. Whether you will like it or not depends on how much you enjoy being entertained versus how much you want to also learn a few things. This is popcorn escapism at its best. For those of us wanting more, it fails to deliver. Perhaps a more serious look at our nation's founding and the role of Freemasons will be made into a film one day, but this is not that film.",3,Pure popcorn film that leaves you unsatisfied,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2199,"['trailer', 'film', 'was', 'intriguing', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'secret', 'message', 'written', 'back', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'hero', 'vow', 'steal', 'most', 'famous', 'document', 'National', 'Archives', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'definite', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'America', 'founding', 'history', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'mysterious', 'secrets', 'connected', 'Freemasonry', 'Knights', 'Templar.Of', 'course', 'saw', 'film', 'months', 'had', 'read', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'appreciation', 'film', 'was', 'lessened', 'felt', 'was', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'phenomenal', 'novel', 'suspect', 'sinister', 'Hollywood', 'theft', 'hand', 'making', 'film', 'same', 'type', 'twists', 'novel', 'secret', 'writer', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'currently', 'researching/writing', 'follow-up', 'will', 'do', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'what', 'did', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Pyramid', 'du', 'Louvre', 'Consider', 'film', 'pre-emptive', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'shell', 'out', 'big', 'bucks', 'film', 'rights', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'new', 'novel', 'whenever', 'finally', 'published.Make', 'mistake', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'follow', 'leads', 'chase', 'following', 'strange', 'clues', 'lead', 'next', 'clue', 'more', 'twists', 'Moonlighting', 'episode', 'end', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'time', 'one', 'made', 'home', 'theater', 'biggest', 'unsatisfying', 'factor', 'film', 'was', 'conformity', 'cliched', 'formula', 'lead', 'actor', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'sidekick', 'left', 'alone', 'even', 'joke', 'fact', 'end', 'film', 'Anyhow', 'yes', 'movie', 'made', 'lots', 'money', 'defying', 'film', 'critics', 'universal', 'animosity', 'film', 'will', 'like', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'being', 'entertained', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'also', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'popcorn', 'escapism', 'best', 'wanting', 'more', 'deliver', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'serious', 'look', 'nation', 'founding', 'role', 'Freemasons', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'film']",National Treasure

While the premise is a bit strained (Freemasons and the Knights Templar his an astounding treasure ages ago, leaving subtle clues hidden in historical documents to lead modern-day treasure hunters to the cache), how many other movies offer thin premises for movies? Answer: LOTS of them.Nicholas Cage plays a historian obsessed with American history. (When he was a young child, his grandfather told him a family legend about a clue that led to a marvelous hidden treasure. The family's search for the treasure has made them academic laughing-stocks and has put remendous pressure on family relationships.) As an adult, he continues his search for the treasure, facing considerable personal danger (as well as a heaping dose of excitement) along the way.I thought National Treasure was a great family movie.

The premise was a bit far-fetched, but the story was nevertheless reasonably well told and produced.  It offered a great action-adventure story without the usual elements of wanton violence, heavy language, the obligatory sex scene, etc.  I felt perfectly comfortable letting my kids, ages 13 and 9, watch this one with us.My only real complaints are that the characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the plot line had a few significant holes in it.  I thought Cage's character, Benjamin Franklin Gates, was just a little too slick in figuring out the riddles and clues, almost entirely without error, while his evil counterpart, Ian, was only slightly less so.  I also thought Gates came across as excessively altruistic, but I guess that's okay since this is a Disney flick -- family values and all that.In my estimation the biggest plot gaps occurred right at the beginning of the movie.  First, one wonders how, within a few short decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all clues to the treasure's location had been lost, except one, which was passed on to the original Gates ancestor and just happened to be the one clue that led to all the others.  Much bigger, though, [SPOILER ALERT!  SPOILER ALERT!] was how Ben Gates figured out that ""Charlotte"" was a ship and where to find it.  I also thought it was a bit incongruous how the FBI was initially portrayed in a very negative light, only to enjoy the balance of the movie as a bunch of high tech superstuds.Notwithstanding these minor lapses, I quickly got over them and settled into the movie.  It was a rolicking good yarn if you have enough sense not to take it too seriously.  It also has a lot of intellectual appeal as you try to unravel the clues along with Ben Gates -- although he was much more astute about it than I, of course.  Good movie.

They are as indelible as original sin, as sure as death and taxes, as certain as the sun will rise in the east and W will continue to fester in the Oval Office. One of those axiomatic principles is that any movie, a priori in the strictest Kantian sense, with Nicholas Cage blows. And this one may blow a louder fart than any film I have ever seen. I must confess here that I am being rudely ungrateful to Amazon who from the goodness of their hearts sent me a copy for being such a good customer, and I honestly am flattered by the thought. But this is pure sh*te. Cage, were he not related to another overrated Hollywood type (what's the last good movie he made? Apocalypse, right?), would be a bartender or a disc josckey or being a sax player in a wedding band. This guy can't act. Nothing that he has ever been in has been anything other than awful.And it's all wrong here. The script is the worst written and worst delivered load of preposterous junk I have ever heard. When you see a scene at the North Pole and no one is shivering, there's a credibility gap that just broadens as the celluloid spills out. The movie is noisy, laden with explosions and cheesey special effects that make the B movies of the 50's seem like Fellini.I can't imagine what Sean Bean is doing in this film. He must not have been paid very much for LOTR. He delivers his lines and the look on his pathetic face tells you this was a money grab. It is melodramatic, infantile, arrested devlopment fueled bad adventure movie making. It is hyped as a new spin on Indiana Jones. Cage is so hamfisted and just plain bad that he makes the wooden Harrison Ford seem like Laurence Olivier.

627220,A1R96CRCV76XR0,B00005JN5E,Oliver Hardy Jr.,"[1, 1]","As I've said before, a movie doesn't have to be historically correct or realistic to be great.  A great story, great cast, and a great score pretty much make a great movie.The story starts when a young Benjamin Gates (later played by Nicholas Cage) is told a story, from his grandfather, about treasure hidden by the Freemasons somewhere in the U.S.  They left clues around us, on the dollar bill, the back of the Declaration of Independance, and in other historical places.  Young Benjamin becomes extremely interested in this tale.  His father, who spent a good deal of his life searching for this treasure, tells him it is only a false story, that there is no treasure.The story picks up years later as Ben is in Antarctica searching for a mysterious ship.  (I will stop here as I do not want to spoil the story for anyone.)Ben, (Nicholis Cage), Dr. Chase (Diane Kruger), Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and Ian Howe (Sean Bean), all perform their parts nicely.  Ben as a solemn treasure-seaker, Dr. Chase as a specialist in U.S. history,  Riley as a funny, intelligent computer whiz, and Ian as a greedy, rich man intent on getting the treasure for himself.  They all did a great job.The score is quite capable of sending a shiver down your spine and uses an electric guitar very nicely.  I recommend the soundtrack along with the DVD.If you like good, clean action/adventure movies National Treasure is a must-have.",5,The best movie of 2004,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1417,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'historically', 'correct', 'realistic', 'be', 'great', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'score', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'great', 'movie.The', 'story', 'when', 'young', 'Benjamin', 'Gates', 'later', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'told', 'story', 'grandfather', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'Freemasons', 'somewhere', 'U.S', 'left', 'clues', 'dollar', 'bill', 'back', 'Declaration', 'Independance', 'other', 'historical', 'places', 'Young', 'Benjamin', 'extremely', 'interested', 'tale', 'father', 'who', 'spent', 'good', 'deal', 'life', 'searching', 'treasure', 'only', 'false', 'story', 'treasure.The', 'story', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'Ben', 'Antarctica', 'searching', 'mysterious', 'ship', 'will', 'stop', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'story', 'anyone', 'Ben', 'Nicholis', 'Cage', 'Dr.', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Ian', 'Howe', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'perform', 'parts', 'nicely', 'Ben', 'solemn', 'treasure-seaker', 'Dr.', 'Chase', 'specialist', 'U.S.', 'history', 'Riley', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Ian', 'greedy', 'rich', 'man', 'intent', 'getting', 'treasure', 'did', 'great', 'job.The', 'score', 'quite', 'capable', 'sending', 'shiver', 'down', 'spine', 'electric', 'guitar', 'very', 'nicely', 'recommend', 'soundtrack', 'DVD.If', 'like', 'good', 'clean', 'action/adventure', 'movies', 'National', 'Treasure', 'must-have']",National Treasure

One of the previous reviews mentions that George Washington and Ben Franklin were Masons.  However, so were Sam Adams and Paul Revere.  In fact, it is said that the Boston Tea Party was preceded by a meeting of members of the Boston Lodge and many of the ""indians"" who threw the tea over the side were members of that lodge.  The Masons definitely had a major part in bringing the American Revolution to fruition and victory.As a third generation member of a Masonic family and a former U. S. History teacher, I love this film and have watched it as many times as I can, constantly finding new things about it.  The historic facts are on target as are the Masonic allusions.  (Don't get excited those of you looking for Masonic secrets; anything shown can be found in your local library)  These are interwoven with a bit of imagination into the plot to protect the Templar treasure, supposedly gathered over the centuries from lost civilizations.  How breathtaking to be able to read, once again, the scrolls from the library at Alexandra or to see centuries old pieces of art, which supposedly had been destroyed.  The treasure is sent to the New World to protect it from those in the Old World who would steal it from the peoples of the World.  And, where better to hide it but in one of the oldest, most revered churches in the United States, a place where George Washington actually worshipped - my, my.  Add to that the eye candy for male or female viewers of Diane Kruger, Sean Bean and Nicholas Cage along Jon Voight, who has become an elder statesmen of the acting profession, and Harvey Keitel giving his usual wry performance as the FBI agent in pursuit, not of the treasure, but of those who would dare steal the Declaration of Independence.An exciting story wrapped around real history with marvelous performances.

The film is an obvious ripoff of the DaVinci Code. I distinctly remember seeing previews for this film soon after reading the Dan Brown's best selling book.  The similarities are so close that it is sickening.Ben Gates is a treasure hunter with a great knack for solving riddles and codes.  He discovers that codes are hidden on historical American objects, such as the Declaration of Independence, and hidden around Washington D.C. and other historical places.  He even has a cute girl who helps him as he tries to avoid the FBI and another group of treasure hunters who are after the same thing.National Treasure brings nothing new to the action/adventure genre.  Every scene from the film looks as if it was lifted from another movie.  If you've ever seen a film where the bad guy is chasing the good guy because they have the object of their desire, then you've seen this movie.

It is a treasure hunt full of action, adventure, humor, and unbelievability.  And it is clean enough for the kids.  Put reality aside and go with it, you will have an exciting ride.A HINT ABOUT THE MENU: Finding all of the extras on the disc is a treasure hunt unto itself.  In the MAIN menu, highlight the book on the top right. A hidden page will appear with numbers on the left & options on the right.  On the left select these numbers in this order: 4, 0, 5.  Then on the right select ""Submit Master Code"" and hit the enter button.  You will now get a complete listing of all of the extras.Another way to get to the hidden extras not on the regular extras menu is to follow the above directions, but select the numbers in this order: 3, 9, 7.  Then on the right select ""Submit Secret Code"".  This time only the hidden extras will show up.There are some flaws with the story.1) During the treasure hunt, one of the clues is to be found in a shadow created at a certain time of day.  But the message does not say what time of year this would happen.  Since the sun is in a different position through out the year, the shadow would be created in different areas.  With all of the attention to details, I am surprised this was overlooked.2) The moral: Stealing is O.K. if you feel it is for a good purpose. And you can get away with it if there is someone else trying to steal your stolen goods.It is also a little unbelievable that the first clue is deciphered to say the map is on the back of the Declaration Of Independence.  The way they got to this conclusion is far fetched and members of the gang should have doubted this.  I guess that would have only slowed down the story and the director wanted to get it going.Oh, don't tell the kids this, but they will learn some history lessons from this movie.

The treaure-hunters' father does not play a big part of ""National Treasure"", and I find the part so small it surprises me they even got the fantastic Jon Voight to act in it (well, good money not charity of course...).What I didn't expect was for the entire (almost anyway) treasure-hunt to take place in a town (in the US). A race among two rivaling themes (one good, one bad - of course) among thousands of people with their map leading them to clue after clue. And then finally to the treasure of course, it is Walt Disney. I expected deserts and ancient, buried pyramids. So it turned out to be far more ""James Bond""/""Mission Impossible"" than ""Indiana Jones"". And it worked.Action/Adventure would be a proper description of ""National Treasure"".

That's good because, if it slowed down some, we would have more time to reflect on how virtually impossible it is to believe.  I made a decision early on to just enjoy the movie for the mystery, action, and suspense and leave the impossibilities for later.The premise of the movie is that an ancient treasure has been hidden for over two centuries in the US.  One person was given a clue to its' whereabouts about 150 years ago and his descendants have been trying to sort out the clue ever since.  Along comes the current generation's sleuth who has the money and the brains to follow the lead.  Once the search begins, the movie really takes off.  The movie is aided by the division of searchers into two competing groups (of course, one is good and one is bad).  The government agents are chasing after both of them and the three-way competion expands the action.  One clue solved leads to another clue to figure out.  On and on it goes but by this point we are either totally wrapped up in the story or in total denial that anyone could believe this.As I allowed myself to buy into the plot, I received, in return, a very good movie.  The acting is not as good as the writing nor the directing as good as the cinematography but so what.

The thrills, mysteries and suspense are really significant and of course, you could add the joy ride of chasing and action packed scenes which adds luster to the movie. I was so amazed by the fact of its touch of history blending with the fictional presentation or style of story telling. It was actually blended with vital history highlights.Nicolas Cage character as Benjamin Franklin Gates is cool and smart and he done a great job for portraying as what he call themselves (with Bartha) as 'treasure-protectors'. Justin Bartha as Riley Poole adds comic relief (sometimes foolish lines delivery) while Dianne Kruger as Dr. Chase gave a near-believable character as an Archive Director. What can I say about the production? Jerry Bruckheimer is the master of all good-production maker for films. I have never imagined an ancient-like or crypt underneath the city as the movie presented.

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 2]","I spend a lot of time arguing online and thinking about how literature presents truth and why we only believe historically and scientifically accurate accounts to be true, anything else is labelled and discarded intellectually as fiction. So please forgive me if i see this theme dominating the movie as well, you know the saying: to a man whose only tool is a hammer, all problems are nails.The movie is good, compelling, engrossing, absorbing, a good way to spend 2 hours out of the afternoon heat.It is this link between the artist and his audience, what is believable and persuadable to us that i find useful in the move after leaving the theatre. Is there this enormous wealth hidden under the graveyard just off Wall Street? of course not, but how the author persuades us to believe that it just might be true is marvelous. He does so by realistically giving us enough facts that we find truthful that we jump over the connections to the next set and joyfully embrace the artist's vision, despite it's blatant foolishness. There is enough truth that we suspend disbelief for the important steps, for the awkward things that we would never embrace if presented by themselves. We find the package believable because we recognize the wrapping, in our eagerness to unwrap an adventure and a stimulating chase, we jump to normally unwarranted conclusions.For example, i watched ""Sky Captain"" this week. It's mixture of historical and mythical put the whole movie into the comic book genre, fun but unpersuasive. Now are the Masons the descendents of the Knights Templar? Possibly, there has been a rash of books proposing just that for 20 years, but they all are panned and dismissed by the critics. Perhaps the same critics that find this a believable and fun movie, despite the fact that it makes much more unbelievable claims then does _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_. But it does so by leading into the weaknesses of our cultural epistemology not by confronting it directly. This is the secret of such movie successes and the reason for the failure of the literature genre that HB,HG represents. People want to believe the bizzare, the Xfiles garbage, they only want it packaged in historical and scientific wrapping. For it is the wrapping, not the contents that interest most people. They really aren't interested in the science or underlying reasons, they only want the illusion to cover up their itching ears and wandering eyes. We desire to be deceived and seduced, we just don't want to let other people know it and cover it with the legitimatizer of the day-science.We love racing and outthinking the competition- see the ""Amazing Race"". We love gadgets and trinkets, toys and things that glitter. But we want to justify these desires by claiming that they are both useful (pragmatic and utilitarian) and good (moral and uplifting). By tying these things together the authors etc of NT both involve us and excuse our weaknesses, justifying our entracement while excusing the fact that we justify the unbelievable by making it look like history. This is the magic of the historical novel, unlike the comic book or the fantasy like Shriek, we can be persuaded that it just might have happened. That it is believable because the package conforms to our societal notions of truthfulness as outlined by science and historical research.It is the Xfiles phenomena, we unrighteously suspend disbelief because the authors have given us a package wrapped in our favorite and most persuasive stories.It is Kipling's just so stories updated to the greed of the 21st century with the amazing race thrown in since we love a winner.and the winner gets not just the pretty girl, the manorhouse on the green but a really hot red sports car.",4,the form and package convinces you of the contents,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,3728,"['spend', 'lot', 'time', 'arguing', 'online', 'thinking', 'how', 'literature', 'presents', 'truth', 'why', 'only', 'believe', 'historically', 'scientifically', 'accurate', 'accounts', 'be', 'true', 'anything', 'else', 'labelled', 'discarded', 'intellectually', 'fiction', 'please', 'forgive', 'i', 'see', 'theme', 'dominating', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'saying', 'man', 'only', 'tool', 'hammer', 'problems', 'are', 'nails.The', 'movie', 'good', 'compelling', 'engrossing', 'absorbing', 'good', 'way', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'afternoon', 'heat.It', 'link', 'artist', 'audience', 'what', 'believable', 'persuadable', 'i', 'find', 'useful', 'move', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'there', 'enormous', 'wealth', 'hidden', 'graveyard', 'just', 'Wall', 'Street', 'course', 'not', 'how', 'author', 'believe', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'marvelous', 'so', 'realistically', 'giving', 'enough', 'facts', 'find', 'truthful', 'jump', 'connections', 'next', 'set', 'joyfully', 'embrace', 'artist', 'vision', 'blatant', 'foolishness', 'enough', 'truth', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'important', 'steps', 'awkward', 'things', 'would', 'never', 'embrace', 'presented', 'find', 'package', 'believable', 'recognize', 'wrapping', 'eagerness', 'unwrap', 'adventure', 'stimulating', 'chase', 'jump', 'normally', 'unwarranted', 'conclusions.For', 'example', 'i', 'watched', 'Sky', 'Captain', 'week', 'mixture', 'historical', 'mythical', 'put', 'whole', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'genre', 'fun', 'unpersuasive', 'Now', 'are', 'Masons', 'descendents', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Possibly', 'been', 'rash', 'books', 'proposing', 'just', '20', 'years', 'are', 'panned', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'Perhaps', 'same', 'critics', 'find', 'believable', 'fun', 'movie', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'claims', 'then', '_Holy', 'Blood', 'Holy', 'Grail_', 'so', 'leading', 'weaknesses', 'cultural', 'epistemology', 'not', 'confronting', 'directly', 'secret', 'such', 'movie', 'successes', 'reason', 'failure', 'literature', 'genre', 'HB', 'HG', 'People', 'want', 'believe', 'bizzare', 'Xfiles', 'garbage', 'only', 'want', 'packaged', 'historical', 'scientific', 'wrapping', 'wrapping', 'not', 'contents', 'interest', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'science', 'underlying', 'reasons', 'only', 'want', 'illusion', 'cover', 'up', 'itching', 'ears', 'wandering', 'eyes', 'desire', 'be', 'deceived', 'seduced', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'know', 'cover', 'legitimatizer', 'day-science.We', 'love', 'racing', 'outthinking', 'competition-', 'see', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'love', 'gadgets', 'trinkets', 'toys', 'things', 'glitter', 'want', 'justify', 'desires', 'claiming', 'are', 'useful', 'pragmatic', 'utilitarian', 'good', 'moral', 'uplifting', 'tying', 'things', 'together', 'authors', 'etc', 'NT', 'involve', 'excuse', 'weaknesses', 'justifying', 'entracement', 'excusing', 'fact', 'justify', 'unbelievable', 'making', 'look', 'history', 'magic', 'historical', 'novel', 'comic', 'book', 'fantasy', 'Shriek', 'can', 'be', 'persuaded', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'believable', 'package', 'societal', 'notions', 'truthfulness', 'outlined', 'science', 'historical', 'research.It', 'Xfiles', 'phenomena', 'unrighteously', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'authors', 'have', 'given', 'package', 'wrapped', 'favorite', 'most', 'persuasive', 'stories.It', 'Kipling', 'just', 'so', 'stories', 'updated', 'greed', '21st', 'century', 'amazing', 'race', 'thrown', 'love', 'winner.and', 'winner', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'girl', 'manorhouse', 'green', 'really', 'hot', 'red', 'sports', 'car']",National Treasure

and half truths regarding the Masons and Knights Templar and all shaken and stirred into an Indiana Jones ""glass"".It contains a good solid cast of actors and coupled with Jon Turteltaub's taught directing skills this film is a clear winner.The story involves one Ben Gates(Nick Cage)whose family has been guarding a passed down secret of a huge long lost treasure for generations.Finally getting a financial backer one Ian Howe(Sean Bean),they travel to the Arctic to uncover a long lost ship which contains a clue.The clue tells Ben the next important piece of the puzzle lies on the back of the Declaration of Independence.Howe tells him that he can obtain the document and this is the moment Ben realizes he has hooked up with the wrong people.A skirmish ensues and the ship blows up leaving Ben and a friend stranded,having to walk to the nearest settlement to be rescued.Back in New York Ben visits several law enforcement agencies in an effort to alert them of what is coming.No one believes him and he decides in order to protect the valuable document he will steal it himself.Amazingly this is what he does with both the law and Howe on his tail.Mixed up in this is the curator of the the National Archives in Washington Dr.Chase(Diane Kruger).She inadvertently has to go on the run with Ben and they end up at the home of his father Patrick(Jon Voight),who has been a skeptic of the entire legend all his life.Ben finds his code and it makes a now skeptical believer out of Dr Chase also.When his father discovers what his son really has he is beside himself.In order to keep his father out of the situation however they tie him up and leave him just as the FBI shortly thereafter arrives at the house.Howe is always dogging Ben and company's footsteps as they travel to Independence Hall in Philly.There they find a strange pair of bi-focals with which to view the back of the Declaration.The treasure they seek is under the old Trinity Church back in NYC.The FBI at one point lays a trap for Ben and for his pursuers Mr.Howe,but Ben manages to escape with the help of Howe who now has his friend,Dr Chase and his father captive.They all travel to the Church and discover a huge grotto which they descend.At the bottom is a room with nothing in it.Ben's father tells Howe the next clue lies in the North Tower in Boston,which is where Howe heads leaving the group stranded.However it is a false clue and Ben discovers an ante room which contains the real treasure.It is filled with thousands of years worth of artifacts and history.When the group re-enters the Church above the FBI swoops in.They are looking for fall guys and Ben gives them Howe and his men at the Church in Boston.As Ben wanted,the treasure/discovery is released to a museum in Cairo for the benefit of all mankind.Once the movie establishes its premise the action seems to flow non stop throughout and the 130 minutes flies by very fast.Not only is the direction here very good,the editing of the film is fantastic and gives a greater impact to those moments which otherwise would have lagged.Cage,Voight,Bean,Kruger,Keitel(as an FBI man),et al turn in very good performances in their respective parts.The movie is presented in its' widescreen 2:33:1 aspect ratio and the transfer is crisp and clean.Extras include a behind the scene featurette,deleted scenes,an alternate ending,director movie commentary, Knights Templar and ""Treasure Hunters revealed"" featurettes,an animatic of the opening scene(an animated storyboard)and some puzzle challenges(each special feature has a letter code to it).All in all a highly recommended action packed film which is suitable for everyone's enjoyment.Made by Bruckheimer's production unit(Bruckheimer himself was deep into the

627259,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JN5E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","National Treasure (Jon Turteltaub, 2004)I had always remembered National Treasure as being something of a flop, so I was very confused last year when its sequel actually got a theatrical release. It was, of course, laughed out of theaters after only a few weeks, as I suspected given my memories of the reviews of the original, but it did convince me to sit down and actually watch the original to see if I'd missed anything. I didn't.The ludicrous plot concerns Ben Gates (Nic Cage in yet another role he really had no business playing), a treasure hunter who decides that, like his grandfather (Christopher Plummer), he's going after the biggest treasure of them all: the wealth accumulated by those Founding Fathers who were members of the Illuminati. (Well, okay, they're not called the Illuminati in the movie, but everyone knows the tall tales about the pyramid on the dollar bill, etc., right?) Set up against Gates is an old partner of his, Ian Howe (Sean Bean), and the curator of the National Archive, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She's not fond of him because, supposedly, one of the clues is on the back of the Declaration of Independence. (This isn't a spoiler because it was, after all, the subject of most of the movie's trailers.) Also against him is his own father (Jon Voight), who gave up all that treasure-hunting nonsense, and expected his kid to do the same. Ah, fathers, why do they never learn that the family business skips a generation? In any case, all this leads to a great number of car chases and near-falls into bottomless pits and the like as Gates and Howe race to get to the treasure first.I get the feeling that Turteltaub (whose last really good movie--and this is arguable--was 1993's Cool Runnings) had a vision in his head of this being a kind of American-centered history lesson in the tradition of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. After all, Gates and Howe hit all the big historical sites, and there's all sorts of great footage of the Liberty Bell, the National Archives, that sort of thing. But Bill and Ted's effectiveness, and its continuing charm, come from the history lessons being delivered with more than a smidgen of humor. And yes, the script here--adapted by Jim Kouf (Rush Hour) from his own story idea--does make some lame attempts at humor, but in general, especially during the action scenes, it takes itself way, way too seriously.Having said all that, it's not an entirely awful movie. The action sequences are a lot of fun when they're not wallowing in action-sequence clich&eacute; (do we really need one more scene of someone hanging off the open back door of a van during a high-speed chase?), and the script does manage a few clever moments, but overall it's something to catch on late-night TV when you're suffering from insomnia. Nic Cage as an action hero is enough to put anyone to sleep. **",2,I finally let my curiosity get the best of me,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2864,"['National', 'Treasure', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', '2004', 'had', 'always', 'remembered', 'National', 'Treasure', 'being', 'something', 'flop', 'was', 'very', 'confused', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'sequel', 'actually', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'course', 'laughed', 'theaters', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'suspected', 'given', 'memories', 'reviews', 'original', 'did', 'convince', 'sit', 'down', 'actually', 'watch', 'original', 'see', ""'d"", 'missed', 'anything', ""didn't.The"", 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'yet', 'role', 'really', 'had', 'business', 'playing', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'who', 'grandfather', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'going', 'biggest', 'treasure', 'wealth', 'accumulated', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'who', 'were', 'members', 'Illuminati', 'Well', 'okay', ""'re"", 'not', 'called', 'Illuminati', 'movie', 'everyone', 'tall', 'tales', 'pyramid', 'dollar', 'bill', 'etc.', 'right', 'Set', 'up', 'Gates', 'old', 'partner', 'Ian', 'Howe', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'curator', 'National', 'Archive', 'Abigail', 'Chase', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'not', 'fond', 'supposedly', 'one', 'clues', 'back', 'Declaration', 'Independence', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'was', 'subject', 'most', 'movie', 'trailers', 'Also', 'own', 'father', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'treasure-hunting', 'nonsense', 'expected', 'kid', 'do', 'same', 'Ah', 'fathers', 'why', 'do', 'never', 'learn', 'family', 'business', 'skips', 'generation', 'case', 'great', 'number', 'car', 'chases', 'near-falls', 'bottomless', 'pits', 'like', 'Gates', 'Howe', 'race', 'get', 'treasure', 'first.I', 'get', 'feeling', 'Turteltaub', 'last', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'arguable', 'was', '1993', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'had', 'vision', 'head', 'being', 'kind', 'American-centered', 'history', 'lesson', 'tradition', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'Gates', 'Howe', 'hit', 'big', 'historical', 'sites', 'sorts', 'great', 'footage', 'Liberty', 'Bell', 'National', 'Archives', 'sort', 'thing', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'effectiveness', 'continuing', 'charm', 'come', 'history', 'lessons', 'being', 'delivered', 'more', 'smidgen', 'humor', 'yes', 'script', 'here', 'adapted', 'Jim', 'Kouf', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'own', 'story', 'idea', 'make', 'lame', 'attempts', 'humor', 'general', 'especially', 'action', 'scenes', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'seriously.Having', 'said', 'not', 'entirely', 'awful', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'wallowing', 'action-sequence', 'clich', 'eacute', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'scene', 'someone', 'hanging', 'off', 'open', 'back', 'door', 'van', 'high-speed', 'chase', 'script', 'manage', 'few', 'clever', 'moments', 'overall', 'something', 'catch', 'late-night', 'TV', 'when', ""'re"", 'suffering', 'insomnia', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'action', 'hero', 'enough', 'put', 'anyone', 'sleep', '**']",National Treasure

Zwick,"[5, 6]","**1/2For those who simply can't wait until ""The DaVinci Code"" makes its way to the big screen, there's ""National Treasure"" to serve as a sort of second hand substitute in the meantime.  Like the Dan Brown bestseller, this is a wildly improbable caper tale set in the context of historical fiction.Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a man who has spent his whole adult life in pursuit of a treasure that he believes the Founding Fathers hid in the late 18th Century, a search that has obsessed and ruined the lives of his own forebears for generations.  He is teamed with Ian (Sean Bean), a less savory fortune hunter who has no qualms about breaking the law or eliminating anyone who stands in the way of getting what he wants.  When these two men become convinced that there is an invisible map leading to the treasure hidden on the back of the original Declaration of Independence, the highly-principled Ben opts to forego the treasure, while Ian decides to steal the priceless document.  It is only when Ben realizes that he must steal the document in order to save it from Ian`s diabolical clutches that he springs into action.  From then on, it becomes a race against time, as Ben and his cohorts try to unearth the clues and crack the codes that lead to the treasure before Ian and his henchmen can do the same - all while being chased by FBI agents who are hot on his tail.  Frankly, one would have thought that the Founding Fathers - what with a war to fight and a nation to found - would have had more important things to do with their time than devise all the elaborate plotting necessary to set up this search.  But, apparently, one would have been wrong.The movie may be fine fun for 12-year-old boys of all ages, but the rest of us will find much of it cheesy and unconvincing.  There's always a certain satisfaction that comes with watching stories like these - that of following the clues and then piecing together all the fragments to achieve the full picture - but ""National Treasure"" is really only mildly diverting even in its best moments.  Those generally come when we find ourselves at great historic sites such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Old North Church etc.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is generally inane, and the acting - well, let's just say that's it's performances like this one that make it increasingly difficult to remember that Cage once walked off the stage clutching an Academy statuette for best actor in his hands.  Too often the film feels juvenile and slapdash, especially in the romantic pairing of Cage and Diane Kruger, as a curator of the National Archives who reluctantly comes along for the ride.The Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves.",2,DaVinci Code lite,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2727,"['**1/2For', 'who', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'National', 'Treasure', 'serve', 'sort', 'second', 'hand', 'substitute', 'meantime', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'bestseller', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'caper', 'tale', 'set', 'context', 'historical', 'fiction.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Gates', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'whole', 'adult', 'life', 'pursuit', 'treasure', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'hid', 'late', '18th', 'Century', 'search', 'obsessed', 'ruined', 'lives', 'own', 'forebears', 'generations', 'teamed', 'Ian', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'less', 'savory', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'who', 'qualms', 'breaking', 'law', 'eliminating', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'getting', 'what', 'When', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'convinced', 'invisible', 'map', 'leading', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'back', 'original', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'highly-principled', 'Ben', 'opts', 'forego', 'treasure', 'Ian', 'steal', 'priceless', 'document', 'only', 'when', 'Ben', 'must', 'steal', 'document', 'order', 'save', 'Ian', 's', 'diabolical', 'clutches', 'action', 'then', 'race', 'time', 'Ben', 'cohorts', 'try', 'unearth', 'clues', 'crack', 'codes', 'lead', 'treasure', 'Ian', 'henchmen', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'being', 'chased', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'tail', 'Frankly', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'what', 'war', 'fight', 'nation', 'found', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'do', 'time', 'devise', 'elaborate', 'plotting', 'necessary', 'set', 'up', 'search', 'apparently', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wrong.The', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'fun', '12-year-old', 'boys', 'ages', 'rest', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'cheesy', 'unconvincing', 'always', 'certain', 'satisfaction', 'watching', 'stories', 'following', 'clues', 'then', 'piecing', 'together', 'fragments', 'achieve', 'full', 'picture', 'National', 'Treasure', 'really', 'only', 'mildly', 'diverting', 'even', 'best', 'moments', 'generally', 'come', 'when', 'find', 'great', 'historic', 'sites', 'such', 'Independence', 'Hall', 'Liberty', 'Bell', 'Old', 'North', 'Church', 'etc', 'Unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'generally', 'inane', 'acting', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'performances', 'one', 'make', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'remember', 'Cage', 'once', 'walked', 'off', 'stage', 'clutching', 'Academy', 'statuette', 'best', 'actor', 'hands', 'Too', 'often', 'film', 'feels', 'juvenile', 'slapdash', 'especially', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'Cage', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'curator', 'National', 'Archives', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'along', 'ride.The', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'must', 'be', 'rolling', 'graves']",National Treasure

Black Hawk Down is one of the few movies I've seen that he was attached to that didn't suck massively. Seriously, how can you possibly mess up a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well by poorly ripping off Titanic I guess. So I broke down this weekend and picked up National Treasure and hoped Bruckheimer actually devised a plot for the movie.National Treasure follows a family in search of a long lost treasure that was supposedly hidden by our founding founders. Nick Cage plays the son who is still searching for it while Jon Voight is the skeptical dad whose life was ruined by unsuccessfully looking. With the son being the treasure hunter (or as Cage's Ben Gates says, ""Treasure protectors"") and dad being skeptical, parallels are easily drawn with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They even throw in a hot German chick just for fun. But the German chick in this movie has been nationalized and has access to the Declaration of Independence. That, of course, comes in handy when Gates needs to steal it.Gates need to steal the Declaration of Independence because his former partner, evil English dude, plans to steal it to use it to find the treasure for his own personal collection. Rounding out the cast is Gates' sidekick, Riley (think Short Round from Temple of Doom but older and less Asian), and Harvey Keitel in a rare good guy turn as the FBI agent who is looking for Gates.The plot is surprisingly decent. They is a good balance between historically accuracy and aspects that were made up to go with the storyline. You can really tell that some did their homework to make sure what could be accurate is and what is made up could be plausible. As for the action, Bruckheimer kept the big explosions to only one, which has to be a record low for him. The biggest disappointment I had with the action was, if you remember back to the trailer (which is missing from the DVD release, I hate when that happens), Gates is holding on to the hot German chick and asks her; ""Do you trust me?"" And she say, ""yes"" than Gates drops her. Everybody and their mothers were like ""Whoa"" when they first saw it but when you see it in the context of the film, it is obvious that she really isn't in any danger.As for the extras on the DVD, I mentioned earlier that it lack the theatrical trailer yet it had the Verison commercial that when along with the film for some reason. It also had a nice documentary about present day treasure hunters and another one about the making of the movie. It also had the prerequisite deleted scenes, neither of which were that interesting. It also had an alternate ending, and to honest they went with the better ending in the movie. The cool thing about the extras is they give you clues that will help you unlock some more extra materials.",4,It's All About the Benjamins Baby,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2979,"['Typically', 'try', 'avoid', 'anything', 'do', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'how', 'last', 'name', 'pass', 'spell', 'check', 'cost', 'considering', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'watching', 'things', 'blow', 'up', 'surrounded', 'lousy', 'plot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'one', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'attached', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck', 'massively', 'Seriously', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'mess', 'up', 'movie', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Well', 'poorly', 'ripping', 'off', 'Titanic', 'guess', 'So', 'broke', 'down', 'weekend', 'picked', 'up', 'National', 'Treasure', 'hoped', 'Bruckheimer', 'actually', 'devised', 'plot', 'movie.National', 'Treasure', 'family', 'search', 'long', 'lost', 'treasure', 'was', 'supposedly', 'hidden', 'founding', 'founders', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'son', 'who', 'still', 'searching', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'skeptical', 'dad', 'life', 'was', 'ruined', 'unsuccessfully', 'looking', 'son', 'being', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'Cage', 'Ben', 'Gates', 'Treasure', 'protectors', 'being', 'skeptical', 'parallels', 'are', 'easily', 'drawn', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'even', 'throw', 'hot', 'German', 'chick', 'just', 'fun', 'German', 'chick', 'movie', 'been', 'nationalized', 'access', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'course', 'handy', 'when', 'needs', 'steal', 'it.Gates', 'need', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'former', 'partner', 'evil', 'English', 'dude', 'steal', 'use', 'find', 'treasure', 'own', 'personal', 'collection', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Gates', 'sidekick', 'Riley', 'think', 'Short', 'Round', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'older', 'less', 'Asian', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'rare', 'good', 'guy', 'turn', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'looking', 'Gates.The', 'plot', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'good', 'balance', 'historically', 'accuracy', 'aspects', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'go', 'storyline', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'did', 'homework', 'make', 'sure', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'accurate', 'what', 'made', 'up', 'could', 'be', 'plausible', 'action', 'Bruckheimer', 'kept', 'big', 'explosions', 'only', 'one', 'be', 'record', 'low', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'had', 'action', 'was', 'remember', 'back', 'trailer', 'missing', 'DVD', 'release', 'hate', 'when', 'Gates', 'holding', 'hot', 'German', 'chick', 'Do', 'trust', 'say', 'yes', 'Everybody', 'mothers', 'were', 'Whoa', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'see', 'context', 'film', 'obvious', 'really', ""n't"", 'danger.As', 'extras', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'yet', 'had', 'Verison', 'commercial', 'when', 'along', 'film', 'reason', 'also', 'had', 'nice', 'documentary', 'present', 'day', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'one', 'making', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'prerequisite', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'also', 'had', 'alternate', 'ending', 'honest', 'went', 'better', 'ending', 'movie', 'cool', 'thing', 'extras', 'give', 'clues', 'will', 'help', 'unlock', 'more', 'extra', 'materials']",National Treasure

The ""Decode This!"" game was fun and educational, plus you can enter codes to access other menus. (The problem is, to figure out one of the codes, you have to fast-forward through the first four bonus features [all documentaries] on page one before continuing onto page two.) The second menu had that game. I also like the Verizon commercial as well. (Are they available in Canada?) And get this - after minutes of gruel, hard work on this disc, trying to figure out the master code, I was expecting a more challenging game like on the ""Beauty and the Beast"" second disc, but what's it really?

627290,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00005JN5E,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 3]","""National Treasure"" isn't a bad movie.  It's just one of those productions calculated to hit every predictable result in its target audience, as polished and hermetically sealed as the fabled treasure its characters seek.  Nicholas Cage, who long ago entertained me somehow in ""Valley Girl"" and ""Raising Arizona,"" turns in his requisite blank performance as Benjamin Franklin Gates, the last, we're told, of a family of well-to-do, toupeed kooks obsessed with finding the treasure of colonial Free Masons.  Perhaps disturbingly, the women of the family are long gone, leaving first Christopher Plummer and then Jon Voight to impart wisdom in their off-kilter ways, though the love interest played by the Keira Knightly-ish (herself rather Winona Ryder-ish) Diana Kruger does her chilly best to keep the boys honest.  When Gates is double-crossed by Bond wannabe Sean Bean, things get tense, first as the ex-partners each devise a robbery of the Declaration of Independence and later, when the film gets inspiration from the Indiana Jones series in what looks like the next attraction at Disney World.  Director Jon Turteltaub keeps things moving at a brisk pace, helped by a percussive, familiar electronic score, which is good considering the story mostly consists of standard chases and a rundown of clues that seems right out of ""Scooby Doo.""

It's location is a secret, and he has spent his life looking for it. Before him his dad looked for it until he got frustrated and bitterly gave up. His grandfather also searched for it. There's clues to be found, and each clue leads to another clue, and eventually they find out that there's a clue hidden on the back of the declaration of independence. Earlier on, for financial support he hooked up with a rich dude with questionable ethics, but then the rich guy decides he no longer needs cage, so he tries to kill him. Cage ends up just beating the guy to stealing the declaration and so it's basically a race to find the treasure at that point. Meanwhile the FBI is trying to catch Cage also, as they don't know about the rich guy even. It was a pretty fun movie, in the respect of indiana jones movies.

Since this is a Disney movie(hard to believe)it has some gunshots fired but this movie is mostly a race to the treasure, so expect to see alot of running and watch Ben and Co and his foes play hot potato with the Declaration of Independence(since their is a treasure map on the back that leads to the treasure)The negatives-Sometimes the movie can seem a little unreal since i think it is impossible to steal the Declaration O.I. and some of the action scenes like when Ben is hanging and swinging on a van's back door while the van is in motion while avoiding oncoming traffic.And the whole treasure hunt around the country does seem unreal, but hey thats why it's a movie right?Conclusion-I urge you to atleast rent this movie because it's a tourguide on film, your kids will like the whole treasure hunt aspect, mostly good action scenes, and great acting(for the most part)and if you like it, then purchase or whatever you please.DVD bonus features:-Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending with optional director commentary-Opening Scene Animatic with optional director commentary-""National Treasure On Location""-""The Knights Templar"" featurette-""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" - Meet real life modern day treasure hunters-""Riley Poole's Decode This!"" - an interactive puzzle solving feature4 stars out of 5!The Opinionated One has Spoken",4,A Treasure hunt for the ages!,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2282,"['Wow', 'i', 'never', 'would', 'think', 'i', 'would', 'see', 'action', 'movie', 'history', 'lesson', 'free', 'tour', 'america', 'historical', 'places.The', 'Plot-Ben', 'Gates', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'been', 'told', 'childhood', 'grandfather', 'treasure', 'country', 'most', 'valuable', 'treasures', 'world', 'only', 'way', 'find', 'solve', 'hidden', 'riddles', 'are', 'national', 'documents', 'places', 'currency.Entailing', 'one', 'big', 'wild', 'giant', 'riddle', 'Ben', 'friends', 'country.BUT', 'Ben', 'Co.', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'are', 'treasure', 'ex-friends', 'are', 'willing', 'kill', 'get', 'greedy', 'hands', 'treasure.This', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'viewer', 'national', 'monuments', 'landmarks', 'many', 'cities', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', 'tour', 'guide', 'U.S.The', 'Action-This', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'shoot-em-up', 'explosion', 'type', 'action', 'movie', 'Disney', 'movie', 'hard', 'believe', 'gunshots', 'fired', 'movie', 'mostly', 'race', 'treasure', 'so', 'expect', 'see', 'alot', 'running', 'watch', 'Ben', 'Co', 'foes', 'play', 'hot', 'potato', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'treasure', 'map', 'back', 'treasure', 'negatives-Sometimes', 'movie', 'can', 'seem', 'little', 'unreal', 'i', 'think', 'impossible', 'steal', 'Declaration', 'O.I', 'action', 'scenes', 'when', 'Ben', 'hanging', 'swinging', 'van', 'back', 'door', 'van', 'motion', 'avoiding', 'oncoming', 'whole', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'country', 'seem', 'unreal', 'hey', 'thats', 'why', 'movie', 'right', 'Conclusion-I', 'urge', 'atleast', 'rent', 'movie', 'tourguide', 'film', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'whole', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'aspect', 'mostly', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'great', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'like', 'then', 'purchase', 'please.DVD', 'bonus', 'features', '-Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary-Opening', 'Scene', 'Animatic', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary-', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Location', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'featurette-', 'Treasure', 'Hunters', 'Revealed', 'Meet', 'real', 'life', 'modern', 'day', 'treasure', 'hunters-', 'Riley', 'Poole', 'Decode', 'interactive', 'puzzle', 'solving', 'feature4', 'stars', '5', 'Opinionated', 'One', 'Spoken']",National Treasure

As I have read from other reviews here, most people agree that while the film isn't a history lesson, it's a darn good time at the movies, and it should have been rated by critics by such. It's a popcorn flick, pure and simple, and in that context, it works flawlessly. It's tremendously entertaining, and it accomplishes that goal while being family-friendly (PG). The thing that always makes me laugh regarding most ""critics"" of film is that their reviews are essentially little more than a paragraph attempting to display the wit, knowledge, and general intelligence they believe they possess; they're in such constant defense of these self-inflated traits that they destroy any picture with a smidgeon of disregard for historical accuracy, while forgetting that movies are created, above all else, to entertain (unless they're labeled ""documentaries""). Do we care whether or not the founding fathers and the freemasons could have feasibly put an invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence? Should we be more concerned with whether or not the idea is even logistically fathomable or if the picture is entertaining? For my money, I want to see the entertaining picture (and so does 99% of the population)...and this is what the majority of critics fail to admit, in my opinion, in vigorously defending their ""intelligence"" in their ""reviews."" If I wanted to get out of work on a Friday to go and watch a depressing, miserable film with zero entertainment value simply because it happens to be historically accurate (hence, lacking sex appeal), I'd be on the watch for the sequel to ""The Fog of War."" However, I pay to see movies to be taken out of reality, and to have fun...just like everybody else, ultimately. I'm not ashamed to admit that I love this film, nor should the critics that publicly slandered it while probably watching it on a weekly basis in the privacy of their homes. Thus, I highly recommend it to any fan of, well, enjoying themselves via the watching of film, and I'd state that proof of the points I've made in this review will be made evident via the box office receipts of the upcoming sequel.

If you're looking for plausibility or realism, you're in the wrong place. But if you want a pop-corn thrill ride where no-one curses and there never seems to be any real danger, climb aboard.Jerry Bruckheimer, say what you want about him, knows how to make a movie go pop. The action here is almost non-stop, the jokes and asides are often clever, and the cast has enough chemistry that the non-action sequences don't drag. Jon Turteltaub directs with a steady hand, as the whole movie, at two hours, rushes by at lightening speed. It's a snappy enough pace that you don't question little things, like 200 year old ropes that still hold or being able to steal the Declaration of Independence.Nicholas Cage leads the likable band of thieves, but special note is given to Justin Bartha, who plays sidekick Riley, and to the early cameo by Christopher Plummer, who plays Cage's Grandfather at the beginning of the film. The both take otherwise easily forgettable roles and make them perfect. Cage plays BF Gates like a slightly less charming Indiana Jones (or a skinnier Tom Hanks inThe Da Vinci Code), both films providing the sanitized source material for ""National Treasure.""So relax, grab the popcorn and let the kiddies join you.

627313,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JN5E,Tim Janson,"[3, 3]","It seems like the main complaint that people have against National Treasure is that it's derivative of the best-selling Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.  Ok, I'll give you that.  But does that in and of itself make it a bad film?  How many films ARE totally original.  Taken on it's own merits National Treasure is a fun little treasure hunt film that really doesn't pretend to have aspirations of greatness.  Nick Cage, who I really like is Ben Gates, a historian/treasure hunter whose family has been maligned for decades for their search of the hidden treasure of the Templar Knights/Freemasons.  Now the legend of the Templar treasure is one rooted in real life which many treasure hunters have been looking for for centuries.  A bit more background on the Templars would have been nice but as history tells us, they were the world's first bankers and grew to incredible power...too powerful in fact for the church as Pope Clement accused them of heresy and they were hunted down, killed or imprisoned, and their treasures taken.  But it's been legend that many escaped and the Templars eventually formed the Freemasons and made their way to America, with much treasure still in hand.Anyway Gates and his sidekick Riley are betrayed by a fellow treasure hunter Ian (played by Lord of the Rings Sean Bean) and then its a race to see who can steal the Declaration of Independence first to use the hidden map on the back of that rare document.  Abigail Chase, a professor at the National Archives is caught up in the chase with Gates when he pulls off the elaborate and highly unprobable theft of the document with Ian and his cronies not far behind.  What follows is a DaVinci Code-esque whirlwind of clues and revelations as the trio go from spot to spot finding the next clues.  They eventually find their way to the home of Ben's father Patrick Gates played by Jon Voight who has always thought the search for the treasure was folly.Treasure builds and builds the curiousity and suspense in the race for the treasure and the one real weakness of the over two hour film is that it all wraps up nice and tidy within about ten minutes making the viewer feeling a bit unfulfilled.  yes it's pretty all improbable, especially the theft of the Declaration of Independence but if you suspend disbelief you can take it in as a fun little diversion.  Harvey Keitel is also on hand as an FBI agent who just happens to be a Freemason.The DVd extras are pretty light.  There's a very short alternate ending, some deleted scenes and a making of featurette.  Nothing to write home about.  Don't compare it to the Da Vinci Code.

627324,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JN5E,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Close on the heels of 'Pirates of the Carribbean,' Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer presents another tresure hunting romp starring Nicholas Cage.  The story, actions and characters are all formularic, and there is always a kind of feeling like, 'I have seen it before,' but I still find 'Natinonal Tresure' very entertaining if not very original.The film's plot might remind you of bestselling book 'The Da Vinci Code.'  Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates (what?) whose family have been trying to find the hidden treasure, and the clues of its whereabout are, Gates believes, encrypted in America's national monuments and archives such as The Declaration of Independence.  And one dollar note is, according to Gates, another crutial key.No one takes the screenplay seriously, and no one should.  This is a film made for fun, and in has fairly considerable entertainment value and its own charms.  See, Diane Kruger (much better than in 'Troy') is a curator of the National Archives, but she is there for providing love interest.  Justin Bartha (very good) is Benjamin's computer-wiz sidekick, but he is there for comic relief.  Harvey Keitel is an FBI agent and John Voight is Benjamin's father.  They both sneer at the ideas of our hero, but we know better, for we know who will win in the end.  We know that Sean Bean is doing the same kind of role again, with milder tone of menace.  But knowing that, I enjoyed the film pretty much.Seriously, the story often gets boring because of the contrived situations, and director Jon Turteltaub ('While You Were Sleeping') may not be the right choice for action adventure film.  However, though the actions themselves are not particularly innovative, they are still competently done, always providing something that might interest us -- like explosion, caper, car chase, and secret tunnels.  The difference is that they are milder than other actioners (it's Disney, you know).No matter what people say, co-producer Bruckheimer knows what he is doing, and the film is 100 % pure entertainment.

The critics were panning NATIONAL TREASURE before it even opened, doing their darnest to make the thing flop. But it didn't. NATIONAL TREASURE opened huge and left the majority of our nation's critical movie reviewers dumbfounded. Critics often forget that sometimes a movie is worth watching just because it's a movie-- a piece of mind candy to be enjoyed not analyzed. Every movie that's made doesn't have to have a strong message or industry-changing special effects or even a holeless plot. Solely on its on, NATIONAL TREASURE is an average picture. However, because of the enthusiasm of Cage (my favorite movie I've seen him in since THE FAMILY MAN) and Jon Turteltaub's wonderful direction, the film is able to raise above it's average status and become something a little more.NATIONAL TREASURE stars Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates. Gates is the last in a long line of a family of infamous U.S. historians who are considered crackpots.  At the birth of the United States, Gates' ancestor was intrusted with a clue that would lead to a National Treasure. The National Treasure was a treasure that had been collected and gathered through the ages, preserving not only material wealth, but wealth of knowledge.  The treasure had been protected first by the Knights Templar and then their future heirs, the Free Masons. Anyway, Ben succeeds in located a huge artifact and another clue--something none of his ancestors had been able to do.  However, he is betrayed by his benefactor and is left to die in an explosion.  Ben and his partner find a secret passage for safety and survive. And then the game is on.  It's a race to steal the Declaration of Independence and find the map that's on the back.

Add a theory that those clues lead to a treasure hidden for centuries and protected by a secret order (a la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). Add a sunken ship in the Antarctic (a la Titanic), with a smoking pipe still on board whose stem has raised figures which, when inked up, can print 6 lines of verse that point to the Declaration of Independence as a possible source of clues. Add a scheme to steal that document (a la Mission Impossible). Add people thinking you're crazy because you're the only one who believes in your theory (a la Conspiracy Theory). Add a code written on the back of the Declaration of Independence that corresponds to the individual letters in letters written by Benjamin Franklin (a la A Beautiful Mind). Add magic glasses found in Independence Hall that allow the wearer to see images on the back of the Declaration...and on it goes. Improbability stacked upon improbability, and all borrowed from other films.Now add a middle age Nicolas Cage who's being asked to play an action hero. It boggles the mind.I really wanted to like this film. I was expecting high adventure along the lines of Indiana Jones meets Sherlock Holmes, as I think a lot of people were. But the producers seem more interested in being the first to bring a Da Vinci Code type film to the screen than in producing a top-notch piece of entertainment. This is filmmaking reduced down to comic book standards. It is filmmaking by the numbers.These filmmakers, and Hollywood in general, are not interested in giving us something that resembles reality, or is even believable.

""National Treasure"" falls into the latter category. ""National Treasure"" is a fun, quick paced film with a nice performance from Nicholas Cage that tips its hat to ""Raiders of the Los Ark"" and other adventure movies without borrowing from them. Turtletaub has made a movie that's fun for the whole family and doesn't resort to the cheap tricks that a lot of other adventure movies use to make its point.There's gold in them there hills and the founding fathers know where the treasure is buried. Cage plays Ben Gates who is in pursuit of a mythical treasure. Gates and his family have been looking for this treasure for years and he now believes that the final clue--a map--may be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Unfortunately, Gates must compete against his former backer the ruthless Ian Howe (Sean Bean ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Troy"", ""Goldeneye"")to obtain the information he needs.Filled with marvelous supporting turns from Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, Harvey Keitel ""National Teasure"" despite its PG rating (more for violence and scary images)is great fun for kids and parents alike. While there's enough plot holes to drive a truck through and a number of implausible moments, director Jon Turteltaub recognizes (as Hitchcock did) that if the plot is involving, credible on the surface and breezy fun audience will overlook any minor flaws in a film. He does a great job directing the movie keeping the quick pace and witty dialogue flying.Extras include an alternate ending which didn't quite work for the movie. There's both a commentary from the director and a introduction by Turtletaub as well. We also see an animatic (a computer generated animation that suggests what the final scene will look like)for the opening sequence again with a brief intro by Turtletaub. The 12 minute featurette gives plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of one of the best action sequences. Most of the rest of featurette focuses on talking heads with the director, producer and actors discussing the production of the movie what they hoped to achieve. It's essentially a promo reel for the movie. There's also about 8 minutes of deleted scenes included as well. At the end of each extra there are clues given that will lead you to a ""treasure"" on the DVD. Once you have the master code you can click on the book in the corner to submit the secret key and get access to your ""treasure"". There's also a couple of additional worthwhile featurettes including one on ""The Knights of Templar"" and one entitled ""Treasure Hunters Revealed"" which I haven't had time to watch as of yet.""National Treasure"" provides a fun diversion for fans of fast paced action films and, unlike most films from that genre, it's not cheesy action junk.

Where Indiana Jones is the big draw, the one that has the longest lines of people waiting for the experience, National Treasure is the slightly less exciting ride, the one with shorter lines.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the new movie was fine, it just lacked the edge-of-your-seat thrills of the best genre pix like Indy Jones.

Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type character, accompanied by his partner Justin Bartha and romantic interest Diane Kruger, the latter an historical document scholar who gets dragged into the crazy happenings.THE STORY: Cage feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis Sean Bean. The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Cage successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously ""get the girl"" as well?""National Treasure"" put a big grin on my face throughout its entire 2-hour run time. Like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Still, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad by-product, no?A handful of miscellaneous items:Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in ""Troy,"" is super sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.The score is ultra-modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.The protagonists are all supremely likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.The chases are thrilling.The film was shot on location in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.Jon Voight plays Cage's father.Like ""Raiders"" this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore.CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- ""National Treasure"" was a huge 2004 hit with audiences. This proves that critics like Ebert and (especially) Roeper see WAY, WAY too many movies. Heck, they can't even lighten-up and enjoy a truly thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick.

So it's a race between the two to gather the pieces of the puzzle and locate the treasure.This movie is a great family movie to be enjoyed by young kids to the great grandparent.
