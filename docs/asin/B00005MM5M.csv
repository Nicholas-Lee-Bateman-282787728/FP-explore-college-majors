666334,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B00005MM5M,Ace,"[0, 0]","When faced with a disease which wastes the body while compelling the victim to eat human flesh, a group of afflicted women huddle together to survive. DEAD CREATURES provides viewers with an alternative to the usual Zombie fare, in that the ""Zombies"" appear more or less like normal people accept that they crave human flesh. Yep, they even talk...a lot. I personally don't care for talking Zombies as they are not as threatening or dare I say, ""realistic"". The horror element is diminished when Zombies babble. Despite the claims of the director, these are not really Zombies as they are NOT the undead, rather, they are living people with an odd disease which is transmitted by the bite of an infected person. As implied in the film, those afflicted will eventually die unless they are put down by their support group. These are not rage type Zombies, nor are they Romero Shamblers or Snyder Runners. Where the disease has been allowed to run its course, we do have a fair to good looking stage 3 Zombie, though they are too weak to hunt humans, (darn). In the special features the Director stated that he aimed this film at those who were tired of comedic horror, adding that he wished to provide an alternative to the Zombie film. On that count he succeeded, however, DEAD CREATURES is actually a rather ponderous, tedious film, though occasionally punctuated by some decent gore. This is basically a dialogue driven picture where the women spend most of their time sitting around their apartment talking and smoking pot. What kill scenes there are remain unconvincing and devoid of any style or slaughter appeal. The few gore scenes presented are well done, accept that what the women ate would not have fed a church mouse. The actors required some strident direction here, but alas such was not the case. Although originally slotted for a micro budget, DEAD CREATURES was made for a paltry $70,000.00, and unfortunately it shows. As I have stated before, what Zombie fans want most of all is CARNAGE. End of story. This ain't Shakespeare. Most fans don't care about social messages in these type of films, (unless they are artsy fartsy types). If you want that, then watch PONTYPOOL, (oops! I mean PONTYPOO). Why film makers overtly strive for sending us a social message in a Zombie film is beyond me. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear people. This film has a number of social messages, but I could care less to discuss them. The fact that our loved ones come after us when dead should be creepy enough. Competent direction should draw the viewer in, which would seriously add to the creep factor. Unfortunately, this rarely happens in the modern Horror film. I will give the Director credit for attempting something different while avoiding the dreaded horror comedy route. Spot on! I also enjoyed the gore that was presented, however, there is no escaping the fact that this is a boring movie with minimal Zombie chow time. I really wanted to like this film, however, this is a marginal outing at best.
