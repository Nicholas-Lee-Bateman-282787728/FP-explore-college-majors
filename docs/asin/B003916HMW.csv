1333374,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B003916HMW,Brent Butler,"[15, 15]","I've had a great respect for Chet Atkins ability to play the guitar since I first heard my parent's Chet LP when I was 9 or 10 years old. Chet has a unique sounding style, and can make guitars do things that I've just never heard anyone else do. You can tell when you see joint appearances that other great musicians feel the same way. When I saw the concert coming up, I was looking forward to it.The concert turned out to be a surprise in a very pleasant way. It wasn't really a Chet Atkins concert, although he certainly got his time in the limelight with solo and duo performances. It was really a tribute to his behind the scenes work over the decades as a talent manager and record producer. The concert was filled with a continuing stream of top stars that Chet had groomed over the years. The performances were mostly stars like the Everly Brothers, Waylon Jennings, and more. I won't spoil the surprises here, although if you've read the promo material above, you already know the surprise performers. And the stars aren't all on the stage. Keep a sharp eye on the crowd when the camera pans to the audience. Its full of big time music stars.The music played in this concert was of incredibly high quality. All the performers, both musicians and singers, are top notch. Not knowing who was coming on next as we watched, we were continually surprised and delighted by the appearance of the next performer. There is no question: we considered this was a real treat, and will watch it many more times over the years to come.",5,Highly enjoyable concert,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1530,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'great', 'respect', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'ability', 'play', 'guitar', 'first', 'heard', 'parent', 'Chet', 'LP', 'when', 'was', '9', '10', 'years', 'old', 'Chet', 'unique', 'sounding', 'style', 'can', 'make', 'guitars', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'just', 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'else', 'do', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'see', 'joint', 'appearances', 'other', 'great', 'musicians', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'When', 'saw', 'concert', 'coming', 'up', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'it.The', 'concert', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'surprise', 'very', 'pleasant', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'concert', 'certainly', 'got', 'time', 'limelight', 'solo', 'duo', 'performances', 'was', 'really', 'tribute', 'scenes', 'work', 'decades', 'talent', 'manager', 'record', 'producer', 'concert', 'was', 'filled', 'continuing', 'stream', 'top', 'stars', 'Chet', 'had', 'groomed', 'years', 'performances', 'were', 'mostly', 'stars', 'Everly', 'Brothers', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprises', 'here', ""'ve"", 'read', 'promo', 'material', 'already', 'know', 'surprise', 'performers', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'stage', 'Keep', 'sharp', 'eye', 'crowd', 'when', 'camera', 'audience', 'full', 'big', 'time', 'music', 'stars.The', 'music', 'played', 'concert', 'was', 'incredibly', 'high', 'quality', 'performers', 'musicians', 'singers', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Not', 'knowing', 'who', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'watched', 'were', 'continually', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'appearance', 'next', 'performer', 'question', 'considered', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'years', 'come']",Chet Atkins Certified Guitar Player As seen on PBS

The music is that good, the playing that great.So I can't really say too much about the DVD. I saw this on PBS, so enjoyed watching the playing. But sometimes the visuals can distract from the performances. So the CD is a good thing and allows you to concentrate on just the pure joy of well performed and arranged music played by masters at their craft.And oh, what masters they are.",4,Some really great playing goin' on here,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,487,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'got', 'CD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'kept', 'music', 'good', 'playing', 'great.So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'DVD', 'saw', 'PBS', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'playing', 'visuals', 'can', 'distract', 'performances', 'CD', 'good', 'thing', 'concentrate', 'just', 'pure', 'joy', 'well', 'performed', 'arranged', 'music', 'played', 'masters', 'craft.And', 'oh', 'what', 'are']",Chet Atkins Certified Guitar Player As seen on PBS
