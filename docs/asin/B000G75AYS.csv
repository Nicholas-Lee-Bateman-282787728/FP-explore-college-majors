999251,AMDWL7KIPD5G2,B000G75AYS,Dan Dean,"[0, 0]","I heard that Sinbad had a new DVD special out recently, calledSinbad: Where U Been?. It was WAY better than I expected, and it had my friends and I rolling with laughter. After that 5-star set, I was compelled to check out some of his older stuff. Again, I was very surprised. This DVD was much better than I had ever recalled Sinbad being, back in the early 90's, when he was big. Maybe I just didn't ""get him"" back then or maybe his stuff was just too heavily edited for TV, which is very possible. Either way, this special brings us back to Sinbad's childhood, reminding us how things were, and I found it very relevant even though I am much younger than he is. It had tons of really good laughs, and he does it clean! I don't care one way or another if a comic curses or not, but it was pretty impressive that he was this good without needing to shock the audience. I was continuously blown away by his sharp observations of the world around him.

This one wasn't very funny to me. It relied on SO MANY ""Remember the '70s"" jokes to the point of not really being jokes. They were more like observations. There's a way to do it without making us feel like we're looking through a photo album. When he went into incidents about the mothers mimicking fathers, it was funny. I even laughed about the ""act like you lost your mind"" joke, which made me want to watch ""House Party."" I cracked up laughing during the jokes about diets because no matter how old you are, you could relate to stuff like that. I think when he stopped relying on '70s days, the comedy picked up, but as soon as he referred back to it, there was too much reflecting and not enough funny moments.
