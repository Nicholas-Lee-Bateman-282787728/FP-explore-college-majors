767751,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,B0000AR7RR,"Elaine Campbell ""Desert Dweller""","[0, 0]","This film portrays a lovely story about a group of English Springer Spaniel strays that have a remarkable healing power and the freedom to use it because they are being kept hidden in the custodian's quarters of a hospital (away from the town dog catcher) by the son of a physician (ably played by Ted Shackelford of Knots Landing fame) and assistant to the hospital administrator (Kate Jackson, former Angel, now competent actress).  This family of three has only recently relocated to Ohio from Colorado, which the boy through much of the film misses and wants to return there.While it is a light and cheery film, it is to be taken in all seriousness because of the quality of the performances and the superb and sensitive direction given by actor/writer/director Craig Clyde, who has also directed such films as The Derby Stallion, The Christmas Stallion and A Christmas Wish, the latter two which he also wrote.Most of the cast members seem to be New York trained and highly respected:  Wayne Rogers, Stacy Keach, Rue McClanahan (in a charming performance), Josh Hutcherson (who plays the young boy and has gone on to a successful acting career as an adult), among others.  There are simply no bad, or even mediocre, performances in this film.Special mention should be made of the focused performance by Talbot Perry Simons as the kindly but dutiful dog catcher who received his training at the Lee Strasberg Institute.  In 2009 the independent filmStill the Drumsthat he wrote, directed, performed in and composed a song for won the following awards at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival:  Best Movie, Best Directorial Debut, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best New Song - ""Nobody's Fault But Mine the P.T.S.D. Blues.""  Pretty impressive!These actors bring this warm and charming story to full life.Perhaps there was a time frame limit, but the film's ending seemed to be rushed and sequential happy endings were depicted in one situation after another.  Of course with such an upbeat children's story certainly no one wants it to end miserably, but on the other hand the ending seemed to be too sketchy, too conveniently tied up, albeit rosily.  Particularly in the final segment I would have liked to have viewed the action worked out to fulfillment, rather than an ""on the way"" situation with puzzling, unexplained factors.Nevertheless, this is an exceptional film of a magical tale abounding with sterling talent.",5,Children's Story Skillfully Adapted for Film,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,2451,"['film', 'lovely', 'story', 'group', 'English', 'Springer', 'Spaniel', 'have', 'remarkable', 'healing', 'power', 'freedom', 'use', 'are', 'being', 'kept', 'hidden', 'custodian', 'quarters', 'hospital', 'away', 'town', 'dog', 'catcher', 'son', 'physician', 'ably', 'played', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'fame', 'assistant', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'former', 'Angel', 'now', 'competent', 'actress', 'family', 'three', 'only', 'recently', 'relocated', 'Ohio', 'Colorado', 'boy', 'much', 'film', 'misses', 'return', 'light', 'cheery', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'seriousness', 'quality', 'performances', 'superb', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'given', 'actor/writer/director', 'Craig', 'Clyde', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'such', 'films', 'Derby', 'Stallion', 'Christmas', 'Stallion', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Wish', 'latter', 'two', 'also', 'wrote.Most', 'cast', 'members', 'seem', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'trained', 'highly', 'respected', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'charming', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'gone', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'adult', 'others', 'are', 'simply', 'bad', 'even', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'film.Special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'focused', 'performance', 'Talbot', 'Perry', 'Simons', 'kindly', 'dutiful', 'dog', 'catcher', 'who', 'received', 'training', 'Lee', 'Strasberg', 'Institute', '2009', 'independent', 'filmStill', 'Drumsthat', 'wrote', 'directed', 'performed', 'composed', 'song', 'won', 'following', 'awards', 'New', 'York', 'International', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Video', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Movie', 'Best', 'Directorial', 'Debut', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'New', 'Song', 'Nobody', 'Fault', 'Mine', 'P.T.S.D', 'Blues', 'Pretty', 'impressive', 'actors', 'bring', 'warm', 'charming', 'story', 'full', 'life.Perhaps', 'was', 'time', 'frame', 'limit', 'film', 'ending', 'seemed', 'be', 'rushed', 'sequential', 'happy', 'endings', 'were', 'depicted', 'one', 'situation', 'course', 'upbeat', 'children', 'story', 'certainly', 'one', 'end', 'miserably', 'other', 'hand', 'ending', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'sketchy', 'too', 'conveniently', 'tied', 'up', 'rosily', 'Particularly', 'final', 'segment', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'viewed', 'action', 'worked', 'out', 'fulfillment', 'rather', 'way', 'situation', 'puzzling', 'unexplained', 'factors.Nevertheless', 'exceptional', 'film', 'magical', 'tale', 'abounding', 'sterling', 'talent']",N/A

It's actually pretty cute, thanks to the good work of filmmakers Craig Clyde, Bryce Filmore and Ray Tremblay.  I'm not a big fan of the ""Executive Producers"" behind the film, and this made it impossible for me to enjoy the movie.  Now, Amazon is making it impossible for me to change my 1-star ranking up to a more deserved level of 4-stars.  Apparently, you can re-edit your write-up, but never can change your score of stars (sorry to Ray, Craig and Bryce!!).

Sure, it's predictable and filled with every movie cliche of this type of film.  But it's heart is so big and in the right place, one can't help but feel a little fuzzy after watching it.  The dogs are irresistibly cuddly and little Josh Hutcherson is so believable as the little boy, the movie manages to entertain in spite of its sugary delivery.  I've always enjoyed watching Kate Jackson since her days on ""Dark Shadows"" and although she isn't given a lot to do in this film, her radiance remains.  KNOTS LANDING'S Ted Shackelford and MIKE HAMMER'S Stacy Keach likewise are serviceable in their roles, and Rue McClanahan makes a convincing lonely old rich lady.

The idea is about a boy who has to give away some puppies, and in the meantime when the puppies (or their mother) visit hospital patients, the patients miraculously get better.  The reason I only give it four stars is that the film doesn't stay focused on that idea and follow individual stories for each puppy & patient, but gets sidetracked with other characters like a doctor (Wayne Rogers) who has little to do with the main story, a janitor (Stacy Keach), and a dog catcher.
