Now a lot of people bashed Mr. Hasselhoff for being in the show, but without him we wouldnt have this DVD to purchase.  The suporting cast is excellent and Mr Hasselhoff can sometimes hold his own, but for people wanting to see a broadway actor/singer in the lead role, they will be quite disappointed.  It would have been much better if they made a DVD of the road show since some of the better songs have shown up in that production.  The DVD offers nothing in the way of extras that I saw.

His acting is pathetic and he tends to worbble while holding notes. #2 This is the inferior Broadway production. Why they chose to film this production I'll never know. It's a badly butchard version of J&amp;H. They should have filmed the US Tour. If you've never seen the tour though, you won't miss anything with this videoNow here's the good. Hasselhoff's Hyde is actually very good. He looks truely insane and sings certain parts in really different, really cool ways. The rest of the cast is brilliant. I don't think they could have casted them better if they tried.

The musical itself was very good. Dark and very scary. The murder scenes were brutal. Hyde is most certainly a chracter that I would not want to meet in a dark alley at night. The struggle that the good Dr. Jkyll goes through I think best represents the struggle that man has between his two natures. The good nature and the evil nature that is within all of us. Its so sad for Jkyll in the end. ( I wont spoil it for those who havn't seen this musical.) I loved the music, facade and dangerouse game being my two favorites. Facade I like because it kind of has a dark truth to it. we all wear masks to hide what we truly are. (some more than others.) Dangerouse game I don't know why this song it so good but it just is. Darkly sensual and erotic.The acting and singing for this filmed version of the show. Well, let me start off by asking why did they ever cast someone like david hasselhoff? No offense but he cant sing or act. I was cringing through out every time he opened his mouth. He wasn't as bad as some, but I can't stand his voice.

This is one of those shows that requires great performances to pull it off.  Unfortunately Mr. Hasselhoff is unable to deliver the type of performance necessary to make this show work.  If you saw this show on Broadway (like I did - twice) with the original cast (Cuccioli, Evans, Eder, Noll), then you know exactly what I mean.  They made this show the hit it was.  What a shame that they record Broadway Shows for perpetuity not with the original and usually BEST cast - but with the last and usually WEAKEST cast.  Sexton and Rivette are much stronger than Hasselhoff, but not enough to compensate for his profound shortcomings.  Why wouldn't they call back the original cast just for the recording of this video?  Why?  Linda Eder's husband (Frank Wildhorn) wrote the show.  Why wouldn't he want his wife's performance captured on video?  Perhaps this recording was part of Hasselhoff's agreement to do the show in the first place?  Lucky for us.

669232,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005NKSV,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[19, 41]","Developed by composer Frank Wildhorn and lyricist Leslie Bricusse, JEKYLL &amp; HYDE proved a popular ticket at Houston's Alley Theatre in 1990--and after a concept album, several more regional productions, and numerous rewrites it opened in New York's Plymouth Theatre in 1997.Although critics admired several of the performers, they did not admire the show itself, and audience reaction was very mixed.  Canny marketing and hardcore fans kept the doors open, but by 2001 the situation became acute, and television star and pop singer David Hasselhoff was cast in a last ditch effort to stem the tide.Many of the show's fans complain that Hasselhoff killed the play, which closed not long after this 2001 cable-television version captured his performance.  At the time, Hasselhoff had little stage experience, and his weakness shows.  But for all Hasselhoff's awkwardness (which is now and then unintentionally hilarious), the real problem with the show was the show itself.JEKYLL &amp; HYDE is certainly one of the most derivative shows in recent memory, and Wildhorn borrows so liberally from other musicals that it's a wonder he wasn't sued.  The show's opening sounds remarkably like the opening of LES MISERABLES; &quot;Facade&quot; might have been lifted directly from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA; &quot;In His Eyes&quot; is akin to a watered down &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; from CHESS.In each case, Wildhorn also waters down the musical ideas he has borrowed, and the result is light pop pure and simple.  Indeed, the show's centerpiece, &quot;This Is The Moment,&quot; sounds exactly like the sort of thing Debbie Boone might have recorded twenty years ago.  Nor is there any salvation in the lyrics, which range from tepid to flatly misguided, or the script, which is remarkably unimaginative.Not only do the musical, lyrical, and script ideas argue with each other, they argue with the visual style of the show itself.  It seems very strange to hear something that sounds very much like 1980s American pop music and contemporary slang emerge from men in frocktail coats and women wearing bustles.  The show looks quite a bit like an up-side SWEENY TODD, but it sounds very much like something your local high school might do.  It's all very awkward.The supporting cast is quite good here, but they're fighting an uphill battle against both Hasselhoff and the show itself, and the only surprising thing about JEKYLL &amp; HYDE is that it lasted on the stage for as long as it did.  Unless you're a diehard fan of either Hasselhoff or the show itself, you'd really do better to purchase a cast recording from one of the many shows it mimics than bother with this DVD.  Two stars for the production values and the supporting cast, but that's all.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",2,A Pastiche of Borrowed Ideas &amp; Awkward Concepts,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,2771,"['Developed', 'composer', 'Frank', 'Wildhorn', 'lyricist', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'JEKYLL', 'amp', 'HYDE', 'proved', 'popular', 'ticket', 'Houston', 'Alley', 'Theatre', '1990', 'concept', 'album', 'several', 'more', 'regional', 'productions', 'numerous', 'rewrites', 'opened', 'New', 'York', 'Plymouth', 'Theatre', '1997.Although', 'critics', 'admired', 'several', 'performers', 'did', 'not', 'admire', 'show', 'audience', 'reaction', 'was', 'very', 'mixed', 'Canny', 'marketing', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'kept', 'doors', 'open', '2001', 'situation', 'became', 'acute', 'television', 'star', 'pop', 'singer', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'was', 'cast', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'stem', 'tide.Many', 'show', 'fans', 'complain', 'Hasselhoff', 'killed', 'play', 'closed', 'not', 'long', '2001', 'cable-television', 'version', 'captured', 'performance', 'time', 'Hasselhoff', 'had', 'little', 'stage', 'experience', 'weakness', 'shows', 'Hasselhoff', 'awkwardness', 'now', 'then', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'real', 'problem', 'show', 'was', 'show', 'itself.JEKYLL', 'amp', 'HYDE', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'derivative', 'shows', 'recent', 'memory', 'Wildhorn', 'borrows', 'so', 'liberally', 'other', 'musicals', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'sued', 'show', 'opening', 'remarkably', 'opening', 'LES', 'MISERABLES', 'quot', 'Facade', 'quot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'directly', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'akin', 'watered', 'down', 'quot', 'Know', 'Him', 'So', 'Well', 'quot', 'CHESS.In', 'case', 'Wildhorn', 'also', 'down', 'musical', 'ideas', 'borrowed', 'result', 'light', 'pop', 'pure', 'simple', 'Indeed', 'show', 'centerpiece', 'quot', 'Moment', 'quot', 'exactly', 'sort', 'thing', 'Debbie', 'Boone', 'might', 'have', 'recorded', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'there', 'salvation', 'lyrics', 'range', 'tepid', 'flatly', 'misguided', 'script', 'remarkably', 'unimaginative.Not', 'only', 'do', 'musical', 'lyrical', 'script', 'ideas', 'argue', 'other', 'argue', 'visual', 'style', 'show', 'very', 'strange', 'hear', 'something', 'very', 'much', '1980s', 'American', 'pop', 'music', 'contemporary', 'slang', 'emerge', 'men', 'frocktail', 'coats', 'women', 'wearing', 'bustles', 'show', 'quite', 'bit', 'up-side', 'SWEENY', 'TODD', 'very', 'much', 'something', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'might', 'do', 'very', 'awkward.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'here', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'uphill', 'battle', 'Hasselhoff', 'show', 'only', 'surprising', 'thing', 'JEKYLL', 'amp', 'HYDE', 'lasted', 'stage', 'as', 'long', 'did', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'Hasselhoff', 'show', ""'d"", 'really', 'do', 'better', 'purchase', 'cast', 'recording', 'one', 'many', 'shows', 'mimics', 'bother', 'DVD', 'Two', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'supporting', 'cast', 'all.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

It became my favorite musical, more so than Phantom, Les Miz, Aida, Rent, you get the idea.  There's just something about it.  I'll tell you what it is: the story, the music, the talent, the emotion, the music, the music, the music, and....the music.  I love the music!! And much more so when the actors can sing it! And sing it well!  And the cast for this DVD did, for the most part.I was afraid to watch this DVD, because I knew I had to compare it to the original Broadway cast recording, and the performance I saw, but I was pleasantly surprised.  David Hasselhoff is pretty good, but I would have been more excited to see Sebastian Bach.  He's cuter.I was VERY impressed by Andrea and how she flawlessly played and sang Emma.  She has a great voice too.  At first I was kinda annoyed with Coleen's singing voice - sooo much higher and different than Linda Eder's (who is truly talented, and whose voice is gorgeous), but when she began hitting the hard notes and showing her skill, I warmed up to her.  Her acting was good too.This is a great musical, so obviously I'd like anything to do with it.  And having the musical on hand to watch whenever I want, with a perfect view, is hard to resist.

I had an absolute BLAST seeing Sebastian Bach rip through the entire show. Sebastian has a phenomenal voice: he is !EDWARD HYDE! to the utmost! The only thing that I cannot fault Sebastian on is that as he really did not have an opportunity to truly ACT prior to JEKYLL &amp; HYDE, his portrayal as HENRY JEKYLL lacked the polish and poise that an upper-middle class doctor should have... But, given the time, and the opportunity, I foresee an extremely talented actor. BUT!!! The reason that Sebastian ROCKED as Edward Hyde, is that that was his (Sebastian's) persona on stage as a heavy-metal rocker. As I never really watched either &quot;Knight-Rider&quot; or &quot;Baywatch&quot;, I am in no position to say 'yea' or 'nay' to David's acting ability. I was in NYC, and I purchased a ticket to see David as I was curious about how he would do... I was pleasantly surprised! He can indeed act, and his voice is very good! It was a life-long dream of David's to be on Broadway, and in a musical, and I think he more than acquitted himself!

669235,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005NKSV,Hazen B Markoe,"[13, 16]","Much has been made of the fact that TV star David Hasselhoff was playing the title roles in JEKYLL AND HYDE, the hit Broadway musical based on the classic horror story of the doctor who brings out his evil self through the use of chemicals.  Some critics thought he was a lightweight and a stiff pretty boy, however they seem a little off the mark on this one.  Aside from the occasionally odd pop-stylings in his singing and a touch of hamminess as Hyde, Hasselhoff does a fairly solid job.  He holds his own quite nicely in what, despite his top billing, turns out to be a well-balanced production.  Opera singer George Merritt is quite sympathetic as Jekyll's friend and lawyer, Utterson, although he doesn't get to show off his voice much in mainly a character role.  Barrie Ingham provides warmth as Sir Danvers Carew, while Andrea Rivette is a winsome Emily.  While not on a par as Linda Eder, who created the role, Coleen Sexton makes a sexy turn as the ill-fated Lucy.  The rest of the cast is just as solid, handling their songs with skill.  The 10 camera set-up does a wonderful job of bringing the production up close, as well showing off some of the fast-paced staging.  Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story is not your typical plotline for musical theatre, but JEKYLL AND HYDE is a fairly successful attempt, and a top-notch DVD capture of a Broadway show.

669242,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,B00005NKSV,Jim Jr,"[7, 10]","Where is Chuck Wagner when he is badly needed. Mr. Wagner was the first Jekyll/Hyde in the world premiere in Huston and starred in the touring version. He was magnificant and sent chills through the audience. I have never heard anyone sing &quot;This Is the Moment&quot; as effectivally and I have all the recordings. His acting was unforgetable. So it was with this superb performance in mind that I watched David Hasselhoff attempt to play the part. He was pale indeed by comparison.Mr. Hasselhoff is supposed to be a major record seller in Europe, if so, there must be a tremendous amount of electronic work done on his voice. He simply does not have a theatrical voice. This is particularly evident on the beautiful &quot;This Is The Moment&quot; which sounds very weak and not at all memorable in his rendition. As an actor, he is more effective as Hyde than as Dr. Jekyll. But it is a fact that villains are easier and more fun to play than the straight forward leads. Unfortunately, Mr. Hasselhoff is very stiff in his movements and simply looked OLD as Jekyll. He was probably the reason that the film was made, so we have to thank him for that, but he is far from the ideal choice.The show itself has had a number of versions. When I saw the touring version, some of us were talking to the orchestra leader during the intermission and he stated that what we were seeing was a bit different from the Broadway show. The main change seemed to be that the wonderful song, &quot;No One Knows Who I Am&quot; for Lucy was replaced by &quot;Bring On The Men&quot;.Andrea Rivette, who is on the DVD, was also Emma in this tour. She was wonderful then and on the disk. She makes a believable love interest for Jekyll.The supporting cast, as has been mentioned in most of the other reviews,is uniformally excellent on the DVD. Coleen Sexton as the unfortunate bar girl Lucy is worth the price of the DVD alone. For a 20 year old (as she is listed in the cast portion of the &quot;extras&quot;) she gives a performance with memorable depth. She is also knock out beautiful!It is wonderful that Broadway shows are being preserved on DVD, even with less than exciting leads. At least we have a record of what the Broadway show was. Anyone serious about musical theater should add this show to their collection.

The beautiful songs, the gothic romance story and the killer performances from Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder, and Christine Noll. All had the most exquisite voices I have ever heard, and each song was sung with such strength and emotion. The videotaped version is very high quality and has done a tremendous job at bringing the stage version to the small screen. The songs still are brilliant including Take Me As I Am, Someone Like You, This is the Moment, A New Life, and the stunning duet In His Eyes. Andrea Rivette as Emma is very good. Acting is good and she has a lovely voice, but she brings nothing new to the role that Christine Noll created. She seems bored. Colleen Sexton as Lucy the whore is certainly sexy and has quite a marvelous voice, but the songs Someone like You and A New Life were written for Linda Eder(the best female vocalist ever!) and she does not come even close to her. Her acting is very strong but here voice is not mature enough to hit the high notes and she sometimes comes across as screaming(however, her rendition of A New Life is simply marvelous). In His Eyes by Lucy and Emma is and has remained the highlight song of the show. Both actresses sing this song with alot of energy and emotion and it sent chills up my back. David Hasslehoff is bad. His acting is boring and his singing is flat and forced. He is definetly not trained properly. I'm sure David would have been better in a different role but Jekyll and Hyde is too diffucult a role for a newcomer to handle and he tries and tries but faild, although I do give him props for tackling such a hard role to play. I can't understand why Frank Wildhorn would allow them to tape this without the original cast especially his wife Linda Eder who should have been called to do the taping. All that aside....Jekyll and Hyde is still a thrill to watch and I will continue to watch it over and over again. I'm not saying the cast(except David H) is bad, they are all amazing but they lack the excitment and power that the Orig Bway cast had.

669244,A2HVC1IXR56PPS,B00005NKSV,J. McCormick,"[3, 3]","I must confess to being a Jekyll & Hyde fan, sort of. It is a show that I think has a lot of potential, but it is potential that has never been fully realized. It has the distinct feel of an unfinished product, even though it's been around for a decade or so and was conceived over two decades ago. The show has changed quite a bit over time -- the original concept recording was extremely pop-sounding. The complete work recording was the closest to what the show should have been -- exploring more of what Jekyll's experiment was actually doing to him and why he kept on doing it -- but the pacing wasn't good. The broadway incarnation did away with a lot of the more intellectual aspects of the show and made the show more of a campy horror show by overexaggerating the differences between Jekyll and Hyde, but it had much better pacing.Hyde, I believe, needs to be an almost sympathetic character for the show to be really effective. For example, when he is killing the members of the hospital's board of governors, we all know what he is doing is wrong, but we can understand why he is doing it. To that end, I think the broadway show's version of Dangerous Game as almost a rape scene destroys this and just makes him an overdone villain, not because the rape is an inconceivable act but because he started out causing physical damage to Lucy. I think it weakens the story to try to put Hyde's evil forth as simply causing random physical violence for no apparent reason.So, that said, this DVD captures the broadway incarnation. I will say that I have more respect for David Hasselhoff for having taken on this role. He has some genuinely good moments (The Way Back). Unfortunately, he has a number of really bad acting moments and times when he is just not with the music (Alive, Dangerous Game, Confrontation) that greatly diminish the overall quality here. One thing I will say in Hasselhoff's favor is that he is WAY, WAY, WAY better than Sebastian Bach in the role (I had the misfortune of seeing the show live with Bach in it), but unfortunately this is really just an indication of how bad Bach was rather than an indication of how good Hasselhoff was.The rest of the cast is pretty good, although none of them really shines. I didn't like George Merritt especially much on the DVD, but I had the opportunity to see him live in the same role and thought he was very good.Overall, this one is hard to recommend unless you are definitely a fan of the musical, and even then it may be hard to get past some of this one's weak points. For some reason, even though this is a broadway production, it feels like it was filmed at a high school.

669247,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005NKSV,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[62, 67]","I'm suspecting that there are two types of people who are approaching this DVD, a filmed version of the stage production of ""Jekyll & Hyde"".  One, someone familiar with the show--perhaps saw it and liked it or has the soundtrack--and wants to check out this variation.  Or two, someone discovering it anew.  It tempts me to write two reviews because while I love ""Jekyll & Hyde"", it's slightly unfortunate that this is the production most people will get a chance to judge.So let me preface this by saying that I really am a fan of this show.  Some people consider ""Jekyll"" sort of a ""Phantom-lite"".  I, myself, have never been the biggest supporter of ""Phantom of the Opera"".  It's fine, full of bombast, but hardly the revolutionary experience that people give it credit for.  ""Jekyll"" does play to similar themes, but has a stronger overall soundtrack.  Instead of a couple of showstoppers like ""Phantom"", ""Jekyll"" is filled with memorable power ballads.  Not the most complicated show musically, it is very accessible.  And when you have great singers, these simpler and emotionally charged songs become pop opera and quite moving.So, without hesitation, I recommend the original Broadway Cast recording!!!  Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder and Christiane Noll are superb.  You couldn't hope for better.But here's the problem with this DVD, it's not this great cast--NO, the star is David Hasselhoff.  So you see my problem, don't you?  Look, I'm not going to be unkind--it's an easy target.  Let's just say this.  If you're a fan of the show, he doesn't completely ruin it.  And it's not like there are any other versions to add to your collections.  If you are new to the show, I'm still recommending it provisionally.  I wish there were another option.  If you like the show, though--and I think you will--please rush over and buy the 1997 Cast recording.  Treat yourself to how ""Jekyll & Hyde"" should really sound.

Because the cast puts all there diafram and sing with all they got, they have what it takes and they sound just the way I expected them to sound , perfect!2. What? Jekyll's Plea Why?

Because you can never ask Coleen and David to do better in there lusty performances , I love there voices.5. What? Alive (Reprise) Why? David is perfect as Eddie as he sings and vicously stabs the Bishop to death with his cane.6. What? Sympathy, Tenderness (Reprise) Why? Edward sings sofly as Lucy breathes her final breath, he always rock's at any song!7. What? Confrontation Why? David did not loose his breath during this song at all, infact he didn't take one breath he kept going.8. What? Good N' Evil Why? Lucy is beautiful , sexy and sweet as she tells Henry about Good And Evil.I love this musical, when I am always feeling bad I can always play this movie and my frown soon turns into a grin sometimes into tears of sadness and joy. Why, joy? Because as I see the cast bow and walk off stage it just is upsetting that the fun is over and the music that was there has faded into the darkness.

First, I wished they would slow down the tempo a bit, or at least run an announcement that the production was being compressed for time.  I know the attention span of the modern audience grows less each year but the increased tempo bothered me on most of the songs and took away my enjoyment from my favorite piece in the show, the quartet ""Your Work--And Nothing More.""  Second, whatever his vocal limitations, I was impressed to see how David Hasselhoff affected the transformation back and forth between Jekyll and Hyde through body posture and the use of his flowing mane of curly hair (and without makeup).  Third, I was liked the singing voices of both good girl Andrea Rivette and bad girl Coleen Sexton, both in their duet ""In His Eyes"" and separately.  Agreed, Sexton is not Linda Eder, but then who is this side of Streisand? (Besides, how many singers have their husband writing songs for their voice in shows on Broadway?).Of course, in my experience of musicals I have never actually seen a Broadway show on Broadway.  When your main diet of such things are touring companies or productions in L.A. or the Twin Cities you become accustomed to hearing voices other than the original (the exception would be seeing Michael Crawford perform ""Phantom of the Opera"" in L.A.).As for Hasselhoff's performance of the show's anthem, ""This is the Moment,"" my complaint remains that the song simply does not fit the story (a truth proven every time someone uses it for their ice skating routine).  After all, nobody who sees this show is going to be unfamiliar with the story: we know what is going to happen when Dr. Jekyll takes his injection.  The result is that ""This is the Moment"" provides the worst sort of unintentional irony.  The ""sweetest moment of them all"" is going to result in the brutal deaths of several people.  The show's creators realize this as well: notice the immediate and total change in the music at this point as Jekyll prepares the fatal injection.  Besides, the limitations of Hasselhoff's singing voice do not bother me as much as the inconsistency I sense between his Jekyll & Hyde voices at time (again, it is his physical performance that is convincing).  On balance his performance was better than I would have expected and he certainly should earn points for the effort since, as the actor points out after the curtain calls, this role was ""no day at the beach"" (and every fan of ""Baywatch"" who checks this out is one small victory in the name of kulture over pop culture).""Jekyll & Hyde: The Musical"" is one I would grade out at 3.5 stars, and so my rating is designed to nudge the overall score in that direction.

Keep in mind that shows uusally close for a reason: casts tend to get worse and worse as a show progresses through its run.This show had a lot of potential it's original cast (starring Robert Cucciolli and Linda Eder) was absolutely fantastic and really brought Frank Wildhorn's excellent score to life.  Although the plot takes many liberties from those described by Robert Louis Stevenson in his classic short story ""The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" the key elements are still there and in a way improve on the original version.David Hasselhoff sings like a goat with an overly intense rapid vibratto and his female co-stars outshine him easily.  Coleen Sexton and Andrea Rivette are very well cast and have nice voices but still cannot live up to the original cast.To be completely honest, I did not even see the oringal cast on stage, I am judging this primarily by clips I have seen of them and the original cast album.I disagree with people who say Wildhorn wrote a weak score, I believe that the music was very well written and there are plenty of ""Jeckies"" who constantly hum the tunes.  I do, however, see many similarities in the score to Wildhorn's short-lived musical ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" songs sound similar and there are similar vamps playing in the background of each song.  However, Wildhorn, for the first time, incorporated several musical motifs that are effective for the first few times you hear them but, to some, are overused.  But the orchestration is excellent and the direction is very effective.  Thus, don't blame Wildhorn.But, let's not only blame the leads, the ensemble was rarely together, it sounded either poorly rehearsed or just poor casting because it seems like the chorus cannot follow the orchestra or follow eachother.I gave this DVD three stars because the show had potential that was demolished by its casting.  Maybe in a few years it will be revived with better direction and better casting, then it will be time to replace this DVD with something more appealing.My advice is this:  If you're a fan of the music, feel free to buy this DVD to get an idea of the show and how it looked.If you really want to appreciate the show however, buy the original cast or even the concept recording to really get an idea of the show before you touch this DVD.",3,"Great music, horrible cast",1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2397,"['Unfortunately', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'chose', 'film', 'closing', 'cast', 'Keep', 'mind', 'uusally', 'close', 'reason', 'casts', 'tend', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'show', 'run.This', 'show', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'original', 'cast', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Cucciolli', 'Linda', 'Eder', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'really', 'brought', 'Frank', 'Wildhorn', 'excellent', 'score', 'life', 'plot', 'many', 'liberties', 'described', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'classic', 'short', 'story', 'Strange', 'Case', 'Doctor', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'key', 'elements', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'way', 'improve', 'original', 'version.David', 'Hasselhoff', 'sings', 'goat', 'overly', 'intense', 'rapid', 'vibratto', 'female', 'co-stars', 'outshine', 'easily', 'Coleen', 'Sexton', 'Andrea', 'Rivette', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'have', 'nice', 'voices', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'cast.To', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'oringal', 'cast', 'stage', 'am', 'judging', 'primarily', 'clips', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'cast', 'album.I', 'disagree', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'Wildhorn', 'wrote', 'weak', 'score', 'believe', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'are', 'plenty', 'Jeckies', 'who', 'constantly', 'hum', 'tunes', 'do', 'however', 'see', 'many', 'similarities', 'score', 'Wildhorn', 'short-lived', 'musical', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', 'songs', 'sound', 'similar', 'are', 'similar', 'vamps', 'playing', 'background', 'song', 'However', 'Wildhorn', 'first', 'time', 'incorporated', 'several', 'musical', 'motifs', 'are', 'effective', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'hear', 'are', 'overused', 'orchestration', 'excellent', 'direction', 'very', 'effective', 'Thus', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Wildhorn.But', 'let', 'not', 'only', 'blame', 'leads', 'ensemble', 'was', 'rarely', 'together', 'sounded', 'poorly', 'rehearsed', 'just', 'poor', 'casting', 'chorus', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'orchestra', 'follow', 'eachother.I', 'gave', 'DVD', 'three', 'stars', 'show', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'demolished', 'casting', 'Maybe', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'revived', 'better', 'direction', 'better', 'casting', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'replace', 'DVD', 'something', 'more', 'appealing.My', 'advice', ""'re"", 'fan', 'music', 'feel', 'free', 'buy', 'DVD', 'get', 'idea', 'show', 'how', 'really', 'want', 'appreciate', 'show', 'however', 'buy', 'original', 'cast', 'even', 'concept', 'recording', 'really', 'get', 'idea', 'show', 'touch', 'DVD']",N/A

669259,A2ZVEGQWG4TFT5,B00005NKSV,Queen of Annwen,"[6, 7]","Let me start off with saying I ADORE Jekyll and Hyde beyond belief. It still continues to hold a tight fist on my heart and I can't think of many more that surpass it.However, those were my thoughts on the original broadway cast...This movie, starring David Hasselhoff and Coline Sexten, was simply dreadful when it came to the leads. the actors who played Utterson, Mr Carew, and Spider, as I believe he was called, were simply wonderful at their parts, however Hasselhoff and his leading ladies left a great deal to be desired.First of all, Hasselhoff can not play an evil character. To say the least, I thought his interpritation of Jekyll was decent enough, but I swear I cringed at every transformation. Yes, the dynamic duo of Jekyll and Hyde is not an easy part to carry but Hasselhoff managed to destroy it with every fiber of his being.The actress who played Lucy was better than her romantic interests of both Jekyll and Hyde, however, it sounded more like she was used to pop singing, which is good, except when she tried to hit that high ""F"" in ""In his Eyes"". I am taking vocal lessons and working on that duet with a friend, and even though I complain about butchering that note myself, I still sound better than she did.The actress (who's name I can't recal) who played Emma, was better than the aformentioned leads, however, her acting was stiff and her portrayal of the character was somewhat different than what I expected after hearing Christiane Noll.As for the songs, well let me put it this way. I was grossly disappointed. Many vocal lines were spoken instead of sung and tempos got wildly out of hand. As I mentioned, Hasselhoff's Jekyll was passable, yet songs like ""Transformation"" and ""Alive!"" Were simply, in plain terms, HORRIBLE! The man cannot act, period.""In His Eyes"" which has always held a special place in my heart was better though, as I mentioned, Lucy's ""F"" needed to sound less like a shreik.""dangerous Game"" was absolutely terrible!!! ALl Jekyll did was grab Lucy from behind and his singing was attrocious. The actors in the back looked as though they were doing something very questionable and unneeded.The quartet was surprisingly very good. I was very pleased with the actor for utterson, and Facade was good as well.However, The ""Confrontation"", the very crowning glory of the final act was BUTCHERED and then fed to the dogs. I'm sorry, but Hasselhoff failed miserably, no question. THe least he could have done was moved off that back wall. He spent the entire song in one place, jerking from one side to the other. As one reviewer also stated, I was VERY embaressed for him.So, do I recommend this movie or not.. Quite frankly, if you're coming to this for the first time. Put the DVD down and get the original cast recording. Once you've drunk in the awesomeness of what a good musical this truly is, then watch it and see what you think.

669260,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B00005NKSV,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[2, 4]","Despite much negative opinion, this performance is in many respects not half-bad.  I must confess that a good deal of negative criticism focussed on David Hasselhoff seems a lot more like grudge fulfillment.  Still, others have turned in better performances.  The question is, performances of what?  Aye, there's the rub.""Jekyll and Hyde"" occupies the musical and dramatic world of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" - without being anywhere as good as either. Dramatically, although the musical follows a fairly single-minded and coherent line, it seems jumpy and fragmented because of the jumpy and fragmented changes of sets. We might go over the plot at this point - except that here we have classic of English literature which ought to be familiar to every person who gets into high school. If you haven't read Stevenson's tale, go read it and don't expect a Cliff's Notes version of it here.Musically, ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is, in a word, boring. The music gropes in vain to achieve melody but in every instance fall short to one degree or another. The notes meander within traditional tonality, but fail to leave a lasting impression. That some of the numbers achieved a fleeting popularity is more a tribute to marketing than to any inherent musicality. No amount of belting or breathless intensity can give these tuneless tunes any more than an underachieved dramatic impact.It's not an uncommon opinion that the problem with this version of the musical is that it stars David Hasselhoff. This is, to a large extent, a bum rap. I will admit that comparing the sound track here with the CD of the original Broadway production (starring Robert Cuccioli), there's no doubt that the original version is more satisfying. That doesn't mean that Hasselhoff doesn't turn in a solid performance - he does - nor that he doesn't have moments of chewing up the scenery. In fact, in many respects, Hasselhoff is the best thing about the whole production.The star invests his r&#65533;le(s) with sincerity and authenticity. I suspect this gets past some viewers who let themselves get distracted by surfboards and talking cars. This part has been better played and will be better played, but Hasselhoff gives the audience their money's worth nonetheless. He clearly delineates Hyde from Jekyll, although his bag of tricks is rather limited - he sometimes manages a really chilling manic look to Hyde, but not as often as he should. Cuccioli's command of his voice serves him sell in this regard, but Hasselhoff's voice shows little difference between his 2 characters. His singing voice, as it happens, isn't bad. It's certainly up to the singing-in-the-shower sort of voice that we often hear in American musicals.Hasselhoff's part dominates the musical, so that all the other characters are relatively minor. They are, however, played professionally in all cases, giving Hasselhoff a firm backing. I don't see, however, any one performer to single out as being anything but good-but-not-great.I have already alluded to the physical presentation of the production. The many sets tend toward darkness rather than brightness. As a continuing factor, this becomes dreary. One wonders why we didn't start with well-lighted sets and gradually move toward darker ones. In addition to the less-than-useful dimness, the frequent set changes make the musical seem fidgety. Fortunately, the musical itself shows a single-minded devotion to its story line and manages - barely - to preserve a sense of unity and linear development.On the whole, ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is entertaining on one hand and a bit of a chore to watch on the other. It tries very hard to ingratiate itself, succeeds in part, but in the end fails owing to the grisly nature of its development and ending. Nonetheless, it's a fine effort and worth seeing.

Unlike many of the critics here, I have more compassion for Mr. Hasselhoff than they do. Clearly, David put both his heart and soul into this performance. I was moved both emotionally and spritually by his performance and appreciate most of all that he didn't let the so-called professional critics hold him back from taking on this immense task. Thankfully, he did take it on, and did a most admirable job of it. Having seen him in many other venues, I believe he has pulled off the performance of a lifetime for himself.

As his first Broadway appearance (and hopefully NOT his last), David Hasselhoff's performance is memorable.  Although his voice seems slightly weak in the beginning, his acting more than compensates for any perceived vocal deficiency.  This is not a production for the faint-hearted.  Mr. Hasselhoff's Edward Hyde is, indeed, a sadistic creature who commits violent murders.  The duet between Jekyll and Hyde is a daring idea, and Mr. Hasselhoff's rendition is brilliant and flawless -- a unique moment in theatre history not likely to be repeated or surpassed!  The supporting cast is quite good, especially the four co-stars.  The DVD bonus prelude provides an opportunity for Mr. Hasselhoff to share interesting behind-the scenes commentary about his role.  This Jekyll and Hyde is a welcome addition to anyone's video collection.

This was my 7th time seeing this show on stage. I saw it twice on it's Pre-Broadway tour (with Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder) and 5 times more in the past few years.  This was by far the best (full) production of the show.  Although, no one can touch Linda Eder.Although, I'm giving this DVD a bad rating, JEKYLL & HYDE IS MY FAVORITE SHOW.  What I can't understand is, why didn't they film an on-stage version of the show, especially with the current touring company.  This current tour has been expanded to include all the recordings missing from the Cast CD from the Broadway show.  Get the double CD studio recording (CD) for the full version.A friend of mine who saw the Pre-Broadway show with me, visited New York and saw it on Broadway. He told me, ""Don't see the show in New York, you will hate it"" They've added new songs and deleted great songs from the show. An example, why did they replace Bring on the Men with Good and Evil? Big mistake. Also, if you pay attention to the Cast (Broadway) CD, you will notice that the show seems rushed. GET THE DOUBLE CD set for the best version of the show (musically and vocally).If they were going for a name in this DVD Production (David Hasselhof), it was unnecessary - just read the rest of the reviews here on Amazon - not good.  The current touring cast is excellent and would have done justice to this great show.I guess you should just view the DVD and judge for yourself.

David Hasselhoff has an incredible singing voice and to give the performance he does in Jekyll and Hyde - The Musical is very impressive. But I admit I was a bit frustrated when I saw him practically pass out during his major schizo song. When that bed came in and he was still walking offstage, you could tell that song took quite a bit out of him.Colleen Sexton as Lucy Harris. Wow wow wow wow wow! She brought quite a bit to the table, and she was in incredible company with the distinguished performers she shared the stage with including Andrea Rivette as Emma Carew. Sexton's and Rivette's performance of In His Eyes was outstanding. Not better than the original performances that predecessed Hasselhoff, but definitely is a ranking force in it's own.

However, the joy quickly turned to disappointment with the cast that was used for the video/telecast. Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder were - in a word - superb. Ms Eder has the voice and presence the video lacks. Cuccioli is a splendid actor whose transformation of Jekyll to Hyde was thrilling and far beyond the ability of Mr. Baywatch. Cuccioli, with use of body language and voice, makes two different characters believeable. His dialog between Jekyll and Hyde near the end was remarkable.
