1262428,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002C7ELY0,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","TENNESSEE is a minimalist film: there is very little dialogue, not a lot of movement, not a huge climax.  It just happens and while it is happening it changes you.  Though it is a small budget film it makes a big impact, making us wish that there were more films like this to counterbalance all the big over the top bonanzas that seem to rule the theater circuit.  It is gently written (by Russell Schaumburg), sensitive directed by Aaron Woodley, and acted with honesty by a fine young cast.Ellis (Ethan Peck, definitely an actor on the rise) and Carter (Adam Rothenberg (ditto) are brothers; their mother is dead and their father has a history of abusing the boys to the point that Ellis and Carter no longer see him.  Ellis is a photographer by hobby, taking photographs of mountains and landscapes in their Tennessee small town: Carter drinks too much but looks after his younger brother.  Ellis is diagnosed as having leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant - Carter offers  but despite being siblings the match is not adequate.  The brothers set out on a trip to be together and end up in New Mexico. But soon they are on the road again and in Texas they pause at a diner where they meet Krystal (Mariah Carey) waiting tables, but preferring to write songs.  Seeing that the brothers have no money, Krystal takes them home - she is married to an alcoholic Texas Ranger Frank (Lance Reddick) who routinely beats her and demands that the 'freeloaders' be gone in the morning. The next morning the three of them take the car and head to Tennessee - the boys have decided that Ellis' only hope is to find their father to see if he is a candidate to donate bone marrow. The three are chased by Frank until they finally reach Tennessee where, for need of cash, Krystal sings in a nightclub contest and captures the audience's approval while she now has money to give to the brothers to find their father.How these disparate, desperate people come together emotionally and the manner in which the story ends may seem too pat for some, but for viewers with vulnerable hearts this little film will be fulfilling. Each of the cast is excellent, but it is such a pleasure to see Mariah Carey in a role that merits her talent and find that she handles it so well  is rewarding.  It is a small story with a huge heart.

1262429,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B002C7ELY0,G. Teslovich,"[2, 10]","Plot consists of an unrealistic string of failures and poverty. Such as, in order: Abusive husband to his wife and his son with stereotypic fight of son to save mother. Son and mother flee. Mother dies. Son is abusive, at times, to his brother who has cancer. Brother loses contact with his girlfriend. Both brothers go searching for missing dad in car that breaks down. They meet Mariah the waitress (of course) who is abused by her boss and her husband. Abused Mariah teams up with abused brothers and they end up being chased by Mariah's abusive husband who happens to be a cop. Abusive cop while in pursuit encounters abusive couple in bathroom scene. Father is found dead. Brother also dies. Ashes, of course, are spread on mountain.Very poorly produced, edited, acted and written. Put together at the last moment with limited funds and last minute signee actors. So cheap the hospital scene looks like a motel room with a rented oxygen bottle for ambience. Movie has a staged, rehearsed feel to it such as the obligatory depression era jumping boxcars to get to Tennessee and the stilted and excruciating long scenes of poorly lit rooms, car journeys and scenic hills.Mariah's role in movie is physical appeal, 3 minutes of singing and her vast movie acting education telling the directors how she should act.Movie was suppose to be heartbreakin' honest in order to make the audience weep and see life as beautiful. Instead it was heartbreakin' contrived in all respects.",1,Abusive,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,1477,"['Plot', 'unrealistic', 'string', 'failures', 'poverty', 'Such', 'order', 'Abusive', 'husband', 'wife', 'son', 'stereotypic', 'fight', 'son', 'save', 'mother', 'Son', 'mother', 'flee', 'dies', 'Son', 'abusive', 'times', 'brother', 'who', 'cancer', 'contact', 'girlfriend', 'brothers', 'go', 'searching', 'missing', 'dad', 'car', 'down', 'meet', 'Mariah', 'waitress', 'course', 'who', 'abused', 'boss', 'husband', 'Abused', 'Mariah', 'teams', 'up', 'abused', 'brothers', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'chased', 'Mariah', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'cop', 'Abusive', 'cop', 'pursuit', 'encounters', 'abusive', 'couple', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'Father', 'found', 'dead', 'Brother', 'also', 'Ashes', 'course', 'are', 'spread', 'mountain.Very', 'poorly', 'produced', 'edited', 'acted', 'written', 'Put', 'together', 'last', 'moment', 'limited', 'funds', 'last', 'minute', 'signee', 'actors', 'So', 'cheap', 'hospital', 'scene', 'motel', 'room', 'rented', 'oxygen', 'bottle', 'ambience', 'Movie', 'staged', 'rehearsed', 'feel', 'such', 'obligatory', 'depression', 'era', 'jumping', 'boxcars', 'get', 'Tennessee', 'stilted', 'excruciating', 'long', 'scenes', 'poorly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'car', 'journeys', 'scenic', 'hills.Mariah', 'role', 'movie', 'physical', 'appeal', '3', 'minutes', 'singing', 'vast', 'movie', 'acting', 'education', 'telling', 'directors', 'how', 'should', 'act.Movie', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'heartbreakin', 'honest', 'order', 'make', 'audience', 'weep', 'see', 'life', 'beautiful', 'Instead', 'was', 'heartbreakin', 'contrived', 'respects']",Tennessee
