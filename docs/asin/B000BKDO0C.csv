I'm not a geologist, but these theories certainly tend to disprove certain prior idea(s) that the earth is only about 6,000 years old.This is an EXCELLENT production that all but the least scientific among us will probably appreciate, if only on an 'armchair' basis.So much for religion...",5,an excellent theory...,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,598,"[""'too"", 'bad', 'may', 'never', 'have', ""'definitive"", 'proof', 'theory', 'series', 'megafloods', 'combined', 'with-demonstrated', 'layers', 'extracta', 'Mt', 'St', 'Helens', 'support', 'theory', 'now.Wisdom', 'shown', 'old', 'theories', 'die', 'new', 'ones', 'not', 'necessarily', 'accurate', 'ones', 'take', 'place', ""'m"", 'not', 'geologist', 'theories', 'certainly', 'tend', 'disprove', 'certain', 'prior', 'idea', 'earth', 'only', 'about', '6,000', 'years', 'old.This', 'EXCELLENT', 'production', 'least', 'scientific', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'only', ""'armchair"", 'basis.So', 'much', 'religion']",NOVA: Mystery of the Megaflood

943708,A3CTNILCZ3U2LG,B000BKDO0C,"Barry Hampe ""Author: 'Making Documentary Film...","[9, 9]","NOVA at its very best deals with a scientific investigation by telling fascinating stories with pictures. This film is a superb example. We learn that during the last ice age, an ice dam half a mile high blocked a valley in Montana, creating an enormous lake behind it. Then, for reasons explained in the film, the dam suddenly collapsed, releasing a towering wall of water that pushed along everything in its way. The theory is nicely explained with a combination of footage from actual geological sites and animation that shows how these sites probably came to be. And then we learn this happened not once, but many times, as Earth went through extreme periods of warming and cooling long before humans arrived on the scene.Any would-be documentarian should study this film (and others like it) to learn how to get beyond tedious interviews and uninspiring B-roll footage to a truly exciting way to present nonfiction on video.",5,Truly Exciting Nonfiction,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,929,"['NOVA', 'very', 'best', 'deals', 'scientific', 'investigation', 'telling', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'pictures', 'film', 'superb', 'example', 'learn', 'last', 'ice', 'age', 'ice', 'dam', 'mile', 'high', 'blocked', 'valley', 'Montana', 'creating', 'enormous', 'lake', 'Then', 'reasons', 'explained', 'film', 'dam', 'suddenly', 'collapsed', 'releasing', 'towering', 'wall', 'water', 'pushed', 'along', 'everything', 'way', 'theory', 'nicely', 'explained', 'combination', 'footage', 'actual', 'geological', 'sites', 'animation', 'how', 'probably', 'came', 'be', 'then', 'learn', 'happened', 'not', 'once', 'many', 'times', 'Earth', 'went', 'extreme', 'periods', 'warming', 'cooling', 'long', 'before', 'humans', 'arrived', 'scene.Any', 'would-be', 'documentarian', 'should', 'study', 'film', 'others', 'learn', 'how', 'get', 'tedious', 'interviews', 'uninspiring', 'B-roll', 'footage', 'truly', 'exciting', 'way', 'present', 'nonfiction', 'video']",NOVA: Mystery of the Megaflood

This DVD presentation by NOVA offers an excellent explanation for the odd ripples, misplaced boulders, dry waterfalls and deep sediment found in the area.For many years geologist assumed the landscape was created over the eons by repeating floods, wind, erosion, etc... However, a new theory by Harlen Bretz in the 1920s insisted that a massive cataclysmic flood must have occurred in order to create the landscape features found.The DVD shows CGI presentations that recreate a massive flood formed by a failed ice dam over Montana, and how a massive wall of water swept through the valley suddenly.  The film has many landscape shots of the area and shows how evidence of a massive flood (or possibly several floods) is still evident.

The Scab Lands (that is, the aftereffects) of this flood are on par with the Grand Canyon.The only drawback is the presentation. For me, the music was too loud and more in keeping with heavy metal; the flood animation was used too many times (as if we had ADD).

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[0, 0]","'Mystery of the Megaflood' features a geologist and his bold theory that explained strange land formations in eastern Washington State. His peers had believed that, like the Grand Canyon etc., these features had been carved out over eons; J. Harlen Bretz, however, became convinced that instead they were the result of an enormous flood. The 'hole' in his theory was an inability to explain how this happened.Then came Joseph Pardee, who became convinced the answer came from the breaching of an enormous lake created by a glacial dam. Then, just recently, another scientist in Iceland explained how such a dam could suddenly collapse.",4,Interesting -,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,635,"[""'Mystery"", 'Megaflood', 'features', 'geologist', 'bold', 'theory', 'explained', 'strange', 'land', 'formations', 'eastern', 'Washington', 'State', 'peers', 'had', 'believed', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'etc.', 'features', 'had', 'been', 'carved', 'out', 'eons', 'J.', 'Harlen', 'Bretz', 'however', 'became', 'convinced', 'instead', 'were', 'result', 'enormous', 'flood', ""'hole"", 'theory', 'was', 'inability', 'explain', 'how', 'happened.Then', 'came', 'Joseph', 'Pardee', 'who', 'became', 'convinced', 'answer', 'came', 'breaching', 'enormous', 'lake', 'created', 'glacial', 'dam', 'Then', 'just', 'recently', 'scientist', 'Iceland', 'explained', 'how', 'such', 'dam', 'could', 'suddenly', 'collapse']",NOVA: Mystery of the Megaflood

This DVD doesn't disappoint. There is a huge canyon that starts in Montana, goes through Idaho and ends up going through the Pacific ocean end of Washington State.The author, a respected Geologist, knew that this wierd place was not ordinary.  His research on this mystery lasted many years. Many geologists disagreed with his theories. Finally the proof was irrefutable. Alt was hailed. Many geologists studied this incredible formation. It turned out that floods went through these lands thousands of times during the ice ages. The formations are unique to our planet.The DVD is well made and the explainations are great.
