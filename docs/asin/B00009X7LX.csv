I bought this for my sister's birthday, and it does not disappoint. ESPN Asia decided to ditch NHL for EPL (football/soccer) matches and we've been deprived of hockey for about 2 years, so we missed the 2002 - 2003 season completely.I've not fully explored the whole DVD but have watched about 70% of it. There's quite a lot of content in it. If you're a Devil's fan, you must get this. I'm not but loved it all the same. Some highlights were the full 3rd period of Devils vs. Senators, walking around with Brodeur after the final game (that was funny and cute) and the interview with the players (interspersed with highlights of each match, in the run up to the finals). Out of the other 2 DVDs I ordered at the same time (NHL All-Access, NHL: Lord Stanley's Cup) this was the most enjoyable to watch, and had the most content.Although I would definitely prefer watching each individual game live, I'll have to settle for this. I'll be getting the 2003 - 2004 season, whenever it comes out.",5,Great all-round coverage,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1132,"['someone', 'who', 'living', 'tropical', 'climate', 'zillion', 'miles', 'so', 'anywhere', 'NHL', 'game', 'played', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'bought', 'sister', 'birthday', 'not', 'disappoint', 'ESPN', 'Asia', 'decided', 'ditch', 'NHL', 'EPL', 'football/soccer', 'matches', ""'ve"", 'been', 'deprived', 'hockey', '2', 'years', 'missed', '2002', '2003', 'season', 'completely.I', ""'ve"", 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'whole', 'DVD', 'have', 'watched', '70', '%', 'quite', 'lot', 'content', ""'re"", 'Devil', 'fan', 'must', 'get', ""'m"", 'not', 'loved', 'same', 'highlights', 'were', 'full', '3rd', 'period', 'Devils', 'vs', 'Senators', 'walking', 'around', 'Brodeur', 'final', 'game', 'was', 'funny', 'cute', 'interview', 'players', 'interspersed', 'highlights', 'match', 'run', 'up', 'finals', 'other', '2', 'DVDs', 'ordered', 'same', 'time', 'NHL', 'All-Access', 'NHL', 'Lord', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'had', 'most', 'content.Although', 'would', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'watching', 'individual', 'game', 'live', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', ""'ll"", 'be', 'getting', '2003', '2004', 'season', 'whenever', 'out']",N/A

Basically Whoopie Goldberg takes you on a nice tour of the entire trip to the Stanley Cup Championships, starting with their loss in 2002 and ending with the game 7 win in 2003.  The DVD doesn't really have a whole ton of extra features, but it does have enough to keep any die-hard fan happy enough until next time the boys raise the cup in glory.",4,Nice way to remember,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,522,"['Being', 'pretty', 'big', 'Devils', 'fan', 'was', 'going', 'buy', 'even', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'bubble', 'gum', 'added', 'bonus', 'was', 'fact', 'footage', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Basically', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg', 'nice', 'tour', 'entire', 'trip', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'Championships', 'starting', 'loss', '2002', 'ending', 'game', '7', 'win', '2003', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'whole', 'ton', 'extra', 'features', 'have', 'enough', 'keep', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'happy', 'enough', 'next', 'time', 'boys', 'raise', 'cup', 'glory']",N/A
