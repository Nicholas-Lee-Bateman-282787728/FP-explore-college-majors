1270256,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002IFUCZ8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 8]","As WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) tries to find it's latest star and face that can propel the company on the big screen, the company has had success with stars such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, John Cena and Stone Cold Steve Austin but also a few that hardly registered on the radar.The latest wrestler to go on the big screen is one of their newer wrestler's Ted DiBiase, Jr., son of Ted DiBiase (The Million Dollar Man).  With the film originally planned for WWE wrestler Randy Orton, due to a collarbone injury, DiBiase Jr. took on the role for  ""The Marine 2"" and is his first major theatrical debut.""The Marine 2"" is directed by Roel Reine (""The Lost Tribe"", ""Adrenaline"") and features a screenplay by Christopher Borrelli (""Whisper"") and John Chapin Morgan.  Cinematography is by Joost Van Starrenburg (""Holy Water"", ""Bodega"", ""George and the Dragon"") and music composed by Trevor Morris (""Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2"", ""The Tudors"", ""Kings"").The film receives a direct-to-video release (Blu-ray and DVD) and hoping to achieve the same results as the first film which made over $30 million in home sales and rental.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Marine 2"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and in widescreen (1:85:1) with AVC@33MBPS.  Let me just say that I was amazed about the cinematography of this film.  I really thought this would be a low budget affair and what we see in the film are beautiful overhead shots of the island and also some underwater cinematography as well.There is nice detail from the beginning with Joe and his partner on the rooftop of the buildings and you can see the detail in the concrete and sweat dripping through his skin.  Skin tones are natural, pores can be seen and the film is absolutely vibrant with the shots of the island resort looking quite beautiful and also showcasing the Southeast Asian villages and the detail of the older homes seaside.  Overall, I was impressed by the cinematography by Joost Van Starrenburg and also director Roel Reine who did a lot of the film's camera work and ""The Marine 2' actually looks very good on Blu-ray.As for the audio, lossless audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Also, in Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.""The Marine 2' is an action-driven film.  Plenty of explosions, broken glass, crashing wood, vehicles, concrete breaking apart, you name it...this film has plenty of action and you hear it.Dialogue is clean and understandable through the front and center channels,  front and surround channels showcase a lot of the special effects and LFE fans who love that bass, are going to love hearing their subwoofer put to work.Overall, I was quite impressed with the picture and audio quality of this Blu-ray release.  I thought it was going to be a low-budget affair but very good cinematography and good use of audio through the action segments.As for the subtitles, subtitles are presented in Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Marine 2' comes with the following special features:* Village Virtuoso: The Final Fight - (5:15) Interviews with the cast and crew in regards to the village of where the final scenes were shot and shooting in Bang Pat, Thailand.* The Last Resort: Inside the Terrorists' Siege - (3:03) Director Roel Reine talks about the planning the shots of the resort by using a miniature and storyboards.* East Meets West: Muay Thai Fight - (4:44) The preparation that went on in making and filming the Muay Thai fight scene with interviews with the cast, crew and Seng, the fighting choreographer.* Building a Legacy: Ted's Story - (5:04) The story about Ted DiBiase Jr. and being a third generation wrestler in the WWE and now shooting his first film.

I have to admit that I literally came in with low expectations with this film because a)  Ted DiBiase Jr. is one of the newer and younger WWE Superstars who has played a villain since emerging in WWE  b) It's a WWE sequel to a film that starred John Cena and is direct-to-video and c) ""The Marine"" was not exactly a great film (although it did well in DVD sales and rental).So, I came into this film not expecting much and after watching this Blu-ray release... Wow!  It was pretty good.  And I'll say it right now, it was much better than some of the WWE films that came out in theaters.  Really good cinematography (picture quality was solid on Blu-ray), good use of lossless audio showcasing the action throughout your home theater surround channels and nice LFE coming from the subwoofer(s).  And in addition to the Blu-ray's PQ and AQ, the release features a good number of special features.I actually was impressed with DiBiase Jr.'s performance.  It helps that he's a newer wrestler because he has not suffered career threatening injuries just yet, he's very mobile, quick on his feet and not as rigid when it comes to the fight scenes.  I know this film was originally planned for Randy Orton before his injury but for his first acting role, DiBiase, Jr. did a wonderful job.Overall, for a WWE film, I must admit that the film is one of the better WWE films that I've seen.  I was expecting for a low budget crapfest but ""The Marine 2"" was a pretty damn good action film and the Blu-ray release is pretty solid!If you are a WWE or DiBiase fan or looking for a straight-up action popcorn flick, ""The Marine 2"" is worth checking out!",4,"Blu-ray: I was expecting an absoute crapfest but sure enough ""The Marine 2"" is among the better WWE-related films out

1270257,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B002IFUCZ8,D.P.,"[8, 9]","This is the sixth movie to come from WWE Studios however what makes this one ""special"" this is the first sequel they've done...however, this is the third time they've done a movie with a very similar story.  Now just like how ""The Marine"" was the movie debut for John Cena, this sequel is the acting debut for Ted Dibiase (Jr.).Now this movie is one of those type of sequels where it has absolutely no connection to the previous movie with the exception of it being a very similar plot so don't expect to see any reference or characters you saw in the first Marine movie (sorry John Cena fans).  The story here is about a man named Joe Linwood (Dibiase) who's a Marine & after coming off a mission, he decided to go on vacation with his wife Robin to an exotic island resort that's owned by a client of hers. Everything starts out nice before terrorist attack at the grand opening party & takes everyone hostage including Joe's wife.  From there, Joe is determined to go in & get her but has to deal with the terrorist themselves along with other obstacles like politicians trying to not make this an international incident, a retired Army soldier who doesn't ""want to be a hero"", mercenaries who work for the highest price, and finding out throughout the movie that not everyone can be trusted.As usual when it comes to sequels, they all get compared to the original.  What this & the first Marine have in common is the story of a Marine being in the wrong place at the wrong time with his wife being taken hostage & with him going to save her.  Besides that basis along with the involvement of certain elements that go into an action movie, that's really the only thing this movie has in common with it as Dibiase does more ""acting"" as far as dialog than Cena did while his character was more ""realistic"". There was more dept & development as far as the story itself goes along with them learning from the first film & not trying to mix bad humor in with the movie.  One of the big differences here was unlike how ""The Marine"" had a heavy amount of their action based off explosions, the action here was more diverse as you had a minor amount of explosions with more emphasis on gunplay & fighting using the Muay Thai style.DVD extras include deleted & extended scenes along with a montage of various deleted shots.  Various ""behind the scenes"" features, a look at Ted Dibiase, and various takes of the Muay Thai fights complete the extras...and as a side note, I'm sorry but there are no commentary tracks.  In the end, I would say that this movie was more ""plot"" driven than action driven unlike how the first Marine & other WWE films have been.  I enjoyed other WWE films more than this one but it's still worth taking a look at so I suggest a rental & you decide from there.",3,"Different People, Different Setting, Same Story",1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2780,"['sixth', 'movie', 'come', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'however', 'what', 'one', 'special', 'first', 'sequel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'however', 'third', 'time', ""'ve"", 'done', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'Now', 'just', 'how', 'Marine', 'was', 'movie', 'debut', 'John', 'Cena', 'sequel', 'acting', 'debut', 'Ted', 'Dibiase', 'Jr.', '.Now', 'movie', 'one', 'type', 'sequels', 'where', 'absolutely', 'connection', 'previous', 'movie', 'exception', 'being', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'reference', 'characters', 'saw', 'first', 'Marine', 'movie', 'sorry', 'John', 'Cena', 'fans', 'story', 'here', 'man', 'named', 'Joe', 'Linwood', 'Dibiase', 'who', 'Marine', 'coming', 'off', 'mission', 'decided', 'go', 'vacation', 'wife', 'Robin', 'exotic', 'island', 'resort', 'owned', 'client', 'hers', 'Everything', 'out', 'nice', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'grand', 'opening', 'party', 'everyone', 'hostage', 'including', 'Joe', 'wife', 'there', 'Joe', 'determined', 'go', 'get', 'deal', 'terrorist', 'other', 'obstacles', 'politicians', 'trying', 'not', 'make', 'international', 'incident', 'retired', 'Army', 'soldier', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hero', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'work', 'highest', 'price', 'finding', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'trusted.As', 'usual', 'when', 'sequels', 'get', 'compared', 'original', 'What', 'first', 'Marine', 'have', 'common', 'story', 'Marine', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'wife', 'being', 'taken', 'hostage', 'going', 'save', 'basis', 'involvement', 'certain', 'elements', 'go', 'action', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'common', 'Dibiase', 'more', 'acting', 'as', 'far', 'dialog', 'Cena', 'did', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'was', 'more', 'dept', 'development', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'along', 'learning', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'mix', 'bad', 'humor', 'movie', 'One', 'big', 'differences', 'here', 'was', 'how', 'Marine', 'had', 'heavy', 'amount', 'action', 'based', 'off', 'explosions', 'action', 'here', 'was', 'more', 'diverse', 'had', 'minor', 'amount', 'explosions', 'more', 'emphasis', 'gunplay', 'fighting', 'using', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'style.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'montage', 'various', 'deleted', 'shots', 'Various', 'scenes', 'features', 'look', 'Ted', 'Dibiase', 'various', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'fights', 'complete', 'extras', 'side', 'note', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'plot', 'driven', 'action', 'driven', 'how', 'first', 'Marine', 'other', 'WWE', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'WWE', 'films', 'more', 'one', 'still', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', 'so', 'suggest', 'rental', 'decide', 'there']",N/A

For example, He plays the role very honestly, sort of how Bruce Willis Played John Mcclain in the Die Hard movies. You Think Ted's character doesn't stand a chance but somehow he makes things happen. Also another surprise was his acting. There's a moment where you forget he's a wrestler. It's really nice to see someone actually have real chemistry with their co-stars. The  action is top notch, although i would of preferred not seeing wrestling moves, witch aren't many, maybe like three moves but still. I know the WWE is behind these films but i don't understand why they always have to incorporate wrestling into all their films. Anyways, overall, this movie is worth watching. People need to stop being so close minded and give this movie a chance. And the WWE needs t ostart paying attention to Ted DiBiase because he has the potential to be a huge success in his own right, weather it be in the wrestling ring or in films.

1270274,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B002IFUCZ8,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","When people hear WWE films, or see that a wrestler is starring in a movie, they are automatically turned off, and I never understood why. We tend to see wrestlers as muscles heads, running around in their underwear, but the truth is that wrestling is fake. These guys are all actors who every week need to learn line and choreography, just like an actor does! When WWE films was launched in 2006, a lot of people snickered, but the truth is, we've gotten some pretty films from the company, including 12 Rounds, The Call, See No Evil, and The Marine. Much like other Action films, the plot of the Marine 2 is somewhat thin. The story features a highly decorated, U.S. Marine, on vacation with his wife, when the resort is overrun by terrorists. The Marine (Ted DiBiase Jr.), has to take it upon himself to save his wife and the other hostages, when it becomes painfully obvious that the local military isn't equipped to deal with the terrorists. DiBiase Jr., a third generation wrestler, is the star of this film, an unlike John Cena in the first film, DiBiase really seems to have some type of military training in his background. The action and fight sequences are much better in this film then they were in the first. DiBiase Jr. really seems to know what he's doing and it made the story that much more enjoyable. What DiBiase Jr. lacks in acting skills, is more than made up for with the terrific action sequences. He is also aided by some fairly big names for a film like this, including Michael Rooker of The Walking Dead and Star Wars, Temuera Morrison. The first Marine film was a debut for a studio and lacked the bite of most Action films. The second installment was much better, featuring a more experienced cast, and much better fight sequences. You may not want to see this film, because it's a WWE production, and I can respect that, but in all honesty, you'll be missing out on a more than decent Action movie.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1926,"['When', 'people', 'hear', 'WWE', 'films', 'see', 'wrestler', 'starring', 'movie', 'are', 'automatically', 'turned', 'off', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'tend', 'see', 'wrestlers', 'muscles', 'heads', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'truth', 'wrestling', 'fake', 'guys', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'week', 'need', 'learn', 'line', 'choreography', 'just', 'actor', 'When', 'WWE', 'films', 'was', 'launched', '2006', 'lot', 'people', 'snickered', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'pretty', 'films', 'company', 'including', '12', 'Rounds', 'Call', 'See', 'No', 'Evil', 'Marine', 'Much', 'other', 'Action', 'films', 'plot', 'Marine', '2', 'somewhat', 'thin', 'story', 'highly', 'decorated', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'vacation', 'wife', 'when', 'resort', 'overrun', 'terrorists', 'Marine', 'Ted', 'DiBiase', 'Jr.', 'take', 'save', 'wife', 'other', 'hostages', 'when', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'local', 'military', ""n't"", 'equipped', 'deal', 'terrorists', 'DiBiase', 'Jr.', 'third', 'generation', 'wrestler', 'star', 'film', 'John', 'Cena', 'first', 'film', 'DiBiase', 'really', 'have', 'type', 'military', 'training', 'background', 'action', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'then', 'were', 'first', 'DiBiase', 'Jr.', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'made', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'What', 'DiBiase', 'Jr.', 'acting', 'skills', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'also', 'aided', 'fairly', 'big', 'names', 'film', 'including', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'first', 'Marine', 'film', 'was', 'debut', 'studio', 'lacked', 'bite', 'most', 'Action', 'films', 'second', 'installment', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'featuring', 'more', 'experienced', 'cast', 'much', 'better', 'fight', 'sequences', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'WWE', 'production', 'can', 'respect', 'honesty', ""'ll"", 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'more', 'decent', 'Action', 'movie']",N/A
