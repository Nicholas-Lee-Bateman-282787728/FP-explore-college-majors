Hauser""","[3, 4]","""The Descendents of Jesus traced through the Odonic and Davidic Dynasties"" is the second title of this DVD, which sums it up nicely.If you've seen The DaVinci Code or read the book, or any of the literature that book was based on, you're familiar with this material.  The theory is that Jesus was married (in this DVD, to Mary Magdalene) and his descendents live even today.  This DVD is basically an extended interview with Professor Hugh Montgomery, whose research into the genealogy of Jesus is deep and extensive, and he explains it well.  As the Tom Hanks of this version, he's believable and compelling, spinning a fascinating mystery.  He connects Jesus to the Vikings, and the most powerful royal families in European history, including within the Vatican itself.  And George Washington was related to Jesus!  Of course, the Montgomery family itself (so says the professor) is also related to Jesus.  Unfortunately, some of the evidence for this is in documents by the families themselves, which only proves those powerful people had a lot of gall, but doesn't actually prove the fact.

What this documentary poses does not dispute any of the belief systems but the fact that it isn't quite what you thought it was. BRAIN WASHING as he states toward the end of the document is exactly what has happened. I won't dispute certain faith based belief's but I will say the story isn't quite what everyone thinks it is. History is written by the winners. Think about it long and hard. The bible is a book written by a winner.As far as the truth..this may or may not be uncovered. My guess is that those on the fringes, like this documentary, will be kept in the closet because uncovering the truth would mean a large portion of the world would have to think for themselves and find the truth.

God Kings: The Descendants Of Jesus was really interesting, whether you're a fan of genealogy, history, or Jesus.  Hugh Montgomery, a retired professor, talks about his work with tracing the lineage of Jesus back through the Norman Conquest.  Like myself, Professor Montgomery enjoys genealogy and became interested in tracing Jesus's descendants when he was exploring his own family tree.  In this film the theory is that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and their descendants live to this day. The whole lineage is explained clearly and, true or not, is interesting nonetheless.  In fact, Professor Montgomery believes that his family is also a distant relative of Jesus!
