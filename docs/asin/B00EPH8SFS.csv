1668475,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B00EPH8SFS,Addicted2Amazon!,"[11, 13]","As undoubtedly explained, Tracy Anderson's new ""Cardio + Dance"" is composed of two seperate 30 minute ""dance-y"" workouts.  The biggest difference between this workout and her previous ones is a lack of choreography.  In previous workouts, you had to learn several combinations BEFORE working out, and the workout was comprised of just doing the combinations repeatedly for the length of an entire song.  The downside of that was having to take extra time to learn the combos.  The upside was that you were actually dancing some moderately challenging choreography, which felt great, and you got a pretty intense cardio workout.  This new workout is a complete change, a ""follow-the-leader"", style which I've never seen before.  There is no learning, no choreography...You literally just do what she is doing while she's doing it and try to keep up.The good about this style is that you are working out, sweating, burning calories, right away. Just pop in the DVD and go. No extra time needed to learn anything.  The bad, and this will be a big gripe for many people, is that you have no idea what she is about to do until she does it or until it's already over. There also is absolutely no verbal instruction.  She never speaks once.  You get no verbal cueing about what comes next, but also, no annoying ""Yeah! You can do it!"" banter. Fortunately, the moves are not that fast and are very Beginner Level and generally repetitive.  We get A LOT of grapevines, step touches to the front, front and back taps with one foot and side to side hip shakes.  Though the counts vary (for example, on one set she'll do 4 hip shakes before switching to the next move, and on another set she'll do 8 before switching), with repetition you'll figure it out.  Your body and mind will probably eventually start to memorize movements.Though this workout does have you covering some floor space and moving NON-STOP for 30 minutes, it's not nearly as intense as her previous ones, mainly because this one is a little slower paced and a lot lower impact. It has almost no hopping, and your feet don't really leave the floor for about 95% of the workout. However, there are some jumping jacks and a tiny bit of skipping thrown in here and there, but this is nothing compared to all the hopping and jumping done in her other dance DVDs.  So whereas in her previous ones I actually had to stop at certain points to catch my breath or relieve my tired legs, this one I was able to easily get through without stopping.  In fact, I had to really throw myself into the moves in order to max out the cardio benefit.  By the end, however, I was pretty sweaty and felt like I had a good workout.  It may not be my favorite workout ever in the world, but I enjoy it as a fun and different cardio workout that will last me for a few months, until I tire of it and move on to something else.  :-)However, in order to really want to do this, you have to WANT to move.  And the music on this does nothing for me.  I enjoyed the warmup music, but once the beat kicks in for the main event, I just found it...blah.  Completely uninspiring.  My solution was to mute it and dance to my own music, which does wonders.  Of course, I had to find music that more or less fits the tempo of her music here, and I found that a lot of EDM and pop dance remixes fit well.  Some of the songs that I like to use with this right now include ""Sexy Chick"" by David Guetta, ""Blow(Cirkut Remix)"" by Ke$ha, ""Levels"" by Avicii and one of the remixes to ""Lights"" by Ellie Goulding, I forget which one...Some songs are close but not a perfect fit, but I just do the moves to the beat.  If its a little faster than TA, even better!  It's fun and I'm motivated to just move for half an hour.",4,"Effective, Different, and Fun (ONCE I CHANGED THE MUSIC!!)",1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,3731,"['undoubtedly', 'explained', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'new', 'Cardio', '+', 'Dance', 'composed', 'two', 'seperate', '30', 'minute', 'dance-y', 'workouts', 'biggest', 'difference', 'workout', 'previous', 'ones', 'lack', 'choreography', 'previous', 'workouts', 'had', 'learn', 'several', 'combinations', 'working', 'out', 'workout', 'was', 'comprised', 'just', 'doing', 'combinations', 'repeatedly', 'length', 'entire', 'song', 'downside', 'was', 'having', 'take', 'extra', 'time', 'learn', 'combos', 'upside', 'was', 'were', 'actually', 'dancing', 'moderately', 'challenging', 'choreography', 'felt', 'great', 'got', 'pretty', 'intense', 'cardio', 'workout', 'new', 'workout', 'complete', 'change', 'follow-the-leader', 'style', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'learning', 'choreography', 'literally', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'doing', 'doing', 'try', 'keep', 'up.The', 'good', 'style', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'sweating', 'burning', 'calories', 'right', 'away', 'Just', 'pop', 'DVD', 'go', 'extra', 'time', 'needed', 'learn', 'anything', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'gripe', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'already', 'over', 'also', 'absolutely', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'never', 'once', 'get', 'verbal', 'cueing', 'what', 'next', 'also', 'annoying', 'Yeah', 'can', 'do', 'banter', 'Fortunately', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'fast', 'are', 'very', 'Beginner', 'Level', 'generally', 'repetitive', 'get', 'LOT', 'grapevines', 'step', 'touches', 'front', 'front', 'back', 'taps', 'one', 'foot', 'side', 'side', 'hip', 'shakes', 'counts', 'vary', 'example', 'one', 'set', ""'ll"", 'do', '4', 'hip', 'shakes', 'switching', 'next', 'move', 'set', ""'ll"", 'do', '8', 'switching', 'repetition', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'body', 'mind', 'will', 'probably', 'eventually', 'start', 'memorize', 'workout', 'have', 'covering', 'floor', 'space', 'moving', 'NON-STOP', '30', 'minutes', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'intense', 'previous', 'ones', 'mainly', 'one', 'little', 'slower', 'paced', 'lot', 'lower', 'impact', 'almost', 'hopping', 'feet', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'leave', 'floor', 'about', '95', '%', 'workout', 'However', 'are', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'tiny', 'bit', 'skipping', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'compared', 'hopping', 'jumping', 'done', 'other', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'So', 'whereas', 'previous', 'ones', 'actually', 'had', 'stop', 'certain', 'points', 'catch', 'breath', 'relieve', 'tired', 'legs', 'one', 'was', 'able', 'easily', 'get', 'stopping', 'fact', 'had', 'really', 'throw', 'moves', 'order', 'max', 'out', 'cardio', 'benefit', 'end', 'however', 'was', 'pretty', 'sweaty', 'felt', 'had', 'good', 'workout', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'favorite', 'workout', 'ever', 'world', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'different', 'cardio', 'workout', 'will', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'tire', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'However', 'order', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'have', 'WANT', 'move', 'music', 'nothing', 'enjoyed', 'warmup', 'music', 'once', 'beat', 'kicks', 'main', 'event', 'just', 'found', 'blah', 'Completely', 'uninspiring', 'solution', 'was', 'mute', 'dance', 'own', 'music', 'wonders', 'course', 'had', 'find', 'music', 'more', 'less', 'tempo', 'music', 'here', 'found', 'lot', 'EDM', 'pop', 'dance', 'remixes', 'fit', 'well', 'songs', 'like', 'use', 'right', 'now', 'include', 'Sexy', 'Chick', 'David', 'Guetta', 'Blow', 'Cirkut', 'Remix', 'Ke', 'ha', 'Levels', 'Avicii', 'one', 'remixes', 'Lights', 'Ellie', 'Goulding', 'forget', 'one', 'songs', 'are', 'close', 'not', 'perfect', 'fit', 'just', 'do', 'moves', 'beat', 'little', 'faster', 'TA', 'even', 'better', 'fun', ""'m"", 'motivated', 'just', 'move', 'hour']",Tracy Anderson: Dance+Cardio

I would say that I have a mixed review:Positives:* It is a pretty good workout.  Not overly strenuous but a solid workout.  I would put this as a middle of the road cardio workout.* I am definitely not a dance person but was able to keep up with the dvd with some work.Negatives* I did not like having no instructions.  This was different from other workouts that I have used.  Others may not mind this but it was not for me.  I wish that it had stated this on the cover.* It was fun at first but got boring as the workout went on.* I didn't really care for the music.* If I did get lost, it was difficult to recover.  A lot of the moves seemed a bit disjointed.In summary, I will probably give this one a few more tries.  If you are into dance, this may be exactly what you are looking for.
