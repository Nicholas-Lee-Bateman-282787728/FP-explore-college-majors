However, Cruise was able to convince me that he was Jack Reacher and I accepted his interpretation of this character, forgetting altogether who was doing the acting.  A good adventure story.

Directed by Christopher McQuarrie (an Oscar winner for writing the Screenplay to ""Usual Suspects""), ""Jack Reacher"" is a sharp, smart, intricate tale about a veteran Army MP officer Jack Reacher (Cruise), who in his retired civilian life lives as an off-the-grid drifter, aimlessly wandering from town to town, living off his pension, and using his investigative skills and street smarts to survive sticky situations. Reacher is summoned into Pittsburgh when one of his former military acquaintances, a former Army sniper named Barr, is framed for killing 5 innocents at a local square. Reacher is assigned as the primary investigator working alongside Barr's attorney Helen Rodin (persuasively played by gorgeous Rosamund Pike). Opposed to Reacher and Helen are the lead police investigator Det. Emerson (confidently played by Dvid Oyelowo) and the District Attorney Rodin (excellently played by film vet Richard Jenkins), who is also Helen's father. Also look out for a wonderful supporting turn by the great Robert Duvall!The film boasts a throwback style of summer action storytelling, reminding viewers more of 80s action vehicles rather than the CGI-heavy modern films. In fact, there is virtually no CGI (that I can tell) in any of the action and Cruise actually performs all his own stunts (in particular the fight scenes and car chase scene). Also, using a more traditional working class city like Pittsburgh as the film's setting really gives it a down-to-earth quality and charm that would have been absent had the film been shot in either New York or L.A.Cruise is extremely likable and convincing as a world-weary, insightful, intelligent tough guy, who also displays moments of true humanity at various points in the film. Reacher is great at ""reading"" people and sizing them up as soon as he meets them, and it comes across as entirely believable in Cruise's mannerisms. body language, and eye movement.

And you know what? I'm really glad I did.If you are a guy, even add a bonus half star. If you're a guy who likes Lee Child, the author who created the Jack Reacher persona, make it a full bonus star. And if you like movies likeRoad Houseand, heck, just about any Clint Eastwood flick, then what are you doing reading this review? Rent the movie already!This wasn't always the case: when news of Cruise's casting reached Child's fans, there was a good deal of disapproval, based largely on the diminutive star's height. But Cruise was Child's choice, and upon its release most fans recanted that opinion...and I must say I agree. Tom Cruise carries out the portrayal well, giving Reacher his characteristic full-on intensity and drive - and Cruise added to that persona by performing all of the driving stunts himself.Without giving away ANY plot details, I'll tell you this: the movie starts with a sinister, brutal action sequence and never really lets up, and that's saying something, because Cruise doesn't even show up for the first fifteen minutes. But when he does the movie doesn't skip a beat: Reacher's almost legendary loner-ism and unbreachable ""code"" is characterized extremely well by Cruise, and his strength of character really powers the film, making you believe that Reacher is a thinking man's John McClain, an almost mythical zen hero likeBilly Jackwas from the early 1970s.And it's not just Cruise that makes this film what it is: Werner Herzog makes an extremely wicked villain, and powerful supporting performances by the capable Rosamund Pike, the relatively unknown David Oyelowo, and the always marvelous Richard Jenkins really turn up the dramatic heat.And look for Robert Duvall to show up in an absolutely fantastic character role just when you've forgotten you saw his name in the credits.To conclude: while REACHER did not perform up to Cruise's typical box office clout, it did well enough (over $200 million internationally) to warrant an upcoming sequel (from Child's novelNever Go Back).

I have read the first one and could very easily get over this.When I watch a movie, one of my main requirements will be if the movie is entertaining. This movie was very entertaining. The characters were very believable and I was more impressed by the imperfections that were allowed in the characters rather than how perfect they were.  The women weren't perfect 10s and the men weren't all hunks. They came across as real.Cruse plays this part to perfection. I admire him for his ability to maintain his level of physical fitness for so many years. He is not that much younger than me and I have never seen him less than a perfect specimen. I know he probably has a team of servants to assist him in that and he has to pay for it, but his reward is years of employment as a leading man. His ability to play a character who can master hand to hand combat, which is used in this movie multiple times, is very believable.Robert Duvall rounds out the superstar cast as an old retired gunny running a rifle range. He is great in the movie and its easy to see why he is one of the best character actors in history.Overall a very good movie. Not a family movie mind you, but a good action packed adventure that is going to set Cruise up for for 2 or 3 more sequels to go along with all the other sequels he keeps going like a wizard.In this era of the movie industry, there seems to be a great emphasis on horror movies.

When he saw Sean Connery he called him a 'mumbling truck driver.' After Dr. No became a success, Ian had no problem with Connery. I only mention this so many people took umbrage over the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.That said, Jack Reacher is a damn good thriller. The production notes tell us Jack Reacher was filmed on 35 mm anamorphic format. In other words, old-school. No digital. No projection screens. The film has an early 70s vibe throughout and it's not hard to imagine Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen playing this role had it been around. Cruise ratchets his performance up to an eleven (as usual). The music is filled with nobility and the direction leaves you with no doubt you're watching a western played out in modern times. I liked the fact the film is devoid of the rapid-fire digital editing we've come to associate with the genre. I hesitate to call it an action film. Jack Reacher is more of a steady-paced thriller. I read a review somewhere that said most films today go to great lengths to hide the fact the actor is not doing his stunts but not Jack Reacher. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the car chase where the camera zooms into the car several times to show us that yes indeed, that is Tom Cruise doing his own stunts.Another thing worth mentioning is the character of Reacher is completely unsentimental and never second-guesses himself. As much as I enjoyed 'Skyfall,' it's refreshing to see a character who's not wracked with guilt. The next Bond film will have Bond on a therapist's couch. Seriously, Reacher is blunt, direct and remorseless. It's refreshing.Jack Reacher is well worth an evening's viewing.I hope they do Bad Luck and Trouble next. Here's my fantasy casting;Calvin Franz: Ed Norton. (What a great cameo.)Frances Neagley: Jennifer Garner.Stan Lowrey: Ben Affleck.Dave O'Donnell: Brad Pitt.Karla Dixon: No clue.

I went mostly out of curiosity:  I've read every Reacher novel written by Lee Child (some of them bought through Amazon) and loved them.I knew Child's Reacher and Cruise's would be different animals. Child's Reacher is 6' 5"", between 210 and 250 pounds in different books, and has a 50"" chest. Cruise is 5' 7"" and probably weighs, stripped down, between 140 and 150 pounds. Even as fighters (which is one of the things Jack Reacher has to do every so often), they'd fight differently -radically differently--because there's no way a 150 pound, 5' 7"" tall man could do some of the things an oversized behemoth like the original Reacher does. And though neat, like an ex-military man would be, Lee Child's Reacher is always a little scruffy: he buys his clothes one set at a time, throwing away the old ones, because he doesn't like to travel encumbered, and until then, he washes them out in the sink of whatever motel room he's staying in. Tom Cruise's Reacher exhibits the same behavior as Child's Reacher in this regard, but Cruise's Reacher always looks neat, just as Tom Cruise does himself.Enough carping on appearance. The critical question is how well does Cruise do as Reacher, and the answer is `okay.' Not great, not even near it, but okay, not a total embarrassment.Nor is the movie a total embarrassment. There is a good fight near the beginning when five local thugs take on Reacher to teach him a lesson. It's kind of comical watching little Tom Cruise mouth some of Reacher's words about how this is their last chance to get off without damage and how five to one odds are really three to one odds, because the last two will run away when they see what Reacher does to the first three, but the fight itself is swift, brutal, and most essential in a Reacher story, efficient. There is no waste effort, and avoiding waste effort is essential to the Reacher persona: he doesn't indulge in histrionics, he always uses the most direct efficient and quickest way to success in combat, like a good soldier would.What a shame then there's a second big fight because the movie butchers it. Reacher has come to the showdown against the bad guys. He's already warned one -a Russian sniper- that if he sees him again, he's going to hand him his lunch barehanded. So what happens? He gets the drop on the bad guy and is pointing an assault rifle right at his chest at close to zero range.  So Reacher/Cruise throws away his gun and rakes on the baddie mano a mano, in one of those generic fights we've seen in hundreds of other movies. There's also a car chase -what action movie would be complete without one?--that is boringly generic. We've seen it all too many times for it to be exciting except in the most mechanical, evanescent way.That's a problem with the whole movie. It's a generic action film. Some of Reacher's tics have been inserted -he doesn't talk a lot, he washes his clothes out in the sink and buys new ones and throws away the old ones when he's done with them, he has near eidetic memory, and most of the time you just know he's been in army for years by the way he acts--but behind it all, eliminate the tics and this could just as easily be Ethan Hawke, sans disguises and trickery, in any of the increasingly boring Mission Impossible movies that have kept Cruise a star.What's best in the movie? Old pros Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall milk their roles for all they are worthy and succeed in making them believable and enjoyable to watch.  Richard Jenkins does a good, not great job, as Good Lawyer Rosamund Pike's father (he's the D.A.).The Lee Childs novel that this movie was taken from (One Shot) was crisply plotted and everything Reacher does in it is thought out and efficient. This movie is just messy. Not horrible but not good either. Thus okay, no better than that.One other complaint: Cruise is starting to look old for this kind of movie. His body is still buff, but, as it was in the last Mission Impossible movie when he was on the outside of the Burj al Khalifa in Dubai with his shirt off, his muscles look like old muscles now, and his face is puffy in closeups. Cruise has shown in previous movies that he's a modestly competent actor. He needs to begin stretching himself before he winds up playing opposite Sly, Arnold, Bruce and Jean Claude in one of those retread Old Heroes movies.Lee Child says he likes Cruise as Reacher, but then Lee Child sold Cruise's production company the character franchise for the movies and I doubt he did it purely out of a conviction that Cruise was the perfect Reacher. Besides, Child used to work in advertising and we all know ad men occasionally bend the truth.",3,NOT AWFUL BUT NOT GREAT EITHER (2-1/2 * out of 5),1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,4790,"['JACK', 'REACHERTom', 'Cruise', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'others', 'including', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'Robert', 'DuvallI', 'saw', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'weekend', 'went', 'mostly', 'curiosity', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Reacher', 'novel', 'written', 'Lee', 'Child', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'loved', 'them.I', 'knew', 'Child', 'Reacher', 'Cruise', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'animals', 'Child', 'Reacher', '6', '5', '210', '250', 'pounds', 'different', 'books', '50', 'chest', 'Cruise', '5', '7', 'probably', 'weighs', 'stripped', 'down', '140', '150', 'pounds', 'Even', 'fighters', 'one', 'things', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'do', 'so', 'often', ""'d"", 'fight', 'differently', '-radically', 'differently', 'way', '150', 'pound', '5', '7', 'tall', 'man', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'oversized', 'behemoth', 'original', 'Reacher', 'neat', 'ex-military', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'Lee', 'Child', 'Reacher', 'always', 'little', 'scruffy', 'clothes', 'one', 'set', 'time', 'throwing', 'away', 'old', 'ones', ""n't"", 'like', 'travel', 'encumbered', 'then', 'out', 'sink', 'motel', 'room', 'staying', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Reacher', 'same', 'behavior', 'Child', 'Reacher', 'regard', 'Cruise', 'Reacher', 'always', 'neat', 'just', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'himself.Enough', 'carping', 'appearance', 'critical', 'question', 'how', 'well', 'Cruise', 'do', 'Reacher', 'answer', 'okay', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'even', 'okay', 'not', 'total', 'embarrassment.Nor', 'movie', 'total', 'embarrassment', 'good', 'fight', 'beginning', 'when', 'five', 'local', 'thugs', 'take', 'Reacher', 'teach', 'lesson', 'kind', 'comical', 'watching', 'little', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Reacher', 'words', 'how', 'last', 'chance', 'get', 'off', 'damage', 'how', 'five', 'one', 'odds', 'are', 'really', 'three', 'one', 'odds', 'last', 'two', 'will', 'run', 'away', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'Reacher', 'first', 'three', 'fight', 'swift', 'brutal', 'most', 'essential', 'Reacher', 'story', 'efficient', 'waste', 'effort', 'avoiding', 'waste', 'effort', 'essential', 'Reacher', 'persona', ""n't"", 'indulge', 'histrionics', 'always', 'most', 'direct', 'efficient', 'quickest', 'way', 'success', 'combat', 'good', 'soldier', 'would.What', 'shame', 'then', 'second', 'big', 'fight', 'movie', 'Reacher', 'come', 'showdown', 'bad', 'guys', 'already', 'warned', 'one', '-a', 'Russian', 'sniper-', 'again', 'going', 'hand', 'lunch', 'barehanded', 'what', 'drop', 'bad', 'guy', 'pointing', 'assault', 'rifle', 'right', 'chest', 'close', 'zero', 'range', 'So', 'Reacher/Cruise', 'away', 'gun', 'rakes', 'baddie', 'mano', 'one', 'generic', 'fights', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', 'also', 'car', 'chase', '-what', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'one', 'boringly', 'generic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'exciting', 'most', 'mechanical', 'evanescent', 'way.That', 'problem', 'whole', 'movie', 'generic', 'action', 'film', 'Reacher', 'tics', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', '-he', ""n't"", 'talk', 'lot', 'clothes', 'out', 'sink', 'new', 'ones', 'away', 'old', 'ones', 'when', 'done', 'eidetic', 'memory', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'know', 'been', 'army', 'years', 'way', 'eliminate', 'tics', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'disguises', 'trickery', 'increasingly', 'boring', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movies', 'have', 'kept', 'Cruise', 'star.What', 'best', 'movie', 'Old', 'pros', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'milk', 'roles', 'are', 'worthy', 'succeed', 'making', 'believable', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'job', 'Good', 'Lawyer', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'father', 'D.A', '.The', 'Lee', 'Childs', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'One', 'Shot', 'was', 'crisply', 'plotted', 'everything', 'Reacher', 'thought', 'out', 'efficient', 'movie', 'just', 'messy', 'Not', 'horrible', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'Thus', 'okay', 'better', 'that.One', 'other', 'complaint', 'Cruise', 'starting', 'look', 'old', 'kind', 'movie', 'body', 'still', 'buff', 'was', 'last', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'outside', 'Burj', 'al', 'Khalifa', 'Dubai', 'shirt', 'off', 'muscles', 'look', 'old', 'muscles', 'now', 'face', 'puffy', 'closeups', 'Cruise', 'shown', 'previous', 'movies', 'modestly', 'competent', 'actor', 'begin', 'stretching', 'up', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Sly', 'Arnold', 'Bruce', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'one', 'retread', 'Old', 'Heroes', 'movies.Lee', 'Child', 'Cruise', 'Reacher', 'then', 'Lee', 'Child', 'sold', 'Cruise', 'production', 'company', 'character', 'franchise', 'movies', 'doubt', 'did', 'purely', 'conviction', 'Cruise', 'was', 'perfect', 'Reacher', 'Besides', 'Child', 'used', 'work', 'advertising', 'know', 'ad', 'men', 'occasionally', 'bend', 'truth']",N/A

It struck me as an interesting plot with plenty of action, and violence as appropriate to the story, without the overdose of stress I sometimes feel when watching horrifically violent thriller-type movies. The actors seemed well-cast and did a good job. I should mention that I have never read the books, so I had no pre-set expectations.As a gun owner myself, I appreciated that despite some trumped-up tense moments at the shooting range, gun enthusiasts were not ultimately made out to be the bad guys and gun ownership was not painted as the entry step on some inevitable descent into violent psychosis. Reacher's clear-eyed summary of gun politics, and especially his comment about ""drain cleaner and swimming pools"" earned my total forgiveness for any mileage the film got out of us ""gun nuts.""The bad:It sure looked like the ""slam-dunk"" suspected sniper was drugged and had his hands already tied behind his back when the police burst into his house. Or maybe I just mis-interpreted the sequence of events somehow. Otherwise that needed some explaining.At one point the movie threatened to transform into a Three Stooges comedy for a minute or two. I had a good laugh at that scene, and appreciated the stress relief, yet it did not seem to fit with the rest of the film.The villain in this movie just seemed TOO villainous for the story. He was so mysterious, so evil, so ruthless, so efficient, so in control, so all-knowing, so scarred and deformed... This is the type of super villain we expect in a James Bond movie, one set on nuclear mayhem or knocking the moon out of orbit, not one wanting to strong-arm a local business.On the whole, the flaws were very minor and I enjoyed the movie.

Not having read the book this viewer found the film intensely engrossing, full of smart dialogue form writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and a finely tuned cast of actors who get the opportunity to strut their stuff in this story that seems far shorter than the 130 minutes of the film. Tom Cruise may be short in stature at 5'7"" but at age 50 he is in fine shape, performs all his own car stunts (which are excellent and harrowing), and at least for the novice he does `become' Jack Reacher.Briefly, the setting is Pittsburgh, PA and a professional sniper (an exceptionally fine Jai Courtney) shoots dead five seemingly random people. The police quickly capture on James Barr (Joseph Sikora), arrest him, interrogate him (by DA Richard Jenkins and his cohort David Oyelowo and the DA's lawyer daughter Rosamund Pike who seeks to give Barr a fair trial): Barr declares his innocence and his answer to his question of is he guilty is his writing `Get Jack Reacher'. Barr is beaten unconscious in a van on the way to jail and is comatose.  Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator, (Tom Cruise) who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history appears and the action begins. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a second look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.In addition to the actors mention, there are several excellent cameos by Werner Herzog as a Russian ex-prisoner who knows about survival (he chewed of his own fingers while I prison to ward off gangrene from frost bite), Alexia Fast, Josh Helman, Vladimir Sizov, and Robert Duvall. The story is rich in innuendoes, insights into corporate greed and threats form outside sources to take over the country, and some serious chases both by car and on foot.  The brilliant cinematography is by Caleb Deschanel and the atmosphere is greatly enhanced by the musical score by Joe Kraemer.  But this is a Tom Cruise special and he proves he can still rule the roost as one of the top action heroes in the business. For this genre, this is a fine entertainment.

Of course, after you know the whole story it doesn't play backwards particularly well since it seems like an overly-complicated plot after you've seen the twists and turns.Jack Reacher is an interesting if one-dimensional hero who comes out of nowhere, acts outsides the boundaries of the law and uses his near-supernatural intelligence to separate the good guys from the bad. Still, with Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) directing, it's tightly paced and keeps the action moving so you'll rarely stop to notice some of the craziness of what's happening. Cruise is quite good as always although he can practically phone in the performance on this one.

1571140,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008N6YTL4,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[191, 215]","The main complaint I heard and read before JACK REACHER ever even hit theatres was from fans of Lee Child's series of books about this film's titular character, and it was always the same complaint: ""Tom Cruise is too short! Jack Reacher is 6'5"" and is built like a brick outhouse!!"" And my response to that was always: ""Can you think of an actor who's really good, does action well, has a lot of charisma, and IS ACTUALLY built like that?""Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-Winning screenwriter of Bryan Singer's unforgettable THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and the writer/director of the very forgettable THE WAY OF THE GUN, picked up his pen and got back behind the camera for this potential franchise first outing for the cinematic adventures of Jack Reacher (Cruise), former Army military police investigator. He's, as they say in the film, a ghost. He has no fixed address, no credit cards, no phone number. In fact, the only proof of his existence is a bank account, his military record, and his military pension. He buys his clothes from Goodwill as needed and donates the old ones, hops on a bus, and goes wherever the day takes him. But in a very disturbing and wordless opening sequence, a man with a military-grade sniper rifle shoots five people in front of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. All the clues lead back to Army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora, who spends most of the film in a coma) as a man who just snapped. The lead District Attorney (the great Richard Jenkins) is pushing for the death penalty, but the defense attorney for Barr, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) is looking to stop that from happening. It also happens that Helen is the daughter of the DA. When told to confess, with all the convenient evidence stacked against him, Barr only has one thing to tell them: ""Get Jack Reacher"". Once Reacher comes on the scene, he is fully aware of what's been going on, but uncertain as to why Barr asked for him, because he fully believes that Barr is guilty. Nevertheless, Reacher ends up working as an investigator for Helen, and runs afoul of the real reason those people were killed, and uses all his skills and investigative talents to find the truth.It's true that this film is a little thin on character development. We know just enough about each character to keep the momentum going forward, but no more than that. Character motivation gets even less time. For all intents and purposes, this film feels more like a throwback to 80's detective thrillers, but with a smarter and more modern sensibility. McQuarrie seems much more assured behind the camera here than I've seen before, and he creates a labrinythian mystery here that feels organic as Reacher follows up on each clue, and Cruise seems to be having a good time playing a character that is somewhat out of step with the outside world, but always seems to be able to see the angles played against him. It's also true that some quality actors seem a little wasted here, with the only real exceptions being Pike, a menacing Jai Courtney (SPARTACUS) as the villain's right-hand man and a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a retired Marine and shooting range owner who ends up coming along for the ride. Actors like Michael Raymond James (TERRIERS, TRUE BLOOD), Jenkins, and David Oyelowo (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) are kind of shafted. Even famed director Werner Herzog, the real villain of the piece, is more of a cartoonishly creepy villain. Also true, apparently, to huge fans of this series, that the film in no real way resembles the book this film is based on, which is the ninth book in the series called ONE SHOT.Why then do I give this film a 4 out of 5?Because this was an incredibly fun film. I like protagonists that are on the outside looking in, and always seem to have that extra step ahead. Jack Reacher is very much kin to 24's Jack Bauer; they are both renegades, they're both very smart, they're both men of serious action, they follow justice and not the law, and if people would only listen to them, things would be over a lot quicker. Although, Reacher has a much more evident sense of humor than Jack Bauer ever did. He has some terrific zingers along the way here, particularly in a 5-on-1 fight scene. He also carries himself with an assuredness that is rare to see in a modern action hero. Most films at present have the heroes of the film constantly questioning themselves. Are they up to the task? Can they be the hero the people involved need? Can they win the day without compromising their values? JACK REACHER as a film and as a character throw those discussions to the wayside in favor of a more entertaining romp as opposed to a more navel-gazing reluctant hero that seem to dominate films of late. The pace of the film also seems nicely breezy as well, which has a bit of a mismatch of tone that the opening of the film would have us believe. While it's a long-ish film, it doesn't seem long at all.I understand people's frustration with this film, but I don't subscribe to it because when it comes right down to it, I enjoyed the hell out of JACK REACHER, but if the box office indications are worth anything, it's unlikely I'll see more of his adventures on the big screen.",4,"Smart, fun, well-paced detective/actioner, but leave

But had to stop watching after about 20 minutes because it actually woke me up more. Following up the next day to finish it was a good idea.I have not read the Jack Reacher books. So I cannot compare Mr. Cruise's rendition to that of the book. But now I want to read the books. Somehow his compulsion to do what's right reminds me of Spock's compulsion to be logical, or Odd Thomas' compulsions. The Reacher character feels like those two characters in some way. Not &#34;elemental,&#34; but, &#34;in its groove.&#34; Not sure how else to describe it.Tom Cruise's performance reminded me of so many of the outstanding movies of his earlier career.

As I write this, 3,720 have already reviewed the 2012 Tom Cruise action/adventure film JACK REACHER.What the heck.  But I will keep it brief, more notes than a coherent summary.While there is much to admire about JACK REACHER, Tom Cruise's performance stands front and center.  Not that someone else playing the role would do such a bad job that he'd drag it down, but Cruise's take on the title character projects wisdom where other actors might have thought it appropriate to come across as arrogant. See JACK REACHER and maybe you'll agree Cruise's way makes it that much more affecting.  Bravo,Tom.JACK REACHER is the first Tom Cruise film I'd seen since THE LAST SAMURAI, which he made nine years earlier, except for his scene-stealing cameo in the 2008 comedy TROPIC THUNDER.With all his success, now Cruise can ride the Reacher role for a couple of good sequels.  All those hit movies, then the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series, and now this.  Tom Cruise has his next divorce or two paid in advance.While I certainly admired his acting in a number of roles going all the way back to the crazy cadet he played in the 1981 film TAPS,  Cruise's JACK REACHER performance is so good I plan to view the film again.  Reading through his credits, that has not happened before even though I liked TAPS, RISKY BUSINESS, RAIN MAN, MINORITY REPORT, and so many others.How cool that there is a good role for Robert Duvall in JACK REACHER.  This makes up for DAYS OF THUNDER, starring Cruise with Duvall supporting.  I hated that one.With JACK REACHER, Tom Cruise seems to have shed the last of his boyishness.

1571181,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B008N6YTL4,Joseph M. Reninger,"[1, 1]","Jack Reacher is based on the novel One Shot by Lee Child. It is part of a series of novels featuring Jack Reacher. They are all stand-alone adventures, not requiring knowledge of previous books for enjoyment. Reacher is an ex-military man drifting around America with the clothes on his back, a tooth brush, and an ATM card. He typically gets involved in some criminal activity when he runs into a victim who appeals to his sense of justice or a criminal who appalls his sense of justice. I've listened to three of the stories as audiobooks and found them exciting and enjoyable. But not One Shot. I was looking forward to a film version of the character, imagining Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock, in the main role.What Jack Reacher has is the more controversial casting choice of Tom Cruise. Certainly Cruise is a more bankable star, but Reacher is a taller, younger, and tougher character than the contemporary Cruise tough guy. Most fans of the novels groaned at the casting decision, but Hollywood runs on numbers, not on faithfulness to fan expectations. A related worry for fans was that the rest of the movie would be run by numbers rather than by the delightful craftsmanship found in the novels.As for Cruise, I can see how people who haven't read the books would be satisfied with his performance. He does have the charisma and the toughness to deliver a great action character. He suggests the physicality through looks and voice quite well. I still wasn't fully satisfied, but Cruise performed well.The story was interesting though moments of it fell into cliche. The overall conspiracy didn't quite hold together and the finale wound up showing too many recycled bits from 1980s action films. Not the good bits, either. The movie ran too much according to numbers than to good storytelling, resulting in a mediocre action picture. Which would be okay, if I didn't know the source material well enough to know how far short they fell from the mark.",3,Disappointing for book fans but okay for others,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,1958,"['Jack', 'Reacher', 'based', 'novel', 'One', 'Shot', 'Lee', 'Child', 'part', 'series', 'novels', 'featuring', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'are', 'stand-alone', 'adventures', 'not', 'requiring', 'knowledge', 'previous', 'books', 'enjoyment', 'Reacher', 'ex-military', 'man', 'drifting', 'America', 'clothes', 'back', 'tooth', 'brush', 'ATM', 'card', 'typically', 'involved', 'criminal', 'activity', 'when', 'victim', 'who', 'appeals', 'sense', 'justice', 'criminal', 'who', 'sense', 'justice', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'three', 'stories', 'audiobooks', 'found', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'One', 'Shot', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'version', 'character', 'imagining', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Rock', 'main', 'role.What', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'more', 'controversial', 'casting', 'choice', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Certainly', 'Cruise', 'more', 'bankable', 'star', 'Reacher', 'taller', 'younger', 'tougher', 'character', 'contemporary', 'Cruise', 'tough', 'guy', 'Most', 'fans', 'novels', 'groaned', 'casting', 'decision', 'Hollywood', 'numbers', 'not', 'faithfulness', 'fan', 'expectations', 'related', 'worry', 'fans', 'was', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'run', 'numbers', 'rather', 'delightful', 'craftsmanship', 'found', 'novels.As', 'Cruise', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'performance', 'have', 'charisma', 'toughness', 'deliver', 'great', 'action', 'character', 'physicality', 'looks', 'voice', 'quite', 'well', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'satisfied', 'Cruise', 'performed', 'well.The', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'moments', 'fell', 'cliche', 'overall', 'conspiracy', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'together', 'finale', 'wound', 'up', 'showing', 'too', 'many', 'recycled', 'bits', '1980s', 'action', 'films', 'Not', 'good', 'bits', 'either', 'movie', 'ran', 'too', 'much', 'according', 'numbers', 'good', 'storytelling', 'resulting', 'mediocre', 'action', 'picture', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'source', 'material', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'short', 'fell', 'mark']",N/A

Reacher is 6'5&#34; tall and very physically intimidating, also very calm and controlled. His size and mannerisms are so integral to the entire book and it's story line, that changing it devalues the story. Had Tom Cruise simply made this movie as a different character, or used a different name, it would have been a four or five star movie. As is, the movie only teases you with the idea of how cool a movie with &#34;real&#34; Jack reacher, as written, would have been. Using Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is as silly, and would make as much of a difference in the movie, as putting Peter Sellers (as Inspector Clouseau) trying to seriously play a Clint Eastwood (as Dirty Harry) role. You are a great actor, Mr. Cruise, but this role is just beyond you (you are so very talented that you can pull off a role that many would expect you not to pull off well (Lestat comes to mind; great work there) but here it is like you trying to play Whoopie Goldbergs character in the Color Purple).

Refreshingly, Jack Reacher, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is full of compelling characters.  The protagonist, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an Army Iraq war veteran.  He lives off the grid, treating it as a bit of a game.  In one line, Jack says being un-locatable became an addiction.  He can only be found when he wants to be found.  So when five people are killed in a random sniper shooting, the suspect (Joseph Sikora) asks for Reacher.  In what seems an open and shut case, the only cogs in the wheel of justice are the DA's daughter Helen (Rosamund Pike), and Reacher, who hates the suspect's guts, yet can't resist a good mystery to solve.As in many films today, the villains are more compelling than the heroes.  This is the case here, as &#34;The Zec&#34; (Werner Hertzog) is mesmerizing and has much better lines than Reacher.  Actually, some of Reacher's lines were almost cringe-inducing.  &#34;I am going to make you drink your blood out of a boot.&#34;  Oh.  Okey-dokey, then.  My other gripe is that Pike has a permanent expression of surprise glued on her face for most of the movie.

Barbier ""The Cocoli Kid""","[3, 4]","The character of Jack Reacher developed by Lee Child hits the big silver screen with Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in a real blockbuster! Tom Cruise of course looks nothing like the book character. But he plays the role of Jack Reacher with gusto and because of the professional that he is he delivers 100% in the role. He is dynamite and nitroglycerine combined as he takes on all the bad guys to bring justice out of chaos. The story begins with a sniper in a parking garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shooting across a river to kill randomly. That is what the initial police investigators conclude. But as the clues are reviewed and the dots are connected nothing is what it seems. There is a criminal conspiracy at work here with an old Army sniper being framed for the killings.  But did he really do it? If you read the book, which this film was adapted from than you know how it all ends. But I always love to see if the film meets all my expectations. In this case the actors both the good ones and the bad ones did a very commendable job. Of course Tom Cruise stole the show! The adaptation was very honest and the film with fewer explosions adhered very well to the book. I would reveal the story&#8217;s source but I leave that up to each of you to figure out. Besides the character of Jack Reacher is more of a cerebral type of guy. He solves the problems first in his mind from what he knows based on the facts he receives as he works the crime scenes and then when it comes to action he does not hesitate to get it done! I also enjoyed seeing that great actor Robert Duvall playing a role of a retired Gunnery Sergeant owner of a gun range. In his own right he provide a nice balance for Tom Cruise in those scenes.  A movie's highlight is an excellent car chase scene between two roaring muscle cars on the dark streets of Pittsburgh with Cruise clearly and expertly handling the wheel himself. A capable English actress Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike plays the defense attorney for the accused. She is good and in the scenes she is in both Tom Cruise also provides great balance. Oh, have you figured out the name of the book in which Jack Reacher was adapted? No, not to worry you will have plenty of time to do that after you see the movie. If you think the credits will reveal the answer...wrong. You will never find it in the credits. I highly recommend this movie! If you are a Jack Reacher fan then you won't want to miss it. The movie will soon be out in DVD but if you can't wait then you can see it on Amazon.com in Instant video. I gave it five stars because adapting this movie to the big screen from a book that is filled with details seemed like an insurmountable task but all concern made the impossible look easy. It was an honest interpretation of why some people let greed take over their lives and become a destructive force in human relations. There is a great lesson there in that we reap what we sow!  Every act has consequences. If you plant good seed then you will have a great harvest. But the opposite is also true! The movie Jack Reacher gives us all a lesson in righteousness and how evil actions will bite you when you least expect it come hell or high water or as in no matter what happens and whatever may come you; you are in it for the long haul&#8230;that is what life is all about.",5,Jack Reacher the Movie,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3327,"['character', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'developed', 'Lee', 'Child', 'big', 'silver', 'screen', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'real', 'blockbuster', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'course', 'nothing', 'book', 'character', 'role', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'gusto', 'professional', '100', '%', 'role', 'dynamite', 'nitroglycerine', 'combined', 'bad', 'guys', 'bring', 'justice', 'chaos', 'story', 'sniper', 'parking', 'garage', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'shooting', 'river', 'kill', 'randomly', 'what', 'initial', 'police', 'investigators', 'conclude', 'clues', 'are', 'reviewed', 'dots', 'are', 'connected', 'nothing', 'what', 'criminal', 'conspiracy', 'work', 'here', 'old', 'Army', 'sniper', 'being', 'framed', 'killings', 'did', 'really', 'do', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'know', 'how', 'always', 'love', 'see', 'film', 'expectations', 'case', 'actors', 'good', 'ones', 'bad', 'ones', 'did', 'very', 'commendable', 'job', 'course', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'stole', 'show', 'adaptation', 'was', 'very', 'honest', 'film', 'fewer', 'explosions', 'adhered', 'very', 'well', 'book', 'would', 'reveal', 'story', '8217', 's', 'source', 'leave', 'up', 'figure', 'out', 'character', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'more', 'cerebral', 'type', 'guy', 'problems', 'first', 'mind', 'what', 'based', 'facts', 'crime', 'scenes', 'then', 'when', 'action', 'not', 'hesitate', 'get', 'done', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'great', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'playing', 'role', 'retired', 'Gunnery', 'Sergeant', 'owner', 'gun', 'range', 'own', 'right', 'provide', 'nice', 'balance', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'scenes', 'movie', 'highlight', 'excellent', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'two', 'roaring', 'muscle', 'cars', 'dark', 'streets', 'Pittsburgh', 'Cruise', 'clearly', 'expertly', 'handling', 'wheel', 'capable', 'English', 'actress', 'Rosamund', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Pike', 'defense', 'attorney', 'accused', 'good', 'scenes', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'also', 'great', 'balance', 'Oh', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'name', 'book', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'was', 'adapted', 'No', 'not', 'worry', 'will', 'have', 'plenty', 'time', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'think', 'credits', 'will', 'reveal', 'answer', 'wrong', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'credits', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'fan', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'movie', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'out', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'Amazon.com', 'Instant', 'video', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'adapting', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'book', 'filled', 'details', 'seemed', 'insurmountable', 'task', 'concern', 'made', 'impossible', 'look', 'easy', 'was', 'honest', 'interpretation', 'why', 'people', 'let', 'greed', 'take', 'over', 'lives', 'become', 'destructive', 'force', 'human', 'relations', 'great', 'lesson', 'there', 'reap', 'what', 'sow', 'Every', 'act', 'consequences', 'plant', 'good', 'seed', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'harvest', 'opposite', 'also', 'true', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'lesson', 'righteousness', 'how', 'evil', 'actions', 'will', 'bite', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'come', 'are', 'long', 'haul', '8230', 'what', 'life']",N/A

Some interesting fight sequences that I haven't seen done quite in the same way before, a nice sprinkling of mystery to keep the plot engaging, and great acting all the way around.Now I haven't read the book, but understand many who bemoan that Cruise just doesn't fit the fantasy of Jack Reacher in their head. I honestly don't think Cruise is really anyone's fantasy. He's short with a funny nose and with an embarrassingly obnoxious personal life. But give credit where credit is due--he manages to pull off the fight scenes just fine by making it clear that it's not about height or strength, but about precision, intelligence and practice. He also happens to be a great actor so watching the bits in between the action is also a pleasure. And honestly, I could have cared less whether it was someone who looked like Thor or not in this role. While there is a nice chemistry with the defense attorney woman, it's never overly sexual and this movie managed to not need the ""will they or won't they"" subplot that most action movies do. It's about the action, plot and characters and didn't need to have a hot make-out session to hold my interest, therefore no need to have someone super attractive in the lead role either.I honestly really enjoyed this movie. Didn't blow my mind, but was certainly a cut above most of the action films that have come out recently. And interestingly, the whole Army element gave this movie a sense of believability that is lacking in most action films. I could actually see parts of this movie being able to happen in real life which was sort of fascinating as normally I just resign myself to checking my mind at the door.

Actually found her to be significantly distracting from the film.  Tom's lines are at times quite contrived. Some good action sequences make a 3-star.I apologize, this is now a 2-star movie.  I just finished watching it (the first review was about 3/4 the way through when I had to do some work and take a break).  The lead actress continued to bring down the film with her poor acting and ridiculously poorly written lines. Cruise's dialog continued downhill and the plot became really dull...as dull as you can get and still have decent action scenes.A 2 at best.  Makes me wonder if this was just a scientology run picture rather than one that had good writers, directors, etc.  I know Cruise was the exec. producer, so ?.....UPDATE:Okay, so this movie is now available for free through Amazon Prime so I decided to give it another chance.I stand by my evaluation of the female lead.  I honestly cannot stand the vapid, constantly surprised look she has during the whole movie.  I mean, eyebrows raised high, always talking in forced whispers, and that's literally ALL her character does. Irritating, annoying, just plain weird. Its like they tried to add drama to a scene by asking her to ""be really dramatic"". And the fact that they made her have this weird ""attraction"" to Tom from the get-go...also a very awkward somewhat non sequitur aspect to the script. Felt like it was put it in just for Cruise's ego.  I would be quite happy to not see a movie with her in it again.Again, I will say there are some pretty good action sequences, with the bar fight being one of the better ones.  Except one that sticks in my mind: the finale (slight spoiler alert) where Robert Duvall is sniping from 300+ yards away...in the dark... and during the sequence, somehow the bad guys who are standing in the bright lights are shooting right at him with their machine guns while alternating to Tom behind a rock 50 feet away. All you could see of Duvall was a tiny muzzle flash when he shot (seemingly 500+ yards away at that time), but the bad guys were popping 3 or 4 shots in a row right at him and hitting within inches every shot...with machine guns.Still a 2 star because of decent action.

1571271,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B008N6YTL4,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[627, 693]","Wolverine, the most popular of the X-Men and one of the most popular comic book characters in comic book history is also one of the shortest. According to thirty plus years of continuous publication, Logan - AKA wolverine - is 5'2"" tall and somewhere around 200 lbs, with metal infused skeleton and claws, and a back as hairy as a Kodiak bear. When X-Men director Bryan Singer cast a slim 6'3"" song-and-dance man named Hugh Jackman to play the short stocky Wolverine, comic book geeks everywhere said ""What the f***?""Now anyone familiar with the Jack Reacher novels written by Lee Child knows that main character of the novels is a 6'5"" 250 pound blond haired blue eye bruiser with the face of a professional rugby player. And likewise anyone who read the novels must have said ""What the f***?"" upon learning that the diminutive Tom Cruise was cast to play Jack Reacher. ""He's too small. He's too Pretty."" My wife, who's a huge fan of Lee Child's novels, was so irritated with the casting choice that she refused the see the movie.For those of you not familiar with Lee Child's novels, the title character is military veteran who hobos around America with nothing but the clothes on his back and the money in his pocket. He avoids relationships, responsibilities and even posessions that might tie him down. He doesn't even own a suitcase. When his clothes get dirty he throws them away and buys new cloths. He rides from town to town on Greyhound busses. He generally minds his own business, but always seems to find himself at the center of a mystery or conspiracy that requires his investigative instinct and brutal hand-to-hand skills to solve.The movie begins with a sniper shooting down four people in Pittsburg. The evidence quickly points to James Barr, a former Army sniper with a disturbing past. But maybe the evidence points at Barr too quickly. No sooner is Barr taken into custody when his is beaten nearly to death by other convicts and left in a coma. Now the mystery becomes one of whether Barr will even come out of his coma to be put on trial. Enter Jack Reacher, a former military policeman who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a 2nd look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.Well, having just seen Jack Reacher at my local theater, it seems that the miscast Tom Cruise somehow made it work just as a miscast Hugh Jackman made Wolverine work. Cruise is believable as a retired military policeman who really doesn't care and just wants to move on. Tom Cruise may not be my favorite actor (I would have preferred James Caviezal) but he is a superbly skilled actor who knew just how to play the character. The movie also benefitted from a tightly written script which solidly conveys Lee Child's vision of the hardened cynical soldier turned drifter. It also managed to give us just enough backs story without getting bogged down in exposition.One last thing: Jack Reacher sports about the best fight choreography I've seen since Watchmen.  I've had a few years of training in Wing Chun and a couple more in some other styles.  I'm not easily impressed, but the moves Cruise used on the bad guys were a hell of a lot more realistic than most movie viewers will be used to.As for the diminutive Cruise playing the man-giant Reacher...6'5""...5'6""...what's the difference?",4,Not what I expected...Cruise nails it.,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,3473,"['Wolverine', 'most', 'popular', 'X-Men', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'comic', 'book', 'history', 'also', 'one', 'shortest', 'According', 'thirty', 'plus', 'years', 'continuous', 'publication', 'Logan', 'AKA', 'wolverine', '5', '2', 'tall', 'somewhere', '200', 'lbs', 'metal', 'infused', 'skeleton', 'claws', 'back', 'as', 'hairy', 'Kodiak', 'bear', 'When', 'X-Men', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'cast', 'slim', '6', '3', 'song-and-dance', 'man', 'named', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'play', 'short', 'stocky', 'Wolverine', 'comic', 'book', 'geeks', 'everywhere', 'said', 'What', 'f***', 'Now', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'novels', 'written', 'Lee', 'Child', 'main', 'character', 'novels', '6', '5', '250', 'pound', 'blond', 'haired', 'blue', 'eye', 'bruiser', 'face', 'professional', 'rugby', 'player', 'likewise', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'novels', 'must', 'have', 'said', 'What', 'f***', 'learning', 'diminutive', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'cast', 'play', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'too', 'small', 'too', 'Pretty', 'wife', 'who', 'huge', 'fan', 'Lee', 'Child', 'novels', 'was', 'so', 'irritated', 'casting', 'choice', 'refused', 'see', 'movie.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'Lee', 'Child', 'novels', 'title', 'character', 'military', 'veteran', 'who', 'hobos', 'America', 'nothing', 'clothes', 'back', 'money', 'pocket', 'relationships', 'responsibilities', 'even', 'posessions', 'might', 'tie', 'down', ""n't"", 'even', 'own', 'suitcase', 'When', 'clothes', 'get', 'away', 'new', 'cloths', 'town', 'town', 'Greyhound', 'busses', 'generally', 'own', 'business', 'always', 'find', 'center', 'mystery', 'conspiracy', 'investigative', 'instinct', 'brutal', 'hand-to-hand', 'skills', 'solve.The', 'movie', 'sniper', 'shooting', 'down', 'four', 'people', 'Pittsburg', 'evidence', 'quickly', 'points', 'James', 'Barr', 'former', 'Army', 'sniper', 'disturbing', 'past', 'maybe', 'evidence', 'points', 'Barr', 'too', 'quickly', 'sooner', 'Barr', 'taken', 'custody', 'when', 'beaten', 'nearly', 'death', 'other', 'convicts', 'left', 'coma', 'Now', 'mystery', 'one', 'Barr', 'will', 'even', 'come', 'coma', 'be', 'put', 'trial', 'Enter', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'former', 'military', 'policeman', 'who', 'Jack', 'Barr', 'shared', 'military', 'history', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'believe', 'Barr', 'did', 'crime', 'accused', 'when', 'Local', 'criminals', 'try', 'take', 'out', 'Reacher', 'give', 'case', '2nd', 'look', 'Soon', 'unraveling', 'much', 'deeper', 'conspiracy.Well', 'having', 'just', 'seen', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'local', 'theater', 'miscast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'somehow', 'made', 'work', 'just', 'miscast', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'made', 'Wolverine', 'work', 'Cruise', 'believable', 'retired', 'military', 'policeman', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'move', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'favorite', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'James', 'Caviezal', 'superbly', 'skilled', 'actor', 'who', 'knew', 'just', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'movie', 'also', 'benefitted', 'tightly', 'written', 'script', 'solidly', 'conveys', 'Lee', 'Child', 'vision', 'hardened', 'cynical', 'soldier', 'turned', 'drifter', 'also', 'managed', 'give', 'just', 'enough', 'backs', 'story', 'getting', 'bogged', 'down', 'exposition.One', 'last', 'thing', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'sports', 'best', 'fight', 'choreography', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Watchmen', ""'ve"", 'had', 'few', 'years', 'training', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'couple', 'more', 'other', 'styles', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'impressed', 'moves', 'Cruise', 'used', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'most', 'movie', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'to.As', 'diminutive', 'Cruise', 'playing', 'man-giant', 'Reacher', '6', '5', '5', '6', 'what', 'difference']",N/A

Christopher McQuarrie both wrote and directed the film. A sniper goes on a killing spree in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 5 unrelated people in broad daylight. Clues at the scene lead police detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) to arrest former army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora), and District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) charges him with the crime. Barr refuses to speak to investigators but makes a single, written statement: ""Get Jack Reacher"". Reacher was a much-decorated MP investigator who knew Barr in the army. Barr's defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) assumes, incorrectly, that Reacher will be a character witness. In fact, Reacher dislikes Barr but is not satisfied with the evidence against him.I haven't read Lee Child's ""Jack Reacher"" books, so I don't know why this one, which is in the middle of the series, was chosen for the film or how much it may have been altered. But all of the characters in this movie are cartoons, the dialogue is conspicuously terrible to the point that it made me cringe, the plot is ridiculous at every turn, and we never understand any of the villains' motives. If that weren't bad enough, the female lead, defense attorney Helen Rodin, is dreadfully miscast. She is supposed to be a trial lawyer. Trial lawyers have strong personalities, and they do not show cleavage in the office. Helen doesn't even have a personality. Rosamund Pike's breathy voice sounds like a low-rent night club chanteuse who constantly flirts with customers. This is ridiculous on a lawyer. And the film runs too long at 2 hours, 10 minutes.But ""Jack Reacher"" shows us what a movie star is. Tom Cruise doesn't have the physical stature of Lee Child's Jack Reacher, but he sure has the screen presence. The man is 50 years old, and he is totally convincing as a smart, fist-pounding, gun-toting vigilante action hero. He's a movie star. He makes the audience want to watch him, even if we must endure the next ridiculous scene and torrent of corny dialogue to do it. I'm impressed. Tom Cruise's charisma can sometimes carry this movie. But Cruise is the only thing in ""Jack Reacher"" that is watchable. The only good thing I can say about McQuarrie's direction is that the omission of dialogue for the first 8 minutes works well. The film was a box office success, so the writers may get another crack at this character if it is to be a franchise. They have a great male lead. The rest of the package will need a lot of work.",3,Tom Cruise Is Terrific.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Jack is a powerful man trying to do the right thing, and he doesn't care about the rules. There's a basic flaw in that philosophy which the movie doesn't address, and that's probably part of why the reviews weren't great. In addition, the supporting characters, with the exception of the female lead, were pretty straightforward, and the relationships not very complex, either.Here's my Achilles heel: I like to win easy.

But the truth is, that could just as easily be about me rather than the movie. In fact the entire reason for writing a review is I keep them so I can easily check to see if I've watched something... If I've written a review... which I didn't do the first time.A man is framed for a murder and it seems open and shut case  He asks for Jack Reacher who is a ghost, not to be found.  But he shows up right on cue, out of the blue.  That's where we get our first good look at Rosamund Pike (Helen, the attorney for the accused).  Oh my.  I must not have been paying attention the first time I watched.  This woman is a beauty.  How I didn't notice the first time around is a shame on me.  It really is standard action/adventure fare as Jack Reacher beats his way into more and more information, until he draws the attention of the real killer who then sets up Reacher as well as the first framed murder.  Then Jack is defending the innocent while also trying to keep his own hide from law enforcement.That's all I'll say, Tom Cruise is the hero... action/adventure fans should put 2 and 2 together there-after.Lee Child wrote a number of Jack Reacher books, and while I haven't read any I'm confident there is plenty of material to have this become a franchise with several movies.I offered 7 on IMDB, 4 here on Amazon, where I watched it btw.

As an action hero, Tom Cruise brought 4 ""Mission Impossible"" movies to the screen to the tune of $2Billion total for the franchise and established himself as an action hero even before that with SciFi epics like ""Minority Report"" and ""War of the Worlds"", and more recently ""Oblivion"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"", among others.  Jack Reacher fans know author Child's physical description of Mr Reacher very well: really big, tall, muscular, strong, and smart. So Cruise taking on such an admired tough guy role in Jack Reacher brings ""muscular, strong, and smart"" to the role, but even author Child was won over in the end. My one encounter with Jack Reacher was years ago in Lee Child's book ""The Hard Way: A Jack Reacher Novel"" and Cruise is not the Jack Reacher-type specified there. Nonetheless, Hollywood sometimes has a way of making it work, amid the many failures of other actors and roles, and Cruise works himself comfortably into the role as the movie proceeds. He is considerably helped along by the contrasts with some nasty bad guys and some nice acting and eye-candy from British actress Rosamund Pike. Also, there is a surprise cameo by one of our greatest actors who 'ups the ante' considerably while getting some GREAT one-liners to emote: I won't identify him but his casting was brilliant and the interaction between this actor and Cruise is excellent. The film's slow pace drags at times, but persevering to the end will pay off in the climactic face-offs. Then the writer leaves a Reacher 'calling card' at the very end.

1571402,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B008N6YTL4,Sky,"[1, 1]","Back in December 2012 when Jack Reacher was released I figured, ""why not read the book then watch the movie when it comes out on Blu Ray?"" The movie is actually based onOne Shot, the 2005 9th book in Lee Child's series. One Shot was an excellent book, and I pictured a Tom Cruise-like character as Reacher knowing that I would soon be watching him in the role.Cruise did a decent job with the portrayal of Reacher in the movie. He nailed the dialogue. However, Cruise would be a much smaller Reacher than that of the guy in the book who stands 6'5"" and in one chapter literally crushes a guy the size of Stallone in his bare hands. I actually noticed that they made Cruise seem as tall as some of his co-stars in several scenes, which made some of the CQC seem a bit more realistic.Anyway, the movie was a very good adaptation of the book. Reacher is a rough, tough character with a military police background. Now ""retired"" and for the most part a drifter, Reacher seems to be as much of a military police expert as he is an expert in finding trouble and fixing it. However, now as an ""independent"", unlike the traditional methods used by police, Reacher--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.Jack Reacher learns that a guy that he used to be in the military with is accused of an atrocious crime. So Reacher makes his way to Pittsburgh (Indiana in the book)  to investigate. Turns out the guy accused of the atrocity asked the cops to ""find Reacher"" as one of the only statements after his arrest, because Reacher may be the only guy that could put doubt behind the accusation. This of course doesn't make Reacher any friends in the local police department who think that they have an air-tight case, and Reacher's presence certainly wouldn't sit well with anyone trying to frame the accused. Indeed, anyone trying to frame the accused might go out of their way to make life literally difficult for Reacher, but making life difficult for Jack Reacher is usually more hazardous to the health of the bad guy than it is to Reacher.Just like the book that Jack Reacher was adapted from, actions and scenarios are extreme at times with some implausibilities, but the movie moves quickly and is well worth a rental for fans of the action/thriller/crime drama genres.",4,Cruisin' for a Bruisin',1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2304,"['Back', 'December', '2012', 'when', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'was', 'released', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'out', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'movie', 'actually', 'based', 'onOne', 'Shot', '2005', '9th', 'book', 'Lee', 'Child', 'series', 'One', 'Shot', 'was', 'excellent', 'book', 'pictured', 'Tom', 'Cruise-like', 'character', 'Reacher', 'knowing', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'watching', 'role.Cruise', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Reacher', 'movie', 'nailed', 'dialogue', 'However', 'Cruise', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'smaller', 'Reacher', 'guy', 'book', 'who', '6', '5', 'one', 'chapter', 'literally', 'guy', 'size', 'Stallone', 'bare', 'actually', 'noticed', 'made', 'Cruise', 'seem', 'as', 'tall', 'co-stars', 'several', 'scenes', 'made', 'CQC', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic.Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Reacher', 'rough', 'tough', 'character', 'military', 'police', 'background', 'Now', 'retired', 'most', 'part', 'drifter', 'Reacher', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'military', 'police', 'expert', 'expert', 'finding', 'trouble', 'fixing', 'However', 'now', 'independent', 'traditional', 'methods', 'used', 'police', 'Reacher', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'methods', 'Rambo', 'exact', 'justice.Jack', 'Reacher', 'guy', 'used', 'be', 'military', 'accused', 'atrocious', 'crime', 'Reacher', 'way', 'Pittsburgh', 'Indiana', 'book', 'investigate', 'out', 'guy', 'accused', 'atrocity', 'asked', 'cops', 'find', 'Reacher', 'one', 'only', 'statements', 'arrest', 'Reacher', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'guy', 'could', 'put', 'doubt', 'accusation', 'course', ""n't"", 'make', 'Reacher', 'friends', 'local', 'police', 'department', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'air-tight', 'case', 'Reacher', 'presence', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'anyone', 'trying', 'frame', 'accused', 'Indeed', 'anyone', 'trying', 'frame', 'accused', 'might', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'life', 'literally', 'difficult', 'Reacher', 'making', 'life', 'difficult', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'usually', 'more', 'hazardous', 'health', 'bad', 'guy', 'Reacher.Just', 'book', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'was', 'adapted', 'actions', 'scenarios', 'are', 'extreme', 'times', 'implausibilities', 'movie', 'quickly', 'well', 'rental', 'fans', 'action/thriller/crime', 'drama', 'genres']",N/A

Gorgeous area.There are a number of 'negative' reviews on here and i think most haven't even seen the movie (even though some ""claim"" they have just to negatively review it).

The reason he got the job is his incredible skills and adaptability.The much talked about ""car-chase"" scene is one of the best of the last 20 years. Why? 2 reasons. One, is its very realistic. Too many car chases i see in movies are so far-fetched ridiculous that they're actually boring. Two, the sound. This is without question the most realistic ""sounding"" car chase i've seen. The engine shifts and noises make you feel like you are right there, if not in the car itself.The twists and turns in the story and the eye-candy scenery from the Pittsburgh area make this film one that can be watched repeatedly - making a Blu-Ray purchase a no-brainer.

His lawyer (Rosamund Pike) happens to be the daughter of the prosecutor (Richard Jenkins). As Jack investigates, things are not what they seem which draws us into the story.Unfortunately the mystery is short lived as clues come too fast. It then resorts to an us vs. them with a car chase scene that lasted way to long for this type of crime drama. The script was otherwise well done. Acting was as we would expect from the cast.

1571447,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B008N6YTL4,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""Jack Reacher,"" based on Lee Child's popular seies of novels, stars Tom Cruise in the title role of a mysterious military investigator who looks into the murder of several civilians by a skilled sharpshooter. Reacher is a loner who solves crimes because he avoids falling into conventional thinking.  Having spent years as an Army cop, he now keeps a low profile, traveling under aliases and operating on instinct.  He knows the law often fails to provide justice, so he dedicates himself to getting that justice.Because Reacher has a photographic memory, it's tough for those he's pursuing to hide.  An occasional remark made days or even years ago remains fresh in his memory.In the novels, Reacher is 6' 4"", a far cry from Cruise's stature, but his Reacher does an effective job conveying a self-confident swagger and handling himself more than competently when danger encroaches.

1571457,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008N6YTL4,Todd Smith,"[3, 4]","Jack Reacher was nothing like I expected it to be. The previews made this film look like a comedy, featuring some bad ass cop that doesn't play by the rules. The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name.

1571473,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B008N6YTL4,Wanda B. Red,"[1, 1]","As a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan and a Tom Cruise carper, I did not expect to like this film. As many have noted, the sculpted, narcissistic, and frankly too-short Cruise was an unlikely choice to play Jack Reacher, who is almost a foot taller than Cruise and who studiously avoids the lime-light. But Cruise is surprisingly up to the part. His manner is dry and understated, quite Reacher-like, and he gives the other actors plenty of room. That's a good thing because Rosamund Pike is captivating as Helen Rodin, the defense attorney with whom Jack teams up. Her role is complicated in turn by the involvement of the undefeated DA, who is her father, thoughtfully played by Richard Jenkins. David Oyelowo is also compelling and weirdly touching as Emerson, the cop in charge of the case. Robert Duvall as Gunny Samuel Cash, is perfect as might be expectedI won't go into too much plot detail, so as not to spoil anything, but this film is deeply true to the novel on which it is based, Lee Child's best-selling ""One Shot."" (That may be because Child consulted on the film, which certainly didn't hurt, a fact that is itself a tribute to the writer/director Christopher McQuarrie.) Scene after scene feels like the book has simply come to life, and for a reader watching a film, such a feeling is rare. Where there are changes, they are the ones that are clearly demanded by the translation to the screen and also the locale. For example, the slow drawn-out tension of the final scene wouldn't work in a film where expectations are strong for a quick finish in the last 10-15 minutes. The site of the murders, minutely described in the novel, is slightly altered, probably to avoid building a commercial plaza and highway that existed only in Child's mind.This film has the lushness and glamor of a traditional noir novel. The decision to let Jack's romance with Helen linger in the twilight of desire, irony, and innuendo contributes to the effect. The script and directing are a model of restraint and intelligence (like many a Reacher novel).My only disappointment is in the truly unimaginative title. I can see why ""Jack Reacher"" might seem like the right choice, given the monitory role played by reference to the hero's name in the book (the accused requests Jack's presence by name before anyone else involved in the case knows who he is). But (especially in combination with the book's title ""One Shot"") the name of the film gives the impression that this will be the ONLY Reacher film. It's so good that I hope that is not the case.",4,Worth Jack,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,2541,"['Lee', 'Child/Jack', 'Reacher', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'carper', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', 'film', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'sculpted', 'narcissistic', 'frankly', 'too-short', 'Cruise', 'was', 'unlikely', 'choice', 'play', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'who', 'almost', 'foot', 'taller', 'Cruise', 'who', 'studiously', 'lime-light', 'Cruise', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'part', 'manner', 'dry', 'understated', 'quite', 'Reacher-like', 'other', 'actors', 'plenty', 'room', 'good', 'thing', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'captivating', 'Helen', 'Rodin', 'defense', 'attorney', 'whom', 'Jack', 'up', 'role', 'complicated', 'turn', 'involvement', 'undefeated', 'DA', 'who', 'father', 'thoughtfully', 'played', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'also', 'compelling', 'weirdly', 'touching', 'Emerson', 'cop', 'charge', 'case', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Gunny', 'Samuel', 'Cash', 'perfect', 'might', 'be', 'expectedI', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'detail', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'film', 'deeply', 'true', 'novel', 'based', 'Lee', 'Child', 'best-selling', 'One', 'Shot', 'may', 'be', 'Child', 'consulted', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fact', 'tribute', 'writer/director', 'Christopher', 'McQuarrie', 'Scene', 'scene', 'feels', 'book', 'simply', 'come', 'life', 'reader', 'watching', 'film', 'feeling', 'rare', 'Where', 'are', 'changes', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'clearly', 'demanded', 'translation', 'screen', 'also', 'locale', 'example', 'slow', 'drawn-out', 'tension', 'final', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'where', 'expectations', 'are', 'strong', 'quick', 'finish', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'site', 'murders', 'minutely', 'described', 'novel', 'slightly', 'altered', 'probably', 'avoid', 'building', 'commercial', 'plaza', 'highway', 'existed', 'only', 'Child', 'mind.This', 'film', 'lushness', 'glamor', 'traditional', 'noir', 'novel', 'decision', 'let', 'Jack', 'romance', 'Helen', 'linger', 'twilight', 'desire', 'irony', 'innuendo', 'contributes', 'effect', 'script', 'directing', 'are', 'model', 'restraint', 'intelligence', 'many', 'Reacher', 'novel', 'only', 'disappointment', 'truly', 'unimaginative', 'title', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'might', 'seem', 'right', 'choice', 'given', 'monitory', 'role', 'played', 'reference', 'hero', 'name', 'book', 'accused', 'requests', 'Jack', 'presence', 'name', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'case', 'who', 'especially', 'combination', 'book', 'title', 'One', 'Shot', 'name', 'film', 'impression', 'will', 'be', 'ONLY', 'Reacher', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'hope', 'not', 'case']",N/A
