877164,A2KB0ES96E85UZ,B00076ONT6,Amazon Customer,"[14, 15]","Xena can only be described as one of the most pivotal characters in television history - whether you loved or hated the show, she became a cultural phenomenon, the first true action hero that was a fully realized person with a sense of humor, flaws, and a sense of noble purpose.  The show built from a rather schlocky Hercules knock-off into a full-fledged original, and that's doing quite something.As always in this series, shows are character-driven much more than plot-driven.  So while there's an over-arching story and mythology, if a story seems to illuminate or use a character to good effect, the story is presented.  Best episodes this season were ""Who's Gurkhan?"", the (creepy) cannibal story, ""The Abyss"", the excellent ""Rheingold"" arc (sort of a loose 3-parter), the very amusing and quite unexpectedly touching ""Old Ares Had a Farm,"" the amazing ""When Fates Collide,"" and the lovely, light ""Many Happy Returns.""  These episodes contain a lot of really wonderful moments between characters, and some in surprising ways.  ""Old Ares"" is a funny look at country life with the girls as they help a de-powered Ares hide from angry villagers - it is very entertaining.  And ""Many Happy Returns"" is the last fun moment of the series - Xena tries to get tickets to take Gabrielle to a Sappho concert for her birthday, and mayhem ensues, of course.  This episode contains the reading of a beautiful, authentic poem actually written by Sappho (or at least attributed to her), and while there's a bunch of silly stuff in the episode, the emotions are quite real here, a preview of what is about to happen in the finale.""A Friend in Need.""  This one is very hard for me to even discuss.  Over the course of the six seasons the show ran, these characters sort of took on a life of their own for me.  I know they traveled all over the world, but having the series end in Jappa (Japan) was weird.  It was like the ending of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, in a way.  You know how it was about King Arthur and Camelot, and in the end, there are police cars and modern people all milling about with the knights.  Bizarre.  I would have much preferred to see this end in Greece, where it ostensibly began, so that it felt a little more like home.  I don't think I will be spoiling anything by saying that the death of Xena was painful to me; although I don't mind that she died, I would have liked to see Gabrielle go with her.  The need for her to remain dead rang a bit hollow to me, and I really didn't get that.  Still, the production values in this episode are gorgeous, and Xena is resplendent in her golden armor, although what it was shielding I'm not sure (the entire midriff and legs are bare - looks hot but not really very effective).Overall, this season is just loaded with some great tv, and it is highly recommended.  The finale, while shocking and sad, at least does provide a fitting end to the Warrior Princess.  Xena and Gabrielle broke barriers in every episode, and for that alone, the show should be highly commended.  How clairvoyant were those writers to say ""...her courage will change the world."" ?  Because the truth is, it did - Xena paved the way for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for Kill Bill, and for so many other great female lead roles.  At last, a strong woman who actually feels like a strong woman (and I include Gabrielle and the Amazons in this).  Too often, men writing women's roles seem to equate bitchy with strength, and it's just awful to listen to these shrill, emasculating bitches.  Once Xena came along, I think most writers collectively went, ""Ohhhhh... I get it now.""  So thank God for Xena!  Long may she live in syndication and on DVD!",5,"Great season - painful, jarring finale",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3682,"['Xena', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'one', 'most', 'pivotal', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'loved', 'hated', 'show', 'became', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'first', 'true', 'action', 'hero', 'was', 'fully', 'realized', 'person', 'sense', 'humor', 'flaws', 'sense', 'noble', 'purpose', 'show', 'built', 'rather', 'schlocky', 'Hercules', 'knock-off', 'full-fledged', 'original', 'doing', 'quite', 'something.As', 'always', 'series', 'shows', 'are', 'character-driven', 'much', 'more', 'plot-driven', 'So', 'over-arching', 'story', 'mythology', 'story', 'illuminate', 'use', 'character', 'good', 'effect', 'story', 'presented', 'Best', 'season', 'were', 'Who', 'Gurkhan', 'creepy', 'cannibal', 'story', 'Abyss', 'excellent', 'Rheingold', 'arc', 'sort', 'loose', '3-parter', 'very', 'amusing', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'touching', 'Old', 'Ares', 'Had', 'Farm', 'amazing', 'When', 'Fates', 'Collide', 'lovely', 'light', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'episodes', 'contain', 'lot', 'really', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'characters', 'surprising', 'ways', 'Old', 'Ares', 'funny', 'look', 'country', 'life', 'girls', 'help', 'de-powered', 'Ares', 'hide', 'angry', 'villagers', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'last', 'fun', 'moment', 'series', 'Xena', 'tries', 'get', 'tickets', 'take', 'Gabrielle', 'Sappho', 'concert', 'birthday', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'course', 'episode', 'reading', 'beautiful', 'authentic', 'poem', 'actually', 'written', 'Sappho', 'least', 'attributed', 'bunch', 'silly', 'stuff', 'episode', 'emotions', 'are', 'quite', 'real', 'here', 'preview', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'finale', 'Friend', 'Need', 'one', 'very', 'hard', 'even', 'discuss', 'course', 'six', 'seasons', 'show', 'ran', 'characters', 'sort', 'took', 'life', 'own', 'know', 'traveled', 'world', 'having', 'series', 'end', 'Jappa', 'Japan', 'was', 'weird', 'was', 'ending', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Camelot', 'end', 'are', 'police', 'cars', 'modern', 'people', 'milling', 'knights', 'Bizarre', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'see', 'end', 'Greece', 'where', 'ostensibly', 'began', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'saying', 'death', 'Xena', 'was', 'painful', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'died', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Gabrielle', 'go', 'need', 'remain', 'dead', 'rang', 'bit', 'hollow', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Still', 'production', 'values', 'episode', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Xena', 'resplendent', 'golden', 'armor', 'what', 'was', 'shielding', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'entire', 'midriff', 'legs', 'are', 'bare', 'hot', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'effective', '.Overall', 'season', 'just', 'loaded', 'great', 'tv', 'highly', 'recommended', 'finale', 'shocking', 'sad', 'least', 'provide', 'fitting', 'end', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'broke', 'barriers', 'episode', 'alone', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'highly', 'commended', 'How', 'clairvoyant', 'were', 'writers', 'say', 'courage', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'truth', 'did', 'Xena', 'paved', 'way', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'female', 'lead', 'roles', 'last', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'actually', 'strong', 'woman', 'include', 'Gabrielle', 'Amazons', 'Too', 'often', 'men', 'writing', 'women', 'roles', 'seem', 'equate', 'bitchy', 'strength', 'just', 'awful', 'listen', 'shrill', 'emasculating', 'bitches', 'Once', 'Xena', 'came', 'along', 'think', 'most', 'writers', 'collectively', 'went', 'get', 'now', 'thank', 'God', 'Xena', 'Long', 'may', 'live', 'syndication', 'DVD']",Xena Warrior Princess - Season Six

Erland,"[0, 0]","With the Olympian Gods out of the picture Xena turns her attention to the villains of the faith of Eli (i.e.: Jesus) and the angelic and demonic realms inhabiting the ever evolving heavenlies. Who could've guessed what a pivotal role the Warrior Princess was to play in the re-visioning of the new, reigning spiritual paradigm. How about starting out the sixth and last season of this highly entertaining though farfetched series with the ousting Mephistopheles from the throne of Hell?This is only the first of many outrageous steps taken by the Warrior Princess. Not willing to ascend (on second thought descend is probably the more accurate word) to the vacated throne herself, she lures the proud Lucifer into assuming the position. Whether you're a hardcore Xena fan or just a casual viewer sooner or later you have to ask yourself the question ""is there no limit to what the Warrior Princess can accomplish in this world or any other for that matter? The answer is apparently not.Yes, `Xena: Warrior Princess' is truly a television series for the ages. While her adventures and exploits may range from the absurd to the incomprehensible and the acting most of the time way over-the-top somehow believe it or not it was always tons of fun and the cast of characters where played to perfection by everyone involved.

While I would dearly love to get about half of season six on DVD, I morally feel like I can not spend my money to 'vote' for the things promoted in the other episodes.In previous seasons, they kind of played the whole 'are Xena and Gabrielle lovers instead of just best friends?' thing, but it was generally subtle enough I could just roll my eyes at the supposed subtext.  In this season, we not only have Xena and Gabrielle blatantly sexually attracted to each other at times, but they had Aphrodite try to give Gabrielle a kiss.  The finale clearly had a kiss between Xena and Gabrielle.  It left me feeling like someone had hijacked my friends of old for a few cheap thrills.(Just so you know, Xena's frequent sexual encounters with men she's not married to also bother me.)However, the main reason I can't spend my money on this season set is because they treat Christianity like some mythos no one really believes, like it's totally okay to change and warp to fit whatever they want in the scene.  They were sensitive to 'The Way' controversy, but had no compunction against degrading and warping the message of a major religion repeatedly...and the sad part is very few Christians complained.  To have Xena trick a good (though proud) angel into becoming the devil, then to have a good angel portrayed in such a negative fashion...to have the Christian God just one of many gods and set on destroying all the other ones...to have a few of the old Gods (and the devil) as needed for a balanced universe (i.e. God isn't powerful enough and evil is necessary, not a perversion of good)...to have Christianity played as a cult only idiots would follow...  Well, it was insulting and offensive to me.  So I'm using my consumer's right to not spend money on it and my freedom of speech to tell other Christians that they might want to think twice about buying this set.",2,The best and the worst episodes...,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2021,"['Undoubtedly', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'upset', 'review', 'want', 'warn', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'season', 'six', 'content', 'would', 'dearly', 'love', 'get', 'half', 'season', 'six', 'DVD', 'morally', 'feel', 'can', 'not', 'spend', 'money', ""'vote"", 'things', 'promoted', 'other', 'episodes.In', 'previous', 'seasons', 'kind', 'played', 'whole', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'lovers', 'instead', 'just', 'best', 'friends', 'thing', 'was', 'generally', 'subtle', 'enough', 'could', 'just', 'roll', 'eyes', 'supposed', 'subtext', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'blatantly', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'other', 'times', 'had', 'Aphrodite', 'try', 'give', 'Gabrielle', 'kiss', 'finale', 'clearly', 'had', 'kiss', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'left', 'feeling', 'someone', 'had', 'hijacked', 'friends', 'old', 'few', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'Just', 'so', 'know', 'Xena', 'frequent', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'men', 'not', 'married', 'also', 'bother', 'However', 'main', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'season', 'set', 'treat', 'Christianity', 'mythos', 'one', 'really', 'totally', 'okay', 'change', 'warp', 'fit', 'want', 'scene', 'were', 'sensitive', ""'The"", 'Way', 'controversy', 'had', 'compunction', 'degrading', 'warping', 'message', 'major', 'religion', 'repeatedly', 'sad', 'part', 'very', 'few', 'Christians', 'complained', 'have', 'Xena', 'trick', 'good', 'proud', 'angel', 'becoming', 'devil', 'then', 'have', 'good', 'angel', 'portrayed', 'such', 'negative', 'fashion', 'have', 'Christian', 'God', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'gods', 'set', 'destroying', 'other', 'ones', 'have', 'few', 'old', 'Gods', 'devil', 'needed', 'balanced', 'universe', 'i.e', 'God', ""n't"", 'powerful', 'enough', 'evil', 'necessary', 'not', 'perversion', 'good', 'have', 'Christianity', 'played', 'cult', 'only', 'idiots', 'would', 'follow', 'Well', 'was', 'insulting', 'offensive', ""'m"", 'using', 'consumer', 'right', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'freedom', 'speech', 'tell', 'other', 'Christians', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'buying', 'set']",Xena Warrior Princess - Season Six

I love this feature simply because it was very informative and even funny, at times.  It is very interesting to see the actors talk about their roles and the storylines. Also, the various producers and directors comments give excellent and insightful background on what were the intentions behind an episode, the complexities and challenges involved in getting it done, and their perception on whether or not the attempted vision was successful or not.This excellent DVD box set even includes never before seen footage of deleted and alternate scenes! These features are also the most enjoyable and most watched for any fans of a show.  They present several perspectives of how the story could have developed and they intrigue the viewers.

With that, I own all 6 box sets & this season, hands down, is my FAVORITE for more reasons that I can express. The chemistry between Xena (Lucy Lawless) & Gabrielle (the brilliant Renee O'Connor) was always unsurpassed but they both just ILLUMINATED every adventure, every script, and every moment of this season like it was nothing. The acting was immeasurable and flawless, the plots were salted with idealism, stories of retribution and forgiveness, everlasting love, inexplicable sacrifice and unrelenting bravery, the profound depths of one's being exposed...EVERYTHING was touched upon this season. The special effects were top notch, the sets were lush and rich, the guest stars were excellent, the dialogue consisting of nothing but the best & their devotion to one another the strongest it ever was.6th SEASON FAVES INCLUDE:Who's Gurkhan?When Gabrielle learns that her niece has been captured by the vicious raider Gurkhan, she sets sail for North Africa on a rescue mission with Xena, Eve, and Virgil.LegacyXena and Gabrielle intervene to help two tribes unite against their Roman enemies in the North African desert.The AbyssXena and Gabrielle are forced into a deadly confrontation with cannibals when they go in search of Virgil. Contains the famous cave scene where Xena embraces the very hypothermic GabThe RheingoldXena embarks on a deadly mission involving her dark past when the Norse warrior Beowulf approaches her for help.The RingXena must battle a monster of her own making to recover the destructive Rheingold ring she forged in her evil Xena days.Return of the ValkyrieXena battles to regain her memory and reverse the curse of the Rheingold ring.You Are ThereIn an ancient world meets modern-day satire, a tabloid TV reporter stalks Xena and Gabrielle, determined to get a juicy scoop on the Warrior Princess.When Fates Collide- BEST EPISODE EVERXena finds herself empress of Rome when Caesar chains the three Fates and cuts the strands of time. Mad surprises await....To Helicon and BackWhen the Amazon Queen Varia is kidnapped by a masked warrior, Gabrielle leads the Amazons to Helicon on a bloody rescue mission.Many Happy ReturnsOn Gab's birthday, the two prevent a group of religious fanatics from sacrificing a virgin and teach her the ways of the world along with Aphrodite. Features the BEAUTIFUL Sappho poem written for Gabrielle.Soul PossessionWhen an ancient scroll chronicling the life of Xena surfaces in the present, conflicts arise among the reincarnations of Xena, Gabrielle, Ares and Joxer.

I though Hercules with Kevin Sorbo would be but Xena was a LOT more tough, gritty, and VI-O-LLLLENT. One woman you do NOT want to get angry with you, EVER. Xena was the ultimate warrior in this series and often hinted at being related possibly to some deity biologically but which one was never revealed. She was an Amazon(that sounds like a familiar name), Valkyrie, and warlord rolled into one BAAAAAAAAD girl. Superhuman fighting skills and powers. A lot of characters from Hercules also appeared on Xena. The war with Dahak was literally Biblical and EPIC with Michael the Archangel and the Four Horsemen(not Ric Flair's version in past NWA wrestling days) helping to fight Dahak, a ""Satan"" like being bent on Earth's destruction. Action, action, action, action is Xena personified. If you like Beastmaster, Conan, Hercules, Legend(my all-time favorite with Beastmaster a tie), you will LOVE Xena. One other thing too although not quite as professional. The women on this series are GORGEOUS, especially Aphrodite. Why this woman is not seen more on TV is a low down, dirty, rotten shame. Easily the sexiest woman on TV in the last two decades. A good choice for the ""goddess of love"". Xena is a must-have for action/adventure/fantasy/martial arts fans of all ages.

877186,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B00076ONT6,P. Hardy,"[18, 29]","Xena has always been my favorite television series (among many others) when it was on. Though I had my disappointments with Season Five, the season finale ""Motherhood"" was a nice compensation for the let downs in that. Season six, however gave me more disappointments in what they tried to do with Xena and Gabrielle's obvious ""platonic"" relationship by riddling season six with ""crowd pleaser"" episodes for the large Lesbian cult following Xena had gathered since season two's ""Here She Comes Miss Amphipolis."" That aside, I thought season six was a pretty good way to end the long running series: The Story Arcs concerning more of Xena's past were completed with much explanation behind them.The Comedic episodes were actually funny this time around, especially ""Many Happy Returns,"" -- that a was a side splitter majorly. The drama of Season six delivered in ways other TV series usually fail at with overbearing drama that you ultimately cannot stomach any more than a few minutes. Xena's drama was balanced out by the comedic episodes, the overall writing of each episode and the delivery of the actors in each scene. Many characters from previous seasons such as Alti, Joxer, The God of War, Ares (the late Kevin Tod Smith), and The Goddess of Love Aphrodite, all make their final appearances as the episodes near the finale. Gabrielle takes more an initiative, but not so much like she did in season five, behaving more like a warrior in the sense of the word while still retaining most the innocence and quirkiness Gabrielle had at the beginning series. Xena is a lot more kinder, as opposed to her character in the last five seasons. Although it can never be denied that the actor and actresses looked pretty bored playing their roles in the series (even Claire Standsfield - who hadn't been seen in Xena since ""Them Bone, Them Bones,"" looked bored in her role as the witch doctor type character. Xena and Gabrielle's chemistry in the more serious episodes seemed forced in a way to make you believe that they were at odds on a subject, especially in the Amazon oriented episodes. Kevin Smith managed to hide whatever scrap of boredom he had with his character and pulled of convincingly as always.The DVD extras are plentiful, including bloopers which turned out not to be funny at all unless your merit a short lived giggled and frown afterward. I expected laugh my head off. The Cast interviews coulda been better executed in ways of editing and actor atmosphere: Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor looked completely beside themselves in boredom and uncomfortable silences broken my forced laughs in the cast interview for ""Many Happy Returns."" There are also season one promotional and a behind the scenes look at the ""A Friend In Need."" There are TEN DISC inside this box sets, which are also almost impossible to get out without the fear of snapping the DVD in two lingering in the back of your head.

877187,A1YVSRX09MZABR,B00076ONT6,S. Donovan,"[0, 0]","Xena is my favorite TV show of all time. I watched it back in the 90's when it aired, but after seeing the final episode (FIN) my heart was broken. I had to put it behind me. Even though I told myself it was just a TV show, the horror of the last episode haunts me to this day.Back then, I didn't know the Xenaverse existed! Recently, I decided I'd go back and watch X:WP again. I hadn't  realized how much I love this show, or how much my heart aches missing these two characters. There is no other show that comes close to the brilliance, the genius, the inspiration, or the chemistry that exists between the two lead characters (brilliantly acted by Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor).X:WP is great for so many reasons, not the least of which it is so empowering for young girls and women. Even today, I read stories by adult women who relate that Xena changed their lives, is still changing their lives, whether it is because they are facing a major illness like cancer or supporting a friend through a difficult time like a divorce.I wonder if anyone truly understands the ripple effect of Xena: WP! If you want a good idea, just check out all of the bards who found their voices and are published authors today. Many of them found their muse through Gabrielle on Xena. Honestly, I seriously doubt that anyone has truly understood the cultural phenomenon that Xena is. It was a major inspiration for the LGBT community who found an icon in these characters. I will always be grateful to Lucy, Renee, Rob Tapert, Liz Friedman and the rest of the Xena movers and shakers who embraced us, the fans, and encouraged us to love Xena in our own way. She will live on forever in our hearts.What do you get when you buy the series? An amazing story that will tug at your heart strings and never let them go.

The colors are good, (People are saying there bad) Maybe it's the tv, because the colors are great.  There has been some audio troubles with my dvd set, such has the voices start to get fuzzy when they talk loud.  I've seen more than half the season and it's a great season.  If your fan of Xena you shouldn't have to wonder about getting this or not.  All the epsiodes are good, besides ""You are there""  I think there running out of ideas for episodes.  I haven't had the time to explore the bonus materials, but will get to it.  This season is no different than Season's one through five.  If were lucky we will get a movie.  We need a movie desperatley.  Let's keep going at it, and it will happen.  Buy this DVD set to finish of the series.  It's no different.  Believe me.
