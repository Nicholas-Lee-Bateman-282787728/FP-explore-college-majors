It said King Arthur in the title, so me being a fan of Arthurian legend, and having apparently missed this movie from '95.  I had some problems with it.So the ""kid"" in question is playing baseball.  Apparently he is not very good at it (ie: strikes out a lot).  After he strikes out to his arch-baseball-rival-pitcher-guy, a big gigantic earthquake came and sucked him into a big whole which apparently is some sort of inside-earth-time-wormhole, or something.  They don't really explain that, well it's a kids movie, so I will give them that one for free.  Anyways, he gets spat out in the medieaval ages in ""Camelot.""  A few items about King Arthur and his family, Arthur never reached old age, in this movie he appeared as a grandfather figure.  And he also didn't have two daughters (he had one son, Mordred) as in this movie.Well, most of the movie is spent with the people from that era usually the nobility and knights and Arthur's one daughter who is the kid's age, oggling at his backpack (which he lukily brought with him) of futuristic ""wonders"" and they have a jolly good time.  But he wants to get back home.  Where's Merlin, oh, he's a willy old face in a well.  Yep.  So he gets about a days worth of knight training from a non-realistic generous knight and suddenly he's a master fighter and jouster as seen later in the film.Anyways, the movie ends with him getting back and his new love (Arthur's daughter) and Arthur being in the real world with him (yeah, like Arthur would leave his kingdom for some kid) and he's sent back before the infamous strike out.  Blah blah blah.All in all, kids may be impressed and like this movie.  I didn't find it too entertaining.  If you want a movie about a ""future guy"" in the past, a Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was way better.  This didn't do it for me and may not for a lot of other people.",2,A Kid not in King Arthur's Court,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,1969,"['saw', 'movie', 'flipping', 'tv', 'stations', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'actually', 'was', 'early', 'morning', 'said', 'King', 'Arthur', 'title', 'being', 'fan', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'having', 'apparently', 'missed', 'movie', ""'95"", 'had', 'problems', 'kid', 'question', 'playing', 'baseball', 'Apparently', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'ie', 'strikes', 'out', 'lot', 'out', 'arch-baseball-rival-pitcher-guy', 'big', 'gigantic', 'earthquake', 'came', 'sucked', 'big', 'whole', 'apparently', 'sort', 'inside-earth-time-wormhole', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'well', 'kids', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'free', 'Anyways', 'spat', 'out', 'medieaval', 'Camelot', 'few', 'items', 'King', 'Arthur', 'family', 'Arthur', 'never', 'reached', 'old', 'age', 'movie', 'appeared', 'grandfather', 'figure', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'daughters', 'had', 'one', 'son', 'Mordred', 'movie.Well', 'most', 'movie', 'spent', 'people', 'era', 'usually', 'nobility', 'knights', 'Arthur', 'one', 'daughter', 'who', 'kid', 'age', 'oggling', 'backpack', 'lukily', 'brought', 'futuristic', 'wonders', 'have', 'jolly', 'good', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'Where', 'Merlin', 'oh', 'willy', 'old', 'face', 'well', 'Yep', 'So', 'days', 'knight', 'training', 'non-realistic', 'generous', 'knight', 'suddenly', 'master', 'fighter', 'jouster', 'seen', 'later', 'film.Anyways', 'movie', 'getting', 'back', 'new', 'love', 'Arthur', 'daughter', 'Arthur', 'being', 'real', 'world', 'yeah', 'Arthur', 'would', 'leave', 'kingdom', 'kid', 'sent', 'back', 'infamous', 'strike', 'out', 'Blah', 'blah', 'blah.All', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'impressed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'entertaining', 'want', 'movie', 'future', 'guy', 'past', 'Conneticut', 'Yankee', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Court', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'may', 'not', 'lot', 'other', 'people']",A Kid In King Arthur's Court VHS

389451,ALMWVT16TUZWE,6303925243,Haley Anne,"[15, 15]","No matter how many times I watch this movie, or the older I get, I am still in love with it! Being a fan of the time of King Arthur, and time  travel without the use of science fiction novel tactics, this movie was a  thrill for me to watch!The lead character, Calvin, is a less than  popular guy back in his home town of Receda, California. When he is  suddenly thrown through time with the help of Merlin, he finds himself in a  completely different world. Although the plot doesn't exactly follow any of  the stories of King Arthur (i.e. King Aurthur and Guinevere never had any  kids, obviously. She ran away w/ Lancelot) but it has the romantic appeal  of the time period, and Calvin's friendships with the king and his youngest  daughter, Princess Catherine are wonderful! As it goes on, his character  flaws are sraightened out and he becomes a stronger person, faced with many  tasks most persons never endure. The final scene's tie it all together  until he finally goes home, and realizes he can be the person he aspires  to.The film is absolutely wonderful with the adventure, romance, and  humor tying togther to make a memorable occassion.

The worse part is, he didn't even try but just stood there as he struck out.  Just as he's returning to the dug out, an earthquake hits, and Calvin is swallowed by the giant hole that opens in the ground.To his surprise, Calvin lands in 6th century England.  Because his appearance foiled the Black Knight, Calvin is hailed as a hero by the aging King Arthur (Joss Ackland).However, all is not rosy in Camelot.  Lord Belasco (Art Malik) has turned the people against Arthur and plans to get his hands on the crown by whatever means he can.  In fact, this is the very reason that Merlin (Ron Moody) has summoned Calvin.  But Calvin is a kid who can't even muster the courage to swing a bat.  Can he find the courage to defeat the evil Belasco?I first saw this movie when it was in the theater and loved it.  I hadn't seen it since but rewatched it recently.  It lost some of its charm in those years, but it was still plenty fun.  Based loosely on a Mark Twain classic, it keeps the action moving forward.  There were lots of laughs as Calvin tried to explain himself in the historical setting.  The movie is predictable, but that doesn't really dampen any of the fun.  Some of the scenes of special effects haven't aged well, but all the actors take it seriously enough to make that a minor point.This will easily entertain kids.

389457,A1LDIMQISH07WK,6303925243,Rebecca,"[10, 12]","Thomas Ian Nicholas is awesome in A KID IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT. He's very talented, and so is the rest of this cast. This movie is basically about a kid who lives in a town called Roceda, in California (I think). Anyway, during a Little League baseball game, Calvin (which is the kid's name) goes up to bat - and shaking all over in fear, of course - and almost instantly strikes out. While heading back to the bench, an earthquake starts to rumble, and everybody races out of the bench...except for Calvin. Instead, Calvin is magically transported back in the time of King Arthur! Once he gets there, Calvin meets Merlin, who sent him there by accident (thinking that Calvin was a knight because his baseball team was called the Knights). But when Calvin explains that he's not a real knight, Merlin tells him that Calvin &quot;will do&quot; and Calvin now must save the Kingdom of Camelot from the evil Lord Belasco who wants to try and take over the kingdom by trying to marry Princess Sarah (Kate Winslet), King Arthur's oldest daughter! Also, while helping King Arthur, Calvin of course, falls in love with King Arthur's youngest daughter, Princess Katie. (And before Calvin got transported back to the Middle Ages, he of course manages to retrieve his backpack full of modern-day items such as a CD Walkman and rollerblades, which he uses to impress the people of the Middle Ages.) This is a great film for all ages and kids find it quite entertaining (in fact, so did I - and I'm 17 years old!). It's really exciteding and fun to see Kate Winslet and Thomas Ian Nicholas playing roles in their earlier years of filming...and this movie is really funny, too.P.S.: If you love Thomas Ian Nicholas, then check out these other great Thomas Ian Nicholas Flicks: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, A KID IN ALADDIN'S PALACE, and AMERICAN PIE.
