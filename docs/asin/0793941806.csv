Julia OrmondWhy is this stunningly beautiful and talented actress so underused?  Her imdb.com filmography is scandalously short, given her obvious talents.  She's brilliant here as lead character Smilla Jeperson - complex, alluring, conflicted and committed.  For Ormond alone, check out this movie.But, wow, are there some peculiarities here.  Let's start off with a group of American and English characters roaming about Copenhagen, ostensibly Danish (one would think), all speaking English in shifting accents.  Reminds me of the recent John Malkovich-helmed ""Dancer Upstairs"" - set in quasi-Peru, all in English with Spanish accents.  Just weird.  Weird here, too.Then there's the progression of the movie.  Its first half is this pretty tight, intense *little* thriller.  Then, in the second half, it's off to Greenland by freighter, Ormond turns into a Bond girl, bodies start dropping, throbbing meteorites somehow figure greatly, huge explosions go off.  I mean, what happened?The odd casting is also worthy of comment.  Robert Loggia as Julia Ormond's father?  Ummmm....No.  And although Peter Hoeg probably lays this out in excruciating detail in his 500 (or so) page book, the moviegoer never gets any explanation of how/why the Loggia character was in Greenland, how he met and wooed Ormond's Inuit Mom, why he's in Copenhagen now, etc., etc.Despite all these oddities, 'Smilla' is worth a rental or purchase.",3,What a weird one:  like two different movies,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1537,"['First', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'what', 'good', 'Smilla', 'can', 'list', 'easily:1', 'Julia', 'Ormond2', 'Julia', 'Ormond3', 'Julia', 'OrmondWhy', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actress', 'so', 'underused', 'imdb.com', 'filmography', 'scandalously', 'short', 'given', 'obvious', 'talents', 'brilliant', 'here', 'lead', 'character', 'Smilla', 'Jeperson', 'complex', 'alluring', 'conflicted', 'committed', 'Ormond', 'alone', 'check', 'out', 'movie.But', 'wow', 'are', 'there', 'peculiarities', 'here', 'Let', 'start', 'off', 'group', 'American', 'English', 'characters', 'roaming', 'Copenhagen', 'ostensibly', 'Danish', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'speaking', 'English', 'shifting', 'accents', 'Reminds', 'recent', 'John', 'Malkovich-helmed', 'Dancer', 'Upstairs', 'set', 'quasi-Peru', 'English', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'Just', 'weird', 'Weird', 'here', 'too.Then', 'progression', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'tight', 'intense', '*little*', 'thriller', 'Then', 'second', 'half', 'Greenland', 'freighter', 'Ormond', 'Bond', 'girl', 'bodies', 'start', 'dropping', 'throbbing', 'meteorites', 'somehow', 'figure', 'greatly', 'huge', 'explosions', 'go', 'mean', 'what', 'happened', 'odd', 'casting', 'also', 'worthy', 'comment', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'father', 'Ummmm', '.No', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'probably', 'out', 'excruciating', 'detail', '500', 'so', 'page', 'book', 'moviegoer', 'never', 'explanation', 'how/why', 'Loggia', 'character', 'was', 'Greenland', 'how', 'met', 'wooed', 'Ormond', 'Inuit', 'Mom', 'why', 'Copenhagen', 'now', 'etc.', 'etc.Despite', 'oddities', ""'Smilla"", 'rental', 'purchase']",N/A

Smilla, a woman who befriended the boy, knows that something is wrong, very wrong, and she won't rest until she learns the truth.'Smilla's Sense of Snow' is a very intelligent mystery for the most part.  The last 30 minutes aren't nearly as satisfying as the first 90, but the film still has a lot going for it:  Ormond does a great job as Smilla, a loner who refuses to let anyone near her.  The entire cast is very good.  The plot is mostly tightly written, until the last several minutes as mentioned before.  The real star of the show, however, is the location.  It is very refreshing to see a film that takes place not in America, but in Denmark and in Greenland.  One of the reasons, I believe, we go to the movies is to experience a place we've never been to before.  I liked the fact that the film was set in Copenhagen and later in Greenland.

159720,AAV7I6CYFZ2DB,0793941806,Barry Eysman,"[3, 3]","Though Peter Hoeg's novel is excellent,  reading it was more like seeing the film of thebook. With the movie, I felt I was reading the novel it was based on. Hoeg's novel is ofmuch worth, and without it there would have been no film; many of the finest moments ofthe film come from it, yet, the movie was so additionally contemplative, expansive of thehuman qualities of the novel, so filled with characters, emotions and events, dark andlovely, so utterly otherworldly, that it pulled me totally in as the book didn't. The film'sprologue starts over one hundred years ago, with a cauldron of nightmare screaming downfrom frosty skies to crash into frozen ice Greenland. It is a perfect opening, for it sayslisten and watch; you have never been here before. The rest of the film constantly proves itright.Julia Ormond is so superb as Smilla, she made me tremble. How could one not love her,who does not trust love, this woman of dignity and intelligence, who champions a hurtlonely child, and all losers and misfits, because she is as they? The film is a celebration oflogic and endless winter. Smilla's mathematical definition of longing is inspiring. I seemagnificence in math now, when never before. The movie could not work anywhere elsebut in ice and snow. It is a major character. There are passages in the book that take placein hot summer. They seem wrong.It is a delving into something that is so gigantic that one feels the sky is going to be pulledback and we shall see what is behind existence itself. But it never forgets the little six yearold boy who dies, and the people who surrounded him, hurt him, helped him. To Smilla,regardless of how far from home, that is not her home, she travels, to her former home,that is no longer hers, this is the flame in her mind, finding the murderer, because whensomeone is killed, their soul is offended, and she wants the child  to rest in peace.  If thereis one overriding trait in Smilla, it is an intense loyalty.  When the mystery is revealed, herheart still holds the memory of this child above all else, for he remains the essence. Howcould he not?It is a dark world exploration of snow and secrets and a totally unblinking view of realreality, and how such an injustice to a boy who never got to really live towers above theunveiling of what nightmare fell from the sky so long ago, and killed a child in the 1990's.It is of perfect, mathematical symmetry. Snow, ice, expansive wilderness,  icebergs  andtundra  blend with the warmth of humans beginning to heal, the humans needing all of theseeming contradictions. It also is about a daughter (Ormond) and father (superbly playedby Robert Loggia) finally beginning to make peace with each other. The film is a tapestryof the compact some humans make with other humans, so small against such vast lonelybreathtaking vistas, in order to survive . At the top of the world, there is freedom that isdizzying and ultimately liberating.",5,"This Silent, This Secret Snow",1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2941,"['Peter', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'excellent', 'reading', 'was', 'more', 'seeing', 'film', 'thebook', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'reading', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'ofmuch', 'worth', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'many', 'finest', 'moments', 'ofthe', 'film', 'come', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'additionally', 'contemplative', 'expansive', 'thehuman', 'qualities', 'novel', 'so', 'filled', 'characters', 'emotions', 'events', 'dark', 'andlovely', 'so', 'utterly', 'otherworldly', 'pulled', 'totally', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", ""film'sprologue"", 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'cauldron', 'nightmare', 'screaming', 'downfrom', 'frosty', 'skies', 'crash', 'frozen', 'ice', 'Greenland', 'perfect', 'opening', 'sayslisten', 'watch', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'rest', 'film', 'constantly', 'itright.Julia', 'Ormond', 'so', 'superb', 'Smilla', 'made', 'tremble', 'How', 'could', 'one', 'not', 'love', 'who', 'not', 'trust', 'love', 'woman', 'dignity', 'intelligence', 'who', 'hurtlonely', 'child', 'losers', 'misfits', 'film', 'celebration', 'oflogic', 'endless', 'winter', 'Smilla', 'mathematical', 'definition', 'longing', 'inspiring', 'seemagnificence', 'math', 'now', 'when', 'never', 'before', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'work', 'anywhere', 'elsebut', 'ice', 'snow', 'major', 'character', 'are', 'passages', 'book', 'take', 'placein', 'hot', 'summer', 'seem', 'wrong.It', 'delving', 'something', 'so', 'gigantic', 'one', 'sky', 'going', 'be', 'pulledback', 'shall', 'see', 'what', 'behind', 'existence', 'never', 'little', 'six', 'yearold', 'boy', 'who', 'people', 'who', 'surrounded', 'hurt', 'helped', 'Smilla', 'regardless', 'how', 'far', 'home', 'not', 'home', 'former', 'home', 'longer', 'hers', 'flame', 'mind', 'finding', 'murderer', 'whensomeone', 'killed', 'soul', 'offended', 'child', 'rest', 'peace', 'thereis', 'one', 'overriding', 'trait', 'Smilla', 'intense', 'loyalty', 'When', 'mystery', 'revealed', 'herheart', 'still', 'memory', 'child', 'else', 'essence', 'not', 'dark', 'world', 'exploration', 'snow', 'secrets', 'totally', 'unblinking', 'view', 'realreality', 'how', 'such', 'injustice', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'really', 'live', 'towers', 'theunveiling', 'what', 'nightmare', 'fell', 'sky', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'killed', 'child', ""1990's.It"", 'perfect', 'mathematical', 'symmetry', 'Snow', 'ice', 'expansive', 'wilderness', 'icebergs', 'andtundra', 'blend', 'warmth', 'humans', 'beginning', 'heal', 'humans', 'needing', 'theseeming', 'contradictions', 'also', 'daughter', 'Ormond', 'father', 'superbly', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'finally', 'beginning', 'make', 'peace', 'other', 'film', 'tapestryof', 'compact', 'humans', 'make', 'other', 'humans', 'so', 'small', 'such', 'vast', 'lonelybreathtaking', 'vistas', 'order', 'survive', 'top', 'world', 'freedom', 'isdizzying', 'ultimately', 'liberating']",N/A

159728,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0793941806,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 5]","Even though the story falls off a little towards the end, I like this movie a lot. It has a cold, strange setting in Greenland and Copenhagen, a strong, fierce, independent heroine in Smilla Jasperson, a well-played second lead in Gabriel Byrne, and a story that, I think, is engrossing.Smilla is woman who keeps to herself, trusts no one, and knows everything there is to know about the properties of snow. She's the daughter of an Inuit Greenlander and a Danish father. Her mother is dead; she's not close to her father; she's alienated from comfortable Danish society, but probably could never do well in Inuit Greenland. One day she comes home to her apartment in Copenhagen and finds that a young Inuit boy who lived in the building had fallen to his death. The police tell her that he had been playing on the roof and had accidently fallen. Smilla is instantly suspicious because she knew the eight-year-old was frightened of heights. Later, her reading of his prints in the snow convince her that he was running from something. Then she learns that there were puncture marks on his body. This sets up the story that involves an obsessive and ruthless scientist, a powerful company, a coverup and a huge scientific secret in Greenland.One thing really makes this movie work for me, and that is Ormond's performance as Smilla. Ormond is a beautiful woman, but she's also a good actress. She nails the part as a person with many grievances and no particular reason to get close to anyone. She seldom smiles. Yet she does get close to the boy. Their gradual warming relationship, shown in flashback, is realistic and touching. Her relationship to the character played by Byrne is also intriguing. He lives in the same apartment house and for some time it's unclear what his role is. While Byrne's character is deeper than we think, in a test of wills Smilla is just as strong or stronger than he is. It's a nice concept.The movie also features one of the most gripping opening sequences I've seen. In a vast, sunlit, silent ice field a single Inuit hunter holding a spear is standing motionless by an air hole waiting for a seal. His dogs are nearby. You see a streak of light descend in the far distance, hear a rumble, the dogs get restless. The hunter sees far away a great wave of snow and debris. He harnesses the dogs and takes off, trying to out race the gradually nearing line of disturbance that's moving toward him. The race is desperate and he doesn't make it.But then there's the ending to deal with. It's not really a bad ending. It involves Smilla stowing away on a ship headed to Greenland, and then learning a sort of science fiction answer to the mystery. For me, it's always a bit of a letdown because the first three-quarters of the movie are so good. It doesn't keep me from watching the movie every year or so.The other roles are played by very good actors, including Richard Harris, Tom Wilkinson, Bob Peck, Vanessa Redgrave and Jim Broadbent.The DVD transfer is very good.

159729,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0793941806,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","The title has to do with how Smilla Jasperson has a knowing sense about snow the same way some people have a sense about God, as she tells former Greenland Mining accountant Elsa Lubing when investigating the death of Isaiah, a six-year Greenlander boy Smilla played with and cared about.  According to Copenhagen police report, Isaiah fell to his death from the roof of the apartment building she lives in.  Smilla, examining the boy's footprints, is convinced that it was murder, not an accident, and investigates.She's not very sociable otherwise.  In flashbacks, she initially refuses to let Isaiah in to read to him, and even bluntly tells him he stinks.  The next scene has her giving him a bath.  Isaiah's mother Juliane is very neglecting of her offspring, often drunk and having parties.  Smilla spent time reading stories to Isaiah, and the latter feels a connection because Smilla is part-Greenlander on her late mother's side.She is automatically suspicious and hostile to a neighbour of hers, a man billed as the Mechanic, who is attracted to her.  At one time, he asks her why her tongue is so rough.  She shoots back with &quot;I try to be rough all over&quot; before leaving.  The Mechanic also claims to have cared for Isaiah, and wants to help her, but she is reluctant.  It doesn't help matters that she has a checkered past, and the police try to use that, and exploiting her claustrophobia to get her to mind her own business.  As she spent her childhood in Greenland, being used to the wide open spaces, her personal hell is being locked up in tiny spaces.Her moment of philosophy comes when she tells the Mechanic why mathematics is like human life.  The positive integers are the numbers of a child, but longing comes when his/her consciousness expands and fills with longing.  Negative numbers thus become the equation for longing-&quot;the formalization of the feeling that you're missing something.&quot;  And fractions represent the spaces in between stones, people, etc.  Math is thus a large landscape, much like Greenland, where the horizons never end and always recede.Even her father, a doctor, is difficult to connect with, because he is now married to Benja, an annoying blonde who goes out of her way to irritate her.  At lunch, when Smilla asks her father of a suspicious result on Isaiah's autopsy, Benja loudly says she's put off her food.  However, her father is patient enough with her and firm enough with Benja to provide a balance, precarious as it is.Clues lead Smilla to Greenland Mining, where Isaiah's father worked and died in an accident a few years ago, and Andreas Tork, the head of GM.  She also puts a Dr. Loyen, the doctor responsible for the autopsy as another suspect.  There is clearly a conspiracy or coverup going on.  Things go into espionage mode towards the end, and that's where things lose credibility.As the mostly unsmiling anti-hero Smilla, Julia Ormond gives a full portrayal of someone unapproachable, headstrong, rough with people, regardless of feelings, but someone who wants justice and the soul of her young friend to be at peace.  So different from her title character portrayal of the remake of Sabrina.  Robert Loggia is the only other laudable character as her father, Moritz.  Gabriel Byrne turns in a so-so performance as the mysterious Mechanic.  The cold grayness of Copenhagen and the vast snowscape of Greenland add to the forbidding atmosphere of the film, but the unevenness between the slow-drawn investigation to James Bond-like espionage leaves much to be desired.",3,"Ormond is the best thing in uneven, but satisfying drama",1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,3554,"['title', 'do', 'how', 'Smilla', 'Jasperson', 'knowing', 'sense', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'have', 'sense', 'God', 'former', 'Greenland', 'Mining', 'accountant', 'Elsa', 'Lubing', 'when', 'investigating', 'death', 'Isaiah', 'six-year', 'Greenlander', 'boy', 'Smilla', 'played', 'cared', 'about', 'According', 'Copenhagen', 'police', 'report', 'Isaiah', 'fell', 'death', 'roof', 'apartment', 'building', 'Smilla', 'examining', 'boy', 'footprints', 'convinced', 'was', 'murder', 'not', 'accident', 'investigates.She', 'not', 'very', 'sociable', 'otherwise', 'flashbacks', 'initially', 'let', 'Isaiah', 'read', 'even', 'bluntly', 'next', 'scene', 'giving', 'bath', 'Isaiah', 'mother', 'Juliane', 'very', 'neglecting', 'offspring', 'often', 'drunk', 'having', 'parties', 'Smilla', 'spent', 'time', 'reading', 'stories', 'Isaiah', 'latter', 'feels', 'connection', 'Smilla', 'part-Greenlander', 'late', 'mother', 'side.She', 'automatically', 'suspicious', 'hostile', 'neighbour', 'hers', 'man', 'billed', 'Mechanic', 'who', 'attracted', 'one', 'time', 'why', 'tongue', 'so', 'rough', 'shoots', 'back', 'quot', 'try', 'be', 'rough', 'quot', 'leaving', 'Mechanic', 'also', 'have', 'cared', 'Isaiah', 'help', 'reluctant', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'checkered', 'past', 'police', 'try', 'use', 'exploiting', 'claustrophobia', 'get', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'spent', 'childhood', 'Greenland', 'being', 'used', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'personal', 'hell', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'tiny', 'spaces.Her', 'moment', 'philosophy', 'when', 'Mechanic', 'why', 'mathematics', 'human', 'life', 'positive', 'integers', 'are', 'numbers', 'child', 'longing', 'when', 'his/her', 'consciousness', 'expands', 'fills', 'longing', 'Negative', 'numbers', 'thus', 'become', 'equation', 'longing-', 'quot', 'formalization', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something.', 'quot', 'fractions', 'represent', 'spaces', 'stones', 'people', 'etc', 'Math', 'thus', 'large', 'landscape', 'much', 'Greenland', 'where', 'horizons', 'never', 'end', 'always', 'recede.Even', 'father', 'doctor', 'difficult', 'connect', 'now', 'married', 'Benja', 'annoying', 'blonde', 'who', 'way', 'irritate', 'lunch', 'when', 'Smilla', 'father', 'suspicious', 'result', 'Isaiah', 'autopsy', 'Benja', 'loudly', 'put', 'off', 'food', 'However', 'father', 'patient', 'enough', 'firm', 'enough', 'Benja', 'provide', 'balance', 'precarious', 'lead', 'Smilla', 'Greenland', 'Mining', 'where', 'Isaiah', 'father', 'worked', 'died', 'accident', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Andreas', 'Tork', 'head', 'GM', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Loyen', 'doctor', 'responsible', 'autopsy', 'suspect', 'clearly', 'conspiracy', 'coverup', 'going', 'Things', 'go', 'espionage', 'mode', 'end', 'where', 'things', 'lose', 'credibility.As', 'mostly', 'unsmiling', 'anti-hero', 'Smilla', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'full', 'portrayal', 'someone', 'unapproachable', 'headstrong', 'rough', 'people', 'regardless', 'feelings', 'someone', 'who', 'justice', 'soul', 'young', 'friend', 'be', 'peace', 'So', 'different', 'title', 'character', 'portrayal', 'remake', 'Sabrina', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'only', 'other', 'laudable', 'character', 'father', 'Moritz', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'so-so', 'performance', 'mysterious', 'Mechanic', 'cold', 'grayness', 'Copenhagen', 'vast', 'snowscape', 'Greenland', 'add', 'forbidding', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'unevenness', 'slow-drawn', 'investigation', 'James', 'Bond-like', 'espionage', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A
159730,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0793941806,Dennis Littrell,"[12, 16]","The Inuit people of the north are said to have a myriad of ways to say snow.  There is snow in the morning, snow in the evening, snow that has freshly fallen and snow on the ground for a week.  Snow seen and snow felt.  Snow that has turned to ice.  Just as we have many ways to say money--moola, loot, cash, dinero, lucre, wampum, etc.--because it is so important to us, so it is with snow for people who live in it all year round.  Thus we have the seminal idea for this flick: Snow-savvy Smilla (Julia Ormond) knows that the six-year-old boy she had befriended didn't just fall off of a roof to his death.  She can tell that he was running from someone in fear of his life because of the appearance of his footprints in the snow on the roof.  (If only the logic of the rest of the movie were as plausible.)In some ways Julia Ormond as Smilla reminds me of the French La Femme Nikita (1990) starring Anne Parillaud.  Smilla, who was born and raised in Greenland and therefore knows all about snow, affects a snappy anti-social stance, an abiding cynicism and a foul mouth while displaying the physical prowess of a lioness.  She also has Nikita's abhorrence of being locked up.  But I wouldn't want to make too much of the comparison since this movie, which begins sprightly enough, soon deteriorates into a murky, clich&eacute;-enriched, murder yarn that eventually morphs into a grade ""B"" science fiction thriller gone astray.  The striking sense of originality (obviously the product of the popular novel by Peter Hoeg) gives way, under Bille August's direction, to a tiresome vapidity reminiscent of bad TV.This is not to say that this movie doesn't have some redeeming qualities.  Ormond does a creditable job although we can see from the shots of her running in the snow that she's not exactly a world class athlete and therefore not capable of some of the heroics of her character.  She's nice to look at, though, and director Bille August keeps the camera on her interesting face as much as possible.  The edgy, amusing and psychologically veracious relationship between her and her father's very young wife is one of the highlights of the movie and might have been expanded.  The snow is beautiful and affecting, and the work of some of the bit players is excellent.

It feels like an arty, beautiful European movie mixed together with an X-Files episode, with some goiod acting and some bad acting.A little boy (Clipper Miano) falls from a Copenhagen rooftop. His neighbor and friend Smilla is immediately suspicious: Isaiah was afraid of heights, and his footsteps go straight to the edge as if he were chased off. (You don't need a special ""sense of snow"" to know that those bits of evidence are suspicious!) Though Smilla voices her suspicions, the police and doctors brush her off, claiming that it was just an accident. Of course, Smilla won't accept that.Her mysterious ally and lover (Gabriel Byrne) seems to be either helping or hindering her as she searches for the truth about why Isaiah was murdered. The discovery of a supposedly-dead threat and a mysterious series of expeditions to Greenland will take Smilla on a dangerous journey to her old homeland -- and a bizarre secret that could destroy her.One of the striking things about the movie is the sort of cold cleanness of it, especially in the various apartment buildings, where there isn't even dust in the corners under the stairs. (I suppose it's in keeping with the snow-and-ice theme) There's a lot of snow and ice, and unfortunately the movie sometimes seems icy too. Because I have not yet read the book, I don't know how much of this is due to Hoeg's book, but a different soundtrack and different direction would have made it feel less X-Filesian. As it is, the direction itself is quite nice, with lots of beautiful shots and good camerawork.There are a few too many obstacles overcome by weird means in this movie; some of the plot twists will probably seem to come out of right field, giving this the attitude of a sort of Danish X-Files episode (complete with brilliant sidekicks, mystery allies, and a conspiracy). The viewers who don't like scifi realism (not space operas) won't like some of the plot twists. I didn't mind them, but I didn't have much of a problem either.Julia Ormond does not work as Smilla: She's obviously supposed to be tough, scrappy and abrasive (sort of a female Dirty Harry) with a hidden vulnerable side, but unfortunately she can't manage it. (For example, when making the crotch-fungus comment, she sounds almost apologetic) Gabriel Byrne is quite good as the Mechanic, although his role is a bit empty compared to Smilla's. Vanessa Redgrave is good as the ultra-religious Elsa, and Richard Harris is also pretty good as Andreas Tork, a very crepy older man. And Clipper Miano is great as Isaiah, a cute little boy with very expressive eyes.""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" is not really a bad movie, but it definitely isn't a very good one. With a different lead actress it would have been a pretty good movie, but Ormond just can't carry the film. Aside from that, it's an acceptable suspense movie with some SF twists.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 11]","SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW (1997) attracted me because my brother worked on a classified project in Greenland a decade before this film was released. The film is set in Copenhagen, but the beginning and 'final action' take place in Greenland.Based on Peter Hoeg's bestseller, this is a story about a half-Inuit, half-American nasty-piece-of-work, Smilla (the intrepid Julia Ormond, TEMPLE GRANDIN, THE CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, SABRINA). Smilla discovers her best friend, Isaiah, a little 9-year-old Inuit boy (the charming Clipper Miano), dead from a rooftop fall.What follows is in the worst ""X-Files"" tradition, involving secret bases in Greenland, a meteorite that is alive, and... when will these silly contrivances end?? With a Who's Who(m) of British talent- Gabriel Byrne, Tom Wilkinson, Jim Broadbent, Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave, and a surprise role by Italian-American giant Robert Loggia- well, I HAD to see it through its miserable 130 minutes!The Euro-near-noir, the suspense, and the pathetic stab at sci-fi was too much to resist. THE X-FILES (1998) would follow a storyline suspiciously similar to this (and similarly rotten). The actions are illogical to the extreme. The characters are unexplained, simply dropped into the film at odd moments. The stellar cast is nothing more than a series of walk-on parts.Oh: also, this movie has no ending. It has a final shot, of course, as if the director and producers didn't know what else to do. It feels like a sinking ship and they abandoned us there with it. Danish Director Billie August (best recognized for doing a couple of ""The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"") tried his best here.What is attractive (I guess) is the freakish nature of the production. The thirst for paranormal, alien, supernatural, zombie and horror crap was just picking up steam in 1997. I blame it all on ""The X-Files"" and its silly, short-lived spinoff, ""Lone Gunmen"". Chris Carter, to be blamed for the X-Phenomenon-Craze, ruined it for all of us.This film, an example of that ruination, is also proof of how to ruin even a good B-movie potential.

She is now an adult who has a sixth sense about events and people. She is walking home from her job when an ambulance drives by, she stops where a crowd has gathered. She sees the body of a child lying in the snow. She knows the little boy. He and his mother, both from Greenland, lived in her apartment complex. The official verdict is ... Esai was playing on the roof and he accidentally fell to his death. Smilla does not believe it. She visits the coroner's office (wondering why an autopsy was required *if* indeed it was an accident). She is told ""it is routine."" She digs further, as she notes that Esai's steps on the roof are in a straight-line which indicates to her, he was not playing. Children at play run about in different directions. Her father is a local doctor, she quizzes him and ends up with more questions than answers.A man living in her apartment, who also misses Esai, tries to comfort Smilla. Smilla resists. She later seeks comfort in his arms and they become lovers ... Smilla is given a gift from Esai's mother, it is a box containing a collection of precious belongings, one of which is a tape-recording. Smilla can not make out the words on the tape but takes it to an expert ... A blind man who worked on excavations in Greenland. He interprets the words for Smilla which indicates there was some cover-up by the mining company that had hired Esai's father to work in Greenland. He had died in a mining accident in 1993 but some mysterious event also occurred then which involved Esai.When Smilla goes to pick up the tape, she discovers the scientist murdered. The door to his ship is locked shut. There is a huge explosion and fire ... Smilla narrowly escapes with her life. She goes to hide out at her father's home. She knows the mining company executive is somehow involved in covering up some mysterious event which occured in Greenland and that Esai was involved ...Smilla sees an argument ensue between a white haired gentleman and Esai's mother at his funeral. It turns out he is the top executive of the mining company for which Esai's father worked. Smilla is certain the mining company is trying to silence her from searching further into Esai's death and his father's mining accident (which she suspects was not an accident at all). Smilla confides in her boyfriend who has a friend associated with a shipping company that recruits for excavavations to Greenland. Smilla manages to be hired as the laundress on board one of the largest excavation ships to Greenland ...There are many twists and turns to this amazing story before the mysterious cover up by the mining company is solved. Smilla accomplishes her goals with the help of the captain's son, who makes suggestive overtures toward her but who ends up becoming her ally in the quest to solve the death of an innocent young boy. The dangerous game of pursuing the mining company executive and uncovering the truth becomes more intense and harrowing ... Smilla and her boyfriend triumph in the end, with the unwitting help of the Captain of the excavation ship. The spell-binding scenery in Greenland is astonishing. This is the first film ever to be made in the forbidding climate of the most Northern country in the world.

159743,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0793941806,K. Boullosa,"[5, 6]","Let me state immediately that while I liked this film, it does not remotely begin to convey the multi-layered density of Peter Hoeg's long, complex novel. This film should be more aptly titled, ""Bille August's Cliff Notes of Peter Hoeg's Novel, Smilla's Sense of Snow"". Because that, basically, is what this movie is: a sketch of major events from the book, and not even all of them.Of course, it must be said that bringing all the plots, subplots, twists, turns, and subtleties of Hoeg's novel to the screen in one film was probably impossible. Thus, August, I suppose, is to be congratulated for even trying to convey some sense of the book's primary themes about identity, power, and responsibility.Fortunately, the film works quite well on its own terms, so if you haven't read Hoeg's novel, this film functions more than respectably in the suspense genre, and features a finely focused performance by Julia Ormond as the protagonist, Smilla Jaspersen. Ms. Ormond is really very good, and it is a pity she spent even ten minutes in Hollywood trying to become a Real Movie Star in silly movies like Sidney Pollack's disastrous remake of ""Sabrina"", ""Guinevere"", and, to a slightly lesser extent, ""Legends of the Fall"". The role of Smilla shows more of her range, talent, and emotional commitment than all three of those films wrapped up together.Smilla is a half-Greenlandic/half-Danish scientist/mathemetician who has never been able to reconcile her two cultural heritages. Her Danish father, smoothly played by Robert Loggia, is also a scientist, and brought a young Smilla back to Denmark after her Inuit mother died in the Arctic waters off Greenland.  And, as Smilla's mother was the love of her father's life, Dr. Jasperson's rage and grief at her loss left little care and love within him for the strong-willed little daughter who was also devastated by the loss. Smilla, who spent her entire childhood in Greenland among her mother's people, has never really adjusted to life in Copenhagen or to a European lifestyle.  She misses Greenland's vast snowy expanses and suffers from the horror of small spaces that often afflicts those brought up in Greenland. As the film opens, Smilla is a sad, prickly, conflicted woman in her late thirties, difficult to approach and contemptuous of all systems save mathematics. She specializes in the science of snow, and translates all human experience through the language of mathematics.The only human being who seems to have pierced her armor, and only after considerable effort, is a little boy who lives in her apartment building. Isaiah is also Inuit, and often takes refuge with Smilla when his widowed mother embarks on one of her long drinking binges. One day, Smilla comes home from work to find Isaiah dead in front of the apartment house, having ostensibly fallen off the roof while playing alone there. One look at his footsteps on the snowy roof convinces Smilla that Isaiah's death was no accident, and she sets out to find out what really happened to him.As she does so, she uncovers a series of betrayals and multiple levels of corruption at the highest levels of government and scientific research. Her dogged pursuit of Isaiah's murderers puts a cynical and corrupt band of ruthless men on her trail, and places her in considerable danger.The movie is stylishly produced and well-acted, with plenty of suspense as the destinies of the protagonists cross. Gabriel Byrne as another of Smilla's neighbors who is not quite what he seems; Richard Harris, Tom Wilkinson, and Bob Peck as the villainous conspirators; and a brief but sharply drawn cameo by Vanessa Redgrave as a conscience-stricken company official, all contribute to the high standard of performance in the film.But the movie is anchored by Ormond's Smilla, whose journey to avenge Isaiah and illuminate the truth about his fate becomes part of her search for the answer to the question of who she is. There are some fine moments in the film, and a beautiful, haunting score. No, it's not Hoeg's novel, but one would probably need three movies for that. This one, however, is still well worth watching.",3,The Smilla Cliff Notes,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,4128,"['Let', 'state', 'immediately', 'liked', 'film', 'not', 'remotely', 'begin', 'convey', 'multi-layered', 'density', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'long', 'complex', 'novel', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Bille', 'August', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'Novel', 'Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'basically', 'what', 'movie', 'sketch', 'major', 'events', 'book', 'not', 'even', 'them.Of', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'bringing', 'plots', 'subplots', 'twists', 'turns', 'subtleties', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'screen', 'one', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'impossible', 'Thus', 'August', 'suppose', 'be', 'congratulated', 'even', 'trying', 'convey', 'sense', 'book', 'primary', 'themes', 'identity', 'power', 'responsibility.Fortunately', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'own', 'terms', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'film', 'more', 'respectably', 'suspense', 'genre', 'finely', 'focused', 'performance', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'protagonist', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'Ms.', 'Ormond', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'pity', 'spent', 'even', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'become', 'Real', 'Movie', 'Star', 'silly', 'movies', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'disastrous', 'remake', 'Sabrina', 'Guinevere', 'slightly', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'role', 'Smilla', 'more', 'range', 'talent', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'three', 'films', 'wrapped', 'up', 'together.Smilla', 'half-Greenlandic/half-Danish', 'scientist/mathemetician', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'reconcile', 'two', 'cultural', 'heritages', 'Danish', 'father', 'smoothly', 'played', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'also', 'scientist', 'brought', 'young', 'Smilla', 'back', 'Denmark', 'Inuit', 'mother', 'died', 'Arctic', 'waters', 'off', 'Greenland', 'Smilla', 'mother', 'was', 'love', 'father', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Jasperson', 'rage', 'grief', 'loss', 'left', 'little', 'care', 'love', 'strong-willed', 'little', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'devastated', 'loss', 'Smilla', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'childhood', 'Greenland', 'mother', 'people', 'never', 'really', 'adjusted', 'life', 'Copenhagen', 'European', 'lifestyle', 'Greenland', 'vast', 'snowy', 'expanses', 'suffers', 'horror', 'small', 'spaces', 'often', 'brought', 'up', 'Greenland', 'film', 'Smilla', 'sad', 'prickly', 'conflicted', 'woman', 'late', 'thirties', 'difficult', 'approach', 'contemptuous', 'systems', 'save', 'mathematics', 'science', 'snow', 'human', 'experience', 'language', 'mathematics.The', 'only', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'have', 'pierced', 'armor', 'only', 'considerable', 'effort', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'apartment', 'building', 'Isaiah', 'also', 'Inuit', 'often', 'refuge', 'Smilla', 'when', 'widowed', 'mother', 'embarks', 'one', 'long', 'drinking', 'binges', 'One', 'day', 'Smilla', 'home', 'work', 'find', 'Isaiah', 'dead', 'front', 'apartment', 'house', 'having', 'ostensibly', 'fallen', 'off', 'roof', 'playing', 'alone', 'there', 'One', 'look', 'footsteps', 'snowy', 'roof', 'convinces', 'Smilla', 'Isaiah', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'him.As', 'so', 'series', 'betrayals', 'multiple', 'levels', 'corruption', 'highest', 'levels', 'government', 'scientific', 'research', 'dogged', 'pursuit', 'Isaiah', 'murderers', 'cynical', 'corrupt', 'band', 'ruthless', 'men', 'trail', 'considerable', 'danger.The', 'movie', 'stylishly', 'produced', 'well-acted', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'destinies', 'protagonists', 'cross', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Smilla', 'neighbors', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bob', 'Peck', 'villainous', 'conspirators', 'brief', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'cameo', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'conscience-stricken', 'company', 'official', 'contribute', 'high', 'standard', 'performance', 'film.But', 'movie', 'anchored', 'Ormond', 'Smilla', 'journey', 'avenge', 'Isaiah', 'illuminate', 'truth', 'fate', 'part', 'search', 'answer', 'question', 'who', 'are', 'fine', 'moments', 'film', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'score', 'No', 'not', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'need', 'three', 'movies', 'one', 'however', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Looney,"[3, 4]","That being said, it was inevitable that some bits from Peter Heg's novel be rushed or left out completely - the book was nearly 500 pages, and very detailed.  A film including everything Heg wrote would wind up well over three hours long - not something that's easy to get viewers to sit through.  As it is, August's direction combined with Ann Biderman's screenplay give us a pretty acceptable screen version of this thriller.The cast includes some heavyweights. Julia Ormond in the role of Smilla, Gabriel Byrne as the mechanic, and the great Vanessa Redgrave in a small but important (more so in the novel) role as Elsa Lubing (a source of crucial information for Smilla) - all do fine jobs.  Richard Harris appears as the industrialist Tork, and Robert Loggia as Smilla's father - their performances are a little harder to accept, especially Loggia's.  It's not that he's not a fine actor - but in the novel, Smilla's father is Danish, whereas in the film version, Loggia's accent makes it impossible for him to be mentioned as anything but an American.These are actually minor complaints - overall, the novel's story and spirit is brought to the screen well in this version.  Ormond does an especially nice job capturing her character's combination of charm and coldness - the underlying psychological subtleties (hinted at in the film, laid out more thoroughly in the novel) are given a nice turn.The story opens with Smilla coming home to see that a neighbor boy - her 6 year-old friend Isaiah - has fallen to his death from the roof of the building where they live.  As she comforts his distraught mother, she's already wondering why the boy was on the roof, knowing that he had a fear of heights.  As she begins to look into the case herself - much to the consternation of the Copenhagen police, who immediately rule the boy's death an accident - she finds more and more doors closed to her.  Her determination to get to the bottom of things leads her through those doors (or, metaphorically, adjacent windows...) - and she begins to uncover more and more clues that lead her to believe that Isaiah was murdered.  She enlists the aid of `the mechanic', another tenant in her building - and their relationship, much to her surprise, develops into a romantic one.Smilla continues to pursue the mystery - uncovering corporate shenanigans, greed, corruption, murder and other niceties along the way.  The film follows the story of the novel pretty closely, and builds to an exciting climax - it felt a little rushed to me near the end, but as I said, there's only so much time.  Overall, this is a pretty nicely done adaptation of a suspenseful story, well-acted as well.

159749,A3J9V8R4PYA9GW,0793941806,"lisebouvier ""lisebouvier""","[5, 12]","An intellectual thriller is such a rarity. I'd never heard ofthe book, so I went to see it with no expectations and an openmind. At the beginning, I was pleased and intrigued. So many interesting issues.  Racism, indigenous peoples, alcoholism. Not to mention a keen mystery, and Ms. Ormond drugging guard dogs, climbing fences, saying things that would label her the b$!ch in other movies. Great! However, as the plot unrolled it seemed to me that most of what drew me in was just window dressing. I began to get the feeling that the director had no respect for his audience.  This was a movie that took itself seriously, drew you in to take it seriously, then did things that if you were taking it seriously, you couldn't possibly take seriously. The first real problem occurred when the boat explodes and the Mechanic (&quot;rescue central&quot;) pulls up just in time, having miraculously (or clairvoyantly) figured out exactly where she was and how to arrive just in time. I mean, come on!  They have a phone conversation, he hears a boat horn, and from that knows where she is.  Copenhagen is a port city, guys! If you've read the book, maybe you can make this make sense, but I hadn't. A movie shouldn't depend on your having read the book to make a sense of a scene like that. Well, I liked the whole premise of the movie, so I pretty much tried to hang on no matter how it stretched my suspension of disbelief, though I had a real problem with the way no matter how improbable it is that the mechanic will appear and rescue Smilla, he does, and/or every time she's being menaced, it's just him. Another scene that annoyed me was when Smilla finds the video, conveniently sitting on top of the pile, conveniently queued-up to where it needs to be, and stands there watching it in the open, in a place we've been told over and over again it's dangerous for her to be. Again, no respect for the audience. But what finally did it for me was that shower scene, where it looks like Smilla's going to have to fight for her life, but it turns out to be...The Mechanic. It seemed cynical to me, because the director deliberately draws you in to believe she's in danger, then pulls the rug out from under you, like in some horror movie. It was just too much in a movie full of those moments. I stopped caring about the characters.  They were no longer real to me. Ms. Ormond referred to it as a good script, but I couldn't help wondering-didn't she notice all those flaws in logic and good storytelling?  Anyway, on the plus side it is well acted, visually haunting, and has a good soundtrack. If you know better than to take the story seriously, you can enjoy it.  But I can't help but wonder what the movie would have been, if the director could have jettisoned the silly plot, and had had more respect for his audience. It could have been something really special.",2,Two and a half stars,948067200,"01 17, 2000",2000,2866,"['intellectual', 'thriller', 'such', 'rarity', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'ofthe', 'book', 'went', 'see', 'expectations', 'openmind', 'beginning', 'was', 'pleased', 'intrigued', 'So', 'many', 'interesting', 'issues', 'Racism', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'alcoholism', 'Not', 'mention', 'keen', 'mystery', 'Ms.', 'Ormond', 'drugging', 'guard', 'dogs', 'climbing', 'fences', 'saying', 'things', 'would', 'label', 'b', 'ch', 'other', 'movies', 'Great', 'However', 'plot', 'unrolled', 'seemed', 'most', 'what', 'drew', 'was', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'began', 'get', 'feeling', 'director', 'had', 'respect', 'audience', 'was', 'movie', 'took', 'seriously', 'drew', 'take', 'seriously', 'then', 'did', 'things', 'were', 'taking', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'take', 'seriously', 'first', 'real', 'problem', 'occurred', 'when', 'boat', 'explodes', 'Mechanic', 'quot', 'central', 'quot', 'up', 'just', 'time', 'having', 'miraculously', 'clairvoyantly', 'figured', 'out', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'how', 'arrive', 'just', 'time', 'mean', 'come', 'have', 'phone', 'conversation', 'boat', 'horn', 'where', 'Copenhagen', 'port', 'city', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'maybe', 'can', 'make', 'make', 'sense', 'had', ""n't"", 'A', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'depend', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'make', 'sense', 'scene', 'Well', 'liked', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'tried', 'hang', 'matter', 'how', 'stretched', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'had', 'real', 'problem', 'way', 'matter', 'how', 'improbable', 'mechanic', 'will', 'appear', 'rescue', 'Smilla', 'and/or', 'time', 'being', 'menaced', 'just', 'scene', 'annoyed', 'was', 'when', 'Smilla', 'video', 'conveniently', 'sitting', 'top', 'pile', 'conveniently', 'queued-up', 'where', 'be', 'watching', 'open', 'place', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'dangerous', 'be', 'Again', 'respect', 'audience', 'what', 'finally', 'did', 'was', 'shower', 'scene', 'where', 'Smilla', 'going', 'have', 'fight', 'life', 'out', 'be', 'Mechanic', 'seemed', 'cynical', 'director', 'deliberately', 'believe', 'danger', 'then', 'rug', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'full', 'moments', 'stopped', 'caring', 'characters', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'real', 'Ms.', 'Ormond', 'referred', 'good', 'script', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering-did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'flaws', 'logic', 'good', 'storytelling', 'Anyway', 'plus', 'side', 'well', 'acted', 'visually', 'haunting', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'know', 'better', 'take', 'story', 'seriously', 'can', 'enjoy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'jettisoned', 'silly', 'plot', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'respect', 'audience', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'really', 'special']",N/A

The scientific premise of a meteor with bizarre properties that can generate great energy and power is more than a little bit hokey, but it makes up for that in other ways. Smilla's character is unusual and the way her deep knowledge of ice and snow enables her to sleuth out the truth about the boy's death is a unique touch. The beautiful Julia Ormand plays the conflicted and anti-social Smilla across from Gabriel Byrne, the ambiguous but sympathetic neighbor who seems to like Smilla despite her crusty demeanor and who helps her with her investigations. The movie gets off to a good start as the viewer follows Smilla in her investigation of the boy's mysterious death, but the movie turns distinctly hokey about half-way through when it becomes sort of a B movie, sci-fi thriller when the secret plot is discovered about the strangely powerful meteorite. But the movie succeeds mainly on the strength of Smilla's fascinating character and how her Greenlander snow knowledge and skills enable her to solve the murder mystery.

159752,A319KYEIAZ3SON,0793941806,Mary Whipple,"[5, 5]","Smilla Jaspersen, the daughter of an American physician father and an Inuit mother from Greenland, has a sixth sense about the snow. Far more connected, emotionally, to her Inuit culture than to the complexities of modern urban life in Copenhagen, where she currently lives, she insists on living on her own terms, uncompromising, independent, and constantly challenging authority. When Isaiah, a six-year-old Inuit child in her apartment building, &quot;falls&quot; from the roof, Smilla studies the snow and knows it is not an accident. Soon she discovers that the child has been having hospital tests once a month, that his father was killed in an explosion in Greenland while working for a mining company, that his mother has been collecting checks from the company--and that she herself is being followed.Julia Ormond's barely suppressed anger perfectly captures Smilla's inner ferocity, and she totally dominates this Bille August-directed film. Vanessa Redgrave plays a cameo role, and Richard Harris is a supporting character, but his primary role is to look menacing as he runs the mining company, which has a powerful secret. Clipper Miano, a 6-year-old Inuit, is wonderful as Isaiah, with his sad, little face and his needy reaching out. Gabriel Byrne, as an enigmatic mechanic who never goes to his shop, plays a role which fits the plot, but he himself remains a mystery throughout, despite his relationship with Smilla. The harshness of the Greenland setting, combined with the snow, the bleak grayness of wintery Copenhagen, the semi-darkness of most of the scenes, and Smilla's own remote coldness create a powerful mood and increase the suspense and unease.The problem with the film, like the novel, is that the psychological study of Smilla, which is the most interesting and best-developed aspect of the story, gets waylaid by pyrotechnics and thriller effects. Explosions, complex medical technology, extinct life forms coming back to life in sci-fi manner, flashbacks of Isaiah's life (designed to tug at the heartstrings), and mysterious ships in the night turn what might have been a brilliant psychological study into a snowbound melodrama. The cinematography is gorgeous and effective, as is Ormond, but neither can save the film from its split personality.

159753,A152C8GYY25HAH,0793941806,Matthew Horner,"[10, 11]","""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" is an unusual, intriguing thriller that seems to fall in the love it or hate it category. If it seems a bit off center to American audiences, that may be because it's a Danish film in English with an almost entirely English cast. So, its point of view, production values and [alas!] its budget are quite Western European. This means its a bit slower, a bit more interested in character development and a lot more poetic and enigmatic than your ordinary thriller. I like it a great deal. To me, its main fault is that some of the story, especially towards the end, requires a much more spectacular and elaborate treatment than the film's producers could afford. In fact, it would not surprise me if it gets an American remake one day because the story is so interesting and visually complex. [Note: I have not read the novel by Peter Hoeg upon which it is based. It is available in paperback here at Amazon.com.]The superb Julia Ormond plays Smilla Jeperson, a beautiful, intelligent and tortured young woman living in Copenhagen. She's a scientist specializing in the study of snow. She's also a person of unusual origins, the daughter of a Danish doctor and a native Greenlander mother. When she was six years old, her mother, a huntress in the icy wilds of Greenland, was killed, and Smilla was brought to Denmark to live. She never adjusted. One day she comes home to her apartment building to find a tragedy has occurred. A young Eskimo boy, an immigrant from Greenland, has been killed. Everyone says he fell from the roof, but Smilla quickly figures out he was murdered. She decides to find out what really happened to a boy she loved. Thus begins a detective story full of twists, turns and unnerving surprises.The great supporting cast includes Vanessa Redgrave, Tom Wilkinson, Jim Broadbent, Richard Harris, Gabriel Byrne and Robert Loggia, but the film very much belongs to Ms. Ormond. The movie was directed by Bille August, whose ""The House of the Spirits"" and ""Pelle the Conqueror"" are highly recommended. The cinematography by Jorgen Persson is icily beautiful - filled with shades of blues and while. The haunting and evocative music is by Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams.",4,Julia Ormond stunning in unusual thriller,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,2219,"['Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'unusual', 'intriguing', 'thriller', 'fall', 'love', 'hate', 'category', 'bit', 'off', 'center', 'American', 'audiences', 'may', 'be', 'Danish', 'film', 'English', 'almost', 'entirely', 'English', 'cast', 'So', 'point', 'view', 'production', 'values', '[', 'alas', ']', 'budget', 'are', 'quite', 'Western', 'European', 'bit', 'slower', 'bit', 'more', 'interested', 'character', 'development', 'lot', 'more', 'poetic', 'enigmatic', 'ordinary', 'thriller', 'like', 'great', 'deal', 'main', 'fault', 'story', 'especially', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'spectacular', 'elaborate', 'treatment', 'film', 'producers', 'could', 'afford', 'fact', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'American', 'remake', 'one', 'day', 'story', 'so', 'interesting', 'visually', 'complex', '[', 'Note', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'based', 'available', 'paperback', 'here', 'Amazon.com', ']', 'superb', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Smilla', 'Jeperson', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'tortured', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'Copenhagen', 'scientist', 'specializing', 'study', 'snow', 'also', 'person', 'unusual', 'origins', 'daughter', 'Danish', 'doctor', 'native', 'Greenlander', 'mother', 'When', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'mother', 'huntress', 'icy', 'wilds', 'Greenland', 'was', 'killed', 'Smilla', 'was', 'brought', 'Denmark', 'live', 'never', 'adjusted', 'One', 'day', 'home', 'apartment', 'building', 'find', 'tragedy', 'occurred', 'young', 'Eskimo', 'boy', 'immigrant', 'Greenland', 'been', 'killed', 'Everyone', 'fell', 'roof', 'Smilla', 'quickly', 'out', 'was', 'murdered', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'boy', 'loved', 'Thus', 'detective', 'story', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'unnerving', 'surprises.The', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'belongs', 'Ms.', 'Ormond', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Bille', 'August', 'House', 'Spirits', 'Pelle', 'Conqueror', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'cinematography', 'Jorgen', 'Persson', 'icily', 'beautiful', 'filled', 'shades', 'blues', 'while', 'haunting', 'evocative', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Harry', 'Gregson-Williams']",N/A
159754,A4RQ549E9K6B4,0793941806,Michael S. Fleischer,"[2, 3]","Isaiah Christiansen (Clipper Miano), a beautiful Inuit boy, died prematurely. According to police, the six-year-old suffered an accidental fall from unsupervised play on the rooftop of his low income, multi-story Copenhagen apartment building where he lived with his recently widowed mother, Juliane (Agga Olsen), a lapsed alcoholic. As we watch the camera pan the malnourished body of the lifeless boy, lying facedown in a crimson pool of blood, sickingly paled by the steely twilight of a Midwinter Danish sky, his neighbor, Smilla Jaspersen (Julia Ormand), will be caught off guard at the horror about to greet her upon returning home from work as an underemployed research scientist specializing in the microscopic analysis of snow, a poor substitute for her self-destructed academic career. Reclusive and rebellious, Smilla, befriended Isaiah reluctantly, out of compassion of his father's untimely death and his mother's neglect, finding an immediate empathetic connection with the mop-headed toddler. It belied her usual sullen and misanthropic persona. Smilla ""lost"" her mother (Maliinannguaq Markussen-Mlgrd in flashback) at his age, fatally consumed by frigid Arctic melt waters, in contrast to the cold indifference of the bottle. She succumbed to her watery fate, instantly, when her kayak, overloaded with catch, catastrophically capsized. Seeing Isaiah's delicate, fractured frame splayed on the frozen ground, Smilla seethes inwardly, but is visibly shaken. She climbs the unit's spiral staircase up the building's open foyer to the rooftop and is immediately drawn toward Isaiah's snowy footfalls, which trace a pernicious beeline to the void beyond the railess edges. She intuits the deaf boy's fear of heights, and subsequent 'fall,' could not have been the result of playful mishap. Voicing her suspicions to supercilious investigators at the scene, Smilla returns to her apartment, heartbroken, haunted by memories of Isaiah that loop in her mind like possessed videotape. A scrambled audiotape, carefully concealed by Isaiah in the building's vestibule, however, will play a stalking role in this story. Isaiah was the only soul able to conquer Smilla's affections, and he did so in a most unusual love match, consisting of tearful, hot baths and unlikely interest in her whimsical tales of real and imaginary numbers--of forlorn fractions pining for equilibrium and aliquant fractions receding, indivisibly, into the hidden realm. Smilla loves mathematics and geometry, and her stories liberated them, if only temporarily, from their intolerable urban confinement, which the darkly beautiful, half-Inuit native Greenlander, particularly loathes. Long dependent on the beneficence of her American father, physician Moritz Jaspersen (Robert Loggia), a matter that has incited angst in her mother's feckless successor, Benja (Emma Croft), several years her junior, Smilla barely tolerates her father's late middle-aged fantasy, a youthful trophy and unabashed gold-digger. Mutual enmity will ensnare Smilla and Benja in a grim, cat-and-mouse game with the authorities (Matthew Marsh as the Detective and Patrick Field as the Police Officer) bent on extinguishing Smilla's fiery pursuit of the truth underlying Isaiah's fate. Notwithstanding, Smilla's Inuit duty is to avenge Isaiah's death and make someone, or something, pay for it, and ease his restive spirit, setting it free from the authorities' callous disregard of facts. She vows to right this wrong before Christmas, which she refuses to celebrate, resolving to never again summon failure into her life.Before Koji Suzuki's The Ring trilogy and companion short story, Dark Water, Peter Hoeg's 1992 bestselling novel, Smilla's Sense of Snow, was adapted into a feature film in 1997, by producers Bernd Eichinger, Rosanne Korenberg, and Martin Moszkowicz. Screenwriter Ann Biderman and director Bille August breathed cinematic life into Hoeg's gripping tale. Like the spate of recently released, psychological thrillers, Smilla's Sense of Snow, remastered and distributed by 20th Century Fox for DVD in 2002, plumbs the icy depths of distraught, broken families--particularly disaffected, abused, and neglected children. The surrogate parents who fill-in--usually unexpectedly or reluctantly--do so as de facto role models, often atoning as much for their own ""sins"" as those of their charges' natural parents. Like Suzuki's ghostly tomes, splashes of alchemy and metaphysics infuse Smilla in an intoxicating blend of Western Apocalyptic mythology and Eastern animism, positing an ever-flowing cycle of spiritual inhabitation of Inuit souls, and all phenomena. This volatile mixture, echoed in Smilla's diverse heritage, also fuels her inner turmoil. The film's opening sequence, shown in flashback, metaphorically foreshadows this in a conflagration of fire and ice, in an astronomical event that rocked 19th Century Greenland. The scene is described to Smilla, later, in a narrative reading from St. John's Revelation, serendipitously opened in a Bible owned by a late-in-life called nun, Elsa L&uuml;bing (Vanessa Redgrave), who recounts how a ""fallen star"" (meteorite) plowed into the Earth, and bored a ""bottomless"" pit into the bowels of the frozen Artic, as witnessed by a doomed Inuit hunter (Ono Fleischer, no relation). During her interview with L&uuml;bing, Smilla confirms the born again ""bride of Jesus"" worked as an account manager at the Greenland Mining Company (GMC). In her former life, she co-signed the concern's pension payments and award letter to Isaiah's mother, Juliane, adding a personal note of sympathy into its margins, following the mysterious death of her husband in glacial melt water, with Isaiah at his side, while away at a company excavation.Gabriel Byrne plays ""The Mechanic,"" another neighbor of Isaiah's who, like Smilla, loved the boy, and mourns him deeply. With atypically ""clean hands"" and aplomb The Mechanic assists Smilla, fortuitously popping into her fray with the authorities when matters heat-up, and providing her with sage advice on how to proceed with her investigation. Smilla suspects he is hiding something, but she is, at once, attracted to, and daunted by, his shadowy character and appearances. Theirs is a mostly off-again/on-again romance. Superb cameo performances by Jim Broadbent as Dr. Langermann, who conducted Isaiah's autopsy, and whom Smilla learns was surreptitiously replaced midstream by Professor Loyen (Tom Wilkinson), a Greenland Mining physician, under the direction of GMC's leader, Dr. Andreas Tork (the late Richard Harris), for whom snow and ice, too, plays a definitive role, aptly contribute to the plot, drawing Smilla back to her native Greenland. Some have faulted the film's latter half for being overly action-oriented, but such forays are in keeping with Smilla's relentless nature and temperament, and her contempt for those who unjustly wield power and privilege.Heart-rending, Smilla's Sense of Snow remains faithful to Hoeg's captivating novel where it matters most. The Ring composer, Hans Zimmer, along with Ryeland Allison, and Harry Gregson-Williams, movingly score the film, which is beautifully cinematographed by J&ouml;rgen Persson, and crisply edited by Janus Billeskov Jansen. All soundly deliver a provocative message of the plight of innocent children who suffer in a corruptible adult world, whether at the hands of neglectful parents, fraudulent corporations, unethical scientists, or insolent law enforcement officials.",4,"Finding ""Ice"" in Justice",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,7502,"['Isaiah', 'Christiansen', 'Clipper', 'Miano', 'beautiful', 'Inuit', 'boy',

The lead character, Smilla, is motherless, sad, lost, fierce, loyal and in desperate need of something or someone to get her interested in life again.

159756,A263ORUL49HIZZ,0793941806,"MoE ""MoE""","[3, 3]","Based on Peter Hoeg's novel (one that is well worth reading), Smilla's Sense of Snow takes the viewer to places never really travelled before.  This is a journey to snow cold and ice, from Denmark to Greenland.  Like Iceman or the Thing, this is a perfect antidote to the heat of a summer day.  Coopenhagen is probably a very lovely city, but in this film, in Smilla's eyes, it is a drab and dreary place.  The beauty of Greenland's vast and open spaces shines through, giving equal parts of calm and menace.The mystery is a good one, and the plight of the young Innuit boy is made clear from the start.  Looking at the small body from the height it has fallen is disturbing and very sad.  You understand immediately why Smilla would want to find out what she could about the boy's death.  As the mystery unfolds, you realize that this is far afield from what you thought was the original answer.  Some of the surprises are telegraphed, which make the unexpected twists and turns all that much more surprising.  The book, of course, has much more detail, but the movie is a well done streamlined version, keeping the original firmly in mind.  The only qualms with book vs movie are at the very very beginning and the conclusion, which is decidedly different.The picture and the sound on the DVD are amazing.  The transfer is well done, and if you see this movie in any other form other than widescreen, you are missing out tremendously.  The 5-1 sound is spectacular, especially when the movie moves to  Greenland.  There is a 5 minute featurette, which is better than most American featurette (don't expect the trailer shots to be used here--this is the cast and crew in Greenland).  The supporting performances are well done (Robert Loggia, Vanessa Redgrave, and the underrated Jim Broadbent).

159757,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,0793941806,moviemusicbuff,"[4, 4]","I am a longtime fan of Julia Ormond. She is excellent in the short list of movies she's been in:  Legends of the Fall, First Knight, Sabrina, and then this movie.  I wish she would appear in more movies!!  What happened to you, Julia?The film concerns an intelligent woman, Smilla Jaspersen, who investigates the mysterious death of her neighbor friend, Isaiah, who is a young boy.  Smilla is suspicious about the way the investigation of the boy's death is going and she tries to find out who's responsible for the boy's death and how Greenville Mining Company is involved.I have not read the book like some of the other reviewers have, so I cannot judge this movie based on the novel.  I'd like to analyze this movie as a fan of Julia and as a movie buff of mystery/suspense films.The Good:1) Julia Ormond's portrayal of Smilla Jaspersen is outstanding and the redeeming factor of this film.  Julia does an excellent job of portraying the multi-faceted sides of Smilla.  We see her rude and cold demeanor and yet we also see her tenderness and love for the boy and his mother.  We see her alienation and emotional detachment and yet we see her yearning for love and affection.  We see her as a frightened woman when threatened by the bad guys, yet we see her courage and determination in pursuing this case to the end. Smilla is a woman of fierce determination and courage. She will get to the end of investigating this mystery and if there is foul-play or cover-up involved, she'll make sure the bad guys pay for what they've done.  And what's more, she knows everything about snow -- falling snow, tracking snow, snow for building igloos, etc. hence, the title of this movie & novel.2) Smilla's comical relationship with her dad and her dad's young girlfriend.  Some of the most memorable and comical scenes are when Smilla is around her physician dad and his young girlfriend.  Smilla loves and respects her dad but totally hates his girlfriend, who seems slightly younger than Smilla herself.  I loved the verbal ""sword duels"" between Smilla and Benja, the girlfriend.  Here are two women who absolutely despise and hate each other, and yet they are emotionally attached to the same man.  I enjoyed the scenes when the two women were together.3) The tender moments when Smilla is with the boy, Isaiah.  Here, we see the tender side of Smilla. Despite her coldness, she is drawn emotionally to the boy and takes on the role of a surrogate mother and protector of the boy.  These scenes were touching and moving.4) The great lines:  Smilla to Elsa Lubing:  ""The way you have a sense of God, I have a sense of snow"";  The verbal jabs by Smilla to the hated girlfriend of her dad.The Not-So-Good:1) Unbelievable plot lines and ""coincidences"":  How is it that Smilla always meets the Mechanic guy (played by Gabriel Byrne) at exactly the right moment when she is in danger and chased by the bad guys? How does he know exactly where Smilla is aboard the ship?2) How did Smilla survive aboard the ship when she was chased by the bad guys?  Did these guys suddenly give up their chase?The scene when she hides from the bad guys in a wine cellar seems like a plot taken from the Nancy Drew novels.3) The semi-James Bond-like ending.  I won't give away too much except to say that I wish that what began in this movie with a very interesting character study of Smilla ended in a derivative Hollywood, semi-James Bond-like ending.  Why can't movies stick with the character development of the main character without having to resort to a predictable, semi-action type ending?4) No explanation of who the Mechanic guy is.  The movie does not explain who this guy is, why he's there, and what side is he on?  After watching the whole movie, I still don't understand this character.I guess I will have to read the novel to answer some of these questions.In any case,  I recommend this movie based on the Julia Ormond's performance and the excellent first half of the movie, which focusses more on the character development of Smilla, Isaiah and her mother.  If you can forgive the derivative second half and the ending, then you'll like this movie.",4,Julia Ormond's excellent performance redeems this film,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,4140,"['am', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'excellent', 'short', 'list', 'movies', 'been', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'First', 'Knight', 'Sabrina', 'then', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', 'appear', 'more', 'movies', 'What', 'happened', 'Julia', 'film', 'concerns', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'who', 'mysterious', 'death', 'neighbor', 'friend', 'Isaiah', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'Smilla', 'suspicious', 'way', 'investigation', 'boy', 'death', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'responsible', 'boy', 'death', 'how', 'Greenville', 'Mining', 'Company', 'involved.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', ""'d"", 'like', 'analyze', 'movie', 'fan', 'Julia', 'movie', 'buff', 'mystery/suspense', 'films.The', 'Good:1', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'portrayal', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'outstanding', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'film', 'Julia', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'multi-faceted', 'sides', 'Smilla', 'see', 'rude', 'cold', 'demeanor', 'yet', 'also', 'see', 'tenderness', 'love', 'boy', 'mother', 'see', 'alienation', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'yet', 'see', 'yearning', 'love', 'affection', 'see', 'frightened', 'woman', 'when', 'threatened', 'bad', 'guys', 'yet', 'see', 'courage', 'determination', 'pursuing', 'case', 'end', 'Smilla', 'woman', 'fierce', 'determination', 'courage', 'will', 'get', 'end', 'investigating', 'mystery', 'foul-play', 'cover-up', 'involved', ""'ll"", 'make', 'sure', 'bad', 'guys', 'pay', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'what', 'more', 'everything', 'snow', 'falling', 'snow', 'tracking', 'snow', 'snow', 'building', 'igloos', 'etc', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', 'novel.2', 'Smilla', 'comical', 'relationship', 'dad', 'dad', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'memorable', 'comical', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Smilla', 'physician', 'dad', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'Smilla', 'loves', 'dad', 'totally', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'slightly', 'younger', 'Smilla', 'loved', 'verbal', 'sword', 'duels', 'Smilla', 'Benja', 'girlfriend', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'absolutely', 'despise', 'hate', 'other', 'yet', 'are', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'same', 'man', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'when', 'two', 'women', 'were', 'together.3', 'tender', 'moments', 'when', 'Smilla', 'boy', 'Isaiah', 'Here', 'see', 'tender', 'side', 'Smilla', 'coldness', 'drawn', 'emotionally', 'boy', 'role', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'protector', 'boy', 'scenes', 'were', 'touching', 'moving.4', 'great', 'lines', 'Smilla', 'Elsa', 'Lubing', 'way', 'have', 'sense', 'God', 'have', 'sense', 'snow', 'verbal', 'jabs', 'Smilla', 'hated', 'girlfriend', 'dad.The', 'Not-So-Good:1', 'Unbelievable', 'plot', 'lines', 'coincidences', 'How', 'Smilla', 'always', 'Mechanic', 'guy', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'exactly', 'right', 'moment', 'when', 'danger', 'chased', 'bad', 'guys', 'How', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'Smilla', 'ship', '2', 'How', 'did', 'Smilla', 'survive', 'ship', 'when', 'was', 'chased', 'bad', 'guys', 'Did', 'guys', 'suddenly', 'give', 'up', 'chase', 'scene', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'wine', 'cellar', 'plot', 'taken', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'novels.3', 'semi-James', 'Bond-like', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'wish', 'what', 'began', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'Smilla', 'ended', 'derivative', 'Hollywood', 'semi-James', 'Bond-like', 'ending', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movies', 'stick', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'character', 'having', 'resort', 'predictable', 'semi-action', 'type', 'ending', '4', 'explanation', 'who', 'Mechanic', 'guy', 'movie', 'not', 'explain', 'who', 'guy', 'why', 'there', 'what', 'side', 'watching', 'whole', 'movie', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'character.I', 'guess', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'answer', 'questions.In', 'case', 'recommend', 'movie', 'based', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'performance', 'excellent', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'Smilla', 'Isaiah', 'mother', 'can', 'forgive', 'derivative', 'second', 'half', 'ending', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie']",N/A

So  when the film opens its beautifully embroidered chest and goes  &quot;BOO&quot;, you can't help but feel a severe lack of complacency.Julia Ormond stars as Smilla Jaspersen, a half American and half  Greenlandic loner living in a rather downscale neighborhood of Copenhagen.  And for the purposes of this film, Copenhagen is painted as a desolate, icy  and unfeeling place. It is a testament to the morbidity of Smilla that she  feels her life in this grim metropolis is a betrayal of her origins. She  longs for the even icier, crueler and primitive Greenland. Through the  film's complex structure we see her in flashbacks as a six year old where  she was part of a travelling Greenlandic tribe. So primitive was their  lifestyle that the men ate from a fresh corpse of an animal, while she at  ripe old age of six still suckled her mother's breast for milk. Now an  adult she lives in antagonism with her emotions, and as much as she longs  for Greenland, that is how much she despises her American father(Jack  Warner) and his pathetic young wife(younger then she is) with whom she has  an ugly almost violent relationship. I was surprised by Ormond's  performance, unlike her other roles where her wholesome beauty was her  biggest assest, here sporting jet black her, a Scandinavian accent and a  rough demeanor, she is even more attractive.One person does  eventually break through to her, a meek Greenlandic boy who lives  downstairs from her. The film's starts with the boy falling off their  building's roof to his death. But on examining the ice track's on the  roof(in one the film's several hints at the super-natural) she uses what  the title refers to as her &quot;sense of snow&quot; along with her skills  as a mathmatician to conclude that this was no accident. On the scene there  is another neighbor The Mechanic(Gabriel Byrne) who also claims to have  known and loved the deceased. Byrne's performance is less impressive  because the plot requires his character's motivations to remain ambiguous.The film then turns into a police procedural spearheaded by Ormond  and resisted by omniscient villains who finally drive events to their  ludicrous climax in Greenland. Even within the limitations of its  unraveling plot which in the end amounts to nothing but silliness, the film  wastes acting legend Richard Harris in a role where he has all of 5  lines.I recognise that an enigma will always be more intriguing then  any solution, no matter how carefully pieced together. That a silent stoic  moron could be more interseting then a blabbermouth with a 170 IQ. I don't  expect all thrillers to have the kind of payoff Se7en or The Usual Suspects  had. But Smilla's Sense Of Snow is finally a frustrating experience because  in its atmosphere, its sense of time and place and in Ormond's performance  it is sometimes a great film, but then for a final 30 minutes of  astonishing idiocy it systematically undoes itself. For every step director  Augest takes forward with some uncommonly good character development, the  ludicrous plot takes a step back. I almost want to spoil the film for those  who haven't seen it, just so they can concentrate on what this film is good  at. Intersting charcacters within an intoxicating atmosphere.In one  scene Smilla compares her love of Mathematics to a receding horizon. No  matter how close you think you are to the truth, the horizon will recede  and provide endless possibilities. Intially Smilla's Sense of Snow is  similarly intriguing, like travelling through a desert and pondering  weather that faraway image is a mirage or a lake. Then August goes and  spoils it all by taking you to that image and shooting unambiguous sand for  thirty minutes.",3,The Receding Horizon,967852800,"09 2, 2000",2000,3933,"['Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'mirage', 'movie', 'janitor', 'designer', 'clothes', 'clown', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'cloak', 'promising', 'foreboding', 'journey', 'self-loathing', 'murderous', 'corruption', 'dark', 'racial', 'undertones', 'So', 'when', 'film', 'beautifully', 'embroidered', 'chest', 'quot', 'BOO', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'severe', 'lack', 'complacency.Julia', 'Ormond', 'stars', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'half', 'American', 'half', 'Greenlandic', 'loner', 'living', 'rather', 'downscale', 'neighborhood', 'Copenhagen', 'purposes', 'film', 'Copenhagen', 'painted', 'desolate', 'icy', 'unfeeling', 'place', 'testament', 'morbidity', 'Smilla', 'life', 'grim', 'metropolis', 'betrayal', 'origins', 'even', 'icier', 'crueler', 'primitive', 'Greenland', 'film', 'complex', 'structure', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'where', 'was', 'part', 'travelling', 'Greenlandic', 'tribe', 'So', 'primitive', 'was', 'lifestyle', 'men', 'ate', 'fresh', 'corpse', 'animal', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', 'six', 'still', 'suckled', 'mother', 'breast', 'milk', 'Now', 'adult', 'antagonism', 'emotions', 'as', 'much', 'Greenland', 'how', 'much', 'American', 'father', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'pathetic', 'young', 'wife', 'younger', 'then', 'whom', 'ugly', 'almost', 'violent', 'relationship', 'was', 'surprised', 'Ormond', 'performance', 'other', 'roles', 'where', 'wholesome', 'beauty', 'was', 'biggest', 'assest', 'here', 'sporting', 'jet', 'black', 'her', 'Scandinavian', 'accent', 'rough', 'demeanor', 'even', 'more', 'attractive.One', 'person', 'eventually', 'break', 'meek', 'Greenlandic', 'boy', 'who', 'downstairs', 'film', 'starts', 'boy', 'falling', 'off', 'building', 'roof', 'death', 'examining', 'ice', 'track', 'roof', 'one', 'film', 'several', 'hints', 'super-natural', 'what', 'title', 'refers', 'quot', 'sense', 'snow', 'quot', 'skills', 'mathmatician', 'conclude', 'was', 'accident', 'scene', 'neighbor', 'Mechanic', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'known', 'loved', 'deceased', 'Byrne', 'performance', 'less', 'impressive', 'plot', 'character', 'motivations', 'remain', 'ambiguous.The', 'film', 'then', 'police', 'procedural', 'spearheaded', 'Ormond', 'resisted', 'omniscient', 'villains', 'who', 'finally', 'drive', 'events', 'ludicrous', 'climax', 'Greenland', 'Even', 'limitations', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'end', 'nothing', 'silliness', 'film', 'acting', 'legend', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'role', 'where', '5', 'lines.I', 'recognise', 'enigma', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'more', 'intriguing', 'then', 'solution', 'matter', 'how', 'carefully', 'pieced', 'together', 'silent', 'stoic', 'moron', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'interseting', 'then', 'blabbermouth', '170', 'IQ', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'thrillers', 'have', 'kind', 'payoff', 'Se7en', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'had', 'Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'finally', 'frustrating', 'experience', 'atmosphere', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'Ormond', 'performance', 'sometimes', 'great', 'film', 'then', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'astonishing', 'idiocy', 'systematically', 'step', 'director', 'Augest', 'forward', 'uncommonly', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'step', 'back', 'almost', 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'just', 'can', 'concentrate', 'what', 'film', 'good', 'Intersting', 'charcacters', 'intoxicating', 'atmosphere.In', 'one', 'scene', 'Smilla', 'love', 'Mathematics', 'receding', 'horizon', 'matter', 'how', 'close', 'think', 'are', 'truth', 'horizon', 'will', 'recede', 'provide', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'Intially', 'Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'similarly', 'intriguing', 'travelling', 'desert', 'pondering', 'weather', 'faraway', 'image', 'mirage', 'lake', 'Then', 'August', 'taking', 'image', 'shooting', 'unambiguous', 'sand', 'thirty', 'minutes']",N/A

And I'm glad they chose a Scandinavian director to translate it to the screen; I'm not sure others could have captured the cold physical and emotional landscape that is so crucial to this story.

159762,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0793941806,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","I hadn't even read the book (which I had saved for a snowy weekend) when I picked up the movie version of &quot;Ms. Smilla's Feeling for Snow&quot;.  Don't ask me to spell out Smilla's first name in full, nobody asks the director's either, just indicative of the neglect that the filmaker's give their star charachter.  This only enlarges the biggest gap in the novel: &quot;Smilla&quot; is a mystery with X-files-style paranormal overtones, yet no mystery author Peter Hoeg offered matched the one posed by Smilla herself.  With her tightly bound prejudices and hatreds, Smilla is practically her own whodunit, comprising all of the charachters who you'll meet in any given mystery - being her own intrepid investigator, the official detective assigned to the case, any one of a dozen of the usual suspects, the murderer and the victim.  One suspects she'll morph into Keyser Soze if given the opportunity.  The ingredients of Hoeg's actual mystery pale by comparison and Smilla's baggage seems to block any of Hoeg's efforts to get the real mystery going.In this case, the mystery involves the death of Isaiah, a young inuit boy who lives in Smilla's apartment block in Copenhagen.  The inuits approximate to Danes what the Native American's are to modern America - separated from their spiritual roots in the Earth, their modern trappings give way to alcoholim, welfare dependency and despair.  Smilla, whose animosity derives from this detachment, had become Isaiah's surrogate mother.  That there is any myserty at all seems at first to arise from Smilla's compulsive suspicion.  A few key coincidences, the meetings of recurring charachters who shouldn't have anything to do with each other, the Danish police's stiffening insistence that Smilla drop her own investigation, death threats, exploding boats and a large corporation's interest in a meteorite that landed in Greenland over a century ago - all gradually convince us that something is afoot, but nothing gels together to surmount what remains the mystry of both book and film: Smilla herself.The film's makers, free from the first person narrative of the book actually make Smilla a greater enigma than Hoeg had.  They keep the details light but - while preferable to a heavier hand - don't create a myserty one wants to solve.  Like the mystery, the flaws of the film are based on numerous small details that only harm in the aggregate.  The lovely Julia Ormond seems too young to play the 37 year-old Smilla, giving no hint to the heroines rotracted history, one that would have her as a radical college student in Denmark's turbulent 1960's.  Similarly, Gabriel Byrne seems too dark and myserious to play the Mechanic who was only supposed to arouse suspicion in the book.  Then there are the villaisn, the mining company that employed the victim's late father.  After effectively burying the truth, and not a few of those who threatened them, the multinational corporate evil allows itself to fall apart on a Greenlandic glacier, suddenly lacking even a shred of power or menace.  Even their capacity for secrecy is gone - with the usual standby clues (the informer who tells all out of conscience; the evil scientist who just has to spill teh beans knowing that the hero will just die anyway) jettisoned in favor of a single videotape prepared, it seems, just for the hero to find.  As in the book, the climax fails to satisfy and leaves the film with an empty feeling.",3,A painful botch I just can't refuse,978220800,"12 31, 2000",2000,3440,"['had', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'saved', 'snowy', 'weekend', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'version', 'quot', 'Ms.', 'Smilla', 'Feeling', 'Snow', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'spell', 'out', 'Smilla', 'first', 'name', 'full', 'nobody', 'director', 'just', 'indicative', 'neglect', 'filmaker', 'give', 'star', 'charachter', 'only', 'biggest', 'gap', 'novel', 'quot', 'Smilla', 'quot', 'mystery', 'X-files-style', 'paranormal', 'overtones', 'yet', 'mystery', 'author', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'offered', 'matched', 'one', 'posed', 'Smilla', 'tightly', 'bound', 'prejudices', 'hatreds', 'Smilla', 'practically', 'own', 'whodunit', 'comprising', 'charachters', 'who', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'given', 'mystery', 'being', 'own', 'intrepid', 'investigator', 'official', 'detective', 'assigned', 'case', 'one', 'dozen', 'usual', 'suspects', 'murderer', 'victim', 'One', ""'ll"", 'morph', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'given', 'opportunity', 'ingredients', 'Hoeg', 'actual', 'mystery', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Smilla', 'baggage', 'block', 'Hoeg', 'efforts', 'get', 'real', 'mystery', 'going.In', 'case', 'mystery', 'death', 'Isaiah', 'young', 'inuit', 'boy', 'who', 'Smilla', 'apartment', 'block', 'Copenhagen', 'inuits', 'approximate', 'Danes', 'what', 'Native', 'American', 'are', 'modern', 'America', 'separated', 'spiritual', 'roots', 'Earth', 'modern', 'trappings', 'give', 'way', 'alcoholim', 'welfare', 'dependency', 'despair', 'Smilla', 'animosity', 'detachment', 'had', 'become', 'Isaiah', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'myserty', 'first', 'arise', 'Smilla', 'compulsive', 'suspicion', 'few', 'key', 'coincidences', 'meetings', 'recurring', 'charachters', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'other', 'Danish', 'police', 'stiffening', 'insistence', 'Smilla', 'drop', 'own', 'investigation', 'death', 'threats', 'exploding', 'boats', 'large', 'corporation', 'interest', 'meteorite', 'landed', 'Greenland', 'century', 'gradually', 'convince', 'something', 'afoot', 'nothing', 'gels', 'together', 'surmount', 'what', 'mystry', 'book', 'film', 'Smilla', 'herself.The', 'film', 'makers', 'free', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'book', 'actually', 'make', 'Smilla', 'greater', 'enigma', 'Hoeg', 'had', 'keep', 'details', 'light', 'preferable', 'heavier', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'myserty', 'one', 'solve', 'mystery', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'based', 'numerous', 'small', 'details', 'only', 'harm', 'aggregate', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'too', 'young', 'play', '37', 'year-old', 'Smilla', 'giving', 'hint', 'heroines', 'rotracted', 'history', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'radical', 'college', 'student', 'Denmark', 'turbulent', '1960', 'Similarly', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'too', 'dark', 'myserious', 'play', 'Mechanic', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'supposed', 'arouse', 'suspicion', 'book', 'Then', 'are', 'villaisn', 'mining', 'company', 'employed', 'victim', 'late', 'father', 'effectively', 'burying', 'truth', 'not', 'few', 'who', 'threatened', 'multinational', 'corporate', 'evil', 'fall', 'apart', 'Greenlandic', 'glacier', 'suddenly', 'lacking', 'even', 'shred', 'power', 'menace', 'Even', 'capacity', 'secrecy', 'gone', 'usual', 'standby', 'clues', 'informer', 'who', 'conscience', 'evil', 'scientist', 'who', 'just', 'spill', 'teh', 'beans', 'knowing', 'hero', 'will', 'just', 'die', 'anyway', 'jettisoned', 'favor', 'single', 'videotape', 'prepared', 'just', 'hero', 'find', 'book', 'climax', 'satisfy', 'film', 'empty', 'feeling']",N/A

159766,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0793941806,Themis-Athena,"[40, 41]","How many words for ""snow"" do you know?  In most languages, there is only one ... or maybe a few, but not many different ones.  But the Inuit language knows countless words for snow - different expressions based on its consistency, its aggregate state, on whether it's old or freshly fallen, and much, much more.  And snow is Smilla Jaspersen's specialty; it's what she studies and what she knows better than anybody and anything.  So when her only friend, an Inuit boy living in the same Copenhagen apartment complex as her is found dead on the pavement in front of their house, she knows something must be amiss; he can't have fallen off the roof, as the police quickly conclude:  afraid of heights, he would not have climbed to the roof if not driven there in the first place, and he certainly wouldn't have run to the edge ... as his footsteps in the otherwise untouched snow cover on the roof, however, indicate.Smilla, half Inuit herself and brought to Copenhagen against her will after her Inuit mother's death, is a loner, a rebel against society, hiding her fears and loneliness under a thick coat of armor of unapproachability and trying to be ""rough all over.""  Unable and unwilling to ever lift that coat of armor, she takes refuge in science - her definition of longing are mathematics's negative numbers, the ""formalization of the feeling that you're missing something."" - Yet, this movie's Smilla is not the Smilla Jaspersen of Peter Hoeg's novel which the movie seeks to adapt ... although Julia Ormond's performance is not exactly coated with sugar, she is a far cry from the book's 37-year old woman who hates her Danish father for tearing her from her Greenlandic roots and open skies, and who hates the confines of the society in which he has made her grow up.And as the story's protagonist changes in the movie adaption, so does the story line itself - unfortunately, not for the better.  Even accepting that it would have been impossible to translate all the novel's subplots and subtleties onto the screen, what begins like a complex, introspective story about loneliness, the loss of home, and the unchecked power and ambition of a group of prestigious scientists, turns into your average thriller in the end - a huge let-down in an otherwise compelling movie.Nevertheless, Ormond's performance as Bille August's Smilla (even if not Peter Hoeg's) is strong; and so, in all its quietness, is Gabriel Byrne's performance as Smilla's neighbor, the would-be mechanic.  Atmospherically, the movie wonderfully projects Smilla's loneliness in the sad, gray skies and wet snow of wintry Copenhagen, as opposed to the crisp blue skies, white ice fields and limitless horizons of Greenland.  For these reasons alone, the movie is well worth watching; even if those of us who have read the novel will have to leave aside a good portion of its contents to be able to appreciate the movie on its own merits.Also recommended:Smilla's Sense of SnowTales of the Night (Harvill Panther)The Shipping NewsFargo (Special Edition)",4,"Wintry skies, loneliness and a little boy's mysterious death",1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,3032,"['How', 'many', 'words', 'snow', 'do', 'know', 'most', 'languages', 'only', 'one', 'maybe', 'few', 'not', 'many', 'different', 'ones', 'Inuit', 'language', 'countless', 'words', 'snow', 'different', 'expressions', 'based', 'consistency', 'aggregate', 'state', 'old', 'freshly', 'fallen', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'snow', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'specialty', 'what', 'studies', 'what', 'better', 'anybody', 'anything', 'So', 'when', 'only', 'friend', 'Inuit', 'boy', 'living', 'same', 'Copenhagen', 'apartment', 'complex', 'found', 'dead', 'pavement', 'front', 'house', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'amiss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'fallen', 'off', 'roof', 'police', 'quickly', 'conclude', 'afraid', 'heights', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'climbed', 'roof', 'not', 'driven', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'run', 'edge', 'footsteps', 'otherwise', 'untouched', 'snow', 'cover', 'roof', 'however', 'indicate.Smilla', 'half', 'Inuit', 'brought', 'Copenhagen', 'will', 'Inuit', 'mother', 'death', 'loner', 'rebel', 'society', 'hiding', 'fears', 'loneliness', 'thick', 'coat', 'armor', 'unapproachability', 'trying', 'be', 'rough', 'over', 'Unable', 'unwilling', 'ever', 'lift', 'coat', 'armor', 'refuge', 'science', 'definition', 'longing', 'are', 'mathematics', 'negative', 'numbers', 'formalization', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something', 'Yet', 'movie', 'Smilla', 'not', 'Smilla', 'Jaspersen', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'novel', 'movie', 'adapt', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'performance', 'not', 'exactly', 'coated', 'sugar', 'far', 'cry', 'book', '37-year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'Danish', 'father', 'tearing', 'Greenlandic', 'roots', 'open', 'skies', 'who', 'confines', 'society', 'made', 'grow', 'up.And', 'story', 'protagonist', 'changes', 'movie', 'adaption', 'so', 'story', 'line', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'better', 'Even', 'accepting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'translate', 'novel', 'subplots', 'subtleties', 'screen', 'what', 'complex', 'introspective', 'story', 'loneliness', 'loss', 'home', 'unchecked', 'power', 'ambition', 'group', 'prestigious', 'scientists', 'average', 'thriller', 'end', 'huge', 'let-down', 'otherwise', 'compelling', 'movie.Nevertheless', 'Ormond', 'performance', 'Bille', 'August', 'Smilla', 'even', 'not', 'Peter', 'Hoeg', 'strong', 'so', 'quietness', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'performance', 'Smilla', 'neighbor', 'would-be', 'mechanic', 'Atmospherically', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'projects', 'Smilla', 'loneliness', 'sad', 'gray', 'skies', 'wet', 'snow', 'wintry', 'Copenhagen', 'opposed', 'crisp', 'blue', 'skies', 'white', 'ice', 'fields', 'limitless', 'horizons', 'Greenland', 'reasons', 'alone', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'have', 'leave', 'aside', 'good', 'portion', 'contents', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'own', 'merits.Also', 'recommended', 'Smilla', 'Sense', 'SnowTales', 'Night', 'Harvill', 'Panther', 'Shipping', 'NewsFargo', 'Special', 'Edition']",N/A

HOWEVER, I FEEL THAT SMILLA SUCCEEDS. SURE, YOU COULD LEVEL KNEEJERK CRITICISMS THAT JULIA ORMANDE IS  TOO PRETTY FOR THE ROLE, AND THAT YOUR FAVORITE PARTS OF THE NOVEL ARE  GONE, BUT, I ACTUALLY LIKED THE CLEAN-UP JOB THAT WAS DONE. THE STORY IS  STREAMLINED TO WORK AS A FEATURE FILM. I WAS WARY OF JULIA ORMANDE AS  SMILLA BUT I THINK SHE'S SUBTLE AND FANTASTIC. I SEE NUANCES WITH EACH  VIEWING. THE SET-PIECES ARE IMPRESSIVE, THE SMALL MOMENTS EXQUISITE, AND  THE QUIRKS RETAINED IN SMILLA'S PERSONALITY ARE EXTREMELY REFRESHING, SUCH  AS HER DEPRESSION, HER NOT-AT-ALL-CUTESY ATTACHMENT TO THE BOY, AND ESP.,  IN MY OPINION, THE PART OF THE NOVEL I THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER KEEP, WHERE SHE  CONFRONTS HER FATHER'S BRATTY MISTRESS BY... OWCH! WELL, THAT WOULD BE  TELLING... WHOOOOH... MIND YOU, IT'S ULTIMATELY AN IMCOMPLETE VIEWING  EXPERIENCE; WHAT IS THERE IS GREAT, WHAT ISN'T LEAVES A BIT OF A VACUUM.

159769,A14D63XS7C1GN,0793941806,W. Wilkinson,"[5, 5]","Smilla's Sense of Snow was released to theaters in America sometime in 1995, I believe.  And if my memory serves me as well as I think it does, I think its trailer was attached to the movie Clueless, which we saw in the theater (the trailer for Empire Records was attached, too).The trailer seemed moody and dark, even though snow was featured prominently throughout, but both my sister and I were somehow, and for some reason, fixated on this upcoming movie.  But as soon as we got home we could NOT remember the name of the movie for the lives of us.  And the movie was not a big hit because I don't even remember seeing a trailer for it on TV.Years would go by and we would always ask people about this weird movie that took place somwhere where there's a lot of snow, and this strange movie where ... they were investigating some kid that fell off a roof.  It was just so CRAZY how the images of this trailer haunted us for years!  But we couldn't remember the title or the name of the actress that starred in it.Sometime in 2003, I was flipping through the channels on TV one day and stopped at the Bravo channel ... and suddenly it hit me!  That weird movie was playing right before my eyes!  It was called Smilla's Sense of Snow!  I didn't even have to think twice about it, which is really odd because the scene that was currently playing on TV took place on some boat, not outside in the snow at all, like in the trailer.  It was just so weird!  My sister wasn't at home, but I called her cell phone immediately and told her I finally knew what that movie was, and she instantly knew which one I was referring to!Not long after we were in Best Buy, and we came across the DVD, which was on sale for 5 bucks.  I wasted NO time buying it immediately!And today I love it, and it's one of my favorites.  And I think this is how I got fixated on snow/water in movies!Julia Ormond, Gabriel Byrne, Vanessa Redgrave, and everyone else in the movie are fantastic, though towards the end the plot gets a little far-fetched.  But that's okay!  I can handle a little far-fetchedness!",5,Weird memories ...,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2080,"['Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'America', 'sometime', '1995', 'believe', 'memory', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'think', 'trailer', 'was', 'attached', 'movie', 'Clueless', 'saw', 'theater', 'trailer', 'Empire', 'Records', 'was', 'attached', 'too', '.The', 'trailer', 'seemed', 'moody', 'dark', 'even', 'snow', 'was', 'featured', 'prominently', 'sister', 'were', 'somehow', 'reason', 'fixated', 'upcoming', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'home', 'could', 'NOT', 'remember', 'name', 'movie', 'lives', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'TV.Years', 'would', 'go', 'would', 'always', 'ask', 'people', 'weird', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'somwhere', 'where', 'lot', 'snow', 'strange', 'movie', 'where', 'were', 'investigating', 'kid', 'fell', 'off', 'roof', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'CRAZY', 'how', 'images', 'trailer', 'haunted', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'title', 'name', 'actress', 'starred', 'it.Sometime', '2003', 'was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'TV', 'one', 'day', 'stopped', 'Bravo', 'channel', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'weird', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'right', 'eyes', 'was', 'called', 'Smilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'think', 'twice', 'really', 'odd', 'scene', 'was', 'currently', 'playing', 'TV', 'took', 'place', 'boat', 'not', 'snow', 'trailer', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'weird', 'sister', 'was', ""n't"", 'home', 'called', 'cell', 'phone', 'immediately', 'told', 'finally', 'knew', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'instantly', 'knew', 'one', 'was', 'referring', 'Not', 'long', 'were', 'Best', 'Buy', 'came', 'DVD', 'was', 'sale', '5', 'bucks', 'wasted', 'time', 'buying', 'immediately', 'today', 'love', 'one', 'favorites', 'think', 'how', 'got', 'fixated', 'snow/water', 'movies', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'are', 'fantastic', 'end', 'plot', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'okay', 'can', 'handle', 'little', 'far-fetchedness']",N/A
