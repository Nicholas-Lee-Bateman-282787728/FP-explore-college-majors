502437,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00000IBN2,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[34, 37]","What I like about Richard Simmons videos is that he dares to use ""real music"", music that is recognizable, and fun.  Sure it isn't the original singers, but these tunes are done well.  Richard's group is happy, very happy, very very happy.  You can't help appreciate that and it is contagious.  The sets change as well as the front-line exercisers.Now, I don't generally use his videos because I feel they are geared for more overweight people and I use more challenging aerobic videos.  But I got off the wagon recently and decided to get back into exercising and chose Richard Simmons to get me back in the mood.What I don't like about his videos is that he constantly changes steps.  Constantly.  I prefer to stick with a step at least 6-8 times, but he changes after almost 2 times.  I don't care for that, as it causes me to get off track and just move anyway til I catch up again.Otherwise, it is a fun workout!  Rizzo",4,Contagiously  happy people!

502438,AULQIHY8RTYNS,B00000IBN2,Customer,"[6, 6]","I just wanted to write this review in response to a couple of reviews listed earlier.He does have overweight people in this video, and people of all shapes and sizes. I don't see anything wrong with having a few 'skinny' people, as there are skinny people out there too who need to exercise. As a matter of fact, there are more overweight people in this video than skinny people, and he does dance next to overweight people in this video.As far as leaving this video to just the skinny people because the Sweatin' videos are better, well, I bet you didn't get the Sweatin' videos on the first try perfectly, did you? It takes some practice to get the moves down, for sure, and you won't  get everything the first try. This is a low impact aerobics video perfect for overweight people who want a little 'spice' to their workouts.I am 60lbs overweight and 5ft4, and I did this video just fine. It might not be for everyone and that's fine too.But there are a lot of moves similar to the ones in the Sweatin' videos, and some similar routines. So if you are an avid user of the Sweatin' videos you should catch on to this one.This one is brilliant. I love the music; I do this video just because Richard's personality is infectious and the music is fantastic. You stretch to 'Sweet Dreams', and do aerobics to 'Congo', and 'All Night Long' to name a few.This video is for everyone. It is not just for skinny people. Overweight folks should have no problem getting through this video.",5,fun workout!,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1480,"['just', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'response', 'couple', 'reviews', 'listed', 'earlier.He', 'have', 'overweight', 'people', 'video', 'people', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'having', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'skinny', 'people', 'there', 'too', 'who', 'need', 'exercise', 'matter', 'fact', 'are', 'more', 'overweight', 'people', 'video', 'skinny', 'people', 'dance', 'next', 'overweight', 'people', 'video.As', 'far', 'leaving', 'video', 'just', 'skinny', 'people', 'Sweatin', 'videos', 'are', 'better', 'well', 'bet', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Sweatin', 'videos', 'first', 'try', 'perfectly', 'did', 'practice', 'get', 'moves', 'down', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'everything', 'first', 'try', 'low', 'impact', 'aerobics', 'video', 'perfect', 'overweight', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'little', ""'spice"", 'workouts.I', 'am', '60lbs', 'overweight', '5ft4', 'did', 'video', 'just', 'fine', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'fine', 'too.But', 'are', 'lot', 'moves', 'similar', 'ones', 'Sweatin', 'videos', 'similar', 'routines', 'So', 'are', 'avid', 'user', 'Sweatin', 'videos', 'should', 'catch', 'one.This', 'one', 'brilliant', 'love', 'music', 'do', 'video', 'just', 'Richard', 'personality', 'infectious', 'music', 'fantastic', 'stretch', ""'Sweet"", 'Dreams', 'do', 'aerobics', ""'Congo"", 'Night', 'Long', 'name', 'few.This', 'video', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'skinny', 'people', 'Overweight', 'folks', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'video']",Richard Simmons Dance Your Pants Off!

His routines take a  little time to learn, but once you have them down, they're fun! This  routine is arguably both his toughest and the most fun to do. It's shorter  than most of his other aerobic tapes (only 27 minutes aerobic), but the  music is fun, the routines are a blast, and Richard's enthusiasm keeps you  going. If you like 80's classics, you'll like the music for sure.

Richard and his team are so fully of energy in this, it just makes you smile...while you're working out! Who does that, right?  It's a great aerobic workout and the 50 or so minutes goes by pretty quickly because you don't spend your time watching the clock, but instead watching the guys and gals on screen who seem to be having a blast.My only complaint is that there isn't a DVD copy of this available.I highly recommend this for all levels of fitness.  Beginners can start out just doing the movements...and then add more intensity as you get the hang of it.  But this tape is fantastic for those of us who have been doing aerobics for years as well.  Richard knows how to make a work out more than just something you have to force yourself through.  Sure, it's a little cheesy at times, but that's part of the fun.  And in this day and age, we need all the fun we can find.Buy it!",5,A workout made fun!,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,925,"['Easily', 'favorite', 'workout', 'video', 'ever', 'Richard', 'team', 'are', 'so', 'fully', 'energy', 'just', 'smile', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'Who', 'right', 'great', 'aerobic', 'workout', '50', 'so', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'clock', 'instead', 'watching', 'guys', 'gals', 'screen', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'blast.My', 'only', 'complaint', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'copy', 'available.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'levels', 'fitness', 'Beginners', 'can', 'start', 'out', 'just', 'doing', 'movements', 'then', 'add', 'more', 'intensity', 'get', 'hang', 'tape', 'fantastic', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'aerobics', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'how', 'make', 'work', 'out', 'more', 'just', 'something', 'have', 'force', 'Sure', 'little', 'cheesy', 'times', 'part', 'fun', 'day', 'age', 'need', 'fun', 'can', 'find.Buy']",Richard Simmons Dance Your Pants Off!
