However, the Rifftrax guys did an excellent job poking fun of what old time movie goers might have thought of as quality entertainment. In the case of this film, the quality entertainment is the Rifftrax boys!! I watched this with some friends and we all howled with laughter the whole way through-5 stars all the way!",5,Creepy and funny!!,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,426,"['Carnival', 'Souls', 'strange', 'creepy', 'top', 'film', 'Probably', 'not', 'best', 'will', 'see', 'However', 'Rifftrax', 'guys', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'poking', 'fun', 'what', 'old', 'time', 'movie', 'goers', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'case', 'film', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'Rifftrax', 'watched', 'friends', 'howled', 'laughter', 'whole', 'way', 'through-5', 'stars', 'way']",RiffTrax: Carnival of Souls - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!
1251644,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B0026KJP6C,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[2, 2]","While in a car with two friends, some young men drag race with them, drive onto a bridge and the car with the girls gets sent over the side into the river below. A bit later while people are trying to find the submerged car, one of the young women named Mary comes out of the water and can't seem to remember what happened. So after barely any time grieving she decides to take her organ playing ability to Utah where she can make a new life, she shacks up in a house where a creepy, drunk guy across the hall keeps hitting on her, the priest that feels her type of organ playing is evil and Mary herself just looks blank as ever no matter what the scene calls for.Oh and there's a mysterious, creepy and shut down carnival that Mary seems drawn to for some reason that she doesn't understand, oh by the way Mary also keeps seeing some scary guy in drab make-up that seems to want something from her, but what? This is honestly not a terrible movie, there's some atmosphere to it, sadly the acting is pretty bland but Candace Hilligoss as Mary is on a whole new level of bland and bad.I did throughly enjoy the Rifftrax crew's take on this flick, they do get off some fantastic lines especially directed at Mary, the constant organ music, Kevin Murphy's password line during the department store sequence was one of the best to me. There is some dead space, which is expected given the lack of dialogue in parts of the film, the riffs do stay at a good pace for the most part. Its not the best riffing they've ever done but its in the top half of the DVD's they released in my opinion. I was laughing more often than I wasn't thats for sure.",5,"Carnival of laughter, plenty of laughter....",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,1641,"['car', 'two', 'friends', 'young', 'men', 'drag', 'race', 'drive', 'bridge', 'car', 'girls', 'sent', 'side', 'river', 'bit', 'later', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'submerged', 'car', 'one', 'young', 'women', 'named', 'Mary', 'water', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'So', 'barely', 'time', 'grieving', 'take', 'organ', 'playing', 'ability', 'Utah', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'up', 'house', 'where', 'creepy', 'drunk', 'guy', 'hall', 'hitting', 'priest', 'type', 'organ', 'playing', 'evil', 'Mary', 'just', 'blank', 'ever', 'matter', 'what', 'scene', 'for.Oh', 'mysterious', 'creepy', 'shut', 'down', 'carnival', 'Mary', 'drawn', 'reason', ""n't"", 'understand', 'oh', 'way', 'Mary', 'also', 'seeing', 'scary', 'guy', 'drab', 'make-up', 'want', 'something', 'what', 'honestly', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'sadly', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bland', 'Candace', 'Hilligoss', 'Mary', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'bland', 'bad.I', 'did', 'throughly', 'enjoy', 'Rifftrax', 'crew', 'take', 'flick', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'fantastic', 'lines', 'especially', 'directed', 'Mary', 'constant', 'organ', 'music', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'password', 'line', 'department', 'store', 'sequence', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'dead', 'space', 'expected', 'given', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'parts', 'film', 'riffs', 'do', 'stay', 'good', 'pace', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'best', 'riffing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'top', 'half', 'DVD', 'released', 'opinion', 'was', 'laughing', 'more', 'often', 'was', ""n't"", 'thats', 'sure']",RiffTrax: Carnival of Souls - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!

1251646,A1BFPW6FP0DPNF,B0026KJP6C,Petite Fleur,"[0, 1]","""Carnival of Souls"" is a very low-budget, black and white movie.  The problem with Riffing this movie is that the movie itself has very little dialogue.  The guys had to work harder to fill in that much dead space and often they just didn't say anything.  To be fair, there are a few hilarious comments, but just not enough humorous quips to keep it going.  The movie has some good spooky, original moments.  There are many things that aren't explained.  We never know why the dumb woman keeps going to the Carnival, unless we're to make assumptions of what it's supposed to represent.  The ending is no shock to anyone unless they missed the first 15 minutes.",3,"Entertaining, but too much Dead Space",1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,660,"['Carnival', 'Souls', 'very', 'low-budget', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'problem', 'Riffing', 'movie', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'guys', 'had', 'work', 'harder', 'fill', 'much', 'dead', 'space', 'often', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'few', 'hilarious', 'comments', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'humorous', 'quips', 'keep', 'going', 'movie', 'good', 'spooky', 'original', 'moments', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'dumb', 'woman', 'going', 'Carnival', ""'re"", 'make', 'assumptions', 'what', 'supposed', 'represent', 'ending', 'shock', 'anyone', 'missed', 'first', '15', 'minutes']",RiffTrax: Carnival of Souls - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000!
