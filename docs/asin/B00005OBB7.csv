Although the history stuff is mostly of the Ant leaves Genesis/Phil joins Genesis/Steve joins Genesis/Peter leaves Genesis kind, what actually lets this DVD down is the woefully inadequate concert footage. Most clips of performances are literally a few seconds in length, but even more disappointing is that some of their most notable songs, in particular Suppers Ready, barely get a mention at all, let alone comprehensive coverage with vintage footage. No wonder Genesis remain a video and audio bootleggers goldmine...Maybe I'm being too ""old school"", and fail to realize that many people who bought the later records have never even heard Trespass or Foxtrot. If so, I'm sorry. However, I thought the reason for liking Genesis was all about the music.

672258,A2CHLPRJZSD6U9,B00005OBB7,"Mr. S. St Thomas ""suckerfly""","[24, 24]","This seems such a wasted opportunity.I think what's become inherent in the music industry, is that it has forgotten that the world is a 'conceptual marketplace'. And in that fact, there are many different types of buyers out there. In an effort to please a wide majority, the bare minimum of effort is taken to present a product that can satisfy a wider market. The truth of it is, the music industry assumes there are more than three types of fans, and aims for the one who will buy in greater numbers.Fan 1) Just likes the greatest hits. Sees the band in concert if they're in town. Probably owns none of the band's albums 'proper' but likes them for what they know.Fan 2) May own a few CD's or albums by the band, but may be interested in knowing more about them. May not have the money or time to invest in a full catalogue encounter, but is interested should there be a more comprehensive study.Fan 3) The super fan, who must see and own everything.These may be generic facsimilies of consumers, but they typify what is in the world, what is in that conceptual marketplace, and with technology growing to satisfy a larger number of consumers on cheaper modes of media with more storage, it would seem that all three of these consumers could be satisfied. Unfortunately, the industry underestimates the marketplace, and just tries to break even on its returns.The wasted opportunity here is that Fan No. 3 gets footage of The Fountain of Samalcis, Supper's Ready, The Musical Box, IN The Cage, etc. all in pristine form for their time, but only for 30 seconds each. And there's plenty of room on this DVD to fit all of these performances, in full.Fan No.2 doesn't see enough of the older footage to make their mind up whether they'd like to see more. 30 seconds is good for an A &amp; R representative to decide whether you get a recording contact or not. They get paid to do that. You as a consumer, deserve more.Fan No.1 gets just what they want, no more no less. If they make it through Steve Hackett's ''Horizons'', I would be surprised, and thankful at the same time.There are so many wasted opportunites on this DVD, that I'm not sure who to blame. Not Gabriel, Hackett, Banks, Rutherford and Collins. I'm sure they want you to see performances from the early 70's. I'm sure some of them they're quite proud of and would like to see a permanent and official record of them before they become lost .I recommend you contact Eagle Vision demanding a more 'full-on' approach on the next Genesis project they take on, if they should get the opportunity.",2,The Genesis Songbook,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2558,"['such', 'wasted', 'opportunity.I', 'think', 'what', 'become', 'inherent', 'music', 'industry', 'forgotten', 'world', ""'conceptual"", 'marketplace', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'buyers', 'there', 'effort', 'please', 'wide', 'majority', 'bare', 'minimum', 'effort', 'taken', 'present', 'product', 'can', 'satisfy', 'wider', 'market', 'truth', 'music', 'industry', 'are', 'more', 'three', 'types', 'fans', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'buy', 'greater', 'numbers.Fan', '1', 'Just', 'greatest', 'hits', 'band', 'concert', ""'re"", 'town', 'Probably', 'none', 'band', 'albums', 'what', 'know.Fan', '2', 'May', 'own', 'few', 'CD', 'albums', 'band', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'more', 'May', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'time', 'invest', 'full', 'catalogue', 'encounter', 'interested', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'study.Fan', '3', 'super', 'fan', 'who', 'must', 'see', 'own', 'everything.These', 'may', 'be', 'generic', 'facsimilies', 'consumers', 'typify', 'what', 'world', 'what', 'conceptual', 'marketplace', 'technology', 'growing', 'satisfy', 'larger', 'number', 'consumers', 'cheaper', 'modes', 'media', 'more', 'storage', 'would', 'seem', 'three', 'consumers', 'could', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Unfortunately', 'industry', 'marketplace', 'just', 'tries', 'break', 'even', 'returns.The', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'here', 'Fan', 'No', '3', 'footage', 'Fountain', 'Samalcis', 'Supper', 'Ready', 'Musical', 'Box', 'IN', 'Cage', 'etc', 'pristine', 'form', 'time', 'only', '30', 'seconds', 'plenty', 'room', 'DVD', 'fit', 'performances', 'full.Fan', 'No.2', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'older', 'footage', 'make', 'mind', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', '30', 'seconds', 'good', 'A', 'amp', 'R', 'representative', 'decide', 'get', 'recording', 'contact', 'not', 'get', 'paid', 'do', 'consumer', 'deserve', 'more.Fan', 'No.1', 'just', 'what', 'want', 'more', 'less', 'make', 'Steve', 'Hackett', 'Horizons', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'thankful', 'same', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wasted', 'opportunites', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'blame', 'Not', 'Gabriel', 'Hackett', 'Banks', 'Rutherford', 'Collins', ""'m"", 'sure', 'want', 'see', 'performances', 'early', '70', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'quite', 'proud', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'permanent', 'official', 'record', 'become', 'lost', '.I', 'recommend', 'contact', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'demanding', 'more', ""'full-on"", 'approach', 'next', 'Genesis', 'project', 'take', 'should', 'get', 'opportunity']",N/A
