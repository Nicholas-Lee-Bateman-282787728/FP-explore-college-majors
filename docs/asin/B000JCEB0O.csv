This is a great show loosely based on the books by Walter Farley. Though it pulls details more from the movie than the book (main fact that comes to mind is concerning Alec's father) Still it's a great series, and I will be estatic to finally own it.",5,FINALLY!,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,368,"[""'m"", 'writing', 'DVDs', 'are', 'even', 'released', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'great', 'show', 'loosely', 'based', 'books', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'details', 'more', 'movie', 'book', 'main', 'fact', 'mind', 'concerning', 'Alec', 'father', 'Still', 'great', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'estatic', 'finally', 'own']",The Adventures of The Black Stallion: Season 1

1026219,A3Q1FVG9D6VFPK,B000JCEB0O,"Summer S. Wilson ""Collectonian""","[7, 7]","I was so glad to find out this series has finally been released on DVD (though disappointed the company refused to allowed TVShowsOnDVD to announce it or even list the released on their site).  This is a great show I grew up watching on the Family Channel and I can still remember so many episodes from it.  A great classic for all ages, which is a rarity in this age of nothing but toilet humor and stupid pranks.Despite the lack of features, on the whole this is a great release.  The audio and visual are great.  It has closed captions, though not as a language track so you'll have to activate them with your TV instead.  The embossed cover is really nice.  My only disappointment is that the chapter stops are very meager.  You can only jump from episode to episode rather than scene to scene.  You can't even skip the opening sequence.  While it is a nice song, after 26 episodes it can get tiring.Still, I highly recommend this release as well as the season two set that is out.  I hope they will release season 3 to finish out the series, and maybe follow up with Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop (which aired together with this show and I believe was made by the same company)",5,A Family Classic Finally Hits DVD,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1172,"['was', 'so', 'glad', 'find', 'out', 'series', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'disappointed', 'company', 'refused', 'allowed', 'TVShowsOnDVD', 'announce', 'even', 'list', 'released', 'site', 'great', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Family', 'Channel', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'great', 'classic', 'ages', 'rarity', 'age', 'nothing', 'toilet', 'humor', 'stupid', 'pranks.Despite', 'lack', 'features', 'whole', 'great', 'release', 'audio', 'visual', 'are', 'great', 'closed', 'captions', 'though', 'not', 'language', 'track', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'activate', 'TV', 'instead', 'embossed', 'cover', 'really', 'nice', 'only', 'disappointment', 'chapter', 'stops', 'are', 'very', 'meager', 'can', 'only', 'jump', 'episode', 'episode', 'rather', 'scene', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'skip', 'opening', 'sequence', 'nice', 'song', '26', 'episodes', 'can', 'get', 'tiring.Still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'season', 'two', 'set', 'out', 'hope', 'will', 'release', 'season', '3', 'finish', 'out', 'series', 'maybe', 'follow', 'up', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'K-9', 'Cop', 'aired', 'together', 'show', 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'company']",The Adventures of The Black Stallion: Season 1
