""The Conspiracy"" is one of the better ones. Like ""Lunopolis"" the found footage is interspersed with interviews from ""experts,"" and, disturbingly, real footage from world events we'll all recognize, giving the documentary an authentic feel.  It feels like a documentary.  It's also disturbing and creepy, and feels like a slow burn thriller.The filming was expertly done and the music... WOW!  The music was impressive, especially the music for the ceremony scenes.  I was surprised to read on IMDB that the composer hadn't scored many films. Well, his music captured the mood and character of this film well.The Canucks can mark one in the ""win"" column over this movie.

The synopsis is enough and there are some cameras involved but its not found footage. Seems like lately any film that includes someone video recording something is classified found footage. The documentary makers were very believable and the film conveyed that peeping tom quality, where you feel like you are watching someone's life. The main conflict occurs near the end, though there are some tense scenes prior to it. The beginning leading to the middle is more storytelling and setting up for the big finale. The ending paid off. I can imagine this one with Eurohorror influenced surrealist imagery and camerwork if it had a bigger budget and that would've really rocked.

1655262,ARMUEUP5JKC0U,B00DCRE9LY,"Gigi Fuerte ""Child of the World""","[5, 5]","A few, quick points:- This is one of those movies that lingered on the brain for a few days after viewing. It causes one to consider the movie's conspiracy message as well as to think back on the strategically-placed clues that led to a surprising yet, in hindsight, inevitable climax and conclusion.- One particularly smart element is in the film's second act where the plot appears to devolve into the land of the grossly unrealistic and downright silly. We actually stopped the movie at that point to complain to each other about the characters' nave actions and how, after a strong first act, the movie appeared to be taking a turn for the worse in its second. Boy did we end up being wrong. I like movies with twists and turns, particularly when they are intelligently executed and are wholly unexpected without being absurd. The Conspiracy perfectly delivers on the intelligent/unexpected/appropriate plot twist trick.- A scene toward the end of the movie where the big reveal happens and the viewer begins to see how the puzzle pieces fit together is a particularly creepy one. I happen to enjoy suspense and horror movies somewhat regularly yet the scene in question genuinely gave me the shivers even after the movie had reached its conclusion.- Similar to reviewers Ace and Cidney, I am not a huge fan of mockumentaries but The Conspiracy is an example of the genre done well.- I generally reserve 5 star reviews for movies that have sewn up all of their plot holes or adequately explained all main characters' motivations. The Conspiracy does, in its second act, leave one wondering about the 2 main characters' motivations but this didn't detract too terribly from the viewing experience. The directing, acting, pacing, story, and cinematography are quite good.Ultimately, it is an enjoyable viewing experience and a film with which its crew and actors should be proud to be associated.",4,A Smart Flick,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1898,"['few', 'quick', 'points', 'one', 'movies', 'lingered', 'brain', 'few', 'days', 'viewing', 'one', 'consider', 'movie', 'conspiracy', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'back', 'strategically-placed', 'clues', 'led', 'surprising', 'yet', 'hindsight', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'conclusion.-', 'One', 'particularly', 'smart', 'element', 'film', 'second', 'act', 'where', 'plot', 'devolve', 'land', 'grossly', 'unrealistic', 'downright', 'silly', 'actually', 'stopped', 'movie', 'point', 'complain', 'other', 'characters', 'nave', 'actions', 'how', 'strong', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'appeared', 'be', 'taking', 'turn', 'worse', 'second', 'Boy', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'wrong', 'movies', 'twists', 'turns', 'particularly', 'when', 'are', 'intelligently', 'executed', 'are', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'being', 'absurd', 'Conspiracy', 'perfectly', 'intelligent/unexpected/appropriate', 'plot', 'twist', 'trick.-', 'A', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'big', 'reveal', 'happens', 'viewer', 'see', 'how', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'one', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'suspense', 'horror', 'movies', 'somewhat', 'regularly', 'yet', 'scene', 'question', 'genuinely', 'gave', 'shivers', 'even', 'movie', 'had', 'reached', 'conclusion.-', 'Similar', 'reviewers', 'Ace', 'Cidney', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'mockumentaries', 'Conspiracy', 'example', 'genre', 'done', 'well.-', 'generally', 'reserve', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'movies', 'have', 'sewn', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'adequately', 'explained', 'main', 'characters', 'motivations', 'Conspiracy', 'second', 'act', 'leave', 'one', 'wondering', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'motivations', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'terribly', 'viewing', 'experience', 'directing', 'acting', 'pacing', 'story', 'cinematography', 'are', 'quite', 'good.Ultimately', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'film', 'crew', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'be', 'associated']",Conspiracy
