Turns out I was right as Mark Duplass has been in numerous movies since then, as well as starring in an FX series, ""The League.""Mark Duplass scores again, this time in ""Humpday,"" a type of film project (similar to ""The Puffy Chair"") that employs improvisational, or naturalistic, dialogue.  Films in this genre, sometimes referred to as ""mumblecore,"" are aptly named, since the actors who appear in them often seem incapable of engaging in audible, intelligible dialogue, resorting, instead, to a sort of mumblespeak.Fortunately, no mumble-speak messiness emerges in this film. Besides possessing the ability to communicate effectively, Mark Duplass and Joshua Leonard make improv seem effortless -- almost as though they are acting; paradoxical, isn't it?Despite the implausible premise of the film, it has its genuinely hilarious, as well as dramatic, moments as the two friends (Duplass' and Leonard's characters) try to bring their idea of an unconventional art project to life. Their objective? To enter their ""art"" in the Humpday Festival, an annual event that attracts ""Adult"" content.If the film has one flaw, it is the provocative plot and the turn of events that leads to a rather shallow resolution. This denouement, so to speak, may leave some viewers feeling dissatisfied or let down.

1276064,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002LBKDZ8,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","It's all about expectations, and I had a very different set of expectations going into this film that were turned upside down and made the film a bit better than the film I was expecting.From the trailer and description, I thought this was going to be a movie about two guys trying to make a pornographic film. I was pleasantly surprised to discover this was wrong, in fact there isn't any nudity, and the film is not at all about pornography.Ben is a seemingly normal nice guy newly married to the lovely Anna. One normal middle class night, they are awoken by Ben's college friend, the Bohemian Andrew. Andrew represents the life that Ben secretly still wants no responsibilities; do whatever he wants with whoever he wants whenever he wants. The first half of the film was all about tempting Ben away from a normal middle class married life.This film is full of surprises and discovery. The first half was nicely paced and I could see the conflict Ben was feeling. Andrew was light and breezy; he was a crazy fun mad man from college. As the second act played out, Ben became annoying, overanalyzing everything; and Andrew slipped into a more normal melodramatic character. Anna rose up as a very strong wonderful character, who changed as a result of the dramatic conflict she felt as she uncovered Ben's lies.The part that I find amazing about this film is that there was virtually no script. According to the making of featurette, the actors improvised the entire film. The fact that the film was coherent and played so well dramatically is a big credit to the director and actors. The annoying part of the film was the whole question of will they or won't they? In the very last act, that question was asked way too many times.This is an extremely low budget film. It appears to be a labor of love for the director Lynn Shelton. From my perspective, I think this film was less about relationships with the same gender, but more about being honest and envying what others have.After watching the making of featurettte, it is amazing that this film holds together as well as it does. The production qualities are pretty good.The film is rated R due to the subject matter and strong language. I don't recall any nudity in the film. And there certainly is no violence. For a parent that knows their child well, this film could be viewed by slightly younger viewers than the R rating says.The DVD is full of some excellent special features. I very rarely think that the deleted scenes should be included in the film. However, I think each of those scenes were better than what ended up in the film. The making of featurette is a must watch film. The context of how and why this film was made is excellent.This is not a film for everyone. I enjoyed it very much. If Lynn Shelton had cut out a few of the ""should we"" or ""shouldn't we"" moments and added the deleted scenes, I would have enjoyed the film more.

1276066,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B002LBKDZ8,J. Martin,"[15, 22]","I came here after watching it yesterday to write a review of Humpday, but when I found a few excellent reviews already here I changed my mind. Now I've changed my mind again. Although existing reviews express many of my problems with this movie, they do not adequately cover the most important issue.Although reviewers who liked this movie have correctly noted that it is not about being gay--not even about ""going"" gay--this movie does present a vivid and disturbing picture of most straight men's attitude toward male homosexuality. To them, sex between two men is deeply repugnant, grossly unnatural and disgusting. The prospect of themselves touching another man sexually is so disturbing that they pee in their pants and act like terrified babies. Is that funny? Not to me. Is seeing it enacted brilliantly on screen enlightening and liberating? Not to me. I've seen it all my life.I'm going to assume (because it's almost surely true) that the vast majority of Humpday's ardent fans are women, both straight and lesbian, and probably some straight men who consider themselves liberated and enlightened enough to laugh at the foibles of their less enlightened brothers or even at themselves in their own pre-liberation pasts. I suppose I have to allow also for a few self-loathing gay men, because I know they're out there. I'm going to address this review to those women and straight men; the self-loathing gays I'll pray for.The fact that at least one of the men in Humpday is himself relatively enlightened does not make the movie's offenses any less offensive; it makes them worse, because it also shows how shallow and unreliable that enlightenment actually is. Those straight men who under ideal conditions are wonderfully tolerant of male homosexuality run away in disgust if it gets too close to them personally. It's not unlike the old liberal hypocrisy of advocating racial integration as long as they don't try to move in next door or marry our daughter.It's never wrong to expose hypocrisy or shallow virtue. It's never wrong to shine the light of truth into the dark, nasty recesses of fear and hatred in all our lives. Humpday does that brilliantly. For the billions of men who are like the two in this move, watching it could be a blessing of incalculable value. And I would never want to deprive the longsuffering and universally abused female majority of any opportunity to see how fundamentally flawed and foolish their men can be. I just don't enjoy watching it myself, and here's why:I am a gay man. Having sex with another man is as natural and healthy to me as breathing. The prospect of sex with a woman is as unnatural and repugnant to me as sex with each other is to the guys in Humpday. But I would never want a woman to have to sit through a movie that shows her brutally and graphically how very disgusting she is to me sexually. However well-adjusted she may be, being told that she disgusts me could hurt her, unnecessarily, and I wouldn't want to do that.That's exactly how Humpday makes me feel. It reminds me that the world is full of very powerful and likable men who find me disgusting, who would rather die than have to be like me or even risk seeming to be like me, and who would rather have ME die than get too close to them. What I AM disgusts and repels them.It doesn't matter that the movie is not advocating that attitude. By simply reminding me how prevalent that attitude is, it digs into old wounds and causes me pain that does not add anything good to me.I don't NEED to be reminded how much straight men despise me underneath whatever civilized veneer they may have put on, any more than African Americans need to be reminded how most in the white majority REALLY feel about them inside. It's painful, and although it IS important information, I'm not one of the ones who needs to see it.So I appreciate Humpday's artistic excellence. It is one of the most powerful and well-realized movies I've ever seen.

These are studio films and more often than not, they are labeled independent because of their slightly racy themes or ideas. Or perhaps it is a period piece. Anything a major studio can't figure out how to promote and release is embraced by these smaller, newer studios.""Humpday"" is a pure independent. All of the hallmarks of an independent film are there, low budget, unknown actors, racy story concentrating on characters and their conversations, leaving expensive location shoots to the big budget films.Ben (Mark Duplass) and Anna (Alycia Delmore) are a new couple, living in a house they recently purchased. At 2am one night, there is a loud knocking on the door and Ben finds Andrew (Joshua Leonard), an old college buddy, at the door.  Andrew goes where the wind takes him and has returned from Mexico to find funding for an art project. Anna wakes up and seems overwhelmed by her husband's friend. The next day, she offers to make her famous pork chops for the three of them, to give everyone a chance to get to know one another. But Andrew has already hooked up with two lesbians who have invited him to stay at their place. Every Friday, they have a free night of food, music and party, allowing one and all to come over and participate. Ben tries to get Andrew to come back home, but Ben soon gets sucked into the party and sticks around for a while. Some wine, some smokes and the evening slips away. Soon, Andrew's lesbian hosts bring up the upcoming Humpfest, a festival of amateur porn. Andrew and Ben come up with the idea of creating a gay porn film starring them, two straight men. As the day of the films shoot approaches, Ben has to come up with a way to tell Anna about their plans.""Humpday"" is a disappointing independent film. It's disappointing because it doesn't go far enough. When the three major characters spend the entire film discussing this amateur project they want to do and what the implications will be and who will be ""boning"" whom, you sort of expect to see the two guys at least kiss. When this happens, and is so quickly dismissed, you have to wonder why this film can't go as far as ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"". Why is it okay for Adam Sandler and Kevin James to kiss and it is not okay for Ben and Andrew go beyond that or to act differently? It doesn't make any sense to me.So when this doesn't happen, you have to look back at the rest of the film and decide if it was good enough to make up for this lack of any 'fireworks'. Are the performances, the writing and the directing interesting enough to hold your attention for the 90 minute running time? Yes and no.The three leads are all interesting and good at creating and defining their characters. We get a real sense for who each of them is and they seem believable as hell. When Ben and Anna have a ""conversation"" (fight?) because Ben and Andrew blew her off the night before, Ben begins to apologize and explain. Eventually, he says, ""I'm a good husband. I think I deserve a ""Get out of jail free"" card"". This conversation and most of the others just seem real to me. They don't have an air of the writer trying to prove how clever they are. Instead, every word feels like it could actually happen in the course of a conversation.And each of the relationships seems real. Mark Duplass and Alycia Delmore play well against each other and seem to be a real couple. And Duplass and Leonard also convincingly portray their long friendship. As Ben and Andrew catch up, reminiscing and Andrew tells Ben about his adventures, you catch a slight glance in Ben's face indicating he envies his friend, is jealous about missing out on all of the adventures his friend has had. But then you see Ben and Anna together and Ben clearly loves his wife, so everything seems good and normal.""Humpday"" is two thirds of a good independent film. It has the characters and dialogue to make a memorable film, but it lacks the conviction of a statement. Yes, the two guys talk about making a gay porn film about two straight guys, and how beautiful that would be.

1276076,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002LBKDZ8,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Humpday is a clever and original story about two friends who re-establish their relationship after not seeing each other for quite some time. Mark is a transportation engineer living in Seattle, married to Anna (Alycia Delmore) who is hoping to get pregnant and start a family. One night at about 1:30 in the morning while the couple is sleeping, Mark's old college buddy Andrew (Joshua Leonard) pounds on their door and wakes Mark and Anna up. You're expecting Mark to be annoyed that his old friend has barged in on them without calling beforehand, but surprisingly Mark is ecstatic that Andrew has reappeared in his life.Andrew is a perennial Bohemian type who would have fit right in at Woodstock circa 1969. Mark invites Andrew to stay over and he gladly accepts. We find out that Andrew is just back from Mexico but we're wondering how he supports himself. It turns out that Andrew apparently doesn't need a lot of money to get by as long as he has other Bohemian friends who'll support him. He gets himself situated in a house with the moniker 'Dionysus' prominently displayed over the front door (that should be a clue that farcical happenings are about to transpire). The house is rented by a Lesbian couple, one of whom is Monica played by the film's director, Lynn Shelton (Later Andrew puts the moves on Monica only to discover that she's thoroughly gay and doesn't want to have sex with him).Anna is about to prepare pork chops for dinner for Mark when Andrew calls and invites his buddy over for dinner at the 'Dionysus' House. Mark accepts, expecting to stay only a few hours and return for dinner with his wife. But Mark and Andrew end up getting stoned and having such a great time together that Mark loses track of time with Anna ending up eating dinner alone. While at Dionysus, the upcoming Humpfest is discussed--an artistic porn festival that invites entries from amateur filmmakers. Mark wants to prove to Andrew that getting married and settling down has not dampened his spirit for adventure nor made him into a prude so he suggests they make a film together for the festival with both of them having sex together--the novelty being that these are two straight guys willing to have 'gay sex'.There is of course one obstacle to going through with their plan and that is of course Anna, who Mark realizes might not exactly go crazy over the idea. He promises Andrew that he'll discuss it first with his wife but loses the nerve when he assumes she'll be hostile to his proposal. Later, while Andrew is having drinks with Anna alone, blurts out their novel plan of 'male bonding'.Although initially hostile, Anna eventually comes around to accepting the idea, allowing Mark to go ahead with the tryst, as she wants him to ""get it out"" of his ""system"". She even confesses that she made out with some guy while visiting a friend while they were married. Finally, Mark and Andrew meet at a motel with a video camera in order to film the sex act together. It turns out that deep down they feel awkward about the whole thing and over-intellectualize the experience by over-analyzing their feelings in front of the camera. The decision is made not to go through with the project and both Mark and Andrew agree after much deliberation, that they're ""okay"" with their decision.Writer/Director Lynn Shelton encouraged the actors to improvise most of the scenes from her script which was designed to be only a general blueprint. Mark Duplass and Joshua Leonard end up being highly entertaining as the two buddies who try to outdo one another in an amusing game of one-oneupmanship. It's funny because you don't expect the more conservative character Mark to end up outdoing his free-spirited chum in the game of 'who can be more tolerant'.In a sense, Shelton's story is a plea for tolerance as she takes the taboo subject of gay sex and has two heterosexual characters demystify it into something that is wholly non-threatening. I think most tolerant gay people will pick this up but there will always be a very small minority of 'militant' gays who will be offended since in their 'all-or-nothing' universe, the decision of the straight characters not to have sex is interpreted as a complete rejection of the gay lifestyle. Of course that is not the intent of the filmmaker, who is quite obviously a person who supports gay people.With the breezy banter between the two principals as well as the filmmaker's commendable plea for tolerance, Humpday stands out as a refreshing change of pace in the indie world chocked full of predictable melodramas and comedies peopled with implausible caricatures. Ultimately, Humpday wins no awards as a film of 'great ideas'--but fulfills the cardinal rule of farce: one is permitted the outrage without the results.",3,Refreshing tale of male bonding with plea for tolerance as added bonus,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,4806,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Humpday', 'clever', 'original', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 're-establish', 'relationship', 'not', 'seeing', 'other', 'quite', 'time', 'Mark', 'transportation', 'engineer', 'living', 'Seattle', 'married', 'Anna', 'Alycia', 'Delmore', 'who', 'hoping', 'get', 'pregnant', 'start', 'family', 'One', 'night', 'about', '1:30', 'morning', 'couple', 'sleeping', 'Mark', 'old', 'college', 'buddy', 'Andrew', 'Joshua', 'Leonard', 'pounds', 'door', 'wakes', 'Mark', 'Anna', 'up', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Mark', 'be', 'annoyed', 'old', 'friend', 'barged', 'calling', 'beforehand', 'surprisingly', 'Mark', 'ecstatic', 'Andrew', 'reappeared', 'life.Andrew', 'perennial', 'Bohemian', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'Woodstock', 'circa', '1969', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'stay', 'gladly', 'find', 'out', 'Andrew', 'just', 'back', 'Mexico', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'how', 'out', 'Andrew', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'money', 'get', 'as', 'long', 'other', 'Bohemian', 'friends', 'who', ""'ll"", 'support', 'situated', 'house', 'moniker', ""'Dionysus"", 'prominently', 'displayed', 'front', 'door', 'should', 'be', 'clue', 'farcical', 'happenings', 'are', 'transpire', 'house', 'rented', 'Lesbian', 'couple', 'one', 'whom', 'Monica', 'played', 'film', 'director', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'Later', 'Andrew', 'moves', 'Monica', 'only', 'discover', 'thoroughly', 'gay', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'sex', '.Anna', 'prepare', 'pork', 'chops', 'dinner', 'Mark', 'when', 'Andrew', 'buddy', 'dinner', ""'Dionysus"", 'House', 'Mark', 'expecting', 'stay', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'return', 'dinner', 'wife', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'stoned', 'having', 'such', 'great', 'time', 'together', 'Mark', 'track', 'time', 'Anna', 'ending', 'up', 'eating', 'dinner', 'alone', 'Dionysus', 'upcoming', 'Humpfest', 'discussed', 'artistic', 'porn', 'festival', 'entries', 'amateur', 'filmmakers', 'Mark', 'prove', 'Andrew', 'getting', 'married', 'settling', 'down', 'not', 'dampened', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'made', 'prude', 'make', 'film', 'together', 'festival', 'having', 'sex', 'together', 'novelty', 'being', 'are', 'two', 'straight', 'guys', 'willing', 'have', ""'gay"", 'course', 'one', 'obstacle', 'going', 'plan', 'course', 'Anna', 'who', 'Mark', 'realizes', 'might', 'not', 'exactly', 'go', 'crazy', 'idea', 'Andrew', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'first', 'wife', 'nerve', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hostile', 'proposal', 'Later', 'Andrew', 'having', 'drinks', 'Anna', 'alone', 'blurts', 'out', 'novel', 'plan', ""'male"", 'initially', 'hostile', 'Anna', 'eventually', 'accepting', 'idea', 'allowing', 'Mark', 'go', 'ahead', 'tryst', 'get', 'out', 'system', 'even', 'made', 'out', 'guy', 'visiting', 'friend', 'were', 'married', 'Finally', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'meet', 'motel', 'video', 'camera', 'order', 'film', 'sex', 'act', 'together', 'out', 'deep', 'feel', 'awkward', 'whole', 'thing', 'over-intellectualize', 'experience', 'over-analyzing', 'feelings', 'front', 'camera', 'decision', 'made', 'not', 'go', 'project', 'Mark', 'Andrew', 'agree', 'much', 'deliberation', ""'re"", 'okay', 'decision.Writer/Director', 'Lynn', 'Shelton', 'encouraged', 'actors', 'improvise', 'most', 'scenes', 'script', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'only', 'general', 'blueprint', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Joshua', 'Leonard', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'two', 'buddies', 'who', 'try', 'outdo', 'one', 'amusing', 'game', 'one-oneupmanship', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'conservative', 'character', 'Mark', 'end', 'up', 'outdoing', 'free-spirited', 'chum', 'game', ""'who"", 'can', 'be', 'more', ""tolerant'.In"", 'sense', 'Shelton', 'story', 'plea', 'tolerance', 'taboo', 'subject', 'gay', 'sex', 'two', 'heterosexual', 'characters', 'demystify', 'something', 'wholly', 'non-threatening', 'think', 'most', 'tolerant', 'gay', 'people', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'minority', ""'militant"", 'gays', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'offended', ""'all-or-nothing"", 'universe', 'decision', 'straight', 'characters', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'interpreted', 'complete', 'rejection', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'course', 'not', 'intent', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'quite', 'obviously', 'person', 'who', 'gay', 'breezy', 'banter', 'two', 'principals', 'as', 'well', 'filmmaker', 'commendable', 'plea', 'tolerance', 'Humpday', 'out', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'indie', 'world', 'chocked', 'full', 'predictable', 'melodramas', 'comedies', 'peopled', 'implausible', 'caricatures', 'Ultimately', 'Humpday', 'awards', 'film', ""'great"", 'ideas', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'farce', 'one', 'permitted', 'outrage', 'results']",N/A
