But of course this means that I can't tell you too much about it until you have a chance to see it for yourself. I think it is highly unlikely you will guess the ending.C. J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young TV reporter who gets convinced that District Attorney Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas) is planting evidence to get convictions. In fact, he went from having a fairly pitiful record of convictions to one of 17 straight wins. Now he's poised to run for governor, and C.J. is determined to bring him down. Enlisting the aid of his friend in the newsroom, Corey Finley (Joel Moore), he makes a terribly risky plot to get himself arrested for murder and then prove that all the evidence leading up to him was circumstantial, and presumably Hunter will take the bait and plant something conclusive, like blood on his clothes that matches the victim.Complicating everything, one way and another, is C.J.'s intense affair with Assistant DA Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn), who does not know he and Finley cooked the evidence to get the story. That is, until C.J. finds he needs her help.Nope, can't tell you anymore. Not that I think you will guess the outcome, but since I didn't, I don't want to be humiliated if you do. There are plenty enough characters in this one who are not what they seem, or who are mis-read at the very least by the other characters.

But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" kept me interested from beginning to end, and it is truly what a great suspense film should be all about.C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young, ambitious reporter, who has been investigating Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas), a powerful District Attorney who is running for Governor. He believes that Hunter wins all his conviction trials by fabricating evidence. However, C.J.'s boss informs him that the budget for investigative reporters has been cut due to low ratings, and that he has been dumped to do general assignments. Not happy with his editor's decision, he takes upon himself to proceed with Hunter's investigation, convinced that this case will make him famous and win him a Pulitzer Prize. For this purpose, he recruits Corey Finley (Joel Moore) -- his friend and colleague -- to help him in his research. He also romances Ella Crystal (Amber Tamlyn), a young attorney that works with Hunter, and unknowingly enlists her to assist him to get her boss. Unbeknown to C.J., he is in for the ride of his life.

The original screenplay by Douglas Morrow (1956) has been 'updated' by writer/director Peter Hyams, and while the concept of the plot is a strong one, it requires rather savvy actors to make it work.  Aside from Michael Douglas as the DA of questionable ethics and court procedings, the rest of the cast is a rather ill-prepared group of nascent actors in need of more experience than in the fluff films from which they came.C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) enters the Shreveport scene complete with a prize for reporting, eager to make it big and earn a Pulitzer: he seems to have an equal obsession with chasing young pretty women and finds one in the person of Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn) who happens to be the assistant to the DA.  Nicholas, and his entertaining co-worker Corey (Joel David Moore), are on to something - they believe that the DA tampers with forensic evidence to win cases, focusing on phony DNA samples rather than thorough investigation.  Out to debunk the DA, Nicholas plans to plant evidence at a crime scene, a stunt he will later use to expose the wannabe Governor DA, and in order to make this work, he places himself as the 'evidential perpetrator' of a crime.  He manages to draw Ella into his circle of lust as well as his overall plan to unseat the DA.  Things change and the ending could have been surprising in the hands of better actors.The film is heavily padded with the requisite car chases and explosions and derring-do of the good cop/bad cop type, but the real problem with the movie is the weak presence of Metcalfe and Tamblyn.  If the viewer can tolerate the confusing aspects of mixing high humor in the first part with the supposed susupense in the second, then the film is worth the entertainment.  It could have been a stronger film with a cast of professionals.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There are few things that are so chilling in film as to watch a movie that is so completely lost in plotting that there can be no redemption. Almost every film has some bright spot, some point of interest. Unfortunately, the greatest honor I can bestow upon ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"" is that it is, without equal, perhaps the silliest movie I've watched in the last year. Peter Hyams, the director, is a workmanlike pro that's been around forever. More commercial than artistic, Hyams' spotty resume includes (of all things) Van Damme's best picture (""Timecop""), one of Schwarzenegger's worst (""End of Days"") and one of my favorite good/bad movies ""Capricorn One"" (which despite some clunky acting, I could still watch endlessly). Reuniting his ""The Star Chamber"" lead, Michael Douglas, for this legal thriller probably seemed like a decent idea--but, oh, this one is painful.When an ambitious reporter (Jesse Metcalf) discovers some irregularities in the many convictions of a high-power lawyer and gubernatorial candidate (Douglas)--he sees breaking a big scandal as a ticket to the big time. Concocting the most elaborately inane scheme ever to frame himself for murder, Metcalf is preposterously out of his depth. Even our greatest actor alive couldn't sell this ridiculous piece of nonsense and, needless to say, Metcalf isn't any more up to the task. This, however, being a tricky legal thriller--there are plenty of very obvious (I mean surprising, yes that's what I meant) revelations in store for the viewers. However, even knowing every twist well in advance STILL doesn't make the plot any more feasible.Hyams and team are perhaps hoping we've never seen a real legal thriller. Someone must have thought that ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"" was a clever entertainment and perhaps one version of the script was. But devising a whole movie around ""surprise"" twists with no foundation isn't particularly clever--it's really just lazy. And, to top it off, if the ""surprises"" have no surprise factor--that just makes the whole experience practically insufferable. ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"" is an unimaginative and uber-silly retread of dozens of other, better stories. It's biggest sin, however, is to have the smarmy and loathsome Douglas (his trademark character, not he himself) and then to barely use him. I actually hated ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt."" Even if it wasn't a great film, it could have been a pleasantly entertaining one. But suspension of disbelief aside, the screenplay was just too preposterous--I literally laughed out loud, but not in a good way.

1284379,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B002QW7AMG,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","We've all seen corruption in movies before.  We've all seen movies featuring the death penalty before.  So the combination of the two probably wouldn't be that jarring for us.  Well, despite what we may have seen before, this film is decent enough to keep an audience's interest.  Suspecting corruption behind the string of in-court victories by District Attorney Mark Hunter, played by Michael Douglas, investigative journalist CJ Nicholas, played by Jesse Metcalfe, sets out to prove his theory and get one heck of a story by framing himself for the murder of a prostitute and recording evidence of the setup to expose Hunter with later.  As planned, CJ is ultimately arrested and charged with the crime thanks to the circumstantial evidence he planted.  But when his friend and cameraman, Corey Finley, played by Joel Moore, retrieves the incriminating (for Hunter) video footage, he is run down and killed by Hunter's apparent partner-in-crime, a local police officer, and the evidence is destroyed.  With nothing to ""exonerate"" himself, CJ is sentenced to death.  From Death Row, he tries to reach out to Assistant District Attorney Ella Crystal, played by Amber Tamblyn, who could be his last hope for exposing Hunter and staying alive.  This film was an okay picture, but it was underwhelming.  The best performance came from Michael Douglas, but his villainous persona remained unbalanced by any such contribution from the good guys.  Jesse Metcalfe was just bland no matter where in the film he was at.  Joel Moore was livelier, but he was seemingly killed off for that reason.  From what I know about her today, Amber Tamblyn could have also done much better.  She could have been wittier and definitely livelier.  Here, she was just the love interest who happened to have a brain at certain points in the plot.  But as far as crime films go, I've seen many worse projects and this film's twist ending was well thought out and wonderfully unexpected.

And he believes - we don't know why - that high profile District Attorney Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas) is planting false evidence to maintain a high conviction rate. So, in order to expose and publicly humiliate the DA, C.J. devises a contrived plan to set a trap for Hunter by making himself look like a prime murder suspect!Well, things terribly wrong for C.J., as you expect. This is so terribly wrong that you may start scratching your head wondering why characters including the DA's assistant Ella (Amber Tamblyn) keep doing silly things throughout the film.The whole premise could be pretty unbelievable back in 1956, when the original ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" (directed by Fritz Lang) was made. In 2010, when most people in America have an easy access to the internet and digital technologies, the story looks simply absurd. In short a reporter doesn't need this elaborate scheme. Of course, everything will be explained in the end, but by the time that happens, most viewers would stop taking the impossible story seriously.OK, I know this idea, ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" and we often need it to enjoy some classic films. But for the storyline this incredible to really work, we need something - like more round and believable characters, atmospheric cinematography, and most of all, actors and actresses as charismatic and skillful as, say, Humphrey Bogart or Barbara Stanwyck.Finally, I have been a fan of director Peter Hyams - I still like many of his film in the past, ""Capricorn One"" and ""Narrow Margin"" for instance.
