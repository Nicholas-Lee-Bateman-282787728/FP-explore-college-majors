I've seen a million TV miniseries based off novels that have sucked so horrendously, but NONE like this.  Get this straight before I continue: I LOVE the book version of The Tommyknockers; it's my alltime favorite Stephen King novel (second-favorite: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon... review to come later) and I liked how it took the time to reveal key things about the plot: how Haven got started (and the ""sowing and reaping"" the itinerant preacher got on with the virgins in the cornfield), how Gard and Bobbi originally got to be such good friends (more than that actually; they dated for some time), and what actually went on in the woods that unleashed the evil.  Here... bulls**t.  Utter bulls**t.  Here is why I think the movie sucked:- The series is only 3 hours long... what the f**k?  A novel the size of The Tommyknockers can't possibly be fit into a 3-hour long series.  What about the minor stuff that, although minor, can't be taken out without a serious loss in credibility?  Like Hilly.  There wasn't much of him or his disappearing act with his little brother David, and there certainly wasn't enough of his tenure at Altair-4 or their frantic search for his body.  And what about Gard and how he opened up the hole to suck in his conniving ex-poker buddy after getting cheated on a poker game?  That scene would have been amazing in the movie.  But no.  None of it.-The changes the authors made in the plotline.  Seriously. Get some things at least partially right, then change what you have to in order to fulfill whatever sick and twisted purpose you had in mind when changing the original.  But they take it too far.  Example: in the novel, Gard and Bobbi's teeth originally fell out because of their ""becoming""; now, nothing.  And, the aliens themselves have a full set of teeth (that part in the novel)... so why the (insert obscenity here) did they change it?!?!The only reason I gave this particular hellfest two stars is cause the original was made by Stephen King.

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[2, 3]","Many years ago, I read the creative Stephen King book on which this movie is based and have always remembered it. King is a master at pacing, suspense and outright horror. This is one of his most unique plots, IMO. It kept me guessing...and reading long past my bedtime.Now today was Stephen King Movie Day in my neck of the woods (no, not Maine, but Sunny Cali) and I just had to watch hisRose RedandThe Tommyknockers. Both kept me on the edge of my seat, but I liked Tommyknockers best, so chose to review it first. I may review Red Rose later; it deserves it too.I thought The Tommyknockers was a three-hour movie, but it lasted four hours. You can tell how much I was obsessed with it because nothing keeps me away from my computer for that length of time.Of course, the movie was not as great as Stephen King's novel, but movies seldom live up to the books preceding them. I foundThe Tommyknockersvery exciting, with so many twists and turns and ""gory"" visuals that it made me gasp over and over. Both Jimmy Smits and Marge Helgenberger were well-cast for their roles, making this science fiction adventure come to life for me. I couldn't believe what Helgenberger's character found in the woods and how it effected her and the entire Maine town where the action takes place.I liked it so well, I went on Amazon.com and ordered a copy for a friend who was upset because she was out of town and missed this airing. When I like something well enough to put out hard-earned money, then that's a five-star recommendation to me.If you decide to get your own copy ofThe Tommyknockers, be sure to lock your doors and keep some lights on.

190131,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,1573624098,Bruce Rux,"[14, 15]","The book and the miniseries differ, but both are quite good.  For the jaded veterans among you, it's essentially Five Million Years to Earth, served up a la King.Marg Helgenberger trips over an ancient flying saucer in the woods one day while walking her dog, and decides it might make a nice private playground centerpiece if dug out and spiffied-up a bit.  She starts experiencing a creative psychic brain-boost during the lengthy process, which is shared by a few of the nearby townsfolk.  Her old lover, Jimmy Smits, however, an alcoholic poet of some former reputation with a metal plate in his skull, is left cold by Marg's new pet project  -  the saucer gives him a headache, literally.Pretty soon, the nearby isolated small town begins splitting-up into two factions  -  those who are sympatico with the saucer's psychic space-vibes, and those who aren't.  Those who are become inventive geniuses, and those who aren't start more and more looking like dinner.  Only Jimmy Smits is sufficiently immune to the nasty thing to exercise his presence of mind, and somehow stop the saucer and its long-mummified occupants from revitalizing themselves off Marg and the other infected townsfolk.This is a very handsomely produced piece, and sufficiently close to Stephen King's original novel that the changes made in the script  -  which are only done to simplify (and under-grue) the action, and allow a little alien activity  -  are more welcome than not.  The cast are all terrific, especially leads Helgenberger and Smits.  Helgenberger's transformation due to her dangerous alien exposure is nicely counterpointed with Smits' alcoholism, the saucer's influence acting like a drug to those who respond to its emanations.  The special effects are great, and the inclusion of the revitalized aliens on the saucer in the finale is a nice touch  -  they're pretty cool, really.  The suspense works well.  The only real flaw with this piece is a bit too much padding, but the same can be said of most of Stephen King's work in general, and certainly this production has less of it than the novel on which it is based.",4,Alien Savants Run Amok!,1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,2116,"['book', 'miniseries', 'differ', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'jaded', 'veterans', 'essentially', 'Five', 'Million', 'Years', 'Earth', 'served', 'up', 'la', 'King.Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'ancient', 'flying', 'saucer', 'woods', 'one', 'day', 'walking', 'dog', 'might', 'make', 'nice', 'private', 'playground', 'centerpiece', 'dug', 'out', 'spiffied-up', 'bit', 'experiencing', 'creative', 'psychic', 'brain-boost', 'lengthy', 'process', 'shared', 'few', 'nearby', 'townsfolk', 'old', 'lover', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'however', 'alcoholic', 'poet', 'former', 'reputation', 'metal', 'plate', 'skull', 'left', 'cold', 'Marg', 'new', 'pet', 'project', 'saucer', 'headache', 'literally.Pretty', 'soon', 'nearby', 'isolated', 'small', 'town', 'splitting-up', 'two', 'factions', 'who', 'are', 'sympatico', 'saucer', 'psychic', 'space-vibes', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'are', 'become', 'inventive', 'geniuses', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'start', 'more', 'more', 'looking', 'dinner', 'Only', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'sufficiently', 'immune', 'nasty', 'thing', 'exercise', 'presence', 'mind', 'somehow', 'stop', 'saucer', 'long-mummified', 'occupants', 'revitalizing', 'off', 'Marg', 'other', 'infected', 'townsfolk.This', 'very', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'piece', 'sufficiently', 'close', 'Stephen', 'King', 'original', 'novel', 'changes', 'made', 'script', 'are', 'only', 'done', 'simplify', 'under-grue', 'action', 'allow', 'little', 'alien', 'activity', 'are', 'more', 'welcome', 'not', 'cast', 'are', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Helgenberger', 'Smits', 'Helgenberger', 'transformation', 'due', 'dangerous', 'alien', 'exposure', 'nicely', 'counterpointed', 'Smits', 'alcoholism', 'saucer', 'influence', 'acting', 'drug', 'who', 'respond', 'emanations', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'inclusion', 'revitalized', 'aliens', 'saucer', 'finale', 'nice', 'touch', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'cool', 'really', 'suspense', 'well', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'piece', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'padding', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'general', 'certainly', 'production', 'less', 'novel', 'based']",N/A

Cohen, about a town whose people become alien mutates who are possessed by aliens still in a buried spaceship, who force the townspeople on a mission to uncover the ship from the ground in the woods surrounding the town. The acting in this film is excellent, most notably from Marg Helgenberger and Jimmy Smits. The special effects (for a TV movie) are superb and the aliens look unbelievably eerie, and the usage of the green light is often effective too. The plot is not exactly the most original, but the way it's captured in this miniseries is most refreshing and riveting. The music score is standard horror movie fare, but it is quite suitable for the film and adds tension and atmosphere. There isn't really anything wrong with this movie except that the story is, like I said, not the most highly original and the narrative is kind of slow. However, it is a spine-tingling tale of horror and shouldn't be missed by serious Stephen King fans, or sci-fi/horror fans for that matter.

From the start, the movie is very interesting.The plot of the movie is rather simple. Jim, a recovering alcoholic, comes home to his girlfrind Bobbi in some small town where everyone knows each other. Bobbi discovers an artifact that somehow gives her the ability to do many extraordinary things. Eventually the entire town, with the exception of very few people including Jim, comes under the spell of this mysterious artifact that is granting everyone the ability to do extraordinary things but at the same time overtakes their mind to keep digging up the artifact. Eventually Jim tries to stop Bobbi and the town, but is met with opposition.The movie starts off really, really good. I got hooked on it. Then at the end of the movie, it went off into the deep end. It was a huge, huge disappointment and it felt like I wasted the 2 hours sitting there watching it just to watch something silly.To give the plot, the artifact is somehow an alien ship buried deep in the ground. I believe it was found to crash landed there sometime in the past and it appears everyone on the ship died minus a few who needed the life force of the local residents to launch their ship. The ending was so ridiculous and silly that it hardly made any sense and certainly ruined the entire build up of the movie. The aliens were obvious puppets and when Jim and his girlfriend Bobbie fought them, they were obviously fighting just a doll that you can clearly tell apart.Overall hugely disappointed with the ending. The ending really ruined everything else in the movie. The only good thing is up to the part where they discovered it was an alien ship. From there, once you meet the aliens, that's where the movie ends and the silliness starts.

But the ending of the story is  almost completely different from that set out in King's novel, and is  definitely inferior.  The incorporation of &quot;dormant&quot; aliens  brought back to life by sucking the life-energies of living humans was NOT  what occurred in the book, and in this film version seemed really stupid.  The female protagonist Bobbi Anderson experienced a totally different fate  in the screen version, and this grated on me.  And worst of all, the people  in the book lost their teeth as part of their process of being transformed  into &quot;Tommyknockers.&quot;  In the movie, people lost their teeth, but  the &quot;aliens&quot; themselves had full sets of teeth--so what was the  point of the tooth loss by humans?Still, for most of the way, the  production was carried out reasonably skillfully.  Yes, at times the plot  drags a bit, but that's how the book unfolded, as well.  Overall, this  adaptation is a nice try, worth seeing, but not likely to be remembered as  a &quot;triumph.&quot;",3,Reasonably faithful to the book until the disappointing end,947116800,"01 6, 2000",2000,1432,"['When', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'requirement', 'follow', 'plot', 'set', 'out', 'print', 'version', 'significant', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'need', 'seem', 'justified', 'case', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'production', 'strayed', 'book', 'ways', 'were', 'justifiable', 'most', 'considerable', 'length', 'subplots', 'characters', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'translated', 'well', 'screen', 'version', 'ending', 'story', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'set', 'out', 'King', 'novel', 'definitely', 'inferior', 'incorporation', 'quot', 'dormant', 'quot', 'aliens', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'sucking', 'life-energies', 'living', 'humans', 'was', 'NOT', 'what', 'occurred', 'book', 'film', 'version', 'seemed', 'really', 'stupid', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Bobbi', 'Anderson', 'experienced', 'totally', 'different', 'fate', 'screen', 'version', 'grated', 'worst', 'people', 'book', 'lost', 'teeth', 'part', 'process', 'being', 'transformed', 'quot', 'Tommyknockers.', 'quot', 'movie', 'people', 'lost', 'teeth', 'quot', 'quot', 'had', 'full', 'sets', 'teeth', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'tooth', 'loss', 'humans', 'Still', 'most', 'way', 'production', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'reasonably', 'skillfully', 'Yes', 'times', 'plot', 'bit', 'how', 'book', 'unfolded', 'well', 'Overall', 'adaptation', 'nice', 'try', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'quot', 'quot']",N/A

Originally a 1993 tv miniseries, the movie suffers from lackluster direction, mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror.  Typically set in a homey little New England town, the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer (Marg Helgenberger) who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend(a poorly cast Jimmy Smits) decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed.  Meanwhile, a ghostly green light emits from the object, causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another, whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes.  At three hours, THE TOMMYKNOCKERS definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take; it can become redundant.

As a movie, though, the only things keeping it from total failure are Jimmy Smits and Marg Helgenberger. I've seen Smits in some very poor movies, but he seems to manage a good to great performance regardless.The main difference between the book and the film is that in the book the ship was causing the townsfolk to mutate into the species that designed the ship, which explains the loss of teeth, etc. The movie doesn't make much sense, even if you've read the book.There are several screen adaptations of King's work that are better than this. I really enjoyed Firestarter and Pet Sematary and they stayed fairly close to the book. The same is true for The Dead Zone, which also has IMO the best performance ever by Christoper Walken. Carrie is also a very good movie, The Shining was good, and Salem's Lot is a pretty good &quot;stab&quot; at traditional horror in the form of vampires. Of course, Green Mile, The Stand, and Shawshank Redemtion are great movies, too.There are more bad movies from King's books than there are good ones, though. Both incarnations of his short story &quot;Trucks&quot; are bombs. Maximum Overdrive was hilariously bad, with a Emilio Estevez that is way over the top.

190153,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,1573624098,RMurray847,"[3, 3]","Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its ""will"" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to ""suddenly"" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)Back to the ""movie.""  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the ""head nerd"" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away!",2,Not good...simple as that.,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,3350,"['disappointing', 'Stephen', 'King', 'miniseries', 'reason', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rewatching', 'older', 'Stephen', 'King', 'miniseries', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'originally', 'aired', 'Maybe', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'commercials', 'drag', 'on.The', 'cream', 'crop', 'STAND', 'dregs', 'LANGOLIERS', 'worst', 'special', 'effects', 'ever', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'TOMMYKNOCKERS', 'somewhere', 'between.Basically', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'lady', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'mysterious', 'little', 'object', 'woods', 'compelled', 'unearth', 'out', 'sort', 'alien', 'craft', 'power', 'exert', 'will', 'people', 'little', 'Maine', 'town', 'nearby', 'people', 'undergo', 'gradual', 'not', 'so', 'gradual', 'personality', 'changes', 'suddenly', 'invent', 'impossible', 'machines', 'read', 'others', 'minds', 'also', 'gleefully', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'thwart', 'them.That', 'well', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'clean', 'gory', 'fun', 'Certainly', 'book', 'based', 'was', 'know', 'King', 'not', 'terribly', 'fond', 'book', 'mostly', 'wrote', 'height', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'additions', 'contained', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'too', 'believable', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'romance', 'two', 'leads', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'King', 'nadir', 'was', 'THE', 'DARK', 'HALF', 'Back', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Helgenberger', 'boyfriend', 'formerly', 'successful', 'poet', 'now', 'alcoholism', 'trying', 'climb', 'hole', 'immune', 'power', 'Tommyknockers', 'steel', 'plate', 'head', 'along', 'ride', 'much', 'story', 'guilt', 'own', 'behavior', 'Eventually', 'things', 'get', 'bad', 'enough', 'finally', 'up', 'courage', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'rather', 'serious', 'consequences', 'story', 'told', 'plodding', 'manner', 'compelling', 'scene', 'example', 'early', 'Smits', 'reception', 'where', 'been', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'gloriously', 'over-the-top', 'embarrassing', 'moment', 'two', 'clunkers', 'Cliff', 'De', 'Young', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'two', 'postal', 'employees', 'undergoing', 'serious', 'hanky-panky', 'sorting', 'room', 'Helgenberger', 'Smits', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'local', 'sheriff', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'kindly', 'lengthy', 'novel', 'been', 'condensed', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'subplot', 'DeYoung', 'Lords', 'given', 'FAR', 'FAR', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'screen', 'De', 'Young', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'EVER', 'get', 'more', 'one', 'role', 'keep', 'make', 'even', 'gamest', 'performances', 'worthwhile', 'guess', 'producers', 'were', 'so', 'tickled', 'have', 'former', 'porn', 'star', 'Lords', 'set', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'coming', 'up', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'do', 'Also', 'are', 'forced', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'Robert', 'Carradine', 'so', 'good', 'head', 'nerd', 'REVENGE', 'THE', 'NERDS', 'years', 'ago', 'fallen', 'perfectly', 'dreadful', 'performance.The', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'are', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'forgiven', 'had', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'been', 'managed', 'THE', 'TOMMYKNOCKERS', 'was', 'doomed', 'start', 'pitiful', 'script', 'not', 'helped', 'uninspired', 'direction', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Smits', 'Cassidy', 'Helgenberger', 'guess', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'gander', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'horror/sci-fi', 'stay', 'away']",N/A
