854538,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00031TXC2,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[78, 90]","The music in this film is exquisite, with Chopin's compositions primarily played by Polish virtuoso Janusz Olejniczak, and other musicians in the soundtrack are Emanuel Ax and Yukio Yokoyama (piano), Yo Yo Ma (cello), and Vadim Brodsky and Pamela Frank (violin). The music however, no matter how glorious, didn't keep my interest throughout this rather overlong film. Not only does the film need editing in length, but some of the cuts are peculiar, and don't flow well.It's an uneven tale of Chopin's relationship with novelist George Sand and her children, and Chopin's destructive self-obsession that turn the family into the ultimate dysfunctional scenario. The scene about the chicken leg versus the breast meat descends into the absurd and humorous, and though I realize there are people as silly and petty as how Chopin is portrayed (and I know little about his history), 134 minutes of this sort of petulance gets very boring.Piotr Adamczyk plays Chopin with a remarkable physical resemblance, and Danuta Stenka fares the best in the thankless role of George Sand, as she tries to keep the sun revolving around Chopin, while keeping her children from doing something unhelpful, like committing suicide.Filmed in Warsaw, Paris and Majorca, the cinematography is nice (by Edward Klosinski), with a lot of meadow scenes and wildflower picking.If this film resembles Chopin's life, then perhaps it is best to just listen to his music.

854539,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B00031TXC2,Anne-Marie G,"[10, 10]","This is not the first treatment of the Sand/Chopin love affair. It is the second of the lot that I have seen.  What intrigued me about it was that it was firstly a Polish production and it was mostly from Chopin's point of view.The costumes and the music were fantastic as was the casting/make-up of showing the dispairity in age and health between Sand and Chopin.  Sand looks more mature but exceedingly healthy while Chopin is clearly younger and weaker.The movie is a little drawn out, as far as I am concerned. And while it does attempt to explain what went wrong in Sand and Chopin's relationship it never really does much beyond a few Florence Nightengale scenes to show what went right--why they stayed together for eight years, as far as the movie is concerned it was mostly intolerable.  It also wasn't the best at introducing new characters or certain plot points.  I  was only able to figure certain things out from all of the reading about Sand that I have done.Not only is the movie drawn out, but it also seems disjointed in places. Especially the leap from Majorica and a 12 year old Solange to Paris where Solange is now a woman, in love with Chopin (something that is not a proven fact--only a bit of lore--thought it is true that in his last days he was closer to her than her mother).I think my favorite scene in the whole of the movie was the moment on the stairs when Chopin informs Sand of her grand-daughter's birth. It was as if it was right out of time, it so captured the awkwardness and lingering pain and longing of what their relationship had degenerated into.All of the actors do an amazing job. Especially the leads (Chopin and Sand) she is feminine and strong and he looks amazingly like him (though he doesn't play any of the comedy that Hugh Grant did) caputuring that delicacy that Chopin always seemed to  be known for.Not a bad movie, but probably confusing to anyone who is unfamiliar with the story of Sand and Chopin.",3,What love?,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1958,"['not', 'first', 'treatment', 'Sand/Chopin', 'love', 'affair', 'second', 'lot', 'have', 'seen', 'What', 'intrigued', 'was', 'was', 'firstly', 'Polish', 'production', 'was', 'mostly', 'Chopin', 'point', 'view.The', 'costumes', 'music', 'were', 'fantastic', 'was', 'casting/make-up', 'showing', 'dispairity', 'age', 'health', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'more', 'mature', 'exceedingly', 'healthy', 'Chopin', 'clearly', 'younger', 'weaker.The', 'movie', 'little', 'drawn', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'attempt', 'explain', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'relationship', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'few', 'Florence', 'Nightengale', 'scenes', 'show', 'what', 'went', 'right', 'why', 'stayed', 'together', 'eight', 'years', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'concerned', 'was', 'mostly', 'intolerable', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'figure', 'certain', 'things', 'out', 'reading', 'Sand', 'have', 'done.Not', 'only', 'movie', 'drawn', 'also', 'disjointed', 'places', 'Especially', 'leap', 'Majorica', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Solange', 'Paris', 'where', 'Solange', 'now', 'woman', 'love', 'Chopin', 'something', 'not', 'proven', 'fact', 'only', 'bit', 'lore', 'thought', 'true', 'last', 'days', 'was', 'closer', 'mother', '.I', 'think', 'favorite', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'moment', 'stairs', 'when', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'grand-daughter', 'birth', 'was', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'so', 'captured', 'awkwardness', 'lingering', 'pain', 'longing', 'what', 'relationship', 'had', 'degenerated', 'into.All', 'actors', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'Especially', 'leads', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'feminine', 'strong', 'amazingly', ""n't"", 'play', 'comedy', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'did', 'caputuring', 'delicacy', 'Chopin', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'known', 'for.Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'probably', 'confusing', 'anyone', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'Sand', 'Chopin']",Chopin: Desire For Love

854544,AYPWXM267TM2K,B00031TXC2,Dexter Tay,"[12, 14]","This is one of the two or three movies made that portrays Frederick Chopin - whose music enthralls the senses and whose personality is of easy prey to theatrical play.The reviews presented here have brought out the most obvious flaws of the movie which I need not discuss further, though I would have to commend the rather admirable acting undertaken by the leading actor and actress.That Chopin was described as a selfish boor here I must quite agree, and the film certainly reiterates the stereotype of Chopin as a narcissistic, withdrawn, idiosyncratic and insufferable man, in spite of the ethereal qualities of his music. Rather than bridging these seemingly irreconciliable aspects, the film sought to present them ""as they are"".The quality of the image leaves much to be desired - despite being a rather recent production, the clarity of the image is inferior to say, Impromptu, shot more than 10 years earlier.Speaking of which I would like to say, Impromptu has a wholesome lot more of entertainment than what the dry satire of Desire for Love, intended or otherwise, could have afford. Impromptu's comical approach, though perhaps historically less accurate is clearly more successful than Desire for Love's quasi-epic and biographical attempt.The reason for awarding three stars is the rather disjointed sequences and dialogues that do not seem to leave the film with any clear sense of direction, making it appear to be rather  stiff, stifled and lengthy.The amusing segments that adversely up-ed the viewing pleasure, though in a slightly ""perversed"" manner, had to be the farce-inducing, heated argument over the chicken parts (which may very well be a real issue for heated debate despite its ludicrousness) as well as the older Solange's irritatingly obsessive behavior, somewhat of a miscast for an actress who seems obviously too old for the role and unfortunately does not possess the physical features that endears the audience to her plight.",3,"Obviously flawed, but entirely watchable",1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1962,"['one', 'two', 'three', 'movies', 'made', 'portrays', 'Frederick', 'Chopin', 'music', 'senses', 'personality', 'easy', 'prey', 'theatrical', 'play.The', 'reviews', 'presented', 'here', 'have', 'brought', 'out', 'most', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'discuss', 'further', 'would', 'have', 'commend', 'rather', 'admirable', 'acting', 'undertaken', 'leading', 'actor', 'Chopin', 'was', 'described', 'selfish', 'boor', 'here', 'must', 'quite', 'agree', 'film', 'certainly', 'stereotype', 'Chopin', 'narcissistic', 'withdrawn', 'idiosyncratic', 'insufferable', 'man', 'spite', 'ethereal', 'qualities', 'music', 'Rather', 'bridging', 'seemingly', 'irreconciliable', 'aspects', 'film', 'sought', 'present', 'are', '.The', 'quality', 'image', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'being', 'rather', 'recent', 'production', 'clarity', 'image', 'inferior', 'say', 'Impromptu', 'shot', 'more', '10', 'years', 'earlier.Speaking', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'Impromptu', 'wholesome', 'lot', 'more', 'entertainment', 'what', 'dry', 'satire', 'Desire', 'Love', 'intended', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'afford', 'Impromptu', 'comical', 'approach', 'perhaps', 'historically', 'less', 'accurate', 'clearly', 'more', 'successful', 'Desire', 'Love', 'quasi-epic', 'biographical', 'attempt.The', 'reason', 'awarding', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'sequences', 'dialogues', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'leave', 'film', 'clear', 'sense', 'direction', 'making', 'appear', 'be', 'rather', 'stiff', 'stifled', 'lengthy.The', 'amusing', 'segments', 'adversely', 'up-ed', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'though', 'slightly', 'perversed', 'manner', 'had', 'be', 'farce-inducing', 'heated', 'argument', 'chicken', 'parts', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'real', 'issue', 'heated', 'debate', 'ludicrousness', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'Solange', 'irritatingly', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'actress', 'who', 'obviously', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'possess', 'physical', 'features', 'audience', 'plight']",Chopin: Desire For Love

And the waiting was all worthwhile.Chopin: Desire for Love is an exquisite film about Chopin's life.  Chopin's music is played throughout the film and the director's musical selection for each scene is most appropriate and touching.  The entire cast, all Polish, is great.  Piotr Adamczyk as Chopin is fantastic.  In the second half of the film, his portrayal of a lonely and ailing Chopin just breaks your heart.  The story is very close to history.  I'm a huge fan of Chopin and have read every version of his biography that I could get my hands on.  Many scenes are based on true stories, including some of the dialogues and letters quoted.  Chopin and George Sand's last meeting in the film is almost identical to what actually happened, according to many Chopin's biographies.  The part about Chopin and Solange, George Sand's daughter, is a little further than the truth.  Still, this is the closest version to Chopin's life, compared with Impromptu and A Song to Remember.The film runs 134 minutes long and you just don't want it to end.

Why do you say is George Sand a central figure in this? Simple-Chopin's most poetic and expressive works were created when he had his ""sinful laison"" with this Sand woman. (What the movie failed to show to viewers when Chopin first met Sand, he was revoted by her....Chopin commented ""Is this George Sand really a woman? I tend to doubt it!"") Interesting to note--despite all of the wonderful musical compositions he created while living with her, NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF MUSIC WAS EVER dedicated to Geoge Sand.  Perhaps Chopin was just using George Sand for a stable place to stay, bed and board (I'm not certain of the financial arrangements between these two, but I tend to think she paid most if not all the bills!). Chopin also most likely viewed Sand as socially inferior, and there is evidence he thought her inferior to him, but was equally extremely jealous and possessive of her; remarkably, Chopin was considered an aristrocrat, and not merely a performer of music, among all social circles. So, he never felt her worthy to dedicate a single composition to her.I tend to think Chopin viewed George Sand as a strong motherly figure who took care of him. As he was very sickly, and possessed an obsessional personality.True Chopin created his Etudes while he was 19 years old, but never in history was there more beautiful and heavenly tones ever penned during his years with that Sand woman. George Sand cared for him, but her incredibly spoiled children drove a wedge between them. Maurice, the son of Sand, was jealous of his mother's attention to Chopin. Solange--well--she wanted Chopin for herself, and tried to seduce him. Sooo...can you imagine how things went in the family.Despite all of this perhaps due to the caring of Sand Chopin felt ""settled"" thus produced his most remarkable works.I would say his film far exceeds the movie ""Impromptu"". Chopin: Desire for Love, if you want to have a pretty good idea of Chopin's personal relationship and how it affected his works, please see this movie. I'm not saying it's 100% accurate, and things historical should in my opinion have been included. (For example, a main reason why the couple took off to Majorica is to escape the SCANDAL.) Still, it's a pretty remarkable work. It's VERY WELL acted. Chopin had a lot to blame for the breakup--he was emotionally cold, easily roused to jealousy, and to add to this Sand's spoiled children. Add years of this sort of behavior. The movie SHOULD have included-Just before the Sand and Chopin breakup, Sand wrote a novel entitled Lucrezia Floriani. I truly believe this was the ""final straw"" that broke up the relationship for it is a thinly disguised account of their rocky relationship. Everybody in social circles, including Franz Liszt, recognized Prince Karole as Chopin, and Lucrezia Floriani as George Sand, even reading to her distingued guests this most back stabbing novel, revealing to all quite shamelessly a thinly disguised account of their own relationship to the world. While Chopin himself listened to the novel being read to her guests, he kept a quiet exterior. It was a kind of revenge George Sand had.  It was not far after this reading, Chopin left Nohant and Sand's life forever.  THAT should have been included in the movie, as I feel it was extremely important contributing to the breakup. Drama Trauma. Can you imagine how it must have felt for Chopin, who is socially conscious, to have his dirty laundry aired before the world?The Sand-Chopin affair is reflected in Chopin's music-some creations most sublime and highly emotional; others dark and turbulent. Their relationship was the sum total of Romanticism: Emotion, and huge quantities of it, and extreme.  (It was fashionable at the time, for example, to threaten suicide, because it represented emotional turbulence, and anything emotional was....art.)Did Chopin and this Sand woman really have sex as the movie depicted? To be honest I tend to seriously doubt it. He was infected with tuberculosis, and it's short of a miracle the whole household didn't die of it.You gotta see this movie! I absolutely worship Frederic Chopin and practice only his music, and I have read many biographical sources of his life including his letters, and George Sand. This movie is closest to the actual relationship that I can think of. I think it's pure genius.But George Sand should never be seen as a villian, for she was a remarkably liberated woman who was ahead of her time. Remember she existed when the slave trade was going on in the United States in the 1800's. She viewed woman as equals to men, and nothing wrong with being independent. And her contribution of great quantities of love and care toward Chopin that inspired the most sublime works for the pianoforte ever in history that far exceeds the complete powers of an entire orchestra and chorus combined, was undeniable due to the influence of Chopin's love for George Sand.",5,Best film on Frederic Chopin I ever seen,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,5013,"['So', 'far',

There was almost no attention on Chopin's creative process, thoughts about music, etc. It was all about the craziness of Sand and her children in relation to him. One thing I found distracting and annoying is that when we first meet Sand's children, there is a little girl and a son who appears to be in his 20s but behaves and is treated like a 12 year old. Then the story jumps to ""years later"" and the daughter (different actress) is a young woman and the son (same actor) looks and acts the same as before. It adds to the obsurdity of the story.

As usual, the impression is given that George Sand lost her femininity entirely every time she put on a pair of pants and a top hat or lit up a smoke.  She wore what were then exclusively men's clothes (at least in the higher society through which she moved) because they were comfortable and she was cute and attracted attention, not so that she could act like Jimmy Cagney in a ganster movie!  I doubt that she was any less feminine in a suit than Ms. Hepburn or Ms. Loy were in slacks.  Unfortunately, here Sand is depicted as a publicly leering and too-forward female roue, whether in pants or skirts.  The acting is over-the-top melodramatic, the screenplay needs a lot more craft to eliminate the indulgence of noisy, boring, forced family cavorting about the coutryside among Sand, her son and daughter, and Uncle Frederic.  Continuity around the casting and aging of Solange is particularly lacking.  The movie also provokes my usual beef with depictions of George Sand which is that she is is rarely shown as the maxi-capable work horse she was, writing through the night, fueled with coffee and chocolat, to support herself, her children and Chopin, after her day spent running a grand home, managing the staff that was required to keep a houseful of people comfortable by providing food, lodging and entertainment for her artist guests at Nohant.That said, the depiction of what went wrong between Sand and Chopin, and among them and Sand's understandably messed up children is fairly drawn, i.e., the hexed weather and ruinous housing conditions in the unfortunate excursion to Mallorca, Chopin's illness stifling Sand's and his erotic life, her boomerang-style of overindulgence with total dismissal of her children.  In most biographies of the people involved, it is clear that no one behaved very well as their golden ages passed.  Having enjoyed biographies of Sand and Chopin, Liszt and Marie D'Agoult and their own messed up children, etc., I stuck with this movie based on some sense of loyalty to the subjects, but my husband gave it ""six rotten tomatoes"" ten minutes into it, and left the room!",1,If you absolutely must....,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,2404,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'beginning', 'based', 'beautiful', 'art', 'direction', 'costumes', 'period', 'hair', 'styles', 'street', 'scenes', 'etc', 'CD', 'problematic', 'sound', 'forces', 'constant', 'volume', 'adjustment', 'are', 'sensitive', 'sudden', 'blasts', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'screaming', 'shouting', 'usual', 'impression', 'given', 'George', 'Sand', 'lost', 'femininity', 'entirely', 'time', 'put', 'pair', 'pants', 'top', 'hat', 'lit', 'up', 'smoke', 'wore', 'what', 'were', 'then', 'exclusively', 'men', 'clothes', 'least', 'higher', 'society', 'moved', 'were', 'comfortable', 'was', 'cute', 'attracted', 'attention', 'not', 'could', 'act', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'ganster', 'movie', 'doubt', 'was', 'less', 'feminine', 'suit', 'Ms.', 'Hepburn', 'Ms.', 'Loy', 'were', 'slacks', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'Sand', 'depicted', 'publicly', 'leering', 'too-forward', 'female', 'roue', 'pants', 'skirts', 'acting', 'over-the-top', 'melodramatic', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'more', 'craft', 'eliminate', 'indulgence', 'noisy', 'boring', 'forced', 'family', 'cavorting', 'coutryside', 'Sand', 'son', 'daughter', 'Uncle', 'Frederic', 'Continuity', 'casting', 'aging', 'Solange', 'particularly', 'lacking', 'movie', 'also', 'usual', 'beef', 'depictions', 'George', 'Sand', 'rarely', 'shown', 'maxi-capable', 'work', 'horse', 'was', 'writing', 'night', 'fueled', 'coffee', 'chocolat', 'support', 'children', 'Chopin', 'day', 'spent', 'running', 'grand', 'home', 'managing', 'staff', 'was', 'required', 'keep', 'houseful', 'people', 'comfortable', 'providing', 'food', 'lodging', 'entertainment', 'artist', 'guests', 'Nohant.That', 'said', 'depiction', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'Sand', 'understandably', 'messed', 'up', 'children', 'fairly', 'drawn', 'i.e.', 'hexed', 'weather', 'ruinous', 'housing', 'conditions', 'unfortunate', 'excursion', 'Mallorca', 'Chopin', 'illness', 'stifling', 'Sand', 'erotic', 'life', 'boomerang-style', 'overindulgence', 'total', 'dismissal', 'children', 'most', 'biographies', 'people', 'involved', 'clear', 'one', 'behaved', 'very', 'well', 'golden', 'ages', 'passed', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'biographies', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'Liszt', 'Marie', ""D'Agoult"", 'own', 'messed', 'up', 'children', 'etc.', 'stuck', 'movie', 'based', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'subjects', 'husband', 'gave', 'six', 'rotten', 'tomatoes', 'ten', 'minutes', 'left', 'room']",Chopin: Desire For Love

I was either turning the sound way up or way down.The subtitles are only in Spanish, which helped a little, but the language wasn't always accurate.There wasn't much story there at all.  Chopin and Sand catch each other's eye in a courtyard, later she sees him play, and sends him a note.  Although she was speaking English, her accent made it impossible to understand her - she was one of the whisperers...except when she was shouting that Chopin drove her crazy with his refusal to answer her questions...anyway, I did not understand the attraction on either's part.

Sand wants everybody to get along, but it's like having three kids instead of two...Chopin does not see why her children need any attention from her and he resents them.  Maurice is sick with jealousy of Chopin, and Sand tries to soothe him.  Chopin appears to never have shown any interest in the children...so Sand is running between her children and him and trying to please everyone (for what?)...Chopin is diagnosed with TB, and the doctor tells Sand it is very contagious and to get her kids out of there.  She makes no comment...later daughter tells her suspicions that Chopin is consumptive and they shouldn't be around him...Sand ignores her.  Chopin doesn't start coughing (loudly - sound DOWN)until the very end of the movie.  Chopin and Sand have an argument and he tells her to get out.  End of scene.Next scene ""Years Later"" we are told....how many years, or what transpired in those years, we are not told.  Chopin and Sand are living together with the kids...daughter Solange has grown and now considers herself in love with Chopin because he is a ""genius.""

Maurice says he has the authority to throw Chopin out....maybe this is Maurice's property?  We are not told.  There's lots of running through the field, running down the road (fast forward!) and much screeching with laughter (sound DOWN)for no apparent reason.

It adds sooo much to the enjoyment of their music by portraying the life and times of these famous people who so rudely  died before our time.  But their music will go on forever as tribute to the love we all feel for each other.  So often great performers and composers are seen as &#34;unstable&#34;, &#34;deranged&#34; or &#34;plain crazy&#34;, but are they.  Perhaps we are the odd ones seeking stability and harmony with a moment of calm afforded by the timeless beauty of music.Though we enjoy the music from these great minds from long ago, we have amazing composers with us today.  I am not sure I am aware of all of the current Masters, but many stand in today's music as did Chopin, Mozart and Bach.
