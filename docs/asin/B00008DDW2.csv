Jonah and the Whale seemed to be very well thought out. It did add a storyline that was not mentioned in the bible, but it didn't step out of its bounds and did not contradict scripture. It looked like they really searched this out historically to make it better. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to watch the rest of the series.One thing you will notice about this video is that (unlike most children's bible videos) it is not corny and doesn't make the characters out to be silly goofballs. I feel this is very important. Your children need to be able to relate to these characters as real life examples to follow. This video did an excellent job at it.",5,Excellent Video!,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,782,"['video', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'watched', 'series', 'have', '13', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'one', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'Jonah', 'Whale', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'did', 'add', 'storyline', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'bible', 'did', ""n't"", 'step', 'out', 'bounds', 'did', 'not', 'contradict', 'scripture', 'looked', 'really', 'searched', 'out', 'historically', 'make', 'better', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'rest', 'series.One', 'thing', 'will', 'notice', 'video', 'most', 'children', 'bible', 'videos', 'not', 'corny', ""n't"", 'make', 'characters', 'out', 'be', 'silly', 'goofballs', 'feel', 'very', 'important', 'children', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'examples', 'follow', 'video', 'did', 'excellent', 'job']",N/A

739614,A1C6YIPDQ96RHV,B00008DDW2,James D. Madden,"[7, 7]","This DVD production of the story of Jonah has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, recognizing there can be consequences for our sin (aka disobedience for my son), and seeing the Lord will forgive us once we recognize our wrongdoing and repent.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Jonah.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, recognizing there can be consequences for our sin (aka disobedience for my son), and seeing the Lord will forgive us once we recognize our wrongdoing and repent.",5,Inspiring Interest in  Future Believers,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1243,"['DVD', 'production', 'story', 'Jonah', 'accomplished', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', '3yr', 'old', 'son', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'involvement', 'lives', 'who', 'trust', 'Him', 'recognizing', 'can', 'be', 'consequences', 'sin', 'aka', 'disobedience', 'son', 'seeing', 'Lord', 'will', 'forgive', 'once', 'recognize', 'wrongdoing', 'repent', 'son', 'often', 'surprising', 'detail', 'various', 'scenes', 'tale', 'One', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'Christ', 'calls', 'son', 'Little', 'Preacher', 'son', 'capturing', 'attention', 'so', 'can', 'retell', 'story', 'Jonah', 'understand', 'reviewing', 'telling', 'story', 'may', 'prefer', 'stricter', 'adherence', 'various', 'nuances', 'literary', 'exactness', 'Scripture', 'can', 'appreciate', 'am', 'literal', 'believer', 'Scripture', 'never', 'perfect', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'preference', 'already', 'mentioned', 'achieved', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'son', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'involvement', 'lives', 'who', 'trust', 'Him', 'recognizing', 'can', 'be', 'consequences', 'sin', 'aka', 'disobedience', 'son', 'seeing', 'Lord', 'will', 'forgive', 'once', 'recognize', 'wrongdoing', 'repent']",N/A

739617,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B00008DDW2,microjoe,"[2, 2]","Greatest Heroes in an interesting series of animated programs, all include an introduction by Charlton Heston on the story we are about to see. The animation is good quality, full hand drawn 2D cel animation without shortcuts. In the middle of each episode in this series, they usually have a cutaway of another story from the bible, done in computer animation to contrast the two stories. The story of Jonah is a good pick to animate, due to the large fish or whale that swallows him, as that is what kids remember of the story and it is a good way to get them to view it.This is not my favorite depiction of Jonah, as I prefer the ""Testament: Bible in Animation"" version of Jonah. Having said that we did enjoy this, especially the kids. All versions stray from the source material and are not accurate, as they balance what will make a story flow for the viewer, especially kids. In this ""Greatest Heroes"" version, Jonah is very young, perhaps to relate to kids more. What we do get here that many versions do not explain well enough, is why Jonah despised Ninevah so much... They were attacking his people all the time. Overall it is geared toward the younger crowd, great moral lessons here, and if you have issues about the changes from scripture, always discuss the differences afterwords to your kids as we did. No extras on the DVD, sound and picture quality were good, no problems with playing the disc or the menu. I recommend buying this DVD.",5,Good for the kids,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,1454,"['Greatest', 'Heroes', 'interesting', 'series', 'animated', 'programs', 'include', 'introduction', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'story', 'are', 'see', 'animation', 'good', 'quality', 'full', 'hand', 'drawn', '2D', 'cel', 'animation', 'shortcuts', 'middle', 'episode', 'series', 'usually', 'have', 'cutaway', 'story', 'bible', 'done', 'computer', 'animation', 'contrast', 'two', 'stories', 'story', 'Jonah', 'good', 'pick', 'animate', 'due', 'large', 'fish', 'whale', 'what', 'remember', 'story', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'view', 'it.This', 'not', 'favorite', 'depiction', 'Jonah', 'prefer', 'Testament', 'Bible', 'Animation', 'version', 'Jonah', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'kids', 'versions', 'stray', 'source', 'material', 'are', 'not', 'accurate', 'balance', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'story', 'flow', 'viewer', 'especially', 'kids', 'Greatest', 'Heroes', 'version', 'Jonah', 'very', 'young', 'perhaps', 'relate', 'kids', 'more', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'here', 'many', 'versions', 'do', 'not', 'explain', 'well', 'enough', 'why', 'Jonah', 'despised', 'Ninevah', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'attacking', 'people', 'time', 'Overall', 'geared', 'younger', 'crowd', 'great', 'moral', 'lessons', 'here', 'have', 'issues', 'changes', 'scripture', 'always', 'discuss', 'differences', 'afterwords', 'kids', 'did', 'extras', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'were', 'good', 'problems', 'playing', 'disc', 'menu', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
