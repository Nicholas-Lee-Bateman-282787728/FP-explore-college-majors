The plot is standard fare, that old gambit about second chances.  A grumpy hardware store owner (Fred MacMurray as Charley Appleby), is made to see the error of his ways by a secular version of an angel (Harry Morgan).  There are a number of near misses before Charley is told his number is up (quaint terminology for death is a-knockin').  At this point, is the angel a messenger or the grim reaper?  Considering the sheer number of visitations, I'd say he was trying to hound poor Appleby to death.  From start to last, this is lightweight comedy at best, ordinary melodrama at worst.  Everything about this tepid offering is lackluster, even the dingy FX used to materialize the angel or send him off in a series of twinkling cartoony stars.  Of the cast, only Cloris Leachman does anything of merit with the anemic material (she was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress for this role).  She's the only reason I bought this movie but it's not enough of a reason for me to keep it for future viewings.

Since he started out so poor, he is relentless in his discipline to work hard and keep his business afloat. Even though he loves his family, he has neglected to spend enough quality time with them. His sons are especially hurt with him, and spend more time with other kids dads. One day his guardian angel shows up and lets him know his time is up, and Charley realizes he is leaving without making things right at home. But is his family too distant for him to do this? In the meantime he keeps trying to survive accidents intended to send him off. Will he mend things before he leaves? A series of mad-cap events involving his sons unknowingly transporting bootleg liquor, a prohibition era road house of ill repute, gangsters, police chases, a kidnapping, and more give him the chance to be a hero to his family.BEHIND THE SCENES: Released theatrically in 1973, this was the last acting role for Fred MacMurray before his retirement. He had appeared in a number of movies for Disney, who had pulled him out of his first retirement to appear in the 1959 comedy ""The Shaggy Dog"". Fred did a total of 7 movies for Disney, and later recieved the Disney Legend award in 1987, as the first-ever recipient of this now famous award.Cloris Leachman plays the part of Charley's  wife, Harry Morgan is great the angel, and Disney regular Kurt Russell pursues Charley's daughter against her fathers wishes. Great special effects of the angel and his powers. Long time Disney Studios set decorator/designer Emil Kuri gave the sets especially the general store an authentic period look. Accurate costuming and antique cars also lent to the period air. Most effective perhaps is the music score from Disney staff composer Buddy Baker, who incorporates many classic songs from the depression era. All the period touches blend together effectively for a very charming atmosphere, featuring a period in American history not covered enough in film. Walt Disney had passed away several years before this release, but he would have connected to the film having grown up in the depression. This movie aired later on the Disney television show in 1977, then first released on video in 1986. As of 2010 it has never been released again on video or DVD, making it quite rare. I recommend this movie if you have never seen it, its hilarious and touching at once, with some action and chase scenes, this period film is a little gem.",5,Nice period film set in the depression,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2502,"['STORY', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Charley', 'Appleby', 'hard', 'working', 'small-town', 'businessman', 'started', 'out', 'so', 'poor', 'relentless', 'discipline', 'work', 'hard', 'keep', 'business', 'afloat', 'Even', 'family', 'neglected', 'spend', 'enough', 'quality', 'time', 'sons', 'are', 'especially', 'hurt', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'other', 'kids', 'dads', 'One', 'day', 'guardian', 'angel', 'up', 'know', 'time', 'up', 'Charley', 'leaving', 'making', 'things', 'right', 'home', 'family', 'too', 'distant', 'do', 'meantime', 'trying', 'survive', 'accidents', 'intended', 'send', 'off', 'Will', 'mend', 'things', 'A', 'series', 'mad-cap', 'events', 'involving', 'sons', 'unknowingly', 'transporting', 'bootleg', 'liquor', 'prohibition', 'era', 'road', 'house', 'ill', 'repute', 'gangsters', 'police', 'chases', 'kidnapping', 'more', 'give', 'chance', 'be', 'hero', 'family.BEHIND', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'Released', 'theatrically', '1973', 'was', 'last', 'acting', 'role', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'retirement', 'had', 'appeared', 'number', 'movies', 'Disney', 'who', 'had', 'pulled', 'first', 'retirement', 'appear', '1959', 'comedy', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'Fred', 'did', 'total', '7', 'movies', 'Disney', 'later', 'recieved', 'Disney', 'Legend', 'award', '1987', 'first-ever', 'recipient', 'now', 'famous', 'award.Cloris', 'Leachman', 'part', 'Charley', 'wife', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'great', 'angel', 'Disney', 'regular', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Charley', 'daughter', 'fathers', 'wishes', 'Great', 'special', 'effects', 'angel', 'powers', 'Long', 'time', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'set', 'decorator/designer', 'Emil', 'Kuri', 'gave', 'sets', 'especially', 'general', 'store', 'authentic', 'period', 'look', 'Accurate', 'costuming', 'antique', 'cars', 'also', 'lent', 'period', 'air', 'Most', 'effective', 'perhaps', 'music', 'score', 'Disney', 'staff', 'composer', 'Buddy', 'Baker', 'who', 'many', 'classic', 'songs', 'depression', 'era', 'period', 'touches', 'blend', 'together', 'effectively', 'very', 'charming', 'atmosphere', 'featuring', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'not', 'covered', 'enough', 'film', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'several', 'years', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'connected', 'film', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'depression', 'movie', 'aired', 'later', 'Disney', 'television', 'show', '1977', 'then', 'first', 'released', 'video', '1986', '2010', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'again', 'video', 'DVD', 'making', 'quite', 'rare', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'once', 'action', 'chase', 'scenes', 'period', 'film', 'little', 'gem']",N/A
