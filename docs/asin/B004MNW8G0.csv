Forced to say one good thing about the movie, I would note that the lead actress is physically stunning.  The CGI barely rose to the level of last-generation video games.  The only thing that kept me watching is the fact that (for the DVD) the English subtitles (I have a hearing deficit) were for a DIFFERENT MOVIE.  In fact, for one of the movies that was advertised in a trailer before the feature.  The pairing--or juxtaposition--of the images in ""Hisss"" and the dialog from the other movie made for some very funny moments.  If it hadn't been for that stupid mistake on the part of the DVD producer, ""Hisss"" would have been truly unwatchable.  So perhaps it was intentional after all.",1,"Awful, except for one hilarious mistake.",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,731,"['Hisss', 'was', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'expected', 'Forced', 'say', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'would', 'note', 'lead', 'actress', 'physically', 'stunning', 'CGI', 'barely', 'rose', 'level', 'last-generation', 'video', 'games', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'fact', 'DVD', 'English', 'subtitles', 'have', 'hearing', 'deficit', 'were', 'DIFFERENT', 'MOVIE', 'fact', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'advertised', 'trailer', 'feature', 'pairing', 'juxtaposition', 'images', 'Hisss', 'dialog', 'other', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'stupid', 'mistake', 'part', 'DVD', 'producer', 'Hisss', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'unwatchable', 'So', 'perhaps', 'was', 'intentional']",N/A

It had no story that makes sense; the worst acting; even worse special CGI and fake rubber snake effects (comparable to the 70s). This is a FF movie. The only moments that may capture some attention, and they were brief, is seeing snake woman as an attractive human actress.Storyline: Takes place in India. Snake, with laughable CGI effects, turns into a woman who journeys to find her snake boyfriend who was stolen by a stereotypic fat greedy American and on the way fangs a couple of bad people.

I thought the movie was pretty cool, and the symbolic undertones were quirky. The acting wasn't that bad and overall I think it is a cool horror movie. A movie that has a hot chick eat a guy and defecate him out and later has an erotic scene with a reptile, hey how could that be bad? This movie strayed from the norm and I both like and respect that.

I know India's bollywood produce way more pictures than American studio's, but 1) they do not know how to produce a good movie or 2) their tastes are very far removed than other cultures.The CGI was OK. Sci-Fi channel OK. The lead actress, Mallika Sherawat, was absolutely stunning. Bad actress, but amazingly beautiful.The other actors were OK, but still pretty flat. The directing and editing was horrendous. Long, long shots that should have been edited down. Very little dialogue (and in hindsight, that's a good thing). The story was, well I guess, a myth India is familiar with and make many assumptions for the viewer. Many times I had no idea what was going on or why. I am absolutely blown away, this had a bollywood dance scene thrown in. Why? I have no ****ing idea. Just a filler and weird.

1420078,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004MNW8G0,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I was interested in checking out 2010's ""Hisss"" mainly because it's an East Indian horror production (""Bollywood"") and I've never seen an Indian horror flick. The plot has to do with a Hindu snake god coming to life in the form of a beautiful Indian woman (Mallika Sherawat) and preying upon the dastardly inhabitants of the slum city. A detective tries to solve the case (Irrfan Khan).As noted in my title blurb, this is a gruesome movie but it's not really scary, at least not to me. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have points of interest. The first act features a dynamic sequence at a painting festival on the streets and it's so energetic and creative that it possesses a ""Wow"" factor, sort of like the innovative dancing scenes in ""The Day the Fish Came Out"" (1967). Later there's a cool chase thru the village (on foot) between the snake woman and a snake charmer with the detective tagging along. There are some other flashes of genius.Of course Mallika Sherawat is a gorgeous woman, Indian or otherwise, and she's featured in numerous stages of dress or undress, but it's Maya Gupta, as the detective's wife, whose beauty truly shines here, and she's fully clothed at all times (what's that tell ya?).The film was shot in various areas of India (West coast, East coast, South-Central, etc.) and is a visual feast of India in all its glory or disgrace. The movie's interesting in this regard.Another highlight is the score & soundtrack. Take, for instance, the compelling and rockin' score during the foot chase.I also thought the effects were pretty well done. For instance, when the snake woman morphs into a half-snake, half-woman monster at the end it brought to mind Lin Carter's Thongor comics from the early 70s.Unfortunately, the story's not all that compelling despite the occasional bursts of brilliance. It's also too gruesome for my tastes -- loads of gore and worse -- albeit nothing I can't handle. Plus the detective's stepmother is really annoying (but maybe that's the point).The film runs 98 minutes.GRADE: B-",4,"Grisly, but not scary, with flashes of brilliance",1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,2037,"['was', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', '2010', 'Hisss', 'mainly', 'East', 'Indian', 'horror', 'production', 'Bollywood', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Indian', 'horror', 'flick', 'plot', 'do', 'Hindu', 'snake', 'god', 'coming', 'life', 'form', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'woman', 'Mallika', 'Sherawat', 'preying', 'dastardly', 'inhabitants', 'slum', 'city', 'detective', 'tries', 'solve', 'case', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', '.As', 'noted', 'title', 'blurb', 'gruesome', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'least', 'not', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'points', 'interest', 'first', 'act', 'dynamic', 'sequence', 'painting', 'festival', 'streets', 'so', 'energetic', 'creative', 'Wow', 'factor', 'sort', 'innovative', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'Day', 'Fish', 'Came', 'Out', '1967', 'Later', 'cool', 'chase', 'thru', 'village', 'foot', 'snake', 'woman', 'snake', 'charmer', 'detective', 'tagging', 'along', 'are', 'other', 'flashes', 'genius.Of', 'course', 'Mallika', 'Sherawat', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'Indian', 'otherwise', 'featured', 'numerous', 'stages', 'dress', 'undress', 'Maya', 'Gupta', 'detective', 'wife', 'beauty', 'truly', 'shines', 'here', 'fully', 'clothed', 'times', 'what', 'tell', 'ya', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'various', 'areas', 'India', 'West', 'coast', 'East', 'coast', 'South-Central', 'etc', 'visual', 'feast', 'India', 'glory', 'disgrace', 'movie', 'interesting', 'regard.Another', 'highlight', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'Take', 'instance', 'compelling', 'rockin', 'score', 'foot', 'chase.I', 'also', 'thought', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'instance', 'when', 'snake', 'woman', 'half-snake', 'half-woman', 'monster', 'end', 'brought', 'mind', 'Lin', 'Carter', 'Thongor', 'comics', 'early', '70s.Unfortunately', 'story', 'not', 'compelling', 'occasional', 'bursts', 'brilliance', 'also', 'too', 'gruesome', 'tastes', 'loads', 'gore', 'worse', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'detective', 'stepmother', 'really', 'annoying', 'maybe', 'point', '.The', 'film', '98', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
