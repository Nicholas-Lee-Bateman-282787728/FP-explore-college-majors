I had a passing knowledge of the Philadelphia experiment so this filled a lot of the holes in my knowledge. Not sure what to believe, but it was a cool ride.",4,Killer 3 dvd set,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,216,"['was', 'really', 'stoked', 'get', 'birthday', 'year', 'had', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'Philadelphia', 'experiment', 'so', 'filled', 'lot', 'holes', 'knowledge', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'believe', 'was', 'cool', 'ride']",The Philadelphia Experiment Revealed: Final Countdown To Disclosure From The Area 51 Archi
1531216,A25JSZ7XF3KG92,B007I1TGQI,"B. Hauser ""B. Hauser""","[5, 5]","These 3 DVDs contain two extensive lectures and a long, casual conversation by Al Bielek (often spelled Beilek), who claims to be a survivor of the Philadelphia Experiment, a purported successful time-travel test that has been covered up ever since.  In the world of unexplained phenomena, The Philadelphia Experiment and its cousins, The Phoenix and Montauk Projects, could be the most fascinating of them all.  Beilek himself is difficult to disbelieve.  He seems like a reluctant witness, with nothing to gain by lying, and he's the last person you'd expect would be delusional.  Then again, what he's saying really rocks our view of reality.  Preston Nichols joins in, explaining the Montauk project, purportedly a method of amplifying psychic thoughts, turning what look like vacuum tube ham radios into sentient beings!  Of course the US government doesn't want us to know they have this capability, but then again, how come we've been bogged down in so many decades-long wars if our military controls time and space?  The third DVD is a comprehensive documentary on the subject--if this is all new to you, start with DVD 3, then go to 1, then skip 2 (unless you're a physicist).

1531217,A3FA9MUYT5D2C8,B007I1TGQI,"Elaine ""Bookish in California""","[1, 2]","Science or science fiction? This creepy and fascinating documentary claims that two government experiments, The Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk Project were later combined into a secret third project known as the Phoenix Project that involved walk-in implantation, time travel, mind control, invisibility, mind machines used to develop and control paranormal powers and torturous other things.

Years ago I had seen a documentary on this subject and it was very interesting, this however was so poorly done, low budget and if you don't have multiple degrees in Physics you can't follow the point or points they are trying to get across. I have never been so disappointed in anything. I do NOT recommend this video, not even to the die hard enthusiasts, in my opinion it's awful!!!!!!!",1,Really??????,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,458,"['was', 'high', 'hopes', 'quality', 'video', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'Years', 'had', 'seen', 'documentary', 'subject', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'however', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'multiple', 'degrees', 'Physics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'point', 'points', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'disappointed', 'anything', 'do', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'video', 'not', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'enthusiasts', 'opinion', 'awful']",The Philadelphia Experiment Revealed: Final Countdown To Disclosure From The Area 51 Archi
