Be that as it may: 1st 1 on this Disc is 1 of my Favorites: Ridin' Route 66 (featuring Angel the Barber in AZ). I've visited him many a time. Always so sweet & kind. We need MORE folks like him. Anyway: there are 16 Episodes on these 2 discs ending with Hot & Salty. We admire how Rick & Company can turn a pile of stuff into a work of art!
