1696999,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00K2CHUPY,,"[5, 13]","When Tim Burton undertook his first Broadway-musical movie adaptation in 2007, with &#8220;Sweeney Todd,&#8221; he adapted the beloved material like there was nothing to it. Some of the score was cut, but it still made for a great movie. When it was announced that Clint Eastwood, more famous for traditional Hollywood melodramas like &#8220;Million Dollar Baby&#8221; and &#8220;The Bridges of Madison County,&#8221; was planning to direct the feature adaptation of the hit jukebox musical &#8220;Jersey Boys,&#8221; people, including myself, were skeptical. Then the trailer came out, and it all looked like it might come together.It didn&#8217;t. Eastwood&#8217;s visual style is all wrong for a flashy musical like this. The trailer suggested that this was going to be some kind of musical &#8220;Goodfellas,&#8221; and even that seemed kind of interesting. It didn&#8217;t work as that movie either. Eastwood made the right call in casting John Lloyd Young in the role of Frankie Valli, an obvious choice, since he made the role work on Broadway. Eastwood also used a slew of other actors from the original company. In theory, this film should&#8217;ve worked. I&#8217;m disappointed to say that it was dead on arrival.Onstage, &#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221; isn&#8217;t unlike other rise-to-fame musicals like &#8220;Dreamgirls&#8221; and &#8220;Chicago.&#8221; It&#8217;s flashy, ridiculous, but monstrously entertaining. It follows the story of Frankie Valli, and the Four Seasons. Unfortunately, what we have here is a biopic and not a musical. A good half of the score is cut entirely, and we only seldom see a musical performance from beginning to end. Eastwood feels like a slave to the biopic rise-then-fall formula, and robs the source material of most of its fun and jauntiness. Just about every showbiz clich&eacute; is here, and Eastwood doesn&#8217;t seem interested in doing anything we haven&#8217;t seen before.Eastwood has a distinct visual style &#8211; every scene feels dark and gloomy, which is totally wrong for this kind of movie. The actors seem listless and uninterested, as to say &#8220;we&#8217;re singing these stupid songs again?&#8221; The energy that is usually present in a film adaptation of a musical is nowhere to be found here, and most of the characters seem unsympathetic and hard to like. Since so much extra time is used building what passes for a plot, you would think someone would have realized that the characters need to be characters &#8211; not caricatures.The bright spots in this film, if there are any, come from the musical moments. Otherwise energetic musical numbers are broken up by characters talking directly to the camera, as to spell out plot points for the audience that is apparently too dumb to follow the story. This is one storytelling device that worked onstage, but makes for awkward cinema.The one thing, however, that Eastwood got absolutely right is the closing credits. It&#8217;s an old-fashioned Broadway-esque curtain call, where the cast dances and participates in a great musical number, the kind this film should&#8217;ve been filled with. In fact, the last half hour or so of the film is fairly good, but it took a good 90 minutes for it to come to life, when it should have popped off the screen after the opening credits rolled.Grade: C-",2,Eastwood was the wrong choice to adapt this glitzy and fun play...,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,3316,"['When', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'undertook', 'first', 'Broadway-musical', 'movie', 'adaptation', '2007', '8220', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', '8221', 'adapted', 'beloved', 'material', 'was', 'nothing', 'score', 'was', 'cut', 'still', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'famous', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'melodramas', '8220', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', '8221', '8220', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', '8221', 'was', 'planning', 'direct', 'feature', 'adaptation', 'hit', 'jukebox', 'musical', '8220', 'Jersey', 'Boys', '8221', 'people', 'including', 'were', 'skeptical', 'Then', 'trailer', 'came', 'out', 'looked', 'might', 'come', 'together.It', 'didn', '8217', 'Eastwood', '8217', 's', 'visual', 'style', 'wrong', 'flashy', 'musical', 'trailer', 'suggested', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'kind', 'musical', '8220', 'Goodfellas', '8221', 'even', 'seemed', 'kind', 'interesting', '8217', 't', 'work', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'right', 'call', 'casting', 'John', 'Lloyd', 'Young', 'role', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'obvious', 'choice', 'made', 'role', 'work', 'Broadway', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'used', 'slew', 'other', 'actors', 'original', 'company', 'theory', 'film', 'should', '8217', 've', 'worked', '8217', 'disappointed', 'say', 'was', 'dead', 'arrival.Onstage', '8220', 'Jersey', 'Boys', '8221', '8217', 'other', 'rise-to-fame', 'musicals', '8220', 'Dreamgirls', '8221', '8220', 'Chicago.', '8221', '8217', 'flashy', 'ridiculous', 'monstrously', 'entertaining', 'story', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'biopic', 'not', 'musical', 'good', 'half', 'score', 'cut', 'entirely', 'only', 'seldom', 'see', 'musical', 'performance', 'beginning', 'end', 'Eastwood', 'feels', 'slave', 'biopic', 'rise-then-fall', 'formula', 'robs', 'source', 'material', 'most', 'fun', 'jauntiness', 'Just', 'showbiz', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'Eastwood', 'doesn', '8217', 'seem', 'interested', 'doing', 'anything', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'before.Eastwood', 'distinct', 'visual', 'style', '8211', 'scene', 'feels', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'totally', 'wrong', 'kind', 'movie', 'actors', 'seem', 'listless', 'uninterested', 'say', '8220', '8217', 're', 'singing', 'stupid', 'songs', 'again', '8221', 'energy', 'usually', 'present', 'film', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'most', 'characters', 'seem', 'unsympathetic', 'hard', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'extra', 'time', 'used', 'building', 'what', 'plot', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'characters', 'need', 'be', 'characters', '8211', 'not', 'caricatures.The', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'are', 'come', 'musical', 'moments', 'Otherwise', 'energetic', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'broken', 'up', 'characters', 'talking', 'directly', 'camera', 'spell', 'out', 'plot', 'points', 'audience', 'apparently', 'too', 'dumb', 'follow', 'story', 'one', 'storytelling', 'device', 'worked', 'onstage', 'awkward', 'cinema.The', 'one', 'thing', 'however', 'Eastwood', 'got', 'absolutely', 'right', 'closing', 'credits', '8217', 's', 'old-fashioned', 'Broadway-esque', 'curtain', 'call', 'where', 'cast', 'dances', 'participates', 'great', 'musical', 'number', 'kind', 'film', 'should', '8217', 'been', 'filled', 'fact', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'took', 'good', '90', 'minutes', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'popped', 'off', 'screen', 'opening', 'credits', 'rolled.Grade', 'C-']",N/A

What the show had going for it, though, was tremendous energy and a glitzy, somewhat cheesy charm.  And the music, of course.  What makes the film version such a letdown is its literalness.  Director Clint Eastwood has taken a Broadway musical and turned it into a rather dreary biopic with the occasional song.  The film should soar as soon as the singing starts, but it just sits there.  What the material needed was a Rob Marshall or Martin Scorsese, someone who knows how to energize an audience and whip up some excitement with a distinct visual style.  This film has no style whatsoever, no point of view.  Eastwood turned on the camera and let the actors do what they do.  Okay, there's a little bit more to it than that, but it's a pretty dull affair.  John Lloyd Young is, unfortunately, a large part of the problem.  On stage he was electric, but here he's a cipher.  The other three Seasons are much better, particularly Vincent Piazza, who's like a lightning bolt among fireflies.

1697004,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B00K2CHUPY,janebbooks,"[4, 4]","When Francesco Stephen Castelluccio stepped on the stage in Washington, DC a few days ago at the Capitol Fourth celebration of the Fourth of July, he needed no introduction.  Shrugging his shoulders and snapping his fingers, he took the mike and began to sing! It was the still strong falsetto voice...the voice of Frankie Valli, the lead singer of the Four Seasons.In the eight years since the Broadway play of JERSEY BOYS won four Tony Awards including Best Musical, it's been hard to ignore the revival of the Four Seasons' many hits nor the mounting praise for the story of their rise from obscure local band to rock `n' roll sensation. Long before JERSEY BOYS reached its 3487th Broadway performance on April 9, 2014, a movie seemed in the works.  Warner Brothers dropped the project but Graham King of GK Films acquired the rights and picked Clint Eastwood to direct.JERSEY BOYS, the film released on June 20, 2014, tells the story of the rise of The Four Seasons, an American rock and pop singing group, that was formed by three juvenile delinquents: Frankie Valli (Francesco Stephen Castelluccio), the lead singer, Nick Massi, bass guitar and vocals, and Tommy DeVito, lead guitar and baritone vocals,  who grew up around Newark, New Jersey in the 1950s. Bob Gaudio, a fellow from the Bronx formerly of the Royal Teens, joined the group in 1960 as tenor vocal on keyboards and wrote most of their early hit songs.The movie is well cast.  John Lloyd Young, the Tony winner and original Broadway cast member, reprises his role as Valli.  Erich Bergen as Gaudio, Michael Lomenda as Massi, and Vincent Piazza as DeVito round out the other Four Seasons nicely.  The real life character of Gyp Decarlo is played by Christopher Walken.  Decarlo was a mob boss that had ties to The Four Seasons via Tommy DeVito who helped the group when Tommy racked up a significant amount of debts by mediating their negotiations with a loan shark.  Decarlo also, in the movie, tears up when he listens to Valli singing his first single, ""My Mother's Eyes"" (1953).It's an American story, folks, this movie about the JERSEY BOYS.  It's the story of four American-born young men who achieved the American Dream.  And they did it on the Ed Sullivan show before that strange group of guys in funny hairdos from across the pond did it.You'll come out of the theater humming those jukebox songs like ""Sherry""...""December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)""...""My Eyes Adored You""...""Can't Take My Eyes Off You""...""Working My Way Back to You"" and ""Rag Doll.""

Well.... After seeing the stage productions of &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; many times (Seattle, Tampa, London and New York), this sets me up for a fall. This is a four-person biography with occasional songs which has been drawn from a stage musical. What we do NOT see is the musicality, the theatricality and the immediacy of the stage version. I wanted joyful exuberance.Bless Clint Eastwood for trying. He attended stage versions of this theatrical biography of &#34;Frankie Valle and the Four Seasons,&#34; aka &#34;Jersey Boys,&#34; which thrilled the professionals. He selected players from those versions, even though their characters' stories are diluted and stretched out in this 134 minute R-rated (language) ramble. What we see is hardscrabble beginnings, meteoric (ten long years) rise to fame, then the downside, which can best be done by a director who has first-hand experience.We have:* John Lloyd Young (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34; - 2006 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Broadway musical) as Frankie Valle, a young barber trainee who wants out of Jersey. He is bullied and dominated by a &#34;friend,&#34; Tommy DeVito, who is forming a musical group.* Vincent Piazza (&#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34;) as Tommy DeVito, who revels in his creation, changes the course of American musical history...and never lets anyone forget it! In MY opinion, this guy is a cocky, amoral sociopath, and too much screen time is wasted on his youthful crimes.* Erich Bergen (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34; Las Vegas cast) as Bob Gaudio, the brilliant songwriter who heard Valli and thought, &#34;I could write for THAT voice!&#34; (His parents wanted him to go to trade school.)* Michael Lomenda (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34;) as Nick Massi, the &#34;forgotten one&#34; (he's the Ringo of this quartet). He couldn't STAND being DeVito's roommate: &#34;The man is an ANIMAL!&#34;* Joseph Russo (&#34;It's Not You, It's Me&#34;) is Joe &#34;Joey&#34; Pesci. Yup, THAT Joe Pesci. He introduced Gaudio to Valli.* Christopher Walken (&#34;Seven Psychopaths&#34;) is Angelo &#34;Gyp&#34; DeCarlo, the mobster who hears Frankie sing &#34;My Mother's Eyes&#34; and is a loyal Valli fan from the get go.* Mike Doyle (Lots of TV) as producer Bob Crewe, a &#34;theatrical&#34; fellow who helps launch the group; he understands the business side of the music business.I take serious issue with the music. I hope the copy I saw was at fault, because the balance was waaaay off and the horn section was simply a cacophony which ruined &#34;You're Just Too Good To Be True.&#34; Other selections were off balance, badly mixed and too stylized; most songs become stylized after they have been hits for awhile. &#34;Who Wears Short Shorts&#34; was so stylized in the early scenes, I wouldn't have recognized it if I hadn't known it was there. (Bob Gaudio wrote his first hit song when he was 15 years old, but this isn't mentioned here; he was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 1995.)BTW, I purchased the book &#34;Places Please&#34; by Daniel Robert Sullivan which is based on his torturous journey to play Tommy DeVito in the Toronto show. It is a great insider's look at the demands made on performers who desperately want to be cast; it describes the hard work and the meticulous choreography involved in the stage versions of &#34;Jersey Boys.&#34;If you haven't been spoiled by the stage version, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this interesting story, interspersed with well-known songs that are part of the fabric of our lives.

For me, that makes a movie really &#34;good&#34;.And, although I hate people who pontificate in reviews, that's what I'm gonna do.Film and stage are two very different animals.  Anyone who's watched a filmed or taped live performance knows this.  Even when the staging and performance is exactly the same as would have been seen 'live', it isn't the same.  Deal with it.The fewer expectations you carry to any work of art (and I'm one of those Yahoos who thinks all films, even the most commercial, have an element of 'art' and 'artistry' to them) the more you will enjoy what you see and the fairer (is there such a word???) you will be to the creative people who labored to entertain or enlighten you.  Get an idea of the plot, if you must, and whether you should be laughing or crying by the end, and open yourself up to just enjoy what you get.It'll be hard enough to get what you want even then but you'll get it more often.  In other words, give yourself permission to be pleased.  Makes life and films much more satisfying.That being said, it was an entertaining film, made even more so because I remember every silly thing my friends and I were doing when we heard those songs for the first time.  The film chose to land on the side of how it sort-of-really-was rather than a glitzy performance of what it should have been.  Even so, mobsters have heart, debts are repaid, family collapses are survived, and we all are friends again in the end.  Maybe it is as fantastical as a glitzy Broadway production but the music makes it work.If you want to see Broadway, you're right, go to Broadway.  But  since I live in the Heartland, a thousand and more miles west of the Midwest (where I grew up) and just as far east of the sea and sun, I'll take good films whenever I can get one.This is a good film!",4,I liked it.

Radio stations in that era were mostly music, and you couldn't listen to a rock station for more than a few minutes without hearing the Four Seasons. Fast forward to the 2005 Broadway version of Jersey Boys and the 2014 film version. I haven't seen the stage show, but my wife and I saw the movie at the theater, and we both loved it. At the time the Four Seasons were so successful, few people knew anything about the personal problems they had, or the fact that some group members had arrest records and had done jail time. In that era, there weren't many paparazzi or tabloids to hound personalities and expose every detail of their lives. Jersey Boys brings out these issues, and how accurate the account is, I don't know, but it's a very entertaining movie, with a lot of the Four Seasons biggest hit songs sung very capably by the actors who played the group members, led by John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli (Young had already won a Tony Award for the same role in the Broadway version). And it's always great to see Christopher Walken, who was super as Angelo &#34;Gyp&#34; DeCarlo, a mob boss who took an interest in the group.I know that a lot of the facts in the film were incorrect, but the film got one thing right - partly. The group did choose the name &#34;Four Seasons&#34; from the name of a bowling alley lounge, but they had just failed an audition for the lounge, not been kicked out as the film depicted.And don't even think about leaving when the lights come on and the credits start rolling.

1697010,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B00K2CHUPY,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[0, 2]","What do you call a movie that's based on a smash Broadway musical--and half the songs have been thrown out?A Clint Eastwood movie.Eastwood is an Academy Award winning director--whose made brilliant character studies in such gems as ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino."" His best work features characters that are flawed, oft times tortured.So when I read that he was in charge of ""Jersey Boys,"" a wildly popular, Emmy-winning stage musical that's been lauded both in big American cities and in travelng companies around the world, I thought; well, at least this will be interesting.Brave is the movie maker who takes on a project that's loaded with infectious pop tunes from the sixties since this production is all about how Frankie Valli and the  Four Seasons rose to international fame with such toe-tapping tunes as ""Walk Like a Man,"" ""Rag Doll,"" ""Sherry.""For every movie musical that turned into box bonanzas like the wonderful, 'The Sound of Music,"" and ""Mama Mia,"" you've got mega-bombs like ""Phantom of the Opera,' ""Les Miserables"" and especially the ghastly ""The Producers"" and the truly hideous, ""Rent.""Eastwood photographs ""Jersey Boys"" in a dim, washed-out style, not a very promising ingredient for a fun and fascinating musical bio of a singing team. There's no color to be seen. Everything is dark brown, black, shadowy so it suggests we're watching a grim dramatic story of stunted personalities.None of the cast members seem to be having a good time. There's nothing joyous or witty about them. When the group finally performs one of their hit tunes, one singer breaks the fourth wall of narrative to speak directly to the camera to explain some plot element that only adds nothing to our boredom. You can't enjoy the musical number because you're trying to understand what the actor is saying to us.The story begins as we watch the evolution of the Jersey Boys from stealing safes, crashing cars and going to prison--as if they were going to a high school dance. Then we watch them begin to meet the shady characters of the underworld, with one of the singers dealing with drugs.We watch the boys finally connect but even here, we are short-changed any delightful vocalizing. We watch them rehearse in a casual manner. AS the minutes drag on, we realize that there is no music. Eastwood is determined to pack on the backstory and character development.The result is a boring retread of every tough-boy-grows-up-on-the mean streets, from James Cagney in ""Public Enemy"" in 1931 through ""Mean Streets,"" ""Good Fellas"" and ""The Godfather."" We've seen this all so many times and in so many incarnations on both movies and TV that we know exactly what to expect. You certainly don't expect to see this blandness in a supposedly joyful musical.We then spend more, long minutes as Frankie Valli marries a beautiful, feisty Italian girl but later in the movie we abruptly encounter her again and she's become a shrieking, drunken shrew and resembles some reject from the Real Housewives of New Jersey.Well, we think, at least that's over, and now maybe some music. But wait--we now have Valli's daughter running away from home and being tracked down in NYC and we discover she feels rejected by her famous parent and she wants a musical career of her own. This very long sequence goes nowhere. The daughter makes this sudden appearance out of nowhere and then vanishes from the story.Whew, thank the Lord, that's over with. But then comes a rather hysterical episode where our aging singers are now inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. Since they're now aging crooners, they're padded and bulky and walk real slow and wear wigs that you'd find in a Halloween Costume shop.And then, at the end, it's like someone's nudged Eastwood and reminds him that this is a musical so we have the entire cast suddenly appear and dance maniacally and grinning and freeze now and the to the tune of ""Oh, What a Night!""This sudden musical number shocks--because this is what the audience has been waiting for for the past two hours.Let's be grateful Eastwood doesn't get his hands on a remake of the masterpiece, ""The Sound of Music."" We'd probably be seeing Julie Andrew swirling around on a hilltop, machine gun in hand, while singing: ""Du Hills Are Alife--with du sound of mu-zak!""",2,It Coulda Been a Contendah,1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,4303,"['What', 'do', 'call', 'movie', 'based', 'smash', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie.Eastwood', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'director', 'made', 'brilliant', 'character', 'studies', 'such', 'gems', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'best', 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'oft', 'times', 'tortured.So', 'when', 'read', 'was', 'charge', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Emmy-winning', 'stage', 'musical', 'been', 'lauded', 'big', 'American', 'cities', 'travelng', 'companies', 'world', 'thought', 'well', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'interesting.Brave', 'movie', 'maker', 'who', 'project', 'loaded', 'infectious', 'pop', 'tunes', 'sixties', 'production', 'how', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'rose', 'international', 'fame', 'such', 'toe-tapping', 'tunes', 'Walk', 'Man', 'Rag', 'Doll', 'Sherry', 'movie', 'musical', 'turned', 'box', 'bonanzas', 'wonderful', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Mama', 'Mia', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mega-bombs', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'especially', 'ghastly', 'Producers', 'truly', 'hideous', 'Rent', 'Eastwood', 'photographs', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'dim', 'washed-out', 'style', 'not', 'very', 'promising', 'ingredient', 'fun', 'fascinating', 'musical', 'bio', 'singing', 'team', 'color', 'be', 'seen', 'Everything', 'dark', 'brown', 'black', ""'re"", 'watching', 'grim', 'dramatic', 'story', 'stunted', 'personalities.None', 'cast', 'members', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'nothing', 'joyous', 'witty', 'When', 'group', 'finally', 'one', 'hit', 'tunes', 'one', 'singer', 'fourth', 'wall', 'narrative', 'speak', 'directly', 'camera', 'explain', 'plot', 'element', 'only', 'nothing', 'boredom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'musical', 'number', ""'re"", 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'actor', 'saying', 'us.The', 'story', 'begins', 'watch', 'evolution', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'stealing', 'safes', 'crashing', 'cars', 'going', 'prison', 'were', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'Then', 'watch', 'begin', 'meet', 'shady', 'characters', 'underworld', 'one', 'singers', 'dealing', 'drugs.We', 'watch', 'boys', 'finally', 'connect', 'even', 'here', 'are', 'short-changed', 'delightful', 'vocalizing', 'watch', 'rehearse', 'casual', 'manner', 'minutes', 'drag', 'realize', 'music', 'Eastwood', 'determined', 'pack', 'backstory', 'character', 'development.The', 'result', 'boring', 'retread', 'tough-boy-grows-up-on-the', 'mean', 'streets', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Public', 'Enemy', '1931', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Godfather', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'many', 'incarnations', 'movies', 'TV', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'blandness', 'supposedly', 'joyful', 'musical.We', 'then', 'spend', 'more', 'long', 'minutes', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'beautiful', 'feisty', 'Italian', 'girl', 'later', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'encounter', 'again', 'become', 'shrieking', 'drunken', 'shrew', 'reject', 'Real', 'Housewives', 'New', 'Jersey.Well', 'think', 'least', 'now', 'maybe', 'music', 'wait', 'now', 'have', 'Valli', 'daughter', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'being', 'tracked', 'down', 'NYC', 'discover', 'feels', 'rejected', 'famous', 'parent', 'musical', 'career', 'own', 'very', 'long', 'sequence', 'nowhere', 'daughter', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'nowhere', 'then', 'vanishes', 'story.Whew', 'thank', 'Lord', 'over', 'then', 'rather', 'hysterical', 'episode', 'where', 'aging', 'singers', 'are', 'now', 'inducted', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', ""'re"", 'now', 'aging', 'crooners', ""'re"", 'padded', 'bulky', 'walk', 'real', 'slow', 'wear', 'wigs', ""'d"", 'find', 'Halloween', 'Costume', 'shop.And', 'then', 'end', 'someone', 'nudged', 'Eastwood', 'musical', 'have', 'entire', 'cast', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'dance', 'maniacally', 'grinning', 'freeze', 'now', 'tune', 'Oh', 'What', 'Night', 'sudden', 'musical', 'number', 'shocks', 'what', 'audience', 'been', 'waiting', 'past', 'two', 'hours.Let', 'be', 'grateful', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'get', 'hands', 'remake', 'masterpiece', 'Sound', 'Music', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Andrew', 'swirling', 'around', 'hilltop', 'machine', 'gun', 'hand', 'singing', 'Du', 'Hills', 'Are', 'Alife', 'du', 'sound', 'mu-zak']",N/A

1697012,A2O451L6U4X8HM,B00K2CHUPY,"J. M. Fitzpatrick ""John Fitzpatrick""","[9, 10]","This is the movie based on the international hit musical show.It's an entertaining and engaging biopic, telling the story of the Four Seasons musical group, and its members.The focus of the movie is on telling the story of the band, rather than performance of the music. Nonetheless, several of the Four Seasons hits are presented as part of the story.Translating a musical from the stage to the screen can be a difficult process. The translation of Jersey Boys has involved a refocussing on the narrative story, rather than the music. I suspect the film is best viewed on its own merits as a biopic, rather than a stage show adapted to the screen. The structure of the story telling has been changed significantly from the stage show (which tells the group's story from the perspective of each member).I thought the direction by Clint Eastwood was masterful- telling the story in a matter of fact fashion, effectively blending drama, emotion and humor. The interactions between the members of the band - in particular their tensions - are portrayed realistically.It is an entertaining and well crafted film, which I suspect will satisfy most viewers.

1697015,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00K2CHUPY,Paul Allaer,"[26, 29]","""Jersey Boys"" (2014 release; 134 min.) is the big screen adaptation of the Broadway show ""Jersey Boys"", itself loosely based on the life and times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. As the movie opens, we are in 1951 in Belleville, NJ, where Frankie, then 16, is working in a barber shop. Over the course of the next 45 min., we get to know the other guys who would make up the group that would eventually name itself the Four Seasons (after a bowling alley, if we can believe the movie), and how slowly but surely the band is working towards success. The second half of the movie deals with less music-oriented themes, but focuses more on the tensions within the band and the personal sufferings and even tragedies they experience. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, I have not seen the Broadway show, so I cannot comment how closely it stays to that, although I am guessing that the dramatic elements have been played up and prolonged for Hollywood purposes (and that's fine by me). Second, the movie is directed (and also produced) by Clint Eastwood. If that surprises you, it really shouldn't as Eastwood is known to be a passionate music aficionado (he not only directed another music bio-pic ""Bird"" about jazz saxophonist Charlie ""Bird"" Parker in the late 80s, but he has also composed the movie score for a number of his movies, including the Oscar-winning ""Million Dollar Baby""). I happen to think Eastwood is one of the great director of this age, and at a mere 84 years of age, he's just getting warmed up! The movie is rich with visual details that you just feel are Eastwood's touch. Third, usually in this type of bio-pic, the earlier years tend to be the most interesting ones. Strangely enough, the exact opposite is true here: for me the movie didn't really take off until we see the four guys go at it against each other, with Tommy DeVito easily taking the price for biggest (take your pick) jerk/egomaniac, and later when Frankie deals with his estranged family (due to being on the road almost non-stop). Fourth, there are some great performances in the movie, none more so that John Lloyd Young as Frankie, the role which he also played for several years when the show opened on Broadway. You swear that it is Frankie himself. And that voice!Bottom line: although a bit long for its own good, ""Jersey Boys"" was very enjoyable, more so than I expected. To be honest, I don't know that I would've gone to see this, but for the fact that Eastwood directed this. The movie opened here in Cincinnati last weekend, and I saw it on a late matinee work day. I was quite surprised how well attended that screening was, indicating that this movie may have some legs amidst all of the seemingly endless stream of comic book and other such super-heroes action movies.

1697016,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00K2CHUPY,Stephanie De Pue,"[12, 13]","JERSEY BOYS, 2014, is a new biography/drama/musical, the history of four working class young men from New Jersey who somehow came together to form the iconic 1960s rock group The Four Seasons.  It is based on the long-running, massively popular Broadway musical of the same name.  As a film, it was directed by the iconic actor/macho movie star/director Clint Eastwood and written by Marshall Brickman.  According to Broadway.com, as quoted at IMDb, ""Jersey Boys is a musical biography of the Four Seasons-the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on front man Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.""Many reviewers have noted that director Eastwood was shrewd enough to cast as his principals mainly  young men who have worked in the theatrical production.  His stars include Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli, Johnny Cannizzaro as Nick DeVito and Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi.  I'd never seen any of them before, as unfortunately, I left New York and its Broadway some years ago.  And, in fact, I knew hardly any of the actors up on the screen, just Steve Schirripa, (THE SOPRANOS), as Vito; noted dancer Christopher Walken, (HAIRSPRAY), as Gyp DeCarlo, good-hearted mobster, and Lou Volpe, frequently cast as an Italian father, as Frankie's father.  But I rather liked the fact that I was seeing most of these actors for the first time; it added to the movie's credibility for me.  The qualifications of director Eastwood, who by now is possibly as well-known as a director,(INVICTUS, GRAN TORINO, MILLION DOLLAR BABY); as an actor, (BLOODWORK, UNFORGIVEN) have been questioned by some reviewers I have read elsewhere who doubt his ability to handle musical material.  Of course, other reviewers have replied that, in his career he has directed PLAY MISTY FOR ME, and BIRD, which was about jazzman Charlie Parker, both with musical themes.  Though never anything about rock and roll and it's possible he's not the best possible director for this material.  Many reviewers have also complained that the film is predictable, and utilizes every clich&eacute; in the book about its genre.  Guess this is more or less true; but whether it's to be a biopic about the Beatles or the Four Seasons it seems there are some constants, Stations of the Cross if you will.  Scuffling working class lads, who may have a few brushes with the law, or with the local mobsters.  Validation on the Ed Sullivan show.  The touring life, partying, girls, drugs, quarreling and dissolution of the group.  Stations of the Cross.  Hard to avoid.  Another reviewer complained that Christopher Walken, who began in show business as a dancer, wasn't in the big final dance scene.  But he was, saw him with my own eyes.  Perhaps not as front and center as he deserved to be, but hey...Well, as urbanites, in this house, we love a floating falsetto lead:  Frankie Lyman of the Teenagers, Smokey Robinson, Aaron Neville, Frankie Valli. I was lucky enough to see Frankie Valli once, at New York's Radio City Music Hall, and it was memorable.  My husband and I have been recommended many times to see ""Jerseys Boys"" on Broadway.  Haven't been able to manage it, doubt we ever will, though I believe it's still actually playing.  Too bad.  So we were eager to see the movie.  And we really liked it.  Well, it's our music; we know the melodies and words in our  red blood cells.  Similarly, you know whether it'll be your thing.Me, I've been humming and singing those songs all week, ever since seeing the picture.

1697018,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00K2CHUPY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 1]","Let&#8217;s face it. There are two groups of fans who will go and see &#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221;, the new film based on the hit play. Clint Eastwood has a long and storied career as both a star and a director and has built a large, devoted fan-base. The other group are fans of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, the subject of the extremely popular stage play upon which this movie is based. Neither group is the type known for running out to the theater on opening weekend (i.e. adults over 40) and snapping up a handful of tickets, leading to box office success. A teenage boy wouldn&#8217;t be caught anywhere near a theater showing this film. And teenaged boys, sadly, control the box office.&#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of Eastwood&#8217;s best. I have never seen the play, but I would guess this is a pretty faithful adaptation, down to the final dance number featuring the entire cast as the sort of final curtain call you would see on stage. It&#8217;s difficult to pin down, but I get the feeling Eastwood didn&#8217;t put his full energy into the project. Everything seems a little rote and routine, like he is following a well-read playbook and simply painting by numbers, following the source material too closely. I understand this is a very popular play and it is based on the real-life story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. But there are certain things that work better in a play and shouldn&#8217;t be carried over to the big-screen adaptation.One of the things that should have been changed? The characters each break the &#8220;Fourth Wall&#8221;, the wall between the stage, actors and scenery and the audience. This imaginary structure allows the audience to look in and observe the story. When a play or movie has done a good job, we feel as though we are eavesdropping and could reach out and touch Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts.Breaking the wall happens more frequently in stage plays, when a character will turn to and directly address the audience, giving them a bit of narrative to act as punctuation or keep the story moving. This same technique is rarely used in film; the whole point of going to a movie is to become a part of the characters&#8217; lives, to take a journey with them. When any character breaks the fourth wall, they are drawing us out of that cocoon, making us an observer of actors playing roles, rather than letting us become a part of the narrative. In &#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221;, each of the four main characters turns to the camera and addresses us, giving us little insights into their characters or their band mates. Ultimately, this almost becomes the same thing most people complain about musicals in the first place. Most people who don&#8217;t like musicals don&#8217;t like characters breaking into song and dance in the middle of a conversation or kiss or argument. It draws them out of the story. And this is exactly what the characters addressing us does. Breaking the Fourth Wall makes us aware that we are watching a film. Once that happens, it takes a while for viewers to lose themselves in the narrative again, if they are able to do that at all.The story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is told in an unremarkable linear fashion, giving us the highlights of the lives and careers of each of the musicians. What is missing are the details. And, frankly, if you have seen any other biopic about a musician, nothing in this story will seem particularly unique. The band members have financial problems, they have creative disagreements, they make deals with others, they have fights over the direction their band should take, they have problems with their wives, they have problems with their kids. Because everything is so familiar, you might hope that &#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221; would have a depth of detail that would help set it apart. At one point, just as they are about to become successful, Frankie eyes an older woman, Mary (Renee Marino) and decides to hit on her. She delivers the best line in the movie. &#8220;Call your mother, you&#8217;re going to be home late.&#8221; Next thing we know, they are married. Later, Frankie returns home and is fighting with Mary, apparently they have broken up. Their daughters sit on the stairwell, upset to hear their parents arguing. When did things go so wrong? When did they have kids? But we don&#8217;t get any of the details about why. This moment only serves as a plot point for a further development that is even more tenuous and doesn&#8217;t really get the attention it should.Here I am arguing that we don&#8217;t have enough details about a story that we can already recite from memory. This reminds me of the line from &#8220;Annie Hall&#8221;. &#8220;There&#8217;s an old joke &#8211;um&#8230; two elderly women are at a Catskill resort, and one of &#8216;em says, &#8220;Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.&#8221; The other one says &#8220;Yeah, I know; and such small portions.&#8221;Another reason I believe Eastwood didn&#8217;t have his heart in the film? Everything seems dull and poorly lit. This is clearly an artistic (or financial?) decision made by the filmmakers. I suspect it was a creative decision, to mimic the look of a musical from the 50s. But it doesn&#8217;t work. &#8220;An American in Paris&#8221;, &#8220;Singin&#8217; In the Rain&#8221; and other iconic musicals of this era are known for their bright, vibrant colors, showing everything in vivid detail. In &#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221;, everything seems like it is shot through a black and white filter, darkening and dulling the images. There are many movie theaters that don&#8217;t change their projection bulbs enough, resulting in the same sort of feel for most films they show. I&#8217;ve never experienced this at this theater, so I suspect it was a creative decision. So it seems odd that there was a conscious choice to give this story this look. It simply ends up looking amateurish.Eastwood is known as a director who knows what he wants and gets the job done, usually under budget. In fact, there was a story floating around the internet about how the four actors playing the leads in this film appreciated him for his economical filmmaking, i.e., fewer takes. I wonder if this desire to make the film quickly and under budget caused the dull, grainy look of the film. If so, it was bad decision because it just makes the film look cheap.The actors aren&#8217;t served by the Cliff Notes-like nature of the screenplay. John Lloyd Young, a relative newcomer, plays Frankie Valli. Initially, he shows us the confusion and the wonder Valli experiences navigating the treacherous waters of the music industry. But later, all of a sudden, Frankie is a hardened businessman, ready and willing to make difficult decisions for the sake of the band and for his band members. Tommy DeVito, played by Vincent Piazza, is the man who initially shepherds Frankie through the music business, but as their popularity grows, it becomes clear that he doesn&#8217;t have the vision to take them to the next level. Being pushed to the side seems to accelerate other problems Tommy has, leading to a big confrontation down the line. Michael Lomenda, also a relative newcomer, plays Nick Massi, the other original member of the band also coaching Frankie through the beginning, formative years, steering him from a life of crime to a life of music. His character is given the least amount of screen time and seems to be the least interesting. The last member of the group, Bob Gaudio, played by Erich Bergen (a number of television credits), joins them when they try out one of his songs. He and a co-writer go on to write most of the hits the band is known for. Gaudio is also the most familiar with the inner workings of the music industry and Frankie recognizes this, prompting Valli and Gaudio to form a side partnership of their own.After Valli experiences a traumatic event, the story suddenly shifts to the &#8216;90s, to the band&#8217;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, reuniting the aging members of the band for one last live performance. It is a nice moment, but you get the feeling that so much was cut out, to make the film an acceptable length.The music? It&#8217;s great and fun to hear again. But only one of the songs is given any real context. Another, we see the moment of inspiration, but beyond that all of the great songs seem to simply materialize out of thin air. Maybe this was the case, but most art is inspired by something, so it seems unlikely.&#8220;Jersey Boys&#8221; is okay, particularly when the music becomes a part of the narrative. But the &#8216;highlights-only&#8217; nature of the narrative and the grainy, dark look of the film serve to make the film seem amateurish and underwhelming.",3,Eastwood's Strictly By The Numbers

1697019,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00K2CHUPY,Turfseer,"[1, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***If you're forced to choose between Jersey Boys the Broadway Musical or Clint Eastwood's movie, I would recommend seeing the Broadway show. While the movie shows more in terms of historical material, the musical proves to be much more of an emotional experience.Eastwood starts the story of the Four Seasons with perhaps too much exposition. Christopher Walken shows up in the thankless role of 'Gyp', a local Mafioso who the founding member of the band, local hothead Tommy DeVito is beholden to. DeVito introduces Gyp to teenager Frankie Castelluccio (who later changes his name to Frankie Valli). We then learn how DeVito gets the young Frankie involved in criminal activity, DeVito ends up taking a 6 month rap for the burglary they were both involved in, Frankie meets Mary Delgado who convinces him to change his name to Valli (and they eventually get married), Nick Massi becomes part of the group and is sent to prison for trespassing at a local church (again Frankie is let off) and Frankie ends up a victim of a scam by two local hoodlums, one who pretends to murder the other.A good fifteen minutes could have been trimmed in order to get us to Act 2 sooner. Act 2 of course begins when Bob Gaudio joins the group and this is where the story gets interesting. Gaudio is the complete opposite of DeVito. He's an intellectual who quotes T.S. Elliot and his quite knowledgeable about the music business. DeVito is a gambler who demands to be the center of attention. Valli, on the other hand, though streetwise like Devito, is much more conservative and ends up making a business deal with Gaudio to split songwriting royalties and any outside business not involving the group.The group's rise to fame is quite entertaining as we learn how they hook up with their flamboyant, gay producer, Bob Crewe, who guides them in releasing their first hit, 'Sherry'. We get to hear a good number of the Four Seasons' big hits, which are staged by Eastwood as performance pieces (as opposed to big choreographed numbers).One of the best scenes is when Gaudio, Valli and Massi learn of DeVito's $100K debt to a loan shark as well as approximately $600K to the IRS. The honorable Valli agrees to play in Vegas until he pays off DeVito's debt. Before quitting the group, Massi sounds off about life on the road with DeVito and how difficult it was putting up with the tough guy narcissist. Gaudio and Valli had it easier, since they didn't have to room with the surly DeVito.Once the group breaks up, the focus is on Valli who must deal with the tragedy of the death of his daughter, due to a drug overdose. I seem to recall that the daughter's death was much more effective on stage than the way it's handled here by director Eastwood. Like all the female characters in the movie, Valli's daughter is underdeveloped and the way in which her demise is dealt with, seems a bit rushed.The ending of the film focuses on The Four Seasons induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. We learn what the band members were doing after years had passed and one notes that there is a reconciliation between DeVito and Valli. Clint Eastwood attempts to stage a big production number at film's end, but it falls completely flat (at one point the big cast freezes a number of times, and the entire production number ends up looking quite pathetically awkward).The acting is quite decent with John Lloyd Young (who starred in the original Broadway production) reproducing Frankie Valli's unusual falsetto voice. As in the Broadway show, each character speaks to the audience, inducing a Rashomon-like effect--telling the story from their different perspectives.Once Jersey Boys gets to the formation of The Four Seasons, the story takes on a life of its own. You can't argue with hearing all those great hits, souped up in modern day arrangements. I would recommend seeing this film but would also recommend seeing the Broadway show if you're ever in NYC. The film is not without its flaws (it could have been pared down), but in the end, it certainly entertains.",3,Eastwood's adaptation of Bway jukebox musical suffers from over long exposition but still entertains,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,4092,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***If', ""'re"", 'forced', 'choose', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Broadway', 'show', 'movie', 'more', 'terms', 'historical', 'material', 'musical', 'proves', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'experience.Eastwood', 'story', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'up', 'thankless', 'role', ""'Gyp"", 'local', 'Mafioso', 'who', 'founding', 'member', 'band', 'local', 'hothead', 'Tommy', 'DeVito', 'beholden', 'DeVito', 'Gyp', 'teenager', 'Frankie', 'Castelluccio', 'who', 'later', 'name', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'then', 'learn', 'how', 'DeVito', 'young', 'Frankie', 'involved', 'criminal', 'activity', 'DeVito', 'up', 'taking', '6', 'month', 'rap', 'burglary', 'were', 'involved', 'Frankie', 'Mary', 'Delgado', 'who', 'change', 'name', 'Valli', 'eventually', 'get', 'married', 'Nick', 'Massi', 'part', 'group', 'sent', 'prison', 'trespassing', 'local', 'church', 'again', 'Frankie', 'let', 'off', 'Frankie', 'up', 'victim', 'scam', 'two', 'local', 'hoodlums', 'one', 'who', 'murder', 'other.A', 'good', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'order', 'get', 'Act', '2', 'sooner', 'Act', '2', 'course', 'begins', 'when', 'Bob', 'Gaudio', 'group', 'where', 'story', 'interesting', 'Gaudio', 'complete', 'opposite', 'DeVito', 'intellectual', 'who', 'T.S', 'Elliot', 'quite', 'knowledgeable', 'music', 'business', 'DeVito', 'gambler', 'who', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'Valli', 'other', 'hand', 'streetwise', 'Devito', 'much', 'more', 'conservative', 'up', 'making', 'business', 'deal', 'Gaudio', 'split', 'songwriting', 'royalties', 'outside', 'business', 'not', 'involving', 'group.The', 'group', 'rise', 'fame', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'learn', 'how', 'hook', 'up', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Crewe', 'who', 'releasing', 'first', 'hit', ""'Sherry"", 'get', 'hear', 'good', 'number', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'big', 'hits', 'are', 'staged', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'pieces', 'opposed', 'big', 'choreographed', 'numbers', '.One', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'Gaudio', 'Valli', 'Massi', 'learn', 'DeVito', '100K', 'debt', 'loan', 'shark', 'as', 'well', 'approximately', '600K', 'IRS', 'honorable', 'Valli', 'play', 'Vegas', 'DeVito', 'debt', 'quitting', 'group', 'Massi', 'life', 'road', 'DeVito', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'putting', 'up', 'tough', 'guy', 'narcissist', 'Gaudio', 'Valli', 'had', 'easier', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'surly', 'DeVito.Once', 'group', 'up', 'focus', 'Valli', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'death', 'daughter', 'due', 'drug', 'overdose', 'seem', 'recall', 'daughter', 'death', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'stage', 'way', 'handled', 'here', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'female', 'characters', 'movie', 'Valli', 'daughter', 'underdeveloped', 'way', 'demise', 'dealt', 'bit', 'rushed.The', 'ending', 'film', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'induction', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', '1990', 'learn', 'what', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'doing', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'one', 'notes', 'reconciliation', 'DeVito', 'Valli', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'attempts', 'stage', 'big', 'production', 'number', 'film', 'end', 'completely', 'flat', 'one', 'point', 'big', 'cast', 'number', 'times', 'entire', 'production', 'number', 'up', 'looking', 'quite', 'pathetically', 'awkward', '.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'decent', 'John', 'Lloyd', 'Young', 'who', 'starred', 'original', 'Broadway', 'production', 'reproducing', 'Frankie', 'Valli', 'unusual', 'falsetto', 'voice', 'Broadway', 'show', 'character', 'audience', 'inducing', 'Rashomon-like', 'effect', 'telling', 'story', 'different', 'perspectives.Once', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'formation', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'story', 'life', 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'hearing', 'great', 'hits', 'souped', 'up', 'modern', 'day', 'arrangements', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Broadway', 'show', ""'re"", 'ever', 'NYC', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pared', 'down', 'end', 'certainly']",N/A
1697020,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00K2CHUPY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","My siblings and I were raised on oldies tunes such as Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Growing up it was the only type of music I knew. I've also been privileged to see the stage show JERSEY BOYS and it's one of my favorite shows to see performed on stage. I was excited to hear that they were making the show into a movie and that Clint Eastwood was directing, although I did wonder how well the musical would translate into the big screen. JERSEY BOYS the stage show is a jukebox musical that was created specifically for the stage (unlike a show such as HAIRSPRAY that was based off a movie with all intents and purposes of being translated back to the screen someday). It appeared that with the announcement of the cast (all the actors had acted in the stage show and Christopher Walken was going to have a part as Gyp DeCarlo), that the movie would turn out fine. However, then I saw the trailers for the film and noticed the lack of marketing and began to wonder.For the most part, JERSEY BOYS follows the script of the stage show word for word. Frankie Catelluccio (John Lloyd Young) lives in a fairly rough part of New Jersey. He's studying to be a barber, but he also has the voice of an angel. His friends are mostly low-level crooks and known associates of the mob. However, his friends know Frankie has a future as a musician if he can just get a break and his closest friend, Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) brings him into his band, the Four Lovers. Frankie changes his name to Frankie Valli and the group has some small successes, but things don't really take off until Joe Pesci (Joey Russo) introduces the group to the young songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen). From there, things skyrocket. The Four Lovers changes its name to The Four Seasons and soars into stardom. However, fame comes with a cost and the film follows different members of the group (mostly Frankie and Bob) until their reunion at The Four Seasons induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.The story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is a good one and one that should be told. It's a rags to riches tale, but also a tale about honor and friendship and respecting the debts owed to those who helped you when you couldn't help yourself.For those expecting a complete musical adaptation of the stage show, JERSEY BOYS will probably be somewhat disappointing. It does follow the script of the stage show rather closely, with several additional scenes. Also unchanged is how the main characters will break the fourth wall and speak directly to the audience. This was something I thought might have been dropped from the movie and I'm glad it wasn&#8217;t. With that said, this film is really a musical biopic and not a movie musical. Many if not most of the stage show numbers are in the film, but instead of being sung and performed as a big theatrical number, many of them have become a part of the soundtrack and underlie a scene that takes place on the screen. The movie is more akin in format to THE BILLY HOLLY STORY than it is to a movie like HAIRSPRAY.In terms of a movie, JERSEY BOYS is fairly good. The acting is good and really sparkles in certain moments. Both Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio and Mike Doyle as Bob Crewe do an excellent job and Christopher Walken steals every scene that he is in.However, JERSEY BOYS has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great move. That flaw is the film's length. With most of the script from the stage show intact, the movie is padded even more with a few extra scenes. This brings the total running time of the movie around 2 hours and fifteen minutes. In all reality, the movie should be closer to an hour and forty-five minutes. There's a good 15-20 minutes of the first act of the film that could have been completely cut and it would not have affected the plot of the movie at all. There are also a couple additional scenes that could have been cut without harming the plot (just about any time Frankie is riding in a car should have been cut). Once the first act ends and Bob Guido joins the group, the movie picks up the pace and doesn't really slow down until the end. However, the first act is so long and mostly unnecessary that it really dampens the flow and pace of the rest of the movie.Other than the length of the film, the only other negative about the movie is the makeup job on the actors when they perform together at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Make up has come a long way, but the makeup on each of the actors looks more like something out of a local theatre production than it does a major motion picture. A couple of the guys look alright, but a couple of them look horrible as the aged versions of their characters.Overall, JERSEY BOYS is an entertaining musical biopic. It will appeal to anyone who is interested in Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, but anyone who just likes a good story will probably enjoy it, too. The first act runs far longer than it should, but if you can make it past that, the rest of the film is a blast.",4,A Musical Biopic,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,5037,"['siblings', 'were', 'raised',

1697021,A6AT9WIGOXKRP,B00K2CHUPY,"Whipple McTeelson the Third ""Purveryor of Mad...","[0, 1]","Watching Clint taking a stab at whatever movie genre comes his way is like following behind some doddering old fool at the buffet on a cruise ship deciding he's filling up his plate with every last piece of everything laid out in front of him.  On one hand you have to admire the old man's taking a stand and living it up as long as he can.  But still and all, it comes a point where you just want him to shuffle off to his table and leave the rest of the food to those that can benefit from it.Sure, Clint didn't really take a job from anyone else that could have directed this.  There just comes a point where you wish the dignity the man used to live with and demonstrate as a virtue of sheer American exceptionalism would return.  It wasn't just his disheveled appearance at the Republican Convention that showed the world he's lost his way.  I'd point back to that reality show his family was on.  Those reality shows taint even the best of us.  He kicked Sandra Locke to the curb for far less than what he's putting up with.
