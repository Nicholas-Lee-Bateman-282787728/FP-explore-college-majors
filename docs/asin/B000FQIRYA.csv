Everyone should see a movie version of Pickwick.  The question is which version, the 1985 BBC version or the 1952 version.The 1985 version is a little over 5 hours long or 300+ minutes.  There is also a 30 minute reading attached (Simon Callow posing as Dickens, if you can stomach that).  The 1952 version is two hours long or 110 minutes.It never helps a comedy, still less a farce, to adopt a slow pace.  And to stop the show every 25 minutes to show titles and credits and to have some idiot tell you what you have just seen and what you are going to see next--this is detrimental to a comedy.  The pace of the 1985 is about three times slower than the 1952 version, which moves at a rapid pace.The result of this pacing is that there is very little in the longer version that is not also in the shorter version, the Christmas celebration at Wartles and a few other touches, like the (unseen) cricket match, the political campaign, and the hunting scenes.But the most serious problem with the 1985 version is the casting/acting.  None of the cast have particularly comic features, and all of them play their parts straight instead of playing them with that touch of the comic that makes such characters amusing.  The exception is Sam Weller, who is played better in the 1985 version than in the 1952 version.  The actor who played Pickwick was tolerable and sometimes bordered on the comic, but mostly his version of the character ranged from foolish to irritating.The 1985 version tries to show you a character who exhibits good will.  The 1952 version makes you feel good will.  (And incidentally, some of the best one-liners in the 1952 version are not even in the book!  For those who've read the book, I'll leave it to you to find them.  You'll be surprised.)The problem is that the 1952 version is only on VHS and LP speed at that.

The 1952 film, though excellent (see my review), is a good introduction to the book, but unfortunately lacks many of the delightful incidents that make the Pickwick Papers such a delight.  When I first read the Pickwick Papers as a teenager approaching 60 years ago, I recall I laughed out loud at some of the antics, and you know, I did the same when I viewed many of the scenes in this production.  Though James Hayter is, to me, the perfect Mr. Pickwick, Nigel Stock grows on one as the production proceeds.  All the subsidiary characters are perfectly cast.  This was the first major work by Charles Dickens - a delightful romp through the English countryside where the viewer will meet charlatans, bounders, strange rules and laws, debtor's prison, humorous romance with fainting ladies, mix-ups, and just plain fun.  This became a literary classic that still has value in today's seemingly more complicated age.  Was there ever a more simple age?

He was in business and made money. In his older age he decided to create a Club and to go around in the world with a few younger men to discover and enjoy that world of theirs.That leads him into strange places, some fine like rich gentlemen farmers, some shadier like an actor and his servant using their art to confuse and abuse people out of their money mostly, some even dark like an attempt by some women to make him pay for a promise he did not make though he did comfort them in some mishap of theirs and this episode will end up in court and in prison.What is superb is in fact the great benevolence of this rich businessman deprived of a family and relatives and his desire to do good to and with other people. It shows how the world reacts to this benevolence. Mostly they take advantage, or at least try to, of the situation. But Mr. Pickwick is a fighter and he can be very nasty at times, though he prefers liking people.He will help solve some problems and redress or reform some people and the whole series ends up with three weddings of absolutely nothing but love, two already performed and a third one to be performed. Mr. Pickwick will retire in some village not too far from London with his servant and the newly appointed housekeeper who is to become his servant's wife. The series is dynamic, in no way pretentious but entertaining and funny.The actor personating Pickwick is at times pathetic but always so romantic, his heart on his hand for everyone to take and yet a big cudgel behind his back for those who might intend to misuse it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Witty and romantic,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1692,"['Twelve', 'episodes', 'adventures', 'strange', 'Pickwick', 'who', 'obese', 'penguin', 'walks', 'one', 'was', 'business', 'made', 'money', 'older', 'age', 'decided', 'create', 'Club', 'go', 'around', 'world', 'few', 'younger', 'men', 'discover', 'enjoy', 'world', 'theirs.That', 'strange', 'places', 'fine', 'rich', 'gentlemen', 'farmers', 'shadier', 'actor', 'servant', 'using', 'art', 'confuse', 'abuse', 'people', 'money', 'mostly', 'even', 'dark', 'attempt', 'women', 'make', 'pay', 'promise', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'did', 'comfort', 'mishap', 'theirs', 'episode', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'court', 'prison.What', 'superb', 'fact', 'great', 'benevolence', 'rich', 'businessman', 'deprived', 'family', 'relatives', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'other', 'people', 'how', 'world', 'benevolence', 'Mostly', 'take', 'advantage', 'least', 'try', 'situation', 'Mr.', 'Pickwick', 'fighter', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'nasty', 'times', 'liking', 'people.He', 'will', 'help', 'solve', 'problems', 'redress', 'reform', 'people', 'whole', 'series', 'up', 'three', 'weddings', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'love', 'two', 'already', 'performed', 'third', 'one', 'be', 'performed', 'Mr.', 'Pickwick', 'will', 'retire', 'village', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'London', 'servant', 'newly', 'appointed', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'become', 'servant', 'wife', 'series', 'dynamic', 'way', 'pretentious', 'entertaining', 'funny.The', 'actor', 'personating', 'Pickwick', 'times', 'pathetic', 'always', 'so', 'romantic', 'heart', 'hand', 'everyone', 'take', 'yet', 'big', 'cudgel', 'back', 'who', 'might', 'intend', 'misuse', 'it.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I love the English actors' distinctive looks and even more distinctive performances--America simply can't match English actors for sheer interesting-ness of countenance and expression :^). Mr. Pickwick is a wonderfully rotund and good-natured, although occasionally touchy, retired gentleman who sallies forth with his friends and takes part in a series of comic adventures and misadventures. Having recently read the book, I would say the writer and the actors did a wonderful job of bringing Dicken's characters to life and sticking with the main storyline. Some of my favorite moments: fat Tupman and skinny Miss Rachel declaring passionate love for each other...Mr. Pickwick calling Tupman a ""fellow,"" and telling him he's too old and fat to dress up like a bandit...""Ode to an Expiring Frog""...pretty much any scene with Jingle in it...Sam Weller in the courtroom scene...the whole series is full of richly hilarious, as well as thought-provoking moments. It is filmed in video-camera style so it feels like you're in the room with the characters.
