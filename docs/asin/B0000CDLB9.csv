The series was filmed in Australia and it aired on here in the states on the Family Channel, known now as ABC Family. I recall watching it as a kid on the weekends. Sadly, The USA DVD releases have been lazy, releasing only a handful of episodes. Here is the pilot movie called ""The Race"" which had an American showing up on the McGregor farm claiming to be a long loss nephew, who happens to have an agenda against the family.  It's great first episode (well actually it is episode one and two wrapped into one).",5,The First Episode of the Series,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,604,"['Snow', 'River', 'McGregor', 'Saga', 'two', 'Disney', 'movies', 'more', 'based', 'poem', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'aired', 'here', 'states', 'Family', 'Channel', 'known', 'now', 'ABC', 'Family', 'recall', 'watching', 'kid', 'weekends', 'Sadly', 'USA', 'DVD', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'lazy', 'releasing', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'Here', 'pilot', 'movie', 'called', 'Race', 'had', 'American', 'showing', 'up', 'McGregor', 'farm', 'claiming', 'be', 'long', 'loss', 'nephew', 'who', 'have', 'agenda', 'family', 'great', 'first', 'episode', 'well', 'actually', 'episode', 'one', 'two', 'wrapped', 'one']",N/A

I was disappointed that it was not based on the movie The Man from Snowy River with Kirk Douglas, which I loved.  This is a good series, however, and I hope that it will be released on box set DVD here in the USA.

775595,A3T2GFSCZVUAP7,B0000CDLB9,"S. Wetzel ""music /movie fan""","[0, 0]","A throwback to simpler shows on television.  Shows you could watch with younger children and not have to explain the double-entendres and deal with the potty humor. The plots are simple and definitely not full of post-modern self-awareness.  I vaguely remember this show broadcast in syndication.  Funny how the two young leads have become successful film stars (yes that is a young Guy Pearce of Memento and LA Confidential fame and a young Josh Lucas of Sweet Home Alabama and Stealth fame) playing Aussie Rob McGregor and his hotheaded American cousin Luke.  I guess some of the other Australian actors have gone on to bigger things in their country.  Andrew Clarke has done a lot of American TV guest roles.  Wendy Hughes guest-starred on Star Trek Next Generation as a love interest for Capt Picard.  However, what Artisan has done (and the reason I docked it a star) was take two episodes and combine them into a 90-minute movie, so you've got two unrelated stories.  Now I believe Artisan has been incorporated into Lions Gate Entertainment.  What Lions Gate should do is release this series in season sets.  (SPOILER: Josh Lucas only appears in Season 1; apparently his character dies in the last episode of the season -- sorry ladies. In reality he apparently got disillusioned with making a TV show in another country, Hollywood hypocrisy and teen idoldom, and quit show biz for a year, moved to NYC  to go back to college or taking acting/voice classes - claiming he worked with a dialect coach to lose his southern accent -- the accent he speaks with here is the one I've always heard him speak with when not in ""character"" so I think he's having some fun with the public...Don't get me wrong: I like him as an actor; here he's a little green around the gills, but some raw talent shows through)",4,where's the whole season 1 set?,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1807,"['throwback', 'simpler', 'shows', 'television', 'could', 'watch', 'younger', 'children', 'not', 'have', 'explain', 'double-entendres', 'deal', 'potty', 'humor', 'plots', 'are', 'simple', 'definitely', 'not', 'full', 'post-modern', 'self-awareness', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'show', 'broadcast', 'syndication', 'Funny', 'how', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'have', 'become', 'successful', 'film', 'stars', 'yes', 'young', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Memento', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'fame', 'young', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'Stealth', 'fame', 'playing', 'Aussie', 'Rob', 'McGregor', 'hotheaded', 'American', 'cousin', 'Luke', 'guess', 'other', 'Australian', 'actors', 'have', 'gone', 'bigger', 'things', 'country', 'Andrew', 'Clarke', 'done', 'lot', 'American', 'TV', 'guest', 'roles', 'Wendy', 'Hughes', 'guest-starred', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'love', 'interest', 'Capt', 'Picard', 'However', 'what', 'Artisan', 'done', 'reason', 'docked', 'star', 'was', 'take', 'two', 'episodes', 'combine', '90-minute', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'unrelated', 'stories', 'Now', 'believe', 'Artisan', 'been', 'incorporated', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Entertainment', 'What', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'should', 'do', 'release', 'series', 'season', 'sets', 'SPOILER', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'only', 'Season', '1', 'apparently', 'character', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'sorry', 'ladies', 'reality', 'apparently', 'got', 'disillusioned', 'making', 'TV', 'show', 'country', 'Hollywood', 'hypocrisy', 'teen', 'idoldom', 'quit', 'show', 'biz', 'year', 'moved', 'NYC', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'taking', 'acting/voice', 'classes', 'claiming', 'worked', 'dialect', 'coach', 'lose', 'southern', 'accent', 'accent', 'here', 'one', ""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'speak', 'when', 'not', 'character', 'so', 'think', 'having', 'fun', 'public', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'actor', 'here', 'little', 'green', 'gills', 'raw', 'talent', 'shows']",N/A
775596,A2ZLQ0L1KU9VLO,B0000CDLB9,"Terry R. Reynolds ""terr@mpinet.net""","[33, 34]","I watched the series on Family Channel, and it has always been one of my favorites. I only wish more of the series was out on DVD. This DVD is formatted as a single movie by tying the first two episodes together. Though it leaves the primary conflict somewhat hanging, and there is a clear division between the episodes, enough is resolved to make the story stand alone. The quality of the writing and acting is among the best done for television, and is superior to that of the movie ""The Man from Snowy River"" and its sequel. There is a good mixture of drama, comedy, and a little adventure. It is something of a western (set in Australia), though it is no shoot-em-up. The story was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching, until I moved somewhere that didn't have the Family Channel. (a grave disappointment) I am amazed that the show hasn't gone much into syndication.For the general viewer:If you are looking for a captivating story with some action, romance, and drama, this is good. If you're looking for an action-thriller or heavy sex, pass it up.For Parents:* no gratuitous sex or violence* no objectionalbe(to me)morals* story probably not too interesting to small childrenNote: There is some minimal physical violence. There was fisticuffs between two young rivals for a girl's affections, and an angered parent roughly handled a teacher that had physically abused his daughter. (Nothing excessive - He was clearly reigning in his justifiable anger. The abuse itself was not shown.)",5,I cannot over-recommend this title.,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1500,"['watched', 'series', 'Family', 'Channel', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'only', 'wish', 'more', 'series', 'was', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'formatted', 'single', 'movie', 'tying', 'first', 'two', 'together', 'primary', 'conflict', 'somewhat', 'hanging', 'clear', 'division', 'episodes', 'enough', 'resolved', 'make', 'story', 'stand', 'alone', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'best', 'done', 'television', 'superior', 'movie', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'sequel', 'good', 'mixture', 'drama', 'comedy', 'little', 'adventure', 'something', 'western', 'set', 'Australia', 'shoot-em-up', 'story', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'interesting', 'keep', 'watching', 'moved', 'somewhere', 'that', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Family', 'Channel', 'grave', 'disappointment', 'am', 'amazed', 'show', ""n't"", 'gone', 'much', 'general', 'viewer', 'are', 'looking', 'captivating', 'story', 'action', 'romance', 'drama', 'good', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action-thriller', 'heavy', 'sex', 'pass', 'up.For', 'Parents', '*', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence*', 'objectionalbe', 'morals*', 'story', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'interesting', 'small', 'childrenNote', 'minimal', 'physical', 'violence', 'was', 'fisticuffs', 'two', 'young', 'rivals', 'girl', 'affections', 'angered', 'parent', 'roughly', 'handled', 'teacher', 'had', 'physically', 'abused', 'daughter', 'Nothing', 'excessive', 'was', 'clearly', 'reigning', 'justifiable', 'anger', 'abuse', 'was', 'not', 'shown']",N/A
