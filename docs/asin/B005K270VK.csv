1463515,A1X2JFESEW5B70,B005K270VK,AgedWireHead,"[0, 0]","A cat has two humans--which is pretty common if the cat gets the run of his neighborhood, as this one does.  One human is the young daughter of the widowed chief of police and the other is a cat burglar.  The cat and the cat burglar are very adept at negotiating the roofs and walls of Paris.  The cat is, of course, the hero in this movie because he encourages the good guys to be better guys and stand up to the bad guys.  And thankfully, the cat does this  as a cat, not as a human in cat form.  In fact, I enjoyed that the writers, directors, and animators actually appreciate the character of an ""independent"" cat.  (OK, I like cats a lot, but a dog is the quintessential ...)The characters develop somewhat, but mostly they play their appropriate part.  A theme I enjoy is a parent growing in appreciation of her child, and that is probably the most real part of this story.  Another wonderful theme is that of redemption for several of the characters.The animation is quite artistic and amazingly involving as it sweeps across the roofs of the city.  A strange part of this art is that the colors seem to pulsate, as each cell looks hand colored with an unusual method.  In this day of ever-more-real-looking animation, I found myself enjoying this art, although I found it difficult to watch at first--so much so that I almost stopped watching the movie.  I am glad I didn't.  I not only got used to it quickly, but realized it is a fundamental part of the expression of the movie.  It provides a very strong extra dimension to what would otherwise be much more two-dimensional.In retrospect, I found this movie is art that is truly enjoyable as a complete work, more even than other French animated movies I have enjoyed.  And that really surprises me.",4,Very Pleasant Animated Feature,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,1761,"['cat', 'two', 'humans', 'pretty', 'common', 'cat', 'run', 'neighborhood', 'one', 'One', 'human', 'young', 'daughter', 'widowed', 'chief', 'police', 'other', 'cat', 'burglar', 'cat', 'cat', 'burglar', 'are', 'very', 'adept', 'negotiating', 'roofs', 'walls', 'Paris', 'cat', 'course', 'hero', 'movie', 'good', 'guys', 'be', 'better', 'guys', 'stand', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'thankfully', 'cat', 'cat', 'not', 'human', 'cat', 'form', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'writers', 'directors', 'animators', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'character', 'independent', 'cat', 'OK', 'like', 'cats', 'lot', 'dog', 'quintessential', 'characters', 'develop', 'somewhat', 'mostly', 'play', 'appropriate', 'part', 'theme', 'enjoy', 'parent', 'growing', 'appreciation', 'child', 'probably', 'most', 'real', 'part', 'story', 'wonderful', 'theme', 'redemption', 'several', 'characters.The', 'animation', 'quite', 'artistic', 'amazingly', 'involving', 'roofs', 'city', 'strange', 'part', 'art', 'colors', 'seem', 'pulsate', 'cell', 'hand', 'colored', 'unusual', 'method', 'day', 'ever-more-real-looking', 'animation', 'found', 'enjoying', 'art', 'found', 'difficult', 'watch', 'first', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'only', 'got', 'used', 'quickly', 'realized', 'fundamental', 'part', 'expression', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'extra', 'dimension', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'two-dimensional.In', 'retrospect', 'found', 'movie', 'art', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'complete', 'work', 'more', 'even', 'other', 'French', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'really']",A Cat in Paris [Region 4]

1463520,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B005K270VK,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 3]","I still remember the first time I saw the box for A Cat in Paris a few months ago. I was looking for a movie for my daughter, and then I saw it- something I never saw or even heard of before. Whenever I see a new, mysterious animated movie pop up on the shelf like that, it always gets me interested. It's no secret that Disney and Dreamworks dominate animation these days, and to see something with a cool look to it like A Cat in Paris does, is a breath of fresh air. Sadly, I was stuck watching the English dub version when I was able to watch it, causing me to put up with a very pitiful performance or two. It may not seem fair to factor that into my review, so if I can watch the movie with the French voices, I'll up the rating...provided that they ARE better.Zoe is a young girl living with her mom, Jeanne, in Paris. Her father was killed by a nasty gangster, Victor Costa, and it's left Jeanne (who works on the police force) a little obsessed with catching the murderer. She has nightmares about Costa, in the form of a red octopus for some reason, coming after her, and all her efforts to stop him being ineffective. Zoe also has her babysitter, Claudine, for support, but her main friend seems to be her cat that leaves every night and brings her back a lizard. Zoe doesn't talk at all, seemingly traumatized by what happened with her dad, and it doesn't help that her own mom barely pays attention to her. Meanwhile, Costa is still at large with his henchmen and they're looking to steal a huge African statue that's about to be displayed at the local museum. We also see that the cat just so happens to work with Nico, a burglar in the area. Nico just steals jewelry, never hurting anyone to get what he wants. Can you guess what's going to happen with these groups once Zoe follows the cat and Nico one night?First, I want to mention how nice the animation is in A Cat in Paris. It's nothing brilliant or beautiful, yet the look works, fitting the mood and tone of the story. Watching Nico's body flow like a snake as he creeps around in the opening sequence got me a little more interested in the movie, wondering how serious everything here was going to be. For the most part, characters move and behave realistically, except for Nico when he's sneaking and being stealthy. My absolute favorite part of the animation was a simple white line on black segment where Nico is moving through a dark room with night vision goggles on. Simple, but great! It adds a very unique quality to the character that I liked. The settings also caught my eye with how colorful locations were, even with the majority of the movie taking place at night. I'd love to see some production sketches and paintings if any are available. It's too bad an 'Art of' book for this movie hasn't been made! The film's soundtrack is also very fitting, blending with the visuals perfectly. This movie has a ton of style and I'd love to see more like this. Finally there's the cat, who admittedly doesn't get enough screen time. I loved how he would step in when needed to help with an escape, doing his part in a fight, and especially when he'd just casually walk by the neighbor's dog, causing it to bark and get silenced by the owner. The cat rules....ok as you can see the good things I said had to do with the art, music and the cat himself. Why? Because everything else threw me off. The plot isn't terrible, just done to death. Luckily the movie's very short and doesn't drag on, even with the sub-par story. I would've liked more to be done with Jeanne's nightmares instead of just seeing octo-Costa laughing and not doing a whole lot to her. Don't take that the wrong way, as I didn't want to see horrible things done to her, but all he does is laugh for the most part! Jeanne was a very boring character to me as well, only showing emotion when she found out where Costa is, and again later when something big happens. She's just a bland character that could almost be taken out of the movie entirely. In fact, she could! Nico serves as the main hero, more or less, with Jeanne being there because it's standard for a parent to be involved with films like this. And as much as I love the art of this movie, I didn't care much for the lack of facial expressions when it came to Jeanne and Nico. Costa and his boys had some nice expressions here and there, so what happened with these two? The little twist during the film's climax also seemed out of place, even with it being semi-explained before it takes place.Then there's the voice acting. Dear lord...I know Marcia Gay Harden is a fairly accomplished actress, but the woman should NOT have been cast for the role of Jeanne. Her acting here is the most stale, sleep-inducing work I've heard in an animated film in years. This brings up my point about big names being cast for animated movies when voice actors, trained to do this kind of thing, are plentiful and could use the work. Nope! She got the job instead, and did horribly with it. Ben Stein has more emotion when he talks for god's sake. They even got Anjelica Huston to play the role of Claudine, a fairly large role in the first half of the movie, then goes to waste in no time. The other actors do fine, fortunately.A Cat in Paris didn't leave much of a lasting impression on me, save for the poor voice acting fiasco, and I doubt I'll watch it again in the future. It's hard to recommend this to any specific groups- the movie doesn't have any blood, no sense of danger due to Costa's men not being much of a threat, and only really has one fight scene. Yet I can't really recommend it to kids under 10, and it lacks a lot of substance for it to be for anyone aside from animation junkies. Due to the short runtime though, there are worse ways to kill an hour of your time. If you have the option to watch it in French, I'm pretty sure you'll be better off, even having not heard it this way.Even Shaq would have been a better choice over Harden.",3,Pep&eacute; Le Pew

1463527,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B005K270VK,David A. Wend,"[3, 3]","My initial interest in A Cat in Paris came from an excellent review but I was also interested in seeing the film from my own interest in cats and that the film is hand-drawn animation.  The story revolves around Dino, a cat that lives a double life. By day, he is the pet of Zo and by night, he is the companion of a bugler, who appears to be as flexible as a cat.  Zo's mother, a somewhat neglectful parent, is a police inspector, seeking to capture a notorious criminal. The characters of the two stories soon join together when the criminals her mother is after endanger Zo.I enjoyed the animation. The colors are magnificent and the style of drawing was a refreshing change from the CG animation that is more often used for animated films. I must add that I got so caught up in the story that I didn't try to guess the cast members that were doing the voices, as I usually like to do.

1463529,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B005K270VK,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[20, 22]","------------------------------------------------------------""A Cat In Paris""(Folimage/New Arts, 2010/2012)------------------------------------------------------------A real gem from French animators Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol... This brilliant, stylish, wildly creative thriller has a look and feel unlike anything being produced in the United States these days. Visually the film is gorgeous: the graphic design is odd and angular, with purposeful nods to film noir's camera angles and use of darkness and shadows, along with a color palette that's filled with rich, unusual choices. The delicious graphics are complimented by a slinky spy-jazz score that feels alternately moody and retro.Thematically, ""A Cat In Paris"" is practically an anti-Disney kids' movie: it's stylish and unpredictable; there is a dead parent, but it's the kid's dad, not her mother (who, rather than being dead is a strong, no-nonsense police detective... A great female role model, along with the movie's young heroine...) The story is intelligent and brisk, a refreshingly original plot about a clever cat who slips out at night to join a lithe, roguish burglar who likes stealing stuff just for the challenge but has a strong sense of right and wrong when it comes to taking care of little kids. Best of all it presents cats in a favorable light and makes fun of dogs instead. Like I said: the opposite of Disney.Lots to love here: alt-oriented families who enjoy material that's fun but off the beaten track will definitely want to check this on out!

From Folimage, the studio behind Mia And The Migoo, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. So that alone makes it worth looking up.The film is set in modern day Paris, and deals with a cat burglar named Nico that befriends an actual cat(whose name we never cat)that also doubles as a housecat for Zoe, a lonely young girl that lives worth her mother Jeanne, a police detective whose husband was killed by an infamous criminal mastermind, Victor Costa. Victor plans on stealing a large statue from a Paris museum, and has his over-perfumed girlfriend posing as Zoe housekeeper to get info from the police. Despite a lot of bungling from his henchmen, Victor does nearly succeed in his plan, although Zoe's teaming up with Nico through their shared cat manages to bring them together, and reluctantly Jeanne too, despite her knowledge of Nico's &#34;career&#34;. The bad guys are foiled, and somehow Nico is cleared of his charges, and is now living with Jeanne and Zoe as a family.The titular cat plays the intermediary throughout the story, and surprisingly doesn't have a speaking role in it or any inner monologue like Garfield, but still lives up to his role as the focal point of the movie.

This little film, filled with simple pleasures, was nominated for a 2012 Academy Award and just seems pleasingly different from the increasingly boisterous tone of most U.S. animation.  It's a small movie, to be sure, without particularly lofty goals--but that's what I enjoyed about it.  It's a flight of fancy, a bit of sophisticated escapism that you don't have to be anesthetized to enjoy with your older children.  This is a real family film (not just a kiddie flick).  As they enjoy the mischievous feline, you can relish in the Paris backdrop and fondly recall rooftop chases from ""To Catch A Thief.""  This two-pack release has both the DVD and the Blu-ray feature and you may opt to see the film with its original subtitles or with the new soundtrack.  For American distribution, Marcia Gay Harden, Anjelica Huston (with a fairly peculiar accent) and Matthew Modine headline the vocal talent.In addition to the 62 minute feature (in both English and French), this release has a cute short film entitled ""Extinction of the Saber-Toothed Housecat"" (also rated PG) and ""The Many Lives of A Cat"" Video Flipbook.Despite these extras, though, the real star is the main show!  The furry critter in the leading role is living a double life.  During the day, it's a domestic pet for a troubled young girl reeling from the violent murder of her father.  During the night, it prowls the cityscape with a human cat burglar scoring exotic treasures.  Harden voices the girl's mother and Huston is a new housekeeper.  As Harden, a police inspector, closes in on the criminal ring that was responsible for her husband's death--the two worlds get pulled closer together.  And as danger approaches, might our nighttime criminals actually take on the roles of unexpected heroes?  I think it's a safe bet, but it's a pleasure to see how.  One particularly memorable scene (in the dark) is done simply with crude line drawings and was my favorite moment in the whole movie.""A Cat in Paris"" may not be for the very young, but it is certainly for the young at heart.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 3]","European animated films are lot different from the Disney classics and the CGI images in the Pixar produced films. Two examples of this are recent DVD releases of two 2011 Academy Award Nominees, interestingly both from the same distributor - GKIDS - and both being released on DVD and Bluray by New Video. One is ""Chico & Rita"" - which is in Spanish and which I'll be reviewing separately and this - ""A Cat in Paris"" - is from France. But for it's US release the film was ""dubbed""  (if that's the proper term for an animated film - in English with a cast that includes Marcia Gay Harden, Anjelica Huston and Matthew Modine.The film is short - just 62 minutes - and the end credits seem to take nearly five of those minutes. The production crew - mostly French - is huge. The art style is modern, with sharp edges, somewhat like a Picasso painting. But with European animated films, it's more about the story - and the music - than that the graphics look real.This is a story of a cat burglar and a cat that ""burgles"". (You'll understand when you see it.). There are bad guys (but mostly comical ones) and some exciting chase sequences (over the roofs of Paris) made even more exciting by a superbly written suspenseful musical score that would fit well in any Hitchcock film.There is nothing offensive here and even children (8 and up, I'm guessing) would enjoy watching it. I do have some reservations, however, as the moral issues that come up in the script. I find it hard to explain how a person who robs houses for a living becomes a ""hero"" in the end. You can decide after you see it - and I do recommend that you do!The Bluray/DVD combo package comes with some interesting bonuses, though I'm greedy in wishing there was a commentary track (Like ""Chico & Rita""). What we get is the 3  minute animated short ""Extinction of the Saber-Toothed Housecat"" that accompanied ACIP in theaters, and a 9-minute ""Flipbook"" showing the story boards of three versions of the film. Because the film is animated, the producers were able to allow the viewer to watch the film in French with English subtitles, which gives it more of a French flavor. (In the English language version, the characters sound like they are from New York).It's great that this is being made available for home video as the film didn't have a large distribution in theaters.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Oscar Nominated Animated film about a cat burglar and a cat - Family friendly but with one moral issue.,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,2433,"['European', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'different', 'Disney', 'classics', 'CGI', 'images', 'Pixar', 'produced', 'films', 'Two', 'examples', 'are', 'recent', 'DVD', 'releases', 'two', '2011', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominees', 'interestingly', 'same', 'distributor', 'GKIDS', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'New', 'Video', 'One', 'Chico', 'Rita', 'Spanish', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'separately', 'Cat', 'Paris', 'France', 'US', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'dubbed', 'proper', 'term', 'animated', 'film', 'English', 'cast', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Matthew', 'Modine.The', 'film', 'short', 'just', '62', 'minutes', 'end', 'seem', 'take', 'nearly', 'five', 'minutes', 'production', 'crew', 'mostly', 'French', 'huge', 'art', 'style', 'modern', 'sharp', 'edges', 'somewhat', 'Picasso', 'painting', 'European', 'animated', 'films', 'more', 'story', 'music', 'graphics', 'look', 'real.This', 'story', 'cat', 'burglar', 'cat', 'burgles', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'it.', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'mostly', 'comical', 'ones', 'exciting', 'chase', 'sequences', 'roofs', 'Paris', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'superbly', 'written', 'suspenseful', 'musical', 'score', 'would', 'fit', 'well', 'Hitchcock', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'here', 'even', 'children', '8', 'up', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', 'however', 'moral', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'script', 'find', 'hard', 'explain', 'how', 'person', 'who', 'robs', 'houses', 'living', 'hero', 'end', 'can', 'decide', 'see', 'do', 'recommend', 'do', 'Bluray/DVD', 'combo', 'package', 'interesting', 'bonuses', ""'m"", 'greedy', 'wishing', 'was', 'commentary', 'track', 'Chico', 'Rita', 'What', 'get', '3', 'minute', 'animated', 'short', 'Extinction', 'Saber-Toothed', 'Housecat', 'accompanied', 'ACIP', 'theaters', '9-minute', 'Flipbook', 'showing', 'story', 'boards', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'film', 'animated', 'producers', 'were', 'able', 'allow', 'viewer', 'watch', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'more', 'French', 'flavor', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'characters', 'sound', 'are', 'New', 'York', '.It', 'great', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'distribution', 'theaters.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",A Cat in Paris [Region 4]
1463575,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005K270VK,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","""A Cat in Paris"" (""Une vie de chat"") is an enjoyable animation film about a six-year-old girl Zo&eacute; and her pet, a cat named Dino. Dino has been leading a double life, unknown to Zo&eacute;, who stopped speaking after a tragic event happened to her family.When night comes, Dino sneaks out of the little girl's Paris room and becomes a trusted partner of a master thief stealing jewelry. One night, however, Zo&eacute; too goes out alone at night following Dino, and she gets involved in trouble when overhearing the gangsters planning to steal a precious African sculpture.Directed by Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol from France's acclaimed animation studio Folimage, the film was nominated for Oscar in 2012 (but lost to ""Rango""). The film's highly stylized artworks, based on designs of old-fashioned, hand-drawn type of animation films, may not appeal to you at first, but keep watching. You will soon forget it as the film's adventure story unfolds, involving the cat, the cops, the criminals and the girl.The simple story of the 65-minute film starts out slowly, but picks up the pace, told effectively with occasional low-key humor, nice jazzy soundtrack and creative ideas (animated ""hide-and-seek"" in a pitch-black room, for instance). The film benefits from the stylishly drawn night sceneries of Paris - most of the main events take place at night - including the top of the Notre Dame cathedral.The film deals with potentially dark themes, but discreetly treats them. Story-wise, ""A Cat in Paris"" may not be as unique as that of another French Oscar nominated animation, Sylvain Chomet's ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" but ""A Cat in Paris"" is an entertaining family picture.",5,"(4.5 STARS) A Cat, a Girl, a Theif, Cops and Some Bumbling Gangsters: Entertaining French Animation Film",1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1695,"['Cat', 'Paris', 'Une', 'vie', 'de', 'chat', 'enjoyable', 'animation', 'film', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'pet', 'cat', 'named', 'Dino', 'Dino', 'been', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'unknown', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'who', 'stopped', 'speaking', 'tragic', 'event', 'happened', 'family.When', 'night', 'Dino', 'little', 'girl', 'Paris', 'room', 'trusted', 'partner', 'master', 'thief', 'stealing', 'jewelry', 'One', 'night', 'however', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'too', 'out', 'alone', 'night', 'following', 'Dino', 'involved', 'trouble', 'when', 'overhearing', 'gangsters', 'planning', 'steal', 'precious', 'African', 'sculpture.Directed', 'Jean-Loup', 'Felicioli', 'Alain', 'Gagnol', 'France', 'acclaimed', 'animation', 'studio', 'Folimage', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '2012', 'lost', 'Rango', 'film', 'highly', 'stylized', 'artworks', 'based', 'designs', 'old-fashioned', 'hand-drawn', 'type', 'animation', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'first', 'keep', 'watching', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', 'film', 'adventure', 'story', 'unfolds', 'involving', 'cat', 'cops', 'criminals', 'girl.The', 'simple', 'story', '65-minute', 'film', 'out', 'slowly', 'up', 'pace', 'told', 'effectively', 'occasional', 'low-key', 'humor', 'nice', 'jazzy', 'soundtrack', 'creative', 'ideas', 'animated', 'hide-and-seek', 'pitch-black', 'room', 'instance', 'film', 'benefits', 'stylishly', 'drawn', 'night', 'sceneries', 'Paris', 'most', 'main', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'including', 'top', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'cathedral.The', 'film', 'deals', 'potentially', 'dark', 'themes', 'discreetly', 'Story-wise', 'Cat', 'Paris', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'unique', 'French', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'animation', 'Sylvain', 'Chomet', 'Triplets', 'Belleville', 'Cat', 'Paris', 'entertaining', 'family', 'picture']",A Cat in Paris [Region 4]

There's the cat, of course, living his double life - kind of makes me wonder what my own cats are up to. Strong female leads also stand out, in the form of the girl and her mother. And there's the lovable rogue, the burglar who comes through in the end. That much is enjoyable entertainment, ahead of the pack but nothing truly memorable.That's where the animation style steps in. We've been through the computer-y stuff and the attempts at realism. Fine - but it's warm personality, strong style, and interesting use of imagery that really makes a movie, no matter what kind, and this has wonderful visual style and personality. I can't draw close similarities to anything else I've seen, but there might be traces of Cubist influence here.

Dubbed in English, this 2010 French animated feature is pure delight from beginning till end. The story is a cops and robbers burglar story and the deft narrative devices and beautiful hand-drawn animation elevate it above a regular cartoon feature.Set in Paris, the story centers around a young girl named Zo&eacute; (English dub by Lauren Weintraub) who lives with her widowed police commissair mother Jeanne (English dub by Marcia Gay Harden). Zo&eacute;'s cat likes shadowing a burglar named Nico (English dub by Steven Blum) and when the cat gives Zo&eacute; a 'present' in the form of a bracelet, Jeanne realizes that the bracelet might be tied in to the spate of burglaries in the area. Jeanne and her team are on the trail of a notorious criminal named Victor Costa (English dub by JD Blanc) who was also responsible for Jeanne's husband's death.The story moves on at a fast pace and kept our interest. The plot is engaging, peopled with interesting characters, both benign and sinister, and my daughter could not take her eyes off the screen. She loved Zo&eacute;'s character as well as Nico, and though she was a little afraid during certain nail-biting parts, she enjoyed the movie immensely.The feature runs at 62 minutes, in full color, and there are several bonus features:""The Many Lives of a Cat"" Video Flipbook""Extinction of the Saber-Toothed Housecat"" Bonus Short FilmAlternate Original French Audio Track with English SubtitlesU.S. Trailer",5,Engrossing animated feature,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1619,"['eight-year-old', 'daughter', 'discovered', 'title', 'public', 'library', 'watching', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'get', 'copy', 'home', 'library', 'Dubbed', 'English', '2010', 'French', 'animated', 'feature', 'pure', 'delight', 'beginning', 'till', 'end', 'story', 'cops', 'robbers', 'burglar', 'story', 'deft', 'narrative', 'devices', 'beautiful', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'elevate', 'regular', 'cartoon', 'feature.Set', 'Paris', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'English', 'dub', 'Lauren', 'Weintraub', 'who', 'widowed', 'police', 'commissair', 'mother', 'Jeanne', 'English', 'dub', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'cat', 'shadowing', 'burglar', 'named', 'Nico', 'English', 'dub', 'Steven', 'Blum', 'when', 'cat', 'Zo', 'eacute', ""'present"", 'form', 'bracelet', 'Jeanne', 'bracelet', 'might', 'be', 'tied', 'spate', 'burglaries', 'area', 'Jeanne', 'team', 'are', 'trail', 'notorious', 'criminal', 'named', 'Victor', 'Costa', 'English', 'dub', 'JD', 'Blanc', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'Jeanne', 'husband', 'death.The', 'story', 'moves', 'fast', 'pace', 'kept', 'interest', 'plot', 'engaging', 'peopled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'benign', 'sinister', 'daughter', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'loved', 'Zo', 'eacute', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Nico', 'was', 'little', 'afraid', 'certain', 'nail-biting', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely.The', 'feature', '62', 'minutes', 'full', 'color', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'Many', 'Lives', 'Cat', 'Video', 'Flipbook', 'Extinction', 'Saber-Toothed', 'Housecat', 'Bonus', 'Short', 'FilmAlternate', 'Original', 'French', 'Audio', 'Track', 'English', 'SubtitlesU.S', 'Trailer']",A Cat in Paris [Region 4]
