1639297,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00BUQ14O4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 3]","Dermot Mulroney is one of those faces we've seen in scores of film and TV products.  It's likeable enough.  It's honest enough.  It's even wholesome enough.  It's a face we can easily see attached to almost any kind of project - big studio stuff and/or indie flicks - and he has the kind of presence audiences can easily embrace.  We want to root for the guy.  We want him to succeed at whatever he's doing.  We want to see him make it big.And, yes, I'd have to say that's probably the biggest and best reason to sit through THE RAMBLER, clearly an attempt at some experimental narrative written and directed by Calvin Reeder.  While some might try to convince you that THE RAMBLER is the bee's knees (Google it, kids!), I'd have to go the other way and say that aside from some small, independent moments wrapped up in the greater film there really isn't all that much to get excited about here.  That's a disappointment, but sometimes a film is a film is a film ... I'm not sure what this is.  Or was.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then this ain't it!  I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)The Rambler (played by Dermot Mulroney) was just released from prison, and, once he realizes he's living no life at all back home with his unfaithful `gal pal' and his trailer-park-trash `buddies.'  Seeking out something better, he launches out on a cross-country journey to re-unite with his long-lost brother, but, along the way, he'll encounter an increasingly bizarre cast of characters that impart their own unique version of wisdom and life lessons.Unfortunately, the principle problem with THE RAMBLER is that it presents itself as a macabre road movie, one where our narrator - the unnamed Rambler himself - appears to be on some personal quest.  Heroes who go on such a soul-searching must have first and foremost a goal that doesn't only translate to a destination but also something that resembles a personal revelation or epiphany.  For all the freakishly weird stops along the way, the Rambler really makes none.  In fact, the only epiphany he experiences is in the final frames, and it's something the audience knew all along.  Given that narrative framework, then we should've seen him progressing naturally toward this understanding along the way, but writer/director Calvin Lee Reeder serves up his central protagonist/antagonist in too deadpan a presentation for us to really `feel' much less `identify' any growth.Instead, Mulroney takes the viewers on what more closely resembles a bad drug trip, complete with paranoid delusions and hallucinations.  Little of this makes any sense - as I suspect was intended - and there are plenty of indications early on that it was never intended to be.  There's plenty of visual and audible trickery present early on, and, since it comes without any context, the audience must make up its own mind about what it all means.  But the big giveaway for me was in a scene that takes place outside the pawn shop where the Rambler finds employment; two ladies are `testing out' a sawed off shotgun that fire - gets this - four times without a single reload.  From that point, I knew well and good that what I was about to see was entirely fictional - a dreamworld captured on celluloid.  Sure, the crackling and static screens were early indicators, but outright silliness showed me that none of this was real.When you can see the seams, then what you're watching comes apart pretty quickly.  ""Have you ever seen Frankenstein?"" (It's a line of dialogue from late in the picture.)  Precisely.  With Frankenstein, you could always see the seams.THE RAMBLER is produced by Also Known As Pictures, Brooklyn Reptyle Films, WindowLight Pictures, and XYZ Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Anchor Bay Films.  As for the technical specifications, this indie snooze looks and sounds actually very impressive; there's a wealth of sequences in here that - in all seriousness - might be worth further study by students of films or even folks thinking about getting started on some experimental video project.  (As is often the case, I can see there was talent behind and beyond the camera; I'm just immeasurably disappointed that this one didn't add up to anything more significant.)  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of ... not Cliff Notes to explain what it all meant ... nor a director's apology.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  If you're watching closely, then it becomes apparently real soon that THE RAMBLER is little more than a filmmaker's experiment with narrative: it starts with little meaning, it continues losing cohesiveness as the film plods from one stark experience to the next, and it ends pretty much where you figured it would, all symbolizing nothing or - some academic would have you believe - exactly what you think it does.  Don't look for it to make any sense (or stick whatever meaning you want in there!), and you might find something to enjoy, though I'd be hard pressed to suggest what that is.  Aside from some impressive visuals and a clearly David Lynch inspired story, I thought THE RAMBLER only rambled on for far too long.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay Films provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE RAMBLER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,THE RAMBLER Rambles Incessantly,1371945600,"06 23,

1639300,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00BUQ14O4,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 1]","I've seen a flurry of films lately that defy classification.  This is not a bad thing, either; this simply means they are so broad in scope and/or vision that they are hard to stick into a single genre.  THE RAMBLER is definitely one of those films.  Filled with vivid surrealism and near hallucinogenic themes, this film is one you must see to believe.  Part thriller, part drama, part dark-comedy, and part horror, it is an epic trip into madness and beyond.Watching this film caused memories of years past to bubble to the surface in my brain.  Specifically, memories of watching films like David Lynch's BLUE VELVET and Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  I can see subtle influences of both directors in this one.  But whether homage or mimicry, the result is a wild yet vastly entertaining powerhouse of a film.THE RAMBLER is shot very well, although some of the camerawork looks as if the cinematographer was tripping on acid at the time it was done.  Again, this is not a bad thing...if anything, it heightens the exotic mood of the film.  It is noteworthy to mention for those who fancy such stylized material.The acting is top notch as well, with Dermot Mulroney leading a bizarre but talented cast.  I first saw Mulroney's work way back in the late 80s with his portrayal of Dirty Steve Stephens in YOUNG GUNS, and I have enjoyed it ever since.  Co-star Lindsay Pulsipher, who fans of TRUE BLOOD will recognize as were-panther Crystal Norris, does an excellent job as well; she portrays The Girl, a semi-real love interest The Rambler interacts with on his journeys.  The rest of the cast is great, too, a wide and varied group of individuals that help to create the insane world The Rambler inhabits.My sole complaint about THE RAMBLER is that it offers no explanation as to what in the hell is actually going on in the film.  I really enjoyed the movie experience overall, because it is wonderfully bizarre and equally vivid...but the lack of exposition left me scratching my head at the end.  Maybe I missed some symbolism, or maybe it's meant to be open to interpretation without any cues; I'm not sure either way.  This is not a huge detraction for me, but I do feel it is worth mentioning.Still, THE RAMBLER is a fascinating film to watch.  It's almost a step-by-step guide into madness.  It also has some amazing gore, an aspect which I was surprised to see.  I recommend giving this one a look, if anything to see just how far down the rabbit hole it might take you.

It begins with a solitary character who has kept himself to himself during his time in prison, when he is released he tries to return to his old life, but things quickly don't work out so heads across country to his estranged brother's ranch.The film is all about the journey and along the way he experiences some strange encounters and some very odd characters. It has a similar vibe to Jacob's Ladder with the cowboy trying to progress with his life, but with horrible visions intruding. The people he encounters are fantastic characters, the mad scientist who has built a device that can record dreams and the taxi driver at the end stood out for me.Everyone in the cast performs well with their roles, the lead in particular plays the solid character with an effective performance.

1639302,A3D28SE0H060MU,B00BUQ14O4,Ryan,"[3, 4]","This sophomore feature from filmmaker Calvin Reeder solidifies his stature as a blatant David Lynch copycat. From the jarring editing and a nonsensical narrative to the surreal characters and dream-like situations, The Rambler doesn't just seem to borrow from films like Mulholland Dr. and Lost Highway as much as poorly imitate. Like The Oregonian, Reeder's first feature, The Rambler is purposefully confounding in both narrative and the unconventional yet intentionally jarring manner in which the story is presented. Even the worst of Lynch was more interesting and more coherent than this muddled misstep, but fans of experimental horror may enjoy the unsettling images and editing compiled in The Rambler. Others may find that this 99 minute film feels much, much longer.The basic plot of The Rambler seems impossibly simple, and perhaps this is because the feature film is actually based on a 12 minute short that Reeder completed in 2008. Dermot Mulroney stars as the nameless rambler, on his way cross country to work with his brother on a horse ranch after being released from prison early for good behavior. He makes a brief appearance back home, but after discovering the unfaithfulness of his wife and the bleakness of this existence, he makes plans to join his brother for a peaceful existence in Oregon.This peace is not easily found, as the rambler quickly discovers how quickly random violence occurs on the road. As he hitches rides across the country with his guitar in tow, rarely seeming to lose his hat and never parting with his sunglasses, this expressionless traveler comes across a cornucopia of quirky characters that range from harmless to homicidal. Oddly combining both of these attributes is the film's more compelling character, a mad professor played by James Cady. He has a device which is said to copy dreams onto VHS, but it has a bad habit of exploding the subject's heads instead.This type of shock gore occurs randomly throughout The Rambler, as it did in Reeder's debut, but I would not place in the category of horror. It seems an appreciation of horror may be necessary to enjoy this film, however, if enjoyment is indeed intended. There is a sincerity missing from Reeder's material, which makes it difficult to tell whether this film is intended to have meaning or simply meant to aggravate and infuriate the audience. Or perhaps the filmmaker has no clue what any of it means, choosing to stylistically steal from other directors without figuring out what any of it means. Honestly, I could care less either way. Sincere or not, I didn't enjoy The Rambler, but that has less to do with the gore or confounding filmmaking. By the end I was just bored. This material was better suited for 12 minutes.The Blu-ray is void of special features, though there are technical aspects of the filmmaking which are inarguably enhanced by high definition. You don't have to like it to appreciate the talent that went behind the nonsense.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW AND MORE, VISIT [...][...]",3,Real Movie News review,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3021,"['sophomore', 'feature', 'filmmaker', 'Calvin', 'Reeder', 'stature', 'blatant', 'David', 'Lynch', 'copycat', 'jarring', 'editing', 'nonsensical', 'narrative', 'surreal', 'characters', 'dream-like', 'situations', 'Rambler', ""n't"", 'just', 'seem', 'borrow', 'films', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'as', 'much', 'poorly', 'imitate', 'Oregonian', 'Reeder', 'first', 'feature', 'Rambler', 'purposefully', 'confounding', 'narrative', 'unconventional', 'yet', 'intentionally', 'jarring', 'manner', 'story', 'presented', 'Even', 'worst', 'Lynch', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'coherent', 'muddled', 'misstep', 'fans', 'experimental', 'horror', 'may', 'enjoy', 'unsettling', 'images', 'editing', 'compiled', 'Rambler', 'Others', 'may', 'find', '99', 'minute', 'film', 'feels', 'much', 'much', 'longer.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Rambler', 'impossibly', 'simple', 'perhaps', 'feature', 'film', 'actually', 'based', '12', 'minute', 'short', 'Reeder', 'completed', '2008', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'nameless', 'rambler', 'way', 'cross', 'country', 'work', 'brother', 'horse', 'ranch', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'early', 'good', 'behavior', 'brief', 'appearance', 'back', 'home', 'discovering', 'unfaithfulness', 'wife', 'bleakness', 'existence', 'plans', 'join', 'brother', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'Oregon.This', 'peace', 'not', 'easily', 'found', 'rambler', 'quickly', 'how', 'quickly', 'random', 'violence', 'occurs', 'road', 'rides', 'country', 'guitar', 'tow', 'rarely', 'seeming', 'lose', 'hat', 'never', 'parting', 'sunglasses', 'expressionless', 'traveler', 'cornucopia', 'quirky', 'characters', 'range', 'harmless', 'homicidal', 'Oddly', 'combining', 'attributes', 'film', 'more', 'compelling', 'character', 'mad', 'professor', 'played', 'James', 'Cady', 'device', 'said', 'copy', 'dreams', 'VHS', 'bad', 'habit', 'exploding', 'subject', 'heads', 'instead.This', 'type', 'shock', 'gore', 'randomly', 'Rambler', 'did', 'Reeder', 'debut', 'would', 'not', 'place', 'category', 'horror', 'appreciation', 'horror', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'enjoyment', 'indeed', 'intended', 'sincerity', 'missing', 'Reeder', 'material', 'difficult', 'tell', 'film', 'intended', 'have', 'meaning', 'simply', 'meant', 'aggravate', 'infuriate', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'filmmaker', 'clue', 'what', 'choosing', 'stylistically', 'steal', 'other', 'directors', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'Honestly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'way', 'Sincere', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Rambler', 'less', 'do', 'gore', 'confounding', 'filmmaking', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'bored', 'material', 'was', 'better', 'suited', '12', 'minutes.The', 'Blu-ray', 'void', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'technical', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'are', 'inarguably', 'enhanced', 'high', 'definition', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'went', 'nonsense.FOR', 'THE', 'REST', 'THE', 'REVIEW', 'AND', 'MORE', 'VISIT', '[', ']', '[', ']']",The Rambler
