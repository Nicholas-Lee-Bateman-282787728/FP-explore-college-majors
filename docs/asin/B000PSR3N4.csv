Since I am in the U.S. and the DVD is formatted for England/Europe I watched it on my computer.  I can only do that 4 times according to the computer so I watched the whole 3 hour DVD at one time (rather than break into two nights and thereby use up 2 of my 4 opportunities.  Kind of like the three wishes from a genie---you don't want to waste a wish!)  The location shots were amazing and the story was gripping.  John (Richard Armitage) is not the dashing handsome character we are used to seeing Richard play but he stole my heart anyway.  The story ends in tragedy but you hope that the surviving characters will be able to rise above it all and carry on.  I was just thinking of using one of my &#34;wishes&#34; and watching it again.  I will have to invest in a multi-region DVD player sooner or later in order to view more of Mr. Armitage's work.",4,Early Armitage,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,972,"['would', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'work', 'was', 'eager', 'view', 'see', 'early', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'am', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'formatted', 'England/Europe', 'watched', 'computer', 'can', 'only', 'do', '4', 'times', 'according', 'computer', 'so', 'watched', 'whole', '3', 'hour', 'DVD', 'one', 'time', 'rather', 'break', 'two', 'nights', 'thereby', 'use', '2', '4', 'opportunities', 'Kind', 'three', 'wishes', 'genie', '-you', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'wish', 'location', 'shots', 'were', 'amazing', 'story', 'was', 'gripping', 'John', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'not', 'dashing', 'handsome', 'character', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'play', 'stole', 'heart', 'anyway', 'story', 'tragedy', 'hope', 'surviving', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'rise', 'carry', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', 'using', 'one', '34', 'wishes', '34', 'watching', 'again', 'will', 'have', 'invest', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'sooner', 'later', 'order', 'view', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Armitage', 'work']",Sparkhouse [Regions 2 & 4]

Why isn't it available in US format?  BBC needs to understand that Richard Armitage's fans are legion and ravenous for more, more, more.The novel Wuthering Heights is a real downer of a read, parts of it are gripping but the rest is wilderness and madness, like the moors itself.  Plus, necrophilia and inter-generational inbreeding are not very romantic when you come right down to it.  That being said, this rework of Bronte's story is set  in the present with some post-modern sex changes.  Heathcliff's character is embodied in Carol (Sarah Smart), Cathy becomes Andrew (Joe McFaddlen) and John Standring (Richard Armitage) is an amalgam of the doomed siblings, Isabella and Edgar Hareton.  The Heathcliff character works really well as a female role but Cathy's repression and hysteria don't translate as well for a male part.  For all you 3S BBC Robin Hood fans, there is a special treat, Holly Grainger (the actress who plays Meg) as a teenager!And yes, RA is good in it, although his body language and appearance are quite different than the heroic Mr. ThorntonNorth & Southor the sadistic Sir GuyRobin Hood: Seasons 1-2.  This was made in 2002 (RA is a beardless brunette) and since that time he has matured quite nicely in my opinion!!  Beware, this searing tragedy has gripping performances all the way round and it is almost impossible to quit watching it so plan to allot three hours before you start.",5,Riveting rework of Wuthering Heights,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1607,"['Was', 'forced', 'watch', 'mini-series', 'Youtube', '10', 'minutes', 'clip', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'actually', 'helped', 'translate', 'accents', 'several', 'characters', 'am', 'used', 'RP', 'English', 'Why', ""n't"", 'available', 'US', 'format', 'BBC', 'understand', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'fans', 'are', 'legion', 'ravenous', 'more', 'more', 'more.The', 'novel', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'real', 'downer', 'read', 'parts', 'are', 'gripping', 'rest', 'wilderness', 'madness', 'moors', 'necrophilia', 'inter-generational', 'inbreeding', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'romantic', 'when', 'come', 'right', 'down', 'being', 'said', 'rework', 'Bronte', 'story', 'set', 'present', 'post-modern', 'sex', 'changes', 'Heathcliff', 'character', 'embodied', 'Carol', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Cathy', 'Andrew', 'Joe', 'McFaddlen', 'John', 'Standring', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'amalgam', 'doomed', 'siblings', 'Isabella', 'Edgar', 'Hareton', 'Heathcliff', 'character', 'really', 'well', 'female', 'role', 'Cathy', 'repression', 'hysteria', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'as', 'well', 'male', 'part', '3S', 'BBC', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'fans', 'special', 'treat', 'Holly', 'Grainger', 'actress', 'who', 'Meg', 'teenager', 'yes', 'RA', 'good', 'body', 'language', 'appearance', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'heroic', 'Mr.', 'ThorntonNorth', 'Southor', 'sadistic', 'Sir', 'GuyRobin', 'Hood', 'Seasons', '1-2', 'was', 'made', '2002', 'RA', 'beardless', 'brunette', 'time', 'matured', 'quite', 'nicely', 'opinion', 'Beware', 'searing', 'tragedy', 'gripping', 'performances', 'way', 'round', 'almost', 'impossible', 'quit', 'watching', 'so', 'plan', 'allot', 'three', 'hours', 'start']",Sparkhouse [Regions 2 & 4]

1072848,A1OVF0KSZZRTEV,B000PSR3N4,R. L. Cobleigh,"[0, 0]","Carol is a strong character, a woman who has had to deal with serious hardships in her life and mistreatment by her father and boyfriend and neglect by her mother, all whilst caring for her younger sister and enduring the ostracization of her community. Although the main &#34;love story&#34; portrayed in this movie is between Carol and Andrew, it doesn't work for me at all. Andrew is a self-absorbed, immature idiot. I spend most of his time on screen pretending that I'm squishing his head between my fingers, just to get through his scenes, because he's such a waste of time.Happily, Richard Armitage plays John, the only really good man in the whole situation, and in my mind, John and Carol are the *real* love story. Although the ending isn't an obviously happy one, at least it ends on a hopeful note, leaving the door open for Carol to finally be able to build a healthy life for herself.Excellent acting from all involved. If you like Wuthering Heights, you'll probably find this movie an interesting twist on the theme.

1072849,A2DEJDJLNG2ZO9,B000PSR3N4,"Stephanie B. Carr ""catseyez""","[0, 0]","Be forewarned--some of this miniseries is not easy to watch and the main character tends to be somewhat unlikeable at the best of moments.  That said, I began watching this very late one night with the intention of seeing only the first part and was mesmerized to the point that I stayed up until some ungodly hour to see the whole thing.  The two leads are well matched for the most part, but some of the acting is a little too histrionic and over the top.  Better service is done by several of the supporting players; an almost unrecognizable (at first) Richard Armitage in one of his very early roles will break your heart as the good guy, Celia Imrie as the betrayed wife, and finally a very young Holiday (now Holly) Grainger as the daughter will also tug at your heartstrings (Robin Hood fans will recognize her from Season 3).Also, for those of you who have not yet purchased a regionless DVD player, prices have come down considerably and believe me--it's more than worth it.

Otherwise, well, it's okay.The two leads who love each other and simultaneously drive each other mad get a bit tiresome.  She's White Trash, and he's a whiny Rich Kid who does stupid things like banging his head against brick walls (no, really).  HE is the worst character, as he doesn't want WT to be with anyone else, yet he's married to another woman.  SHE is almost as bad, leading another guy along (that would be Richard Armitage; she even proposes to him, and then she marries him), while she pines for her REAL love, Rich Kid.  Sound confusing?
