Each actor/actress is given a storyline which really suits them.  Most of the time, it seems, the main characters are Harm and Mac (David James Elliott and Catherine Bell).  Their chemistry is amazing.  I love this series for actors and the storylines but also because alot of the storylines are derived from real life events.  The storylines are interesting and the show got better as it went along.

So I am hoping that I don't have to wait several years until I have the full 10 season collection.Some things that I did not like so much in the season 2 box was, that there was no booklet included. I think, with a cult series like JAG, one could have put some effort into creating a nice booklet with maybe air-dates and some background information (as they did with ""The X-Files"").Also I hope that maybe the next sets will include more specials like bloopers, interviews with the cast, etc.Aside of that I have to say that those JAG sets are the most beautiful I have in my collection of TV-series.

He's more irritating and arrogant than charming.With regards to family friendly, I'd have to point out to others who may consider buying this for kid viewing, two couples have premarital sex and while it's not the least bit explicit (you don't see anything), it's obvious what they do from the scenes before and after and it is presented as natural and welcome.
