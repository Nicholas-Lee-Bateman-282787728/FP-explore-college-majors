900824,AJWMVSLEVJ1UP,B00093GVWY,Alan W. Petrucelli,"[23, 23]","Ralph Edwards' breakthrough series that showcased the extraordinary lives of famous folk has finally been brought to the small screen again. And we couldn't be happier. This three-disc collection features 18 tributes, and spans a variety of genres, decades and honorees. Our favorites, of course, come from the haze of Hollywood, and include Bette Davis (the reunion between she and Now, Voyager star Paul Henried, who recreates the film's legendary ""two cigarette"" finale, is stirring; Boris Karloff (the renowned actor is reunited with his Frankenstein make-up guru Jack Piece); Lou Costello (who refuses to shy away from the overwhelming grief over his young son drowning in the family pool) and Jayne Mansfield (whose honest emotionality belies her dumb blonde status). Yet the tales of the lesser-known World War survivors, Pearl Harbor hero Rear Admiral Samuel Fuqua and Holocaust survivor Hanna Bloch Kohner, are equally riveting. This remains an incredible piece of TV history that demands to be in everyone's home library, and we fervently hope that Ralph Edwards productions and R2 will release the rest of the shows.

It finally came, and when I popped it into my 1.5 year old DVD player, none of the disks in this set would play on a Toshiba player. I had to take them to another player I have, a newer one, a Panasonic.THAT is scary. Still, I like the set.You don't even have to like some of the stars on these disks; just seeing their reactions, their horror at being on ""This Is Your Life"", and their sometimes disingenuous reactions to people is great fun.It is also sad to see some of these people who are no longer with us, such as Karen Carpenter and Jayne Mansfield. Karen appeared to be just an innocent, wide-eyed, all-American girl who rocketed to fame, only to die too soon. What a cutie. And Jayne really ""played"" her assets on TV, but you can tell that under the glitzy surface was a woman who cared about her family...and who was anything but dumb.And there is Jack Cassidy, the ""hammy"" husband of Shirley Jones, and somebody who also died too soon.Still, these are fascinating glimpses into the private lives of famous people. They sometimes look uncomfortable, there are lots and lots of pregnant pauses as people stumble for words.Recommended, but...with caution.",4,"Nice, But Be Careful...",1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1211,"['waited', 'great', 'anticipation', 'set', 'finally', 'came', 'when', 'popped', '1.5', 'year', 'old', 'DVD', 'player', 'none', 'disks', 'set', 'would', 'play', 'Toshiba', 'player', 'had', 'take', 'player', 'have', 'newer', 'one', 'Panasonic.THAT', 'scary', 'Still', 'like', 'set.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'like', 'stars', 'disks', 'just', 'seeing', 'reactions', 'horror', 'being', 'Your', 'Life', 'sometimes', 'disingenuous', 'reactions', 'people', 'great', 'fun.It', 'also', 'sad', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'such', 'Karen', 'Carpenter', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'Karen', 'appeared', 'be', 'just', 'innocent', 'wide-eyed', 'all-American', 'girl', 'who', 'rocketed', 'fame', 'only', 'die', 'too', 'soon', 'What', 'cutie', 'Jayne', 'really', 'played', 'assets', 'TV', 'can', 'tell', 'glitzy', 'surface', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'cared', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'anything', 'dumb.And', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'hammy', 'husband', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'somebody', 'who', 'also', 'died', 'too', 'soon.Still', 'are', 'fascinating', 'glimpses', 'private', 'lives', 'famous', 'people', 'sometimes', 'look', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'lots', 'lots', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'people', 'stumble', 'words.Recommended', 'caution']","This Is Your Life - The Ultimate Collection, Vol. 1"
