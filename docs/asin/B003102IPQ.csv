It was kind of unique how the director interviews the ""real person"" (who's obviously just an actress), and how it has a double-screen effect when it shows the film and the ""real"" footage. I have to say, parts of the film were actually scary, like when you hear the alien and those ""abduction"" scenes. It seems like the director really wanted us to believe that it was real. In some ways, it kind of worked, but it ultimately didn't work. It just looked fabricated. The movie didn't end well either.

I can't watch scary movies after a certain time of day, because they give me nightmares. Unfortunately for me, I watched this movie too late because I had low expectations and didn't expect it to scare me. The good news: no nightmares. The bad news: I was awake staring at the door in fear until the sun came up.While I was pretty sure from the start that the claims of real life footage being in the movie were bogus, it still scared the crap outta me. But the promise of ""archival footage"" even though it really wasn't annoyed me, so I deducted some points for that.It starts a little slow but once it gets going it's definitely a good scary movie in my opinion.

There were multiple descriptions of something I witnessed 10+ years ago.I saw a low flying aircraft that was following alongside the road I was on. It was a populated area, so it really caught my attention before I was anywhere near it. I thought it might be a search helicopter or a pilot in trouble. I was close to home so I became very concerned that something major was going on. I thought there might be a dangerous fugitive or an impending plane crash, and I was very worried about my family.It suddenly stopped, so I turned my car around and pulled into a parking lot. It was right there, hovering above the buildings and trees. It was large and rectangular with a flat underside. There was a white/yellow downward spotlight, and it had had smaller lights as well (I think at least one was red). I saw it perfectly clear and I was awestruck.Then it suddenly went from standing still to rushing away. I went home, ran inside and plastered myself to our picture window. There were three lights moving away in the distance, and they were so bright that I was able to see them for about 30 minutes before they were too far away to be visible.I have no idea if those phone recording are real or fake, but it definitely blew my mind to hear a word-for-word description of what I saw!

However, I completely disagree with all of them.  Perhaps the overwhelming negativity lowered my expectations enough to let me enjoy, but I certainly did. To enjoy it, however, expectations need to be aligned with reality.  This movie is far more about the humans, who may or may not have had an alien encounter, than the actual aliens themselves. Don't expect an Alien(s)-like movie with intense special effects, monsters or other traditional hollywood flair. This is a documentary-like account of Nome, Alaska and the experiences of several of its citizens. Much of the film is told through actual footage (audio and video) of interviews with the people alleging to have these experiences, as well as police car cameras catching certain footage. Throughout, it centers on a psychologist who identifies a theme among several of her clients, whom she leads into a hypnotic state and thereby uncovers latent memories, very often to the intense horror of the hypnotee.  In the beginning and the end, the movie asserts that every fact presented in the movie is substantiated by eyewitness accounts and other verifiable information, and encourages the viewer to draw their own conclusions. And there certainly is room for interpretation; as the film evolves, some of the characters demonstrate less than full reliability and believability in their accounts. Nonetheless, the evidence for the existence and, frankly, malfeasance of aliens is compelling.  Further, the movie overall was very effective in its storytelling. It was eerie and spooky nearly throughout with believable performances (from the recreations), etc.  Very highly recommended._----I've now reconsidered my opinion.  I no longer endorse this film.  Apparently the entire film is a blatant fabrication, despite the movie's introductory assertions to the contrary.  I understand they created websites that appear authentic, but are not, and there is no record of the psychologist ever practicing in Alaska.  At least Blair Witch didn't make overt promises about the truth of what it showed; this went to great lengths to convince the audience that it was real.

Still, I wanted to see it.  I am often disappointed in these alien films, but my search for something truly terrifying usually leads me to at least watch it once.""If I could turn back time...""Elements within `The Fourth Kind' actually work, and at times they even work well, but overall the clunky and phony feeling to the film leaves the audience rather detached and uninterested.  We can address the big pink elephant in the room right on and just say that this film is as `true' as `The Blair Witch Project' was, and so all the constant claims to authenticity are obnoxious and irritating.  I didn't need Wikipedia to tell me that this film was a phony (although it did tell me).  The supposed `actual footage' is so forced looking and the actual supposed alien possession scenes are completely CGI'd (especially the last one).  The film tries very hard to convince you that this is all real, but as the actors say on the outset, what you believe is up to you and there is no way I believe a word of this film.  So, with all the `this is real, be very afraid' hoopla, it became apparent that the writers didn't think hard enough about constructing a coherent plot.  The film just kind of meanders and wobbles on its unsteady legs.  Some scenes contain truly terrifying moments, but they are masked over by overworked segments of force-fed foolery.I love you Milla Jovovich, but you really need to get your act together.I think that `The Fourth Kind' is a case of `too much'.  It just throws way too much at you.  It tries to convince you that the footage it presents is `real', but the overall flow of the film is far too clean to produce any genuine terror.  There needed to be grittiness, even to the supposed reenactment scenes, and yet the film is polished and crisp in texture, which takes you out of the `realness' it is trying to present.  A lot of the scenes feel overproduced and underdeveloped, especially when the screen is split in fours and your struggling to watch every angle of something that really only needed one angle to begin with.  Placing the `footage' side by side with the `reenactments' only shone a light on the scale of bad acting used in this film.Nothing is convincing.Alas, there was an hour and half (or so) of my time wasted.

Soon she discover that several of her patients tell the same and very disturbing tales of seeing a white owl outside their window.

The movie shifts between film footage and what is claimed to be real life footage, the result can get rather creepy at times, and that is what this movie excel at, it is scary, the whole this is real explanation makes it rather creepy. The movie do not have much blood and gore, but it uses sounds, lighting and camera work very effectively.

The pepole in this film are characters, not real pepole. Unfortunately such scams hurt the credibility of real UFO phenomena. This movie tries to take a Blair Witch, claiming it had real footage, it do not, the woman in the interview is an actress, the story of this movie is pure fiction.

People living in the most remote places, such as the Congo and the jungles of South America, with no access to movies and TV have reported these type of encounters. And throughout history, as shown in the movie, there have been stories in folklore and also depicted in ancient art that seem to also describe alien abduction. Claiming to use real footage of a Nome, Alaska psychologist's interviews and hypnotic sessions, The Fourth Kind initially stirred as much interest as the similarly marketed Blair Witch Project. But after diligent research, and a lawsuit, its finally come out that the actual events the movie are based on are fiction. While Nome really has had an abnormally high number of deaths and disappearances, the FBI thinks that alcohol and the extreme climate are to blame. The surrounding villages are ""dry"" and unlike the wooded mountainous settings in the movie, Nome is surrounded by a flat landscape. But that doesn't mean its a bad movie, not at all. I found The Fourth Kind to be a much more scary movie then the other highly hyped 2009 horror movieParanormal Activity (2-Disc Digital Copy Edition) [Blu-ray]. The unknown can be terrifying and in this movie, being taken from your bed by alien entities is portraited in a very convincing manner. And while the underlying story is not true, the movie uses many details that actual abductees report. A putrid cinnamon smell, remembering an animal outside their window (in the movie its an owl), and strange wounds are all claimed to be experienced by real abductees and shown in the movie. Channeling aliens under hypnosis, as far as I know, is unique to the movie and used as a tool to help tell the story.

There is much shock value in that the amaturish recordings of what supposedly actually took place are far more interesting than the parallel recreation by the Hollywood actors. The main character played by Milla Jovovich and the director of the movie are in a sequence (out of character) and simply outright lie to the viewer that what they have witnessed is true and ""believe what you like"", but here are the FBI statistics, blah, blah blah. This somewhat ruined the experience, because if some of the things took place in real life, they would have made front page news of every city across the globe. It would not be possible for anyone to hide what is portrayed in this movie.Although there are serious holes in the plot, the movie is reasonably well acted and the pace is good. There are some obvious logical flaws in the actions that take place (like many thriller type movies), and some of these are extreme. The fundimental flaw I noticed right from the beginning is that a psychologist or any other mental health professional would probably not be allowed to continue treating patients when their husband had just been murdered in front of them (but not really) and said mental health professional was unable to explain or understand what had happened.

1316485,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B003102IPQ,bunnyrabbit4,"[1, 2]","For a good scare, see the movie first and then read my review!!! I don't scare easily but this one had me. It's worth your buck as long as you don't know much about it.Take one of the few monsters many people believe are real, show them torturing (apparently in real footage) innocent, defenseless people and you have one scary movie. Once you read that while some of the audio is real (Which Parts, How much?) the video is not, you aren't so scared. The inhumanly open mouths and arched backs aren't real, so what's left? Well, how about motive? What possible motivations might these ""aliens"" have? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't even ask this question.Without the scary footage and your belief that it is real, this movie just doesn't make sense. What possible reason would aliens have for torturing people while lecturing to them in Ancient Sumerian? Can we believe that such a highly advanced civilization lacks the ability to speak English? Why can't they come up with something more believable to say to a woman with a PHD than ""I am God your savior""? If this really happened, the answers to these questions seem more pressing than the portrayal of suffering humans.""The Fourth Kind"" does not seem to be about any alien abduction I've ever heard of. What it does remind me of was a rogue chapter in an otherwise good book on UFO's  by Phillip Imbrogno's, called ""Interdimensional Universe: The New Science of UFOs, Paranormal Phenomena and Other dimensional Beings"". With the exception of that one chapter his compilation of abduction case histories was quite believable. The chapter in question referred to ""demon"" aliens who spoke backwards, (a scare technique first used in the movie ""The Exorcist"") and looked like giant Lizards. During that investigation of a woman and her daughter (also living in a rural area) who were being threatened by these creatures, men in black appeared and several of Imbrogno's fellow researchers died. It made me ask who would want to use these techniques, against whom, and why? Like the ""demon alien"" chapter, the movie makes no attempt to explain ""why"" or indulge in any real plot resolution beyond the idea that they are ""evil"". But don't evil people have motives too?I would say that whatever is happening in Alaska has the same origin as what happened in Imbrogno's case. What it smacks of is not aliens, but some sort of high tech military operation to which they have yet to recruit a good screen writer. Aren't these the same people who once subjected soldiers to radiation to see what would happen and gave equally unsuspecting recruits LSD?My guess is that whoever is behind the abuses taking place in Alaska has graduated from speaking backwards to speaking ancient Sumerian. They are better at torture than plot lines and seem content with the fact that their visits cause people to commit suicide and murder thier kin out of fear. You get your enemy to kill himself without any apparent human interaction! Who would benefit from using that? Real aliens would have no trouble killing us if they wanted to, they could scare us to death just by stepping out of a space craft and giving us a dirty look. So why all the dramatics?? If there is an objective here it fits the military better than it does any alien society. Incidentally, Sumerian was a language once spoken in the Middle East.While this movie did not offer any solutions to the problems it presents, it did leave me thinking. If our government can let Wall Street create grossly unfair lending instruments that force millions of American's out of their homes (and is probably responsible for more than a few suicides), why wouldn't they let the military drive a few people out of their minds for a ""good cause"" like national security?

Throughout the entire film we are constantly being reminded that it's a movie. Every time an actor comes into frame, they announce it with subtitles: Will Patton - actor. As if that's not bad enough, the first thing we see is Milla Jovovich standing in the woods somewhere. She proclaims loudly, ""I'm actress, Milla Jovovich,"" then she goes on to explain that we are going to watch a movie and we are going, `Yeah we got that lady, that's why we are here'.Then she tells us that some of the events that we will be viewing are true and that for dramatic purposes actors have been hired to act out those emotional scenes but that they will be played simultaneously along with the real footage. What? Why?And just as she promised, the director uses a split-screen method with the supposed real footage being on the left and the footage with shiny big actors in it on the right. The actors on the right act out nearly everything verbatim that is happening at the exact same time on the left side of the screen. Who in their right mind in Hollywood thought this would be entertaining?The biggest reason that this did not work for me aside from the fact that it was aggravating and beyond boring; was that the actors they hired to act on the right side of the screen, were way better actors than the ones they hired to play the real people who weren't supposed to be acting, on the left side! How am I supposed to believe that the footage on the left is real when Milla Jovovich's adaptation of it is astronomically more impressive and believable? They would have been better off saying that this all really happened to Milla Jovovich and shot it with a home video camera.The film takes place in Nome Alaska. We are told that over the last several years, numerous people have vanished unexplainably. The point behind the film is that supposedly these people were abducted by aliens.Milla Jovovich re-enacts the role of a psychiatrist by the name of Abbey Tyler. We see `real footage' of the person her character is based on, interviewing patients. Her name has been changed of course but there she is right there in front of us on the screen, so what was the point of changing her name? Right.And isn't there some kind of psychiatrist / patient confidentiality clause that protects people from being humiliated? Apparently none of the people on the left side of the screen had a problem with Hollywood glamorizing their violent and no doubt traumatic abductions. Again, right.Tyler's research discloses that several of her patients have reported being awakened in the night at around the same time and having weird visits from spooky owls. What this has to do with the aliens is beyond me.Despite how terribly lame the film is, you get outstanding performances out of Will Patton, Milla Jovovich and another actor that has been overlooked for far too long; Elias Koteas. I get the sense that none of these great actors knew just what the final product was going to look like.I will admit that the director did do some amazing things cinema-graphically on the right side of the screen and the footage they show on the left is pretty creepy at times; but whenever there is an `alien incident' let's call it, the camera conveniently loses focus and is blurred out of our vision and we are left only with screams of horror and shaky camera movements.Oh, and when their spaceship comes, yeah that makes the camera blurry as well. The aliens don't mind that all of this is filmed, because it's obviously fake.... I mean because the cameras get all fuzzy so there is no way they can get caught.

So, the footage is fake.  So what?  I was still creeped out by the movie, and I thought it was entirely entertaining.  The movie adopts a strange style: ""actual footage"" playing side-by-side with reenactment footage during many scenes.  Many will wonder what the purpose of this is.  I have a theory:  the slightly embellished reenactment footage is meant to make the ""actual footage"" appear more realistic in contrast.  Does it work?  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  But, you know what, I knew The Blair Witch Project was bogus when I saw it (and I saw it opening weekend, before the hullabaloo), and it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie at all.  Suspend your disbelief and maybe you'll have a good time.  The purportedly real footage is spooky and fun, and the end of the movie gave me some chills.  I like to think of myself as a reasonably intelligent individual, but I still found myself online after I saw the film in theaters just to make sure there was no truth to it.  So, because of that sliver of doubt, I have to take my hat off to this one.  Of course, if you're a major skeptic about UFOs and Alien Abduction, or you're really not interested in the subject matter, or if you're the type of negative person who likes to pick a movie apart, you'll probably be bored with this movie.

Still mourning the recent death of her husband, Tyler spends her days dealing with an apparent epidemic of insomnia amongst the town's citizens - but as Tyler delves deeper into the nature of her patient's sleep-related maladies, she begins to notice a disturbing number of similarities and correlations between their stories. Why are they all waking at 3:33am? And why are they all seeing owls outside their windows? As time draws on, she enlists the aid of colleague Dr. Abel Compos (Elias Koteas) and slowly begins piecing together fragments of information which suggest a nightmarish truth.I'll admit it, ""The Fourth Kind"" caught me completely off guard; I rented it expecting a mildly entertaining mid-budget thriller fashioned after the likes ofThe X-Files: The Complete Collector's EditionandSteven Spielberg Presents Takenand instead experienced one of the most profoundly scary films that I've seen in a long time. This is no small praise when you consider that I've read a fair number of books and seen a fair number of films and TV shows about UFOs, aliens and abduction phenomena and am completely skeptical about the whole thing (the hard cold figures of Drake's equation negates the possibility of alien contact as far as I'm concerned).While it's true that this film works through every Whitley Strieberesque clich&eacute; in the abduction playbook (screen memories, subliminally buried recollections accessible only through hypnosis, white lights and, hell, even some allusions to the work of Erich Von Daniken), director Olatunde Osunsami innovatively uses a gamut of structural, editing, split-screen and soundtrack techniques in order to draw the viewer into a tapestry of ""dramatically reconstructed events"" which appear alongside ""archival footage"" on which the reconstruction is allegedly based; the net effect of this tinkering with 'levels of reality' is a palpably eerie sense of authenticity which pervades the film and only serves to reinforce the chills that materialise. Situations and clich&eacute;s that you've seen a million times before in a million different movies and TV shows are suddenly thrown into stark relief and become deeply frightening again.Originally, I was only intending to give this film four stars, but it really did get into my head (and impress me with it's innovative structuring) and, frankly, it takes a lot to unnerve and impress me these days, so it gets a round five stars. Seriously, this a film which is both vastly scarier than (and vastly superior too) the massively over-hyped and deeply pedestrianParanormal Activityas well as virtually every other horror film in recent years....And if you consider yourself a jaded old cynic and think that this film can't get into your head, I issue you the following challenge - watch this alone, late at night, with the lights out and the sound way up...and then discover what an interesting prospect going to sleep on your own in the dark becomes.",5,Caught Me Completely Off Guard,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,3126,"['Nome', 'Alaska', 'October', '2000', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'psychologist', 'ministering', 'citizens', 'Nome', 'secluded', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'only', 'accessible', 'air', 'Still', 'mourning', 'recent', 'death', 'husband', 'Tyler', 'days', 'dealing', 'apparent', 'epidemic', 'insomnia', 'town', 'citizens', 'Tyler', 'deeper', 'nature', 'patient', 'sleep-related', 'maladies', 'notice', 'disturbing', 'number', 'similarities', 'correlations', 'stories', 'Why', 'are', 'waking', '3:33am', 'why', 'are', 'seeing', 'owls', 'windows', 'time', 'draws', 'aid', 'colleague', 'Dr.', 'Abel', 'Compos', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'slowly', 'piecing', 'together', 'fragments', 'information', 'suggest', 'nightmarish', 'truth.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'caught', 'completely', 'guard', 'rented', 'expecting', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'mid-budget', 'thriller', 'fashioned', 'likes', 'ofThe', 'X-Files', 'Complete', 'Collector', 'EditionandSteven', 'Spielberg', 'Presents', 'Takenand', 'instead', 'experienced', 'one', 'most', 'profoundly', 'scary', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'small', 'praise', 'when', 'consider', ""'ve"", 'read', 'fair', 'number', 'books', 'seen', 'fair', 'number', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'UFOs', 'aliens', 'abduction', 'phenomena', 'am', 'completely', 'skeptical', 'whole', 'thing', 'hard', 'cold', 'figures', 'Drake', 'equation', 'possibility', 'alien', 'contact', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'true', 'film', 'Whitley', 'Strieberesque', 'clich', 'eacute', 'abduction', 'playbook', 'screen', 'memories', 'subliminally', 'buried', 'recollections', 'accessible', 'only', 'hypnosis', 'white', 'lights', 'hell', 'even', 'allusions', 'work', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'director', 'Olatunde', 'Osunsami', 'innovatively', 'gamut', 'structural', 'editing', 'split-screen', 'soundtrack', 'techniques', 'order', 'draw', 'viewer', 'tapestry', 'dramatically', 'reconstructed', 'events', 'appear', 'archival', 'footage', 'reconstruction', 'allegedly', 'based', 'net', 'effect', 'tinkering', ""'levels"", 'reality', 'palpably', 'eerie', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'film', 'only', 'reinforce', 'chills', 'materialise', 'Situations', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'million', 'different', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'stark', 'relief', 'become', 'deeply', 'frightening', 'again.Originally', 'was', 'only', 'intending', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'head', 'impress', 'innovative', 'structuring', 'frankly', 'lot', 'unnerve', 'impress', 'days', 'round', 'five', 'stars', 'Seriously', 'film', 'vastly', 'scarier', 'vastly', 'superior', 'too', 'massively', 'over-hyped', 'deeply', 'pedestrianParanormal', 'Activityas', 'well', 'virtually', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'recent', 'years', '.And', 'consider', 'jaded', 'old', 'cynic', 'think', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'issue', 'following', 'challenge', 'watch', 'alone', 'late', 'night', 'lights', 'out', 'sound', 'way', 'then', 'discover', 'what', 'interesting', 'prospect', 'going', 'sleep', 'own', 'dark']",N/A

1316502,A1VM6A7HC6CEIH,B003102IPQ,"David Segrove ""DinA""","[2, 3]","The trouble with ""found footage"" movies is that they're hard to pull off well. Most, if not all, are compared to the ""Blair Witch Project"" which was hyped up on the Internet and an almost guaranteed blockbuster beforehand.That said, there has been the occasional success. I loved ""Paranormal Activity"", even though I knew it was staged. It was just real enough to do the intended job (ie scare the crap out of me). ""The Fourth Kind"" didn't have quite the web-hype that ""Blair Witch"" had, though a website or two was created beforehand to lend it legitimacy.Basically, the ""footage"" is a series of videos taken by psychiatrist Abigail Tyler of patients in session. The video is inter cut with ""re-enactments"" of the supposedly real events by some very talented actors including Milla Jovovich, Will Patton and Elias Koteas. The patients all have something in common, a dream or possible hallucination, or real experience in which they all observed an owl looking at them during the night when they woke up. Under hypnosis, the patients all reveal that something very nasty and scary happened to them...this was no owl, it was abduction.The movie's title plays on the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""'s, the ""third"" kind being contact and the ""fourth"" abduction.The movie offers a slightly new take on the ""found footage"" premise. Whether you believe that the videos shot by Tyler are real or not, the cutting back and forth between the grainy ""home movies"" and decent-quality footage gives the eyes (and ears) a break.Without wanting to give away too much, the film follows Tyler's investigation and tries to show evidence of alien abductions. When ""aliens"" are involved, the video shot by Tyler becomes very grainy, sufficiently to not reveal too much, but to show enough, in theory, to make us wonder. The story feels long and drawn-out. Director Olatunde Osunsanmi who also wrote the story which is loosely based on some disappearances in Nome, Alaska, tries too hard to convince us and tries a little too hard to put twists and turns in an attempt (in my humble opinion) to give us that feeling many of us got at the end of ""The Sixth Sense"" when all was revealed. The talent on display tries hard but the story lets them down. Perhaps cinema has evolved too much for this kind of story to work very well, but then I look at ""Paranormal Activity"" and think otherwise.As with other ""footage"" movies, ""The Fourth Kind"" relies on a few good scares. There are a couple of very good scenes that made me jump in my seat, but I felt they were overdue but did not make up for the rest of the film.If you're a UFO / abduction believer then you may quite like this one. For me, it was ""okay"". It wasn't brilliant. I'd certainly watch it on DVD if I picked it up cheaply, but it certainly isn't anywhere close to it's predecessors.

You see, the movie is presented in a documentary / re-enactment sort of way.  At any given time, the 'actual' footage is coincided with the 're-enacted' footage simultaenously.  Interesting enough.  You would think that the raw footage would be a bit more realistic and it does seem pretty believable until the filmakers decided to incorporate the most overused Hollywood horror movie trick in the book.  The mouths on our horrified victims' faces open wider than a Kansas sinkhole.  I mean seriously, how many times have we seen this effect in horror?  It was freaky the first sixty seven hundred times starting with the movie 'The Ring' almost 11 years ago.  But enough is enough.  This alone, is what ruined the movie for me.Other than the wonderful acting, especially from our depressed buggy eyed doctor telling her story on a T.V. special, the movie is decent enough for not having much special effects or action.  Personal accounts of alien abduction alone can send a tingle or two down the old spine.  I do think that the Sheriff's role in the movie was a bit over-dramatic.  He often shoots from the hip relying on coincidence and gut-feeling  rather than solid evidence.  At one point, he flips out and throws a chair through the doctor's bedroom wall.  I thought cops were supposed to be professional?All in all, decent film.  I give it a very high 2.

Imagine if you will, aliens traveling hundreds of millions of miles across space only to sit on tree branches and scare people.Occasionally one of them stops hooting and decides to go inside the house and give the occupants a really goooooood scare. Of course nobody ever remembers anything and they have to be hypnotized into remembering the scary experience which invariably results in screaming, breaking of furniture, and the one I really love is when some dude levitated right off the bed.The video of the man levitating in the air would have been on CNN if it ever happened which it didn't.This is another one I love. The protagonist explains that the aliens sort of beamed her daughter up through the ceiling of the house and through the roof and took her away.If aliens had that kind of technology, then why would they sitting outside peoples houses pretending they were owls? And if they could just beam people up (Scotty), why would they waste time walking around scaring people. Are the sadists? Why wouldn't they just pick some dude out in the country, beam him up quickly and quietly, do their thing, put him back and go. What's with the scaring? (Sells more tickets to stupid people)And finally, because I don't want to wast anymore time on this, in the beginning of the movie the girl says her husband was murdered by someone stabbing him to death, and that she witnessed it. At the end the sheriff says, in the supposedly surprise ending, that he killed himself with a gun. Gee, I guess she really tricked the coroners office, all the police, the doctor who had to give the certificate of death, and everyone else who was surrounded with the death that he had been stabbed. You would think that detail might be important enough for the sheriff to mention to her at the inquest. I guess she had the ""Force"" at the beginning of the movie and used it to make everyone believe her husband was stabbed to death by a stranger when he actually shot  himself. Where was Colombo when he was needed?To sum this one up, it's one boring piece of coprolite. If you liked The Grudge, Blair Witch, and other assorted movies for the dumbed down generation, then you will probably love this.And the very, very, very final word on the movie is: go to google and put in ""The Fourth Kind of Fake"" and see what CNN has to say about the movie.",1,Yawn!!!!!!!,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2457,"['Help', 'owls', 'are', 'coming', 'owls', 'are', 'coming', 'are', 'brain', 'dead', 'moron', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'Imagine', 'will', 'aliens', 'traveling', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'miles', 'space', 'only', 'sit', 'tree', 'branches', 'scare', 'people.Occasionally', 'one', 'hooting', 'decides', 'go', 'house', 'give', 'occupants', 'really', 'goooooood', 'scare', 'course', 'nobody', 'ever', 'anything', 'have', 'be', 'hypnotized', 'remembering', 'scary', 'experience', 'invariably', 'results', 'screaming', 'breaking', 'furniture', 'one', 'really', 'love', 'when', 'dude', 'levitated', 'right', 'bed.The', 'video', 'man', 'levitating', 'air', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'CNN', 'ever', 'happened', 'one', 'love', 'protagonist', 'aliens', 'sort', 'beamed', 'daughter', 'up', 'ceiling', 'house', 'roof', 'took', 'away.If', 'aliens', 'had', 'kind', 'technology', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'sitting', 'outside', 'peoples', 'houses', 'pretending', 'were', 'owls', 'could', 'just', 'beam', 'people', 'up', 'Scotty', 'why', 'would', 'waste', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'scaring', 'people', 'Are', 'sadists', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'pick', 'dude', 'out', 'country', 'beam', 'up', 'quickly', 'quietly', 'do', 'thing', 'put', 'back', 'go', 'What', 'scaring', 'Sells', 'more', 'tickets', 'stupid', 'people', 'finally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wast', 'anymore', 'time', 'beginning', 'movie', 'girl', 'husband', 'was', 'murdered', 'someone', 'stabbing', 'death', 'witnessed', 'end', 'sheriff', 'supposedly', 'surprise', 'ending', 'killed', 'gun', 'Gee', 'guess', 'really', 'tricked', 'coroners', 'office', 'police', 'doctor', 'who', 'had', 'give', 'certificate', 'death', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'was', 'surrounded', 'death', 'had', 'been', 'stabbed', 'would', 'think', 'detail', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'enough', 'sheriff', 'mention', 'inquest', 'guess', 'had', 'Force', 'beginning', 'movie', 'used', 'make', 'everyone', 'believe', 'husband', 'was', 'stabbed', 'death', 'stranger', 'when', 'actually', 'shot', 'Where', 'was', 'Colombo', 'when', 'was', 'needed', 'sum', 'one', 'up', 'one', 'boring', 'piece', 'coprolite', 'liked', 'Grudge', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'other', 'assorted', 'movies', 'dumbed', 'down', 'generation', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'this.And', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'final', 'word', 'movie', 'go', 'google', 'put', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'Fake', 'see', 'what', 'CNN', 'say', 'movie']",N/A

1316509,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003102IPQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 12]","It's a bit frustrating to review a film like THE FOURTH KIND (2009). While I was captivated by the whole style of the thing, it grates on the nerves like the SAW series (though in the first few seconds of attempted ""genuine"" footage, it nearly fooled me - for a second).Milla Jovovich plays Dr. Abigail Tyler, a psychologist in Nome, Alaska. She finds (perhaps because she is seeking) a rash of alien abductions. In the ""real"" footage, cleverly split-screened in a way I haven't seen in a long time, Abbey Tyler is played by a disabled, sickly yet ominous Charlotte Milchard, a British newcomer.We are expected to fall for the premise that Nome is the alien abduction capitol of the world. We are also supposed to believe that Tyler is the brain who discovers all this resident alien evil. The trouble is that with all the star power here (Will Patton, a big favorite of mine, and Elias Koteas) the acting is lazy - 1st-take-crap, I call it - and, well, this chicken needs to rest. Not because it's tired: this chicken's DEAD.At some point in the film, phony ""genuine"" footage shows Tyler being possessed, levitated, face inhumanly distorted as she channels the Voice: it says it is ""God the Father"", and that ""the child"" will never be returned. (This is a reference to Tyler's kidnapped daughter.) The whole thing may be a bit shivery so close to Halloween, but that is about it: cheap Halloween thrills close to Halloween.It was more fun to sneak into the cemetery at midnight when I was a kid. This movie is stupid in the extreme, yet it takes the viewer a few minutes to understand he's being had at every minute. I have to give credit to a movie that can be this dumb and yet appear to be this cool. In some ways it is very advanced. I loved Jovovich and (shameless) writer/director Olatunde Osunsanmi at the very end, speaking as themselves, reporting on UFO, alien and FBI ""statistics"" in Nome.It had me in stitches. The trouble is that for nearly 30 years, too many people have already been driven nuts by this alien abduction crap. Like exorcist and paranormal films, this kind of thing needs to STOP. I am begging here! One other thing bothers me: the Zechariah Sitchin factor here. The fact that the aliens are speaking ancient Sumerian ... well, too much Sitchin for my blood. The way the camera caressed 5,000-year-old Sumerian artifacts from some museum was a hoot!And honestly, did you think it was scary? Jeez, people frighten so easily these days I wonder what they'd do if they ever saw what our government really does! One reviewer defies us to watch this alone at night, another says he can't take it too late at night because he'll have nightmares. Sonny boys, I have had worse nightmares from watching crocs eat their dinner along the infested rivers of the world.One interesting stunt I thought was even worse than this film: go online and try to find this Abbey Tyler. Go on - try. You will know the truth, the shameless truth about Hollyweird and its multimedia attempts to hype a film. Let's just say there really is an Abbey Tyler ... on the web.Finally, I must ask: when are viewer disclaimers coming back into vogue? Producers used to be obligated to warn us if they were LYING-for-entertainment-puproses! You know, even Mistress Psychic Cleo had to do that. So why does this film - and the shameless Olatunde Osunsanmi in particular - get to tell the audience that this is all real? Why are the taped sessions presented with onscreen explanations that they are the ""genuine"" tapes? Do they think we are all Sarah Palin??Meanwhile, just watch the original EXORCIST and save a lot of headaches trying to focus on this ruddy hunk of junk.",1,Too many people have been driven nuts by this already,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,3665,"['bit', 'frustrating', 'review', 'film', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'KIND', '2009', 'was', 'captivated', 'whole', 'style', 'thing', 'nerves', 'SAW', 'series', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'attempted', 'genuine', 'footage', 'nearly', 'fooled', 'second', '.Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'psychologist', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'perhaps', 'seeking', 'rash', 'alien', 'abductions', 'real', 'footage', 'cleverly', 'split-screened', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Abbey', 'Tyler', 'played', 'disabled', 'sickly', 'yet', 'ominous', 'Charlotte', 'Milchard', 'British', 'newcomer.We', 'are', 'expected', 'fall', 'premise', 'Nome', 'alien', 'abduction', 'capitol', 'world', 'are', 'also', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Tyler', 'brain', 'who', 'resident', 'alien', 'evil', 'trouble', 'star', 'power', 'here', 'Will', 'Patton', 'big', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'acting', 'lazy', '1st-take-crap', 'call', 'well', 'chicken', 'rest', 'Not', 'tired', 'chicken', 'DEAD.At', 'point', 'film', 'phony', 'genuine', 'footage', 'Tyler', 'being', 'possessed', 'levitated', 'face', 'inhumanly', 'distorted', 'Voice', 'God', 'Father', 'child', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'returned', 'reference', 'Tyler', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'whole', 'thing', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'shivery', 'so', 'close', 'Halloween', 'cheap', 'Halloween', 'thrills', 'close', 'Halloween.It', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'sneak', 'cemetery', 'midnight', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'movie', 'stupid', 'extreme', 'viewer', 'few', 'minutes', 'understand', 'being', 'had', 'minute', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'dumb', 'yet', 'appear', 'be', 'cool', 'ways', 'very', 'advanced', 'loved', 'Jovovich', 'shameless', 'writer/director', 'Olatunde', 'Osunsanmi', 'very', 'end', 'speaking', 'reporting', 'UFO', 'alien', 'FBI', 'statistics', 'Nome.It', 'had', 'stitches', 'trouble', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'driven', 'nuts', 'alien', 'abduction', 'crap', 'exorcist', 'paranormal', 'films', 'kind', 'thing', 'needs', 'STOP', 'am', 'begging', 'here', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'bothers', 'Zechariah', 'Sitchin', 'factor', 'here', 'fact', 'aliens', 'are', 'speaking', 'ancient', 'Sumerian', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'Sitchin', 'blood', 'way', 'camera', 'caressed', '5,000-year-old', 'Sumerian', 'artifacts', 'museum', 'was', 'hoot', 'honestly', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'scary', 'Jeez', 'people', 'frighten', 'so', 'easily', 'days', 'wonder', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'ever', 'saw', 'what', 'government', 'really', 'One', 'reviewer', 'defies', 'watch', 'alone', 'night', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'late', 'night', ""'ll"", 'have', 'nightmares', 'Sonny', 'have', 'had', 'worse', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'crocs', 'eat', 'dinner', 'infested', 'rivers', 'world.One', 'interesting', 'stunt', 'thought', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'film', 'go', 'online', 'try', 'find', 'Abbey', 'Tyler', 'Go', 'try', 'will', 'know', 'truth', 'shameless', 'truth', 'Hollyweird', 'multimedia', 'attempts', 'hype', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'really', 'Abbey', 'Tyler', 'web.Finally', 'must', 'ask', 'when', 'are', 'viewer', 'disclaimers', 'coming', 'back', 'vogue', 'Producers', 'used', 'be', 'obligated', 'warn', 'were', 'LYING-for-entertainment-puproses', 'know', 'even', 'Mistress', 'Psychic', 'Cleo', 'had', 'do', 'So', 'why', 'film', 'shameless', 'Olatunde', 'Osunsanmi', 'particular', 'get', 'tell', 'audience', 'real', 'Why', 'are', 'taped', 'sessions', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'explanations', 'are', 'genuine', 'tapes', 'Do', 'think', 'are', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'Meanwhile', 'just', 'watch', 'original', 'EXORCIST', 'save', 'lot', 'headaches', 'trying', 'focus', 'ruddy', 'hunk', 'junk']",N/A

Milla J. plays Dr. Abigail Taylor as does some celebrated British actress. It was weird, half the movie is in split screen with cam-corder footage of the sposed ""real"" events. Redundant and annoying film style, the 10 million budget split between New Zealand and Buglaria is not likely to help this Director's Carreer, but the movie didn't bomb at the box office, so maybe they will let him do more. I hope he learned from his mistakes. Milla J. was great in the Fifth Element, but hasn't had a decent script since, appearently.I will say that this movie was well researched, in terms of conspiracy lore. David Icke, Jordan Maxwell, and John Lamb Lash have their work at the center of all this, and the story sucked me in. I did my job as a movie watcher, to suspend my disbelief, but the constant insistance that I believe-believe was too much, although they did it with interesting surrealism. Was I supposed to smoke the ganja first?This movie does quite a bit with owls and as a side-note, Israelis and Palestinians share more than just a land claim. They are noted for their owl phobia, so this movie will play well in the middle east should it be screened there, but it didn't work with me, and I was never more proud to be a rational gentile. Owls? Seriously? Why not poodles?

1316515,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B003102IPQ,Fernando,"[6, 9]","Why? Because it's fake. I see a lot of debate here whether this is true or not: it isn't. This is a fake-umentary like the Blair Witch Project, except that in this one the director goes out of his way to hide that fact by letting the viewer ""choose"" whether what they see it's true or not. More on that later.A brief synopsis: in the town of Nome, Alaska several people are reporting similar disturbing experiences, which a psychologist begins to investigate and put together. His wife picks up the trail of the research after he is killed in their bedroom while they sleep. The movie begins with her, Dr. Abigail Tyler, under hypnosis so she could remember who killed him. The story that follows involve her own (taped) meetings with clients, a murder-suicide, the disappearance of her own daughter (which ""remains unsolved"") and how they all relate to UFO abductions.The movie itself works beautifully; it is creepy, scary, disturbing and combines acted with ""real"" footage. The problem is that the ""real"" footage is not real. Sometimes it is not even well acted: while the sympathetic part of me initially respected these distraught people's suffering, the skeptic and trained actor in me finally recognized the at times obvious acting and snake-oil delivery. It was halfway through the movie when I realized the Fourth Kind wanted to pull the proverbial wool over my eyes.A) When people levitate, there is the always convenient blanket or cloth covering the obvious device below that ""levitates"" them.B) The footage, would you believe it, always goes fuzzy at the hypnotism sessions because of the ""energy"" released by the patients. We don't get to see the incredible things that happen at those moments. Darn it!C) The police car footage is always too perfectly located to catch all events.As I watched the decrepit and heartbroken Dr. Tyler, I kept thinking ""she is acting - it's obvious"". True enough, she is NOT the actual doctor (if the doctor even exists). Her name is Charlotte Milchard (google her) and she is a British actress whose IMDB page does not -at the time of this writing- even lists her casting for this movie, although one look at her headshots will suffice to prove she is an actress, not the fabled Dr. Tyler. And this is my problem with the movie: stop claiming something is based on a true story (or in this instance ""actual case studies"") when it isn't. It's like walking into a barn, seeing a pig in a corner with a spider nearby and claiming Charlotte's Web is based on a ""true"" story!Have some people in Nome, Alaska disappeared without a trace? Unfortunately, it seems like they have. Has the FBI investigated these claims? I'm sure they have, as they do with rashes of unsolved mysteries by local authorities. Does that mean aliens abducted them? Hardly.This film is disturbing, creepy enough and not badly made; a perfect movie if you are in the mood with friends. Yet, like Orson Welles' original radio airing of War of the Worlds, it's meant to prey on people's ignorance - except the Fourth Kind has no disclaimers whereas even Welles' worst fiasco did - at the end I found myself disliking the movie more than if it had been honest about itself at the outset. It would have been better if it didn't go out of its way to hide the facts. Then again, with just ""the facts"", the hypothesis of this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on.",2,I Choose NOT to Believe it (Contains Spoilers),1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,3371,"['Why', 'fake', 'see', 'lot', 'debate', 'here', 'true', 'not', ""n't"", 'fake-umentary', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'one', 'director', 'way', 'hide', 'fact', 'letting', 'viewer', 'choose', 'what', 'see', 'true', 'not', 'More', 'later.A', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'town', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'several', 'people', 'are', 'reporting', 'similar', 'disturbing', 'experiences', 'psychologist', 'investigate', 'put', 'together', 'wife', 'up', 'trail', 'research', 'killed', 'bedroom', 'sleep', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'hypnosis', 'could', 'remember', 'who', 'killed', 'story', 'involve', 'own', 'taped', 'meetings', 'clients', 'murder-suicide', 'disappearance', 'own', 'daughter', 'unsolved', 'how', 'relate', 'UFO', 'abductions.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'creepy', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'combines', 'acted', 'real', 'footage', 'problem', 'real', 'footage', 'not', 'real', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'well', 'acted', 'sympathetic', 'part', 'initially', 'respected', 'distraught', 'people', 'suffering', 'skeptic', 'trained', 'actor', 'finally', 'recognized', 'times', 'obvious', 'acting', 'snake-oil', 'delivery', 'was', 'halfway', 'movie', 'when', 'realized', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'wanted', 'pull', 'proverbial', 'wool', 'eyes.A', 'When', 'people', 'levitate', 'always', 'convenient', 'blanket', 'cloth', 'covering', 'obvious', 'device', 'levitates', 'them.B', 'footage', 'would', 'believe', 'always', 'fuzzy', 'hypnotism', 'sessions', 'energy', 'released', 'patients', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'incredible', 'things', 'happen', 'moments', 'Darn', 'C', 'police', 'car', 'footage', 'always', 'too', 'perfectly', 'located', 'catch', 'events.As', 'watched', 'decrepit', 'heartbroken', 'Dr.', 'Tyler', 'kept', 'thinking', 'acting', 'obvious', 'True', 'enough', 'actual', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'even', 'name', 'Charlotte', 'Milchard', 'google', 'British', 'actress', 'IMDB', 'page', 'not', '-at', 'time', 'writing-', 'even', 'casting', 'movie', 'one', 'look', 'headshots', 'will', 'suffice', 'prove', 'actress', 'not', 'fabled', 'Dr.', 'Tyler', 'problem', 'movie', 'stop', 'claiming', 'something', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'instance', 'actual', 'case', 'studies', 'when', ""n't"", 'walking', 'barn', 'seeing', 'pig', 'corner', 'spider', 'nearby', 'claiming', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Have', 'people', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'disappeared', 'trace', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'FBI', 'investigated', 'claims', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'do', 'rashes', 'unsolved', 'mysteries', 'local', 'authorities', 'mean', 'aliens', 'abducted', 'Hardly.This', 'film', 'disturbing', 'creepy', 'enough', 'not', 'badly', 'made', 'perfect', 'movie', 'are', 'mood', 'friends', 'Yet', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'original', 'radio', 'airing', 'War', 'Worlds', 'meant', 'prey', 'people', 'ignorance', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'disclaimers', 'whereas', 'even', 'Welles', 'worst', 'fiasco', 'did', 'end', 'found', 'disliking', 'movie', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'honest', 'outset', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'way', 'hide', 'facts', 'Then', 'again', 'just', 'facts', 'hypothesis', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'leg', 'stand']",N/A

I have to say that it was pretty effective especially if you went and seen this in theaters. If the footage is real or not really has no effect on how one watches this, the fact that it is implied is real puts that thought in your mind for as long as you watch it. Question all you want after and go find out the truth later but during the film it is quite effective in my opinion. In fact the marketing for this film is actually brilliant, I commend the filmmakers for that, the ""Fargo"" of Alien films [get it].The film starts with an introduction from star Milla Jovovich as she goes on to say this is a true story and actual footage and audio will be used in the film. After that we are off as Dr. Abigail Tyler sees patient after patient that are having trouble sleeping and remembering things except for an owl. So she offers a suggestion to each in order to help them out, hypnosis. Things start to go very wrong in the Alaskan town of Nome after she starts this including her own problems haunting her more and more, like the death of her husband.I don't think I am giving anything away by saying this film is about Aliens since the title already tells you that. If you were not aware there are four kinds of encounters with Aliens, this obviously being about the fourth. The four levels were created by UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek and they are as follows here. The first is just a sighting of UFO's and such the second being a sighting but with physical effects, the third is basically contact and of course the fourth being abducted, this was added by a direct associate of Hynek. More levels have been added by other people but the first four are the ones generally accepted by UFO enthusiasts.The film its self is actually pretty good with the added thing of ""this is true"" lingering over it. Then on top of that the fact that they said footage and audio that appears on screen sometimes is real adds to the feel of the flick. Regardless of it being true or not it does add a little something to it. There are some particular moments in this film that are very real feeling and some actual scary ones as well. I would love to talk about one in particular but I would be giving to much away to any one who hasn't seen this.Performance wise I would like to say that I actually liked Milla Jovovich in this and thought she actually fit the role. I have read some things about her in this film that have been negative but I thought she was pretty good here. Will Patton as always was brilliant as the sheriff who does not believe a word of anything she has to say to him. But out of everybody I was most excited to see Elias Koteas in this film since he is one of my favorite actors. As I thought he was great here as Milla's character's own teacher and therapist.It is interesting to note that Nome Alaska really does have a crazy amount of missing people that the FBI did really go and investigate, the findings were alcoholism and the climate in which they live. This film will make you think and think about different things, like is this film really based on true events. Or is the ""real"" footage and audio really real, but mostly it will make you think about what might actually be up in the sky at night. And if there is really something there will it come visit you any time soon.",4,BRILLIANT MARKETING,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,3432,"['FOURTH', 'KINDThis', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'mixing', 'acting', 'so', 'called', 'real', 'footage', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'effective', 'especially', 'went', 'seen', 'theaters', 'footage', 'real', 'not', 'really', 'effect', 'how', 'one', 'fact', 'implied', 'real', 'puts', 'thought', 'mind', 'as', 'long', 'watch', 'Question', 'want', 'go', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'later', 'film', 'quite', 'effective', 'opinion', 'fact', 'marketing', 'film', 'actually', 'brilliant', 'commend', 'filmmakers', 'Fargo', 'Alien', 'films', '[', 'get', ']', '.The', 'film', 'introduction', 'star', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'say', 'true', 'story', 'actual', 'footage', 'audio', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'off', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'patient', 'patient', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'remembering', 'things', 'owl', 'suggestion', 'order', 'help', 'out', 'hypnosis', 'Things', 'start', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'Nome', 'including', 'own', 'problems', 'haunting', 'more', 'more', 'death', 'husband.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'am', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'saying', 'film', 'Aliens', 'title', 'already', 'were', 'not', 'aware', 'are', 'four', 'kinds', 'encounters', 'Aliens', 'obviously', 'being', 'fourth', 'four', 'levels', 'were', 'created', 'UFO', 'researcher', 'J.', 'Allen', 'Hynek', 'are', 'here', 'first', 'just', 'sighting', 'UFO', 'such', 'second', 'being', 'sighting', 'physical', 'effects', 'third', 'basically', 'contact', 'course', 'fourth', 'being', 'abducted', 'was', 'added', 'direct', 'associate', 'Hynek', 'More', 'levels', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'other', 'people', 'first', 'four', 'are', 'ones', 'generally', 'accepted', 'UFO', 'enthusiasts.The', 'film', 'self', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'added', 'thing', 'true', 'lingering', 'Then', 'top', 'fact', 'said', 'footage', 'audio', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'real', 'feel', 'flick', 'Regardless', 'being', 'true', 'not', 'add', 'little', 'something', 'are', 'particular', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'feeling', 'actual', 'scary', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'love', 'talk', 'one', 'particular', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'this.Performance', 'wise', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'actually', 'liked', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'thought', 'actually', 'fit', 'role', 'have', 'read', 'things', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'negative', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'Will', 'Patton', 'always', 'was', 'brilliant', 'sheriff', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'word', 'anything', 'say', 'everybody', 'was', 'most', 'excited', 'see', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'here', 'Milla', 'character', 'own', 'teacher', 'therapist.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'really', 'have', 'crazy', 'amount', 'missing', 'people', 'FBI', 'did', 'really', 'go', 'investigate', 'findings', 'were', 'alcoholism', 'climate', 'live', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'think', 'different', 'things', 'film', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'real', 'footage', 'audio', 'really', 'real', 'mostly', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'up', 'sky', 'night', 'really', 'something', 'there', 'will', 'come', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

The movie opens with actress Milla Jovovich introducing herself and in a trippy spinning forest reveals that this movie will contain real archived footage of events that took place in Nome, Alaska alongside dramatizations of these events in which she will be playing the role of Abbey Tyler. We are informed that there have been a series of unexplained disappearances in Nome and she cautions us that some of the footage is very ""disturbing.""Over the course of the film, we find out that the people of Nome have been having trouble sleeping and visions of an owl. When under hypnosis, they reveal there is no owl and there is something indescribably frightening at their door. After going through hypnosis, these people change as they react to their newfound memories and the public is in more danger than ever and psychologist, Dr. Tyler is being questioned by Sheriff August (alias) played by Will Patton.""Paranormal Activity"" was an amazingly successful film made by Oren Peli on a budget of $11,000 and marketed as ""actual"" footage. What resulted was a vast public who believed (or were willing to believe for two hours) that paranormal events happened to these two people. But one quick trip to IMDB would prove that they are actors and we can judge the movie on its scare value alone. During the movie, I thought it was lame, afterwards though.....I didn't sleep well that night.This movie decided to take the faux documentary/reality format a step further by creating an opening that feels like the old TV show, ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and presenting us with ""actual"" footage that might fool the untrained eye but only for a few minutes. One reason is Abigail Tyler's appearance in the interviews. She is wearing a great deal of pale powder makeup to appear even more sickly in bad lighting and is totally creepy. Real women do not powder their face to that degree and go without any eye makeup or lip color when they are being filmed on camera. You either make yourself look presentable or you don't try anything at all, you don't deliberately make yourself look worse. The saddest betrayal is taking this scary ghost woman who looks like she should be in ""The Ring"" or on ""Shutter Island"" and casting her counterpart as Milla Jovovich complete with a beautifully manicured appearance and fuchsia lipstick, you couldn't get more night and day than that.There's a difference between reality and acting and I was mildly annoyed that the joke was taken this far but tried to be game about it and let myself be entertained for the course of the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film wasn't that great either. The ""thrilling"" moments were very few and far between. Also the film really went overboard with facts and text on the screen and added audio and video that seemed cool at first but started to become a sad plea of ""Really! It's true! Look at all these important facts and references on the screen!"" Every time any type of alien encounter occurred on tape, it was too blurry, obscured and the tape suddenly messed up. Maybe that stuff would potentially happen in an actual situation, but this was so X-Files that I kept waiting for Mulder and Scully to show up. At least they have clever banter.I really wasn't impressed with Jovovich in this film. She excels at action characters, looking hot and being bad-ass at the same time. Being a quiet psychologist was too big of a change and she just never fit this character right. She tried to plain down a bit with bulky sweaters but that lipstick was a dealbreaker. These may seem like small things but it's hard to play in this faux reality when the acting just isn't up to par enough from your lead and the big budget of this film actually takes away from the ""archived footage"" and becomes too distracting.I don't recommend this film unless you are a really big sci-fi alien encounter buff and whether you believe or not, you'd probably have fun with this.

While it's shown a fictional movie, the introduction by the lead actress Milla Jovovich on the character she's playing added realism to the show.In fact, the show tried to use extensive footage from the lead character Dr. Abigail Tyler that were featured from her hypnosis sessions and afew on situations surrounding her that were gotten from the police. The flim's presentation and somber tone gave it a good mix that it's trying to be as realistic and as close to a semi-documentary as possible.A lot of critics dissent whether the events that happen are real. Given the length the director went through to super-impose the raw images and Milla Jovovich reassurance from the start of the flim that it was real, I am not sure how much they are expecting, short of having a personal intimate experience on the subject.On the other hand, the director can never claim for it to be documentary given the ""lack of facts"" related to such a theme (of the fourth kind). Afterall, its not an animal documentary. Thus far, I also haven't read any law-enforcement officers disputing the contents and trips made by the FBI to Nome.

1316529,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B003102IPQ,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 1]","I gotta hand it to the filmmakers of this film, they weren't worried about following any rules of standard movies. In fact, from the start, they break the fourth wall with talking directly to the audience and states that, in the end, it's up to the individuals watching to decide what they will believe. One rule broken is to present any movie that's based on any true story as though it is happening in real life, instead, they do a split- they show the re-enactment alongside a homemade interview tape to show how close the acting is to the reality of it.Storywise, it's pretty much straightforward, if not askewed at first. A psychologist has a hypnotism done on her to figure out what she can't remember about her husband dying. Finding out that there's a small town where people are having strange encounters that can't be explained, she travels, with her blind daughter and cynical son, to said town to perform hypnotisms to see what each person can recall. What they recall is very eerie, completely surreal. And, at times, very frightening. And what really gets her is the common threads through each story. Things get from askewed to plain-out bizarre after one patient gets so paranoid, that a tragedy happens. And from there, everything spirals out of control. Videos shown from the videos that recorded them show very strange things happening (that is, if you can see them happening beyond the EM-induced distortions). Probably the part that really got me was a possession lifting a man out of his bed and speaking in an ancient language. Usually, in possession films, a possessed person speaks Latin or Hebraic. In this case, it's one of the oldest languages in written history- Sumerian, which made this even stranger. And the ending confrontation with a hypnotism-induced possession was, by far, among the creepiest, spine-chilling moments I've ever seen in such a movie, and the first ever in a pseudo-sci-fi/mockumentary film. No matter what you believe- that UFOs are a joke of a hoax, that they're real and out there, that they're demons with technology, whatever else- this has the possibility to get people to think about the possibility of things beyond the realm of the normal.

1316531,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B003102IPQ,J from NY,"[6, 6]","Director Olatunde Osunsanmi drops the ball occasionally with this film, there's no denying that--having Milla Jovovich (Dr. Abbey Tyler) approach the camera at the beginning, looking every inch a Hollywood actress, telling us that ""what we are about to see are interviews with abductees"" and the rest of it.  He did not handle the premise nearly as well as the makers of ""Paranormal Activity"", ""The Blair Witch"", etc, and I suspect that otherwise this would be in the top ranks of a lot of the horror films made today.If one can overlook that mole, this is a startling and at times really scary film which approaches ""alien abduction"" from a different vantage point: if an alien entity did indeed exist it would not necessarily be a benevolent force in the universe.  Indeed, it may be the exact opposite: a malign and vicious phenomena which destroys the human psyche at random and reduces human beings to mere husks of what they were.  It provides some real chills to see (Charlotte Milchard)  the 'Real' Dr. Abbey Tyler  being interviewed about her experiences, looking like a half alien and half annorexic who has had the life quite literally scared out of her.The film's basic premise is the destruction of a small town, and Jovovich plays a shrink who is unfortunate enough to have most of her patients end up getting into contact with some kind of alien intelligence.  ""The White Owl"" is a Lovecraftian image used regularly throughout the movie--all the abductees report witnessing an appalling, disgusting image of a white owl outside their windows.  One commits suicide and takes his family with him, leading the town sherrif (Will Patton hamming it up again) to believe that Tyler is somehow responsible for these events.  The mood of psychological disturbance is amped up to the max when she begins to videotape these interviews and the patients are sometimes literally ""torn apart"" by their psychic distress.  The ""archival footage"" is what makes this film.  I don't think there's much ambiguity here: Tyler was not crazy and whether her husband really did commit suicide or not, he was in all likelihood a victim of the same presence.

1316532,ANWI82QD4I7TY,B003102IPQ,J. Jonathan Nichols,"[0, 2]","This alien abduction film made me glad that I am a scholar of rhetoric.  Jovovich appears at the onset sans character, informing the viewer that what follows is ""based on true events,"" but the names and the professions of those involved have been changed to protect their identity.  Then in true Blair Witch style, allegedly ""true"" video recordings of psychoanalysis sessions as well as police dashboard cameras are interwoven into the film to add to the documentary-style feel.  So the logical question becomes, ""why change the names if you're going to show their faces?""  Don't care if I'm a spoiler, but ain't none of it real, folks.  Through a bit of ""rhetrickory,"" the film can accurately be labeled as ""based on true events.""  There are people who have indeed claimed to have been abducted by aliens and portions of the film play out according to these reports.But the cases portrayed in The Fourth Kind never happened.  Period.  If it had, I guarantee that everyone would know about it by now because abduction researchers would finally have the hard evidence they've been so sorely lacking for so many years.  Don't you believe it.  Sensationalized, manipulative, and bereft of ability.  It is inaccurate as documentary and ineffective as thriller.  While I am not yet convinced of the phenomenon of alien abduction, please don't anyone base their decision on the reality of the reports based on this movie.On the plus side, it was a nice touch to have the aliens speaking Sumerian.  Ancient Astronaut theorists (which I am not, not really, anyway) have long held that humanity's first recorded contact with extraterrestrials was in Sumeria.

The footage may be fake, and I would suspect it to be so because you never know what the horror industry will do to make things more dramatic; and believing what is happening is real is frightening, so who knows! As a researcher on these types of things I will say that a lot of what is found in this movie is true. Yes, the Sumerians do talk about flying vehicles as well as suited space men that visited Earth. Yes, the Sumerians did have a word for rocket; shem. Yes, there are millions of people who see ufo's all over the world. Yes, there are very well documented cases that, with what is called hypnotic regression (using hypnosis to go back in time to an event in this or another life time), have startling stories of people being abducted by aliens and having no one believe them. Take the case of Barney and Betty Hill. They were abducted in the 60's. They went through regression and told parallel stories, yet their doctor said they were hallucinating. He couldn't handle this type of information of beings coming down and messing with humans.As far as the Sumerian language is concerned in 1987 we did have a great knowledge of the Sumerian language. Zecharia Sitchin, the founder of the now popular Anunnaki theory of the Sumerians, has been running through tablet after tablet for years. If he got hold of the tapes he could have helped these people out, so I think perhaps these tapes were edited. But really, who knows?I am taking a middle ground here. These events do go on; aliens taking humans up. Yes these pieces of footage look ""too good to be true."" So what will I say about this case? I would not use it due to the many speculations against it due to the fishyness of hollywood. I will not think of this case as either proof OF or AGAINST the theory of extraterrestrials but I will admit...what are the likely hoods of this NOT happening to the human race? I think they are much slimmer than the likely hood of it actually happening (for many reasons I take this position).If you want more on REAL alien abduction stories much like you saw in this film...abductions that have been well documented and handles and proven, for the most part, true...get the following books.Abduction: John MackMissing Time: Budd HopkinsSight Unseen: Budd HopkinsIntruders: Budd HopkinsThis movie, true or not, is one hellova ride with a shocking ending by the main character.5/5John McAdam:Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?Am I Mad Or Coherent?",5,Baie Lekker,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,2480,"['Damn', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'footage', 'may', 'be', 'fake', 'would', 'suspect', 'be', 'so', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'horror', 'industry', 'will', 'do', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'dramatic', 'believing', 'what', 'happening', 'real', 'frightening', 'who', 'researcher', 'types', 'things', 'will', 'say', 'lot', 'what', 'found', 'movie', 'true', 'Yes', 'Sumerians', 'do', 'talk', 'flying', 'vehicles', 'as', 'well', 'suited', 'space', 'men', 'visited', 'Earth', 'Yes', 'Sumerians', 'did', 'have', 'word', 'rocket', 'shem', 'Yes', 'are', 'millions', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'ufo', 'world', 'Yes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'documented', 'cases', 'what', 'called', 'hypnotic', 'regression', 'using', 'hypnosis', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'event', 'life', 'time', 'have', 'startling', 'stories', 'people', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'having', 'one', 'believe', 'Take', 'case', 'Barney', 'Betty', 'Hill', 'were', 'abducted', '60', 'went', 'regression', 'told', 'parallel', 'stories', 'doctor', 'said', 'were', 'hallucinating', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'type', 'information', 'beings', 'coming', 'down', 'messing', 'humans.As', 'far', 'Sumerian', 'language', 'concerned', '1987', 'did', 'have', 'great', 'knowledge', 'Sumerian', 'language', 'Zecharia', 'Sitchin', 'founder', 'now', 'popular', 'Anunnaki', 'theory', 'Sumerians', 'been', 'running', 'tablet', 'tablet', 'years', 'got', 'hold', 'tapes', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'people', 'out', 'so', 'think', 'perhaps', 'tapes', 'were', 'edited', 'really', 'who', 'am', 'taking', 'middle', 'ground', 'here', 'events', 'do', 'go', 'aliens', 'taking', 'humans', 'up', 'Yes', 'pieces', 'footage', 'look', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'case', 'would', 'not', 'use', 'due', 'many', 'speculations', 'due', 'fishyness', 'hollywood', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'case', 'proof', 'OF', 'AGAINST', 'theory', 'extraterrestrials', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'likely', 'hoods', 'NOT', 'happening', 'human', 'race', 'think', 'are', 'much', 'slimmer', 'likely', 'hood', 'actually', 'happening', 'many', 'reasons', 'take', 'position', '.If', 'want', 'more', 'REAL', 'alien', 'abduction', 'stories', 'much', 'saw', 'film', 'abductions', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'handles', 'proven', 'most', 'part', 'true', 'get', 'following', 'books.Abduction', 'John', 'MackMissing', 'Time', 'Budd', 'HopkinsSight', 'Unseen', 'Budd', 'HopkinsIntruders', 'Budd', 'HopkinsThis', 'movie', 'true', 'not', 'one', 'hellova', 'ride', 'shocking', 'ending', 'main', 'character.5/5John', 'McAdam', 'Were', 'Ancient', 'Gods', 'Other', 'Planets', 'Am', 'Mad', 'Coherent']",N/A
1316534,A3F9VH8916IA40,B003102IPQ,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[10, 24]","Being stationed in Korea, there isn't very much to do, especially if you're under 21. Hell, over here you can't even go off base unless your 21, so yeah, nothing to do but watch movies. Fortunately there is a theater on base, sure it shows movies that have been out forever (Avatar, 2012, etc) but occasionally it shows a movie that I haven't seen, like The Fourth Kind. I remember when I went to see Paranormal Activities that I thought these two films were one and the same. They were marketed in much the same way and their plots seemed eerily similar, plus it didn't help that I hadn't done research on either films. When I realized my mistake I was a little embarrassed but not too much. After all, it allowed me to see PA when I probably would have skipped it, plus it put off seeing this God awful excuse for a film.Set in Nome Alaska, The Fourth Kind is about ""actual case studies"" telling the story of actual people who were abducted by aliens. Yeah right. These people go all out trying to make us believe this nonsense, making spooky X-Files ish monologues with our main characters standing in the middle of a forest at night with a flood light shining behind them telling us about how everything in this film is real, that we can chose to believe it if we want or reject it completely, informing us about how the FBI seems oh SOOO interested in Name. Forget the fact that this is all complete bull, and anyone with an ounce of sense can see through this ""scary"" drivel. I mean really people, did ANYONE fall for this? Anyone? Here's a hint. It is mentioned that the main character, the real one not the ""dramatized""Version, is still trying to convince people her story is true even appearing in an interview retelling it for everyone, and yet they would have us believe that she wants to use an alias instead of her real name. Right. Of COURSE that would be the case and the whole alias thing isn't some cheap trick to keep people from googling the names and finding out the movie is complete BS. THAT couldn't be the reason. I've seen movies ""based on actual events"" that try to make people think their real and do a good job at it (Paranormal Activities, Blare Witch Project) but this is some absurd. What this movie is, is just two films (one made in the same way PA was, one the Hollywood version) spliced together to give the appearance of realism, and its SOOOOO easy to tell. Not that PA or Blare Witch actually made me think those events were real, but good God they didn't go to the absurd lengths this film did to make me believe. This movie just bashes you over the head over and over and over, trying to make you believe this nonsense, but it's not. Give it a rest.Other than that, this film is very gimmicky. I thought the split screens went out of style when the first Hulk movie tanked; I was under the impression that Hollywood realized that was a VERY bad idea. Nobody likes split screens, it's confusing, it gets in the way of the action, and it gives me a headache. Apparently the makers of this movie didn't get the hint. Remember how I said this is really just two movies with two different sets of actors spliced together? Guess how they do it? They play the same exact scene from both versions at the same time by splitting the screen between the two. So, you see a crummy home made version of the scene, and a glamorized Hollywood version, right next to each other, both doing the same exact thing. Apparently, this was done to make it seem more real. Please, don't insult my intelligence. But the problem with the split screens doesn't end there, oh no, it gets better than that. There was one specific scene I remember where not only did we get the two different versions of the movie placed side by side, both of those scenes were split as well leaving four, yes four, screens to follow. What's more these four screens kept changing in size, pulsing as it were, while poor little ol me tried desperately to figure out what the hell as going on. Oh, and the audio kept switching from the ""real"" footage to the Hollywood footage, adding to the confusion.Other gimmicks? Well, as I said before, there's the X-Files ish ""the movie is based on real events"" monologues at the beginning and end of the film, there's also the aliens speaking in a thousand year old dead language claiming that it (whatever it is) is God. Oh, THAT didn't sound gimmicky at all. The alien talking to the screaming woman while she pleads for her child to be returned and then claiming that it is God. Hmm, yeah, and I'm supposed to think that if an alien spoke on tape before and claimed it was god that I wouldn't have heard about it before now? That this wouldn't be the most famous video clip ever? Didn't they say this movie was based on real life? Yeah, I think they did, about a dozen times.I won't say that the movie didn't frighten me on occasion. It did. There were some scares in it, and there were a few things that were well done, but the bad in this film FAR outweighs anything they did right. It had a good concept, there were some scares, and there was also some great imagery (the owls were great I thought) but boy oh boy, was this film gimmicky or what? I won't tell you not to see it, this movie could be like PA, hit or miss depending on the viewers, but I didn't like it, not in the least bit.Replay value, low.",1,"Wow, what a stupid

Like Europa Report (another recent film which did this documovie style) I kept getting dragged out of the story and mood whenever they would splice in an interview with one of the people who the movie is based on or would use voice/ camcorder footage alongside the re-enactment. It only served to remind me that this isn't happening (even though I know they hoped it would have the opposite effect).That aside, I am not a fan of shaky-cam filming in general (especially in movies like this which have mostly calm scenes). The actors playing the main characters did fine in the roles but most of the minor characters were pretty bad (thankfully their roles were small enough as to not distract for too long).I can't really recommend it.

1316536,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B003102IPQ,Jordan David,"[2, 2]","Not to be left behind by the indi/docu buzz boat that set sail this year, Paramount and Columbia already enjoying the tropical breeze atop the deck,  Universal pictures looked to their marketing department to conjure up a makeshift raft that will excuse their lack of punctuality to the box office party.Enter newcomer Olatunde Osunsanmi's science fiction thriller, The Fourth Kind.  I would suspect that, by now, most of us are aware of the ambiguous and relatively clever trailers depicting unsettling bits of raw, fuzzy footage injected into the seemingly more typical scenes that largely boil down to neurotic folks talking about owls.Yes, this film has been marketed heavily and, yes, it's a bit of a disappointment, but only because the glimpses of real brilliance underscore the entire project, to an extent that these fleeting moments elevate the film from mundane shock-fest, to an intriguing and intelligent take on the saturated extraterrestrial subgenre.Similar to Neill Blomkamp's masterful District 9, this movie does take advantage of its mockumentary style more often than not; unfortunately, the results are often mixed, occasionally presented in a fashion that is more tedious and redundant than immersive.  Osunsanmi and his team took very sincere strides to create a truly unique presentation that, at the very least, is respectably clever and, at its best, shockingly unsettling in its pseudo authenticity.  Although I remain skeptical, this is a vision that has been largely realized, and its power will often surprise you.Still, the avant-garde elements need to know when to keep their heads down and let the audience be scared for the sake of the imagery, not from what me may or may not see through a hail of static and white noise.  The exercise of ""the audience fears what it doesn't see"" has been taken to extremes here, but it offers us so little in return that we are often left in hazy frustration at the lack of a payoff.  If Shayamalan had it wrong when he gave us a detailed look at his extraterrestrial, Osunsanmi went to the other end of the spectrum, which is equally as irresponsible.Given the lean amount of substance that the actors had to work with, performances are quite strong.  Milla Jovovich does her best as the leading actress in an uncanny role and, while it may fall short of the height of her career, her portrayal of a woman stripped of everything she loves is solid, if not commendable.  While the rest of the team largely falls to the wayside, Enzo Cilenti and Will Patton stand out as citizens of the small town struggling with the atrocities occurring.  Patton, especially, sinks into his role like butter as a harrowed chief of police, and Cilenti steals what is, arguably, the biggest scare of the movie.Ultimately, the satisfaction arises not from the scattershot scares and performances but, rather, Osunsanmi's ability to take an overdone concept and, just nearly, turn it on its head.  The end result is a feeling that many likely wont have felt for some time:  That the enigmas remain open to debate among skeptics and proponents alike, no matter what may arise from either party.  It's a disturbing notion that will spark debate and stay with you long after you've left the theatre and, by that regard, The Fourth Kind is a modest success.",3,The Fourth Kind,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3303,"['Not', 'be', 'left', 'indi/docu', 'buzz', 'boat', 'set', 'sail', 'year', 'Paramount', 'Columbia', 'already', 'enjoying', 'tropical', 'breeze', 'deck', 'Universal', 'looked', 'marketing', 'department', 'conjure', 'up', 'makeshift', 'raft', 'will', 'excuse', 'lack', 'punctuality', 'box', 'office', 'party.Enter', 'newcomer', 'Olatunde', 'Osunsanmi', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'would', 'suspect', 'now', 'most', 'are', 'aware', 'ambiguous', 'relatively', 'clever', 'trailers', 'depicting', 'unsettling', 'bits', 'raw', 'fuzzy', 'footage', 'injected', 'seemingly', 'more', 'typical', 'scenes', 'largely', 'boil', 'down', 'neurotic', 'folks', 'talking', 'owls.Yes', 'film', 'been', 'marketed', 'heavily', 'yes', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'only', 'glimpses', 'real', 'brilliance', 'entire', 'project', 'extent', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'elevate', 'film', 'mundane', 'shock-fest', 'intriguing', 'intelligent', 'take', 'saturated', 'extraterrestrial', 'subgenre.Similar', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'masterful', 'District', '9', 'movie', 'take', 'advantage', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'results', 'are', 'often', 'mixed', 'occasionally', 'presented', 'fashion', 'more', 'tedious', 'redundant', 'immersive', 'Osunsanmi', 'team', 'took', 'very', 'sincere', 'strides', 'create', 'truly', 'unique', 'presentation', 'very', 'least', 'respectably', 'clever', 'best', 'shockingly', 'unsettling', 'pseudo', 'authenticity', 'remain', 'skeptical', 'vision', 'been', 'largely', 'realized', 'power', 'will', 'often', 'surprise', 'you.Still', 'avant-garde', 'elements', 'need', 'know', 'when', 'keep', 'heads', 'down', 'let', 'audience', 'be', 'scared', 'sake', 'imagery', 'not', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'hail', 'static', 'white', 'noise', 'exercise', 'audience', 'what', ""n't"", 'see', 'been', 'taken', 'extremes', 'here', 'so', 'little', 'return', 'are', 'often', 'left', 'hazy', 'frustration', 'lack', 'payoff', 'Shayamalan', 'had', 'wrong', 'when', 'gave', 'detailed', 'look', 'extraterrestrial', 'Osunsanmi', 'went', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'equally', 'irresponsible.Given', 'lean', 'amount', 'substance', 'actors', 'had', 'work', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'strong', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'best', 'leading', 'actress', 'uncanny', 'role', 'may', 'fall', 'short', 'height', 'career', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'stripped', 'everything', 'solid', 'not', 'commendable', 'rest', 'team', 'largely', 'wayside', 'Enzo', 'Cilenti', 'Will', 'Patton', 'stand', 'out', 'citizens', 'small', 'town', 'struggling', 'atrocities', 'occurring', 'Patton', 'especially', 'sinks', 'role', 'like', 'butter', 'harrowed', 'chief', 'police', 'Cilenti', 'steals', 'what', 'arguably', 'biggest', 'scare', 'movie.Ultimately', 'satisfaction', 'not', 'scattershot', 'scares', 'performances', 'rather', 'Osunsanmi', 'ability', 'take', 'overdone', 'concept', 'just', 'nearly', 'turn', 'head', 'end', 'result', 'feeling', 'many', 'likely', 'wont', 'have', 'felt', 'time', 'enigmas', 'remain', 'open', 'debate', 'skeptics', 'proponents', 'alike', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'arise', 'party', 'disturbing', 'notion', 'will', 'spark', 'debate', 'stay', 'long', ""'ve"", 'left', 'theatre', 'regard', 'Fourth', 'Kind', 'modest', 'success']",N/A

As long as one character is based on a real person, they can claim the whole story is based on truth, even if it's a complete fabrication.  The word for this is ""fiction"" and it's a concept with which many reviewers seem to be unfamiliar.  Everyone's getting hung up on this, but it's the movie's central conceit.  You need to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy it; taking a tip from HP Lovecraft, the filmmakers have fabricated ""real"" documents to bolster the illusion of reality in their story.  They had me fooled for a while, but the real tip-off was (SPOILER) the police footage of the murder-suicide by the first hypnosis patient.  No police department in the Western world would ever release video footage of people being killed, and no responsible studio would use such footage in a major release.  It had to have been staged; if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD you will see that it obviously WAS staged.  This calls all the other ""archival"" footage into question.  If you're still uncertain, then the big reversal at the end should tip off the average-intelligence viewer that they've been watching a hoax.But what a hoax!  Condemning this movie for ""lying"" to you is to miss the point.  It's not a documentary; it's a psychological horror film.  One of the most effective ones I've seen in years.The movie is well edited, beautifully shot .. the story is well constructed .. even though it plays on all the old alien-abduction cliche's, it seems to manipulate the archetypes effectively.  The abduction experience is something that actually happens to people.  What's uncertain is whether these are objectively ""real"" or intense hallucinations.  Whatever causes them, there is no doubt that people all over the world DO have these experiences, and that fact scares the heck out of me.  Though I groaned at the ridiculous ""aliens speaking ancient Sumerian"" bit (just too much to swallow, I'm sorry) the shots of the owls gave me genuine chills .. and most of the time this movie actually unsettled me.

1316546,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B003102IPQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","At the beginning of ""The Fourth Kind,"" actress Milla Jovovich addresses the came and tells us that she is the actress Milla Jovovich and that she will be playing a real person, psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler.  That is because the events in this film supposedly all happened in Nome, Alaska.  As anybody who has seen ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" might guess from the title, this 2009 film has something to do with aliens; UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek's original three classifications have been expanded by others to seven, of which the fourth is alien abduction.  It seems that while there are video recordings of many of Dr. Tyler's, instead of making a documentary, writer-director Olatunde Osunsanmi, has combined the ""real"" footage with the recreations by Jovovich and the other actors.  Throughout the film we not only switch back and forth between the ""real"" and the ""dramatizations,"" but often we will see both on screen at the same time.  Additionally, there is a lot of reading to do in this film, because a lot of what is being ""said"" is unintelligible otherwise and there are also these annoying reminders that Will Patton is an actor.Every since I started reading the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, such as ""A Princess of Mars,"" which often begin with a declaration that there story is true or the author found the manuscript, I have been aware that just because something says it is true, it is not necessarily true.  That applies to not only things like ""The Amityville Horror"" or ""Fargo,"" but also you standard biopics or any depictions of historical (a.k.a. ""real"") events.  I do not believe politicians or people selling products on television, but I am going to treat anything I see in a movie as ""what really happened""?  Not going to happen.  But every since ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which successfully suckered a heck of a lot of people (including my oldest daughter) into believing it was real after seeing the ""documentary"" on television, filmmakers have been trying to make lightning strike twice.  The closest a film has come to succeeding in that regard has been ""Paranormal Activity,"" and that is not because I ever entertained any belief that the story was true, but rather because it had the same sort of simplicity that made ""Blair Witch"" work.  In contrast to either of those films, ""The Fourth Kind"" is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to keeping things simple.The fault for this film's failure lies more in the motive for the elaborate insistence that this is a ""true"" story, which Osunsanmi felt was necessary to construct because basically a lot of his key scenes are patients, under hypnosis, talking to a psychiatrist.  This is not a situation that makes for thrilling filmmaking, and usually involves flashbacks (e.g., ""Suddenly, Last Summer"") or the recreation of dream imagery (e.g., ""Spellbound,"" where Hitchcock used Salvadore Dali to come up with the imagery).  I think that is the reason for complicating things with the wall of competing images.  So it is not surprising that the parts of the movie that I thought were most effective were far removed from that nonsense, namely when Sheriff August (Patton) interrogates Abby about what the hell has been happening and confronts her with some pretty brutal realities.  I have always liked Patton's quiet intensity and Jovovich's scenes with him are the best I have seen her do in a movie, which is while I end up rounding up on this movie.

Staying within the theme of lies, it is not a stretch, therefore, to jump to a review of ""The Fourth Kind.""We watched this movie last night, hoping for some of the atmosphere and fright typical of a ""Fringe,"" X Files,"" or ""Twin Peaks"" type of experience. The premise that Nome, Alaska, has become a special zone for alien abductions and how those abductions affect the victims and those around them is a solid idea. Pitting those with insights into what appears to have happened with the forces of rationality and authority makes for a tried and true archetypal conflict. Creating a gestalt that ""what you are seeing is real but the names have been changed"" is another standard artifice now in vogue among moviemakers.The sets were good, though Bulgaria as a stand-in for Nome seemed a bit perhaps gentrified at times. Borrowing the notion that ""the owls are not what they seem to be"" from Twin Peaks was a good use of a conceit that certainly has merit.The problems are not with the premise, but rather the execution. Cluttering the screen with ceaseless, annoying reminders that we are seeing or hearing actual footage or sound, offering split-screen takes on the same seen, and using a more or less disembodied head of the lead actor to induce us to suspend or redirect belief in the opening scenes all became contrived annoyances. The pacing of the scenes and dialogue all seemed forced and rushed to the point that all the oxygen and spontaneity were sucked from the film.

One of the things that immediately struck me in the film was the recurring imagery of a Barn Owl  by Dr. Tyler and her patients.Those who do not understand why owls are ideally suited to a surveillance role, overlook this or use it as a point of mockery for their disbelieving and insensitive posts.  This is really a shame because, because assuming one has the power to control animals, an Owl would be your number one choice for nighttime human habitat surveillance.Like eagles, owls are raptors, descendants of predatory dinosaurs. What is interesting about owls is how nature has coordinated their hearing and vision.  As to their sense of smell, it is rather poor. It is why the Great Horned Owl (which is also a native species in Alaska) is the number one predator of skunks.  The Barn Owl in this film is so effective in controlling rodent populations that many farmers prefer them to poisons and traps.The eyes of an owl are powerful.  So powerful, were humans to have similar capabilities, our eyes would be the size of small oranges.  The feathered cups around the owls eyes are there for a purpose many do not understand.  If we compare them to the satellite dishes we use for cable TV, the owl's early capture line of sight sounds and then direct those sounds to its ears.An owl's ears are asymmetrical. In other words, one is always a little higher than the other. The reason for this, is that it enables the owl to compare differences between the two ears so as to determine the distance to the target. In a manner of speaking this is much like how submarines use sonar, to determine direction and distance to target.Consequently, when an owl is looking in a specific direction, they see with incredible acuity the line of sight sounds from the target are calculated thanks to the owl's asymmetrical ears. Consequently, the owl see and hears the target with perfect clarity and likewise knows the precise distance and movement of the target as well.Assuming, you are and extraterrestrial and you want to know where your targets are in a human habitat, you send an owl.  Once the owl hear detects a sound from inside the structure it focuses its eyes in the direction.  At that point, you'll know exactly who or what is in that structure, as well as their precise location.  You'll likewise know if they are moving or resting.  Or in other words, an owl is the perfect surveillance tool for an abduction.I believe that this woman and her patients had genuine and terribly unfortunate experiences.  Emotional pain like that goes beyond the antics of theater.  However, what is most unfortunate, is the arrogant mockery these experiencers must endure from those who simply will not open their minds, but rather, humiliate others to protect their own fears.",5,Why Owls Is The Perfect Surveillance Tool For An Abduction,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2863,"['Fourth', 'Kind', 'documents', 'encounters', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'patients', 'One', 'things', 'immediately', 'struck', 'film', 'was', 'recurring', 'imagery', 'Barn', 'Owl', 'Dr.', 'Tyler', 'patients.Those', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'owls', 'are', 'ideally', 'suited', 'surveillance', 'role', 'overlook', 'use', 'point', 'mockery', 'disbelieving', 'insensitive', 'posts', 'really', 'shame', 'assuming', 'one', 'power', 'control', 'animals', 'Owl', 'would', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'choice', 'nighttime', 'human', 'habitat', 'surveillance.Like', 'eagles', 'are', 'raptors', 'descendants', 'predatory', 'dinosaurs', 'What', 'interesting', 'owls', 'how', 'nature', 'coordinated', 'hearing', 'vision', 'sense', 'smell', 'rather', 'poor', 'why', 'Great', 'Horned', 'Owl', 'also', 'native', 'species', 'Alaska', 'number', 'one', 'predator', 'skunks', 'Barn', 'Owl', 'film', 'so', 'effective', 'controlling', 'rodent', 'populations', 'many', 'farmers', 'prefer', 'poisons', 'traps.The', 'eyes', 'owl', 'are', 'powerful', 'So', 'powerful', 'were', 'humans', 'have', 'similar', 'capabilities', 'eyes', 'would', 'be', 'size', 'small', 'oranges', 'feathered', 'cups', 'owls', 'eyes', 'are', 'there', 'purpose', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'compare', 'satellite', 'use', 'cable', 'TV', 'owl', 'early', 'capture', 'line', 'sight', 'sounds', 'then', 'direct', 'sounds', 'ears.An', 'owl', 'ears', 'are', 'asymmetrical', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'always', 'little', 'higher', 'other', 'reason', 'owl', 'compare', 'differences', 'two', 'ears', 'so', 'determine', 'distance', 'target', 'manner', 'speaking', 'much', 'how', 'submarines', 'use', 'sonar', 'determine', 'direction', 'distance', 'target.Consequently', 'when', 'owl', 'looking', 'specific', 'direction', 'see', 'incredible', 'acuity', 'line', 'sight', 'sounds', 'target', 'are', 'calculated', 'thanks', 'owl', 'asymmetrical', 'ears', 'Consequently', 'owl', 'see', 'target', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'likewise', 'precise', 'distance', 'movement', 'target', 'well.Assuming', 'are', 'extraterrestrial', 'want', 'know', 'where', 'targets', 'are', 'human', 'habitat', 'send', 'owl', 'owl', 'hear', 'sound', 'structure', 'eyes', 'direction', 'point', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'what', 'structure', 'as', 'well', 'precise', 'location', ""'ll"", 'likewise', 'know', 'are', 'moving', 'resting', 'other', 'words', 'owl', 'perfect', 'surveillance', 'tool', 'abduction.I', 'believe', 'woman', 'patients', 'had', 'genuine', 'terribly', 'unfortunate', 'experiences', 'Emotional', 'pain', 'antics', 'theater', 'However', 'what', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'arrogant', 'mockery', 'experiencers', 'must', 'endure', 'who', 'simply', 'will', 'not', 'open', 'minds', 'rather', 'humiliate', 'others', 'protect', 'own', 'fears']",N/A

The movie really doesn't take any sides it only presents you with evidence.This isn't ""Signs"" so don't expect to go into watching this expecting to see some sort of creature at the end.

1316555,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003102IPQ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","""The Fourth Kind"" is ostensibly about alien abductions, but it's really a mockumentary-style film that tries so hard to convince you it's real that it works.  ""The Fourth Kind"" doesn't need to be authentic, it just needs to sow enough doubt about its veracity to scare you.  And in that regard ""The Fourth Kind"" succeeds in spades.The movie begins with a televised interview from Chapman University with psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler (Charlotte Milchard/Milla Jovovich), retelling her close encounter in Nome, Alaska in October 2000: Tyler's husband Will (Julian Vergov) is murdered in his sleep, leaving behind two children, little Ashley (Mia McKenna-Bruce) and recalcitrant Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Tyler is fond of hypnotherapy (it seems she has no other tools of psychology at her disposal) and soon discovers that under hypnosis every patient sees a white owl staring at them but can remember little else.  But they DO eventually remember, and the dredged up memories so horrify Tyler's patients that one of them (Corey Johnson as Tommy Fisher) goes on a murder-suicide spree.The white owl is no owl of course, and the aliens invoked by the title have a habit of kidnapping people while they're being recorded: on camera, in a Dictaphone, or even under hypnosis. ""The Fourth Kind"" is smart enough not to rely on a SFX budget and instead prefers to let the evidence speak for itself - mostly blurry cameras, inhuman voices, and lots of terrified screaming. Although ""The Fourth Kind"" is supposedly about alien abduction, it has a surprising amount in common with demonic possession films.  That's a compliment - see ""The Astronaut's Wife"" for a similar attempt that goes horribly awry.""The Fourth Kind"" plays a clever shell game with our expectations by casting Milla Jovovich as Charlotte Milchard who is playing Dr. Abigail Tyler.  The film makes much ado about the distinction between the actress playing Tyler and the ""real"" Tyler by showing them on a split screen or overlapping their dialogue. ""The Fourth Kind"" never lets you forget that this is a dramatization of a supposedly real event, and reminds you so much that after a certain point the sheer audacity challenges your skepticism.""The Fourth Kind's"" biggest flaw is its strength: the plot is ludicrous. Sheriff August (Will Patton) relentless skepticism strains credulity, particularly in light of the numerous disappearances of the townsfolk.  Either Tyler is a serial killer who should be locked up or there's really some merit to her abduction theories, but August never settles on a decision other to bully her whenever she's vulnerable. This is one of those films where nobody ever actually speaks in plain English or thinks to spin the tale in a way that might be believable to law enforcement.

In fact, I just recently saw a show on one of the learning channels that talked all about the deadly combination of alcohol, the lack of daylight and the extreme cold of Nome, Alaska. The FBI even stated that the murders and missing people of Nome are attributed to this alone. Not that they would tell us the truth if aliens were really taking us in the middle of the night, but in this case it fits. On top of all this, I don't know if the ""real"" footage shown side by side with the actors was tampered with in any way. I also found it curious that it always went blurry or static when the really strange stuff would happen. If this footage has really been around for 9 years, it would have hit YouTube long ago. There was one bit of convincing footage (from a police officer's camera mounted on the dash of his car) that showed a dark craft of some kind flying over the house the same night the main character's little girl was abducted, or so she says. You can hear in the tape that the cop saw the UFO and says that he can see ""them"" taking the child.The acting is fairly good. Milla Jovovich ditches her action heroine persona and delivers a decent performance, but Will Patton goes way over the top as the town sheriff and he seems out of place. As expected the people in the ""real"" footage are more convincing because they aren't acting for a future audience.This will get a lot of comparisons to Paranormal Activity and the studio is probably wishing they released The Fourth Kind a couple of months before, but anyone interested in UFOs, alien abductions or just want to explore the unknown, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.

The reason this has to be stressed, is because of how the movie is presented.  It's presented as entirely a work of reality based events.  Even the actors talk about how real it is in the movie.  When I first watched this movie, I was under the understandable impression that this movie was based on true events.This movie actually makes me quite angry, and here's why... I believe in aliens, I've seen UFOs with my own eyes.  With time, people have become more open about their own encounters with E.T.'s.  I believe the governments around the world know many things about UFOs and aliens, and refuse to share it with the public on a mass scale because of widespread panic & worry.  This is a TERRIBLE movie for exactly that reason - people who see it believe it's real, and therefore have cause to be scared of aliens.  This gives governments and agencies MORE reason to keep us away from the topic of openly discussing UFOs and aliens with them.  Because thanks to this piece of **** movie, the public is more likely to be afraid.In our quest to make contact with aliens on a mass scale & talk about it openly & freely without so much fear of aliens & what making contact with them could bring - this movie has set the human race back many years.  This movie is a step back for mankind.  This isn't like the movie Independence Day.  That movie didn't inspire fear in people about aliens because we knew it was fake.  It didn't try to fool people into thinking it was real.  The Fourth Kind should never be viewed by anyone.  Knowing the story is fake even takes all the entertainment out of the movie, really... In fact the movie actually being fake just makes it downright stupid & a waste of time. The whole movie runs it's entertainment value on being based on true events, once this is taken away, it's really just a horrible movie.Why would aliens even try to make contact with us on a mass scale if they know movies like this exist, & many unknowing people are scared of aliens because of it?A horrible, horrible movie.

If Universal was coming up with a tricky way to scare the crap out of people through creating the illusion that what happens in this film is real....Well, that's entertainment. But for me this isn't scary. I love aliens. I don't find them scary at all. Not the ones that appear to be the closest to reality, with the guitar pick shaped heads and black eyes. Not sure I would want to be probed in my nether regions, so as long as they kept their perverted little naughty martian hands to themselves I suppose they could pick me up and set me down somewhere else a few days later. Might be kind of fun. Anyway, beside the point. Who cares if this is a clever scheme to scare you? Orson Welles did it in the 50's and he's considered a genious for pulling it off so well. So then what is going to the movies is all about if it isn't about having a great time, suspending belief, and having the crapola scared out of you because you are freightened about if its true or not?

1316597,A2M8CILGD2NNPI,B003102IPQ,"Steven Yates ""free your mind""","[5, 5]","This is one of the creepiest films I've seen in some time. As others have noted, it follows the convention that the producers have filmed a documentary & are fictionalizing it. At the beginning, lead actress Milla Jovovich walks out of a fog with an ""explanation"" of what is to come. Several times the film employs a split-screen device to show equivalent sequences from the supposed documentary. The effect is unnerving.Background: Nome, Alaska has experienced a number of cases of persons gone missing (this appears to be true). Dr. Abigail Tyler (played by Jovovich), a psychologist getting over what she maintains was the murder of her husband, has devoted herself to continuing the project he was working on related to these disappearances. Through a number of interviews and hypnotic regression sequences she stumbles on the truth: aliens are abducting people from Nome; some are returned, some not. The visible manifestation of the aliens is a white owl outside one's bedroom window that stares in at you, unmoving, unafraid of you, sometimes remaining in one place for hours.Dr. Tyler's hypnotic regressions get out of control as her subjects relive their harrowing experiences, sometimes severely injured as *something* seems to possess them. One of her subjects murders his family and then kills himself to escape the horror. Sheriff August (Will Patton) doesn't believe her talk of aliens and thinks something she is doing is causing these breakdowns and injuries. He believes she's delusional, having gone over the edge following what happened to her husband (turns out he wasn't murdered but committed suicide in front of her). But the aliens have turned their attention to Dr. Tyler herself. They ""take"" her daughter Ashley, already traumatized from losing her father...A number of others writers have panned this movie. I thought its main devices worked remarkably well; I found myself wanting to hit the pause button and go into my office to ""google"" Abigail Tyler to find out if this was a real documentary. One of the purposes of sci-fi / horror is to get you, the viewer, to suspend your disbelief at least for the duration. This film does that. It is effective enough to have generated online discussions explaining how it worked, and that the ""documentary"" is part of an elaborate fictional device, and that the ""real"" Dr. Tyler was a different actress named Charlotte Milchard.Overall, I found The Fourth Kind to be inferior to Fire in the Sky which has the weirdest and most disturbing sequence I ever saw in a UFO movie. There are a few faux pas IMHO. The film's events are set in October 2000, it says; yet the Nome of this film is awfully lush for that late in the year. Nome, Alaska has a hostile, Arctic climate; and I've never had the impression the surrounding area is as mountainous as it is portrayed here. (I've not been there; others can inform me if this is wrong; I won't mind.) Moreover, apparently the creators of the film went a bit overboard using made-up obits and invented news items that prompted legal action from the Alaska Press Club.Be all this as it may, the film raises some interesting questions. What *did* happen to those people who vanished (ten just since 1990, according to Wikipedia)? While there is nothing to suggest the involvement of aliens, if they simply wandered off drunk and froze to death in the below-zero weather, their bodies would have been found eventually. As for UFOs and abductions: thousands of reliable witnesses have seen things in the sky no one can explain including trained observers: airline pilots, police officers, even astronauts. There are a handful of well documented cases of ""missing time,"" as the literature calls gaps in people's memories ranging from hours to days. The above-mentioned Fire in the Sky dramatizes one such case. What happened? A Christian friend of mine says that UFOs and alien manifestations are the work of demonic forces, not alien intelligences. Whatever they may be, apparently they have been around for quite a while. Members of our culture with its fascination with technology and space travel see spaceships and aliens. Back in the 1800s it was airships. Centuries ago, people saw burning chariots in the sky. You can find them in the Old Testament (see Jeremiah 1). I didn't yet mention: the Fourth Kind beings, whatever they are supposed to be, spoke Sumerian and surely sounded demonic. The voices supposedly recorded by Dr. Tyler on tape make this not a film to watch before you go to bed at night! At least not before checking outside your bedroom window for unmoving white owls with large, staring eyes!Maybe we don't want to know what's really up there. Maybe we just think we do.",4,"""The owls are not what they seem ...

PLEASE MAKE MORE - AND THE MORE SINISTER , THE BETTER.Man - made and 'alien made'UFO's have existed since time immorial.But this film may not exist for time immorial , however. It will thrieve in our memories as one of the funnest to make films of 2009 , when people went into imaginary journeys to imaginary places to tell other people that they had had imaginary experiences , which would later be turned into advanced , highly skillful and creative film projects.The Fourth Kind was really never about anybody or anything 'else'than the storyline and the characters OF THE FILM ITSELF.That is what most people felt it so hard to believe. There is another , very little known film out there that is titled The Beings. I suggest amazon.com find somebody who can make it selleable here , because it's a very well done sci - fi film and can be compared to the Fourth Kind in many ways.It is indeed true that the film models it's storyline after the content of alien abduction accounts , and there is nothing wrong with that.The way I see it there was nothing wrong in the overall production or introduction of the movie. I have also read theories about that it was part of the ploy to stage a fake alien invasion in 2012 , which I think is very probably going to be cancelled now that we know all about it.The aliens in the Fourth Kind are based on the classic gray archetype of alien , and the whole mockumentary cooperates much better with me as a film in my view than Paranormal Activity did , and also because the settings are so completely different. The Fourth Kind cannot be considered as sucessful or sinister as the Wicksboro Incident , and we need more movies like that , and maybe some of them could be over 2 or 3 hours long.I am glad that we know now finally after all these years. What saddens me however , is the extremes and the length to how people can go in order to marketize products such as this. They could have spared the efforts to make the film more convincing than it really is , and realize that there will always be a hardcore of fans of this type of film , and they will not care much if the producer states it's based on actual events or not. If the music works , if the script works , if the play works , that's what counts. If the project is based on actual events , that is always talked about after the film has been viewed. I never bought into most of the stories that the Fourth Kind material presented , and I loved how the film does not demand that you believe in anything that takes place within it's content. If you want to create a seriously sinister UFO abduction movie you have to put yourself into the shoes of the antagonists and the 'bad guys'of the film and not focus on the good guys solely. You also have to make sure the music works just like they did in this film - and then , everything comes out perfect! You've got a film that works and THAT'S WHAT COUNTS , not whether it's factual or not.Too bad the 20000 USD had to be wasted into an effort which could have costed far , far less!!If the directors or producers choose to wait for maybe a few months they could produce another similar film and also  use guerilla marketing , and make far more people die in it and have seriously sinister scenes that won't rely that much on very expensive special effect. Now that we have seen the making of mockumentaries about crazy ghosts , dumbass aliens and moody demons that go bump in the night , it's about time that somebody did a mockumentary about werewolves (there are some about zombies now that I know of but I had forgotten to mention them). THAT would be REALLY fun to watch , especially on a place like [...] or [...]. Way to go! Brilliant piece of work!

I believe this movie was a very clever rouse by the filmmakers, in the vain of  Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, Exorcism of Emily Rose, Fire in the Sky, The Mothman Prophecies making something that is said to be based on true events be not true at all or taking slightly the most sliver of truths and building a fictitious story around it, seen it done hundreds of times in books and movies. We do get Milla Jovovich in the beginning of the film stating that what we are about to see are reenactments of events mixed with ""real"" archival footage of interviews/ hypnosis sessions/  of real people all experiencing some kind of UFO phenomena happening around Nome Alaska in Fall of 2000. Milla Jovovich portrays the Dr in the reenactments then through out we get interview snip- its of the real Dr. Tyler. A part of me wanted to believe this was real, but I would think if a noted Dr of Abigail Tyler's profession would have made this case go nationwide, and that Discovery or History Channel or Larry King would have aired some kind of special about UFO abductions and in particular about strange occurrences in and around Nome Alaska. And this definitely could have been an X Files episode, makes me wonder if the director's inspiration came from the X Files. And The supposedly real interviews and hypnosis sessions through out the movie do seem real and genuinely frightening/ disturbing.... and I don't want to forget the owls...  never have owls seemed so other worldly spooky, and ghost like, some scenes the eyes seem to be piercing into your soul when it looks at you, in the movie there is a correlation with the owls and the conjectured other worldly Visitors, and the ""real"" Dr. Abigail Tyler looks ghostly, sickly, kinda creepy when she first shows up on the screen, we see her being interviewed by the director of this film to give it that realness. Some notable supporting roles: Will Patton, always a favorite of mine turns in a nice performance of the sheriff who doesn't believe in all this UFO mumbo jumbo crap, Elias Koteas as another Dr. friend of Dr. Tyler, gives a good steady performance as well, and Milla of course is great,a different role for her, more dramatic role, shows she's branching off.I give credit to the over all tone of the movie and mood, and style, way it was filmed, mixing supposedly real footage and the reenactments with the actors, very good plot device. I just have to wonder how would said filmmakers get to clear all the red tape if in fact they were real footage of everything that Dr. Tyler did? But kudos to the filmmaker (Olatunde Osunsanmi)for giving us a genuinely frightening, astounding psychological thriller been awhile since I've had my nerves jangled like that.

Sometimes our society is unable to maintain their collective attention span unless they are spoon-fed action on a constant basis.  THE FOURTH KIND has plenty of action but the build up to the climax is slow and anxiety driven.  The acting is first rate and evokes a creepiness that most films can not even come close to.  Whether or not one is nave enough to believe that the film is based on facts is irrelevant to the performance.  This is spine tingling terror at its best.  Some critics have said that the revelation that the events were not true was a ""crushing disappointment.""  I, for one, am VERY glad that the events are likely fictional.  I would not want this sort of thing to be true.  Here is a list of things of note:***Minor Spoilers**** The use of an owl is brilliant....absolutely brilliant.* The aliens almost seem demonic, and that is odd twist.* Your mind is needed to complete the film...rare these days.* The use of ancient language is very interesting.* The camera work is fantastic.* The way the film is put together is a piece of art.In short, THE FOURTH KIND is one of the most disturbing films I have seen in many years.

It leaves a lot open to the viewer, too, and sometimes that is good. Sometimes it is bad, too, and it also ruins a few of the moive's scenes. A lot of the movie is films in split screen or has real audio playing before or after it is acted out. Sometimes this kills the creativity that is being displayed and sometimes it shows you just how much goes into the interpration of actors. One scene out of everything stuck with me here, however, and it was one with a patient taking a family hostage. In one area you see the family and, in another, you see the people acting it out. Then you see both as the family and the father - the hostage taker - turn his gun on everyone and kill them all.It was horrid and yet it said something on the reality of what was going on.The one thing that everyone had in common was seeing an Owl that ""was not an owl,"" but that was thought to be a sign of abduction. There were quite a few oddities here, too, like the things on some of the tapes and some of the possibilities for languages. Still, some of it was not really scientific. The art of recalling memory,for example, is not really a scientific fact. If anything, it was fancy at the time and showing the tapes of it shows how many gaps are there. Sure, people want to believe and, sure, they make tapes that seem strange. The problem is that there is a level of expectation and, much like a parent seeing their child show off to them, this happens here as well.I say this because I thought some of the showing hurt the movie. In the end you think what you want and you see that something possibly happened to these people. Is it a good thing - no. Is it a proven thing - no. The tapes brought in to suggest it was hurt the movie sometimes and, in some cases, make a case for something other than the suggestion of aliens.It is creepy here and there, too, but I would have rather had my stars lghting up the sky and not a shellschocked doctor and her peers/patients/whomever making things slide progressively downhill.That took this to about a 3.6, but rounding it to a 4 makes it seem right because some of it is captivating enough to see more than once.",4,A broken smile never lies,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2237,"['movie', 'one', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'things', 'happened', 'Alaska', 'lot', 'open', 'viewer', 'too', 'sometimes', 'good', 'Sometimes', 'bad', 'too', 'also', 'few', 'moive', 'scenes', 'lot', 'movie', 'films', 'split', 'screen', 'real', 'audio', 'playing', 'acted', 'out', 'Sometimes', 'creativity', 'being', 'displayed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'interpration', 'actors', 'One', 'scene', 'everything', 'stuck', 'here', 'however', 'was', 'one', 'patient', 'taking', 'family', 'hostage', 'one', 'area', 'see', 'family', 'see', 'people', 'acting', 'out', 'Then', 'see', 'family', 'father', 'hostage', 'taker', 'turn', 'gun', 'everyone', 'kill', 'all.It', 'was', 'horrid', 'yet', 'said', 'something', 'reality', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.The', 'one', 'thing', 'everyone', 'had', 'common', 'was', 'seeing', 'Owl', 'was', 'not', 'owl', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'sign', 'abduction', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'oddities', 'here', 'too', 'things', 'tapes', 'possibilities', 'languages', 'Still', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'scientific', 'art', 'recalling', 'memory', 'example', 'not', 'really', 'scientific', 'fact', 'anything', 'was', 'fancy', 'time', 'showing', 'tapes', 'how', 'many', 'gaps', 'are', 'there', 'Sure', 'people', 'want', 'believe', 'sure', 'make', 'tapes', 'seem', 'strange', 'problem', 'level', 'expectation', 'much', 'parent', 'seeing', 'child', 'show', 'off', 'here', 'well.I', 'say', 'thought', 'showing', 'hurt', 'movie', 'end', 'think', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'possibly', 'happened', 'people', 'good', 'thing', 'proven', 'thing', 'tapes', 'brought', 'suggest', 'was', 'hurt', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'cases', 'make', 'case', 'something', 'other', 'suggestion', 'aliens.It', 'creepy', 'here', 'there', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'stars', 'lghting', 'up', 'sky', 'not', 'shellschocked', 'doctor', 'peers/patients/whomever', 'making', 'things', 'slide', 'progressively', 'downhill.That', 'took', '3.6', 'rounding', '4', 'seem', 'right', 'captivating', 'enough', 'see', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Neither place bears any visual similarities to Nome Alaska,not to mention how would everything look that close to the same being filmed 9 years later?My other question is that since everyone in Nome gets abducted by aliens without their memory of it, how come no one has a dog in the house to freak out when the aliens enter the room?

According to the film written and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, while treating her patients, Dr. Abigail Tyler, a psychiatrist living in Nome, discovered horrible truths behind the unexplained missing person cases in the town - that is, sort of ""A Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind.""Milla Jovovich (Alice of the ""Resident Evil"" series) plays the role of Dr. Abigail Tyler. At the beginning of the film Ms Jovovich stands before the camera as herself, an actress, and then she appears as Dr. Abigail Tyler, psychiatrist and mother of two children. Dr. Tyler puts her insomniac patients under hypnosis - all of them say they have seen the same thing, an owl - but the doctor's treatment results in disastrous consequences. There are more details to come in this thin story, which, told in a straightforward way, is in fact nothing but a weak episode in ""The X-Files"" series.Osunsanmi's ""fact-based thriller"" is in a way more ambitious than Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind."" I mean ""The Fourth Kind"" is so intent on being authentic that the film employs several narrative gimmicks such as the use of ""actual audio"" tapes and the ""real"" interview footage (where Osunsanmi himself appears as interviewer). At some points both ""actual footage"" and ""re-enacted footage"" even appear side by side, using the 1960-ish split screen technique.Despite (or because of) the elaborated way in which the film's story is presented, we soon realize that what ""The Fourth Kind"" is trying to do is nothing new, except its pseudo-documentary style, which itself is not enough to keep us interested.

1316623,AZTOAD13FDS58,B003102IPQ,ZenPenguin,"[4, 10]","You need to be a little worried when a movie goes out of its way to assert everything is real - kinda like a sleezeball named ""Rico"" proclaiming he's the best lover in the world to random women at a trash bar.It's hard to pinpoint the worst aspect of this movie. Maybe it's the crappy ""archival footage"" acting, with over-the-top screaming and hokey hypnosis? (one actor in a supposed trance was ""awake"" enough to aim a well-placed, obviously conscious kick to a lamp)  Or the kid who willingly, even eagerly lets an insane cop take him from his mother (illegally) after his dad's been murdered and sister's been abducted by aliens?  Maybe it's the movie's premise; that intellectually-advanced aliens travel trillions of miles to reach Nome, AL, avoiding all detection and contact, just to abduct children and tell us they're God in our sleep.  My personal favorite is the ""doctor"" who translates ancient Sumerian (a language dead for 5000 years that no one has, or ever will, hear spoken) the very first time he hears it on a garbled, $5 tape recorder spoken by an Alien - but somehow misses all the key action verbs and conjunctions.There's so much to criticize about the film that it's better not to play that game.

Milla Jovovich as as Dr. Abigail Tyler was great.  The film is supposed to be based on a true story but there is some question as to weather or not the events  are a hoax. The use Sumerian language and UFOs and most paranormal occurrences are often attended with a strong smell of sulfur. Will Patton is good in this film as well. It was at times scary and disturbing yet a bit tedious as well.See alsoParanormal Activity,3,Is Alaska creepy?,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,552,"['time', 'something', 'paranormal', 'footage', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'get', 'bit', 'blurry', 'Nice', 'footage', 'Alaska', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Dr.', 'Abigail', 'Tyler', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'question', 'weather', 'not', 'events', 'are', 'hoax', 'use', 'Sumerian', 'language', 'UFOs', 'most', 'paranormal', 'occurrences', 'are', 'often', 'attended', 'strong', 'smell', 'sulfur', 'Will', 'Patton', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'times', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'bit', 'tedious', 'well.See', 'alsoParanormal', 'Activity']",N/A
