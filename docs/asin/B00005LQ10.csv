664621,A2YHLBUF1OTDNN,B00005LQ10,A Little ol' gal from &#34;Jaw-Ja&#34;,"[0, 0]","Please remember, that each of the original cast were asked if they wanted to return and finished the story. But a lot of them chose Not to - including Kelly Martin ( Christy ) and Randall Batinkoff ( David).These newer Christy films were taken from Catherine Marshall's last known scribblings and notes she had written down for a sequel to the actual Christy Novel. &#34;The producers drew Christy's ultimate romantic decision from notes for an unfinished sequel Christy novel that were discovered among Catherine Marshall's possessions after her death.&#34;While I too enjoy the original TV Series with Kelly Martin, I like these 3 new Christy movies just as much - if not more! :) I had been hunting down the DVDs of them and finally found them. Sadly with the Kelly Martin version, they did not stay faithful to the book in a lot of ways.I can highly recommend these newer Christy DVDs completely. They are: 1. Christy: Return to Cutter Gap (aka &#34;The Movie&#34;) , 2. Christy: A Change of Seasons and 3.

The television series starring Kellie Martin was superb--but left you with a cliffhanger when the whole series ended!  Who did she marry?  As I remember the filming details of this series, the ending was filmed both ways--and even the cast did not know the ending to the story until the final product was finished!  Would have been interesting if they had provided the alternate ending as ""deleted scenes"" so that everyone could be happy!  Some original actors were brought over from the television series, which gave some sense of continuity--but the main actors (except for Neil) were all different and the setting was different.
