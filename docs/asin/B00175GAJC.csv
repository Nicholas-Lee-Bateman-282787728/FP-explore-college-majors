Jewel is at her best she plays her guitar solo - I don't mind a live band but if you are fan of Pieces of You then you know what I mean. This concert is raw, authentic, and heartfelt. Jewel sings a lot of great songs here: Foolish Games, You Were Meant For Me, Intuition, 1000 Miles Away, Near You Always, Morning Song, Break Me, and Grey Matter. The song that makes me cry like a baby is Violet Eyes - such a gorgeous and gutwrenching ballad. I highly recommend this flawless live concert DVD, Jewel is still a gem!!",5,The Jewel I miss!,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,694,"['Jewel', 'one', 'favorite', 'singer/songwriters', 'inspired', 'buy', 'guitar', '1997', 'recorded', 'beautiful', 'diverse', 'albums', 'watching', 'live', 'real', 'treat', 'Jewel', 'best', 'guitar', 'solo', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'live', 'band', 'are', 'fan', 'Pieces', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'concert', 'raw', 'authentic', 'heartfelt', 'Jewel', 'lot', 'great', 'songs', 'here', 'Foolish', 'Games', 'Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'Intuition', '1000', 'Miles', 'Away', 'Near', 'Always', 'Morning', 'Song', 'Break', 'Me', 'Grey', 'Matter', 'song', 'cry', 'baby', 'Violet', 'Eyes', 'such', 'gorgeous', 'gutwrenching', 'ballad', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flawless', 'live', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Jewel', 'still', 'gem']",N/A

I watched the dvd's and went out and bought the blue ray ( Even Better! ) Disc 2 is the better concert with many excellent songs that have not been recorded. ""Violet Eyes"" was a tear jerker! I can see why she doesn't sing it that often. This concert is different also in the way she explains some of the reasons and life experiences behind the song writing. There is something in this concert for every one.

I also have Live at Humphrys and I like this set more.  It includes a few different songs and is well worth the time spent watching.  I love her voice live- she has so much control over it and it is featured nicely on these discs,5,One of my favorites,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,354,"['Ok', 'am', 'little', 'biased', 'Jewel', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'singer', 'mine', 'BUT', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'well', 'money', 'also', 'have', 'Live', 'Humphrys', 'like', 'set', 'more', 'few', 'different', 'songs', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'love', 'voice', 'live-', 'so', 'much', 'control', 'featured', 'nicely', 'discs']",N/A

Sound Stage puts on great shows and can be counted on for excellent programming as well as stunning sound and first rate visuals. I watched these never knowingly having heard her before...and was blown away.  Jewel has a great voice and is a very accomplished acoustic guitarist. Truly I favor the few artists who are good enough to hold an audience without the need for a powerhouse band and she absolutely fits that bill.  This DVD is a showcase  for her and has made me a fan.

1155790,A35F1AT56OBKLZ,B00175GAJC,T. Evans,"[6, 15]","Jewel probably has one of the top three female singing voices I've heard. She certainly has the most versatile voice I've ever listened to. Her live version of ""Life Uncommon,"" released as a CD single, is one of most uplifting songs I own. I've seen her in concert several times. One was an acoustic show in a university ampitheater. That was five years ago, after her third album, ""This Way,"" was released. I remember seeing more than a few jaws drop during that show. She was hitting unbelievable notes with seeming ease. She also was able to generate remarkable audience buzz for someone doing a solo unplugged show. During the last four or so years, her performances have become uneven, though her talent level clearly has not dropped. Instead, for whatever set of reasons, she doesn't seem as consistently psyched throughout a show as she was earlier in her career. Her performance enthusiasm level seems to rise and lower, and, when it lowers, she appears to lose some of the emotion she needs to draw on to make her great voice sound truly special. She displays this unevenness in this two-DVD performance set. However, when she's great in this set (and these moments seem to be at times of her own choosing), her singing remains truly a gift to enjoy.",3,"Still an ""Uncommon"" performer",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1259,"['Jewel', 'probably', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'female', 'singing', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'certainly', 'most', 'versatile', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'live', 'version', 'Life', 'Uncommon', 'released', 'CD', 'single', 'one', 'most', 'uplifting', 'songs', 'own', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concert', 'several', 'times', 'One', 'was', 'acoustic', 'show', 'university', 'ampitheater', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'third', 'album', 'Way', 'was', 'released', 'remember', 'seeing', 'more', 'few', 'jaws', 'drop', 'show', 'was', 'hitting', 'unbelievable', 'notes', 'seeming', 'ease', 'also', 'was', 'able', 'generate', 'remarkable', 'audience', 'buzz', 'someone', 'doing', 'solo', 'unplugged', 'show', 'last', 'four', 'so', 'years', 'performances', 'have', 'become', 'uneven', 'talent', 'level', 'clearly', 'not', 'dropped', 'Instead', 'set', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'consistently', 'psyched', 'show', 'was', 'earlier', 'career', 'performance', 'enthusiasm', 'level', 'rise', 'lower', 'when', 'lose', 'emotion', 'draw', 'make', 'great', 'voice', 'sound', 'truly', 'special', 'unevenness', 'two-DVD', 'performance', 'set', 'However', 'when', 'great', 'set', 'moments', 'seem', 'be', 'times', 'own', 'choosing', 'singing', 'truly', 'gift', 'enjoy']",N/A
1155791,ARHO1OYMHUVMH,B00175GAJC,Wasting Time,"[1, 1]","Beautifully filmed and fantastic sounding 2 disc set from 2 shows. Not as ""hard-edged"" as her other fantastic live performance on ""Live at Humphrey's by the Bay"" and a bit more ""polished"". Her acoustic performances shine and she rocks with a band backing her up, but doesn't need that to show her talent. I would have preferred she skip the orchestra on the last few songs during the Rialto show and agree not many singers can pull this off. My rating is 4.5 stars taking 0.5 off for the use of that orchestra...not that they aren't very talented, but it just doesn't fit her style well.
