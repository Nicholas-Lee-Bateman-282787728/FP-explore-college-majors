Make no mistake about it:  they are all top-notch violinists, and could all make a go of it in most symphony orchestras.  However, their talent doesn't make the whole Barrage concept any less derivative.Obviously, the producers of Barrage are looking to cash in on the whole ""Riverdance"" craze.  Hey, Riverdance with fiddles!  What's not to like?  Make sure everybody is pretty --- the girls must be well-endowed with pouty lips, and the guys should have that faux-scruffiness that is so en vogue these days.  And there you go.The only problem is, it leaves the whole production with a forced, pre-fabricated quality, as though everything was run past a focus group before it made it into the final program.  Everything seems so calculated for effect, and one cannot help but feel that one has seen this all before.  The spontaneity so necessary in the creative process just seems not to be present.  It isn't terrible --- it's just sort of blah...",3,It feels uninspired & contrived more than anything else,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,1043,"['not', 'knock', 'talents', 'violinists/fiddlers', 'make', 'up', 'group', 'Barrage', 'Make', 'mistake', 'are', 'top-notch', 'violinists', 'could', 'make', 'go', 'most', 'symphony', 'orchestras', 'However', 'talent', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'Barrage', 'concept', 'less', 'derivative.Obviously', 'producers', 'Barrage', 'are', 'looking', 'cash', 'whole', 'Riverdance', 'craze', 'Hey', 'Riverdance', 'fiddles', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Make', 'sure', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'girls', 'must', 'be', 'well-endowed', 'pouty', 'lips', 'guys', 'should', 'have', 'faux-scruffiness', 'so', 'en', 'vogue', 'days', 'go.The', 'only', 'problem', 'whole', 'production', 'forced', 'pre-fabricated', 'quality', 'everything', 'was', 'run', 'focus', 'group', 'made', 'final', 'program', 'Everything', 'so', 'calculated', 'effect', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'one', 'seen', 'before', 'spontaneity', 'so', 'necessary', 'creative', 'process', 'just', 'not', 'be', 'present', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', 'sort', 'blah']",N/A

Made up of eight Canadian violinists/dancers/vocalists and additional musicians on percussion and bass, Barrage is brimming with youthful energy. Their music is a blend of Celtic, folk, Eastern, and big band swing, and the eight performers also sing and dance while fiddling.  A blend of Riverdance and Stomp, the concert is interspersed with comments by the various performers. The projected backgrounds are vivid and Celtic-inspired, reminding me once again of Riverdance.Although the DVD label claims that there is a documentary and biography, both claims are misleading. There is a short promo for *a* documentary, and a very brief biography of the band in general. Barrage: The World on Stage is perfect for aspiring stepdancers, fiddlers, violinists, and anyone who loves Celtic music and a rowdy good time (think Canadian family group Leahy).",5,"Spirited, unconventional approach to Celtic, folk and more..",1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,975,"['had', 'great', 'fortune', 'see', 'Barrage', 'concert', 'last', 'winter', 'was', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'high-octane', 'performance', 'Made', 'eight', 'Canadian', 'violinists/dancers/vocalists', 'additional', 'musicians', 'percussion', 'bass', 'Barrage', 'brimming', 'youthful', 'energy', 'music', 'blend', 'Celtic', 'folk', 'Eastern', 'big', 'band', 'swing', 'eight', 'performers', 'also', 'sing', 'dance', 'fiddling', 'blend', 'Riverdance', 'Stomp', 'concert', 'interspersed', 'comments', 'various', 'performers', 'projected', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'vivid', 'Celtic-inspired', 'reminding', 'once', 'again', 'Riverdance.Although', 'DVD', 'label', 'claims', 'documentary', 'biography', 'claims', 'are', 'misleading', 'short', 'promo', '*a*', 'documentary', 'very', 'brief', 'biography', 'band', 'general', 'Barrage', 'World', 'Stage', 'perfect', 'aspiring', 'stepdancers', 'fiddlers', 'violinists', 'anyone', 'who', 'Celtic', 'music', 'rowdy', 'good', 'time', 'think', 'Canadian', 'family', 'group', 'Leahy']",N/A
