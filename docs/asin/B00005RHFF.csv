Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[2, 5]","This is not like most teen movie sequels (remember Porky's II?) in that it keeps well up to the standards of the first. The gang is all there from the first movie, but here they have left school and we see them going off on holiday after their first term in college. The main four characters decide rent a beach house while... you guessed it, Allyson Hannigan goes off to Band Camp! There are some great moments like when Jim accidentally mixes up a tube of lubricant with a tube of superglue, and well you can guess what happens. The supporting cast is also here, but it's Eugene Levy who really shines. Playing Jim's Dad, he is so incredibly dead-pan in his portrayal of an awkward embarrassed father who wants to do the right thing for his son. He had me rolling off my chair in laughter. Stiffler's Mom also returns, but for a brief cameo, and Allyson Hannigan could also have featured more prominently. The only quibble with the story is that the first movie's premise of a pact between the four guys couldn't really be repeated, but it's a brave attempt and the documentaries included with the DVD show what a lot of fun the cast and crew had making it.",4,Very Funny - Eugene Levy Steals the show again,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,1159,"['not', 'most', 'teen', 'movie', 'sequels', 'remember', 'Porky', 'II', 'well', 'up', 'standards', 'first', 'gang', 'there', 'first', 'movie', 'here', 'have', 'left', 'school', 'see', 'going', 'off', 'holiday', 'first', 'term', 'college', 'main', 'four', 'characters', 'decide', 'rent', 'beach', 'house', 'guessed', 'Allyson', 'Hannigan', 'Band', 'Camp', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'when', 'Jim', 'accidentally', 'up', 'tube', 'lubricant', 'tube', 'superglue', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'here', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'who', 'really', 'shines', 'Playing', 'Jim', 'Dad', 'so', 'incredibly', 'dead-pan', 'portrayal', 'awkward', 'embarrassed', 'father', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'son', 'had', 'rolling', 'off', 'chair', 'laughter', 'Stiffler', 'Mom', 'also', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Allyson', 'Hannigan', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'featured', 'more', 'prominently', 'only', 'quibble', 'story', 'first', 'movie', 'premise', 'pact', 'four', 'guys', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'repeated', 'brave', 'attempt', 'documentaries', 'included', 'DVD', 'show', 'what', 'lot', 'fun', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'making']",American Pie / American Pie 2

679242,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B00005RHFF,S. Morales,"[1, 5]","American Pie 1 is definitely worth checking out, it has the comedy, charm, and sleaziness that were once great in the 80's but were lost in the 90's. It's a high school film that could've been a little more serious, but it was serious enough, and definitely portrayed young high school boys the way most of them really are. Yes, they're horny and stupid sometimes, but also have feelings and are confused about love, and can be as lonely as anyone now matter what their ""status"" is. I definitely recommend it.American Pie 2 takes the same cast a year later once in college. This one isn't as good. Why? B/c it's completely full of college cliches and stereotypes. The actors acting abilites just seemed to worsen dramatically (the whole story with those 2 x-lovebirds coming back together as ""friends"" after a year was so ridiculously stupid and unrealistic it made me wanna vomit, not to mention how laughably horrible they acted it out), and the college experience as a whole was completely superficial. Granted there are a couple of funny parts during the film, they're mostly unnessecary goofy antics that are really the only things holding the movie up.Even though the first was pretty good, both films' depictions of the teenage obsession with sex went a little far sometimes, it becomes hard to believe. Ask any REAL highschooler, having sex at that age isn't as huge a deal as it is portrayed, and if it is a huge deal, it's because of movies like this.
