707666,AD4CDZK7D31XP,B000069HZ4,Anthony Accordino,"[11, 11]","Dave Mason sounds as good today as he did 30 years ago.  This latest live concert &quot;Live At Sunrise&quot; shows that this legendary rock guitarist has not lost a step in his ability to play or sing.  The DVD quality is crystal clear with superior digital surround sound.  It's is such a pleasure to actually watch a musician with talent who can actually play as compared to these modern day computerized lip-synchronized pop phenoms who can't sing a note let alone play?  Dave and his band turn in some fine performances such as &quot;Only You Know And I Know&quot;, &quot;We Just Disagree, the Traffic classics, &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot; and a blistering version of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; which has become a standard at a Dave Mason concert.  He continues to sing as if he were still 25 years old and this concert is as good if not better then his classic 1976 &quot;Certified live&quot; album.  A bonus live behind the scenes interview is very interesting as mason is seen giving pointers to his band members backstage.  He also makes it clear that he would like to reunite with old Traffic mates Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi just once more.  My only complaint is the concert could have been a tad longer[only nine songs] clocking in at 66 minutes.  Still this is all quality and if your a fan of classic rock music, it does not get any better than this.",5,He's Feelin Alright!,1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,1411,"['Dave', 'Mason', 'as', 'good', 'today', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'latest', 'live', 'concert', 'quot', 'Live', 'Sunrise', 'quot', 'legendary', 'rock', 'guitarist', 'not', 'lost', 'step', 'ability', 'play', 'sing', 'DVD', 'quality', 'crystal', 'clear', 'superior', 'digital', 'surround', 'sound', 'such', 'pleasure', 'actually', 'watch', 'musician', 'talent', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'compared', 'modern', 'day', 'computerized', 'lip-synchronized', 'pop', 'phenoms', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'note', 'let', 'alone', 'play', 'Dave', 'band', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'such', 'quot', 'Only', 'Know', 'Know', 'quot', 'quot', 'Just', 'Disagree', 'Traffic', 'classics', 'quot', 'Dear', 'Mr.', 'Fantasy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Feelin', 'Alright', 'quot', 'blistering', 'version', 'quot', 'All', 'Watchtower', 'quot', 'become', 'standard', 'Dave', 'Mason', 'concert', 'sing', 'were', 'still', '25', 'years', 'old', 'concert', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'then', 'classic', '1976', 'quot', 'Certified', 'live', 'quot', 'album', 'bonus', 'live', 'scenes', 'interview', 'very', 'interesting', 'mason', 'seen', 'giving', 'pointers', 'band', 'members', 'backstage', 'also', 'clear', 'would', 'like', 'reunite', 'old', 'Traffic', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'Jim', 'Capaldi', 'just', 'once', 'more', 'only', 'complaint', 'concert', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tad', 'longer', 'only', 'nine', 'songs', ']', 'clocking', '66', 'minutes', 'Still', 'quality', 'fan', 'classic', 'rock', 'music', 'not', 'get', 'better']",N/A

Dave's ""people' just got him a pick up band and went out and did a splendid job. The crowd began to irritate him because they kept wanting to know when there would be a Traffic reunion. He was clearly available but Steve Winwood's ego would never allow them to play on a stage together again (he never forgave Mason for recording ""Alone Together"" LP, by the way, buy the CD fabulous) and wouldn't allow Dave back in the group. Kind of funny though, he did the Blind Faith thing and returned to Traffic???Buy this DVD, Dave covers the songs you are wanting to hear and age hasn't hurt his voice or his guitar playing.",5,"Dave With A ""Pick Up"" Band",1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,689,"['enjoyed', 'green', 'room', 'players', 'show', 'Dave', 'people', 'just', 'got', 'pick', 'up', 'band', 'went', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'crowd', 'began', 'irritate', 'kept', 'wanting', 'know', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'Traffic', 'reunion', 'was', 'clearly', 'available', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'ego', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'play', 'stage', 'together', 'again', 'never', 'forgave', 'Mason', 'recording', 'Alone', 'Together', 'LP', 'way', 'buy', 'CD', 'fabulous', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Dave', 'back', 'group', 'Kind', 'funny', 'did', 'Blind', 'Faith', 'thing', 'returned', 'Traffic', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'Dave', 'songs', 'are', 'wanting', 'hear', 'age', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'voice', 'guitar', 'playing']",N/A

Dave still has a great voice and man he can still play. The song selection was excellent, I also have (Live At Perkins Palace) in my opinion I think that one is not as good.

Some are better than others but occasionally you come across a real gem.  Such is Live at Sunrise.  Sound and video are excellent and the camera work is some of the best.  You actually get to focus on the camera shots.  This is how a show should be recorded - lots of stage shots and close ups of Dave's very talented playing (as well as the other members).
