The customer reviews of this movie spiked my interest.  It is a very good movie, but it is long so plan the time to watch it accordingly.  Swayze's charcter in this movie is similar to his character in his last work, ""The Beast"", which aired last season on A&E TV (exceptional work).  My husband and I watched it together and both enjoyed it.  We will keep it in our home media library to enjoy again.  I recommend it both as a good movie and to Swayze fans.",5,Icon,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,580,"['Being', 'Swayze', 'fan', 'being', 'sad', 'health', 'now', 'death', 'was', 'looking', 'work', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'customer', 'reviews', 'movie', 'spiked', 'interest', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'long', 'so', 'plan', 'time', 'watch', 'accordingly', 'Swayze', 'charcter', 'movie', 'similar', 'character', 'last', 'work', 'Beast', 'aired', 'last', 'season', 'A', 'E', 'TV', 'exceptional', 'work', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'keep', 'home', 'media', 'library', 'enjoy', 'again', 'recommend', 'good', 'movie', 'Swayze', 'fans']",N/A

1120011,APJ65ZLLUX4G,B000YIGNGS,Gueorgui Lazarov Stoychev,"[1, 3]","From the very beginning one can see that it was a very cheap, low budget series or movie, whatever. There're some shots in Moscow but it was cheaper to film in Sofia, Bulgaria, and using Bulgarian actors in Russian roles. Easy, most of them already speak Russian. There's a bomb explosion, a deadly virus stolen and a police ... woman? There's only one important character in the book and that is a British embassy employee, Celia Stone. OK if you want to please the female audience, but you scare the male 'cause skeleton looking Annika Peterson moves around probably with batteries and suffers from bulimia and anorexia at the same time, besides being a pretty bad actress.There's a so called Black Manifesto stolen in the book, no deadly virus. Who was the idiot who wrote the script? Yes, I know, I saw his name in the end credits, but why on Earth Forsyth accepted the destruction of his book? Yes, there are too many time jumps, but that's what makes it great and filled with suspense. Well, probably it was that old saying that ""everybody's got a price"".So, our ""hero"" is living in Andalusia (wrong, it should be written correctly Andalucia, yes, with a C), by a ... lake? There are no lakes in Andalucia. In the book Jason Monk was stationed at one point in Madrid, Spain, but that is far away from Turks and Caicos in the West Indies. Besides, Michael York didn't manage to portray the old British chap and gentleman Sir Nigel Irvine is supposed to be in the book. The fact that he was born in England doesn't make him suitable for that role. Pity South African born Nigel Green died so many years ago.No more comments 'cause at this point of the movie I stood up and jerked the DVD out of the player in order to put it in its rightful place ... the garbage.Buy the book, read it and enjoy the real stuff. Even if the end feels a little bit like a trick pulled out of a hat, it gave me great pleasure and I felt satisfied with it.

And the movie is nothing like it. I can understand that Frederick Forsyth's original story might have been too tough to transfer to the big screen but the movie lacks the Forsythian complexity and intrigue of the book.  Compared with the book the movie plot is insipid. I'm surprised that Forsyth had anything to do with it (he was a story consultant or somesuch).
