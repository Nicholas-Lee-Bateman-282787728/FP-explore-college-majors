844927,AJZDZ3KG9N9NB,B0002TSZFQ,watchit,"[3, 3]","After loving the books as a kid, I now read them to my own children, yet wanted the video version on hand to see how the producers made the adaptation. (Sigh). Emmy-winning or not, the HBO Family adaptation replaces the child's imagination with that of the animation company and pads the storylines to fill 22 minutes for each episode. The pan-and-scan version that Captain Kangaroo ran back in the 50s seemed so much better because it stuck to the drawings and text of the book and let the child do the extrapolating. I know this is how it's done today, but it's so sad. I think I'll keep the DVDs on the shelf for now.",3,Case of the Cutes,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,620,"['loving', 'books', 'kid', 'now', 'read', 'own', 'children', 'yet', 'wanted', 'video', 'version', 'hand', 'see', 'how', 'producers', 'made', 'adaptation', 'Sigh', 'Emmy-winning', 'not', 'HBO', 'Family', 'adaptation', 'child', 'imagination', 'animation', 'company', 'storylines', 'fill', '22', 'minutes', 'episode', 'pan-and-scan', 'version', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'ran', 'back', '50s', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'stuck', 'drawings', 'text', 'book', 'let', 'child', 'do', 'extrapolating', 'know', 'how', 'done', 'today', 'so', 'sad', 'think', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'DVDs', 'shelf', 'now']",Harold and the Purple Crayon - The Complete Series
