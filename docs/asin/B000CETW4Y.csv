Japanese soldiers and their government have acknowledged the atrocities, but their other words and deeds militate against those declarations.The view that the perpetrators were heroes remains undiminished in Japan, which has never come out of denial. Official declarations and actions have always shown ambivalence about their barbarous use of sexual slaves in conquered lands. Their euphemism, ""comfort women"" likens their forced prostitutes to the equivalent of a comfy sofa or a bowl of soup. While many soldiers frankly admit to this practice as a routine during their invasion of Korea and China, a few still claim that some women offered themselves voluntarily. Their feeble efforts to prosecute perpetrators, and the way Japan has always stopped short of outrage, signal a qualified contrition.Something absent from the Japanese heart rooted the depravities at Nanking and beyond. As this movie shows, their slaughter of innocents, where the bodies were notoriously piled high, was followed by soldiers engaged in normal, innocent pursuits: boot-polishing, dancing, reading girlfriends' mail, teasing one another.While no high cinematic achievement, this movie goes beyond a simple, documentary-like telling of Chinese suffering by a force lacking in charity, empathy and scruples. Some characters portray that not all Chinese are good, and the invaders aren't invariably inhuman. One Japanese soldier is pained when his companions wrong a sex slave he has tried to befriend; a Chinese man compromises his principles to save his family. These are *individual* agents, even as the brutes line up to kill by fornication.The west's entrenched principles of fairness and charity, through the Geneva Convention, caution against state-sponsored depravity; still, all who utter such ideals are no less prone to breaking them. Young Germans today feel no complicity for the genocide over which their people presided, and understandably. Perhaps Japan's leaders wait until no one remains to take responsibility for their savagery; Germany at least acknowledged its role in Nazi atrocities, and made gestures toward reparations.This film should be compulsory viewing in every Japanese school.",5,Should be compulsory viewing in every Japanese school,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2410,"['scandal', 'blot', 'great', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'adamantly', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Nanking', 'Singapore', 'elsewhere', 'where', 'matchstick', 'ghosts', 'emerged', 'prisons', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'government', 'have', 'acknowledged', 'atrocities', 'other', 'words', 'deeds', 'militate', 'declarations.The', 'view', 'perpetrators', 'were', 'heroes', 'remains', 'undiminished', 'Japan', 'never', 'come', 'denial', 'Official', 'declarations', 'actions', 'have', 'always', 'shown', 'ambivalence', 'barbarous', 'use', 'sexual', 'slaves', 'conquered', 'lands', 'euphemism', 'comfort', 'women', 'forced', 'prostitutes', 'equivalent', 'comfy', 'sofa', 'bowl', 'soup', 'many', 'soldiers', 'frankly', 'admit', 'practice', 'routine', 'invasion', 'Korea', 'China', 'few', 'still', 'claim', 'women', 'offered', 'voluntarily', 'feeble', 'efforts', 'prosecute', 'perpetrators', 'way', 'Japan', 'always', 'stopped', 'short', 'outrage', 'qualified', 'contrition.Something', 'absent', 'Japanese', 'heart', 'rooted', 'depravities', 'Nanking', 'movie', 'slaughter', 'innocents', 'where', 'bodies', 'were', 'notoriously', 'piled', 'high', 'was', 'followed', 'soldiers', 'engaged', 'normal', 'innocent', 'pursuits', 'boot-polishing', 'dancing', 'reading', 'girlfriends', 'mail', 'teasing', 'one', 'another.While', 'high', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'movie', 'simple', 'documentary-like', 'telling', 'Chinese', 'suffering', 'force', 'lacking', 'charity', 'empathy', 'scruples', 'characters', 'portray', 'not', 'Chinese', 'are', 'good', 'invaders', 'are', ""n't"", 'invariably', 'inhuman', 'One', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'pained', 'when', 'companions', 'wrong', 'sex', 'slave', 'tried', 'befriend', 'Chinese', 'man', 'principles', 'save', 'family', 'are', '*individual*', 'agents', 'even', 'brutes', 'line', 'kill', 'fornication.The', 'west', 'entrenched', 'principles', 'fairness', 'charity', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'caution', 'state-sponsored', 'depravity', 'still', 'who', 'utter', 'such', 'ideals', 'are', 'less', 'prone', 'breaking', 'Germans', 'today', 'feel', 'complicity', 'genocide', 'people', 'presided', 'understandably', 'Perhaps', 'Japan', 'leaders', 'wait', 'one', 'take', 'responsibility', 'savagery', 'Germany', 'least', 'acknowledged', 'role', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'made', 'gestures', 'reparations.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'compulsory', 'viewing', 'Japanese', 'school']",The Rape of Nanking

At that time, the images shown on screen were shocking to me, but now, it could qualify to be shown to kindergarten children if this film (being reviewed) is to be considered as entertainment.How can anyone say they are repulsed by the savage tradegies suffered at the World Trade Center on 9/11 if they seek out the brutality represented in this documentary.For educational purposes?

When ignorant people complain that American World WAr 2 films made during the war were supposedly racist, what they do not realize is that compared to the reality, the cinematic Imperial Japanese are practically genteel. The reality was a savagery beyond belief. Worse than the Nazis. Comparable to the Communist Death Camps but far more widespread and ""creative"" on the part of the perpetrators.  It would be good to report that this doc is superb but it is a tad ratty and clunky with footage being repeated and narration saying pretty much the same things again and again.  If shortened by about 15 mins, the doc would be greatly improved. That said, it is still a watchable, harrowing and educational film with much historical footage that this old newsreel/documentary veteran had not seen before and covering a subject that all too many people know nothing about.
