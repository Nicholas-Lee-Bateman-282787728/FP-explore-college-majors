399187,A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ,6304071825,"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover""","[2, 2]","I also love this performance.  The source being a run of performances in England, each character is literally performing the work with an overview frequently missing in piece-meal performances.  I just want to add, however, that buried in the names of the other actors is one ""Mike Gambon"".  He later went on to play the role of the Vicar in Ghosts for BBC (with Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson and Freddie Jones) and to become the replacement for Richard Harris in the Harry Potter series.  You just never know where famous actors get their start.When I first saw this movie, it was in an art house movie theater.  Two weeks later, they revived the movie of Hamlet with Olivier.  The best anyone can say of any actor is that Hamlet and Othello were not the same person at all.  The walk, the voice, the movements, the size were all different.  Compare that to his King Lear (much later), and yet another actor emerges.  It made me realize how total the immersion of Olivier into the characters was.Someone has mentioned that Maggie Smith might not be the vulnerable person they envision.  In earlier times for a white woman to love a black man would have taken considerable chutzpah.  That does not mean vulnerable to me.  I suspect Desdemona was of sterner stuff.When will this be issued on Blu-Ray?",5,Just an added note.,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",2008,1317,"['also', 'love', 'performance', 'source', 'being', 'run', 'performances', 'England', 'character', 'literally', 'performing', 'work', 'overview', 'frequently', 'missing', 'piece-meal', 'performances', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'however', 'buried', 'names', 'other', 'actors', 'one', 'Mike', 'Gambon', 'later', 'went', 'play', 'role', 'Vicar', 'Ghosts', 'BBC', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'become', 'replacement', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'famous', 'actors', 'get', 'start.When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'art', 'house', 'movie', 'theater', 'Two', 'weeks', 'later', 'revived', 'movie', 'Hamlet', 'Olivier', 'best', 'anyone', 'can', 'say', 'actor', 'Hamlet', 'Othello', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'person', 'walk', 'voice', 'movements', 'size', 'were', 'different', 'Compare', 'King', 'Lear', 'much', 'later', 'yet', 'actor', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'total', 'immersion', 'Olivier', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'envision', 'earlier', 'times', 'white', 'woman', 'love', 'black', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'considerable', 'chutzpah', 'not', 'mean', 'vulnerable', 'suspect', 'Desdemona', 'was', 'sterner', 'stuff.When', 'will', 'be', 'issued', 'Blu-Ray']",Othello VHS
399188,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,6304071825,Alexander Arsov,"[2, 2]","The three movies I have seen since I became fairly well familiar with the play are Oliver Parker's 1996 one, starring Laurence Fishburne as Othello and Kenneth Branagh as Iago; Stuart Burge's 1965 version, starring Laurence Olivier and Frank Finlay; and Orson Welles' 1952 adaptation which he directed and starred in the title role. The first and the third are full-scale movies, so to say, while the second is really John Dexter's 1964 production in the National Theatre captured on film.================================================Orson Welles turned out to be much more disappointing than I expected - at least as an actor. He greatly downplays the character, emphasising the nobility, and that's fine with me. The trouble is that he goes too far and Othello comes off very unconvincingly as a meek lamb. Welles, moreover, often seems too preoccupied with the words and pays too little attention to their meaning. At least to me, he seldom sounds like human being.As a director, however, Welles is brilliant. Except for a few rough moments, when one is at loss what actually happens, the movie is a visual tour de force. It's black-and-white, of course, and the camera work is not up to modern standards, but there are many images that are quite haunting. The opening scene provides a memorable example. It shows the funeral of Othello and Desdemona, with Iago being locked up in a hanging cage. This is not in the play, but it looks majestic on the screen. Throughout the whole movie Welles' use of visual angles and lighting is masterful.Unfortunately, the visual side is the only real merit of this film. Why it is so generously praised generally I really don't know. The play is severely cut, with explanatory narratives inserted occasionally, and both the continuity and the characters suffer from that. Orson Welles is easily the finest part of the cast, but that's simply because the rest is dismal. I don't even remember the names of those who played Iago, Desdemona and Cassio. They are not worth remembering anyway.It's a fascinating historical curiosity, the Welles' Othello, but hardly anything more.====================================================Stuart Burge's movie is remarkably fine visually. It is rather static compared to the modern Hollywood wonders, but for a filmed stage production it is very well shot and very well directed. The sets and the costumes are simple and repetitive, but effective enough. The movie now comes in superb stereo sound that renders every word with exemplary clarity, and in splendid colour that's quite amazing for a 1965 production of BHE (British Home Entertainment). Last but not least, there are relatively few cuts, mostly judicious ones (e.g. the rhymed couplets of Brabantio and the Duke in Act I), occasionally not so (e.g. Iago's turning Desdemona's virtue into a pitch to enmesh them all).Leaving aside problems with interpretations, the acting is absolutely outstanding. People who still claim that Shakespeare cannot be spoken naturally should really see this film. The flow of speech is nearly flawless, the rhythm and the various inflections are magnificently executed. Nearly every word is audible, and it is worth hearing. Looking into the parts themselves, however, reveal some disturbing nuances.The chief bone of contention is Olivier's Othello. This is an extremely unorthodox and controversial interpretation. And I would lie if I said that I enjoyed it half as much as Olivier's Hamlet or Richard III. For the sake of charity I will pass over the horrendous make-up (this Othello evidently comes from Sudan, if not from Congo), the weird accent and the clumsy walk: no doubt quite acceptable for the Elizabethan audience, if not for the modern one. My only concern here is not that this is a slightly racist treatment of the character (though that's bad enough), but that I am not sure the delivery of the poetry is true to Shakespeare's spirit.Olivier's Othello is a perplexing affair. Virtually all great scenes with him - with the Venetian senate in Act I, with Iago in Act III, with Desdemona and Emilia in Act IV, the final one in Act V - are bizarre mixtures of deeply moving moments that nearly bring tears to my eyes and hammy histrionics that border on farcical caricature. It goes without saying that Othello is a part that would benefit from some overt-the-top acting - but within a reason. Olivier's Moor all too often looks and sounds like a savage, and hardly the noble one. Now Othello is keen on exaggerating his own crudeness - ''Rude am I in speech'' - but there is hardly anything in his lines to suggest such shouting and crying, not to mention the elaborate gymnastics. In his more restrained moments, Olivier is deeply affecting.Whatever misgivings one might have about Olivier's interpretation of Othello - and I have many - it cannot be denied that his acting has consistency and coherence that are quite compelling. It's nearly impossible for me to believe that this is the same man who played Richard III ten years earlier and Hamlet still seven years before that. It's not just the make-up, although it does help. The voice, much lower than usual, and the whole body language are startlingly different in every aspect. I have seldom been convinced in Olivier's nearly mythical status as strongly as when I watch his Othello. I completely disagree with a thousand things, yet I can't get my eyes off him. This must be great acting all right.Certainly, if Othello moves you deeply, you should see this movie. If it doesn't, of course you shouldn't. Despite my reservations, I am glad that Olivier (58 years old in 1965) finally managed to preserve his Othello for posterity.Iago of Frank Finlay is every bit as accomplished but very nearly perfect interpretation-wise. I often see his performance described as ''underplayed''. This, thank Heavens, is quite true. It is absolutely essential that Iago must not be made into a bluff jester, for then the rest of the cast look very stupid for being taken in. There are at least four Iagos in the play - with Othello, with Cassio, with Roderigo, with Emilia - and Finlay is totally convincing on all fronts. Not only the other characters, but the audience, too, is never in doubt about his honesty. Because of his marvellous restraint, the few slightly outlandish gestures he allows himself (e.g. imitating a bull with horns) are all the more charming and effective.(A piece of trivia for movie buffs. If you have the nagging doubt that Frank Finlay seems familiar to you, that you have seen him somewhere else much older, this may be because he played the part of the Father in Roman Polanski's The Pianist, some 37 years after this Othello. Mr Finlay has aged well; his face is still recognisable, although Iago's grey hair has turned into snowy white.)The rest of the cast is very fine indeed. Maggie Smith actually makes Desdemona better than she is on paper. Who cares about Desdemona really? She is just a piece of stage furniture, dramatically very convenient but with no character at all. Well, Maggie Smith made me feel almost sorry for her in the end. The young and dashing Derek Jacobi is a terrific Cassio to the last word; his drunken scene is hilarious. Joyce Redman, apart from her nearly losing her voice from shouting in the final scene, is a most decent Emilia.================================================Oliver Parker's movie is visually impressive and makes a fine use of the many advantages offered by modern cinema. The diversity of locations is wonderful, the sets and the costumes are sumptuous historical affairs, the direction nearly perfect, with lots of fine close-ups. The play is much cut, of course, but most of the finest passages - Iago's soliloquies, Othello's final speech - are retained, although the action may seem a little rushed from time to time.I am dismayed to see the movie accused of ''excessive sexuality''. There is no such thing. There are some steamy scenes, certainly, but all of them, the consummation of Othello's marriage and his fantasies about Cassio and Desdemona, are crucial to the plot - unless one takes a prudish point of view that hardly suits Shakespeare. All sex scenes, of course, are very stylishly done. For my part they add a special flavour which makes the whole story more convincing. It might be argued, however, that this shifts Othello's feelings too much to the carnal side. Then again, this is an adaptation, and it should be expected to take liberties with the original.The cast is the real problem in this movie.Laurence Fishburne looks fine for Othello, and he is an excellent actor, but his delivery of the text is problematic. Only in the final scene he finally manages to convey something of the Moor's innate nobility of soul. But in many other places - the Venetian senate, the brawl - he completely fails to project Othello's natural authority. All too often his delivery of the poetry sounds too mechanical, too calculated, too artificial. He seems much too concerned about his pronunciation, but not enough about the meaning of the words; the Welles Syndrome, only much aggravated. When there is no talking - the epileptic fit, the first jealous thoughts, the smothering of Desdemona - Fishburne delivers passionate and compelling performances.Irene Jacob is an even greater disappointment. Leaving aside that her large features don't fit my personal ideas of feminine loveliness, she is even more stilted and wooden than Fishburne. Even in the final scene she doesn't manage to do anything memorable. Then again, as I said, her character is hardly worth bothering about. One nice little change of the original is Desdemona's recovery of consciousness only to die without uttering a word. Perhaps I am too harsh on the girl. Considering that this is not just her first Shakespearean experience, but first movie in English at all, she could have been much worse.Kenneth Branagh completely steals the show. That's to be expected, of course. He is the only one among the principals with any experience with Shakespeare. He is almost a Shakespearean veteran: on the next year he made his Hamlet (1996), behind his back he already had Henry V (1989) and Much Ado About Nothing (1993).Now this is a tremendous interpretation of Iago. I am as much fascinated with it as I am disappointed with Branagh's Hamlet. There are no hammy histrionics here. This Iago is no cheap buffoon that makes you wonder how anybody, let alone everybody, could trust him. Branagh's acting is so convincing that one can almost believe that Iago really cares for Othello's suffering, really wants to help Roderigo, really is sorry for Cassio's loss of reputation. Indeed, in his first soliloquy Iago may almost make you feel sorry for him!Much of this fascination comes from the fact that Iago delivers all of his soliloquies directly to the camera, an approach I have always found extremely compelling. Occasionally, he also glances furtively to the camera, as if to invite you in his private machinations. One such moment is when he hugs Roderigo, who is totally taken in that the Ancient would give everything to help him. We know better: a single glance by Branagh is enough to convince us that Roderigo is already a dead man. And there is one other moment, even more effective, when Iago, while reflecting how he would turn Desdemona's virtue into a net to enmesh them all, actually blackens the camera with his own hand. Now this is brilliant, or, in another four words: great acting, great directing.My only slight disappointment with Iago, or rather with the adaptation, is that in the final scene he should lie, stabbed and probably dying, together with the other three corpses. It's not that Iago doesn't deserve death. It's just not dramatically effective. A much better solution would have been his regarding the bloodshed in the bed with an ironic smile.The supporting cast has some fine members. Michael Maloney is a great Roderigo; quite an achievement considering how ungrateful the part is. Nathaniel Parker is good if a little bland as Cassio. (Interestingly enough, both of these actors have played on the screen Laertes from Hamlet: Michael in Branagh's adaptation, 1996; Nathaniel in Zeffirelli's, 1990.) The completely unknown to me Anna Patrick, an actress with singularly square but not unattractive face, is a superb Emilia; she almost stole the final scene from Othello. Pierre Vaneck is remarkably memorable in the minor part of Brabantio. It was a pleasure to see again Gabriele Ferzetti (the Duke). Nearly three decades earlier he had become well-known as the railroad tycoon Morton from Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

Anyone even minimally familiar with Shakespeare criticism knows that, as the play is written, the Moor's tragic flaw is not that he is prone to jealousy, but that he over-dramatizes his self-image. He exaggerates his role in life as a great military commander, with excessive rhetorical relish, and sees himself as a man for whom personal honour and glory are of greater intrinsic importance than anything else, including love, loyalty and forgiveness. This is why and how Iago succeeds in making such a fool of him.The role itself is therefore ideally suited to Olivier's over-the-top theatrical style. To complain that this is a filmed stage play is idiotic, since it never pretends to be anything else. That is exactly what it sets out to be: a permanent record on film of a stage production. It is also idiotic to protest that Olivier is a white man playing the part in black make-up: that is how Shakespeare wrote it, 400 years ago, and there is nothing that can now be done to alter it, like it or not.Olivier's performance is utterly compelling. Only the semi-literate, or those with the aesthetic sensitivity of a rhinoceros, can fail to be gripped and transfixed by this superb interpretation of one of the most diabolically well-written masterpieces of European theatre. It is interesting to note that such is Shakespeare's genius for stage-craft that even modern ten-year-old American kids (of normal intelligence) can easily follow the development of the drama, in spite of the apparently archaic language.Finlay's Iago and Redman's Emilia match Olivier. Maggie Smith's Desdemona is very fine, although I see the role played by someone just a touch more delicate and vulnerable. The stage direction is masterly, and the few simple sets are also excellently conceived. Shakespeare's tragedies are, by their very nature, overpowering works: Olivier understands the timing and significance of every word, and delivers the lines in a manner entirely appropriate to their original creation. I haven't seen all the other Othellos by the many other actors, but can only suspect that their performances, whether by white players or black, must fade and pale by comparison.These comments relate to the BHE dvd version, digitally remastered by Warner, which also includes a fragmentary interview with Anthony Hopkins, cast profiles, as well as a brief account of Shakespeare's sources for the play, and its theatrical history.",5,Magnificent  Pinnacle of Drama,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,2502,"['Olivier', 'finest', 'performance', 'Archie', 'Rice', 'close', 'Anyone', 'even', 'minimally', 'familiar', 'Shakespeare', 'criticism', 'that', 'play', 'written', 'Moor', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'not', 'prone', 'jealousy', 'self-image', 'role', 'life', 'great', 'military', 'commander', 'excessive', 'rhetorical', 'relish', 'man', 'whom', 'personal', 'honour', 'glory', 'are', 'greater', 'intrinsic', 'importance', 'anything', 'else', 'including', 'love', 'loyalty', 'forgiveness', 'why', 'how', 'Iago', 'making', 'such', 'fool', 'him.The', 'role', 'therefore', 'ideally', 'suited', 'Olivier', 'over-the-top', 'theatrical', 'style', 'complain', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'idiotic', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'exactly', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'permanent', 'record', 'film', 'stage', 'production', 'also', 'idiotic', 'protest', 'Olivier', 'white', 'man', 'playing', 'part', 'black', 'make-up', 'how', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', '400', 'years', 'ago', 'nothing', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'done', 'alter', 'performance', 'utterly', 'compelling', 'Only', 'semi-literate', 'aesthetic', 'sensitivity', 'rhinoceros', 'can', 'fail', 'be', 'gripped', 'transfixed', 'superb', 'interpretation', 'one', 'most', 'diabolically', 'well-written', 'masterpieces', 'European', 'theatre', 'interesting', 'note', 'such', 'Shakespeare', 'genius', 'stage-craft', 'even', 'modern', 'ten-year-old', 'American', 'kids', 'normal', 'intelligence', 'can', 'easily', 'follow', 'development', 'drama', 'spite', 'apparently', 'archaic', 'language.Finlay', 'Iago', 'Redman', 'Emilia', 'match', 'Olivier', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Desdemona', 'very', 'fine', 'see', 'role', 'played', 'someone', 'just', 'touch', 'more', 'delicate', 'vulnerable', 'stage', 'direction', 'masterly', 'few', 'simple', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'excellently', 'conceived', 'Shakespeare', 'tragedies', 'are', 'very', 'nature', 'overpowering', 'works', 'Olivier', 'timing', 'significance', 'word', 'lines', 'manner', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'original', 'creation', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'Othellos', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'suspect', 'performances', 'white', 'players', 'black', 'must', 'fade', 'pale', 'comparison.These', 'comments', 'relate', 'BHE', 'dvd', 'version', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Warner', 'also', 'fragmentary', 'interview', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'cast', 'profiles', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'account', 'Shakespeare', 'sources', 'play', 'theatrical', 'history']",Othello VHS

I'm definitely in the like category. I don't love it but neither do I hate it. I don't have a problem with the black make-up in view of the overtly theatrical nature of the film (Olivier's Arab make-up in KHARTOUM the following year would have been more accurate) and as for his accent, listen to recordings of Paul Robeson's Othello (they exist) and you'll hear a startling similarity. The new widescreen DVD transfer restores some of his body movements which were virtually impossible to see in the old VHS version. What we have is a very theatrical performance of its time captured on film and it needs to be viewed as such. In fact all of the performances are larger than life even Maggie Smith's Desdemona which is stronger than most Desdemonas. It is, however, this very theatricality that gives the film its power. I can clearly understand Shakespeare's text (people not used to it should use the subtitles which are a great help) and the motivations of the characters while Geoffrey Unsworth's photography, when seen in the proper aspect, helps to focus our attention on the play especially when Iago is on screen.Frank Finlay's Iago is the centerpiece that all the other characters gravitate to. In this version we can not only see his villainy at work but the thought processes behind it. His astonishing performance takes full advantage of Shakespeare's lines. Derek Jacobi's Cassio allows us to see more of the man than I have seen in other film versions (his drunk scene is very revealing) and makes him more of a character than a pawn in Iago's scheme. Finally praise needs to be given to Robert Lang's Roderigo who is not just a two dimensional dupe. Throw in Joyce Redman's Emilia and you have the strongest overall cast that I have ever seen in the too few film versions of this play. In fact they are not only on a par with Olivier but often surpass him. It goes without saying that this movie won't be for all tastes. For those of you looking for a more modern and realistic film of OTHELLO, watch the 1995 Laurence Fishburne version and no version is more cinematic than Orson Welles' 1952 film. However for sheer acting firepower and interpretation of the text, this version can't be topped.

I have seen every version of this play that has ever been committed to film, which is no small feat for a woman who adores the Bard as I do.  I am an African American woman and I have heard about the fact that some think that his portrayal of the moor to be stereotypical, well, I don't think so. I think that there is nothing so sweeping as the way that he brings this play to life, Othello is not my favorite Shakespeare play, possibly the third favorite but there is something in the truth of Othello that I think is deeply stirring, it is the truth of self-esteem.  He thinks himself a lowly creature, despite the fact that he is a great general and is acclaimed by many even the trials that he has been through in his life.  Olivier makes you feel that, he wrung tears from me the frist time that I saw him in this performance, like a floodgate, I wanted to hold this wounded man to my heart, he was flawless and seamless, I lost Olivier in this movie, he was purely the character.

399199,A3MR82ZDTWBIAM,6304071825,Mostly Shakespeare,"[1, 1]","This film represents the adaptation of a massively influential production at the Old Vic with the National Theatre. Unfortunately it was rather hastily committed to film. The setting is unapolegitcally theatrical, a largely bare stage. The film stock and development are not of the best, leaving us with a stage the color of orange marmalade and Olivier with a shockingly red mouth. Likewise far too little effort was put into adjusting the lighting for film. The result is that the visual aspect of the film is often disappointing.Olivier's Othello dominates our attention. Many have found this interpretation condescending or, worse, racist. I disagree. Olivier eschews the stiff dignity sometimes brought to the role. Instead this Othello grins, swaggers and generally shows a great deal of bravado. He clearly enjoys the fraternity and masculinity of military life. Yet for Olivier this is not irreconciable with Othello's grand and ultimately tragic dignity and he maintains both aspects brilliantly throughout. Regrettably, never did Oliver become more wrapped up in the physicality of his performance. He gestures high over his head, writhes and falls flat on his face. It's difficult to say how this might have played differently onstage but on on film it seems excessive. As Iago begins to work on Othello, Olivier is already playing with great intensity, giving himself almost nowhere to go. This detracts some of the strongest scenes in the play although much of Olivier's performance is bracingly original and brilliant.Frank Finlay presents a chillingly cold, intellectual Iago. He does not seethe with hidden rage but presents a detatched, almost disinterested cruelty (motiveless malgnity indeed). Maggie Smith presents a reserved, intellegent and supremely politic Desdemona, worlds away from the girlish interpretations of Imogen Stubbs or Joanna Weinberg. These qualities are well on display as she read ""I do percieve here a divided duty"". Derek Jacobi is surprisingly funny as Michael Cassio and Joyce Redman's Emilia is excused from blame for her involvment in the tragedy in view of her desperate need to regain her husband's affections.Smith and Finlay, playing with such reserve, create a subdued and chilly background against which Olivier's Othello explodes. There is real affection between Desdemona and Othello but with such quiet, subtle performances the idyll following the marriage is not overwhelming for the audience. We share in little of Othello's great ""content""; the dominant atmosphere is foreboding. The main difficulty is that due to problems of adaptation and problems with Olivier's performance,this film does not always catch fire when it needs to.

This interpretation is very much  about Hamlet as an action hero, and Kosintesev conveys the force and limits of Hamlet's agency with amazing economy. Claudius's speech begins the film after shots of the ocean (quoting form Olivier's film of Hamlet) Hamlet racing back for the funeral, and a soldier reads the speech as a proclamation to the crowd outside.  We cut to the court where ambassadors and courtiers are translating it into German and French, and then arrive in the courtroom where Claudius finishes it. We see Hamlet listening at the beginning of this shot, but after Laertes and Claudius speak and Claudius addresses Hamlet, we track back to his chair and see that it is empty.  Ophelia, through the soundtrack music, becomes an increasingly mechanical dancer as she goes mad.  This is very much a political interpretation of the play, with no close ups (like Kurosawa's Throne of Blood)  and it is refreshing to see this perspective on the screen.

399202,ANCPT9G4L1JZS,6304071825,"Paul S. Rottenberg ""stevenrothbardt""","[5, 5]","I've been using this film of OTHELLO for about ten years to teach the play. I used to play the video tape, and I remember seeing the movie when it came out in the 60s. I didn't like it much then, but I was much too young.  I remember that I didn't like the big, empty studio spaces up on the movie screen, but they are diminished by the TV screen to a more comfortable size. The main thing in this production, however, is the acting, which is the best overall out of about four major versions (I own them all). Olivier is commanding and very great for at least half the film. The problem is that Olivier is over-acting in the second half of the film, which begins in the play in Act 3, Scene 3, around line 427; however, he recovers balance and is intermittently magnificent till the end, but a' still rages and foams a' th' mouth too much. In fact, in the video OLIVIER, A LIFE, he's critical of his performance himself. However, my students over the past ten years have liked this version best because it contains the clearest, most easily understood acting and speaking that they saw out of several ones I tried in class. Every line is spoken as if this is the way people speak, dispite the four hundred or so years that have passed since this play was written in a language which is the most dynamic and constantly changing of all Western languages. All gestures are pointedly used to underline meaning, and there is a physical energy throughout which is palpable. It's actually more engaging of your attention than most of the other, even newer, versions.A friend and colleague of mine said he didn't like Olivier here because his acting reminded him of ""Some guy from Jamaica,"" and some of my students, many of whom are from Jamaica, still laugh at Olivier's rather dark makeup, even though I warn them beforehand that this production is from the 60s and that it used to be common for English actors to play Othello in greasepaint, though some more recent ones have dealt with the ambiguous nature of the Moor's race (the ""black"" he calls himself is, after all, relative) by not making him a black African at all, since a Moor could certainly be from Libya on the ""Barbary Coast"" (as in Desdemona's old servant Barbary). Some of my students also laugh at Olivier's overacting, though I try to explain it away by telling them that he was playing this role on the stage at the same time he made this movie, and that he forgot to tone down his acting when he got in front of the cameras. Recently, however, I had a student who thought that everything Olivier does is logical, based on the text, and, of course, he's right, in a way. In the end,though, most of my students prefer this version for the reasons I've already mentioned, and I agree with them. It may not be perfect, but none of the other versions are either, and Olivier's Othello is still one of the best because he inhabits the role better than anyone else, even Orson Wells in his classic movie based on the play (which has the second best Iago in Micheal MacLaimmoir, and an excellent Desdemona in Suzanne Cloutier).Of the other cast members, the best, most memorable (and perhaps the most perfect of the whole cast) is Frank Finlay as Iago, who may be the greatest Iago on film or video. He may even be better than Ian Mckellen in the excellent BBC production directed by Trevor Nunn in 1989. That TV version also has the most intellegent choice for Desdemona in Imogen Stubbs since she really looks the part of the probably young girl who falls in love with and marries the Moor. However, Maggie Smith is passable here as Olivier's Desi, and Derek Jacobi is certainly good in what may be his first film role, as Cassio, while Joyce Redman is outstanding and passionate as Emilia.The other versions I like include Orson Wells's 1952 movie version, the 1989 BBC production mentioned above, the 1981 BBC production directed by Colin Lowrey with Anthony Hopkins (some don't like Hopkins's very underplayed performance, the exact antithesis of Olivier's, but it's well-done, I think), and I even sometimes like the 1995 movie with Kenneth Branaugh, although it's perhaps not in the same class as the others.",4,"Outstanding but Flawed, but Perhaps the Best",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,4173,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'film', 'OTHELLO', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'teach', 'play', 'used', 'play', 'video', 'tape', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '60s', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'then', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'big', 'empty', 'studio', 'up', 'movie', 'screen', 'are', 'diminished', 'TV', 'screen', 'more', 'comfortable', 'size', 'main', 'thing', 'production', 'however', 'acting', 'best', 'overall', 'four', 'major', 'versions', 'own', 'Olivier', 'commanding', 'very', 'great', 'least', 'film', 'problem', 'Olivier', 'over-acting', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'play', 'Act', '3', 'Scene', '3', 'around', 'line', '427', 'however', 'balance', 'intermittently', 'magnificent', 'end', 'still', 'th', 'mouth', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'video', 'OLIVIER', 'A', 'LIFE', 'critical', 'performance', 'However', 'students', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'liked', 'version', 'best', 'clearest', 'most', 'easily', 'understood', 'acting', 'speaking', 'saw', 'several', 'ones', 'tried', 'class', 'line', 'spoken', 'way', 'people', 'speak', 'dispite', 'four', 'hundred', 'so', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'language', 'most', 'dynamic', 'constantly', 'changing', 'Western', 'languages', 'gestures', 'are', 'pointedly', 'used', 'underline', 'meaning', 'physical', 'energy', 'palpable', 'actually', 'more', 'engaging', 'attention', 'most', 'other', 'even', 'newer', 'versions.A', 'friend', 'colleague', 'mine', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Olivier', 'here', 'acting', 'reminded', 'guy', 'Jamaica', 'students', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'Jamaica', 'still', 'Olivier', 'rather', 'dark', 'makeup', 'even', 'warn', 'beforehand', 'production', '60s', 'used', 'be', 'common', 'English', 'actors', 'play', 'Othello', 'greasepaint', 'more', 'recent', 'ones', 'have', 'dealt', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'Moor', 'race', 'black', 'relative', 'not', 'making', 'black', 'African', 'Moor', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'Libya', 'Barbary', 'Coast', 'Desdemona', 'old', 'servant', 'Barbary', 'students', 'also', 'laugh', 'Olivier', 'overacting', 'try', 'explain', 'away', 'telling', 'was', 'playing', 'role', 'stage', 'same', 'time', 'made', 'movie', 'forgot', 'tone', 'down', 'acting', 'when', 'got', 'front', 'cameras', 'Recently', 'however', 'had', 'student', 'who', 'thought', 'everything', 'Olivier', 'logical', 'based', 'text', 'course', 'right', 'way', 'end', 'though', 'most', 'students', 'prefer', 'version', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'agree', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'none', 'other', 'versions', 'are', 'either', 'Olivier', 'Othello', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'role', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'classic', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'second', 'best', 'Iago', 'Micheal', 'MacLaimmoir', 'excellent', 'Desdemona', 'Suzanne', 'Cloutier', '.Of', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'perhaps', 'most', 'perfect', 'whole', 'cast', 'Frank', 'Finlay', 'Iago', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'Iago', 'film', 'video', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'better', 'Ian', 'Mckellen', 'excellent', 'BBC', 'production', 'directed', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', '1989', 'TV', 'version', 'also', 'most', 'intellegent', 'choice', 'Desdemona', 'Imogen', 'Stubbs', 'really', 'part', 'probably', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'falls', 'love', 'marries', 'Moor', 'However', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'passable', 'here', 'Olivier', 'Desi', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'certainly', 'good', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Cassio', 'Joyce', 'Redman', 'outstanding', 'passionate', 'Emilia.The', 'other', 'versions', 'like', 'include', 'Orson', 'Wells', '1952', 'movie', 'version', '1989', 'BBC', 'production', 'mentioned', '1981', 'BBC', 'production', 'directed', 'Colin', 'Lowrey', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hopkins', 'very', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'exact', 'antithesis', 'Olivier', 'well-done', 'think', 'even', 'sometimes', '1995', 'movie', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'perhaps', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'others']",Othello VHS

399207,AS27SJQFMATT8,6304071825,Shakespeare,"[3, 7]","I had the great fortune to see the Olivier ""Othello"" twice at the Old Vic, once seated middle stalls, once seated in first row mezzanine. It was titanic . . . mythic, poetic, incredibly athletic, primal. Every muscle of his legs, arms and chest suggested a huge prowling panther; his feet were the paws of a great clawed cat, an uncaged magnificent wild beast moving over a savannah. There is nothing in Shakespearean stage history to equal the emotional physicality, operatic scope and Olympian power of Olivier's stage performance. I saw it happen not once, but twice: absolutely Himalayan each time, different each time. Nothing but legendary, thrilling Grand Opera performances by the likes of Chaliapin or Olivero match Olivier's display of ""fire from heaven.""As Ian McKellen does today with his world tour of ""King Lear,"" Olivier alternated ""Othello"" with Chekov ""comedy,"" in his case ""Uncle Vanya"" with Michael Redgrave, Joan Plowright, Max Adrian, etc.The most important thing to realize about this film, therefore, is that it in no way captures the actual theatrical experience which set the stage aflame in London and St. Petersburg in 1964. The camera is always too close. Always. Olivier in general, and his ""Othello"" in particular, needed to be seen on a stage at a distance of at least 30 feet to get the full scope and power of what he did. This filming is utterly unfair. We need many, many more sustained long shots; we need to see his legs and feet as he prowls, which is half the characterization; we need the resonance of a huge theater to get the operatic oratory Shakespeare composed for Burbage. Othello on stage is not spoken: he is sung. Just study the text. Listen to Verdi's incomparable ""Otello."" There is not one minute in this film that is fair or representative of what Olivier actually achieved theatrically. Yes, many of the gestures, the blocking, the delivery of lines are techniques he employed in his performance. His ""tricks."" But we see them from too close a vantage. They seem overdone, ham, over the top -- precisely because his interpretation and performance are scaled for an arena, not a camera.I have never understood why he approved the release of this film. Of all classical actors, Olivier knew the necessity to scale back, reinterpret and nuance a close-up filming of his acting. Remember Archie Rice? Why he didn't insist on distance and long shots, given the nature of his interpretation of Othello, is inexplicable. It is the worst disaster in filming a great stage performance that has ever been released. It requires alert and constant memory of his performances to ""know what he was doing"" as I watch the film. I have shared it with students of Shakespeare for years, and none of them sees what I KNOW is or was there. My memory is a far, far more honest representation of Olivier's characterization of Othello than can be seen in this film. I'm embarrassed by it, to the point of listening to the full length recording put out at the time rather than watching this desecration of arguably the most fiery, extraordinary physical stage performance of the 20th Century.All this said, however, TRY to see through the film to the performances. Piece out his imperfection with your thoughts. Use your imagination. Watch it as if at a distance. Add the torso, legs and especially the feet. Release his arms, gestures and faces from the screen into an arena. To watch this film and even comprehend it, let alone enjoy it, you simply must use your active imagination. If you have not been to great theater and opera all your life, you are going to have a tough time telling what the universal international acclaim is about. The only performance of a Shakespearean tragic hero that is comparable these days is McKellen's world tour of ""King Lear."" But there again, you have to be there in the theater to get it - at $3000 a ticket on the scalper's market. The DVD he will put out will not be the performance he is giving 160 times this year. He will never make the same mistake Olivier did, and try to ""capture"" the scope of his theatricality on film. Unlike Olivier, who was less than ordinarily intelligent, McKellen is a man with a mind who knows we expect Gandalf Redux at the movies. He will reinterpret, scale down, look for an entirely new vocabulary of gestures, looks, and vocal powers that match the medium. We who miss his stage performance miss his Lear - even if we get a truly wonderful DVD with Ian McKellen as Lear when the tour ends. Incidentally, Olivier failed continually in attempts at ""King Lear,"" whom he finally interpreted for DVD (in his dotage and his own words) as ""just an old fart.""Incidentally and in closing, the VHS and DVD release have been significantly altered by pan-and-scan from the original filming. The original film was shown at the National Theater in London, and though the vantage was far too close, there was indeed more widescreen and distance. I was at least satisfied after seeing the original film on the large screen in a great theater, even with its faults. But what we have in the video and DVD release is unconscionable. See if you don't agree, after watching this ruined treasure, that Frank Finlay's Iago is much more effective and real than Olivier's Othello. Then reflect that on stage together, Finlay was totally eclipsed, to the point where he received uniformly poor reviews for his ""colorless acting."" It's all a question of the medium. Live theater can be filmed perhaps, but never captured - especially as in this case where it films a proud and fearsome panther ranging over hundreds of miles as the actor walks dozens of feet.",5,Realize This Is A Film Of A Stage Performance,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,5640,"['had', 'great', 'fortune', 'see', 'Olivier', 'Othello', 'twice', 'Old', 'Vic', 'once', 'seated', 'middle',

399210,A277UC8WJVAIIE,6304071825,The Wiz,"[2, 2]","Laurence Olivier's 1965 screen adaptation of Othello depicts the decline and fall of a great military leader as he's driven insane with jealousy through deceit and manipulation eventually destroying his one, true love as the object of his unjust vengeance.  Watching Olivier literally become Othello the Moor is almost magical and even more striking when you watch the very brief introduction included as bonus material.  What really makes this movie stand out for me are the sets and close-ups; whereas the first are minimalist and visually haunting, the latter, best exemplified by the soliloquies of Othello and Iago, are strikingly iconic.  I'll go a bit further in suggesting that you can even turn the sound down on this one and just leave it playing on your television in the background and it's like a magnificent painting worthy of the finest art gallery.Unlike Olivier's Hamlet, the supporting cast for Othello is equally brilliant with specific emphasis on the role of Iago.  Frank Finlay is absolutely mesmerizing as he radiates contempt and deceit in a role that is traditionally antagonistic to the lead, as well as every other part for that matter.  Yes, he's a villain but Finlay's performance is a pleasure to watch making you understand why virtually every character in the play could be so altogether duped by his devious duplicity.  Maggie Smith as Desdemona may not be the extraordinary beauty that she is repeatedly accused of, however her performance is absolutely convincing as a paragon of virtue, the most loyal, sweet and devoted Christian maiden and spouse that a medieval nobleman could have asked for which makes this play all the more tragic as Othello becomes convinced, thanks to Iago's continual whispering, of her unfaithfulness.  Derek Jacobi is one of my all-time favorite actors period, and I love seeing him in a role when he's so young and vibrant playing the part of Cassio and the third victim in Iago's love-triangle scheme.  Othello is more than a brilliant tactician but a dangerous and deadly warrior in his own right and everyone seems to either fear or respect him or both with the exception of the fiery Emilia, played by Joyce Redman, who ironically is unjustly accused by her husband Iago of having an adulterous relation with the Moor.I think it's unfortunate that so many reviews of this excellent film tend to zero in on the single fact that a white man was portraying a black man which strikes me as a rather shallow, emotional reaction reflecting an almost stalinesque paranoia regarding anything that might be interpreted as racially offensive.  It's absolutely ridiculous to assume that one of the greatest stage and screen actors of the 20th century couldn't play a part outside of his own ethnicity; of course he could and how Olivier arrived at his particular interpretation of Othello is irrelevant but rather a testament to his genius as well as his insight and, in my opinion, the authenticity of the makeup is ""neither here nor there"".  Anyway, great film and please don't be turned off by PC motivated criticisms, just take it for what it is; an exceptional Shakespearean performance by an actor with greater insight into these plays than possibly any other of modern times.  :o)",5,The Othello I think Shakespeare Would've Loved,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,3245,"['Laurence', 'Olivier', '1965', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Othello', 'decline', 'fall', 'great', 'military', 'leader', 'driven', 'insane', 'jealousy', 'deceit', 'manipulation', 'eventually', 'destroying', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'object', 'unjust', 'vengeance', 'Watching', 'Olivier', 'literally', 'become', 'Othello', 'Moor', 'almost', 'magical', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'when', 'watch', 'very', 'brief', 'introduction', 'included', 'bonus', 'material', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'sets', 'close-ups', 'first', 'are', 'minimalist', 'visually', 'haunting', 'latter', 'best', 'exemplified', 'soliloquies', 'Othello', 'Iago', 'are', 'strikingly', 'iconic', ""'ll"", 'go', 'bit', 'further', 'suggesting', 'can', 'even', 'turn', 'sound', 'down', 'one', 'just', 'leave', 'playing', 'television', 'background', 'magnificent', 'painting', 'worthy', 'finest', 'art', 'gallery.Unlike', 'Olivier', 'Hamlet', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Othello', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'specific', 'emphasis', 'role', 'Iago', 'Frank', 'Finlay', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'contempt', 'deceit', 'role', 'traditionally', 'antagonistic', 'lead', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'part', 'matter', 'Yes', 'villain', 'Finlay', 'performance', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'making', 'understand', 'why', 'virtually', 'character', 'play', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'altogether', 'duped', 'devious', 'duplicity', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Desdemona', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'repeatedly', 'accused', 'however', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'paragon', 'virtue', 'most', 'loyal', 'sweet', 'devoted', 'Christian', 'maiden', 'spouse', 'medieval', 'nobleman', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'play', 'more', 'tragic', 'Othello', 'convinced', 'thanks', 'Iago', 'continual', 'whispering', 'unfaithfulness', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'period', 'love', 'seeing', 'role', 'when', 'so', 'young', 'vibrant', 'playing', 'part', 'Cassio', 'third', 'victim', 'Iago', 'love-triangle', 'scheme', 'Othello', 'more', 'brilliant', 'tactician', 'dangerous', 'deadly', 'warrior', 'own', 'right', 'everyone', 'fear', 'respect', 'exception', 'fiery', 'Emilia', 'played', 'Joyce', 'Redman', 'who', 'ironically', 'unjustly', 'accused', 'husband', 'Iago', 'having', 'adulterous', 'relation', 'Moor.I', 'think', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'excellent', 'film', 'tend', 'zero', 'single', 'fact', 'white', 'man', 'was', 'portraying', 'black', 'man', 'rather', 'shallow', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'reflecting', 'almost', 'stalinesque', 'paranoia', 'regarding', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'interpreted', 'racially', 'offensive', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'assume', 'one', 'greatest', 'stage', 'screen', 'actors', '20th', 'century', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'part', 'own', 'ethnicity', 'course', 'could', 'how', 'Olivier', 'arrived', 'particular', 'interpretation', 'Othello', 'irrelevant', 'rather', 'testament', 'genius', 'as', 'well', 'insight', 'opinion', 'authenticity', 'makeup', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'Anyway', 'great', 'film', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'PC', 'motivated', 'criticisms', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'exceptional', 'Shakespearean', 'performance', 'actor', 'greater', 'insight', 'plays', 'possibly', 'other', 'modern', 'times', 'o']",Othello VHS
