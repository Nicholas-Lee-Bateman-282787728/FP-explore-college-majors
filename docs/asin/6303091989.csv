355395,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303091989,Acute Observer,"[0, 14]","The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 1970 filmThe copyright for Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional characters expired before this film was produced so anyone can appropriate his characters today. None who do this are as good as the original four long stories and fifty-six short stories (which reflect life in those passed times). This parody is not as good as the low-budget movies of the 1930s and 1940s. The part spent at the opera can be omitted without affecting the rest of this story. It applies an outlook that did not exist then, and denies these stories about the beginnings of criminalistics and their effect upon later fiction. We know people in show business do not lead normal lives. Those who pretend to be characters on stage may suffer psychic damage and seek drink or drugs in relief. The first false note is showing a dusty manuscript. If it was kept in a sealed box where did that dust come from?In August 1887 Holmes and Watson return to London. There is some comic situations. Holmes complains about a lack of action (and fees), and reaches for his small bottle. They receive an invitation to an opera; this is followed by some ""funny"" skits. It does show how gossip is spread by the expressions on faces. People believe what they want to believe when it belittles someone else. That is the appeal of gossip. [""Thou shalt not bear false witness.""] ""Goodnight, Watson."" The doorbell rings, a young lady is brought in. They accept delivery of this package. ""I don't know."" Who is Gabrielle? Holmes traced her luggage ticket and found her name and valise. Her husband is missing! Holmes sends a letter to 32 Ashdown Street, an empty shop. Who will take the letter? Who is buying a dozen canaries? Mycroft tells Sherlock to drop his investigation. [Official Secrets?] Holmes has a plan to drop any tail. Why does Gabrielle open her parasol indoors? [Bad luck?] They travel to Inverness in Scotland. A picnic in a cemetery? Did Watson see a monster in a lake? There are mysterious events. What are Trappist monks doing in Protestant Scotland? They travel around the country lanes on bicycles. [The great bicycle craze of the 1880s inspired the invention of the automobile.] They visit a castle undergoing restoration; it is closed to the public.On the lake Holmes hears the rattle of machinery. [Sound carries farther in water.] Their boat is upset, yet they all survive in that cold water. Holmes speculates about a mechanical monster. Where will they go next? Mycroft visits Sherlock and talks about ""submersibles"". Madame Valladon is really an agent of Wilhelmstrasse! [The street in Berlin where the German Secret Service is headquartered.] Queen Victoria arrives after dark to view the `Jonah'. That craft is not sporting and un-English. Would her grandson Willie ever bomb London? [Yes.] This project is cancelled, but Mycroft has a plan to let no crisis go to waste. Fraulein von Hofmann-Stahl is awakened. ""Unter den Schloss?"" She will be useful in a trade. And so the story ends. ""Auf wiedersehn."" Later a letter reaches Sherlock in London with sad news about Ilse. The Kempei-Tai are not easily fooled. Sherlock reaches for his little bottle.It seems that writers without great talent will try to tear down a fictional character because they cannot produce a better product. There were ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies in the 1930s and 1940s, and a TV series in the 1950s. Tastes and expectations change. Hammett, Gardner, and Chandler were popular in the past but are no longer being published. Nowadays people watch television, but you learn little (compared to the novels of Hammett or Gardner).",2,A Fantastic Counterfeit,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,3613,"['Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '1970', 'filmThe', 'copyright', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'fictional', 'characters', 'expired', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'so', 'anyone', 'can', 'appropriate', 'characters', 'today', 'None', 'who', 'do', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'four', 'long', 'stories', 'fifty-six', 'short', 'stories', 'reflect', 'life', 'passed', 'times', 'parody', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'low-budget', 'movies', '1930s', '1940s', 'part', 'spent', 'opera', 'can', 'be', 'omitted', 'affecting', 'rest', 'story', 'outlook', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'then', 'stories', 'beginnings', 'criminalistics', 'effect', 'later', 'fiction', 'know', 'people', 'show', 'business', 'do', 'not', 'lead', 'normal', 'lives', 'who', 'pretend', 'be', 'characters', 'stage', 'may', 'suffer', 'psychic', 'damage', 'seek', 'drink', 'drugs', 'relief', 'first', 'false', 'note', 'showing', 'dusty', 'manuscript', 'was', 'kept', 'sealed', 'box', 'where', 'did', 'dust', 'come', 'August', '1887', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'return', 'London', 'comic', 'situations', 'Holmes', 'lack', 'action', 'fees', 'reaches', 'small', 'bottle', 'receive', 'invitation', 'opera', 'followed', 'funny', 'skits', 'show', 'how', 'gossip', 'spread', 'expressions', 'People', 'believe', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'appeal', 'gossip', '[', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'bear', 'false', 'witness', 'Goodnight', 'Watson', 'doorbell', 'rings', 'young', 'lady', 'brought', 'accept', 'delivery', 'package', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Who', 'Gabrielle', 'Holmes', 'traced', 'luggage', 'ticket', 'found', 'name', 'valise', 'husband', 'missing', 'Holmes', 'letter', '32', 'Ashdown', 'Street', 'empty', 'shop', 'Who', 'will', 'take', 'letter', 'Who', 'buying', 'dozen', 'canaries', 'Mycroft', 'Sherlock', 'drop', 'investigation', 'Official', 'Secrets', ']', 'Holmes', 'plan', 'drop', 'tail', 'Why', 'Gabrielle', 'open', 'parasol', 'indoors', '[', 'Bad', 'luck', 'travel', 'Inverness', 'Scotland', 'picnic', 'cemetery', 'Did', 'Watson', 'see', 'monster', 'lake', 'are', 'mysterious', 'events', 'What', 'are', 'Trappist', 'monks', 'doing', 'Protestant', 'Scotland', 'travel', 'country', 'bicycles', '[', 'great', 'bicycle', 'craze', '1880s', 'inspired', 'invention', 'automobile', 'visit', 'castle', 'undergoing', 'restoration', 'closed', 'public.On', 'lake', 'Holmes', 'rattle', 'machinery', 'Sound', 'farther', 'water', ']', 'boat', 'upset', 'yet', 'survive', 'cold', 'water', 'Holmes', 'mechanical', 'monster', 'Where', 'will', 'go', 'next', 'Mycroft', 'Sherlock', 'talks', 'submersibles', 'Madame', 'Valladon', 'really', 'agent', 'Wilhelmstrasse', 'street', 'Berlin', 'where', 'German', 'Secret', 'Service', 'headquartered', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'arrives', 'dark', 'view', 'Jonah', 'craft', 'not', 'sporting', 'un-English', 'Would', 'grandson', 'Willie', 'ever', 'bomb', 'London', '[', 'Yes', ']', 'project', 'cancelled', 'Mycroft', 'plan', 'let', 'crisis', 'go', 'waste', 'Fraulein', 'von', 'Hofmann-Stahl', 'awakened', 'Unter', 'den', 'Schloss', 'will', 'be', 'useful', 'trade', 'so', 'story', 'Auf', 'wiedersehn', 'Later', 'letter', 'Sherlock', 'London', 'sad', 'news', 'Ilse', 'Kempei-Tai', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'fooled', 'Sherlock', 'little', 'bottle.It', 'writers', 'great', 'talent', 'will', 'try', 'tear', 'down', 'fictional', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'produce', 'better', 'product', 'were', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'movies', '1930s', '1940s', 'TV', 'series', '1950s', 'Tastes', 'expectations', 'change', 'Hammett', 'Gardner', 'Chandler', 'were', 'popular', 'past', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'published', 'Nowadays', 'people', 'watch', 'television', 'learn', 'little', 'compared', 'novels', 'Hammett', 'Gardner']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

What shocks me the most about this particular one is that Billy Wilder actually wrote the screenplay and directed it. I really expect more from him in this one and think he could have actually read the original stories and then give the characters the justice they deserve. But no, one mere buffoonery from ""Dr."" Watson ruins the film. The whole film founders from there. Moreover, I hate this new character sketch in Mycroft Holmes. It won't ever happen. He was corpulent, and he trusted his brother in all matters. Finally, there is no way in hell that Sherlock Holmes would be hoodwinked. In fact, he would have figured it out within a day by the usual Holmesian routine via checking the sources out through the news channel and produce photographs of the couple for verification purposes. He actually never bothers using his techniques for any scene and just strolls along, observing from a distance. That's when I knew the film died. The way Watson treated Sherlock Holmes is appalling and unacceptable. Not once it happens in the stories. And if it did occur, Holmes would never stand for it for a second. He always had a command in every situation and of everybody's respect at all times. Watson in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes should have shut the hell up or be thrown in the Thames River. The mystery of the story sucks and is not up to par with other Sherlock's cases. He would have stayed home and sent Watson on the trip to check some facts out for him. On the other hand, Robert Stephens does a great job of playing Sherlock Holmes, and it is a pretty good portrayal of him. All in all, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, even for a Billy Wilder film, is a disappointment and makes a serious case for discrimination against homosexuals.",2,I Expected More from Billy Wilder.,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1899,"['Viewed', '4/13Rate', '34/13', 'Add', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'long', 'disappointing', 'list', 'failed', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'ever', 'made', 'What', 'most', 'particular', 'one', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'actually', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'really', 'expect', 'more', 'one', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'read', 'original', 'stories', 'then', 'give', 'characters', 'justice', 'deserve', 'one', 'mere', 'buffoonery', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'film', 'whole', 'film', 'founders', 'there', 'Moreover', 'hate', 'new', 'character', 'sketch', 'Mycroft', 'Holmes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'happen', 'was', 'corpulent', 'trusted', 'brother', 'matters', 'Finally', 'way', 'hell', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'would', 'be', 'hoodwinked', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'day', 'usual', 'Holmesian', 'routine', 'checking', 'sources', 'out', 'news', 'channel', 'produce', 'photographs', 'couple', 'verification', 'purposes', 'actually', 'never', 'bothers', 'using', 'techniques', 'scene', 'just', 'strolls', 'along', 'observing', 'distance', 'when', 'knew', 'film', 'died', 'way', 'Watson', 'treated', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'appalling', 'unacceptable', 'Not', 'stories', 'did', 'occur', 'Holmes', 'would', 'never', 'stand', 'second', 'always', 'had', 'command', 'situation', 'everybody', 'respect', 'times', 'Watson', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'should', 'have', 'shut', 'hell', 'up', 'be', 'thrown', 'Thames', 'River', 'mystery', 'story', 'sucks', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'Sherlock', 'cases', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'sent', 'Watson', 'trip', 'check', 'facts', 'out', 'other', 'hand', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'pretty', 'good', 'portrayal', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'even', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'film', 'disappointment', 'serious', 'case', 'discrimination', 'homosexuals']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

355402,A2F2579KSL24DU,6303091989,"Avie L. Hern ""Sage on the Hudson""","[10, 12]","THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is often called a ""comedy-drama""; it's not, no more than Billy Wilder's other great films -- DOUBLE INDEMINTY, THE LOST WEEKEND, ACE IN THE HOLE, SUNSET BOULEVARD, and the little-known FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO -- are. Like most of the scripts crafted by Wilder and his major writer-collaborators -- most notably, Charles Brackett, Raymond Chandler, and I.A.L. Diamond -- THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is simply a drama with trenchant humor that only serves to bring forth the sad, dark, bitter aspects of human nature which Wilder's work inevitably explores.Holmes afficionados generally disdain Wilder's film, partly because they think Wilder and Diamond are mocking their heroes -- which couldn't be further from the truth (imbuing Holmes with such biting wit only magnifies his brilliance), and also because, in the perplexing case that Wilder and Diamond have fashioned, Holmes is, ultimately, outwitted by his adversary.Even this statement is misleading, though. Holmes, to all intents and purposes, allows himself to be outwitted; indeed, he knows that he's allowing his personal feelings for a woman, of all things, to get in the way of his deductive reasoning, knows that this decision to pursue the case in the face of this inevitable defeat will ultimately breach the intellectual armour he's cultivated and fashioned over a lifetime in such a way that it can never be fully mended.That's why Watson failed to chronicle this particular adventure in the pages of the Strand Magazine, as he had the Great Detective's other cases: not merely because it was of ""a personal nature,"" but because of Watson's regard for the very feelings and humanity that Holmes has always taken such great pains to hide.It is rather ironic that the Baker Street Irregulars -- those most rabid of Holmes afficionados -- refuse to accept that the Great Detective is not flesh-and-blood, but merely the product of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fertile imagination, since they also reject Wilder and Diamond's view of him as fully human, complete with flaws, faults, and failings.  It's also a great pity, for in THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES they would at last meet their hero face to face.",5,"QUICK, WATSON, THE DVD IS AFOOT!",1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,2214,"['PRIVATE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'often', 'called', 'comedy-drama', 'not', 'more', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'DOUBLE', 'INDEMINTY', 'THE', 'LOST', 'WEEKEND', 'ACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'HOLE', 'SUNSET', 'BOULEVARD', 'little-known', 'FIVE', 'GRAVES', 'TO', 'CAIRO', 'are', 'most', 'scripts', 'crafted', 'Wilder', 'major', 'writer-collaborators', 'most', 'notably', 'Charles', 'Brackett', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'THE', 'PRIVATE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'simply', 'drama', 'trenchant', 'humor', 'only', 'bring', 'forth', 'sad', 'dark', 'bitter', 'aspects', 'human', 'nature', 'Wilder', 'work', 'inevitably', 'afficionados', 'generally', 'disdain', 'Wilder', 'film', 'partly', 'think', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'are', 'mocking', 'heroes', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'imbuing', 'Holmes', 'such', 'biting', 'wit', 'only', 'brilliance', 'also', 'perplexing', 'case', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'have', 'fashioned', 'Holmes', 'ultimately', 'outwitted', 'adversary.Even', 'statement', 'misleading', 'though', 'Holmes', 'intents', 'purposes', 'be', 'outwitted', 'indeed', 'allowing', 'personal', 'feelings', 'woman', 'things', 'get', 'way', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'decision', 'pursue', 'case', 'face', 'inevitable', 'defeat', 'will', 'ultimately', 'breach', 'intellectual', 'armour', 'cultivated', 'fashioned', 'lifetime', 'such', 'way', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'mended.That', 'why', 'Watson', 'failed', 'chronicle', 'particular', 'adventure', 'pages', 'Strand', 'Magazine', 'had', 'Great', 'Detective', 'other', 'cases', 'not', 'merely', 'was', 'personal', 'nature', 'Watson', 'regard', 'very', 'feelings', 'humanity', 'Holmes', 'always', 'taken', 'such', 'great', 'pains', 'hide.It', 'rather', 'ironic', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregulars', 'most', 'rabid', 'Holmes', 'afficionados', 'refuse', 'accept', 'Great', 'Detective', 'not', 'flesh-and-blood', 'merely', 'product', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'also', 'reject', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'view', 'fully', 'human', 'complete', 'flaws', 'faults', 'failings', 'also', 'great', 'pity', 'THE', 'PRIVATE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'would', 'last', 'meet', 'hero', 'face', 'face']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

With THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, director Billy Wilder takes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters and adds his own signature brand of humor in what was originally intended as an episodic road show picture. In its edited theatrical release, the structure and pacing become highly uneven between the first and second acts, although the strength of Wilder's script rarely falters as a result. Robert Stephens is simply brilliant as the famed detective, delivering plenty of dry wit and playful androgyny that set his performance apart from all others. Colin Blakely is equally enjoyable as Dr. John Watson, Holmes' excitable colleague who has turned an effeminate cocaine addict into a modern myth thanks to the somewhat fictionalized accounts that he has been submitting to The Strand periodical. Christopher Lee also appears in another dashing role as Holmes' elder brother Mycroft, who is shown to be of superior intellect and social standing despite his lack of celebrity.

Holmes is a favorite from childhood, and odd takeoffs on him are not appreciated. I have settled on the Jeremy Brett series as the definitive version (with an authentic Watson), but enjoy others that are well done. Usually, if you like the subject matter, you will probably like a good adaptation, if a bit more inventive than the source material. Another Holmes based example of that would be ""The Seven Percent Solution,"" which I thought was well done and true to character.  I haven't seen a lot of Robert Stephens, but have appreciated what I have. I looked him up and found that this was pretty light fare for his experience. His is a quality portrayal and really, so are most.However, the Dr. Watson persona mystifies, that here and in other handling, they make him something of a buffoon. That's not the author's character, nor what Holmes' temperament would seem to tolerate as a companion or assistant. Maybe it came from the early Rathbone series with Nigel Bruce's inaccurate portrayal of Watson as a bumbler. Whether intentional or not, the movies frequently present him as comic relief. The real Watson was an established medical practitioner, war veteran, gentlemanly, a man of disciplined habits and sobriety, who actually served as a steadying influence to Holmes on occasion. His counter posing traits and abilities served as assets to Holmes, such as his use of fire arms, medical knowledge, leg man and sensitivity to persons and situations where Holmes was limited or devoid - not a bizarre personality.  There was enough of that element in the storylines to satisfy that requirement.  By the way, his assistantship and housemate status ended upon his marriage.But, this overall production is pleasing and one that keeps Holmes' basic makeup well intact.",4,Not Really Messing With Holmes,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1884,"['fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'had', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'Holmes', 'persona', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Holmes', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'odd', 'takeoffs', 'are', 'not', 'appreciated', 'have', 'settled', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'series', 'definitive', 'version', 'authentic', 'Watson', 'others', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Usually', 'like', 'subject', 'matter', 'will', 'probably', 'good', 'adaptation', 'bit', 'more', 'inventive', 'source', 'material', 'Holmes', 'based', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Seven', 'Percent', 'Solution', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'character', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'have', 'appreciated', 'what', 'have', 'looked', 'up', 'found', 'was', 'pretty', 'light', 'fare', 'experience', 'quality', 'portrayal', 'really', 'so', 'are', 'most.However', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'persona', 'mystifies', 'here', 'other', 'handling', 'make', 'something', 'buffoon', 'not', 'author', 'character', 'what', 'Holmes', 'temperament', 'would', 'seem', 'tolerate', 'companion', 'assistant', 'Maybe', 'came', 'early', 'Rathbone', 'series', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'Watson', 'bumbler', 'Whether', 'intentional', 'not', 'movies', 'frequently', 'present', 'comic', 'relief', 'real', 'Watson', 'was', 'established', 'medical', 'practitioner', 'war', 'veteran', 'gentlemanly', 'man', 'disciplined', 'habits', 'sobriety', 'who', 'actually', 'served', 'steadying', 'influence', 'Holmes', 'occasion', 'counter', 'posing', 'traits', 'abilities', 'served', 'assets', 'Holmes', 'such', 'use', 'fire', 'arms', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'leg', 'man', 'sensitivity', 'persons', 'situations', 'where', 'Holmes', 'was', 'limited', 'devoid', 'not', 'bizarre', 'personality', 'was', 'enough', 'element', 'storylines', 'satisfy', 'requirement', 'way', 'assistantship', 'housemate', 'status', 'ended', 'marriage.But', 'overall', 'production', 'pleasing', 'one', 'Holmes', 'basic', 'makeup', 'well', 'intact']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

But Billy Wilder not only gave us the best of the post-Basil Rathbone movies about the Baker Street sleuth, he came close to making his best film ever. He might have succeeded but for the old story of studio interference. By all accounts, the film was originally intended to consist of four interwoven stories. But fears about excessive running time reduced that to two with one of them being more a diversion than a subplot. Even so, what remains is a thoroughly enjoyable experience filled with memorable performances, droll dialogue, atmospheric visuals and a brilliantly evocative musical score.Miklos Rozsa's music is an integral part of the film. Primarily a reworking of the composer's Violin Concerto, Wilder reportedly loved the music so much that he constructed entire sequences to fit the music, rather than the other way around. And what music it is. The melody for solo violin taken from the concerto's second movement - which might, in another film, be called the &quot;love theme&quot; - is among the best and most beautiful music Rozsa ever wrote and adds immeasurably to the film's style and feel.Even more important, of course, are the performances by Wilder's carefully assembled cast. As Sherlock Holmes, Robert Stephens is deliciously camp - even his makeup is more theatrical than cinematic. At first, he seems to be overdoing it, but it soon becomes apparent just how perfectly his performance suits - and dictates - the mood of the piece. Hardly a star name - Stephens was primarily a stage actor - it was probably a risk to cast him, but a risk that paid off with fantastic results. You will not forget Robert Stephen's Sherlock Holmes in a hurry.Not content with a dazzling lead performance, Wilder surrounds Stephens with a solid supporting cast. Colin Blakely is a perfect counterpoint as Watson - more exasperated than bumbling, full of a medical man's common sense. As the woman who comes into Holmes's life, Genevieve Page is even more ravishing than usual, yet always makes the various shifts in her character totally believable. Christopher Lee cuts an imposing figure as Sherlock's smarter brother Mycroft, while the great Irene Handl fusses and sighs effectively as Holmes's landlady Mrs Hudson. Clive Revill provides a comic Russian while Stanley Holloway pops up as a gravedigger (just as he did in Olivier's Hamlet).The complicated plot, which takes Holmes from London to Loch Ness, not only provides him the opportunity to (possibly) fall in love but also manages to squeeze in Russian ballerinas, German spies, circus dwarfs, trappist monks, Queen Victoria, an early submarine, and a certain Scottish monster. It's a hard film to take seriously but, luckily, Wilder obviously had no intention of being overly serious. Conan Doyle purists will no doubt find much in the film to shake their heads about. But lovers of imaginative and witty films will revel in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.",5,Billy Wilder's Almost Masterpiece,1026172800,"07 9, 2002",2002,3047,"['maker', 'Apartment', 'Hot', 'film', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'might', 'seem', 'strange', 'project', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'not', 'only', 'gave', 'best', 'post-Basil', 'Rathbone', 'movies', 'Baker', 'Street', 'sleuth', 'came', 'close', 'making', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'might', 'have', 'succeeded', 'old', 'story', 'studio', 'interference', 'accounts', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'consist', 'four', 'interwoven', 'stories', 'excessive', 'running', 'time', 'reduced', 'two', 'one', 'being', 'more', 'diversion', 'subplot', 'Even', 'so', 'what', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'filled', 'memorable', 'performances', 'droll', 'dialogue', 'atmospheric', 'visuals', 'brilliantly', 'evocative', 'musical', 'score.Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'music', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'Primarily', 'reworking', 'composer', 'Violin', 'Concerto', 'Wilder', 'reportedly', 'loved', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'constructed', 'entire', 'sequences', 'fit', 'music', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'what', 'music', 'melody', 'solo', 'violin', 'taken', 'concerto', 'second', 'movement', 'might', 'film', 'be', 'called', 'quot', 'theme', 'quot', 'best', 'most', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Rozsa', 'ever', 'wrote', 'immeasurably', 'film', 'style', 'feel.Even', 'more', 'important', 'course', 'are', 'performances', 'Wilder', 'carefully', 'assembled', 'cast', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'deliciously', 'camp', 'even', 'makeup', 'more', 'theatrical', 'cinematic', 'first', 'be', 'overdoing', 'soon', 'apparent', 'just', 'how', 'perfectly', 'performance', 'suits', 'mood', 'piece', 'Hardly', 'star', 'name', 'Stephens', 'was', 'primarily', 'stage', 'actor', 'was', 'probably', 'risk', 'cast', 'risk', 'paid', 'off', 'fantastic', 'results', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'Robert', 'Stephen', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'hurry.Not', 'content', 'dazzling', 'lead', 'performance', 'Wilder', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Colin', 'Blakely', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'Watson', 'more', 'exasperated', 'bumbling', 'full', 'medical', 'man', 'common', 'sense', 'woman', 'who', 'Holmes', 'life', 'Genevieve', 'Page', 'even', 'more', 'ravishing', 'usual', 'yet', 'always', 'various', 'shifts', 'character', 'totally', 'believable', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'imposing', 'figure', 'Sherlock', 'smarter', 'brother', 'Mycroft', 'great', 'Irene', 'Handl', 'fusses', 'sighs', 'effectively', 'Holmes', 'landlady', 'Mrs', 'Hudson', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'comic', 'Russian', 'Stanley', 'Holloway', 'up', 'gravedigger', 'just', 'did', 'Olivier', 'Hamlet', '.The', 'complicated', 'plot', 'Holmes', 'London', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'not', 'only', 'opportunity', 'possibly', 'fall', 'love', 'also', 'squeeze', 'Russian', 'ballerinas', 'German', 'spies', 'circus', 'dwarfs', 'trappist', 'monks', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'early', 'submarine', 'certain', 'Scottish', 'monster', 'hard', 'film', 'take', 'seriously', 'luckily', 'Wilder', 'obviously', 'had', 'intention', 'being', 'overly', 'serious', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'purists', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'much', 'film', 'shake', 'heads', 'lovers', 'imaginative', 'witty', 'films', 'will', 'revel', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

Wilder takes the mythic, universal Holmes, and returns him to his origins in the fin de siecle 1880s and 90s, the period of Messrs. Jekyll, Hyde and Gray.  Like these, and most Wilde heroes, Holmes is a split personality, damagingly torn between the obligationss of his reputation, and his personal desires.

The opening of the case containing Holmes is mirrored by the later opening of a coffin, containing the man Holmes is impersonating.Played like a Wildean tragicomedy, the film also shows, in this celebration of the archetypal reasoner, the roots of the 20th century's barbarous anti-reason - the Boer War victims, Mycroft's scientific militarism, and the burial of the midgets all point to the two World Wars and concentration camps to come.",5,Far and away Wilder's masterpiece.,985132800,"03 21, 2001",2001,1002,"['Case', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'appropriately', 'case', 'containing', 'familiar', 'signifiers', 'great', 'detective', 'Wilder', 'mythic', 'universal', 'Holmes', 'origins', 'fin', 'siecle', '1880s', '90s', 'period', 'Messrs.', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'Gray', 'most', 'Wilde', 'heroes', 'Holmes', 'split', 'personality', 'damagingly', 'torn', 'obligationss', 'reputation', 'personal', 'desires', 'inability', 'be', 'man', 'desiring', 'body', 'ghost', 'present', 'world', 'men', 'unable', 'partake', 'opening', 'case', 'containing', 'Holmes', 'mirrored', 'later', 'opening', 'coffin', 'containing', 'man', 'Holmes', 'impersonating.Played', 'Wildean', 'tragicomedy', 'film', 'also', 'celebration', 'archetypal', 'reasoner', 'roots', '20th', 'century', 'barbarous', 'anti-reason', 'Boer', 'War', 'victims', 'Mycroft', 'scientific', 'militarism', 'burial', 'midgets', 'point', 'two', 'World', 'Wars', 'concentration', 'camps', 'come']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS

I do like the rapid-fire wit that Holmes seems to have here (a bit more in abundance than in the canonical Conan Doyle stories), but the Holmes presented here is a bit more dark and brooding, more akin to the extra-canonical 'Seven Percent Solution' Holmes in many ways.Wilder was an extraordinary director and genius who sometimes gets carried away with his subject (in this regard, he is sometimes compared with Stanley Kubrick). His films are often of epic-proportions, even though they are not essentially 'epic' subjects. This film is reputed to have been nearly twice as long as the final cut version, but this may be apocryphal in that much of the raw footage never made it to final print and production. The restoration available on the disc currently available is, in fact, rather minimal - a few scenes and a few extras, but not much more than the original release of the film. This is disappointing to many fans, but in fact is more than most of us have had for a long time, as the somewhat choppy film was often mercilessly cut for television broadcast.Holmes in this case is played by Robert Stephens, an unlikely Holmes in comparison to standards such as Rathbone, Brett, or Gillette, but still an interesting choice - quintessentially British, reserved but daring, brilliant yet flawed and faltering. Colin Blakely presents a stronger Watson than often portrayed before (this film, being made in 1970, presented this as a newer idea for Watson, one that has been picked up by many subsequent productions). Wilder has the actors play at various issues of Victorian sensibility and morality, including the implication (dismissed in the end) that Holmes might have a sexual identity issue. Christopher Lee, who himself plays Holmes in other productions, plays Holmes' smarter brother Mycroft here, to good effect.The story line does have some inspiration from the canonical stories (the Bruce-Partington Plans, for one), and from Gillette's play (the strange case of Miss Faulkner, introducing an ending that allowed for a love interest for Holmes in the end), but for the most part takes the characters from Conan Doyle and runs far afield.

355441,A2FKG4H4O9WFIY,6303091989,George Hatch,"[21, 26]","Let me preface this with the introduction to the ""Deleted Scenes"" extra on the disc because it describes the film as Wilder had intended:""The original screenplay as described by Billy Wilder was a symphony in four movements. Following a modern day prologue (represented here in still photos and script pages) the intent was to illustrate four stories that Dr. Watson optednot to have published in the 'Strand Magazine'.""Wilder wanted to explain Holmes' distrust of women, his drug addiction, his relationship with Dr. Watson; and, at the same time reveal Holmes' human side. The completed version would run approximately three hours, including an intermission. Upon its release in 1970, Wilder's symphony was presented with only two of its four movements.""Two biographies I've read confirm that Wilder cried openly when he saw the final product.This Deleted Scenes section is most intriguing as it meticulously reconstructs as much as possible the four ""movements"" of Wilder's ""symphony"" which are titled: ""Original Prologue"" (including an appearance by 'Dr. Watson' circa 1970), ""The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room"", ""The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective/Holmes Recounts an Affair of the Past"" and finally ""The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners"".  As mentioned above, still photos and script pages were used -  and a lot of actual filmed footage which is presented with subtitles because the soundtrack could not be located. Taking all of this into consideration, I'm not all that sure that the three-hour version would have worked; and the final cut released by the studio is something of a disappointment.The opening scene nicely introduces a somewhat different interpretation of the main characters, with Holmes complaining that Watson is always exaggerating his exploits and putting words into his mouth; and diluting his ""seven-percent solution"" of morphine to five. Then they're off to the final performance of Petrova in The Russian Ballet, after which Rogozgin (Clive Revill),  Petrova's manager advises that she's retiring.""She's been dancing since she was three-years-old...now she is thirty-eight.""""I must say, she doesn't look thirty-eight!""""That's because she is forty-nine.""(And that, unfortunately, is one of a mere handful of jokes in the screenplay.)Petrova also wants to have a ""beautiful and brilliant child""; she has the beauty, and Holmes has the brains. But something's afoot! This extended 20-minute scene is meant to confirm Holmes' homosexuality and deny that the heterosexual Watson has been his secret lover. The problem is that it doesn't have anything to do with the basic plot, which doesn't kick in for a full thirty minutes. It may have ""balanced"" Wilder's symphony concept, but out of that context it's totally extraneous.And by comparison to Arthur Conan Doyle's plots, this one is pretty skimpy.  It was probably intended as a simple framework to hold your interest while the deleted scenes were to enlighten you about the ""private life"" elements. This also makes the title of the film misleading. I won't go into the details of the plot or bring up any spoilers for those who want to see it, except to say that it is shamefully simplistic.The acting is topnotch all around and Robert Stevens makes an excellent Holmes, though Colin Blakeley's Watson is sometimes too blustery and exasperated; at times you almost expect to hear that ""blowing-off-steam-whistle"" sound affect associated with Lou Costello and Oliver Hardy. Christopher Lee as Holmes' brother, Mycroft, steals the few scenes he's in.He also provides and interesting extra titled ""Christopher Lee: Mr. Holmes, Mr. Wilder"" in which he recalls a few behind-the-scenes tales of working with Wilder (whom he greatly admires), and brief overview of the Holmes legend, some of which was seen on the ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" DVD released last year. This is followed by a 30-minute interview Ernest Walker, the film's editor who provides some interesting information on  meeting and working with Wilder. There's also the usual Photo Gallery and Trailer.The best part of the film is the beautifully poignant score by Miklos Rozsa, which I wish had been offered as an isolated track. The cinematography is by Christopher Challis (""Sink the Bismarck!"", ""Two for the Road"", ""Arabesque"", ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"") - but it's hard to judge his contribution because of the poor quality of the transfer. It looks washed out with dull colors; and several transition scenes (probably reel ends) take on a fogged-up appearance, though not one suggesting a London ""shroud"". In fact, the film itself isn't much better that the found footage used for the reconstructed scenes. This is surprising coming from MGM whose ""Women in Love"" DVD is spectacularly lush. For that matter, so are the transfers in their Midnite Movie series. It may have been the original ""Private Life..."" film stock; but most of the Midnight Movies are cheap exploitation and horror films and I find it hard to believe that, say, Roger Corman, had better film than Wilder.I must be in the minority because on imdb, ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" has a rating of 7.3 rating (with over 500 votes; and  hereAmazon 22 reviews averages a 4  out of

And while I appreciate his choices I am annoyed with the fact that they are not featured as extras on this DVD. I'm not exactly sure what the deleted scenes (or should that be plots) are but I can't shake the feeling that the first 30 minutes are completely redundant in relation to the rest of the movie and perhaps it might not have been if the movie were longer. Cutting a movie down to size is always a very tough thing to do. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes suffers, but still manages to be entertaining.Complaints aside, I really do enjoy Wilder's bizarre approach to Sherlock Holmes. Robert Stephens plays him with more a touch more humor and pathos than most other actors and comes across as a mix between Alan Rickman and Rick Mayall. It's definitely the most pleasant I've seen Holmes. The mystery he gets involved in may be huge, though it's not exactly exciting. Wilder seems more interested in having every element of the story fall into place than give us something with a sense of urgency. And for a film over 2 hours long (it was meant to be 3) it's not cool to have every scene presented at its own pace. There has to be some compromise.The photography is excellent. The 2.35:1 widescreen frame is used expertly and one can only imagine the horrors of this film being presented in pan and scan. The anamorphic picture looks fine for a 33 year old film and the Mono sound is completely adeqequate.

The film is ostensibly a report on a case that Sherlock mishandled; he did not understand what was happening. Underlying the tale and the first scene is the question of whether Sherlock is gay, as he claimed to avoid hurting the ballerina's feelings.An attractive woman is carried to Holmes' apartment by a cabbie because he found Holmes' address in the woman's pocket. He said that he found her floating in the water. Although she was at first unable to recall her name, why she wanted to see Holmes, and why she was in the water, her memory returned. She said that she sought Holmes' help in finding her husband, and while coming to see him, someone chloroformed her and tossed her in the Thames.Holmes' brother Microft, a government official, orders Sherlock to abandon the case, but Sherlock peruses it.

The results are wonderful for the serious film fan, but less so for Wilder. The film, which was meant to be a three-hour, reserved-seat-type roadshow, was dramatically edited by the studio, and several sequences were deleted in entirety. Because the scenes were separate Holmes cases, unrelated to the main plot, the final product does not suffer in any way, and perhaps it is a better, tighter film for the editing. The ""remains"" of the deleted scenes are included on the DVD, so you can view them for yourself. The film was hastily released in neighborhood theaters in its truncated form, and although many critics liked it, it disappeared all too quickly. Many years passed before the film, as part of Wilder's amazing body of work, was finally rediscovered and given its due.But back to the film itself, a witty, cheeky, cynical and ultimately, a surprisingly romantic film which culminates in one of Holmes' most complex cases involving spies, a mysterious Frenchwoman, a submarine and even Queen Victoria. The late Robert Stephens (former spouse and co-satr of Maggie Smith) is the perfect Holmes, laconic, brilliant, bored, and almost always right, and Colin Blakeley is just the right foil as Watson. And Genevieve Page is quite wonderful and sexy as the enigmatic woman in the case. The production design is stunning, and Miklos Rosza's score, highlighted by his incredible violin concerto, is one of the best film scores Rosza ever composed (and that's saying a lot).This film desperately needs a blu-ray version, to clean up its quality and make certain it is being seen in all its cinematic glory.

But I also cannot say I did like it or even that it was okay, so I am stuck in the middle. I chose two stars, because what I do not like about it I dislike much more than I like what I do like.First of all, I should say that although I like Sherlock Holmes well enough, I never was a big fan. I much prefer other fictional detectives. So the fact that this movie takes great liberties with him, the stories about him, and the other characters in those stories matters to me not at all. My comments relate to the movie as a movie, not to its faithfulness to Doyle's stories.The problem is that I am gay. If I were straight, I might be in hog heaven watching this movie, with all the squirmy, slimy gay jokes and innuendos, the female nudity and leering thereat, etc. But I AM gay, and I love being gay and am genuinely proud and delighted to be gay, so portraying what I am as something undesirable and shameful does not entertain me.Robert Stephens is marvelous, as he always was, particularly when he was young; Christopher Lee is a charmer at any age; and Colin Blakely is fine as Watson. I am thinking my problem is Billy Wilder. I have not seen Some Like It Hot in a very long time, but I suspect the comical cross-dressing and the potential horrors implicit in it would bother me now too.Evidently Wilder was none too fond of homosexuality and other alternate ways of being except as opportunities to leer and squirm and make wisecracks. Too bad. Not for him - he's dead - but for me.

Oh yes, and let's not forget a woman in a wheelchair, a signalling parasol, and a Scottish castle under construction.Put these all together and you get a devilishly entertaining film shot through with Holmes' mordant wit (for which Watson is the perfect foil), and, as well, with his keen intelligence.  The only (minor) flaw I found was how it was that Holmes was not able to decipher the real identity of a critical personage in the tale; that person's real identity was supplied by someone other than Sherlock, which was very surprising.  Nevertheless, this is a great film that never bores. Laughter, thrills, and puzzles abound.Colin Blakely is Dr. Watson--to a T.  The remaining supporting cast is equally fine.

Some say the final result was far from the great Billy Wilder's vision as the ""evil"" studio heads drove him to tears by chopping up the film to create a shorter, theater-friendly version. Others say Wilder became disenchanted with the film as time went on and the end result proves he just wanted to get it over and done with. Whatever the truth may be, I think fans of the novels and Wilder may find some enjoyment in this. Others may turn it off after the first 20 minutes.The finished film is really two stories. The first has to do with Wilder attempting to make light of the ""real"" relationship between Holmes and Watson. In 1970, this ""Are they gay?"" storyline was something daring. Today, it is tame and boring. Hence the idea those first 20 minutes may be tough to sit through even if a few laughs are provided along the way. But fortunately the main story kicks into gear and provides what I think is everlasting enjoyment. The characters and mystery all come to vivid life and though, as some have mentioned, the ending may not be for everyone's taste, the ride is an awful lot of fun.EXTRAS: I found the extras hard to sit through. Christopher Lee is interviewed and does have some tidbits about the shooting of the film but for the most part talks about his previous incarnations of Holmes. There is also an interview with an editor that drones on and on. I tried sitting thru the attempt to rebuild the so called ""lost footage"" using storyboards, pictures, and script lines but alas, after a while I hit the stop button on this as well. I guess it is nice these were included but what I felt was missing was the actual story of what Wilder was really trying to accomplish with this movie.

355469,A1YHHM3QFKCBCK,6303091989,M2,"[5, 5]","For decades, we fans of ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" have waited for someone to discover the fabled excised scenes, and lo and behold, here they are on the DVD.  And guess what?  They were right to cut them in the first place.  The removal of the three extra scenes in no way hurts the film as it was released in 1970, and only one, ""The Upside-Down Room,"" which delves into the special relationship that exists between Holmes and Watson (not the hints at gayness that are exploited to comic effect in the official version, but the affection and concern Watson holds for his friend), really resonates and could have remained.  The others seem somewhat frivolous.  But with or without them, ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" remains a touching, lovely film.  Robert Stephens is an affecting, if atypical Holmes whose performance was heavily criticized upon the film's initial release, but time has been very kind to it.  Colin Blakely is just wonderful at Watson:  loyal, faithful, but sometimes indignant and frustrated.  The sequence in which he is forced to act as valet to Holmes' ""Mr. Ashdown"" is a gem.  The real scene thief, however, is Christopher Lee as Sherlock's brother Mycroft.  This might be Lee's best performance out of the thousand or so films he's made, one that shows a sense of comedy not always evident in the actor's work.

What's a  gentleman, even one who's a bit of a misogynist, supposed to do?).  Robert  Stephens brings wit, melancholy, and anger to the role, keeping all of  these elements of Holmes' personality at play simultaneously, and he is  matched splendidly by Colin Blakely's Dr. Watson, who's smarter than Nigel  Bruce's Watson and more fun than Conan Doyle's.  Page is poised, charming,  and ambiguous as the heroine, just the sort of girl to hold Holme's  interest.  There's also a wonderful supporting performance by Christopher  Lee as Holmes' brother Mycroft, a sputtering mixture of affection and  aggravation for his impetuous younger brother.  And all of this is played  against the backround of a splendid score by Miklos Rosza, adapted from his  Second Violin Concerto (even if you don't like the movie, try and get a  recording of the music).

The most significant problem is the depiction of Dr. Watson as a buffoon; the Holmes canon has entertained readers for decades in part because Watson serves as a good stand-in for the audience, asking the questions we would want to ask, considering the evidence we would consider, and so forth. Therecent BBC reboot of the Holmes storiescaptures this very well, with Martin Freeman as Watson reacting to Holmes and Holmes' fame in a way that humanizes the detective, allowing him to be as freakishly obsessive and anti-social as the plot requires without making him unsympathetic. ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" fails to do this. Watson is portrayed as a fool with no self-awareness, leaving Holmes to carry all the weight of being both an incomparable super-genius and providing the only recognizably realistic human behavior on the screen. The imbalance skews every scene Watson is in, often to the point of being cringe-worthy.The script calls for some humor, much of which is dated and lame. In the opening sketch, virtually all the humor comes from Holmes pretending that he and Watson are gay lovers, thus drawing a group of male ballet dancers to show interest in Watson and breaking the hearts of the ballerinas (because, naturally, all male ballet dancers are gay, and all gay men would find a portly middle-aged Englishman to be irresistible. No other people in the movie comment on Watson's apparent irresistibility, so the fascination of the ballerinas is the greatest mystery in the plot of the whole film). There is no subtlety in this sketch; it is played very broadly. The script relies on the audiences finding homosexuality to be inherently funny, and maybe people thought it was in 1970, but from the perspective of 2013, the whole thing comes across as faintly desperate.That sketch complete, we move to the main mystery, which seems to have been lifted from an episode ofScooby-Doo(I joke, but the cartoon hit the airwaves in 1969, a year before this movie was released, so it may even be possible). Ignoring some of the improbabilities in the story, we eventually reach its comic set piece -- a bizarre visit by Queen Victoria to the site where England's first submarine is to be launched. She had apparently never been briefed on why she was being asked to visit this remote location and is appalled to discover that the submarine is intended to be used in warfare, rather than to look at fish. She demands the boat be scuttled. The entire encounter is intended for humor, but for me it was bizarre and unfunny.Christopher Lee was fine as Mycroft Holmes.

This movie does have its share of intrigue as well, but, as the title indicates, it is not a typical Holmes case. It is much or more about taking a deeper look at Holmes the person.One thing that's very different about this film is that Holmes develops an attraction to a woman and as a result is blinded to what the clues in this case really mean. This is in deliberate contrast to the beginning of the film where Watson questions whether Holmes is interested in women at all. Watson soon finds himself sidelined when Holmes finds himself strangely attracted to Belgian beauty Gabrielle who is at the core of the case.If you watch this movie, try to keep an open mind. It is not the typical Holmes film.  This is a deliberately different portrayal and re-examination of the characters. Watson is a bit more of a hot-head than in other films.

Robert Stephens (now deceased - he was Maggie Smith's ex-husband as well as father of the actor Toby Stephens - Toby is a carbon copy of his dad!) plays a brave and very intelligent Sherlock. His Holmes appeared to me to be rather effeminate ... or maybe that was his stage makeup? Or perhaps they wanted him to appear gay?I wish the storyline had done more with the ballerina wanting to parent a child with Sherlock. The scene where they are all in Scotland and Mycroft is explaning the H.M.S. Jonah seemed to be very dragging for me.

One of its concerns is that perennial question: was Holmes gay? In a short episode that serves as a kind of prologue he infuriates Watson by pretending that he is and that they are lovers but this is only to escape from a delicate and difficult situation. Or is it? The main storyline, intended in part to shed light on this question, concerns a beautiful young woman who seeks Holmes out to consult him about her engineer husband who has mysteriously disappeared.Billy Wilder is about the most distinguished director to turn his hand to a Holmes movie so you'd expect it to be at least fun. And it is fun. As should be clear already the storyline is not one of Conan's Doyle's own but it's engagingly dramatic and Wilder is abundantly aware that it's utterly essential for any Holmes story to contain lines like these:Watson: It is Valladon, isn't it?Holmes: Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green. And why there are three dead canaries in the coffin. White canaries.Capital.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[4, 5]","In Billy Wilder's melancholy THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1970), Robert Stephens is Holmes and Colin Blakely is Dr. Watson.  It is a wonderful creation by Wilder--a mysterious woman (Genevieve Page) calling herself Gabrielle Valledon arrives at 221B Baker Street having pulled out of the Thames.  Obviously not whom she claims to be, which is half the fun here and all of the romance in a very romantic Wilder film, Madame Valledon leads Holmes and Watson by train into the Scottish highlands.  There they will tangle with midget anarchists and seemingly the Loch Ness monster; Queen Victoria makes a memorable cameo.  Oh, and of course there is the 7% cocaine solution never to be found in a Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes movie.This is a gorgeously made movie, from the art direction and Panavision cinematography, to a towering score by Miklos Rozsa.  Stephens and Blakely seem born to play Holmes and Watson.  The movie was conceived, in a roadshow movie age, at 200 minutes.  Several mini stories would be like entrees before the Loch Ness monster main course.  But Wilder and editor Ernest Walter sensibly and skillfully pruned the finished movie to a tight 125 minutes with just one ""entree"" before the main action.The DVD is a ""must own"" for all Sherlock Holmes devotees because of its bonuses--a chat with Christopher Lee, who plays Mycroft Holmes; an in-depth conversation with editor Walter on what the original roadshow movie was really like; and, most of all, a Deleted Scenes section that is at least 90 minutes long, making it longer than the entire cut footage.  In this bonus section MGM Home Entertainment has done a masterful job of re-creating the 200 minute movie with existing footage, production stills, and screenplay pages where nothing else exists.  Missing are the soundtrack of the Case of the Naked Honeymooners---the visual exists and subtitles supply the missing soundtrack.  Production stills and screenplay pages make up a totally extraneous and boring original prologue.  A five minute flashback to Holmes at Oxford is a mixture of existing visual and screenplay pages; it was cut near the end of the movie and missed by me.  And the rather silly Case of the Upside-Down Room has production stills and screenplay pages for footage totally lost.I'm of the minority opinion that Wilder and Walter created a masterpiece in trimming away the extraneous stories, leaving one intact with Clive Revill and Russian dancers, and focusing entirely on the mystery of Gabrielle Valledon and the Loch Ness monster.  THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is another Billy Wilder masterpiece. one with a haunting sadness and melancholy romance to make it very special.  And Rozsa's  score is one of his absolute greatest.

Indeed, ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" has never looked better or more complete on the small screen, as it is presented here in a digitally remastered widescreen format that preserves the integrity of director and co-writer Wilder's original vision.  As fans of the film know, Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond fill in the blanks regarding the sexual orientation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous literary creation (a hot topic among intellectuals in the late 1960s) with both a sparkling wit and grand sense of respect for the subject matter.  In the film, Holmes embarks on his most scandalous case, which includes the search for a missing engineer, the discovery of secrets of state, and his burgeoning love for a mysterious woman who might not be who she claims.  With his lisp and penchant for sarcasm, Robert Stephens' Holmes is less the classical hero than in previous screen versions, going so far as to chide Watson (played wonderfully by Colin Blakely) for embellishing both his habits and physical stature in his ""Strand Magazine"" articles, yet Stephens' Holmes retains the keen mind, loyal affability, and vulnerable spirit we have come to admire.  The supporting cast, which includes Christopher Lee as Mycroft Holmes, is excellent, but it is the production, including Miklos Rosza's hauntingly luscious score, that helps propel the film to greatness.  Now, the bad news:  As most fans know, Wilder wanted this film to be more than three hours long and contain several other adventures that would complete this heretofore unknown set of cases whose ""delicate and sometimes scandalous nature"" made them unsuitable for print.  Unfortunately, the studio forced him to cut much of that footage, only some of which is included here (and without sound; in other cases, stills of filmed scenes are intercut with pages of the script and recorded dialogue).  The result is that those of us who have waited for years to see the film as the brilliant Wilder had intended it have to make due with the bits and pieces included here.

355494,A2H5W4UNFFE785,6303091989,Steven Keller,"[0, 1]","The Private life of Sherlock Holmes is an outstanding film on all levels.  The script is an adult sophisticated comedy, erudite and witty, but never falling to the level of farce.  A lot of this, of course, is due to the superb writing of Billy Wilder and I A L Diamond.This is one of those films that captivates from the first moment - one's eyes never leave the screen for fear of missing some action or some great performance.  And what performances there are too!  From good old Stanley Holloway as a gravedigger to Irene Handl as Holmes' and Watson's landlady, to Clive Revill as the Director of the Russian Imperial Ballet to Tamara Toumanova as the prima ballerina - all uniformly good and a delight to watch.  The fun begins when one realizes that Toumanova has chosen Holmes (out of dozens of well-known gentlemen, including Tchaikovsky and Nietzsche) to sire a child for her!Robert Stephens as Sherlock Holmes gives, arguably, the best performance of his career.  I would even dare say that in my humble opinion, Stephens is the best interpreter of Holmes on screen - his portrayal is that of a sensitive man, intelligent, charming and cunning, but with vulnerability about him that makes Holmes so human and not the cardboard cutout that the portrayal sometimes proves to be.Colin Blakely as Watson is simply hilarious - he throws himself so completely into the part and with such vigor that you fall in love (yes, love) with Watson from his first scene.  If we could all have such a ""Watson"" in our lives!Genevieve Page, as the female lead, is a lesson in good acting and becomes one with the character.  There's a wonderful chemistry between Page and Stephens that makes these characters so human and accessible.  The always-impressive Christopher Lee turns in another wonderful performance as Mycroft Holmes - witty and intense at the same time.  It is fun to watch Sherlock and Mycroft together - not too dissimilar, but rather like bookends!Homage must be paid to the inimitable Billy Wilder, the director, who always seems to add a bit of whipped-cream to everything he touches - even his most dramatic films.  Nothing seems amiss in this film; the continuity is certainly among the top I have seen in 50 years of film viewing.  I credit Wilder with keeping things moving and in the most charming manner.One thing that should be addressed and is little spoken of is the look of the film - it's the beautiful, soft look of an old cabinet card - a perfect evocation of the 1890s.  The color photography is gorgeous - thank God this film was made before everything got dark and we lost all of our beautiful color to the grim and gritty world of today's Hollywood!  This is a film you will want to view over and over, and in deference to Billy Wilder, I must add that it is the rare Wilder film that I cannot watch over and over and continually be delighted with!",5,Excellent film -- a pure delight!,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2876,"['Private', 'life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'outstanding', 'film', 'levels', 'script', 'adult', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'erudite', 'witty', 'never', 'falling', 'level', 'farce', 'lot', 'course', 'due', 'superb', 'writing', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'A', 'L', 'Diamond.This', 'one', 'films', 'first', 'moment', 'one', 'eyes', 'never', 'leave', 'screen', 'fear', 'missing', 'action', 'great', 'performance', 'what', 'performances', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'old', 'Stanley', 'Holloway', 'gravedigger', 'Irene', 'Handl', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'landlady', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'Director', 'Russian', 'Imperial', 'Ballet', 'Tamara', 'Toumanova', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'uniformly', 'good', 'delight', 'watch', 'fun', 'when', 'one', 'Toumanova', 'chosen', 'Holmes', 'dozens', 'well-known', 'gentlemen', 'including', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Nietzsche', 'sire', 'child', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'would', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Stephens', 'best', 'interpreter', 'Holmes', 'screen', 'portrayal', 'sensitive', 'man', 'intelligent', 'charming', 'cunning', 'vulnerability', 'Holmes', 'so', 'human', 'not', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'portrayal', 'sometimes', 'be.Colin', 'Blakely', 'Watson', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'so', 'completely', 'part', 'such', 'vigor', 'fall', 'love', 'yes', 'love', 'Watson', 'first', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'Watson', 'lives', 'Genevieve', 'Page', 'female', 'lead', 'lesson', 'good', 'acting', 'one', 'character', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Page', 'Stephens', 'characters', 'so', 'human', 'accessible', 'always-impressive', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Mycroft', 'Holmes', 'witty', 'intense', 'same', 'time', 'fun', 'watch', 'Sherlock', 'Mycroft', 'together', 'not', 'too', 'dissimilar', 'rather', 'bookends', 'Homage', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'inimitable', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'director', 'who', 'always', 'add', 'bit', 'whipped-cream', 'everything', 'even', 'most', 'dramatic', 'films', 'Nothing', 'amiss', 'film', 'continuity', 'certainly', 'top', 'have', 'seen', '50', 'years', 'film', 'viewing', 'credit', 'Wilder', 'keeping', 'things', 'moving', 'most', 'charming', 'manner.One', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'little', 'spoken', 'look', 'film', 'beautiful', 'soft', 'look', 'old', 'cabinet', 'card', 'perfect', 'evocation', '1890s', 'color', 'photography', 'gorgeous', 'thank', 'God', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'everything', 'got', 'dark', 'lost', 'beautiful', 'color', 'grim', 'gritty', 'world', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'view', 'deference', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'must', 'add', 'rare', 'Wilder', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'continually', 'be', 'delighted']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS
355495,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6303091989,Trevor Willsmer,"[14, 17]","A long-time dream project for Billy Wilder, beginning life as a musical, going through several years of rewrites and casting proposals - at one point even a vehicle for Peter O'Toole and Peter Sellers until the director found both impossible to make a deal with - before going into production as a hugely expensive $10m budgeted three-hour plus roadshow picture only to be cut down to little over two hours when exhibitors refused to book the uncut version, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is something of a legend in itself. The whereabouts of all the elements for a full restoration has long defied the finest minds in film restoration, adding a layer of mystique and what-if? to the film's reputation.The best way to watch The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is to forget what could have been and marvel at what is left. For all its problems, even in the heavily cut version that was eventually released, this is one of Billy Wilder's greatest and certainly most heartfelt achievements - and a pretty good yarn as well, throwing missing dwarves, dead canaries, Trappist monks, Swan Lake, Sherlock's mysterious brother Mycroft, Queen Victoria and the Loch Ness Monster into the mix, as well as an amnesiac woman who rouses more than Holmes' professional curiosity, to tragic results.Throughout, Wilder presents a much less self-assured vision of the great detective than had been seen before. In the opening scene he castigates Watson for the expectations the Doctor's stories in Strand Magazine have instilled in the public, and the film proceeds to ultimately explore that painful gap between expectations and reality with no mercy to the character's feelings but much compassion.Where to Watson's spirit of adventure, all things are possible, to Holmes all things can be disassembled and found wanting. There's real pain, loneliness and despair behind his faade of dry wit. Robert Stephens' Holmes is a genuinely tragic figure, a victim of his own intellect whose descent into becoming a thinking machine is more an act of self-defence at his poor judgement in matters romantic. The final shots of him reaching for a shot of cocaine to hide a broken heart are one of the most haunting images of its era.Colin Blakely's Watson too is a great creation. He is never mere comic relief or the all-too-familiar buffoonish stereotype but a fully realised figure pained by his inability to deal with his friend's drug use (and discomfort with being his unwitting supplier). There's a humanity, familiarity and genuine emotional interdependence to their partnership that most other screen pairings have missed, aided immensely by some remarkable writing. If there's such a thing as a script so sharp you could cut yourself on it, then parts of this could cause fatal injury. To quote every good line would mean typing out half of the script, and certainly the entire Bolshoi Ballet where Clive Revill's impresario makes an unusual business proposal to Holmes. But it's not all highbrow. Example: ""Who's that at this hour?"" ""Maybe Mrs Hudson is entertaining?"" ""Really? I've never found her so.""But more than amusing dialogue, this is a film which has been clearly thought through in every detail - at one point, Holmes' is even glimpsed through a haze of smoke as boredom clogs his mind. Even though Wilder's visual imagination is limited, the film is sumptuous to look at, particularly in its proper widescreen ratio, but for many, the major impetus for buying this DVD will be the location of the soundtrack (but not the picture) for the original opening half-hour of the picture (including The Case of the Upside Down Room) and the picture (but not the sound) for The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners.The weight of expectation that comes with what has thus far been located of the missing footage is, in truth, more than two of the episodes can bear. The real gem is The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room, less for the case itself but for what it tells us about the relationship between Holmes and Watson, precipitating a crisis that is only resolved by deceit on Holmes' part (Holmes' admission to Watson is very affecting). It's also the only deleted section that seems to serve a real purpose in the film's design. Neither the original opening scene in the train, more of a skit than anything of significance, or The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners advance the plot or illuminate the characters, being little more than overextended, very mildly amusing sketches.The supplementary section is also mildly disappointing, not because of the effort put in by the producers of the original laserdisc who collated many of them: again, it's a case of decades of expectation working against it. The laserdisc included an early draft script which was intriguing - apparently almost everything was filmed - but also contained some crudely misplaced elements. Mycroft's line about the last doctor who warned him about his gout falling on an orange peel and breaking his neck originally replaced the fruit with a very unconvincing use of the word 'turd,' while the original addenda to the ending, with Lestrade asking Watson if Holmes will help solve the Jack the Ripper case, seems particularly lame. However, for this DVD release only script and stills montages for the deleted scenes are included.The stills archive is good, although it is a shame that it limits itself to purely colour shots. However, there is far too little of the pressbook for those who want to know more about the film. For some reason a panned-and-scanned version of the quite brilliant but spoiler-heavy trailer has been used, and a well-worn one at that (note to newcomers to the film: avoid it until you've seen it, as it gives away two major plot twists). A lengthy on-camera interview with editor Ernest Walter is also included, although be warned that he gets one detail wrong (it is indeed Jenny Hanley who played Holmes' university `sweetheart' in a lost flashback sequence), while, exclusive to the DVD, there's also a 15-minute interview with Christopher Lee. The isolated music track of Miklos Rozsa's superb score that was on the laserdisc is NOT included on the DVD (the track was problematic: with the masters long lost, a dubbing mix track was used with the volume varying wildly).Picture quality is somewhat disappointing, especially compared to the laserdisc - a bit soft and definitely in need of a remastering.",5,A truly great movie even in its

Unfortunately, this movie is now unavailable on DVD, and that's a crime. A few years ago (1993?), it was released lovingly on laser disc in all its glory (widescreen), including many wonderful extras (lost scenes, lost audio, behind-the-scenes photos, etc.).

The first is They Might Be Giants (with Joanne Woodard a woman named Watson and George C. Scott as a man who believes he is Sherlock Holmes) and Billy Wilder's late period masterpiece. Stuffed with Wilder's characteristic cynical wit, sophisticated dialog and outstanding performances The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes has been out of circulation for too long.MGM's terrific reissue features a number of extras that make this edition worth waiting for. While it doesn't have the cut scenes reintegrated into the film, it does feature a deleted scenes gallery that suggests how the film might have been had it not been butchered prior to general release. Sadly, there's much missing from this ""lost"" footage and, as a result, we don't get a restoration as much as a ""recreation"" with bits and pieces and script segments.While this isn't the best transfer I've seen, the overall look is still pretty good. Yes, the look of the film is a bit washed out (not sure if that's due to the transfer or film stock but, knowing about the instability of film stock and less than pristine storage conditions many of these films were kept in, I'd vote for negative deterioation)but it is presented in its original aspect ratio. The overall presentation is quite good considering what MGM had to work with and, barring a restoration by someone like Robert Harris, this is probably the best version we'll ever see.Christopher Lee shines during his brief screen time as Holmes brother. Lee did eventually get to play Holmes as well so it's rather funny to see him playing Holmes brother (after also playing Baskerville in Terry Fisher's Hound of the Baskervilles). Robert Stephens IS Holmes in this film. He lives and breathes the character in ways that Rathbone and others never quite did. I've seen some criticism of Colin Blakely's Watson here but find it to be little more than critcial bluster. Blakely's take on Watson manages to both tip the hat to Nigel Bruce and satirize the way the character was emasculated in most of the film adaptions of Doyle's work.Oh, I'd like to add The Seven Percent Solution to my list of great Holmes adventures not written by Doyle but, sadly, it isn't available in widescreen(at least I haven't been able to find it) on DVD.",4,70's Masterpiece finally available on DVD,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,2395,"['sad', 'commentary', 'films', 'featuring', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'two', 'favorites', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Doyle', 'first', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'Joanne', 'Woodard', 'woman', 'named', 'Watson', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'man', 'who', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'late', 'period', 'masterpiece', 'Stuffed', 'Wilder', 'characteristic', 'cynical', 'wit', 'sophisticated', 'dialog', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Private', 'Life', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'been', 'circulation', 'too', 'long.MGM', 'terrific', 'reissue', 'number', 'extras', 'make', 'edition', 'waiting', ""n't"", 'have', 'cut', 'scenes', 'reintegrated', 'film', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gallery', 'how', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'butchered', 'prior', 'general', 'release', 'Sadly', 'much', 'missing', 'lost', 'footage', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'restoration', 'as', 'much', 'recreation', 'bits', 'pieces', 'script', 'segments.While', ""n't"", 'best', 'transfer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'overall', 'look', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Yes', 'look', 'film', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'not', 'sure', 'due', 'transfer', 'film', 'stock', 'knowing', 'instability', 'film', 'stock', 'less', 'pristine', 'storage', 'conditions', 'many', 'films', 'were', 'kept', ""'d"", 'vote', 'negative', 'deterioation', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'overall', 'presentation', 'quite', 'good', 'considering', 'what', 'MGM', 'had', 'work', 'barring', 'restoration', 'someone', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'probably', 'best', 'version', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.Christopher', 'Lee', 'shines', 'brief', 'screen', 'time', 'Holmes', 'brother', 'Lee', 'did', 'eventually', 'get', 'play', 'Holmes', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'funny', 'see', 'playing', 'Holmes', 'brother', 'also', 'playing', 'Baskerville', 'Terry', 'Fisher', 'Hound', 'Baskervilles', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'IS', 'Holmes', 'film', 'character', 'ways', 'Rathbone', 'others', 'never', 'quite', 'did', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criticism', 'Colin', 'Blakely', 'Watson', 'here', 'find', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'critcial', 'bluster', 'Blakely', 'take', 'Watson', 'manages', 'hat', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'satirize', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'emasculated', 'most', 'film', 'adaptions', 'Doyle', 'work.Oh', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'Seven', 'Percent', 'Solution', 'list', 'great', 'Holmes', 'not', 'written', 'Doyle', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'available', 'widescreen', 'least', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'DVD']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS
355499,A208I29OP8ZIRP,6303091989,"William J. Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[5, 6]","I've read most all of these reviews, after having just seen this movie for the first time. Why I've waited this long, I have no idea, as I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan ever since I was 10 years old. I am now 46, and I've seen just about every version and incarnation of Sherlock Holmes that's available for viewing in ANY format, but I just had never gotten around to Billy Wilder's classic, I had thought.Maybe the reason I hadn't seen it yet was because it didn't do well at the box office, and also because I'd heard that there were inklings in this movie that Holmes and Watson were gay lovers. Now, I don't consider myself a prude, in the least, but to a true Holmesian purist such as myself, this seemed almost blasphemous to me, and I just didn't want to think of my beloved Holmes and Watson in that manner. There was no call to add that ridiculous twist.I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that it went hand-in-hand with the farcical and satirical nature of the film, and was just a sub-plot that never was expounded on. As I watched, it became delightful and riveting, and the 2 hours, 5 minutes FLEW by.I didn't even know there were scenes that were deleted until I saw the extras, and imagine my delight when they paid off by explaining the meaning of the 'seven of diamonds' playing card that was removed from the strongbox at the beginning of the movie! It was glaringly obvious to me, after the movie ended, that the playing card was NEVER mentioned at all in the movie, and I had no idea what it was supposed to represent, but the DVD extras showed that it came from the 'Upside-Down Room' subplot that was deleted from the movie. One of the very difficult things about watching movies that got hacked to pieces like this one did is trying to account for everything related to those hacked scenes.

It's a fair mystery, with a bumbiling Watson, a Mycroft decidedly on the gray side (not light or dark, actually, but could go either way), and a Sherlock with at least his share of human foibles. Ennui among them - when assailed by under-excitement, he retreats to his 7% solution (watered down to 5%, by the friend looking out for his health).But, since this artifact comes down to us from the 1970s, Cold War angst underlies the major plot. Super-weapon, German (East German?) spy, layers of intelligence agencies - and all that wrapped around a story that might have dated from the early inklings of WWI. But, the era adds more to the layered anachronisms. A strong leading lady reminds us that Women's Lib emerged in the 1970s (and echoed the suffragettes leading up to the 1920s). Even more, though, early parts of the movie offer a subversive kind of acceptance of gays. It's kind of a ""don't ask don't tell, but you know and we know"" sort of acceptance, but a thin edge of a wedge nevertheless. Maybe the 1970s foretold the 2000-era social change, and maybe they echoed experimental social conventions of the 1920s.A good story in itself, and worth seeing for that reason. But, if you want a melange of social norms chosen from many decades (and possibly decades in this movie's future), the subtext is well worth reading.-- wiredweird",4,Interesting and very watchable,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1369,"['First', 'watchable', 'part', 'fair', 'mystery', 'bumbiling', 'Watson', 'Mycroft', 'decidedly', 'gray', 'side', 'not', 'light', 'dark', 'actually', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'Sherlock', 'least', 'share', 'human', 'foibles', 'Ennui', 'when', 'assailed', 'under-excitement', '7', '%', 'solution', 'watered', 'down', '5', '%', 'friend', 'looking', 'out', 'health', '.But', 'artifact', 'down', '1970s', 'Cold', 'War', 'angst', 'major', 'plot', 'Super-weapon', 'German', 'East', 'German', 'spy', 'layers', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'wrapped', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'dated', 'early', 'inklings', 'WWI', 'era', 'more', 'layered', 'anachronisms', 'strong', 'leading', 'lady', 'Women', 'Lib', 'emerged', '1970s', 'echoed', 'suffragettes', 'leading', 'up', '1920s', 'Even', 'more', 'though', 'early', 'parts', 'movie', 'offer', 'subversive', 'kind', 'acceptance', 'gays', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'know', 'know', 'sort', 'acceptance', 'thin', 'edge', 'wedge', 'nevertheless', 'Maybe', '1970s', 'foretold', '2000-era', 'social', 'change', 'maybe', 'echoed', 'experimental', 'social', 'conventions', '1920s.A', 'good', 'story', 'worth', 'seeing', 'reason', 'want', 'melange', 'social', 'norms', 'chosen', 'many', 'decades', 'possibly', 'decades', 'movie', 'future', 'subtext', 'well', 'worth', 'reading.', 'wiredweird']",Private Life of Sherlock Holmes VHS
