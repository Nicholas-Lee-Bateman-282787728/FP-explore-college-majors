Obviously, the screenwriter and director decided to take you anywhere that could be terrifying -- a dark and dusty old barn, a cabin ruled by demonic forces, a bizarre old insane asylum, a hidden sealed up well.It has lots of terrifying images -- photos that come alive, submerged corpses, deadly falls from high places, malevolent beings you can't figure out that are out to kill you or maybe just take over your mind.

606316,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JLTK,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[9, 9]","(3.5 *'s) Nearly into the first thirty-five minutes of `The Ring' I got so many jolts, I nearly turned the DVD off.  Popular, and often revered by horror fans, the film renders a favorably mixed bag.  Conceptually it frightens and fascinates even if its premise is hokey, and there are many rules of thumb that are broken or inconsistent.  Still, I was glad to take the journey.  If the goal of a horror movie is to scare and tell a story, then the film truly has the goods to deliver.The movie is nearly universal, so I'll be brief:  Two teenage girls, Katie Embry and Becca Kotler, are sharing the tale of a video that once seen will be followed by a threatening phone call announcing the viewer has but one week to live.  The girls are playing it out as a ghost story as they jive and enthuse one another, but on every other turn each becomes serious until one girl gets the phone call.  There are many false alarms that work effectively, but once we're in, there's no turning back.A short time later, the death sentence has turned out to be true and the haunted vision comes upon those who have viewed the videotape.  Anyone would pass it off except all the teenagers associated with it stayed at a cabin with the tape turn up dead.Naturally, believing it or not requires investigation, so Katie's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is every bit willing and ready as she tries to tie together who or what caused her niece's death.  Her own son, Aidan (David Dorfman) is much like Cole in `The Sixth Sense,' and his own supernatural take on dreams and drawings gives us more of an eerie feeling about the whole affair.  Her loved one (Martin Henderson) is drawn into the sleuthing mission, but his skepticism does much for the film's tension.`The Ring' is a carefully crafted full-length `Twilight Zone' or `Night Gallery' adventure.  There was one episode of the latter where a ""Nutcracker"" curse was brought upon its recipients, but that was shorter with rules that seemed to work better.  Much of the credibility comes from the videotape itself, which would win in an art exhibition and brings much atmosphere to the movie, but it stretches belief a bit.  (Sprinkling clues to bring participants to the truth of a mystery--why not leave a straightforward message?  This is answered partly in the movie, but not well enough.)As a story it works.  It does have a mystery to unveil, and mostly it is a satisfying tale of tragedy, but I do have some complaints about the ending.  Without revealing the store, there's a scene played out near the fireplace that brings some question as to the rules being broken near the end.  The ending is meant to be a chilling resolution, but unintentionally the fireplace scene shows that the powers that be can be manipulated.  Let's just say I see a way out of the curse that the ending doesn't seem to indicate.(Based on a novel by Japanese author Koji Suzuki and an original Japanese movie.  Directed by Gore Verbinski.)(Special thanks to fellow reviewer Steve Hedge for putting this film on my radar screen.)",4,Solid 'Ring' with a Few Gaps in the Link,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,3050,"['3.5', '*', 'Nearly', 'first', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'Ring', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'jolts', 'nearly', 'turned', 'DVD', 'off', 'Popular', 'often', 'revered', 'horror', 'fans', 'film', 'favorably', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Conceptually', 'even', 'premise', 'hokey', 'are', 'many', 'rules', 'thumb', 'are', 'broken', 'inconsistent', 'Still', 'was', 'glad', 'take', 'journey', 'goal', 'horror', 'movie', 'scare', 'tell', 'story', 'then', 'film', 'truly', 'goods', 'deliver.The', 'movie', 'nearly', 'universal', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brief', 'Two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Katie', 'Embry', 'Becca', 'Kotler', 'are', 'sharing', 'tale', 'video', 'once', 'seen', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'threatening', 'phone', 'call', 'announcing', 'viewer', 'one', 'week', 'live', 'girls', 'are', 'playing', 'out', 'ghost', 'story', 'jive', 'enthuse', 'one', 'other', 'turn', 'serious', 'one', 'girl', 'phone', 'call', 'are', 'many', 'false', 'alarms', 'work', 'effectively', 'once', ""'re"", 'turning', 'back.A', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'death', 'sentence', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'haunted', 'vision', 'who', 'have', 'viewed', 'videotape', 'Anyone', 'would', 'pass', 'off', 'teenagers', 'associated', 'stayed', 'cabin', 'tape', 'turn', 'up', 'dead.Naturally', 'believing', 'not', 'investigation', 'Katie', 'aunt', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'bit', 'willing', 'ready', 'tie', 'together', 'who', 'what', 'caused', 'niece', 'death', 'own', 'son', 'Aidan', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'much', 'Cole', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'own', 'supernatural', 'take', 'dreams', 'drawings', 'more', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'whole', 'affair', 'loved', 'one', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'drawn', 'sleuthing', 'mission', 'skepticism', 'much', 'film', 'tension.', 'Ring', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'full-length', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'adventure', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'latter', 'where', 'Nutcracker', 'curse', 'was', 'brought', 'upon', 'recipients', 'was', 'shorter', 'rules', 'seemed', 'work', 'better', 'Much', 'credibility', 'videotape', 'would', 'win', 'art', 'exhibition', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'belief', 'bit', 'Sprinkling', 'clues', 'bring', 'participants', 'truth', 'mystery', 'why', 'not', 'leave', 'straightforward', 'message', 'answered', 'partly', 'movie', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'story', 'have', 'mystery', 'unveil', 'mostly', 'satisfying', 'tale', 'tragedy', 'do', 'have', 'complaints', 'ending', 'revealing', 'store', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'fireplace', 'question', 'rules', 'being', 'broken', 'end', 'ending', 'meant', 'be', 'chilling', 'resolution', 'unintentionally', 'fireplace', 'scene', 'powers', 'be', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'see', 'way', 'curse', 'ending', ""n't"", 'seem', 'indicate', 'Based', 'novel', 'Japanese', 'author', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'original', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'Directed', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'Special', 'thanks', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Steve', 'Hedge', 'putting', 'film', 'radar', 'screen']",N/A

The herione Rachel has to unravel the mystery which involves a young girl and her mother. The story-line does get confusing on the first watch. You almost have to watch it again just to get a better grasp.

606318,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00005JLTK,Ace-of-Stars,"[17, 76]","*[[Please Note: A few things in this review may be considered ''spoilers'' ... proceed with caution.]]Just a few months prior to the theatrical release of the American REMAKE of this Japanese horror/suspense sensation, I gave it a ''five star'' rating (based upon my impression of the Japanese Original) and suggested that it was worth a sit-down viewing, since I was basing my suggestion on what others who had seen both versions were saying (...they had claimed that the American ''remake'' remained ''faithful'' to the Japanese Original).""The Ring"" is based on the original Japanese horror sensation, ""Lingu,"" which, when it was originally released in 1998, was Japan's highest grossing horror/suspense film of all time.The story revolves around a news reporter who learns about an obscure video tape with a gruesome reputation: Anyone who views its brief and incomprehensible contents is guaranteed to die within seven days. Once dismissed as an urban legend circulating among the high school set, the reporter confirms the actual existence of the tape and unwittingly views it herself. She soon comes to the realization that the rumors about the tape's deadly effects are also true, and with the assistance of her ex-husband tries to determine the tape's sinister origins and to see if they can figure out how to break the curse before their remaining week of life reaches its deadline -- literally.The original Japanese film is dark, eerie and, though not particularly scary, is intense and engaging. Slow paced at times, and yet there's never a dull moment -- you'll not want to leave your seat.Well... if you've NEVER seen the Japanese Original, I'm about to make a suggestion: DON'T waste your time with the ''American'' remake ... at the very least, not ''UNTIL'' you've seen the Japanese Original! (There seems to be some indication that the original version can expect an official DVD release for the American market sometime in the near future. For the time being, however, it is only available on the Asian market.)Why and how did I change my recommendation so quickly? Simply because I had the good fortune (or, perhaps, misfortune) to see one of those pesky little things called ''Theatrical Trailers!''The movie trailer for the American remake reveals MORE THAN ENOUGH to show that far too many significant changes were made to the story to make recommending it virtually impossible! If you still want to see the ''Americanized'' version, regardless, then please be aware of these few important deviations and departures from the Original:(1): The ''Title'' --The ''American'' version emphasizes the ''meaning'' of the movie's title by repeatedly slapping us over the head with the phrase, ''Before you die, you see the Ring.'' Uhhh... 'Sorry, Charlie,' but in the Japanese Original NO EXPLANATION OF ANY SORT was ever given as to the meaning of the film's title! The title was DELIBERATELY ambiguous! Does the ''ring'' refer to the image on the cursed video? Does it refer to the ''ring'' of the telephone which the unfortunates receive immediately after viewing said video? Does it refer to the endless cycle of death brought about by the endless recopying and distribution of the cursed tape? Etc., Etc., Etc.(2): The ''Horses'' --What the hell did ''dying horses'' have to do with the movie??? ''Horses'' (dead or alive) played absolutely no role in the Original!(3): The ''Phone Message'' --There was NO VOICE (little girl's or otherwise) in the phone calls which followed the viewing of the cursed video! What was heard in the Original was an incoherent and indecipherable high-pitched electronic-like ''squeal'' (for lack of a better descriptive term) ... no words were ever uttered!(4): The Irritating ''Precocious Little Boy'' --In the Original, the reporter's son was no one spectacular and played no real role in the movie, except by privately viewing the video himself and relating to his mother one or two post-mortem communications he supposedly had with one of the people recently ''killed by the curse'' who happened to be a family friend of sorts. Those mysterious contacts between him and the recently dead girl, though adding to the suspense just a tad, were ultimately meaningless to the plot.(5): The ''Creepy Girl'' --Perhaps the most unforgivable overstepping of the American filmmakers. The face of ''Sadako'' (the name of the demon girl in the Original) WAS NEVER REVEALED (save for a solitary blood vessel laden eye), which only added to her creepiness and made her even more scary!(5b): The ''Squeaky-Clean Creepy Girl'' --Though not presented as an image on the actual film trailer, I did run across images of the girl's body being found in her watery grave. In the original, Sadako was found very, Very, ...VERY DEAD in the well! Completely decomposed flesh, slimy green goo and all! How did the American filmmakers justify ''uncovering'' her dead body fresh fleshed and fully clothed in a clean cream-colored gown? Anybody?(6): Those ''Two Old Ladies'' --The two ''schoolgirls'' at the opening of ''Lingu'' actually LOOKED like schoolgirls, because the Japanese filmmakers actually used real live ''GIRLS'' to portray them! Who were those two old hags ''DreamWorks'' dug up and expected us to relate to as ''school-GIRLS,'' huh?(7): The 'Film Sets' and The 'Mood' --In the Original, EVERYTHING about the movie was dark,  gloomy and eerie... the set designs, the music, the cinematography,  even the actors themselves ...everything had an uneasy, creepy & depressing quality to it, as any good horror/suspense movie should; The American version looks much too upbeat, bright and 'user-friendly.'Yes, ALL OF THAT is what I was able to decipher from just the American version's ''movie trailer'' ALONE! (...paragraph ''5b'' excepted) -- Which leaves me to wonder just how much MORE damage the American team inflicted upon this movie which the trailer was NOT able to reveal???I'm not saying don't see this movie. But I indeed AM suggesting that you wait until you get a chance to view the Original Japanese masterpiece first before doing so.Have I seen the American remake version? No. Am I ''planning'' on seeing the American remake version? Not any more! -- Not since viewing the ''trailer!''Thanks, DreamWorks and Mr. Verbinski, but no thanks! For myself, personally, I'm sticking with the JAPANESE ORIGINAL!(I give ''American'' version ''two stars'' here because, judging from the story it was originally adapted from, I'm sure it's probably still a pretty good and nicely done movie ... though I'll never see it personally to know that for certain.)Dewa mata!_",2,BEFORE YOU SEE ''The Ring'' ...

I want to watch movies that scare the living hell out of me, make me almost afraid to turn the lights off after I go to sleep. I watched it, and I kept waiting-and waiting-and waiting to get scared, until finally, I decided this wan't the movie for me. In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it. I gave it an hour. Some people may say that I'm being unfair to review a movie I haven't seen in it's entirety. But the way I look at scary movies is this-If an hour has gone by and I'm still not scared, it's eject time. It was more like a mystery movie than a horror movie, and very Alfred Hitchcock/Stephen King styled, which also turned me off. Less hardened horror fans may like this movie more than I did. The movie is about a videotape that if you watch, you will end up dying after 7 days. It sounded kind of cool, and the movie does have a few VERY attractive young ladies starring in it, but it was the wrong movie to focus on hot girls with-it was supposed to be scary.

The reason behind the run of the mill, predictable, etc. deaths (did anyone ever wonder why almost ALL horror films deal with killings?) was a complicated, supernatural and illogical, just like all other silly horror films. Even the twist at the end was pathetic... Unfortunately, the plot was as standard and boring as they make them, and the story itself was unplausible and just too much (for me, at least) to believe. Add to that the boring characters were unlikeable, hard to sympathize with, and one dimensional - and you get a cinematic exeprience which is a horror in itself.

606323,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JLTK,A. Estes,"[3, 9]","""The Ring"" is yet another in a long line of movies that just can't live up to it's own hype. Hearing stories about people freaking out in theaters and odd things happening at home during viewings made me think I was in for one hell of a thrill. Despite the fact that I had my own eerie experience while watching this -- my phone started ringing at exactly the same time as the phone in the opening scene -- I still couldn't feel any intensity, any chills, or any entertainment. I don't ask much of my horror movies, not much at all, they don't have to be scary or full of gore (afterall, this is the guy who LIKED ""Open Water""), just as long as I can make some sort of connection and they entertain me for the 90+ minutes they run in. ""The Ring"" doesn't do that. Instead, we are subjected to a very good looking, but pretentious picture as done by ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" (another movie that had way too much hype) director, Gore Virbinski. Virbinski is no doubt a skilled director, but there is just too much eye candy here, as opposed to actual plot. Not for one minute did I really feel any characters were in danger, and the pace just kept going up and down so much that it just got annoying. Each time I would start to engage myself in the happenings, the movie would just let go of me. The overall story leaves much to be desired, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. I honestly don't understand how this movie could become such a phenomenom. Maybe it's just me. I know I need something a little more visceral to scare me or at least entertain me. ""The Ring"" is just a whole lotta nothing. There is one scene where a horse commits suicide that might arouse the sleepy haze that will most likely come over you, but it really has no other purpose to the story, and much like everything else in the movie, it was put there just to make you uncomfortable (it made me giggle uncontrollably). Towards the end of the movie, my dog barfed up a considerably large amount of food on my bed.

The writing, acting, and directing is all top-notch as far as I am concerned.  The atmosphere of the movie sets the stage for a story of dread and apprehension.  It takes an unbelievable premise and almost makes it seem plausible.  This is important to me for a horror movie to work.Though I did think the movie was scary, I might also describe it as a thriller.  The ""surprise ending"", which I in fact predicted, added to the appeal of the film.  To me it is a better version of the Japanese movie ""Ringu"" from which it was adapted.  As far as contradictions in the plot, few movies have a perfect story line.  The critics need to realize that there are movies other than dramas that are well made.  This is one of the best.The premise and basic storyline are brilliant.  The story that follows an investigation gives the writers a lot to work with.  Throughout the story as some questions are answered, new ones arise.  The atmosphere is intense and the fact that many things are shown only briefly (like Samara's face) or not at all add to the appeal of the movie.  Not all questions are answered, but again, maybe they shouldn't be....and that also sets up for a nice sequel too.

John Waters, for years now has been saying he only likes to make movies with &quot;edge&quot;. They say they want to break away from formula Hollywood and make daring, bold, films. Movies that lack convention. I admit, I do enjoy seeing something different. I like movies that try to experiment with new techniques. But, I also noticed that many of these young new filmmaker are forgetting something. They are so worried about &quot;breaking the rules&quot;, they are so concerned with creating odd situation after odd situation, just so they can say they're films are different and they are a work of art, that they leave out one of the most fundamental rules of movies. The audience has to care about the characters. When I watch a movie I don't care if the lead character is a man or woman, whether or not they share my same ideas of politics, religion, or whatever. All I ask is that I at least find the character to be interesting enough, where I'm willing to give my emotions to the character. That's what makes a great movie. When the movies is over, we feel we ourslves have went through the same journey as the characters in the film. Once in a while a movie will remember this rule. David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; was one of those movies. It was one of the most mind-blowing complex movies I've seen in a while. But, Gore Verbinski's &quot;The Ring&quot; is a movie that just didn't move me the way it could have or should have.I see a lot of people enjoy this movie. They find the movie to be scary, and how can I tell someone who thinks something is scary it isn't? That's like telling someone don't laugh at that joke, I didn't find it funny. But, &quot;The Ring&quot; just gets a little too odd for it's own good. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie starts off well. And I do admire Naomi Watts as an actress. I think she is very talented. I even wanted to see this movie when it was released. So, I was going into the movie with high expectations. I wanted to like. But &quot;The Ring&quot; lost my attention in the middle and through the end. The movie just becomes and series of bizarre events where, for me, 1+1 doesn't equal 2. Think of Kafka but without the brains. Is it surreal? Yes. Does it make sense? Not really. Could the movie work? Yes.I haven't seen the original foreign version of this movie. Now, it may be better or it may be worst. But if it's as werid as this movie, I don't want to see it.&quot;The Ring&quot; tells the story of a woman (Naomi Watts) who learns about a video tape that has a collection is meaningless things on it, but, after I think it was 7 days, whoever watches the tape dies. Of course the movie goes into other things, and there is more added to the story, but, I'll let you rent the movie to find out what. I've given you a vague summary of the movie. Believe it or not, but in the beginning of the movie the story works. I didn't find the movie to be scary, but, I did find it to be interesting, and that's all I really ask of any movie. Just be able to hold my interest. And &quot;The Ring&quot; does reach it goal. It's actually enjoyable to watch at first, and than, it gets werid. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. I just said I liked &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; and that was a werid movie, so what's my problem here? How ever werid &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; may have got, it always held my interest. I wanted to see how the movie would end because I cared enough about the character to know. I didn't really care enough about the characters in &quot;The Ring&quot; to care how it ended. And that breaks the movie. If they just would of added a bit of logic to the movie. If they would of made the movie more believeable I could of enjoyed it more. Isn't that what makes a movie scary? If what is happening in the movie seems real enough that it could happen in real life? Those are the kinds of movies that scary me. Not this kind of movie.Are there things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Well, if your a young filmmaker and you say you like to see movies with an &quot;edge&quot;, here you go! If you like Naomi Watts, and want to her all her movies again, here you go. Watts does in all fairness do a good job. She does give the character a certain level of heart need to carry our interest, but, it seems like no one else is helping her out. One person can't carry a movie by themself. Especially this type of movie.Bottom-line: Has some good points to it, but, over-all I wasn't scared by the movie. It gets too odd, and the audience can't really connect with anyone or anything. Goes a bit over the top and becomes silly at moments. Watts does though give a nice performance.",2,&quot;The Ring&quot; Didn't Quite Ring With Me,1049760000,"04 8, 2003",2003,4810,"['ever', 'hear', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'talk', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'always', 'hear', 'say', 'want', 'make', 'movies', 'have', 'quot', 'edge', 'quot', 'John', 'Waters', 'years', 'now', 'been', 'saying', 'only', 'make', 'movies', 'quot', 'quot', 'say', 'want', 'break', 'away', 'formula', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'daring', 'bold', 'films', 'Movies', 'lack', 'convention', 'admit', 'do', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'something', 'different', 'like', 'movies', 'try', 'experiment', 'new', 'techniques', 'also', 'noticed', 'many', 'young', 'new', 'filmmaker', 'are', 'forgetting', 'something', 'are', 'so', 'worried', 'quot', 'breaking', 'rules', 'quot', 'are', 'so', 'concerned', 'creating', 'odd', 'situation', 'odd', 'situation', 'just', 'can', 'say', ""'re"", 'films', 'are', 'different', 'are', 'work', 'art', 'leave', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'fundamental', 'rules', 'movies', 'audience', 'care', 'characters', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'lead', 'character', 'man', 'woman', 'not', 'share', 'same', 'ideas', 'politics', 'religion', 'ask', 'least', 'find', 'character', 'be', 'interesting', 'enough', 'where', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'emotions', 'character', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'When', 'movies', 'feel', 'ourslves', 'have', 'went', 'same', 'journey', 'characters', 'film', 'Once', 'while', 'movie', 'will', 'remember', 'rule', 'David', 'Lynch', 'quot', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'mind-blowing', 'complex', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have.I', 'see', 'lot', 'people', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'scary', 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'someone', 'who', 'something', 'scary', ""n't"", 'telling', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'joke', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'odd', 'own', 'good', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'do', 'admire', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'actress', 'think', 'very', 'talented', 'even', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'So', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'wanted', 'like', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'lost', 'attention', 'middle', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'becomes', 'series', 'bizarre', 'events', 'where', '1+1', ""n't"", 'equal', '2', 'Think', 'Kafka', 'brains', 'surreal', 'Yes', 'make', 'sense', 'Not', 'really', 'Could', 'movie', 'work', 'Yes.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'foreign', 'version', 'movie', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'as', 'werid', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'it.', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'story', 'woman', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'video', 'tape', 'collection', 'meaningless', 'things', 'think', 'was', '7', 'days', 'tape', 'course', 'movie', 'other', 'things', 'more', 'added', 'story', ""'ll"", 'let', 'rent', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', ""'ve"", 'given', 'vague', 'summary', 'movie', 'Believe', 'not', 'beginning', 'movie', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'scary', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'interesting', 'really', 'ask', 'movie', 'Just', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'interest', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'reach', 'goal', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'first', 'werid', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'just', 'said', 'liked', 'quot', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'quot', 'was', 'werid', 'movie', 'what', 'problem', 'here', 'How', 'ever', 'werid', 'quot', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'quot', 'may', 'have', 'got', 'always', 'held', 'interest', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'cared', 'enough', 'character', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'enough', 'characters', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'care', 'how', 'ended', 'movie', 'just', 'would', 'added', 'bit', 'logic', 'movie', 'would', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'believeable', 'could', 'enjoyed', 'more', ""n't"", 'what', 'movie', 'scary', 'what', 'happening', 'movie', 'real', 'enough', 'could', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'kinds', 'movies', 'scary', 'Not', 'kind', 'movie.Are', 'things', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'Well', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'say', 'like', 'see', 'movies', 'quot', 'quot', 'here', 'go', 'like', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'want', 'movies', 'again', 'here', 'go', 'Watts', 'fairness', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'give', 'character', 'certain', 'level', 'heart', 'need', 'carry', 'interest', 'one', 'else', 'helping', 'out', 'One', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'movie', 'themself', 'Especially', 'type', 'movie.Bottom-line', 'Has', 'good', 'points', 'over-all', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'movie', 'too', 'odd', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'anyone', 'anything', 'bit', 'top', 'silly', 'moments', 'Watts', 'give', 'nice', 'performance']",N/A

Not saying that ""The Ring"" is either superior or inferior, but it stayed very truthful to the original material it was based on, too truthful.For viewers who haven't had a chance to see ""Ringu"", you will find idea of ""The Ring"" wholly unique, nevertheless bizarre and ridiculous at the same time, depending on your cynicism level. But for those who have seen the original, you may think that the story of this US remake unfolds in an almost identical way, even though some incidents along the way were inserted or slightly altered to cater for the vaster audiences. In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion. In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far-fetched and hard to swallow to the English-speaking world. But in order to retain that sense of myth, a lot of elements converted (or rather not converted) into the US version do feel quite out of place.Verbinski, while flaring some ingenious camera setups, did not tackle the subtlety a movie that is largely atmospheric requires. ""The Ring"" is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here. Perhaps looking at Verbinski's r&eacute;sum&eacute; (Mousehunt, The Mexicans), he may be too cynical for a subject that deals with a video tape that kills people. However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.Where ""The Ring"" did fail is, not having convincing characters. Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career-driven news reporter, but she did not look frightened or concerned enough for a single-mother who knows her exact time and date of death. There was no sense of emergency that she is desperate to find out how to lift the curse, instead she spends the entire time questioning who was involved in the sad story behind the video. By the end of the seventh day the audiences are left to wander off somewhere forgetting why she needs to find out about the origin of the video in the first place. Secondly the son Aidan is too creepy, and without a trace of innocence for us to really care about what will happen to him. He shares no chemistry with his mother, spending the entire time staring into the far place, drawing dark pictures, or mumbling something about a imaginary friend. In another word, he seems more like a possessed puppet than your little nephew you would like to take to the carnival. In Alejandro Amenavar's ""The Others"", in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing. Another disappointing performance is from Martin Henderson as Noah. He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film. The expression he has for not believing the nonsense of a killer video is not so different from the one he knows his life could be in threat. Is he helping Rachel because he does have feelings for her, or does he just hope to get laid again because she is still hot? It was not explained, nor do we really care much.Though the number of extras on this DVD is disappointing, what it does offer is in fact quite neat. The picture is sharp and crisp, providing a good contrast of the grayish grim look of the film, with the bursting colors at times that will permanently damage your retina (in some way it actually distracts you from the mood the film is supposed to have). While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock-tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).An advertised ""never-before-seen short film"" could be seen by selecting the ""Don't look here"" option on the main menu. It is in fact a collection of deleted and extended scenes, featuring a few more graphic sequences trimmed from the theatrical release. Without commentary or additional information, it doesn't really reveal any more insights or secret than the film itself, but would definitely affect the rating if they were incorporated back into the film as an ""uncut edition"". Yet whether it would be a better viewing experience is another question. Also included is a very brief trailer of the original ""Ringu"" on DVD (also released by Dreamworks, surprise, surprise!), a theatrical trailer of ""Catch Me If You Can"", and an ""8 Mile"" DVD promo spot. If you are patient enough to play around with the remote a little bit more, you may find a not so pleasant easter egg! Overall ""The Ring"" DVD is a nice little package that will make your collection looks better...is that your phone ringing?",3,"For better of worse, it's a decent effort.",1047513600,"03 13,

606328,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005JLTK,Amanda,"[0, 0]","Before you die, you see the ring. Or, at least that's what the urban legend says in ""The Ring"" - the movie deemed ""the scariest movie of the year"". I say it is the best film of the year, of any genre. It was the only movie I saw from 2002 that kept my whole interest up until the very end; the only one where I couldn't wait to see what happened next; the only one that freaked me out so much, it actually accelerated my heartbeat in a few of the scenes.Some people say it wasn't scary at all, but these are probably the people who love all of those slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"". ""The Ring"" is not a slasher film; it kind of follows the same formula as ""Final Destination"", where people start dying, but nobody really knows why. There is not a lot of gore, nor is there really any good action sequences. It's a psychological thriller all of the way. And such a great one that it sticks in your mind long after it's over. Naomi Watts plays Rachel, a reporter who is investigating the death of her niece - whose demise seems to have something to do with the mysterious tape she and three of her friends watched seven days before they all died. According to the urban legend, anyone who watches this tape receives a phone call afterwards, and a voice on the other end says ""Seven days..."" And seven days later, you die. We see the tape - it's a very short film that is actually a bunch of strange snippets of different things: a ladder, a tree burning, a mysterious woman brushing her hair in the mirror, and a few other weird things. The whole tape plays out like a silent music video, and it's creepy heck. Just the scenes where anyone is watching the tape is creepy enough.If you like scary movies, you must see this one. And if you like it, you must own it. The only thing about this film that bothered me was that it left me with many unanswered questions. If you've seen it, you may know what I'm talking about. But maybe it just takes a couple of viewings for everything to click. I'm sure the film has its flaws (I noticed a few myself), but it will send chills down your spine - I know it did mine. And I rarely get spooked at movies. I deem it as the most original film of the year (even though it is a remake of the foreign film ""Ringu""), and the best film of the year, hands down.

606340,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLTK,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I may get a lot of flak for calling out `The Mothman Prophesies' for feeling incomplete and then kind of gushing all over `The Ring', but there are some stark differences between the two.  First of all, nothing about `The Ring' feels incomplete.  Incoherent maybe, but never incomplete.  The difference between the two films is that the ambiguous ending crafted and delivered in this particular film feels as though it BELONGS there.  Yes, you will turn off the television screen and ponder to yourself the truth behind the strange ending, but you will never doubt the filmmaker's credibility.  There is a sick sense of closure that develops with `The Ring' that isn't found in `The Mothman Prophesies'.  I think the professing to be `based on factual events' makes `The Mothman Prophesies' more accountable for their flaws.Reality should make sense, at least that's what the growing public expects.Okay, now that I got that out of the way, it's time to delve into the depths of `The Ring'.`The Ring' is basically the story of a woman who is in the throws of panic after her son watches a video that prophesies his death in seven days.  Knowing that she has to do something, even if there is nothing to do, she attempts to solve the mystery of the video (which is responsible for killing her niece).  Naturally, this woman is a reporter and so she serves a better chance at getting to the bottom of things than anyone else would.  Truth be told, the bottom of things is a pretty deep, deep pool (well, if you will) that demands further explanation.Yes, you will scratch your head a little.I applaud the film for attempting to explain itself.  The open-ended ending does create a sense of tension that permeates the room even after the film is over.  For this, I actually commend the film.  For everyone seeking further answers, there is much to be said for those contented with the films ambitious attempt at creating an unfathomable mystery.  The origins of the `video' and it's purpose itself remain rather mysterious in texture, but the overall complexities presented in the films conclusion defy anything a simple `explanation' could have afforded us.I don't want to `know'.Naomi Watts is a stunning and very capable actress, and I adore her here.  She doesn't raise any bars, because there are none to be raised, but she brings her natural talent to the table in full force, which is always edible.  The real standout here is the ridiculously creepy Daveigh Chase who just sinks her teeth into the role of the `ghost' here.  What she does with a simple stare is beyond nightmare inducing.She is terrifying.There are many who claim this film is a preposterous and confusing mess, and there are probably equal amounts who claim it to be supernatural perfection.  I totally buy into the fact that it is confusing, but it is near perfection when you consider the genre and the intensity it is able to build with its ever reaching premise.  When you factor in the visual style, which is magnetic to the sight, you have a film that nails a lot of what makes this genre so special.It scares the pants off of you.",5,Secrets never stay buried for long...,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,3110,"['may', 'get', 'lot', 'flak', 'calling', 'out', 'Mothman', 'Prophesies', 'feeling', 'incomplete', 'then', 'kind', 'gushing', 'Ring', 'are', 'stark', 'differences', 'two', 'First', 'nothing', 'Ring', 'feels', 'incomplete', 'Incoherent', 'maybe', 'never', 'incomplete', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'crafted', 'delivered', 'particular', 'film', 'feels', 'BELONGS', 'there', 'Yes', 'will', 'turn', 'off', 'television', 'screen', 'ponder', 'yourself', 'truth', 'strange', 'ending', 'will', 'never', 'doubt', 'filmmaker', 'credibility', 'sick', 'sense', 'closure', 'Ring', ""n't"", 'found', 'Mothman', 'Prophesies', 'think', 'professing', 'be', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'Mothman', 'Prophesies', 'more', 'accountable', 'flaws.Reality', 'should', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'what', 'growing', 'public', 'expects.Okay', 'now', 'got', 'way', 'time', 'delve', 'depths', ""Ring'."", 'Ring', 'basically', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'throws', 'panic', 'son', 'video', 'death', 'seven', 'days', 'Knowing', 'do', 'something', 'even', 'nothing', 'do', 'solve', 'mystery', 'video', 'responsible', 'killing', 'niece', 'Naturally', 'woman', 'reporter', 'so', 'better', 'chance', 'getting', 'bottom', 'things', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'bottom', 'things', 'pretty', 'deep', 'deep', 'pool', 'well', 'will', 'further', 'explanation.Yes', 'will', 'scratch', 'head', 'little.I', 'film', 'attempting', 'explain', 'open-ended', 'ending', 'create', 'sense', 'tension', 'room', 'even', 'film', 'over', 'actually', 'commend', 'film', 'everyone', 'seeking', 'further', 'answers', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'contented', 'films', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'creating', 'unfathomable', 'mystery', 'origins', 'video', 'purpose', 'remain', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'texture', 'overall', 'complexities', 'presented', 'films', 'conclusion', 'anything', 'simple', 'explanation', 'could', 'have', 'afforded', 'us.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', ""know'.Naomi"", 'Watts', 'stunning', 'very', 'capable', 'actress', 'adore', 'here', ""n't"", 'raise', 'bars', 'are', 'none', 'be', 'raised', 'natural', 'talent', 'table', 'full', 'force', 'always', 'edible', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'ridiculously', 'creepy', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'who', 'just', 'teeth', 'role', 'ghost', 'here', 'What', 'simple', 'stare', 'nightmare', 'inducing.She', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'claim', 'film', 'preposterous', 'confusing', 'mess', 'are', 'probably', 'equal', 'amounts', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'supernatural', 'perfection', 'totally', 'buy', 'fact', 'confusing', 'near', 'perfection', 'when', 'consider', 'genre', 'intensity', 'able', 'build', 'ever', 'reaching', 'premise', 'When', 'factor', 'visual', 'style', 'magnetic', 'sight', 'have', 'film', 'lot', 'what', 'genre', 'so', 'special.It', 'pants']",N/A
606341,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00005JLTK,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[5, 6]","I know there will be some misguided souls who stumble into a showing of THE RING believing that it's either a film of Richard Wagner's famous operatic cycle, or has something to do with Hobbits. Needless to say, they will be in for a surprise.Gore Verbinski's THE RING, based on an extremely popular Japanese film and novel, is a creepy and disturbing thriller that may do for VCRs what JAWS did for the ocean. After watching a recent sneak preview, I couldn't help but imagine people all across the nation going home and throwing out their videocassettes and players, in fear that they might accidentally watch the tape that's at the center of this movie.The fast-paced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legend-type set up: two high school girls - Katie and Becca - are alone in Katie's home at night. Conversation turns to a videotape that has a horrifying effect. Moments after you watch it, the phone rings, and a voice tells you, ""Seven days."" And exactly a week later, you die. Katie reveals to her friend that she watched that tape at a cabin in the woods, seven days before. In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn, Katie meets her fate, and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.Katie's aunt, a newspaper reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts), is asked by her sister Ruth (Lindsay Frost) to investigate the death, and she soon finds herself drawn into a world that's as dark and claustrophobic as the grave. Pulled in with her are former boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson), and their son Aidan (David Dorfman).We see the tape in question early on, and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images - a ring of light that looks like a solar eclipse, dead horses floating in water, a woman leaping from a cliff, a fly buzzing, a stone wall that encloses a well - playing out like a home movie made by David Lynch and Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. As the film progresses, however, we learn that the eerie black-and-white vignettes are clues to who made the tape and why. I'd hate to give away too much, so I'll just say that the answer takes Noah and Rachel to an island where a horse breeder (marvelously played by Brian Cox, the original and best Hannibal Lecter) seems to be hiding a secret that's by turns sad, and horrifying.The acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout, with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures all-too-often found in horror films and creating realistic, intriguing people. Here she (Naomi Watts) proves once again that she's an outstanding actress. Martin Henderson, another actor from Down Under, is perfect as a videographer turned reluctant action hero, and young David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are scary-good. Amber Tamblyn (daughter of multitalented actor/singer/dancer Russ Tamblyn) and the engaging Rachael Bella do a wonderful job of starting the movie off with a scream, Lindsay Frost shines in a small but important role, and Jane Alexander (an actor's actor) is fun to watch as a doctor who knows more than she wants to. The direction is crisp, stylish, and sure-handed (hard to believe that this is the same guy who helmed MOUSE TRAP and THE MEXICAN). Even the lighting and sound are beautifully worked out; those elements make a sequence with a horse on a ferry especially chilling. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack hits all the right notes, and the screenplay is smart, original, and pulls no punches. It's worth noting that unlike most modern horror films, you won't see people terrorized with knives or other conventional weapons, and there's very little actual gore. What you do see, however, as well as what's implied, may give you the worst case of the creeps you've ever had. I'm sure that some purists who've seen the original Japanese film (which spawned sequels and a TV series) will pick apart this version, but, for my money, this is one case where the remake of a foreign film can stand on its own merits.If you love being scared, grab a hold of Verbinski's THE RING and hang on for the ride of your life.",5,"the American ""Ringu"" does more than enough to stand on its own",1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,4040,"['know', 'will', 'be', 'misguided', 'souls', 'who', 'stumble', 'showing', 'THE', 'RING', 'believing', 'film', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'famous', 'operatic', 'cycle', 'something', 'do', 'Hobbits', 'Needless', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'surprise.Gore', 'Verbinski', 'THE', 'RING', 'based', 'extremely', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'film', 'novel', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'thriller', 'may', 'do', 'VCRs', 'what', 'JAWS', 'did', 'ocean', 'watching', 'recent', 'sneak', 'preview', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'people', 'nation', 'going', 'home', 'throwing', 'out', 'videocassettes', 'players', 'fear', 'might', 'accidentally', 'watch', 'tape', 'center', 'movie.The', 'fast-paced', 'suspense', 'film', 'Seattle', 'urban', 'legend-type', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'Katie', 'Becca', 'are', 'alone', 'Katie', 'home', 'night', 'Conversation', 'videotape', 'horrifying', 'effect', 'Moments', 'watch', 'phone', 'rings', 'voice', 'tells', 'Seven', 'days', 'exactly', 'week', 'later', 'die', 'Katie', 'friend', 'watched', 'tape', 'cabin', 'woods', 'seven', 'days', 'before', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'sequence', 'sure', 'make', 'drop', 'popcorn', 'Katie', 'fate', 'learn', 'tale', 'tape', 'mere', 'kids', 'story.Katie', 'aunt', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'named', 'Rachel', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'asked', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'Lindsay', 'Frost', 'investigate', 'death', 'soon', 'drawn', 'world', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'grave', 'Pulled', 'are', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Noah', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'son', 'Aidan', 'David', 'Dorfman', '.We', 'see', 'tape', 'question', 'early', 'first', 'be', 'just', 'random', 'series', 'weird', 'images', 'ring', 'light', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'dead', 'horses', 'floating', 'water', 'woman', 'leaping', 'cliff', 'fly', 'buzzing', 'stone', 'wall', 'well', 'playing', 'out', 'home', 'movie', 'made', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Luis', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'film', 'however', 'learn', 'eerie', 'black-and-white', 'vignettes', 'are', 'clues', 'who', 'made', 'tape', 'why', ""'d"", 'hate', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'answer', 'Noah', 'Rachel', 'island', 'where', 'horse', 'breeder', 'marvelously', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'original', 'best', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'be', 'hiding', 'secret', 'turns', 'sad', 'horrifying.The', 'acting', 'THE', 'RING', 'fabulous', 'actors', 'stretching', 'well', 'caricatures', 'all-too-often', 'found', 'horror', 'films', 'creating', 'realistic', 'intriguing', 'people', 'Here', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'once', 'again', 'outstanding', 'actress', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'actor', 'Down', 'perfect', 'videographer', 'turned', 'reluctant', 'action', 'hero', 'young', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'are', 'scary-good', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'daughter', 'multitalented', 'actor/singer/dancer', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'engaging', 'Rachael', 'Bella', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'starting', 'movie', 'scream', 'Lindsay', 'Frost', 'shines', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'actor', 'actor', 'fun', 'watch', 'doctor', 'who', 'more', 'direction', 'crisp', 'stylish', 'sure-handed', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'helmed', 'MOUSE', 'TRAP', 'THE', 'MEXICAN', 'Even', 'lighting', 'sound', 'are', 'beautifully', 'worked', 'out', 'elements', 'make', 'sequence', 'horse', 'ferry', 'especially', 'chilling', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'soundtrack', 'right', 'notes', 'screenplay', 'smart', 'original', 'punches', 'worth', 'noting', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'people', 'terrorized', 'knives', 'other', 'conventional', 'weapons', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'gore', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'however', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'implied', 'may', 'give', 'worst', 'case', 'creeps', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', ""'m"", 'sure', 'purists', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Japanese', 'film', 'spawned', 'sequels', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'pick', 'apart', 'version', 'money', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'remake', 'foreign', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merits.If', 'love', 'being', 'scared', 'grab', 'hold', 'Verbinski', 'THE', 'RING', 'hang', 'ride', 'life']",N/A

Not because I think it's better, but because it's more my kind of movie. Ringu relies heavily on an understanding of Japanese culture and mysticism, and so a lot of it went way over my head. The Ring caters to my need to have things make sense in the end, even if all questions aren't answered. Too much didn't make sense to me about Ringu. To me, the scariest part of horror movies is when the Awful Realization hits you- the Rosebud moment. That moment never really came with Ringu for me, but it did with The Ring. Also, the cinematography in The Ring, as well as the music, the grisly but brief shocks and the false-bottom ending all came together into a very disturbing experience that kept bothering me for days after I watched it. Now I've seen it enough times so it doesn't freak me out as much, but I'm always left uncomfortable and paranoid after a viewing.

The trouble is, the more horror films I see, the less they manage to actually frighten me. And, to me, that's rather the whole point.Resident Evil got my vote not because the zombies were scary, but because it had some good shocks and nice action. The Ring is a very different type of movie, closer to horror than action.From the very first scene of the movie the eerie atmosphere is set very well. If you're actually watching the movie, it's near impossible not to get into the creepy mood. Even if you're just waiting for ""it"" to happen, whatever it may be. The movie makes it quite clear, it will happen, and you do not know what it is. It's a really refreshing take from recent films where the villian is obvious.I've heard numerous reports of people losing sleep over this movie and having trouble leaving it at the theater. I can't say I found it frightening to that level, but it still managed to send a good chill down my spine throughout the film and startle me a number of times. I was shaking a bit coming out of the theater, I'm hoping it's because it was rather cold. ^_^;The horror is broken up from time to time with interesting and entertaining exploration and story development. However, just when you think the movie is switching from a horror flick to an interesting mystery flick, the horror elements return, in force.Although parts of the movie are somewhat corny, and many reports of the movie are of course over hyped, you will indeed at least be creeped out and entertained throughout. It's certainly worth seeing, and I'd recommend seeing it with a friend. You'll have a hard time not giving away the details if you don't.And if you like to bring a gullible, easily scared girl to the movies with you, don't be surprised if you end up jumping a few times yourself. ^_^ Don't worry, your friends who have seen it as well won't laugh at you... too much.- Rirath_com",5,First really scary horror film in ages.,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,2014,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Ring', 'last', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'started', 'become', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'trouble', 'more', 'horror', 'films', 'see', 'less', 'manage', 'actually', 'frighten', 'rather', 'whole', 'point.Resident', 'Evil', 'got', 'vote', 'not', 'zombies', 'were', 'scary', 'had', 'good', 'shocks', 'nice', 'action', 'Ring', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'closer', 'horror', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'very', 'well', ""'re"", 'actually', 'watching', 'movie', 'impossible', 'not', 'get', 'creepy', 'mood', 'Even', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'happen', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'quite', 'clear', 'will', 'happen', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'refreshing', 'take', 'recent', 'films', 'where', 'villian', 'obvious.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'numerous', 'reports', 'people', 'losing', 'sleep', 'movie', 'having', 'trouble', 'leaving', 'theater', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'frightening', 'level', 'still', 'managed', 'send', 'good', 'chill', 'down', 'spine', 'film', 'startle', 'number', 'times', 'was', 'shaking', 'bit', 'coming', 'theater', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'was', 'rather', 'cold', '^_^', 'horror', 'broken', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'exploration', 'story', 'development', 'However', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'switching', 'horror', 'flick', 'interesting', 'mystery', 'flick', 'horror', 'return', 'force.Although', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'many', 'reports', 'movie', 'are', 'course', 'hyped', 'will', 'indeed', 'least', 'be', 'creeped', 'out', 'entertained', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'friend', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'details', ""don't.And"", 'like', 'bring', 'gullible', 'easily', 'scared', 'girl', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'end', 'up', 'jumping', 'few', 'times', '^_^', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'too', 'much.-', 'Rirath_com']",N/A

I think it is completley uproarious when people think that a PG-13 film will possess chills down the spine. I thought this movie was loaded with alot of cheap scares and I think the suspense was the only factor in this film that possesed any scary moments. The plot was very unexplained and didn't really make alot of sense. Also anything that they felt they could build any suspense off of they did it. For example why was it so important to not explain that Naomi Watts friend was the father of her child? The plot is so thin that they take little things like that to keep you going and it turns out to be insignificant. Why was Samara evil? Why did she enjoy what she was doing? How did she have the power to proceed with these actions after death? I suppose the tape was basically a channel or outsource for her to pick and get to her victims? I really don't understand it was a really strange idea to be conceived. But I will say that I like the direction of the film and the hazy cinematography that it conveyed. Which definitley gave it that erie boast to help support its plot. Basically though I think I am a bit more supportive of this film because Naomi Watts is in it. Every since 2001's Mulholland Dr, I have been somewhat of a fan of her work. But anyway I am not going to ramble on about this film. If you are one of those that will easily get scared this is the project for you other wise just enjoy the suspense of this film and the visuals. I don't really know alot about the japanese Ringu, but it has to be more violent than this film I will definitley have to check it out.Arish",4,The Ring?,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,1706,"['When', 'read', 'box', 'saw', 'rating', 'was', 'PG-13', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', 'how', 'horrifying', 'can', 'be', 'think', 'completley', 'uproarious', 'when', 'people', 'think', 'PG-13', 'film', 'will', 'possess', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'loaded', 'alot', 'cheap', 'scares', 'think', 'suspense', 'was', 'only', 'factor', 'film', 'possesed', 'scary', 'moments', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'unexplained', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'alot', 'sense', 'Also', 'anything', 'felt', 'could', 'build', 'suspense', 'off', 'did', 'example', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'not', 'explain', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'friend', 'was', 'father', 'child', 'plot', 'so', 'thin', 'take', 'little', 'things', 'keep', 'going', 'out', 'be', 'insignificant', 'Why', 'was', 'Samara', 'evil', 'Why', 'did', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'How', 'did', 'have', 'power', 'proceed', 'actions', 'death', 'suppose', 'tape', 'was', 'basically', 'channel', 'outsource', 'pick', 'get', 'victims', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'really', 'strange', 'idea', 'be', 'conceived', 'will', 'say', 'like', 'direction', 'film', 'hazy', 'cinematography', 'conveyed', 'Which', 'gave', 'boast', 'help', 'support', 'plot', 'Basically', 'think', 'am', 'bit', 'more', 'supportive', 'film', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Every', '2001', 'Mulholland', 'Dr', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'fan', 'work', 'anyway', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'ramble', 'film', 'are', 'one', 'will', 'easily', 'get', 'scared', 'project', 'other', 'wise', 'just', 'enjoy', 'suspense', 'film', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'alot', 'japanese', 'Ringu', 'be', 'more', 'violent', 'film', 'will', 'definitley', 'have', 'check', 'out.Arish']",N/A

606358,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JLTK,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 5]","Engulfed in dark, dreary images, filled with wet and foggy visuals, and a chilling tone, director Gore Verbinskicreates one of the moodiest, and most effective thrillers to invade our heads in a long time. He creates such an intriguing and cold-like world, that you can't help but feel the chill of the thrilling events unfolding before your very eyes. The story is chillingly and well conceived by screenwriter Ehren Krueger(""Scream 3""), and really takes you for a ride. The film begins with a solid intro that at first seems like it could be the beginning of any recent teen horror films, but it quickly turns and you realize that this isn't anything like it. We learn the story in these first few minutes of a bizarre tape. A tape that is so horrible and mind blowing that it eventually causes your death. After you watch it, you get a strange call with a voice on the other end whispering ""seven days"", and in that week's time, your gone. We then meet Seattle reporter Rachel(played by the strong and breathtakingly gorgeous Naomi Watts), and her little son Aidan, wonderfully and engaginly portrayed by young David Dorfman. Asked by her sister to look into the cause of a family tragedy, Rachel discovers the shocking tape and quickly descends into a mission to find out what the tape is all about, who are the people in it, and why the people who watch it die seven days afterwards. Aiding her in her mission is her friend Noah, played by Martin Henderson. Veteran actor Brian Cox, who was the first Hannibal Lecter in 1986's ""Manhunter"", also appears in the film as a man who may or may not know some of the tape's secrets. As I have already mentioned, Verbinksi fills his film with striking visuals and images that stay with you long after the film ends. He knows how to make everything in a scene work, and play it for all it's worth. The guy knows his way around a scare and how to set the right mood and atmosphere. If this is how he does thrillers, then we can only be so lucky that he does more, as it would definitley make him a fantastic force of nature in the genre. Seattle, and the surrounding areas, is where the film takes place. I live a little ways away from the city, but the place is like a second home to me because I go there so much and have family who live there. Everyone knows about the rain Seattle gets, so seeing it as wet and depressing as it was in this movie was no real surprise. I do wonder if this really was just typical Seattle weather, or if some of the rain and wetness was created by Hollywood instead of mother nature. The actors here are all game and really give it their all. I was the most impressed with young Dorfman. I am not sure how old he is, but he was very appealing and had good screen presence. This kid was good. Watts, a vision of total beauty, tackles her role with strength and intelligence and makes it real. Cox has a rather short role, but he makes them memorable. Sometimes the small roles are like that. While it is obvious that some people don't like, or get, these types of movies(just read some of the negative reviews for that), I enjoy them because they don't just flash some kind of gore or eye candy with virtually no story or a single scene of suspense or chills like some horror films and certain thrillers. Some people don't want to think or get to involved in a story, and just want the good stuff like in slasher films. Unfortunatley, this film did get a backlash like that once it got so popular and successful, which was expected. Oh well. I am glad I wasn't swayed by those reviews and finally saw a film that I had thought would of been really good and boy was I not disappointed.

606367,A2SXT52GWYQX68,B00005JLTK,B. M. Banzon,"[3, 5]","I have always puzzled over criticisms that this film is a soulless cash-in of a superior Japanese horror film, intended for low attention-span teenagers. While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own, it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story, adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.The Japanese RING is effective because of the stark realism and dry terror it evokes; the remake takes the opposite route, taking on a nightmarish and surreal atmosphere. While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity, THE RING creeps forward with a languid, contemplative pace. Criticisms for being ""slow"" are inevitable, but to those who can appreciate it, THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes. One is not likely to forget the shot of the well, bathed in blue, or the leaves lighting up ""as if they were on fire."" But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart. Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape, replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions, and scandal with tragedy. Kruger also adds layers to the film, introducing arcing themes about parental responsiblity, the needs of children, and empathy.Parenthood is examined in a number of places in the film. Naomi Watts' character, a crass and insensitive journalist, is also an uncaring mother, not wanting to acknowledge the distance between her and her son. Martin Henderson's Noah is a deadbeat dad, afraid of taking responsibility of the child. Jane Alexander, as the Moesko Island doctor, talks to Watts about her mentally retarded grandson. ""We loved him anyway,"" she says. ""It takes work. Some people have limits."" She is indirectly talking about the Morgans, whose daughter shows us the worst-case scenario of becoming a parent. The extent to which they go when dealing with their child is horrifying. Aidan and Samara have a subtle relationship in that they are both victims of parents struggling with their role as parents. It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother, and the empathy she creates with the plight of the neglected daughter Samara Morgan ultimately reflects on her own son. Naomi Watts does a fine job of showing the growth her character makes, conveying real sadness and sensitivity as the film progresses, especially in the final scene. The look in her face when the movie ""fades to black,"" so to speak, hits home the moral crisis the film ends with.There is a lot more to this film than one would think. The final climax with the television has its own dark edge, even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out. The final scene brings up a moral dilemma, though, that rivals the original in resonance.For added insight, watch the DON'T WATCH THIS feature on the DVD.

Ridiculous. The Exorcist is a much scarier film than this. Maybe its just becasue I had heard so much about it that i didnt find it too scary intitially, but a couple scenes were just hilarious (im thinking of the ones with the horse and the old guy electrocuting himself, both of which were supposed to be scary,) This certaintly isnt the scariest movie ever.Now that being said, I will say that this movie is scary. Not the scariest film ever. But effectively creepy. Gore Verbinski is generally good at building suspense, and The little girl in it is pretty freaky, even though this whole 'Sinister and/or mysterious children' thing is kind of a cliche in horror movies. Psychological?...I guess, but it could have been more so.The scene where the videotape is shown to the audience wasnt so scary for me, maybe because i had already viewed it online months earlier on some upcoming movies site (no,I didnt get a phone call), thought the first time I saw it I was fairly spooked. The film moved at a good pace and was interesting and enough to keep me from never being bored, and it was cool how it eventually turned into a sort of family drama and the the very end was unexpecedly artsy. There were too many false endings before it though.I wanna see the japanese version, cause ive heard its scarier.All in all, I'd give this film about 31/2 stars if possible, but I decided to go with four.

Four teenagers watch the tape and they all die at exactly 10:00. Then, a reporter tries to figure out how they died. You see a freaky image one of the dead ones and then the reporter swipes the video. She watches it and has 7 days to live.

606371,A2OV92BM57J94R,B00005JLTK,"Brandon Whitfeld ""caulfield0""","[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that I did not see the 1998 Japanese cult horror flick, RINGU, from which this film was re-made. That's a different film from a different country: get over it. This movie is very scary, extremely well-crafted, but ultimately something of a mess. It was also my distinct impression that this is a film most effective on the big screen (I did not see it in the theaters).For those of you who saw the abysmal FEARDOTCOM, this movie is really the same idea right down to the creepy little dead girl who can't seem to stay dead; instead of a website that kills you in a week, it's a videotape. Can you make that adjustment, people? However, THE RING is a much better film, although amusingly enough, fails ultimately for the same reasons.The best part about THE RING is its dynamic cinematography, brooding atmosphere, and unsettling mood. It is superbly shot: The movie looks and feels like you're viewing it through an aquarium after midnight. It is always raining in this mis-en-scene, and that coupled with its smoky, steely, lonely backdrops made me realize, once again, how strangely influential the Brad Pitt classic, SE7EN, has been on these types of films. Another major plus: the attractive, straight-from-the-outback leads do solid work. Naomi Watts is lovely, and screams better than any horror heroine I've seen in quite some time. The excellent character actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also turn up here, breathing some more life into all this creepiness.THE RING does extremely well with fractured, nightmarish dreamscapes, bold startling images that burn themselves on your retina. In this way, THE RING references the little known but actually pretty scary Robert Downey, Jr.-Annette Bening supernatural caper, IN DREAMS, and the visual artist Joel Peter Witkin, who inspired all those NINE INCH NAILS videos. The movie is genuinely frightening without resorting to much violence or gore. It maintains its tension throughout, and in this way is similar to both SIGNS and the MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, both of which are better films. It also has an unexplainably deadpan little boy who looks prophetic and miserable, babbles precocious nonsense, and in this way references THE SIXTH SENSE. The movie also begins with an unsettling, un-ironic prologue that gives you really no idea where this movie is headed. This prologue doesn't even apologize for imitating SCREAM.There are some truly stunning sequences: the escaped horse on the ferry, the ghostly searching of that lighthouse in the abandoned farmhouse, poor Naomi trapped in that well, but ultimately this horror-mystery-art film goes nowhere. It is scary, fun to watch, builds momentum, but makes no sense at the end, so in this way pays tribute to the most talked about cult horror-mystery film of late, DONNIE DARKO.I was truly disappointed, ultimately. THE RING was doing so well for me, but one false ending later it had left too many unanswered questions (i.e. for those of you who have seen this: how DID ole Anna Morgan conceive her devil child?), loose ends (what's the source of creepy little boy's psychic link to creepy little girl?), and some terrible TERRIBLE plot holes, which makes everything you've just seen lose credibility. So instead of a glossy horror-mystery-art film, you'll realize all you've been watching all along is a BAD MTV VIDEO.One further note: the DVD isn't exactly jam-packed with extras. It's structured well, looks great naturally, and has a clever set-up for the deleted scenes. But, like the film, could have tried harder to do more.",3,7 Days Later....,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,3562,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'did', 'not', 'see', '1998', 'Japanese', 'cult', 'horror', 'flick', 'RINGU', 'film', 'was', 're-made', 'different', 'film', 'different', 'country', 'get', 'movie', 'very', 'scary', 'extremely', 'well-crafted', 'ultimately', 'something', 'mess', 'was', 'also', 'distinct', 'impression', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'big', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'theaters', '.For', 'who', 'saw', 'abysmal', 'FEARDOTCOM', 'movie', 'really', 'same', 'idea', 'right', 'down', 'creepy', 'little', 'dead', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'dead', 'instead', 'website', 'week', 'videotape', 'Can', 'make', 'adjustment', 'people', 'However', 'THE', 'RING', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'amusingly', 'enough', 'ultimately', 'same', 'reasons.The', 'best', 'part', 'THE', 'RING', 'dynamic', 'cinematography', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'unsettling', 'mood', 'superbly', 'shot', 'movie', 'feels', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'aquarium', 'midnight', 'always', 'raining', 'mis-en-scene', 'coupled', 'smoky', 'steely', 'lonely', 'made', 'realize', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'strangely', 'influential', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'classic', 'SE7EN', 'been', 'types', 'films', 'major', 'plus', 'attractive', 'straight-from-the-outback', 'leads', 'do', 'solid', 'work', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'lovely', 'screams', 'better', 'horror', 'heroine', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'excellent', 'character', 'actors', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'also', 'turn', 'up', 'here', 'breathing', 'more', 'life', 'creepiness.THE', 'RING', 'extremely', 'well', 'fractured', 'nightmarish', 'dreamscapes', 'bold', 'startling', 'images', 'burn', 'retina', 'way', 'THE', 'RING', 'little', 'known', 'actually', 'pretty', 'scary', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.-Annette', 'Bening', 'supernatural', 'caper', 'IN', 'DREAMS', 'visual', 'artist', 'Joel', 'Peter', 'Witkin', 'who', 'inspired', 'NINE', 'INCH', 'NAILS', 'videos', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'resorting', 'much', 'violence', 'gore', 'tension', 'way', 'similar', 'SIGNS', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'also', 'unexplainably', 'deadpan', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'prophetic', 'miserable', 'precocious', 'nonsense', 'way', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'movie', 'also', 'unsettling', 'un-ironic', 'prologue', 'really', 'idea', 'where', 'movie', 'headed', 'prologue', ""n't"", 'even', 'apologize', 'imitating', 'SCREAM.There', 'are', 'truly', 'stunning', 'sequences', 'escaped', 'horse', 'ferry', 'ghostly', 'searching', 'lighthouse', 'abandoned', 'farmhouse', 'poor', 'Naomi', 'trapped', 'well', 'ultimately', 'horror-mystery-art', 'film', 'nowhere', 'scary', 'fun', 'watch', 'builds', 'momentum', 'sense', 'end', 'so', 'way', 'tribute', 'most', 'talked', 'cult', 'horror-mystery', 'film', 'late', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO.I', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'ultimately', 'RING', 'was', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'false', 'ending', 'later', 'had', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'i.e', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'how', 'DID', 'ole', 'Anna', 'Morgan', 'conceive', 'devil', 'child', 'loose', 'ends', 'what', 'source', 'creepy', 'little', 'boy', 'psychic', 'link', 'creepy', 'little', 'girl', 'terrible', 'TERRIBLE', 'plot', 'holes', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'lose', 'credibility', 'So', 'instead', 'glossy', 'horror-mystery-art', 'film', ""'ll"", 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'along', 'BAD', 'MTV', 'VIDEO.One', 'further', 'note', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'jam-packed', 'extras', 'structured', 'well', 'great', 'naturally', 'clever', 'set-up', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'harder', 'do', 'more']",N/A

For that, I'll only give it four stars, because aside from these flaws, this was a seriously creepy movie. I thought it was infinitely scarier and more believable than the ridiculous &quot;Signs.&quot; I agree with many of the comparisons people have made with &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; Aside from the fact that cute, seemingly harmless little girls feature prominently in both stories, &quot;The Ring&quot; resembles &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in its dark, malevolent mood. Like &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; this is a horror movie blissfully free of blood and gore. The horror of this film comes from hints at things unseen and incredibly disturbing imagery. I've heard many people complain about the twist ending- indeed, it would have been fine with me if the film had ended fifteen minutes earlier. I will say that this ending, unecessary as it might have been, provides one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen on film. I found Naomi Watts to be wonderful in this role, almost as impressive as her part in &quot;Mulholland Drive.&quot; She really held this movie together for me, because I wasn't particularly enamoured with the other actors (not to say that they were bad).

606374,A36WS7A1CHIB4B,B00005JLTK,"Brooke Pennington ""Renaissance girl""","[1, 3]","""The Ring"" is best viewed for its subconsciously affecting elements.  Anytime the film strays into an area where logic is required, it falters.  But the chills which it provides are quite intense, if you'll let them be.The film's plot, which need not be summarized here in great detail since others have done it before and better, concerns a videotape which kills its viewers in seven days.  Our heroine is a journalist trying to keep the tape from killing herself and her son.  Now, the first truly frightening part of this film is that killer videotape itself.  Using a mixture of elements lifted from Freudian psychology and inserted into frightening settings, it is quite disturbing in a way that is hard to pin down.  What, exactly, is so sinister about a ladder leaning against a blank wall?  Or a woman slowly brushing her hair?  Somehow these mundane elements become subtly chilling.  Stylistically the video resembles Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" but uses such a surreal effect to much more disturbing ends.  Whereas Bunuel's film was just calculated weirdness, the killer videotape might stay with you when you try to fall asleep at night after seeing this film.The other disturbing elements play on subconscious fears that many viewers are probably not aware that they have.  For example, in modern society it is very easy to go a lifetime without confronting the terrifying situations of being trapped in a well or chased by a maverick horse.  But once we see these situations, we respond with a primal terror.  It is in visceral thrills like these that ""The Ring"" excels.Its logical abilities are somewhat more impaired.  The film spends too much time trying to tie up loose ends, but in the process points our attention to the questions that are left unanswered.  Many classic horror movies explain themselves away in the end, but they do so fully, in a way that makes the audience say, ""Ah!  I understand why that happened now!""  ""The Ring"" simply leaves us saying, ""Okay, so that's why THAT happened, but what about THIS?  How can THIS be explained?""  The strengths of this film lie in its visual effects (the villainess is truly creepy, when she finally appears).  I suggest taking the film at face value, renting it for a teenage slumber party, or renting it for a night at home with a date.  Perhaps a little wine or other intoxicant would eliminate some of the glaring plot holes for some viewers.Regarding the DVD features, there are not too many.  But the deleted scenes montage is quite well-done.  Gore Verbinksi has taken deleted scenes and intercut them with necessary moments from the finished film, creating a ""shortened"" version of the original film that uses the deleted scenes in place of transitional scenes that made the final cut.  I feel that some of the scenes which made the final cut could have been left out in favor of some deleted scenes which enriched the background story, but that is my opinion.  At any rate, the deleted scenes are worth checking out.  The preview for the Japanese original version of the film make it seem exactly like the American version, which I'm sure it isn't really.  But it does give you an idea of what the Japanese version looks like.  Overall, watch the film and the bonus features once.  Let it scare the pants off you.

606375,A1FTOX0CKR4DW7,B00005JLTK,Bruno S.,"[1, 2]","Going into The Ring directed by Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) I did not know what to expect. I have heard mostly negative things about the film, so I was expecting a movie that was cheap on thrills and poorly directed. I was in for a total shock. The Ring is a creepy, well directed movie.The opening sequence is pretty much an homage to the movie ""Scream."" Ehren Kreuger, The Ring's writer wrote Scream 3. From the opening sequence the movie hooked me. I will not give it away, but I was actually on the edge of my seat wondering what the hell was going to happen. After this well directed opening sequence, we get into the real story. Naomi Watts, an actress that should be really famous already, plays a reporter named Rachel. After a death, Rachel investigates the mysterious circumstances around the death and discovers a video tape.The less you know going in the better. So in order to not to ruin anything don't read the next paragraph....**This tape is weird. It has images of disembowelment, which is a quick flash cut. A crazy lady, and a weird little girl. If you watch it, as soon as it's over you get a phone call saying you have 7 days to live. Some weird, creepy, and somewhat scary stuff.Rachel watches it, and becomes marked for death by the unknown reaper. Now she has to race the clock to find out who's behind the tape**Here's the bottom line....I liked this film alot! The middle needed some tightening and maybe a couple more knee jerk scares. But I was cool with the movie as a whole. The ending, which is what a lot of people I spoke with before hand didn't like, was good. The audience clapped, and of course it left it open for a sequel, or sequels I should say. The movie is really creepy, and since I'm not scared easily, I wasn't scared, just along for this ride not knowing what to expect. I have been desensitized by horror flicks so I'm not easily scared. I was happy to see that this movie was not disrespectful to the Horror Genre. It could have easily been another ""Bless The Child"" or something along that line. It wasn't.The Good.....Naomi Watts is wonderful. She should be famous already, and the camera loves her.The Direction is good. Gore Verbinski's direction is tight, clean, and suspenseful without too much gore.The Writing is good, Ehren Krueger makes up for Scream 3The Imagery is creepy.The Bad....Middle part is a bit long.The Mother-Son relationship between Watts and The Weird Kid who played her son wasn't too convincing.The actor who played her son seemed like he went to the Haley Joel Osment knockoff school of acting.One more death scene would have made me satisfied completely.Worth the money?

Dont under estimate the scariness, of this movie. Trust me it may not seem scary until the very end. Some of the thoughts that it drives into your head, the disturbing images it displays. It also can give people a paranoia about telephones. This movie is definately not for children, do not let any of your kids watch it if you dont think that they are ready.

At first it is a joke but when it comes down to it she wasn't lying and she gets killed. It turns out that Naomi Watts is her aunt and the mother of the girl asks her to find out what is going on. Naomi unwillingly accepts, she starts to investigate. It turns out that her niece's boyfriend died at the same time. So Naomi begins to ask around where the girl had been. When all of her sources lead her to a roadside cabin motel she puts her life in danger by watching the same tape. They have seven days to live.She shows one person the tape, her ex-boyfriend. They decide to find out what it is all about. They trace the tape all the way back to where was made and try to stop the tape from killing people and find out why it was made.

Furthermore, Verbinski has pasted in a number of irrelevant scenes, which are little more than an irritating distraction, whilst skipping over some of the more atmospheric scenes from the original.Sure the movie is still an effective and thought-provoking horror, but that is entirely due to the magnificence of the original.Even the famous shock ending seems rushed here and feels spoiled.I'm afraid this merely reinforces my view that remakes are, almost without exception, (John Carpenter's The Thing being the exception) inferior to the original.",2,Disappointing and pointless remake of horror classic,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,866,"['Whilst', 'Verbinski', 'remake', 'Nakata', 'classic', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'mixing', 'few', 'anachronistic', 'elements', 'Ring', '2', 'Ring', '0', 'clearly', 'visceral', 'impact', 'original.Firstly', 'switching', 'locale', 'Japan', 'Seattle', 'greatly', 'atmosphere', 'rather', 'overall', 'effect', 'Furthermore', 'Verbinski', 'pasted', 'number', 'irrelevant', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'irritating', 'distraction', 'whilst', 'skipping', 'more', 'atmospheric', 'scenes', 'original.Sure', 'movie', 'still', 'effective', 'thought-provoking', 'horror', 'entirely', 'due', 'magnificence', 'original.Even', 'famous', 'shock', 'ending', 'rushed', 'here', 'feels', 'spoiled.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'merely', 'view', 'remakes', 'are', 'almost', 'exception', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', 'being', 'exception', 'inferior', 'original']",N/A

There are only a few movies that have had me peeking through my fingers as I watched it. &quot;The Ring&quot; is one of them. You probably already know the plot, so I'll just tell you what the actual movie is like.  Every scene seems to be important or have some frightening part. Even though the discussion at the beginning of the movie isn't even supposed to be scary (about television waves), I already had the creeps. Know why? It was too quiet. There wasn't any background music, there wasn't ANYTHING. Just two teenage girls talking to each other. You never know when something's going to jump out at you. This movie seems to really take advantage of that. Practically the whole movie is quiet in the background. When there is music, it sends chills down your spine. During &quot;THE TAPE&quot;, my cousin claimed to have heard &quot;Cha-ching&quot; noises in the background. I've yet to heard this, but I believe him. Everytime you see this film, you notice something new. A lot of the things you notice will scare the heck out of you, too. There are &quot;rings&quot; in a lot of scenes, for instance, when Noah picks up his coffee cup, there is a ring left on the table. I haven't seen the original movie called &quot;Ringu&quot;, but maybe it's better that I saw this one first. While a lot of movies (Scream, I know what you did last summer) seem to think that violence equals scary, &quot;The Ring&quot; takes a different path. It scares you psychologically with smart images, a unique story, and terrifying scenes. There's hardly any violence, actually. When I think of this movie, I remember myself huddling down in my theatre seat and closing my eyes. Yet, I never wanted to leave. It's great movie, that's just on the brink of comfortable scary, and a little too scary. It terrified me and everyone I saw it with. But we LOVED it! This movie somehow targets what scares you most and intensifies it for 2 hours. My cousin and I talked about it after we saw it for about an hour. It sticks with you.

The direction is not that bad, the story is awesome but unfortunatley it couldn't be kept as good for the film.I'm not a huge horror movie fan, but I do tend to watch the most I can. Prolly one of the reasons why this movie was pretty much a disapointment for me it's because of it's lack of taste of horror. This could easily be more of a thriller than anything else, because since that's not the case this movie should of been a 'Bomb' instead. There are one or two scenes that might make you gasp but nothing to be excited for it.For those who haven't seen it, see it!

You cannot call yourself a horror fan until you've watched this movie because this movie a staple for the horror movie diet.  As a background in case you want to start watching and need a plot that doesn't reveal too much:Two friends (both girls) start off the movie by having a sleep over, but when they talk about the cursed video tape, one of the girls reveals that in 7 days, you die unless you **** ** and **** ** ** ******* ****, but you'll figure that out towards the end of the movie, anyways because she didn't do that, the girl who watched the video (who's also hosting the sleepover) goes downstairs (her room is in the second floor of the house) to get something, but the TV turns on while she's downstairs so she shuts it off (only static playing), she then proceeded upstairs and when she reaches her room she sees red liquid (assumed to be blood) coming from the crack at the bottom of her bedroom door, she opens her door to see that her TV was turned on and a well was on the TV, she then puts her head up (facing the ceiling) and she dies from the curse.  The girl's cousin and her aunt then delve deeper into what caused her death and what they find is pretty shocking.  The friend from the sleepover was ghost white when found in the closet huddling (which was utterly one of those moments where it shocks you for a few seconds but then you get over it until you finish the movie where it freaks you out at night).Back to the review, most movies based off of books tend to be better than movies that appeared from thin air because they already have a story line to follow.  Plot and character details are just right so that you don't get too much of the character, but you don't get too little of each character to go off of.  The movie itself was perfect in it's own way, it really depends on how you look at the movie though, some see it as having little to no scary moments or people think it's a little overdone, I can agree that the movie was a bit much (the ring video was a bit too much, but I was only 10 or 12 when I first saw the video and was a bit scared of it), but the ending was just so that it wasn't really a typical American remake with a lot of survivors, but not a J-horror film with no survivors.  Now I cannot just keep going back and forth between good and bad moments because I'm obviously running out of bad moments, but as a last note:  how to avoid the cursed video is revealed so late in the game that there's no way that the girl in the mental ward could have told her how many days she had left because *** ******* ****** *** ****** and ****** ** ** *** ******, which is why part of the movie is flawed!  You think you solved it when really you solve it after the boy reveals something about the curse at the end of the movie!  She ****** *** ****** so early that she didn't need to do anything but **** *** **** and **** ** ** ******** that way ** **** **** **!  I censor out so whoever reads this can watch the movie and not get spoiled here, but you can't solve it until you know what our protagonist did or go to some spoiler review/site that tells you why, but the answer's pretty straight forward.

To say that this fine and extremely stylish horror film frightened me would be an understatement. This film worked beneath my skin, striking multiple chords and leaving me genuinely creeped out. Film director Gore Verbinski has done an excellent job in remaking the 1998 Japanese horror classic ""Ringu."" He was in a no-win situation, as most Hollywood directors are when trying to remake superior European/foreign films. ""Ringu"" is superior, only because it came first. But ""The Ring"" is as frightening a ghost story as you are most likely to see.And that is really all that ""The Ring"" is at heart - a ghost story. Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" another stylish ghost story enjoyed by American masses, ""The Ring"" creates an ominous, supernatural sense of doom. The dead walk among us in these two films. But the eventual difference is that in ""The Ring,"" the ghost does not particularly like the living. And there is no easy way out for the stalked protagonists.The plot, now familiar, details a mysterious videotape. When watched by unlucky viewers, they die within seven days. After the death of four teenagers, who viewed the tape following a weekend trip to a remote cabin, a Seattle newspaper reporter (the lovely Naomi Watts) investigates the case. Yes, she watches the tape, and realizes her days are numbered. The intensity level is cranked up when her son accidently views the tape himself, and now the mystery must be solved within the dreaded time.""The Ring"" succeeds because of the eerie sense of mood it creates. The images on the videotape itself are gloomy, to say the least. The Pacific Northwest locale of Seattle and the surrounding countryside (used so well in early ""X-Files"" episodes) also establishes a foreboding atmosphere. In ""The Ring,"" the skies are always overcast, the forests are forbiddingly dark and the rain continually falls. And of course, there's the ghost. I will not describe this creepy apparition, suffice to say when it does make an appearance, I found myself wanting to close my eyes and flee. It is a nightmare come to life, much like the videotape itself.To me, whispers are far more terrifying than screams.

You only see the girl kill two people, and you never actually ""see"" her do it, which angered me immensly.  Also the so called payoff ending of this movie was also dissapointing, after watching all of this amazing storyline filled movie, and figuring out all of the secrets, the best Gore Verbanski could come up with for an ending was having the girl come out of the Tv and show her move anround some guys house for a few seconds of footage?

606393,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JLTK,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[2, 2]","A remake of a Japanese film titled Ringu (1998), which I have yet to see, The Ring (2002) is a genuinely creepy tale of a cursed video, one that results in the death of anyone, within seven days, who happens to watch it...directed by Gore Verbinski, who's found a lot of success with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the film stars Naomi Watts (Ned Kelly, King Kong) as an investigative reporter who comes across the aforementioned tape after a relative dies mysteriously.  Also appearing is Martin Henderson (Smokin' Aces), David Dorfman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Jane Alexander (The Cider House Rules), Daveigh Chase (Stitch! The Movie), and Brian Cox (The Bourne Identity, X2).As the movie, set in the Seattle area, begins we see two teenage girls alone in a large house, and soon their conversation turns to the stuff urban legends are made of, specifically in terms of the existence of a video tape that, when watched, will result in a creepy phone call stating the viewer has seven days to live.  As it turns out, one of the girls just happened to have watch said tape a week ago and, well, I won't describe anymore but I will say some seriously bad mojo soon ensues as the girl who watched the tape has her chips prematurely cashed in while her friend suffers a complete mental collapse resulting her being institutionalized.  So how does Naomi Watts, who plays the character Rachel Keller, fit into it all?  Well, she just happens to be the aunt of the dead girl, along with also being an investigative reporter and a single mother of a creepy little kid named Aidan (Dorfman).  Realizing there may be a story here, especially after learning a few of her niece's friends died mysterious the same time as the girl (they all watched the tape at the same time), Rachel begins digging, eventually coming across the tape (and watching it), and soon begins to fear for her own life, with good reason.  Hoping to learn more about the images on the video, she contacts an acquaintance named Noah (Henderson), who specializes in graphic mediums, and shows him the tape (apparently it wasn't enough that she alone be cursed).  Noah's skeptical, believing it's some sort of crummy, student film but soon changes his tune as the strange vibes Rachel has been experiencing since watching the tape begin to invade his reality.  Rachel's research eventually leads her and Noah upstate to a dilapidated horse farm (that has no horses), run by a man named Richard Morgan (Cox), whose wife and daughter, both featured prominently on the tape, have since died under mysterious circumstances (seems the wife was a bit nutty, while the daughter was, well...).  Anyway, Rachel and Noah make some important revelations, ones that may help remove the `curse', that is if they don't run out of time (seven days goes by quickly when you've got the monkey of death on your back).I avoided seeing this when it originally came out, as there was so much buzz flying about, and for some reason I thought the film would be swathed in pretension.  I finally did watch it about a year and a half ago, and then again last night, and after doing so, I was very impressed.  I definitely believe this is a film in need of multiple viewings, at least for me, as the first time I saw it my focus was primarily on the ookie visuals, so much so I missed bits and pieces of the story.  Subsequently, by the end of the first go around, I wasn't entirely sure what the hell was going on, specifically in terms of the ending.  Now, in watching again last night, I tended to focus more on the story, picking up those minor, but important, elements I missed the first time around, and things made a whole lot more sense...not that I didn't feel there wasn't a plot hole or two, but nothing large enough to drive a bus through.  The story has an ever present sense of doom and gloom, partly due to the Seattle setting (Seattle is notorious for its wet weather), but also because of the material itself as I never really got the impression that even if Rachel could solve the mystery, she'd rid herself of the curse.  Also it should be known that none of the characters are particularly pleasant as Rachel, a single, working mother, at least initially, seemed more focused on her career than her son, and Noah, whose role I purposely left ambiguous, came off as a complete a-hole (check out the scene with Noah and Aidan in the car and you'll see what I mean).  Even the kid Aidan came off all creepy and such, especially when referring to his mother by her name rather than calling her `mom'.  Despite my being put off by these characters none really seemed deserving of the fate they were destined for, so I did find myself interested in their relative well being (Rachel's attitudes change slightly as the story moves along, but I'm still unsure if it was due to a mother's love or her own sense of self preservation), except for maybe Noah.  While I may not have liked the characters all that much, I thought the performances were well done, and the direction taut and engaging.  The pacing was solid and even, as the story never really got tiresome or boring.  I did like the twists at the end, one of which involved Noah and provided for one of the more memorable and disturbing visuals in the film.  All in all I thought this a very well made, nightmarish affair, one worth watching at least twice of only to pick up on that which may have been missed the first time around.  As far as those who've seen the film, was I the only one who found that fingernail bit within the cursed video extremely uncomfortable to watch?  That's a pain that will linger...The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), comes across very well, and the audio, available in DTS 5.1 Surround (English), Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (English and French), and Dolby Surround 2.0 (English), is strong and clear.  Extras, which aren't much, include subtitles in English, Spanish, and French, a short film by Gore Verbinski, one that apparently utilizes footage shot but not used in the final release of the film, and trailers for Ringu (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and 8 Mile (2002).  Also included, as a slightly hidden feature, is a complete showing of the material present on the `cursed' tape, which last roughly two minutes, if you dare...Cookieman108By the way, in case you're

606394,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005JLTK,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[2, 6]","Gore Verbinski's Hollywood remake of Hideo Nakata's creepfest is more faithful than it is usually given credit for. Sure, the original offers better atmosphere but I think that a good portion of that may be due to the level of discomfort the average viewer feels while watching any foreign film. This is simply not possible to achieve in a movie cast with familiar faces speaking in (mostly) unaccented English.But for those who are unable or unwilling to watch Ringu, the original, The Ring is a workable substitute. The radiant Naomi Watts stars in her first film after her breakthrough role in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. If that hadn't already made her a star, the box office success of this film would have. It showcases her best abilities in a more accessible form.The Ring opens with Joan of Arcadia's Amber Tamblyn at a sleepover with a friend. As the friend tells her the rumor of a video that kills the viewer seven days after watching it, recognition dawns on Tamblyn's face: she's seen it, she says, seven nights ago, with her boyfriend. This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, as well as giving Watts something to investigate (Tamblyn plays her niece).But once it becomes personal (when Watts and other members of her family see the film themselves), the strangeness that carries throughout The Ring really takes over. It's a mystery to be solved wrapped in the guise of a horror film with a taste of the surreal (shades of Un Chien Andalou); a perfect choice for a cold, rainy night's viewing.(Also included on the DVD is a featurette incorporating deleted scenes into their corresponding theatrical sequences. This reimagining illuminates the story surrounding the video a bit more and retains the creepy mood set by the feature. The ending is particularly chilling, however The Ring itself will become less timely as DVDs continue to take over the marketplace originally held by VHS. There will come a day -- too soon, unfortunately -- when people will be watching it thinking, ""Oh, look, a video; how quaint"" and the film will have lost all its power to terrorize.)",5,Don't compare it to the original and you'll be just fine,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,2100,"['Gore', 'Verbinski', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'creepfest', 'more', 'faithful', 'usually', 'given', 'credit', 'Sure', 'original', 'offers', 'better', 'atmosphere', 'think', 'good', 'portion', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'level', 'discomfort', 'average', 'viewer', 'feels', 'watching', 'foreign', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', 'achieve', 'movie', 'cast', 'familiar', 'speaking', 'mostly', 'unaccented', 'English.But', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'watch', 'Ringu', 'original', 'Ring', 'workable', 'substitute', 'radiant', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'stars', 'first', 'film', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'made', 'star', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'best', 'abilities', 'more', 'accessible', 'form.The', 'Ring', 'opens', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'sleepover', 'friend', 'friend', 'rumor', 'video', 'viewer', 'seven', 'days', 'watching', 'recognition', 'dawns', 'Tamblyn', 'face', 'seen', 'seven', 'nights', 'ago', 'boyfriend', 'sequence', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'Watts', 'something', 'investigate', 'Tamblyn', 'niece', 'personal', 'when', 'Watts', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'see', 'film', 'strangeness', 'Ring', 'really', 'over', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'wrapped', 'guise', 'horror', 'film', 'taste', 'surreal', 'shades', 'Un', 'Chien', 'Andalou', 'perfect', 'choice', 'cold', 'rainy', 'night', 'viewing', 'Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'incorporating', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'corresponding', 'theatrical', 'sequences', 'reimagining', 'story', 'surrounding', 'video', 'bit', 'more', 'creepy', 'mood', 'set', 'feature', 'ending', 'particularly', 'chilling', 'however', 'Ring', 'will', 'become', 'less', 'timely', 'DVDs', 'continue', 'take', 'over', 'marketplace', 'originally', 'held', 'VHS', 'will', 'come', 'day', 'too', 'soon', 'unfortunately', 'when', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'look', 'video', 'how', 'quaint', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'lost', 'power', 'terrorize']",N/A

We see this happen in the opening part of the film. One of the victims is the niece of Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts) who because of the request of her sister digs deeper into the mystery of four young teens who die in mysterious ways all exactly at the same time. The same four friends who watched the video together exactly one week earlier. Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well. She soon realises she must solve the origins of the tape quickly as she herself recieved the same phone call straight after viewing the cursed tape.

606401,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JLTK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","As much as I love the horror genre, I will admit that only rarely has such a film aspired to let alone attained the artistic plateau upon which The Ring proudly sits.  The movie is an artistic masterpiece, a film whose amazing textures and tones invite multiple viewings and a never-ending search for further insight into its darkly beautiful truth.  I find myself examining everything my eyes run across, trying to analyze the pattern of raindrops on a car windshield, watching in curious awe the rushed setting of the sun behind a magnificent tree, wondering if door number 601 means something, etc.  While the original state of advanced creepiness and awe-struck surprise fades to some degree after the first viewing, The Ring somehow manages to completely captivate me every time I watch it.  The plot is, naturally, a little on the weird side, but it certainly seems straightforward enough for me to wonder why some viewers claim they did not understand the movie.  I don't think anyone can truly pick out and digest all of the subtle implications of the film on the first viewing, but there's really nothing incomprehensible about The Ring at all.I won't even try to describe the plot; any iota of preconceived notions or revealed plot points robs the potential viewer of the complete experience this movie takes pride in delivering.  One issue of concern with a lot of horror movies is of course the ending, and the anticipation one feels sitting down to watch The Ring for the first time can very well preprogram the brain to expect a let-down of some type.  I can assure you that the final plot twists and ultimate ending will delight you and renew your faith in truly original movies of this genre.  I should add the fact that the ending does much to counterbalance the riveting early moments of the film.  In my opinion, the opening scene here is the creepiest, most powerful beginning to a horror movie I have ever seen, and I assure you that this is a very bold statement on my part.  The cast, I must say, is wonderful.  Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson help sell the mysterious truth about ""the tape"" to any viewers reluctant to suspend their disbelief, but it is the children who make this movie a truly creepy good time.  David Dorfman makes young Aidan a dark and complex little boy who, one might think just by watching him, could very well be Antichrist material.  The mysterious child Samara is the pivotal character in this film, the conduit for all of the horror and psychological manifestations of dread and fear, and Daveigh Chase is uncannily remarkable in the role.While the movie is a horror masterpiece that sells itself, I am a little disappointed at the paucity of extras included with the DVD.  With so many artistic nuances complementing a wildly unpredictable plot, I would dearly love to have the director or an actor or two offer their thoughts on the process in the form of a commentary.  The ""never-before-seen short film"" of roughly 15 minutes is good, but I can't say that it really delivered many new revelations about The Ring.  There was one additional piece of information I picked up that works on a psychological level, but overall it is certainly not a Rosetta Stone with which to translate the secrets of the film.  Consisting of several deleted scenes mixed within a cauldron of images from the film itself, it was little more than interesting to me.

606414,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JLTK,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[40, 57]","For those who like their horror with spurting blood and ear-piercing screams, &quot;The Ring&quot; will disappoint since its disturbing eeriness stems more from  psychological tension and creepy images.  That's not to say it doesn't have its gory moments, though.  Naomi Watts plays Rachel, a reporter, who sets out to decipher why her teenage niece died unexpectedly.  When she hears rumors of a deadly videotape, she tracks it down and watches it alone in a cabin.  The tape itself is not frightening - not at first; it's a surreal collage of striking, bizarre images.  But immediately after seeing it, Rachel receives a phone call that sets everything in motion.The pacing is superb as no scene, no moment is wasted.  Director Verbinski makes sure that the viewer must pay attention to every word, and this intense demand on the viewer increases the tension.  The videotape itself evolves as the film does, making its initial strangeness transform into real horror.  As Rachel discovers the meaning of each image, the suspense mounts, especially when her friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her small son Aidan (David Dorfman) become involved. Watts does an admirable job keeping her character grounded and real, and that goes a long way in upping the stakes for the viewer.  Little David Dorfman plays her adorable but creepy son Aidan with just the right amount of wide-eyed expression and deadpan delivery.  Just wait until the next time you slip a VHS tape into a player, or flick on the television.  You will immediately be taken back to this film with a small jolt.This chilling film relies heavily on atmosphere and anticipation to evoke its horror.

I jump at the the occasional spring-loaded cat (like the one in MINORITY REPORT), but efforts to make me quiver in my seat and sleep with the lights on never seem to work for me. Along comes THE RING, Hollywood's insidious effort to get me to label my videotapes.The movie's very well made. The effort is there to make a really creepy film, and the material the film is built on is suitably freaky. It's a bit unfortunate that the vastly inferior FEARDOTCOM pilfered so blatantly from the original story--the twisted plot would have been a lot more impressive if the key parts of it hadn't been paraded past us just a few months ago.As for THE RING, the visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is excellent, but when you try to add it all up, you end up with more questions than answers, and pretty pedestrian questions, at that. Put as many twists, turns and shocks into a movie as you like--you still have to pay off what you set up.Maybe this is a &quot;more to the story than meets the eye&quot; situation, or maybe it's a story where questions and hints are meant to be taken as absolute fact. Either way, the information you need in order to understand what's going on is practically invisible, here. It's not hard to tell what happens, but the average viewer comes away with way too many questions about WHY it happens.I do appreciate the clever approach to presenting deleted scenes in this one: make it a separate film that feels like story moments we didn't see in the original, tied together with a similar feel and enough of the main story for us to understand where the scenes would have appeared if they hadn't been cut from the film. The deleted scenes feel as creepy and suspensful as the original, as well as offering a few nice pointed observations from the townsfolk to fill in a bit of the Morgans' story.Is it scary? I'm the wrong person to ask. Is it entertaining? Yeah, I think so. Much better than the average Hollow-wood &quot;churn 'em out&quot; horror film. Does it make sense? Depends who you ask.

It doesn't have a cache of other-worldly monsters, ghouls, or zombies.  And it's one of the best horror movies this old geezer has seen in a long, long time.  I had heard from other horror buffs that THE RING is a true spooker; but it wasn't until recently I was able to catch the entire film on cable.And I never stirred from my couch as I watched.THE RING works so well because it's effects are entirely cerebral--on the characters as well as the viewers.  A VHS tape with very disturbing images apparently condemns its viewers to a horrid death exactly 7 days after the viewing--a tape paranormally made by an incredibly disturbed girl.  Now that's a premise you can sink your fangs into!  When young journalist Rachel (Naomi Watts is solid) begins investigating the disturbing events surrounding her niece's death, she views the tape herself (and her young psychic son, Aidan, also watches the tape); the plot then becomes a race to solve the events leading up to the making of the video, along with somehow reversing the curse.  So many of the images are disturbing, as we witness (and identify with) Rachel's growing desperation.  Many other horror films are paced and structured accordingly--only to dissolve stupidly in the end; here, while some of the elements are just plain silly (especially when we learn why some viewers are spared), THE RING delivers an ending worthy of all the plot building.

Mok,"[6, 23]","Once I got past the idea that I was expected to be terrified in watching The Ring, I began to enjoy myself a whole lot more.I think it was a mistake to try to market this film as horror.  The awareness that it takes seven days for you to die after watching the tape only means there isn't ever much physical danger -- you know the character would make it until the last day arrives.  The PG-13 rating, ensuring that the mayhem and shock imagery would be somewhat tamed, didn't help.  And there's the somewhat goofy premise.  That such a fuss was made of a VHS tape (right down to references its timecode) is a real stretch.But once I figured out that The Ring isn't really a horror film, I was able to accept it much more on its own terms.  Naomi Watts deserves all the accolades she got for holding this film together.  The woman has never given a bad or even mediocre performance in her career, and her turn in The Ring reminds me of her last foray into horror -- Children of the Corn IV.  Believe it or not, that was a fantastic acting turn, and Watts gives The Ring the same grace, sympathy and emotional commitment that has made her great.  She has a special knack for layering every emotional moment with precisely its opposite spectrum -- moments of anger turn into sorrow; fear is tinged with joy and strength; and given the somewhat weak supporting cast, Watts is the only reason you care about any of the other characters at all.Though I nearly laughed out loud at the ludicrous first scene of the film, again, once I figured out that this isn't truly a horror film, Ehren Kruger's script began to look like a pretty good job.  The lines are crisper and better thought out than in modern horror brethren like FearDotCom, and the visual and story setups and payoffs are quite satisfying.I haven't seen the Japanese original so I can't draw any comparison.  However, I think The Ring is at worst a slightly spooky, beautifully shot time-passer, and at its best, it is a pretty good mythical drama which showcases a brilliant actress, who is finally getting the attention she deserves.",3,"Best viewed as a mystery, not a horror film.",1046822400,"03 5, 2003",2003,2092,"['Once', 'got', 'idea', 'was', 'expected', 'be', 'terrified', 'watching', 'Ring', 'began', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'lot', 'more.I', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'try', 'market', 'film', 'horror', 'awareness', 'seven', 'days', 'die', 'watching', 'tape', 'only', ""n't"", 'ever', 'much', 'physical', 'danger', 'know', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'last', 'day', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'ensuring', 'mayhem', 'shock', 'imagery', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'tamed', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'somewhat', 'goofy', 'premise', 'such', 'fuss', 'was', 'made', 'VHS', 'tape', 'right', 'down', 'references', 'timecode', 'real', 'stretch.But', 'once', 'figured', 'out', 'Ring', ""n't"", 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'accept', 'much', 'more', 'own', 'terms', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'accolades', 'got', 'holding', 'film', 'together', 'woman', 'never', 'given', 'bad', 'even', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'career', 'turn', 'Ring', 'last', 'foray', 'horror', 'Children', 'Corn', 'IV', 'Believe', 'not', 'was', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'turn', 'Watts', 'Ring', 'same', 'grace', 'sympathy', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'made', 'great', 'special', 'knack', 'layering', 'emotional', 'moment', 'precisely', 'opposite', 'spectrum', 'moments', 'anger', 'turn', 'sorrow', 'fear', 'tinged', 'joy', 'strength', 'given', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Watts', 'only', 'reason', 'care', 'other', 'characters', 'nearly', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'ludicrous', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'again', 'once', 'figured', 'out', ""n't"", 'truly', 'horror', 'film', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'script', 'began', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'lines', 'are', 'crisper', 'better', 'thought', 'out', 'modern', 'horror', 'brethren', 'FearDotCom', 'visual', 'story', 'setups', 'payoffs', 'are', 'quite', 'satisfying.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Japanese', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'draw', 'comparison', 'However', 'think', 'Ring', 'worst', 'slightly', 'spooky', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'time-passer', 'best', 'pretty', 'good', 'mythical', 'drama', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'who', 'finally', 'getting', 'attention']",N/A

So VERY wrong about this movie.  I have not been so creeped out by a movie since I saw Poltergeist when I was 8 years old. I believe it has more to do with the cinematography itself than the story, but I also like the fact that they don't rely on gore to scare you. Gory movies have never scared me anyways. In fact, you would hardly know that they were trying to scare you were it not for the creepy feeling you get while watching this movie that will not go away.

Not only is she dumb enough to watch a tape she has already been warned will kill her - she then plays it for her ex-boyfriend. That's being a little bit spiteful, isn't it? Then, and this is the kicker, she makes COPIES of the tape, and leaves the copies around for friends and loved ones to stumble upon. Characters like this deserve to advance straight to Death. No passing GO.  No collecting $200. They must die, and they must die painfully.And when people in The Ring watch the deadly videotape, they watch it with their noses four inches away from the TV monitor.  Have you ever tried this?  Your head explodes after about five minutes.  Who watches TV like this?  Suffice to say that if the videotape doesn't kill all the characters, radiation poisoning surely will.  Consider it a mercy killing.More cliches abound.  The Ring also features not, on, not two, but THREE Scary Kids. The Scary Kid cliche has dominated horror movies for the past five years, and director Gore Verbinski thinks that having multiple Scary Kids adds up to a masterpiece of terror. The end result ends up being quite the opposite.  There are some mild scares in The Ring, but it's essentially a scary movie for people who are scared by everything.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Every horror buff knows -- the horror that creeps up on you gradually is much, much scarier the one who bounces out and yells ""boo"" as it decapitates somebody with a machete.And sadly, most current ""horror"" movies lack horror, because it's easier to substitute it with screaming blondes, blood, guts and sharp objects. But ""The Ring"" is soaked in foreboding, creepiness and horrific imagery. Director Gore Verbinski relies heavily on the original Japanese movie for a lot of his remake's flavor, and the result is a slow-building terror that keeps twisting right up to the end.Single mum Rachel (Naomi Watts) is attending her niece's funeral, after she died under bizarre circumstances. Several of her friends died on the exact same day, at the same time, which (surprise surprise) makes Rachel think this isn't a coincidence. So she investigates the mountain cabin all the kids stayed at a week ago, and finds an unlabeled videotape with a series of bizarre images -- and a curse that will kill you one week afterwards.She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) to help her unravel and break the curse. The secret of the tape is wrapped up in a young girl, Samara, who vanished from her adoptive parents' horse farm years ago. Somehow Samara's evil rage has lived in on her curse, and it will destroy Rachel, Noah and their son unless Rachel can find a way to escape it.Remaking Asian horror movies is one of those movie trends that is hanging on in Hollywood, with everything from ""The Grudge"" to ""The Eye"" to ""Bangkok Dangerous"" getting the A-list Hollywood treatment. Some are good, some are mediocre, most are wretched. But ""The Ring"" was the first of these, adapted from Hideo Nakata's adaptation of Koji Suzuki's novel (cue cries of ""but the original was better). And it achieves the distinction of being almost as atmospheric and haunting as the original.Most of its brilliance comes from director Gore Verbinski, who thankfully did not simply use the name and concept, and invent a teenybopper plot around that. This is actually rather similar to Nakata's adaptation -- Verbinski alters some few things from the original film, but keeps the same dark, murky atmosphere and many of the same scenes. Even the cinematography has a dark, overcast look, filled with forbidding symbolism -- lots of grey skies and overflowing water. It's as if Samara's influence is permeating everything.And what about the horror? It comes from the building tension as Rachel's deadline creeps toward us, and brief flashes of Samara's influence -- for example, that poor horse going berserk on a ferry, or the blurred-out faces of the doomed. The entire movie is infused with the feeling that something invisible and ghastly is just waiting to attack you, and it's just waiting for the right moment.The keystone of this movie is Naomi Watts. This talented actress is virtually perfect as the perpetually worried, perplexed Rachel; as the deadline approaches, her fear and grief are almost palpably overwhelming. Henderson is also good, whether as a flip carefree artist or as a caring ex-boyfriend. Dorfman is the one disappointment -- he seems less like a little boy than a pompous oracle, and he's almost creepier than Samara.Which is saying something, because Daveigh Chase is utterly chilling as Samara Morgan, a creepy little devil-child with black weedy hair over her face, a white nightgown and ""Omen"" eyes. In keeping with the watery theme of the movie, she always seems vaguely damp.""The Ring"" is one of those rarest kinds of movies -- a remake with its own flavour, even as it sticks to the original story. Excellent direction, great acting, and the haunting determination to never, ever watch an unlabeled movie again.",4,... and then you die,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,3738,"['horror', 'buff', 'horror', 'up', 'gradually', 'much', 'much', 'scarier', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'yells', 'boo', 'somebody', 'machete.And', 'sadly', 'most', 'current', 'horror', 'movies', 'lack', 'horror', 'easier', 'substitute', 'screaming', 'blondes', 'blood', 'guts', 'sharp', 'objects', 'Ring', 'soaked', 'foreboding', 'creepiness', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'heavily', 'original', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'lot', 'remake', 'flavor', 'result', 'slow-building', 'terror', 'twisting', 'right', 'up', 'end.Single', 'mum', 'Rachel', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'attending', 'niece', 'funeral', 'died', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'Several', 'friends', 'died', 'exact', 'same', 'day', 'same', 'time', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Rachel', 'think', ""n't"", 'coincidence', 'mountain', 'cabin', 'kids', 'stayed', 'week', 'ago', 'unlabeled', 'videotape', 'series', 'bizarre', 'images', 'curse', 'will', 'kill', 'one', 'week', 'afterwards.She', 'help', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Noah', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'help', 'unravel', 'break', 'curse', 'secret', 'tape', 'wrapped', 'up', 'young', 'girl', 'Samara', 'who', 'vanished', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'horse', 'farm', 'years', 'ago', 'Somehow', 'Samara', 'evil', 'rage', 'lived', 'curse', 'will', 'destroy', 'Rachel', 'Noah', 'son', 'Rachel', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'it.Remaking', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'movie', 'trends', 'hanging', 'Hollywood', 'everything', 'Grudge', 'Eye', 'Bangkok', 'Dangerous', 'getting', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'mediocre', 'most', 'are', 'wretched', 'Ring', 'was', 'first', 'adapted', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'adaptation', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'novel', 'cue', 'cries', 'original', 'was', 'better', 'distinction', 'being', 'almost', 'atmospheric', 'haunting', 'original.Most', 'brilliance', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'thankfully', 'did', 'not', 'simply', 'use', 'name', 'concept', 'invent', 'teenybopper', 'plot', 'actually', 'rather', 'similar', 'Nakata', 'adaptation', 'Verbinski', 'few', 'things', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'dark', 'murky', 'atmosphere', 'many', 'same', 'scenes', 'Even', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'overcast', 'look', 'filled', 'forbidding', 'symbolism', 'lots', 'grey', 'skies', 'overflowing', 'water', 'Samara', 'influence', 'permeating', 'everything.And', 'what', 'horror', 'building', 'tension', 'Rachel', 'deadline', 'brief', 'flashes', 'Samara', 'influence', 'example', 'poor', 'horse', 'going', 'berserk', 'ferry', 'blurred-out', 'doomed', 'entire', 'movie', 'infused', 'feeling', 'something', 'invisible', 'ghastly', 'just', 'waiting', 'attack', 'just', 'waiting', 'right', 'moment.The', 'keystone', 'movie', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'talented', 'actress', 'virtually', 'perfect', 'perpetually', 'worried', 'perplexed', 'Rachel', 'deadline', 'approaches', 'fear', 'grief', 'are', 'almost', 'palpably', 'overwhelming', 'Henderson', 'also', 'good', 'flip', 'carefree', 'artist', 'caring', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Dorfman', 'one', 'disappointment', 'less', 'little', 'boy', 'pompous', 'oracle', 'almost', 'creepier', 'Samara.Which', 'saying', 'something', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'utterly', 'chilling', 'Samara', 'Morgan', 'creepy', 'little', 'devil-child', 'black', 'weedy', 'hair', 'face', 'white', 'nightgown', 'Omen', 'eyes', 'keeping', 'watery', 'theme', 'movie', 'always', 'vaguely', 'damp', 'Ring', 'one', 'rarest', 'kinds', 'movies', 'remake', 'own', 'flavour', 'even', 'original', 'story', 'Excellent', 'direction', 'great', 'acting', 'haunting', 'determination', 'never', 'ever', 'watch', 'unlabeled', 'movie', 'again']",N/A

Day ""ENIGMA""","[3, 3]","If you've read any of my past reviews you already know of my endless anger and disgust over Hollywood's recent pattern of remaking already done horror movies. And please don't mistake me, it's not so much i mind remakes but if you are going to take the time to do so, lets at least try and make it better than the original (i.e. KING KONG is an example where this succeeded, and yes i know King Kong isn't horror but you get the point).Long has it been accepted that for a horror movie to work, it simply MUST BE rated 'R'. Rare is the occasion where a PG or PG-13 will generate more than a small tremor from most; and to be honest the only PG rated horror movie that ever left a lasting effect on me (before viewing this one of course) was Poltergeist. Hell, now that i think of it, never since Poltergeist has there been a movie that made people want to turn their TV's off and do something else more constructive instead (especially when a snowy screen comes on).I don't know what it is about a demonic little girl that gives me (and many others id suppose) the Willie's, but we have got to get this girl (Samara) and Regan (the little girl from The Exorcist) in a room together.I must admit this movie floored me in that it had almost no blood, little violence, no decapitations, stabbings, or scary chase scenes and the traditional gore, that one often feels makes horror ...well........ horror. The movie gets you with disturbing imagery and the most frightful tool that can be utilized (that sadly few producers use these days)... your own imagination. It's free and works better than all the digital imagery and special effects anyone could ever muster.I wont go into too much, so as to not ruin it for you. The movie is about a video that when watched will lead to your eventual demise 7 days later. The most disturbing aspect of this is when one takes a second to think...'ya know something this video that allegedly has the effect of leaving it's viewer dead is the exact movie I'm watching on video right now...... I wonder if......?'Yea,yea, i know...it's pretty far fetched.. still it plays with ones imagination, makes you think, and holds your attention unlike most horror movies these days.

So here goes....-I was concidering buying this....  maybe if it goes on deep discount.-The film has a very spooky feal to it but not many scares.  I was most startled by cenetipede crawling out from under a paper.-The story has too many holes (no pun intended) to count.  Perhaps if they didn't try to explain any of it I would have accepted it.-This has ""Sequel"" written all over it.  ""Ringu"" has 2 sequels.-If you like the feal but not the story, try ""The Shining"".  Much more cohesive without explaining everything.-Camera work is outstanding.-Excellent use of music and sound(or quiet)to set the mood.-Some of the deleated scenes should be put back.  Why not?  The story is already disjointed.-A very quiet movie that forces you to turn up the volume...  ... then ZAPS you with something loud but perhaps not scary.-The video was the most spooky thing in the film.  If it just lead to something....-This is a ""scary mystery"" story.  The problem is the clues don't really solve anything.  It all turned out to be pointless.-""The Exorcist"" with aging special affects is still much scarier than this, and it actually has a beginning and an end.-5 better movies that will leave you fealing disturbed and uneasy:  Shining, Exorcist, ""living Dead"" trilogy, Silence of the lambs and the original ""Hellraiser"".

A vague face peering in the window at me from the blackness. Always the subtle, always the implied. The paranoia of the unseen and the unknown. The Ring is an exercize in implication, in the imagined, in the string of terrible coincidences that make something so astronomically improbable horribly true. Its very much like a nightmare, an altered sense of consciousness.Is is disjointed? Yes. Nightmares don't make complete sense, but they're still frightening. They progress on suggestion; when you think something horrible is going to happen, no matter how improbable, it happens. And, it isn't even as if The Ring's plot is illogical. One can see how things move from one point to the next; at worst, one might call the plotting convenient (eg. she just HAPPENS to open the right notebook in which there HAPPENS to be the claim-ticket for CERTAIN photographs that lead to the next clue/scene). I just went with the flow, and it didn't bother me.As for questions the movie doesn't answer ... I don't know what questions those might be. It made sense to me. The whys and wherefores weren't overtly stated, but I was able to surmise what had happened in the past, what was happening, and why. How can a video [end life]? Trying not to spoil anything, I must point out that videotape is only a medium. Medium: a conduit through which something passes. For instance, people who supposedly channel spirits are called mediums, right? This is, after all, a SUPERNATURAL horror story, and there are similar myths of curses taking the form of symbols, icons, and other writings and drawings; you read it or examine it too long, and you get the whammy. Me, I like stories about ghosts and psychic abilities and stuff. It's a matter of personal tastes.My only complaint is for the DVD. There's only the movie itself and a side entry with some tarted-up scenes that hadn't made the original cut. I'd recommend waiting for a special edition to be released before buying.

Besides that countdown being unnerving, what's also unnerving is that it doesn't seem like the aunt is accomplishing much each day.

The American remake is pretty good, but the silent eeriness that's constant in the original works more for me rather than the high-voltage ""jump"" effects. Plus, eighteen-year old Sadako is much scarier than ten-year old Samara. But performance-wise, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson are more believable. Plus, Brian Cox is in the film, so it brings my grade up a notch. Finally, there's the cursed videotape. The longer American version is all for disturbing images and shrieking sound effects, while the original is only forty seconds long and contains only one scary image. I do believe I like the tapes equally (though I definitely wouldn't want to die in seven days when I watch them).All in all, The American Ring works for its shock effects and its horrifying climax.

606448,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B00005JLTK,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[2, 2]","The creepy plot centres around a cursed videotape that brings death within seven days to whoever views it. The central character, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) stumbles upon the tape while investigating the mysterious death of her niece and ends up watching it. Rachel must now hurry up and solve the mystery within the time period or she too will succumb to the videotapes murderous wrath.A remake of the Japanese hit ""Ringu"", this is probably the best horror movie of the last 10 years. It's no where near as entertaining or as frightening as some of the earlier classics but when compared to the numerous horror movie atrocities released from Hollywood recently, fans of the genre should be thankful ""The Ring"" exists. It has good performances from the ensemble cast (although the child star David Dorfman is rather charmless), a sinister storyline (although a bit confusing) and some effective visuals. I really like the fact that the film does not try to explain every little detail and leaves a lot to the viewers imagination. For instance, the origins of the evil is not fully explained so the viewer is left with several unanswered questions at the film's conclusion. Also interesting is the film's overall look. There is a lot of grey skies and rain on display. The entire mood is dark, grey and depressingly gloomy adding to the overall tension and fear. The actors themselves have a constant blank stare on their scared faces adding to the tone.Let's not forget one of the key figures in ""The Ring"", the heinous, murderous Samara. A one-of-a-kind, under-sized villain with a heart of stone and a mind full of vengeance. In ""Ringu"" the villain's face is never shown (only her eyes) and she does not speak. She remains a mysterious, silent, face-less character throughout the film. Not so in ""The Ring"". We not only get to clearly see the child monster but we get to hear her as well. There is a face to the plot's evil and despite this, it does not seem to diminish Samara's eerie hold over the audience.My biggest complaint with this film is that it's far too long. The whole mystery could have been solved a good 25 minutes sooner so the film does drag a bit. But considering ""The Ring"" is the best fright film Hollywood has given us in a very, very long time, it's a small price to pay.This disturbing little chiller is highly recommended. You might want to double your pleasure and follow it up with it's much inferior but still watchable sequel ""The Ring Two"".",4,She Never Sleeps.,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2473,"['creepy', 'plot', 'cursed', 'videotape', 'death', 'seven', 'days', 'whoever', 'views', 'central', 'character', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'tape', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'death', 'niece', 'up', 'watching', 'Rachel', 'must', 'now', 'hurry', 'up', 'solve', 'mystery', 'time', 'period', 'too', 'will', 'succumb', 'videotapes', 'murderous', 'wrath.A', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'hit', 'Ringu', 'probably', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'last', '10', 'years', 'where', 'near', 'entertaining', 'as', 'frightening', 'earlier', 'classics', 'when', 'compared', 'numerous', 'horror', 'movie', 'atrocities', 'released', 'Hollywood', 'recently', 'fans', 'genre', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'Ring', 'good', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'child', 'star', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'rather', 'charmless', 'sinister', 'storyline', 'bit', 'confusing', 'effective', 'visuals', 'really', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'try', 'explain', 'little', 'detail', 'lot', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'instance', 'origins', 'evil', 'not', 'fully', 'explained', 'so', 'viewer', 'left', 'several', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Also', 'interesting', 'film', 'overall', 'look', 'lot', 'grey', 'skies', 'rain', 'display', 'entire', 'mood', 'dark', 'grey', 'depressingly', 'gloomy', 'adding', 'overall', 'tension', 'fear', 'actors', 'have', 'constant', 'blank', 'stare', 'scared', 'adding', 'tone.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'one', 'key', 'figures', 'Ring', 'heinous', 'murderous', 'Samara', 'one-of-a-kind', 'under-sized', 'villain', 'heart', 'stone', 'mind', 'full', 'vengeance', 'Ringu', 'villain', 'face', 'never', 'shown', 'only', 'eyes', 'not', 'speak', 'mysterious', 'silent', 'face-less', 'character', 'film', 'Not', 'so', 'Ring', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'clearly', 'see', 'child', 'monster', 'get', 'hear', 'as', 'well', 'face', 'plot', 'evil', 'not', 'seem', 'diminish', 'Samara', 'eerie', 'hold', 'audience.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'whole', 'mystery', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'solved', 'good', '25', 'minutes', 'sooner', 'so', 'film', 'drag', 'bit', 'considering', 'Ring', 'best', 'fright', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'given', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'small', 'price', 'pay.This', 'disturbing', 'little', 'chiller', 'highly', 'recommended', 'might', 'want', 'double', 'pleasure', 'follow', 'up', 'much', 'inferior', 'still', 'watchable', 'sequel', 'Ring', 'Two']",N/A
606449,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B00005JLTK,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[2, 3]","I had heard of the ring from everyone around me when it had first come out, but not much after that. I heard about it later on when it came out on DVD, and since it was PG-13, I figured I could get it (I was only 13, and parents have limits on what they let their kids watch). I must admit, it didn't really scare me that much with the purpose it was supposed to. It did have jumps and twists that were indeed frightening, but what I really like the film is the originality of it, and the perfectness. I'll explain later.Rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is pretty much set into two words. Young and independent. Her son Aidan will show to that. But when her 16 year old neice dies, her thoughts begin to change about several things, especially life. Normally you'd shake off a teens death with the possibility of drugs, but what about three other kids Katie knew that all died at the exact same time as her?Rumors arouse about a video tape the four teenagers may have watched. Rachel, an investigative reporter, tracks down the tape, and inspects it, only to find that by doing so, she's just unravelled her own sealed fate. Now, the race against time is on to figure out who has created this mysterious and evil video tape, and why it is murdering people before Rachel herself falls victim to the ring.Gore Verbinski, who was the director, did an awesome job with the directing. The all too famous quote on the front cover tells it all. The acting in the movie is so good, it's scary. Naomi Watts as the young Rachel with her child did a good job at portraying a woman who has obviously gone through a lot in the past. David Dorfman as the independent Aidan did amazing also. I don't know how old that kid is, but however old he is, he's a really good child actor.There's a strange way that the ring captures audiences, which is why it was such a box office hit. There's just something that can't be explained, sort of like The Blair Witch Project was. Maybe it was it's jumps and it's twists and turns that have you going against everyone, yet in the end, you only have one villian, and that is one bad seed. Samara's origin is never explained, but that doesn't really matter to audiences who keep coming back for more.The affects and suspense in the movie do indeed add up to a lot of satisfying events, even some funny moments, but as tedious as the title may seem, it is relevant to the story. Some of the things in here (say the affects) are so perfect, that it makes you wonder how dreamworks pulled it off. It's a pretty thought provoking movie which will leave you wondering what happened, but sometimes, things don't need to make sense for a movie to be a good one. Seriously, I can't wait for the Ring Two to come out in March. Until then, looks like Samara will still never sleep.",5,"So good, it's scary",1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2800,"['had', 'heard', 'ring', 'everyone', 'when', 'had', 'first', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'much', 'heard', 'later', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'PG-13', 'figured', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'only', '13', 'parents', 'have', 'limits', 'what', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'scare', 'much', 'purpose', 'was', 'supposed', 'did', 'have', 'jumps', 'twists', 'were', 'indeed', 'frightening', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'originality', 'perfectness', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'later.Rachel', 'Keller', 'gorgeous', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'pretty', 'much', 'set', 'two', 'words', 'Young', 'independent', 'son', 'Aidan', 'will', 'show', 'when', '16', 'year', 'old', 'neice', 'dies', 'thoughts', 'begin', 'change', 'several', 'things', 'especially', 'life', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'shake', 'off', 'teens', 'death', 'possibility', 'drugs', 'what', 'three', 'other', 'kids', 'Katie', 'knew', 'died', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'Rumors', 'arouse', 'video', 'tape', 'four', 'teenagers', 'may', 'have', 'watched', 'Rachel', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'down', 'tape', 'only', 'find', 'doing', 'so', 'just', 'unravelled', 'own', 'sealed', 'fate', 'Now', 'race', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'created', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'video', 'tape', 'why', 'murdering', 'people', 'Rachel', 'victim', 'ring.Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'was', 'director', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'directing', 'too', 'famous', 'quote', 'front', 'cover', 'acting', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'scary', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'young', 'Rachel', 'child', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'woman', 'who', 'obviously', 'gone', 'lot', 'past', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'independent', 'Aidan', 'did', 'amazing', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'old', 'kid', 'however', 'old', 'really', 'good', 'child', 'strange', 'way', 'ring', 'captures', 'audiences', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'just', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'sort', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'Maybe', 'was', 'jumps', 'twists', 'turns', 'have', 'going', 'everyone', 'yet', 'end', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'villian', 'one', 'bad', 'seed', 'Samara', 'origin', 'never', 'explained', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'audiences', 'who', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more.The', 'affects', 'suspense', 'movie', 'do', 'indeed', 'add', 'up', 'lot', 'satisfying', 'events', 'even', 'funny', 'moments', 'as', 'tedious', 'title', 'may', 'seem', 'relevant', 'story', 'things', 'here', 'say', 'affects', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'wonder', 'how', 'dreamworks', 'pulled', 'off', 'pretty', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'sometimes', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'Seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Ring', 'Two', 'come', 'out', 'March', 'then', 'Samara', 'will', 'still', 'never', 'sleep']",N/A

606451,A3L8PEHENBZXI2,B00005JLTK,Eye In Sky,"[2, 4]","Once in a great while, quality horror movies come around that re-invent the wheel and discover new methods to terrify us in ways previously unimaginable.  Where most other films steal ideas or disappoint with bad acting or a lame story (or both), the genuine ones tend to use a unique concept that is miraculously capable of suspending our disbelief even long after this film's end.  These movies typically have very memorable scenes that engrave unforgettable images people will talk about time and time again.  Soon after, what was once a small little horror film becomes a timeless classic.  THE RING (which is a remake of the Japanese film RINGU) is definitely one of these movies.** SPOILER ALERT **The plot is relatively simple, but is executed very well.  A mysterious video is circulating around.  Once the video is seen by someone, that person receives a phone call letting them know they have 7 days left to live.  On the 7th day, those who have watched the video apparently die a horrible death (even their facial expressions just before they die are ""locked"" that reveals how horrified the victims were just before it happened).An investigator (Naomi Watts) takes personal interest in researching this phenomenon while finding clues to the puzzle along the way.  She discovers the video and decides to watch it for herself (we also get to view the entire video).  The video is very unsettling and does an excellent job in spooking the audience.  The phone call inevitably happens and now the audience is rooting for the investigator to solve the puzzle before her time runs out.The movie holds our interest tightly as pieces of the puzzle are discovered while other new questions are risen.  There are also a lot of wonderful, yet subtle techniques used to further intensify the mood:1.  The foreshadowing of the fly peeling off the monitor.  After watching this movie several times now, I also noticed the fly's movement pattern exactly matched the fly found in the records' storage area.2.  The documentary footage of Samara's clinical studies further elevated the film's legitimacy.  That was a very nice touch as it also made the audience sympathize with Samara even more.3.  The blurred faces on the unfortunate viewers of the cursed video amptly suggested how the people themselves were now cursed.4.  The horse scene was quite a shocker, and a bit disturbing too!  Another one of those ""memorable images"" engraved in my mind now.5.  Even more disturbing were the flashbacks of Samara's death and the method in how she died.  I felt the intensity of many scenes of this movie alone was enough to push its rating to ""R"" level even though there was almost no blood or gore.  I feel THE RING pushes the envelope on PG-13 the same way I felt POLTERGEIST pushed the envelope on PG during its day.6.  How the video itself is linked to key locations that the reporter finds as she tries to finish her investigation in time.** END SPOILER ALERT **This movie was very well constructed and will easily please both the casual and the more critical detail-oriented moviegoer.  The movie's pacing builds to a nice crescendo and it doesn't fall victim to overused clich&eacute;s.  Just when you think it was about to, another surprise is in store!  I have seen both the Japanese and the American versions and they are nearly identical in quality.  The story is exactly the same, and the American version follows the original very closely.  There are a few minor differences but my impression was that the Japanese version was slightly more subtle, but I wouldn't rate either to be significantly better or worse.  For those who would ask which one to see, I would recommend watching both, but to see the American version first as it definitely has better production value (both are about equally scary).I would also like to comment on Charles' comments regarding the floating microphone.  That anomaly is NOT present in the DVD nor the theater where I first saw the movie.  It is funny you should mention this problem as several years ago the same thing happened to me during another movie I saw, so I can relate to how it ruined the experience.  Believe me when I say it was the theater's fault as the 35mm print is uncropped and all they had to do was adjust the film on the projector so that it was properly centered.",4,So terrifying it's hard to believe its rating was PG-13!,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,4323,"['Once', 'great', 'while', 'quality', 'horror', 'movies', 'come', 're-invent', 'wheel', 'discover', 'new', 'methods', 'terrify', 'ways', 'previously', 'unimaginable', 'Where', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'steal', 'ideas', 'disappoint', 'bad', 'acting', 'lame', 'story', 'genuine', 'ones', 'tend', 'use', 'unique', 'concept', 'miraculously', 'capable', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'even', 'long', 'film', 'end', 'movies', 'typically', 'have', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'engrave', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'people', 'will', 'talk', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Soon', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'small', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'timeless', 'classic', 'RING', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'film', 'RINGU', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', '**', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '**The', 'plot', 'relatively', 'simple', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'mysterious', 'video', 'circulating', 'around', 'video', 'seen', 'someone', 'person', 'phone', 'call', 'letting', 'know', 'have', '7', 'days', 'left', 'live', '7th', 'day', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'video', 'apparently', 'horrible', 'death', 'even', 'facial', 'expressions', 'just', 'die', 'are', 'locked', 'how', 'horrified', 'victims', 'were', 'just', 'happened', '.An', 'investigator', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'personal', 'interest', 'researching', 'phenomenon', 'finding', 'clues', 'puzzle', 'way', 'video', 'decides', 'watch', 'also', 'get', 'view', 'entire', 'video', 'video', 'very', 'unsettling', 'excellent', 'job', 'spooking', 'audience', 'phone', 'call', 'inevitably', 'now', 'audience', 'rooting', 'investigator', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'time', 'out.The', 'movie', 'interest', 'tightly', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'discovered', 'other', 'new', 'questions', 'are', 'risen', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'subtle', 'techniques', 'used', 'further', 'intensify', 'mood:1', 'foreshadowing', 'fly', 'peeling', 'off', 'monitor', 'watching', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'also', 'noticed', 'fly', 'movement', 'pattern', 'exactly', 'matched', 'fly', 'found', 'records', 'storage', 'area.2', 'documentary', 'footage', 'Samara', 'clinical', 'studies', 'further', 'elevated', 'film', 'legitimacy', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'made', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'Samara', 'even', 'blurred', 'unfortunate', 'viewers', 'cursed', 'video', 'amptly', 'suggested', 'how', 'people', 'were', 'now', 'cursed.4', 'horse', 'scene', 'was', 'quite', 'shocker', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'too', 'one', 'memorable', 'images', 'engraved', 'mind', 'now.5', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'Samara', 'death', 'method', 'how', 'died', 'felt', 'intensity', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'push', 'rating', 'R', 'level', 'even', 'was', 'almost', 'blood', 'gore', 'feel', 'RING', 'envelope', 'PG-13', 'same', 'way', 'felt', 'POLTERGEIST', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'PG', 'day.6', 'How', 'video', 'linked', 'key', 'locations', 'reporter', 'finish', 'investigation', 'time', '**', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '**This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'constructed', 'will', 'easily', 'please', 'casual', 'more', 'critical', 'detail-oriented', 'moviegoer', 'movie', 'pacing', 'nice', 'crescendo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'victim', 'overused', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'was', 'about', 'surprise', 'store', 'have', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'American', 'versions', 'are', 'nearly', 'identical', 'quality', 'story', 'exactly', 'same', 'American', 'version', 'original', 'very', 'closely', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'differences', 'impression', 'was', 'Japanese', 'version', 'was', 'slightly', 'more', 'subtle', 'would', ""n't"", 'rate', 'be', 'significantly', 'better', 'worse', 'who', 'would', 'ask', 'one', 'see', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'see', 'American', 'version', 'first', 'definitely', 'better', 'production', 'value', 'are', 'equally', 'scary', '.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'comment', 'Charles', 'comments', 'regarding', 'floating', 'microphone', 'anomaly', 'NOT', 'present', 'DVD', 'theater', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'funny', 'should', 'mention', 'problem', 'several', 'years', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'movie', 'saw', 'can', 'relate', 'how', 'ruined', 'experience', 'Believe', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'theater', 'fault', '35mm', 'print', 'uncropped', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'adjust', 'film', 'projector', 'was', 'properly', 'centered']",N/A

Really, I just love J-Horror's and Asia Extreme. I'm an addict! I don't want to compare The Ring to Ringu though. So, The Ring is the story of Rachel Keller who has to take care of her son, Aidan. Her niece Katie watches a creepy film and receives a phone call saying she has 7 days to live. After 7 days, surprise surprise, she dies! Rachel investigates Katie's death and ends up watching the tape and, like a moron, brings it home where her son watches it. I mean, it's not bad enough that you are going to die in 7 days, but you bring the tape home, to where your child is. Is it not like...some unwritten rule that children are naturally curious...so even if they stumbled upon said tape and you told them to never touch it, they will regardless? So Rachel lets yet another person watch it and then goes on a mission for the next 7 days to figure out how to solve the mystery of the tape and save herself and her son. Although I bitch, and I do it quite frequently, about movie remakes, The Ring is one of my favorites! I loved it and I won't lie, I was freaked out at certain parts. It has a lot of scare factors. And kids are always creepy in movies like 'The Ring'Gore Verbinski is an amazing director and his job on 'The Ring' was no exception. Most people will probably recognize him from his work on 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. I'm fairly confident he didn't direct The Ring 2 but he did a great job on The Ring. Building up suspense and having scares at all the right times! The acting in The Ring was also excellent!

606453,ALR1CN6DL50DA,B00005JLTK,Felixpath,"[1, 4]","""The Ring"" opens with a scene that looks exactly like the opening scene of every slasher movie. Two teenage girls are at home alone, watching TV; one of them brings up a rumor about a cursed videotape that kills you seven days after you watch it; the other girl goes pale and reveals that she saw a weird videotape a week ago; etc. The scene moves along a familiar arc -- creepy sounds, a couple false alarms, and finally a violent death. However, it does not end with a psychopath jumping out of a closet, but with a fleeting glimpse of a grainy image on the victim's TV screen. And right away the movie has our interest, because we're wondering, ""What did we just see, and why did it literally scare her to death?""We meet the dead girl's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a harried reporter/single mom who begins investigating this supposed killer videotape. Her search leads her to a campground in the mountains, where she does indeed find a mysterious unmarked cassette. She watches it; it is filled with strange images such as a shimmering ring of light, a ladder, a woman falling off a cliff, severed fingers, etc. Then the phone rings, and a whispered voice tells her she has seven days to live.With the clock ticking, Rachel races to uncover the mystery of the tape. Who made it, and how? Who is the strange woman who appears on the tape? In her hunt for answers, Rachel enlists the help of her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), a computer geek who spouts techo-jargon and ominously informs her, ""This tape has no data code. That's like a person born without fingerprints."" There's also her little son, Aidan (David Dorfman), who begins drawing some rather disturbing pictures. Rachel has frightening dreams. Images from the tape appear in the real world. The clues lead her to a windswept island where some unpleasant deeds were done in the past, and from there.....well, I shouldn't reveal much more of the plot.""The Ring"" is not very original. It has all the standard elements of a supernatural thriller. Spontaneous nosebleeds? Check. A gloomy psychiatric ward? Check. A pseudo-psychic little kid? Yup. Water leaking from nowhere? Half-glimpsed figures? Sudden, chilling revelations? Animals freaking out for no reason? Creaking floorboards? They're all there. Where ""The Ring"" succeeds is in its central mystery, its muted atmosphere, its unsettling soundtrack, and some genuinely scary moments that -- for once -- don't rely on a sudden shock. The most frightening scene comes at the end, when we learn exactly how an image on a TV screen can scare someone to death. The scene happens in broad, stark daylight, and instead of trying to startle the audience, it moves with a steady, relentless pace, getting more terrifying by the second, until......well, this is horror at its most potent, and it makes up for the film's shortcomings.Naomi Watts has real star power, as evidenced by the arc of her movie career. (from ""Children of the Corn 5"" to an Oscar nom!) Here, she brings sympathy and desperation to her somewhat sparse character, and also proves she can scream really well. Martin Henderson is likable, even though his character is left by the wayside. David Dorfman does a nice job as the kid, even though he's an obvious rip-off of Haley Joel Osment. Brian Cox has an effective cameo as a reclusive old man, and Daveigh Chase, that sweet-voiced little girl from ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Lilo &amp; Stitch,"" is uncredited in a crucial role that horror movie buffs will be talking about for years to come.""The Ring"" is based strongly on a popular Japanese horror film that, according to most sources, is even better. I will see it in due time. For now, I'll just give thanks to this American film for scaring my pants off.

The original film is a quiet, dark, creepy exercise in atmospheric horror, and it is quite effective.  The American version, while incorporating a scene or two from the excellent Japanese sequel, Ring 2, sticks fairly close to its source material, but is, as you might expect from a more expensive Hollywood remake, flashier, slicker, more special-effects-dependent.  Even so, its considerably better than it might have been.  The filmmakers approached the material with at least a modicum of respect, and director Gore Verbinski seems to have a flair for the genre.  Neverthless, the result is a bit predictably dumbed-down, with some of the ambiguity inherent in the original removed.  Most notably, the video in the original consists of a series of bizarre images that, for the most part, are never explained.  In the American version, every sequence of the video is eventually assigned an explicit meaning.  Still, overall the film is well done, although it just isn't as effective as I wanted it to be.

606463,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005JLTK,General Zombie,"[2, 4]","As with just about everything that is a big time as 'The Ring' is, opinion on it is strongly divided.  Personally, I think it's great, and found it to be very scary on initial viewing, though it has somewhat lost it's ability to scare under repeated viewing. (as films are certain to do)  However, this hasn't dimmed my appreciated for the film any, as I'm not really interested in being scared by a film.  Besides, that's a stupid way to review a film, a what people are frightened by in film seems to be the most difficult to predict thing there is, and reviewing something by those standards will irrevocably color the way the audience views a film, so that they may not be able to appreciate the other aspects of it.  'The Ring' is certainly a horror film, but it's mostly a moody, imagistic horror film, though it still does leap to life at the appropriate moments.  And, I think it's a great horror movie, and a great movie by any standard.  If you haven't actually seen it yet, don't go in expecting to be terrified.  Just go in looking to see an interesting, well-crafted movie.Although everyone already knows it, I'll give a basic plot summation.  Alright, Rachel's niece, Katie, is killed one night under mysterious circumstances, and Rachel proceeds to investigate into how this might have happened.  She discovers that a number of her friends died at about the same time, and that they viewed a tape just a week earlier, which is rumored to kill you seven days after you view it.  She finds and views the tape, becomes convinced that it is in fact the cause of death, and desperately searches for a solution, particularly after her son Aidan views the tape.  I'll admit it, this is one wacky plot.  I was interested when I saw the ads, and heard some positive reviews from sources I trust, but was still a little worried upon hearing a plot synopsis. I think this is why so many people don't like it- they just can't take the notion of a haunted videotape seriously, and this is a horror film that simply will not work if you can't take it seriously.  It's not just a matter of being scared, it's that some people won't be able to take this seriously even on a simply dramatic level, and the whole film will  just be really silly.  Whether or not you will be able to take it seriously is a question I can't really answer, though I can say that me and all my friends were all concerned about the odd premise, but we all ended up liking it anyway.  So, even if you have doubts about it there's still a chance you can get into it.The performances are strong, though there generally isn't a whole lot in the way of characterization.  Rachel isn't all that likable, though I do rather like Noah, her estranged boyfriend and the father of Aidan, so there's a certain amount of personal involvement in the film.  Still, the strength of the film is in it's mood and images.  The tape itself is quite cool.  The old random montage of images is something of a clich&eacute; but they make it work anyway.  There are a number of truly striking images, particularly a large, solitary and vaguely surreal tree, which repeatedly shown at sunset, and a quaint yet extremely creepy and sparse little bedroom in the top of a barn, which can only be accessed by a frightfully tall and old looking ladder .  The film is set in the Pacific northwest, so it is perpetually raining, but it's a dreadful, depressing sort of rain rather than the `scary thunderstorm at night, kinda stuff.  The whole film was blueified, but for once this technique actually works, and it isn't so overdone that the characters look alien.  (See the plotless wonder `Crazy/Beautiful' for a film that has been over-blued for no apparent reason)There are some powerful set-pieces as well.  The opening scene, depicting Katie's death, is a standard `victim wandering about the empty house' scene, but it works better than most, and is really quite intense.  There is also a powerful, frightening suicide scene and an inexplicable scene involving a horse going wild and killing itself.  And the final horror scene is quite effective, though I won't go into specifics.Most of all, however, it's just a clever film, displaying connections and multiple meanings, some of which require multiple viewings to uncover.  It displays a nightmare logic, where numerous things connect to each, but we're often uncertain of how or why they do so.  Things they see in the tape are reflected in the real world, sometimes perhaps just a coincidence, other times suggesting an inevitability and lack of control on the part of the protagonists. This is scary, I think, but it's mostly just cool. I would try and go into specifics, but I'm having a tough time describing it, and I suppose it would be better to just see these things yourself.Well, I've been writing and writing and not done an at all good job of explaining myself, so I'll just screw it, and suffice to say that Kcin highly recommends this movie.

It is also one of those great ones that you and a friend can talk about afterwards, trying to interpret the ending.I am mystified by the people comparing it to the original Japanese version and complaining.  I rented ""Ringu"" last night from my neighborhood Blockbuster, and for the first hour the two films were virtually identical, shot for shot.  Granted the climax is much creepier in the original, however I thought it was ridiculous how the entire plot exposition was achieved because the boyfriend was psychic, so magically knew all the answers to her questions.  This was a cheap shortcut that cuts about a half-hour out compared to the American version (but given she only had a week to solve the mystery, this must have come in handy.  Leads one to wonder what she spent the other 23 hours of the day doing?) I found the American version far more believable based on this fact alone.  Not to mention only half the imagery in the video is explained in ""Ringu"", whereas the American version ties everything together neatly and logically by the end.Regardless of comparisons, the DVD is pretty good except for the lack of commentary.

606482,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,B00005JLTK,Henry Platte,"[0, 3]","It's difficult to explain why The Ring is so scary. Yes, as people have pointed out, parts of the plot are a bit implausible, and if you were in this situation in real life somehow, there are any number of things you could do to save yourself. It also bows to a couple of traditional horror-movie contrivances, and that little Sixth Sense-ripoff kid is so annoying you want to reach into the screen and strangle him. But what makes it so good, I think, is that it succeeds in spite of all that. It's like the old monster-under-the-bed fear; even though you know, rationally, that there is no monster under the bed, you still don't want to put your feet on the floor.  Even knowing the secret behind the plot (I had read the book before I saw the movie) doesn't make it any easier to bear. It's not scary because it makes you consider that you yourself could be killed by an angry ghost. That's not why horror movies work. It's scary because it was so well-made, and because the idea behind it is so powerful. It creates a situation which isn't just dependant on moments of specific horror, like ghosts suddenly popping out of the walls, to shock the viewer, but on a _situation_ which is so horrible that it leaves an indelible impression on you, and on images which are truly grotesque. It says a lot about the movie that (minor potential spoiler) that scene in which the ghost herself finally appears is one of the least scary in the movie. In the end, I thought the somehow stripped-down plot of the movie was much, much more frightening than the book, even if it lacked some of the book's philosophical substance.",5,"She Never Sleeps, and neither will you",1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,1617,"['difficult', 'explain', 'why', 'Ring', 'so', 'scary', 'Yes', 'people', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'parts', 'plot', 'are', 'bit', 'implausible', 'were', 'situation', 'real', 'life', 'somehow', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'save', 'also', 'couple', 'traditional', 'horror-movie', 'contrivances', 'little', 'Sixth', 'Sense-ripoff', 'kid', 'so', 'annoying', 'want', 'reach', 'screen', 'strangle', 'what', 'so', 'good', 'think', 'spite', 'old', 'monster-under-the-bed', 'fear', 'even', 'know', 'rationally', 'monster', 'bed', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'feet', 'floor', 'Even', 'knowing', 'secret', 'plot', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', 'bear', 'not', 'scary', 'consider', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'angry', 'ghost', 'not', 'why', 'horror', 'movies', 'work', 'scary', 'was', 'so', 'well-made', 'idea', 'so', 'powerful', 'situation', ""n't"", 'just', 'dependant', 'moments', 'specific', 'horror', 'ghosts', 'suddenly', 'popping', 'walls', 'shock', 'viewer', '_situation_', 'so', 'horrible', 'indelible', 'impression', 'images', 'are', 'truly', 'grotesque', 'lot', 'movie', 'minor', 'potential', 'spoiler', 'scene', 'ghost', 'finally', 'one', 'least', 'scary', 'movie', 'end', 'thought', 'somehow', 'stripped-down', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'book', 'even', 'lacked', 'book', 'philosophical', 'substance']",N/A

It was completely non-linear, which is what good movie making should be all about. The background story involves the little girl, Samara, who came about possibly by unnatural means. She has the ability to thought-project dark hallucinatory images, causing madness of an infectious scale. For a while, the girl is left in the care of an institution, where she is carefully studied, and her thought projections captured in negative print. Scattered images of Samara being monitored, even then a ghostly little girl with long dark hair hanging over eyes that look like swelled black pupils without irises. But eventually Samara is murdered, dropped into a well, and her abilities become demonic. Her residual imprint is captured in technology, her thoughts projected onto a simple video tape that provides her with a gateway into this world. If you watch the tape, taking in the nightmare images, forming the link, you die in seven days.One thing that seems almost unsettling is the fact that Samara was, in life, a beautiful kid, despite the things that lurked behind her pale doll's face. She renters this world as a vengeful wraith, with real, physical power, and with her other abilities amplied. By opening the gateway, via the video tape, Samara is able to seek out her victims and just turn them into ruin. When they find the victims later, they're shriveled, drained, ash-grey, with eyes filmed like milk, and horrified expressions that twist their faces into hideous masks. It's cool. The best part is that you never see the actual deaths, just the aftermath. It's a shadowy playground for the imagination, unlike with Fear Dot Com, which was an okay movie but made the mistake by showing you everything.I've heard this movie get maligned a little, but don't listen to any of it. This movie rules. The DVD itself has a short film that contains existing movie footage interspersed with deleted scenes, proving a little bit more in the way of background. (Actually I think it would have been even better if they had left those deleted scenes in.) There's also a trailer for the Japanese movie, Ringu, which The Ring was based upon. Haven't gotten a chance to see that one yet, but I want to, and I want to read the novel when it's released.

The movie centers around a video tape that if you watch, you will receive a phone call stating that you will die in seven days and in seven days, you see the ring and you die...creepy, huh?Well, the movie starts out very well and I can certainly see where people thought this movie was very scary...there are elements of horror to this film, but ""The Ring"" is really more of a mystery/suspense thriller than a ""pure horror"" film.  Certainly, Samara and the whole idea of this very creepy VHS tape provide the audience with moments of pure terror.Ultimately, ""The Ring"" is very much a psychological suspense thriller and you really have to pay very close attention to keep up with what is going on throughout the movie.  Also, the tape itself is very important as every single item or scene that you see in the tape has a specific meaning and is part of the puzzle that Rachael must put together in order to save herself and her son.However, the majority of the movie is not about horror or death, but it is about Racheal and Noah investigating this tape and trying to figure out the mystery behind this curse.  I think this investigation creates a building suspense in the audience as the movie moves towards its fantastic conclusion, but the essence of the film takes on a characterization of mystery/suspense rather than horror.The ending of this movie is quite scary, but the ending could have been even better.  All in all, this is a good film based on its merits of horror and certainly deserves a place in the horror genre, but it is just simply not a great horror movie and would be a better film under the mystery/suspense genre instead.If I was writing this review and grading it on the elements of suspense and mystery it creates, I would give it at least 4 stars, but I am a horror film addict and critic and based on horror film criteria, I can only attach a 3.65 star rating to it, which is really being quite generous.  One final note:  ""The Ring"" was based on a Japanese film called ""Ringu"" which I have not seen yet, but plan on doing so soon.  Hmmmm, on second thought, I don't understand Japanese though...oh well, maybe, I will write a review about that movie as well.

The role of Rachel was originally offered to Jennifer Connelly; and to be honest I would have loved to have seen what Jennifer would have done in a dark movie like this, considering she is my second favorite actress. Naomi is my favorite, but sometimes certain actors and actresses seem like they could fit better in certain roles than others; and Jennifer does well in films where she's being haunted in some way. But I digress...Naomi does a good job here, and that's all that matters in the end.The Ring was a commercial and critical success and put Naomi Watts's career on the steady rise.It's just too bad we have to copy Japanese horror flicks in order to have decent scary movies in American theaters.",4,A well done film.,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,1221,"['ironic', 'thing', 'Ring', 'obviously', 'horror', 'flick', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'thrilling', 'scary', 'Only', 'couple', 'places', 'One', 'place', 'being', 'beginning', '2', 'girls', 'towards', 'end', 'when', 'Samarra', 'tv.The', 'pacing', 'right', 'movie', 'audience', 'hostage', 'unshakeable', 'dread', 'entire', 'time.As', 'usual', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'excellent', 'was', 'first', 'real', 'role', 'Oscar', 'nomination-worthy', 'performance', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'role', 'Rachel', 'was', 'originally', 'offered', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'Jennifer', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'dark', 'movie', 'considering', 'second', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Naomi', 'favorite', 'sometimes', 'certain', 'actors', 'seem', 'could', 'fit', 'better', 'certain', 'roles', 'others', 'Jennifer', 'well', 'films', 'where', 'being', 'haunted', 'way', 'digress', 'Naomi', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'matters', 'end.The', 'Ring', 'was', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'put', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'career', 'steady', 'rise.It', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'copy', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'flicks', 'order', 'have', 'decent', 'scary', 'movies', 'American', 'theaters']",N/A

As a lifelong and avid fan of genre films, this has to be one of the most overrated and disappointing movies I have ever seen.  I'm not a horror film elitist, all I ask for is a decent story and at least a few scares or squirms.  To summarize:1. Naomi Watts-superb actor, she can do (and has done) so much better than this (Mulholland Dr., anyone?).2. Plot &amp; story-where are they?  So full of holes you could drain pasta with it (do any screenwriters actually work in Hollywood any longer?  or have they all given up and left the writing duties to the mailroom staff?).  This is VERY puerile stuff here, adults beware.3. Scare factor: on a scale of 1-10, ZERO.  0 suspense, 0 surprises, 0 credibility, and especially, 0 horror.  This film simply is not scary, not at all, never for a moment.4. Mama always told me: never put anything down unless you can come up with a better solution.  SO--here are some recommendations for smart, interesting, intelligent, well-written and especially FRIGHTENING genre/horror films:*The Devil's Backbone (Guillermo Del Toro): now THIS is scary!*Don't Look Now (Nicolas Roeg): the most haunting, beautifully-shot (in Venice) and erotic horror film ever made.  Just try to forget this one.*The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven): visionary and still shocking.*The Haunting (Robert Wise--the original, not the ridiculous modern remake): the best and most frightening ghost story EVER, period.*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper): unrelenting, claustrophobic, sweat-inducing and repulsive.  This is an iconic and endlessly-imitated masterpiece, right up there with George Romero's &quot;Night of the Living Dead.&quot;  The recent remake (if not compared directly to the original) is NOT BAD, actually....*The Mothman Prophecies (Mark Pellington): YUP, believe it or not, this is a tight, though confusing (you absolutely must read the book by John Keel prior to seeing this film) and above all VERY frightening and unsettling bit of business.  Highly recommended for those looking for something different and a bit.....off.*Repulsion (Roman Polanski): The granddaddy....if this one doesn't disturb you on a very deep and lasting level, I would worry.  &quot;Rosemary's Baby,&quot; also Polanski, is another winner and timeless classic.  Actually, ANYTHING Polanski is better than most of what's out there.My humble opinion: check out the movies listed above and avoid &quot;The Ring&quot;--annoying, unnecessarily oblique, and just plain dumb-dumb.

But there are some negative sides to this movie..When i was watching this movie, i thought it was a little like 'The Shining', an awesome Stanley Kubrick film. (Heck, what ISN'T an awesome Stanley Kubrick film?) The ring had the mood of the shining, because it had very strange and graphic images, the plot was dark and eerie, and the photography was just like stan's movies. Lined up to see everything, and staying still for god knows how long. Also it was directed by Gore Verbinski, the man who brought us probably the most annoying and over-rated film of our time, 'Pirates of the Carribean'. I know, even though this came before POTC, it was directed by the same man, so when i watch it NOW, i just cant get that annoying pirate movie out of my mind.And also, even though the movie is great overall, i just couldn't help to say that the opening scene was so cheesy, i need some Ritz crackers for crying out loud. It begins like one of those horror stories you hear at slumber parties, or at your school on halloween or something.

Naomi Watts stars as a reporter whose niece dies mysteriously.  The niece's mother asks Rachel Keller (Watts) to track down the cause.  The director, Gore Verbinski, makes the story move with such impressive camera movements and makes a visually stunning film.While tracking the cause of her niece's death, Rachel Keller hears of the whispered tale of a frightening videotape that causes all that watch it to die seven days later.  She finds that the four kids, including her niece, that watched it, died seven days later.  Stumbling upon the tape in a mountain lodge, Rachel watches it herself and gets a call saying, ""Seven Days . . ."".  With the days narrowing done, Rachel must find the origin of the tape and save herself.  When her child watches the video tape also, the race is on to save their lives.  The film will keep you totally engrossed in every passing second so that your eyes never blink or leave the screen.The DVD isnt that great though.  The picture is superb and as clear as glass.  The sound is also top-notch.  Special Features, this is where the DVD loses power.  The special features are: A never-before-seen short film created by the director with the deleted scenes, trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile, and Catch Me If You Can, and the actual RING videotape seen throughout the film.  You think such a major box office hit would have more features to please its numerous fans.

They stay at an isolated small motel, where the cabins are supplied with VCRs and free videos. The couples select the video from Hell for viewing pleasure. What they see is pure horror. Then a telephone call warns them they will die in seven days. And they do. Katie is found, seven days later, dead, with a look of terror on her face that will give you nightmares for weeks.Katie's Aunt Rachel, (well acted by Naomi Watts), a Seattle reporter, becomes suspicious about the cause of Katie's death when her young son, Aiden, begins drawing disturbing pictures of his cousin's burial. Even more disturbing is that the drawings were made three days prior to the fatal shock that supposedly killed the young woman. The grieving mother, Rachel's sister, asks the investigative reporter to find out who, or what, killed Katie. Rachel discovers that a video exists, previously thought to be urban legend, that actually causes the death of viewers seven days after watching it. All three of the teenagers, who saw the movie with Katie, died on the same day, at the same time.Rachel discovers the video, and, of course, watches it. We get to watch it too. This film within a film is a surreal &amp; ominous vision of evil. Was I scared? You bet! And then the telephone rings. Terrified, Rachel seeks help from her estranged boyfriend Noah, Aiden's father. Disbelieving, and refusing to be deterred, he insists on watching the video also. Rachel only has six more days to find some answers; Noah now has seven. Warning: &quot;Before you die you see the ring!&quot; The suspenseful countdown begins, and tension builds excruciatingly, as more horrifying clues emerge. The realm of the supernatural now becomes reality - a reality of unspeakable fear.Director Gore Verbinski does a magnificent job of bringing Koji Suzuki's book, &quot;Ringu,&quot; vividly to the screen. He knows the source of fear is in the mind. With superb photography, camera shots of macabre images, and freeze frames, the film's ghostlike eeriness begins to work on the viewers mind, and pulse rate. The psychology of this thriller is not based on blood and gore, but on a harrowing blend of the intense storyline, visual effects, and an excellent, but bizarre musical score that encourages feelings of dread. There is so little color in the film, except for a tree's brilliant red leaves, a fiery sunset, blue red drops from a nosebleed, that it could have been shot in muted shades of black and white. These muted monotones increase the supernatural ambiance. Verbinski reveals each layer of mystery slowly, making it impossible to anticipate the horrifying conclusion, and the answer to what the ring represents.The acting is very well done, with excellent performances by Ms. Watts, who is not a screamer, but a level-headed investigator, with a human capacity for fear; young David Dorfman, who really gives some competition to Haley Joel Osment; Brian Cox; and good cameos by Jane Alexander, a calming influence amidst the chaos, and Daveigh Chase, who makes viewers' spines tingle.I don't scare easily, perhaps not since I last saw &quot;The Shining,&quot; but I was scared enough in this well-done movie to rate it 5 stars!",5,&quot;The Ring&quot; Is Right Up Nightmare Alley!,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,3312,"['Katie', 'teenage', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'young', 'couple', 'go', 'away', 'weekend', 'woods', 'Washington', 'State', 'stay', 'isolated', 'small', 'motel', 'where', 'cabins', 'are', 'supplied', 'VCRs', 'free', 'videos', 'couples', 'select', 'video', 'Hell', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'What', 'see', 'pure', 'horror', 'Then', 'telephone', 'call', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'do', 'Katie', 'found', 'seven', 'days', 'later', 'dead', 'look', 'terror', 'face', 'will', 'give', 'nightmares', 'weeks.Katie', 'Aunt', 'Rachel', 'well', 'acted', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Seattle', 'reporter', 'suspicious', 'cause', 'Katie', 'death', 'when', 'young', 'son', 'Aiden', 'drawing', 'disturbing', 'pictures', 'cousin', 'burial', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'drawings', 'were', 'made', 'three', 'days', 'prior', 'fatal', 'shock', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'young', 'woman', 'grieving', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'sister', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'killed', 'Katie', 'Rachel', 'video', 'previously', 'thought', 'be', 'urban', 'legend', 'actually', 'death', 'viewers', 'seven', 'days', 'watching', 'three', 'teenagers', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'Katie', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'same', 'time.Rachel', 'video', 'course', 'get', 'watch', 'too', 'film', 'film', 'surreal', 'amp', 'ominous', 'vision', 'evil', 'Was', 'scared', 'bet', 'then', 'telephone', 'rings', 'Terrified', 'Rachel', 'help', 'estranged', 'boyfriend', 'Noah', 'Aiden', 'father', 'Disbelieving', 'refusing', 'be', 'deterred', 'watching', 'video', 'also', 'Rachel', 'only', 'six', 'more', 'days', 'find', 'answers', 'Noah', 'now', 'seven', 'Warning', 'quot', 'die', 'see', 'ring', 'quot', 'suspenseful', 'countdown', 'begins', 'tension', 'builds', 'excruciatingly', 'more', 'horrifying', 'clues', 'emerge', 'realm', 'supernatural', 'now', 'reality', 'reality', 'unspeakable', 'fear.Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'magnificent', 'job', 'bringing', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'book', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'vividly', 'screen', 'source', 'fear', 'mind', 'superb', 'photography', 'camera', 'shots', 'macabre', 'images', 'freeze', 'frames', 'film', 'ghostlike', 'eeriness', 'work', 'viewers', 'mind', 'pulse', 'rate', 'psychology', 'thriller', 'not', 'based', 'blood', 'gore', 'harrowing', 'blend', 'intense', 'storyline', 'visual', 'effects', 'excellent', 'bizarre', 'musical', 'score', 'feelings', 'dread', 'so', 'little', 'color', 'film', 'tree', 'brilliant', 'red', 'leaves', 'fiery', 'sunset', 'blue', 'red', 'drops', 'nosebleed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'muted', 'shades', 'black', 'white', 'muted', 'monotones', 'increase', 'supernatural', 'ambiance', 'Verbinski', 'layer', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'making', 'impossible', 'anticipate', 'horrifying', 'conclusion', 'answer', 'what', 'ring', 'represents.The', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Ms.', 'Watts', 'who', 'not', 'screamer', 'level-headed', 'investigator', 'human', 'capacity', 'fear', 'young', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'who', 'really', 'competition', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'good', 'cameos', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'calming', 'influence', 'amidst', 'chaos', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'who', 'viewers', 'spines', 'tingle.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'easily', 'perhaps', 'not', 'last', 'saw', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'was', 'scared', 'enough', 'well-done', 'movie', 'rate', '5', 'stars']",N/A

What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined.Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge?The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest. While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals.Highly recommended for all, and enjoy looking for a hidden DVD extra!",4,A refreshing piece for American audiences,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1718,"['Ring', 'started', 'what', 'became', 'wave', 'horror', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'other', 'tales', 'such', 'Grudge', 'were', 'not', 'critically', 'well', 'received', 'Ring', 'truly', 'earned', 'merit', 'audiences.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Seatle', 'reporter', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'aiding', 'sister', 'mysterious', 'death', 'niece', 'death', 'was', 'provoked', 'watching', 'mysterious', 'videotape', 'not', 'following', 'rules', 'order', 'save', 'one', 'life.After', 'seeing', 'tape', 'Rachel', 'horrified', 'learn', 'who', 'see', 'have', 'seven', 'days', 'die', 'somehow', 'manage', 'avoid', 'death', 'performing', 'task', 'spirit', 'haunting', 'tape', 'viewer', 'do', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'full', 'plot', 'now', 'keep', 'unspoiled', 'discover', 'film', 'Rachel', 'help', 'exboyfriend', 'Noah', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'order', 'discover', 'origins', 'mysterious', 'tape', 'too', 'late', 'What', 'Rachel', 'dark', 'hidden', 'story', 'one', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'many', 'small', 'island', 'communities', 'where', 'small', 'girl', 'arrived', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'only', 'cause', 'grief', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'imagined.Has', 'young', 'girl', 'returned', 'seek', 'revenge', 'visual', 'style', 'Ring', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'asset', 'Imagery', 'creepy', 'alluring', 'film', 'dark', 'color', 'palette', 'adding', 'cold', 'wet', 'climate', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'Ring', 'out', 'one', 'better', 'psychological', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'aided', 'unique', 'story', 'strong', 'performances', 'haunting', 'visuals.Highly', 'recommended', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'hidden', 'DVD', 'extra']",N/A
606498,A27RFBMPCWGZSZ,B00005JLTK,Jason Waldman,"[6, 7]","""The Ring"" is different from almost every other horror flick out there today.  There's not a lot of gore in it.  There's no monster, per se.  And there's no big shocks until the very end.Yet it's still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.Yes, ""The Ring"" is one of those rare gems that keeps the suspense and intensity going throughout the film.  From the very beginning scene where two girls talk about watching the tape to the very end, which has a twist that will have you sleeping with the lights on, there is an uneasy tone to the movie that keeps you on edge, waiting to see what happens next.The acting is good in this movie, although the only person you've probably heard of is Naomi Watts, who plays a newspaper reporter who's niece viewed the tape and died seven days later.  She of course views the tape, then gets a chilling phone call that says ""seven days"".  Most of the rest of the film has to do with her trying to find out where the tape came from and how to prevent her from dying.  Her ex-boyfriend assists in the endeavor, just slightly lightening the mood at times.As I said the tone is very dark.  Unlike a lot of horror movies, which have some comic relief, there is nary a chuckle to be found in this one.  Much of this movie is disturbing, especially when they discover the horrible secret of the tape.  You sort of create a lot of your own fear here, because you almost always expect something bad to happen every time a character makes a move.  That adds to the tension and is one of the reasons why I liked this film so much.  You scare yourself more than this movie scares you just by thinking about it.This is definitely a ""must-own"" DVD if you're a horror movie fan, and the extras look well worth the price.  Finding out more about the legend of the tape and getting to see it, uncut, for yourself is a great bonus.  And, like me when I saw the movie in theaters, you'll have a nerve-wracking week after you see this, wondering if the legend is really true.",5,A Nice Ode to Past Horror Movies,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,1997,"['Ring', 'different', 'almost', 'other', 'horror', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'not', 'lot', 'gore', 'monster', 'se', 'big', 'shocks', 'very', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Yes', 'Ring', 'one', 'rare', 'gems', 'suspense', 'intensity', 'going', 'film', 'very', 'beginning', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'talk', 'watching', 'tape', 'very', 'end', 'twist', 'will', 'have', 'sleeping', 'lights', 'uneasy', 'tone', 'movie', 'edge', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'next.The', 'acting', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'person', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'niece', 'viewed', 'tape', 'died', 'seven', 'days', 'later', 'course', 'views', 'tape', 'then', 'chilling', 'phone', 'call', 'seven', 'days', 'Most', 'rest', 'film', 'do', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'tape', 'came', 'how', 'prevent', 'dying', 'ex-boyfriend', 'assists', 'endeavor', 'just', 'slightly', 'lightening', 'mood', 'times.As', 'said', 'tone', 'very', 'dark', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'comic', 'relief', 'nary', 'chuckle', 'be', 'found', 'one', 'Much', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'when', 'discover', 'horrible', 'secret', 'tape', 'sort', 'create', 'lot', 'own', 'fear', 'here', 'almost', 'always', 'expect', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'time', 'character', 'move', 'tension', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'liked', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'scare', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'thinking', 'it.This', 'definitely', 'must-own', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'extras', 'look', 'well', 'price', 'Finding', 'out', 'more', 'legend', 'tape', 'getting', 'see', 'uncut', 'great', 'bonus', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'nerve-wracking', 'week', 'see', 'wondering', 'legend', 'really', 'true']",N/A
606499,A69Z3F9A2ILNP,B00005JLTK,Jay,"[0, 1]","The Ring was an interesting mix of urban legend, psychological thriller, and rip-offs of other horror/suspense movies.  Because I watch a lot of them, I had to pick up this DVD.  I did not have the chance to see it in theatres, so my first viewing was just a week ago while lying in bed one evening.  There are images that have still stuck with me.  I loved it!Director Gore Verbinski did an excellent job with a cast that we would not usually recognize...this helps because they have not been fixed as other characters in our minds.  The horror of ""The Ring"" is the suspense.  After watching a video, people are told they have seven days to live through an anonymous phone call.  When people start dying, those who have watched the video since, begin to take notice.  Intrigued by solving the mystery of where the video came from, a doomed investigative reporter follows the clues to the video's source.  This is where an interesting turn takes place that took me from sadness and empathy to fear as I honestly had chills.The DVD menu is themed with the video from the film.  Bonus features have titles like ""Look Here"" and ""Don't Watch This"".  After viewing the film, you may have a hard time deciding to view segments with such warnings, but they were well worth it.  One is a trailer for the original film, ""Ringu"", which ""The Ring"" was based on.  The other is a short film of what appear to be deleted scenes.  Many times it is easy to see why deleted scenes were taken out in the first place (they are boring and add little to the story).  On the other hand, these scenes invite the audience in on some interesting information that changes what you thought you knew about the characters...very interesting.Why 5 Stars?:For no other reason than this movie gave me chills that have stuck with me for a week would I have to give it this rating.  Furthermore, young Daveigh Chase won an MTV Movie Award for being the scariest villain and you will see why.  The thrill of joining the characters as they try to solve the mystery of ""The Ring"" should be a highlight in the DVD library of fans of ghost stories...that is, those of us who like to get a good scare every now and then.",5,An Interesting Mix,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,2180,"['Ring', 'was', 'interesting', 'mix', 'urban', 'legend', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'rip-offs', 'other', 'horror/suspense', 'movies', 'watch', 'lot', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'theatres', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'just', 'week', 'ago', 'lying', 'bed', 'one', 'evening', 'are', 'images', 'have', 'still', 'stuck', 'loved', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'cast', 'would', 'not', 'usually', 'recognize', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'fixed', 'other', 'characters', 'minds', 'horror', 'Ring', 'suspense', 'watching', 'video', 'people', 'are', 'told', 'have', 'seven', 'days', 'live', 'anonymous', 'phone', 'call', 'When', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'video', 'begin', 'take', 'notice', 'Intrigued', 'solving', 'mystery', 'where', 'video', 'came', 'doomed', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'clues', 'video', 'source', 'where', 'interesting', 'turn', 'place', 'took', 'sadness', 'empathy', 'fear', 'honestly', 'had', 'chills.The', 'DVD', 'menu', 'themed', 'video', 'film', 'Bonus', 'features', 'have', 'titles', 'Look', 'Here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Watch', 'viewing', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'deciding', 'view', 'segments', 'such', 'warnings', 'were', 'well', 'worth', 'One', 'trailer', 'original', 'film', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'was', 'based', 'other', 'short', 'film', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Many', 'times', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'boring', 'add', 'little', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'scenes', 'invite', 'audience', 'interesting', 'information', 'what', 'thought', 'knew', 'characters', 'very', 'interesting.Why', '5', 'Stars', 'other', 'reason', 'movie', 'gave', 'have', 'stuck', 'week', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'rating', 'Furthermore', 'young', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'won', 'MTV', 'Movie', 'Award', 'being', 'scariest', 'villain', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'thrill', 'joining', 'characters', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Ring', 'should', 'be', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'library', 'fans', 'ghost', 'stories', 'who', 'like', 'get', 'good', 'scare', 'now', 'then']",N/A

If you know nothing about the movie and like scary flicks, don't finish reading this review and never read any review.  Just watch the thing alone and at night...at 2 in the morning would be good.I thought this movie ranks up there with The Exorcist and Psycho.  This is truly a horror classic.  Now, that being said, I've seen reviews in which people have felt it being ""a typical horror movie"" and not all that scary.  Of course, I also know people that thought The Exorcist was campy and good for a laugh.  For me, though, there was tension through out the whole movie, which kept building and building, and I nearly wet myself during THE scene.I'll admit I happened to watch this thing at about 2 in the morning and was, as I stated, unaware of the good reviews this thing had.

606504,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JLTK,Jeffrey Leach,"[141, 159]","""The Ring"" is an American adaptation of the 1998 Japanese horror film called ""Ringu."" The plot is hideously simple: a videotape floating around kills anyone who watches it at the end of seven days. We know this because after the poor viewer gets to the end of the film, the phone ""rings"" and a voice whispers ""seven days."" A week later, someone finds the body of the viewer dead as a doornail with horribly swollen facial features. During the final week of life, people who watched the tape suffer from unpleasant hallucinations and nosebleeds. If this sounds like an urban legend to you, you're right on the money. But when this urban legend appears in the form of a movie like ""The Ring,"" it blows hooks hanging off doors or ghostly hitchhikers right out of the water. This movie is full of creepy shocks, claustrophobic atmosphere, and hidden symbols and clues. It even has Naomi Watts, the blond babe from Lynch's schizophrenic ""Mulholland Drive"" as the main character.The beginning of the film pulls no punches. Katie and her friend Rebecca are discussing the effects of electromagnetic waves on the human brain when an offhand comment about a videotape that kills comes to the fore. Katie looks fearful as she confesses to her friend that, indeed, she saw the tape in a cabin with some friends. After some playful hijinks, we discover that Katie really did see the tape as we catch a quick glimpse of her final moments of life. This tragedy brings into the story her enigmatic cousin Aidan and his mother, a reporter for a Seattle newspaper named Rachel. At the request of Katie's mother, Rachel begins to investigate the videotape, a task that assumes dire proportions after Rachel watches the tape and realizes she might die in a week's time. What follows is a race against impending doom, a doom that assumes additional dimensions when Rachel's acquaintance Noah and her son Aidan watch the video.Research into the tape unearths one strange turn after another. A woman who appears in the tape turns out to be one Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who went insane after adopting a little girl named Samara. Moreover, the images Rachel saw on the tape continue to turn up during her investigations. As the mystery slowly unravels, many questions arise. Who is Samara and what is her connection with this dreadful videotape? Is this frightening little girl a ghost who chooses to haunt through the processes of media instead of rattling chains in a house? How can misery transfer itself to an inanimate object? And my personal query, did anyone else find Aidan as eerie as Samara?One thing is certain: repeated viewings of this film are most helpful. One time through won't do the trick with this movie. You must be patient and pay attention because the answers are do not come easy. I think too many people expected an undemanding slasher film instead of this suspenseful, downbeat exercise in cerebral terror. I for one welcome these fresh attempts to deepen the horror genre. Gory exploitation films and teenage stalker movies certainly have a place (consider how Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers are now a permanent part of our pop culture), but for those of us who want something deeper and darker to strike us insensate, ""The Ring"" delivers the goods. The scene where Noah experiences what really happens when one's seven day waiting period expires will stay with me for a long time, and it was all done without a knife, axe, machete, power tool, or whatever else horror film murderers are using to dispatch their victims with these days. I haven't been this unsettled by a little girl since the twins in Kubrick's ""The Shining."" ""The Ring"" hits a home run on several levels.The DVD version, with wonderful sound and a great picture enhanced the horrific aspects of the film. Included on the version I watched was a trailer for the original ""Ringu"" and deleted scenes that provide additional information about the mysteries of the film, including a chilling alternate ending. Regrettably, there were no commentaries or behind the scenes clips for the movie, although one imagines that a ""Special Edition"" will soon appear containing such things (for extra dollars, of course). If the Japanese public's response to ""Ringu"" is any indication, expect a sequel to ""The Ring"" in our country within a year or two. Sequels often do serious damage to the original picture, but if more films take us deeper into the mysterious realm that is Samara, I welcome them with open arms.",5,"Brainy Horror, Nicely Done",1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,4477,"['Ring', 'American', 'adaptation', '1998', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'called', 'Ringu', 'plot', 'hideously', 'simple', 'videotape', 'floating', 'kills', 'anyone', 'who', 'end', 'seven', 'days', 'know', 'poor', 'viewer', 'end', 'film', 'phone', 'rings', 'voice', 'whispers', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'later', 'someone', 'body', 'viewer', 'dead', 'doornail', 'horribly', 'swollen', 'facial', 'features', 'final', 'week', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'tape', 'suffer', 'unpleasant', 'hallucinations', 'nosebleeds', 'urban', 'legend', ""'re"", 'right', 'money', 'when', 'urban', 'legend', 'form', 'movie', 'Ring', 'hooks', 'hanging', 'off', 'doors', 'ghostly', 'hitchhikers', 'right', 'water', 'movie', 'full', 'creepy', 'shocks', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'hidden', 'symbols', 'clues', 'even', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'blond', 'babe', 'Lynch', 'schizophrenic', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'main', 'character.The', 'beginning', 'film', 'punches', 'Katie', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'are', 'discussing', 'effects', 'electromagnetic', 'waves', 'human', 'brain', 'when', 'offhand', 'comment', 'videotape', 'fore', 'Katie', 'fearful', 'friend', 'indeed', 'saw', 'tape', 'cabin', 'friends', 'playful', 'hijinks', 'discover', 'Katie', 'really', 'did', 'see', 'tape', 'catch', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'final', 'moments', 'life', 'tragedy', 'story', 'enigmatic', 'cousin', 'Aidan', 'mother', 'reporter', 'Seattle', 'newspaper', 'named', 'Rachel', 'request', 'Katie', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'investigate', 'videotape', 'task', 'dire', 'proportions', 'Rachel', 'tape', 'might', 'die', 'week', 'time', 'What', 'race', 'impending', 'doom', 'doom', 'additional', 'dimensions', 'when', 'Rachel', 'acquaintance', 'Noah', 'son', 'Aidan', 'watch', 'video.Research', 'tape', 'unearths', 'one', 'strange', 'turn', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'tape', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'Anna', 'Morgan', 'horse', 'breeder', 'who', 'went', 'insane', 'adopting', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Samara', 'Moreover', 'images', 'Rachel', 'saw', 'tape', 'continue', 'turn', 'up', 'investigations', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'unravels', 'many', 'questions', 'arise', 'Who', 'Samara', 'what', 'connection', 'dreadful', 'videotape', 'frightening', 'little', 'girl', 'ghost', 'who', 'haunt', 'processes', 'media', 'instead', 'rattling', 'chains', 'house', 'How', 'can', 'misery', 'transfer', 'inanimate', 'object', 'personal', 'query', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'find', 'Aidan', 'as', 'eerie', 'Samara', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'helpful', 'One', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'trick', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'patient', 'pay', 'attention', 'answers', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'easy', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'expected', 'undemanding', 'slasher', 'film', 'instead', 'suspenseful', 'downbeat', 'exercise', 'cerebral', 'terror', 'one', 'welcome', 'fresh', 'attempts', 'deepen', 'horror', 'genre', 'Gory', 'exploitation', 'films', 'teenage', 'stalker', 'movies', 'certainly', 'have', 'place', 'consider', 'how', 'Jason', 'Freddy', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'are', 'now', 'permanent', 'part', 'pop', 'culture', 'who', 'want', 'something', 'deeper', 'darker', 'strike', 'insensate', 'Ring', 'goods', 'scene', 'where', 'Noah', 'what', 'really', 'when', 'one', 'seven', 'day', 'waiting', 'period', 'expires', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'knife', 'axe', 'machete', 'power', 'tool', 'else', 'horror', 'film', 'murderers', 'are', 'using', 'dispatch', 'victims', 'days', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'unsettled', 'little', 'girl', 'twins', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'Ring', 'home', 'run', 'several', 'levels.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'wonderful', 'sound', 'great', 'picture', 'enhanced', 'horrific', 'aspects', 'film', 'Included', 'version', 'watched', 'was', 'trailer', 'original', 'Ringu', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'provide', 'additional', 'information', 'mysteries', 'film', 'including', 'chilling', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Regrettably', 'were', 'commentaries', 'scenes', 'clips', 'movie', 'one', 'imagines', 'Special', 'Edition', 'will', 'soon', 'appear', 'containing', 'such', 'things', 'extra', 'dollars', 'course', 'Japanese', 'public', 'response', 'Ringu', 'indication', 'expect', 'sequel', 'Ring', 'country', 'year', 'two', 'Sequels', 'often', 'do', 'serious', 'damage', 'original', 'picture', 'more', 'films', 'take', 'deeper', 'mysterious', 'realm', 'Samara', 'welcome', 'open', 'arms']",N/A

During the final week, the victims suffer from terrifying hallucinations and nose bleeds.At the beginning, two friends, Katie and Rebecca, are watching TV when Katie reveals that she has seen the mysterious video.  True to its nature, Katie ends up dying at the hands of the video, while Rebecca, being so traumitized from witnessing Katie's death, is committed to a mental institution.  Katie's death brings in her cousin Aidan and his mom Rachel (Watts), a reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer.  Katie's mother requests that Rachel investigate the story behind the video.  The task becomes harder when Rachel watches the video herself and then realizes she may die within a week.A race against time soon develops, as Rachel, Aidan, and Rachel's estranged boyfriend Noah seek to unlock the mystery of the tape.As Rachel conducts her research, more and more questions arise.  A woman who appears in the video turns out to be Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who goes insane after adopting a young girl named Samara.  Also, the images on the tape continue to turn up during the investigation.  What will become of Rachel's investigation?  What is Samara's connection to the story?  Will Rachel die after seven days like Katie did?This is a scary yet thought-provoking film, however, I recommend watching it at least twice.  I found myself lost during certain parts, but with a second viewing, any questions should be cleared up.

Sure Jason and Freddy were kind of creepy and could come up with some really interesting ways to kill people, but there was just something about them that didn't scare me and keep me up all night.  The movies that always scared me were the ones that messed with your head and you couldn't figure out what in the hell was happening.  &quot;The Ring&quot; is definitely one of those kinds of movies.A brief summary of the plot is easy to do.  There's a videotape and if you watch it, you will die.  You watch it, then the phone rings, and then a spooky voice tells you that you have seven days to live.  That's a freaky enough premise as it is, but when Naomi Watts' character starts trying to decipher the tape and figure out what it means, the events that follow just makes things even more bizarre.I didn't see &quot;The Ring&quot; when it was in theaters, but I heard all the buzz about it.  I watched the movie as soon as it came out on DVD and there were some very disturbing things going on in this movie.  Everytime you think your getting closer to figuring out what the deal with the videotape is, something happens and some of it is truly unnerving (ie. the bath one of the characters takes at the end or the horse on the boat).  Plus, just when I thought the movie was done and everything had been resolved, I looked at the counter on my DVD player and realized that there's still another fifteen minutes of movie left.

All of these untalented writers and directors are just remaking films. Where are the original ideas!!! I mean seriously remaking Japanese horror movies... is Hollywood that desperate? Then again we almost remade every movie in the past 10 years, so we have to look at foreign films. Pathetic, which leads me to this awful movie ""The Ring"". First off the idea of watching a tape is extremeley cheezy. Not a good plot right off the bat....The ring was such a rip off of other horror movies such as the sixth sense. For example, there is always that child who knows too much and is ridiculously smart. In the ring Naomi Watts's son acts like hes a business man even though hes like 9 years old. He hears voices and can speak to the dead for some reason abd Forget about the ending it was so predictable. I won't give it away I'll let you horror fans witness this terrible ending. I don't think the horror fans today appreciate early horror movies such as the original texas chainsaw massacre, the last house on the left, motel hell...i mean those movies actually kept you on the edge of your seat. They actually captured suspense, unlike these pg-13 teen flicks. that also leads me to another dispute, all horror movies are rated pg-13 for some reason, gee i wonder why...MONEY! I remember once upon a time when screen writers only cared about portraying their idea on the big screen. The scripts nowadays are just shot out in less than  30 days, slap a pg-13 rating, add some scary music. Wrong!

Since it is both a remake and a horror movie, I didn't think that this was something that I would enjoy.  I rented the movie anyway.  One thing to note about this movie is that it is more of a suspense thriller than horror.  It was creepy, but not that scary.  It was also quite good.The premise of the movie is that there is a video tape going around and if you watch it, you will die in 7 days.  It is passed off as an urban legend and as a joke, but a teenaged girl died mysteriously.  The mother asks her friend Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a reporter, to investigate.  Rachel learns that the girl's boyfriend died at the exact same time, but in an unrelated manner.  She also learns that a couple of other kids, all friends, died at the exact same time on the same day and that they had all supposedly watched this video together.  Rachel travels up to the cabin they stayed at and finds a tape that they might have watched.  She watches the tape and it is creepy and weird and she can't look away until the tape ends.  Rachel is scared and the phone rings.  When she answers it she hears a voice say, ""Seven days.""Now freaked out and thinking that she is going to die in seven days, Rachel frantically investigates the origins of this tape trying to find out the truth and also how this came about.  I had expected a kind of blood and guts movie where massive amounts of people are dropping dead after watching a videotape.  Instead, this is a fairly intelligent and well done thriller regarding an investigation into a mysterious videotape.  The video is creepy, and I was surprised by how good this movie was.

I came across it on a business trip in London and learned later that it was kept out of the US when Dreamworks bought the rights for an American remake - which is a bit of a shame because the original tends to be a bit ""ruined"" by those who see the remake first (spoilers have already been exposed, as it were, and horror suffers greatly when the ending is spoiled). Also, the slick production values of ""The (American) Ring"" ($48 million) tend to ""take away from"" instead of ""add to"" the suspension of disbelief that Nakata's small production achieves.

Not since Blair Witch and to a lesser extend, Jacob's Ladder has a movie like this creeped me out.  Taking itself completely seriously, there are no moments of humour and that contributes to the crawling terror.  In a gritty, almost monochrome colored setting, four teens die a week after watching a mysterious video tape.  The tape falls into the hands of a reporter, one of the kids' Aunt, who is trying to find out why her niece died.  She watches the tape as does her sensitive son and the boys estranged father.  She is told by the mysterious phone call that she now has 7 days to live.  The race is then on to solve the mystery of this tape, its origins and its demonic hold on the viewers.  Slowly, like an onion, the movies' layers are stripped away with hallucinogenic imagery and strange revelations.  The protagonists start their research on the NET, move to moldy public library sources, and ultimately to insane asylum records.

The Ring is about this mysterious video that kills you in seven days after viewing it. The lead actress Naiomi Watts plays as a news reporter who tries to uncover the mystery of the tape when her niece mysteriously dies seven days after watching it. This is scary and will give you nightmares after watching it.

I just want to talk about a few things.I generally like this movie.  It's a good story, spooky, suspenseful, dark, and gloomy.  I think the best thing this movie has going for it is the atmosphere.  There is seemingly a never-ending overcast sky for the entire movie.  I think this creates a consistent spooky atmosphere.  The other thing this movie has going for it is that it's scary and suspenseful most of the time.  Naomi Watts?  She's perfect in her role.  Another thing - the music by Hans Zimmer is highly effective and fits in with what is on the screen.  This music is not overpowering.  Instead, it's very low volume, subtle, and delicate.One thing that just jumped out at me was that this movie borrowed from The Omen (1976 & 2006) and The Changeling (1980).  Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.  Also, the girl with the hair over her eyes who was thrown into the well looks a lot like Regan from The Exorcist (1973) did when she was possessed.Overall, this is a pretty good flick that I rate at 3 1/2 stars.",3,3 1/2 stars for The Ring,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1172,"['want', 'make', 'review', 'are', '1,000', 'reviews', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'read', 'really', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'plot', 'just', 'want', 'talk', 'few', 'things.I', 'generally', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'spooky', 'suspenseful', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'atmosphere', 'seemingly', 'never-ending', 'overcast', 'sky', 'entire', 'movie', 'think', 'consistent', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'time', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'perfect', 'role', 'thing', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'highly', 'effective', 'fits', 'what', 'screen', 'music', 'not', 'overpowering', 'Instead', 'very', 'low', 'volume', 'subtle', 'delicate.One', 'thing', 'just', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'movie', 'borrowed', 'Omen', '1976', '2006', 'Changeling', '1980', 'Watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Also', 'girl', 'hair', 'eyes', 'who', 'was', 'thrown', 'well', 'lot', 'Regan', 'Exorcist', '1973', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'possessed.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'flick', 'rate', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

She watches the tape, which forces her to find the origin of the tape and end the curse. The Ring is a scary and entraining film.The story in this film is scary and creative like the original film, Ringu. However, The Ring does expand on the ideas and scenes of the original film, in turn, adding more details to the story and a couple of jump scares; also adding around 15 minutes to the original film's runtime, excluding credits. This film is a bit more graphic, and louder. The tape isn't as realistic as the original, but creepy, nonetheless. Samara is also more reliant on make-up and special effects. Don't get me wrong, these additions don't significantly hurt the film, but they do make The Ring a more obvious, or blatant, horror film; on the other hand, the atmosphere in Ringu created a suspenseful, creepy feeling of ambiguous horror. The horror in this film is welcomed, I don't mind the different types of horror films. The acting was great, and I enjoyed the film's cinematography.The Blu-ray version of this film has great picture and audio quality; the film looks amazing. It has a few special features including interviews, theatrical trailers, and ""Rings"" and ""Don't Watch This"" featurettes.

I liked it better on DVD, realizing that the film itself is meant to be almost as surreal, nightmarish, and dreamlike as the short videotape that troubles everyone during the course of the story.  To that end, everything isn't neatly explained, as the movie is mainly about imagery and mood than linear, coherent story telling.  I should add, though, that I agree with other reviewers here that if you watch and listen closely, you are given everything you need to get a satisfying sense of what's going on.Also worth a look on the DVD is the short companion film by director Gore Verbinski that delves deeper into the events of ""The Ring"".  In actuality, the short film is essentially the movie's deleted scenes, intercut with shots from the scary videotape.  But it's all done quite skillfully, and it gives you more details about the main characters, as well as some surprising fates to characters we only saw for a scene or two in the movie's final cut (for example, there was originally a good bit more with the guy who rented out the cabin to the teenagers).  Also fun to see is a short trailer to the original Japanese horror film, ""Ringu"", of which ""The Ring"" is the American remake.Let me conclude my throwing some kudos to Naomi Watts, who gives a subtle, nuanced performance in ""The Ring"", yet also knows when simple terror and blood-curdling screams are the things that are called for in certain scenes.

606530,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JLTK,Josh Hitchens,"[0, 3]","Based upon a Japanese horror film, ""The Ring"" is an extremely well-made example of a psychologically harrowing movie. This film disturbed me more than any I have ever seen, and I can't explain why. I can only say that it haunted me for days after I had seen it, and I was unable to get it out of my head. I wasn't frightened by ""The Ring,"" it disturbed me on a far deeper level than that. It wasn't the film's ""you will die in seven days"" premise, I know that.Directed by Gore Verbinski, ""The Ring"" tells the story of a cursed videotape that causes the death of anyone who views it. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a hard-nosed reporter raising a young child on her own. She starts investigating the grisly unexplained deaths of several local teenagers, all of who had watched the cursed video. Rachel tracks down a copy and watches it herself. Immediately afterwards, the phone rings, and the voice of a little girl says ""seven days."" The remainder of the movie is a race against time, as Rachel tries to decode the video's terrifying imagery before she dies. Her investigation is aided by her friend and father of her child, Noah, played by Martin Henderson. Together they slowly begin to solve the mystery of the tape, which involves insanity, suicide, and a very disturbed little girl.A big part of why ""The Ring"" works so well is the exceptional performance of Naomi Watts. She commits fully to the character of Rachel, infusing her with depth and complexity. This makes the film's story much easier to believe, since Watts is so convincing. Martin Henderson, previously seen in the Indie comedy ""The Opposite of Sex,"" is solid as Noah, and Brian Cox is chilling in the supporting role of Robert Morgan. Daveigh Chase is unbelievably creepy as the malevolent Samara, and the actor playing Rachel's young son Aiden also does a credible job.Gore Verbinski is skilled at creating an atnosphere of almost perpetual dread, aided by cold, ominous cinematography.

The same effect was not put upon me, but it was definitely thought provoking and I left the theater with the creepiest feeling.The plot is known by mostly anyone, and it's known that The Ring is a remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu. Gore Verbinski's direction was very effective. Had to be to scare the daylights out of everyone. His use of mixing subtle blues and blacks fit the films mood, and enhanced my mood while watching it. Naomi Watts succeeds at her character for I was involved thoroughly with it throughout the entire movie. Martin Henderson also pulls through as the side character. The subplot dealing with his and Watts' character was effective. And David Dorfman who played Aidan, the little kid, was quite creepy. His eyes did a lot of the acting. Great performance.The DVD release is a bit of a letdown. It's near barebones with only one feature and a string of 3 trailers (Although one is for Ringu). The one feature - the new short film that was much hyped - is a combination of deleted scenes mixed in with the actual video tape. It's a good watch, but doesn't reveal anything new. I'd rather have seen the deleted scenes in the normal format. But hey, where is the theatrical trailer for The Ring itself?!After the major success The Ring has had in just its first day of sales (2 million copies in 24 hours), a special edition is expected.

Unlike The Grudge, which was directed by the same director as the Japanese version, this is a very different story from the Japanese (although there is a quick reference to the Japanese version).There is a rumor of a videotape that can kill people.  If you watch it you will get a phone call and be told you will die in seven days.  When a reporter's niece dies the reporter starts to look into the story.  First she finds out her niece had a secret boyfriend.  Then she finds out the boyfriend died at the same moment as the niece.  There is definitely something strange going on.  As the reporter digs through the story she discovers others died at the same time.  Then she learns about, and finds, the videotape.  She watches it before believing it.But soon the reporter does believe, but not before showing it to her ex.  She starts to become frantic with trying to find a way to break the curse and that means learning more about it.  But when her son watches the videotape she really begins to panic.  Now she not only has to solve the mystery for herself, but for her son.  Her son seems to have some connection to the video and its images and it somehow revolves around a young girl.  It becomes a race against time and the reporter finds a way she thinks will stop the curse.  Will she succeed?  Will she save the ones she loves?  Watch and find out.The videotape in Ringu makes more sense to me than the one here but the story has been rewritten in such a way as to make it work.  Here we have a film that kept the core of the original (the videotape, the ring, and the force behind the curse) and recrafted it into more than just an adaptation.

After that, I didn't see another horror movie until Middle School in the early 90's, I saw Friday The 13th part 7. After seeing Friday the 13th, I started really liking horror movies and started watching everything from Stephen King, every Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, a lot more that aren't so popular and of course the Halloween movies. I was able to watch horror movies for years and years without being affected really. It was to the point that some horror movies were just putting me to sleep because they weren't scary. That is, until I saw The Ring and The Ring Two!I saw The Ring in the theatre and from that first time, it scared me to death. I literally jumped during many scenes and after it was over, it wasn't really over for me. That night after I got back home, I couldn't sleep with the light off. I didn't want to see any static on my TV because I was so scared. My friend who I saw it with kept mentioning a static TV just to scare me and it worked. I have also had a few nightmares about Samara coming after me since I saw The Ring and especially, The Ring Two. The scariest thing that has happened to me was right after I saw The Ring Two in the theatre and that evening after I fell asleep, I swear I heard Samara speaking to me!! I swear it!!! It was her same voice that you hear in The Ring and it was like she was talking right in my ear!! The only thing I actually heard her say was the very first thing and very last thing she said. I heard her talking for a while but everything in the middle, I just didn't understand because it was like I was half awake and half asleep. All I was able to hear her say was ""I never sleep because I'm not dead yet"" and the very last thing she said was ""wake up."" After this happened, I decided to get rid of The Ring DVD, Rings DVD and not even buy The Ring Two because apparently, these films are going to just scare me to where I'll be terrified for the rest of my life!!You know that saying, be careful what you wish for because you might just get it? Well I got a lot more than I wished for all right!!! For years before The Ring came out, I was wishing for a horror movie that would really scare me and this movie scaring me is an understatement!! I never wanted to be scared so bad by having nightmares!! Just the other day, I was watching The Travel Channel and there was this show on about different haunted places and this one mansion was built by an Opera singer who used to perform in her house to people and I thought it was interesting and it didn't scare me in the least UNTIL they had to show the Opera singer's ghost and the ghost looked EXACTLY like Samara, had her long black hair over her face like Samara and she started walking toward the camera which meant, towards me as well. For a second I was freaking out thinking she was going to come out of the TV!!! Before she got too close, I covered my eyes and then they showed another part in the mansion and I just changed the channel!! I think the part that freaks me out the most is when Samara is out of the well and coming toward the TV and in The Ring Two when you see her climbing the well, that creepy way she climbs the well!! For some reason, I cannot get those visions out of my head!!! So to say this movie is still affecting me to this day is a HUGE understatement!!! The thing I just cannot understand is WHY any other horror movie just either puts me to sleep or just wonderful to watch because of the acting or just cool to watch?? I'll NEVER understand what it is about Samara and The Ring and The Ring Two that just terrifies me!! Maybe it's the static TV and the fear of Samara actually coming out of the TV!",5,The ONLY horror movies that give me nightmares!!!,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,3791,"['Back', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'Elementary', 'School', 'saw', 'very', 'first', 'horror', 'movie', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'part', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'Middle', 'School', 'early', '90', 'saw', 'Friday', '13th', 'part', '7', 'seeing', 'Friday', '13th', 'started', 'really', 'liking', 'horror', 'movies', 'started', 'watching', 'everything', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', 'lot', 'more', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'popular', 'course', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'years', 'years', 'being', 'affected', 'really', 'was', 'point', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'just', 'putting', 'sleep', 'were', ""n't"", 'scary', 'saw', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'Two', 'saw', 'Ring', 'theatre', 'first', 'time', 'scared', 'death', 'literally', 'jumped', 'many', 'scenes', 'was', 'over', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'night', 'got', 'back', 'home', 'could', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'light', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'static', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'scared', 'friend', 'who', 'saw', 'kept', 'mentioning', 'static', 'TV', 'just', 'scare', 'worked', 'have', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'nightmares', 'Samara', 'coming', 'saw', 'Ring', 'especially', 'Ring', 'Two', 'scariest', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'right', 'saw', 'Ring', 'Two', 'theatre', 'evening', 'fell', 'asleep', 'swear', 'heard', 'Samara', 'speaking', 'swear', 'was', 'same', 'voice', 'hear', 'Ring', 'was', 'was', 'talking', 'right', 'ear', 'only', 'thing', 'actually', 'heard', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'thing', 'very', 'last', 'thing', 'said', 'heard', 'talking', 'while', 'everything', 'middle', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'was', 'half', 'awake', 'half', 'asleep', 'was', 'able', 'hear', 'say', 'was', 'never', 'sleep', ""'m"", 'not', 'dead', 'yet', 'very', 'last', 'thing', 'said', 'was', 'wake', 'up', 'happened', 'decided', 'get', 'rid', 'Ring', 'DVD', 'Rings', 'DVD', 'not', 'even', 'buy', 'Ring', 'Two', 'apparently', 'films', 'are', 'going', 'just', 'scare', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'terrified', 'rest', 'life', 'know', 'saying', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'Well', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'wished', 'right', 'years', 'Ring', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'wishing', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'really', 'scare', 'movie', 'scaring', 'understatement', 'never', 'wanted', 'be', 'scared', 'so', 'bad', 'having', 'nightmares', 'Just', 'other', 'day', 'was', 'watching', 'Travel', 'Channel', 'was', 'show', 'different', 'haunted', 'places', 'one', 'mansion', 'was', 'built', 'Opera', 'singer', 'who', 'used', 'perform', 'house', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'least', 'UNTIL', 'had', 'show', 'Opera', 'singer', 'ghost', 'ghost', 'looked', 'EXACTLY', 'Samara', 'had', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'face', 'Samara', 'started', 'walking', 'camera', 'meant', 'towards', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'was', 'freaking', 'out', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'TV', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'covered', 'eyes', 'then', 'showed', 'part', 'mansion', 'just', 'changed', 'channel', 'think', 'part', 'most', 'when', 'Samara', 'well', 'coming', 'TV', 'Ring', 'Two', 'when', 'see', 'climbing', 'well', 'way', 'well', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'visions', 'head', 'So', 'say', 'movie', 'still', 'affecting', 'day', 'HUGE', 'understatement', 'thing', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'WHY', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'either', 'sleep', 'just', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'acting', 'just', 'cool', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'NEVER', 'understand', 'what', 'Samara', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'Two', 'just', 'Maybe', 'static', 'TV', 'fear', 'Samara', 'actually', 'coming', 'TV']",N/A

""The Ring"" is much more. Another reviewer called it a cerebral exercise in terror. Exactly! What could have been so hokey became excellent frisson (that thrilling moment that makes your hair prickle).First, the premise: An urban legend that watching this particular video, receiving a phone call immediately after watching will cause your death in exactly seven days. Don't we pooh-pooh urban legends? ""The Ring"" makes us consider their validity.Second, the video itself. Where did it come from? Who made it? How? Why? So many questions, none answered, ever.Third, again the video. What do the scenes represent? The strange, surreal images?That brings in Naomi Watts' character, a reporter doubly bound in the story, first through her son, not unlike the boy in ""The Sixth Sense"" with his sixth sense for the supernatural. Aiden is definitely attuned to the other world.Secondly, Rachal is bound to the story through her research. Her niece watched the movie and died horribly seven days later. Rachal first watches the tape, then begins investigating the images. One by one she peels off the layers of this gothic mystery/puzzle/freakshow.Rachal's appearance in the movie parallels the changes with the story. At the beginning she is frankly beautiful, cool and assured. As revelations unfold and she begins to experience frisson, she begins a shift in appearance, becoming rumpled. By movie's end she is almost gray, as if psychologically preparing to join the urban legend dead.The viewer's frisson builds. The ending is a nightmare. ""The Ring"" is definitely a cerebral experience in terror.SPOILER ALERT:One of those fast flashes of film reveals this: ""Live birth."" An intriguing bit of information that many viewers and reviewers missed or I misinterpreted.

606542,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JLTK,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 4]","Gore Verbinski's THE RING is the classic example of a film that is all style and very little, if any, substance. Verbinski certainly knows how to make a creepy horror film: this film is laced with atmosphere and dread and gray skies. Technically, it is quite impressive. It's too bad that all the skillful visuals are put in the service of a really dumb plot---or, at least, that's the way it turns out. Perhaps the idea of a videotape killing people could make a good horror film---but when the screenplay by Ehren Kruger starts trying to explain how the videotape was made and then how to dilute the videotape's power, this movie just became plain stupid for me. How could anyone be duped into blindly accepting this kind of silliness? I suppose, though, that that is a very subjective reaction and that some people might find its visuals and atmosphere effective enough to accept the film without a second thought. Still, I remember that John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN never really provided an explanation for Michael Myers' motives (except, of course, that &quot;he's crazy&quot;), and I think that perhaps horror movies shouldn't be so burdened with having to explain the horror in them---it should merely be felt, since film is such a visual medium anyway (leave explanations to writers, hehe). In the case of THE RING, we feel the horror, but we also feel a plot that strains to explain itself, and ends up merely being laughable instead (especially that final twist, which I had difficulty swallowing). If Kruger hadn't tried so hard, maybe this would have turned out to be a highly effective horror film instead one that made me wonder what the heck the horse in the middle of the film had to do with anything. I think THE RING is viscerally creepy enough that it earns its three stars here, but all of Verbinski's style cannot hide the fact that, plotwise, this film is a mess, and I certainly don't plan on seeing this film's intended sequel whenever it comes out.",3,"Viscerally creepy, but not a whole lot more than that",1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,1971,"['Gore', 'Verbinski', 'THE', 'RING', 'classic', 'example', 'film', 'style', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'Verbinski', 'certainly', 'how', 'make', 'creepy', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'laced', 'atmosphere', 'dread', 'gray', 'skies', 'Technically', 'quite', 'impressive', 'too', 'bad', 'skillful', 'visuals', 'are', 'put', 'service', 'really', 'dumb', 'plot', '-or', 'least', 'way', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'idea', 'videotape', 'killing', 'people', 'could', 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'film', '-but', 'when', 'screenplay', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'trying', 'explain', 'how', 'videotape', 'was', 'made', 'then', 'how', 'dilute', 'videotape', 'power', 'movie', 'just', 'became', 'plain', 'stupid', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'be', 'duped', 'blindly', 'accepting', 'kind', 'silliness', 'suppose', 'though', 'very', 'subjective', 'reaction', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'visuals', 'atmosphere', 'effective', 'enough', 'accept', 'film', 'second', 'thought', 'Still', 'remember', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'HALLOWEEN', 'never', 'really', 'provided', 'explanation', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'motives', 'course', 'quot', 'crazy', 'quot', 'think', 'perhaps', 'horror', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'burdened', 'having', 'explain', 'horror', '-it', 'should', 'merely', 'be', 'felt', 'film', 'visual', 'medium', 'anyway', 'leave', 'explanations', 'writers', 'hehe', 'case', 'THE', 'RING', 'feel', 'horror', 'also', 'feel', 'plot', 'explain', 'up', 'merely', 'being', 'laughable', 'instead', 'especially', 'final', 'twist', 'had', 'difficulty', 'swallowing', 'Kruger', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'highly', 'effective', 'horror', 'film', 'instead', 'one', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'heck', 'horse', 'middle', 'film', 'had', 'do', 'anything', 'think', 'RING', 'viscerally', 'creepy', 'enough', 'three', 'stars', 'here', 'Verbinski', 'style', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'fact', 'plotwise', 'film', 'mess', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'seeing', 'film', 'intended', 'sequel', 'whenever', 'out']",N/A

Good thing I haven't, because I hate this movie now. I notice that alot of people say this is scary, but it's not. I found it pretty boring and pointless. The story is that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. What a dumb idea. How was the tape made? Why was it made? Why would a ghost be using a tape to kill people for no apparent reason? Suddenly, the ghost becomes evil at the end and kills the main character's boyfriend. Then the main character decides to make more copies of the tape! Why? The acting wasn't bad, but that doesn't help really. I recommmend these movies: John Carpentar's The Thing, They Live, The Fog, In The Mouth of Madness, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser. Those are really great horror/science fiction movies.

606544,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B00005JLTK,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[1, 2]","When I saw ""The Ring"" at my local theater last fall was impressed enough by its wonderfully creeped-out vibe that I made it a point to pick it up on DVD when it the stores.  Having watched it last night though I felt a bit disappointed.Yes, the film still holds its impact on the small screen.  In fact, given its storyline it's arguably better watched on a TV than in a theater.  But my complaint with ""The Ring"" DVD is that it feels like it was thrown together quickly to get it in stores early while it's still ""hot"" from its recent theatrical run.Certainly it wouldn't be the first time. ""Dogma,"" ""X Men,"" ""Memento,"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" are just a few movies that were released in relatively bare bones DVD formats that were later followed by deluxe Special Editions bursting at the seams with extras.  The challenge this obviously creates for fans when it happens is they then have to decide if they want to buy the same movie twice.Now maybe that won't happen here.  Perhaps the plan was always to make ""The Ring"" a lean DVD release in recognition of the fact that many discs are overloaded with their ""everything AND the kitchen sink"" set of extras.  Really, unless you're unemployed do you have the time to sit through your average ""2-disc set loaded with EIGHT hours of deleted scenes, featurettes, documentaries, storyboards, and trailers""? Probably not.However, given the price of the typical DVD, a healthy set of extras can make you feel like you got your money's worth, something you may not feel after buying this movie.This is a film that, for example, cries out for a ""Making of"" documentary, one that could have not only highlighted the production but also its roots in Japan.  ""The Ring"" is actually a pretty faithful remake of Hideo Nakata's 1998 thriller ""Ringu.""  That film was based on a novel by Koji Suzuki and its success abroad spawned not only one but two other films, the sequel ""Ringu 2"" and prequel ""Ringu 0.""But casual viewers won't find any of this out because no such documentary is present here.  While the DVD does include a trailer for ""Ringu,"" that's the only reference to the original source material.  As for the much ballyhooed original short film that was created by director Gore Verbinski, especially for this disc, it's just a compilation of footage of the film, deleted scenes, and imagery from the movie's ""cursed video.""Though the alleged intent is to ""reveal more electrifying secrets about the mystery"" of the film (which some moviegoers apparently found confusing), there's nothing here that careful viewers won't have already ascertained from having watched the film the first time.And that's it for your extras.  No director's or actors' commentaries, no shooting script, no storyboards, nothing else.Ultimately, this DVD is worth buying for fans of the movie.  Its hauntingly beautiful cinematography practically cries out for the pristine picture quality that DVDs provide.Still some cost-conscious fans may wait until ""The Ring"" 2-disc Special Edition ""loaded with EIGHT hours deleted scenes, featurettes, documentaries, storyboards, and trailers"" hits store shelves.

Howlett,"[0, 3]","I have never really liked horror movies much, and so I sat here at the computer, wonderered if I should give a review to this movie, fearful that I might have been intrinsically biased to give it a bad review.  Well, after setting my qualms about horror aside, I'm giving it a bad review anyway.I knew this movie was going to be a bad one from the first snippets of dialogue: two teenage girls talking about Your Most Basic Outcast Teenager Stuff, and then the small talk is eschewed in the clunkiest manner possible when one suddenly tells the other about a videotape that kills the viewer one week after he/she watches it.  Ugh.  And uh-oh, one of the girls watched it seven days ago.  She dies, and her friend ends up in an psychiatric ward.Enter the heroine, an investigative reporter for a Seattle newspaper, played by Naomi Watts.  She's the aunt of the opening scene's victim.  She comes across the tape and watches it, and learns that she has seven days left.This part was actually intriguing to me, because I thought the movie was going to break free of the horror movie cliches it was in danger of getting bogged down into.  At this point it's more of a thriller; a race against time.  Title cards coveniently fade in, reminding us how long she has before she dies.  To add to the excitment, her son watches the tape--now she's not just fighting for her own life but his, too.The biggest problem with the movie was that it almost seemed to want to be another &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; by providing a twist and then giving a back story after the fact saying &quot;See, here's why there's a twist and why the movie doesn't end the way you think it does.&quot;  There is even a review on the box of the DVD stating that it is the best scary movie since &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.  Nice try, but this movie isn't a tenth of what that one is.The twist itself wasn't the problem--in fact, I kind of liked it and thought that after it was established that yes, this was the way things were REALLY going to work out, the movie would have ended on a stronger note without any explanation.  Instead, as before mentioned, more scenes take place that might interest some people who like all their stories tied up with a bow, but just left me thinking &quot;This movie's STILL not over?&quot;",1,Reaches for the stars but falls short,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,2289,"['have', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'horror', 'movies', 'much', 'so', 'sat', 'here', 'computer', 'wonderered', 'should', 'give', 'review', 'movie', 'fearful', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intrinsically', 'biased', 'give', 'bad', 'review', 'Well', 'setting', 'qualms', 'horror', 'aside', ""'m"", 'giving', 'bad', 'review', 'anyway.I', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'one', 'first', 'snippets', 'dialogue', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'talking', 'Your', 'Most', 'Basic', 'Outcast', 'Teenager', 'Stuff', 'then', 'small', 'talk', 'eschewed', 'clunkiest', 'manner', 'possible', 'when', 'one', 'suddenly', 'other', 'videotape', 'viewer', 'one', 'week', 'he/she', 'Ugh', 'uh-oh', 'one', 'girls', 'watched', 'seven', 'days', 'ago', 'friend', 'up', 'psychiatric', 'ward.Enter', 'heroine', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Seattle', 'newspaper', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'aunt', 'opening', 'scene', 'victim', 'tape', 'watches', 'seven', 'days', 'left.This', 'part', 'was', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'break', 'free', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'was', 'danger', 'getting', 'bogged', 'down', 'point', 'more', 'thriller', 'race', 'time', 'Title', 'cards', 'coveniently', 'fade', 'reminding', 'how', 'long', 'add', 'excitment', 'son', 'tape', 'now', 'not', 'just', 'fighting', 'own', 'life', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'seemed', 'want', 'be', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'providing', 'twist', 'then', 'giving', 'back', 'story', 'fact', 'saying', 'quot', 'See', 'here', 'why', 'twist', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'think', 'quot', 'even', 'review', 'box', 'DVD', 'stating', 'best', 'scary', 'movie', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'Nice', 'try', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tenth', 'what', 'one', 'is.The', 'twist', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'fact', 'kind', 'liked', 'thought', 'was', 'established', 'yes', 'was', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'REALLY', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'stronger', 'note', 'explanation', 'Instead', 'before', 'mentioned', 'more', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'might', 'interest', 'people', 'who', 'stories', 'tied', 'up', 'bow', 'just', 'left', 'thinking', 'quot', 'movie', 'STILL', 'not', 'quot']",N/A

Cute, funny and bursting with health teen Katie tells a friend about a weird tape she watched. According to legend after viewing this hellish tape you only have 7 days to live. Katie and her friend laugh it off and then in a terrifying scene Katie dies. Enter, Naomi Watts as Katie's aunt Rachel. Rachel is smart, attractive and a lousy mother. Oh she loves her son Aidan but it's clear that she has no idea what's going on his head or what he needs. She seems to be constantly forgetting about him or dumping him with sitters, teachers, and her sister. Rachel decides to investigates her neice's death and views the tape. Later she lets Noah, her ex boyfriend and Aidan's equally lousy father to veiw it. Finally little Aidan sees the tape and Rachel must race against time to save her family.She discovers the Morgans a once happy couple who adopted a baby girl named Samara. Like Rachel and Noah the Morgans clearly have no understanding at first, of whats going on in their child's head which turns out to be very bad for them.There are three perfect scenes in this movie. The first is when the Morgans' doctor, played by Jane Alexander tells Rachel point blank that life is better for everybody in the whole town now that Samara is gone. The second is when Rachel discovers what's in the well and the last is when Noah finds out what happens at the end of the 7 days.The Ring is a chilling movie and it will make you look twice at your TV set. Naomi Watts does a fine job. BUT there are some small flaws: Once Rachel is convinced about the danger of the tape why does she leave it out for her child to find? Aidan appears to be psychic. Has he always been gifted or is it Samara's doing? Aidan is supernaturally pale and has dark circles under his eyes. Rachel never seems to notice this. The ending was too weak. Rachel realizes that she's blown it, in part because she thought Samara was simply a sad child like Aidan and  decides to do a horrible thing in order to save him.

The plot is fresh and original and has never been done before with the exception of the original Japanese film Ringu that inspired this American version, which is far creepier and scarier than the Japanese version. However, it at first appears there are many unanswered questions at the end of the movie even after the mystery has been solved, leaving the audience to dissect and attempt to answer the questions. This is one of the things that makes it so good; it keeps you thinking about it long after it's over and eventually you end up answering your own questions.

It's the hallmark of the Japanese horror movie, ""Ringu,"" originally directed by Hideo Nakata, remade as ""The Ring"" for English-speaking viewers and directed by Gore Verbinski of ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Yes, there are pitiable elements to Samora's story, but in the end, she is a very bad little girl.Japanese horror plays by its own rules as evidenced by ""The Ring,"" the first of its kind. It has a staunch fan base while its commercial success spawned American remakes of ""Ju-on"" (""The Grudge,"" 2004), ""Pulse"" (""Pulse"" 2006), and ""Dark Water"" (""Dark Water"" 2006), along with some sequels. These aren't slasher flicks; they're unsettling in the best scary movie tradition: story and creatures stick with you, especially after you turn the lights out. ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" continue to be the best of the bunch.So what's it all about? Young single-mother and journalist Rachel, played by Naomi Watts in her breakthrough role, investigates a strange video tape. After experiencing a week's worth of escalating terror, viewers die after watching the film. Rachel's child, Aidan (David Dorfman), and the boy's father, photo-journalist Noah (Martin Henderson), are quickly drawn into the Ring's trap and it's up to Rachel to break through old secrets, piecing truth together out of macabre fantasies, in order to save them - and herself.Well noted for its outstanding, spooky imagery and Rick Baker's masterful effects, ""The Ring"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray. Images are sharp and well defined; skin tones washed in shades of blue and green, look real - and, yes, disturbing. The lossless surround soundtrack is a beaut as well. Rain comes down all around you; phones ring off to the side; sound effects and dialogue come through clearly against an original score by Hans Zimmer. This is a First Class show all the way.Bonus features entertain and enlighten and are carried over from previous releases. They are: ""Don't Watch This,"" the complete Ring video; ""Rings,"" a nifty after-movie video; cast and filmmaker interviews; and ""The Origin of Terror,"" exploring urban legends.",5,Who's the scariest of them all?

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[1, 2]","For some time now I've heard several great reports about this particular film and despite the fact that I don't often watch horror flicks, the overly positive reviews and touting up of this film overweighed my reticence.  The first thing I noticed was the PG-13 rating just before the film starts which immediately tells you that this isn't going to be a blood, guts and gore fest!  The second thing one will notice throughout the film is that it's not so much a horror flick as it is a pleasantly surprising, thrilling and suspenseful suspense/thriller.Of surprise as well are the relative newcomers who star in this film, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson.  Needless to say, I'm sure their stock has gone up considerably due to the success of this film.  Director Gore Verbinski deserves copious accolades for bringing this great film to the silver screen and the home theater!  From the camera angles to the shocking soundtrack, this film hits on all cylinders.The premise:The basic premise is pretty simple; some teenagers get away for the weekend at a remote cabin and find that the television reception is pretty poor but they do find a VHS tape in their room.  They've seemingly heard of this tape before but ignore the warnings/rumors about it, those warnings being that whenever someone watches it, they receive a phone call immediately afterwards telling them they have seven days and then exactly seven days later they turn up dead by various but almost inexplicable means.One of those teenagers that ends up dead at the beginning of the movie has an aunt who also happens to be a reporter, in comes the ""oh so"" gorgeous Naomi Watts as Aunt Rachel.  Rachel's sister entreats her into finding out what happened to her daughter and she takes on the task!  Rachel soon discovers where the children were and of course, she watches the tape and receives the phone call.  She now has seven days to figure out the mystery to save herself...What follows from there is as stated above, one of the best and most intriguing suspense/thrillers of 2002!  I highly recommend this movie as I'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised as well!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:This one is kind of short on the special features but who cares, because this is all about the film.Don't Watch This - Director Gore Verbinski created this short film exclusively for the video release that reveals more secrets about &quot;The Ring.&quot;  This short film in some ways raises some additional questions about the story and in others answers some of the questions one might've already had at the end of the film.A Trailer for Ringu which is the Japanese film that inspired &quot;The Ring.&quot;",5,The Ring - Surprisingly thrilling!,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",2003,2674,"['time', 'now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'several', 'great', 'reports', 'particular', 'film', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'watch', 'horror', 'flicks', 'overly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'touting', 'up', 'film', 'overweighed', 'reticence', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'just', 'film', 'immediately', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'fest', 'second', 'thing', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'horror', 'flick', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'suspense/thriller.Of', 'surprise', 'well', 'are', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'who', 'star', 'film', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'sure', 'stock', 'gone', 'up', 'considerably', 'due', 'success', 'film', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'copious', 'accolades', 'bringing', 'great', 'film', 'silver', 'screen', 'home', 'theater', 'camera', 'shocking', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'cylinders.The', 'premise', 'basic', 'premise', 'pretty', 'simple', 'teenagers', 'get', 'away', 'weekend', 'remote', 'cabin', 'find', 'television', 'reception', 'pretty', 'poor', 'do', 'find', 'VHS', 'tape', 'room', ""'ve"", 'seemingly', 'heard', 'tape', 'ignore', 'warnings/rumors', 'warnings', 'being', 'whenever', 'someone', 'receive', 'phone', 'call', 'immediately', 'telling', 'have', 'seven', 'days', 'then', 'exactly', 'seven', 'days', 'later', 'turn', 'up', 'dead', 'various', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'means.One', 'teenagers', 'up', 'dead', 'beginning', 'movie', 'aunt', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'reporter', 'oh', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Aunt', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'sister', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'daughter', 'task', 'Rachel', 'soon', 'where', 'children', 'were', 'course', 'tape', 'phone', 'call', 'now', 'seven', 'days', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'save', 'What', 'stated', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'intriguing', 'suspense/thrillers', '2002', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'as', 'well', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'one', 'kind', 'short', 'special', 'features', 'who', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'Watch', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'created', 'short', 'film', 'exclusively', 'video', 'release', 'more', 'secrets', 'quot', 'Ring.', 'quot', 'short', 'film', 'ways', 'additional', 'questions', 'story', 'others', 'answers', 'questions', 'one', 'might', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'end', 'film.A', 'Trailer', 'Ringu', 'Japanese', 'film', 'inspired', 'quot', 'Ring.', 'quot']",N/A

This relatively gore-free film is that special something everyone should own on a DVD or a video. It is a combination of suspense and thriller. The gore is practically non-existent. Yet, the fear factor climbs up high on the scale. Never ever could I imagine being scared of a little girl more than a house full of monsters- up until I saw The Ring. The evil in the little girl is so intense, so radiating that it makes me shudder just thinking about her. In this fantastic masterpiece, there are many ""jump"" scenes. The music is so eerie it makes you sit in your seat and widen your eyes with shock and with suspense of what the next moment might bring. The Ring is as unpredictable as you can get - you never know what will happen next, you have no clue on how the film will end.The fatal videocasette alone is a masterpiece. With almost no gore, it contains disturbing images playing in your mind afterwards - maggotts crawling out of peoples mouths, dead horses, a woman in a mirror combing her hair, a ladder leading god knows where. I remember the creeps it was giving me when I saw it in the theatres.The acting is excellent. The cast consists of some known actors, however, most of them are relatively unknown.

As I wasn't able to get my hands on a Japanese version(Which I saw later) and was highly anticipating seeing this after hearing great things about the Japanese one.In this version they use elements from both the first and second Ring movies from Japan. And add some new things and what-not. However I am on the side that enjoy the American version more. I think the Japanese one is more admirable, where this one seems more human and relatable.Sure it has its flaws, as does everything. But it scared the hell(BTW I normally don't say the &quot;h&quot; word) out of me, both times I saw it and just as much each time. I was frightened for weeks after seeing it each time. Though keep in mind I have a highly over-active imagination as well. And everyone is effected differently by things, so this may seem like the dumbest movie ever to you. Like both my mother and brother thought it was prety dumb. But me and my other brother were scared like hey!And BTW I've seen loads of horror movies(Been obsessed with them since age 3). But I thought this was probably one of the best to come out of the Hollywood machine in years(Then again since most of their movies suck, how much is that really saying.). But seriously for me it was absolutely frightening. I'll never think of a Tv set the same again.I don't know if I'll ever dare watching this alone, maybe I will just to see if I can get over my fears, or just to see if I can scare myself silly again. But as much as I love this movie I don't exactly want to be afraid all the time at night again. :( Or cover the tv in my room with a towel.I think what really makes this movie though is the atmosphere and music. It is a very creepy, harrowing, and eery mood. And has a feeling of impending doom. Plus the acting is good. I think that Gore Verbinski handled this movie very well. In less competent hands it would have been a mess. :)So watch it. It may effect you and then again it may not. The thing is to come in with an open mind and watch it alone in a dark room in the late-late night. And see if it effects you then. :pGod Bless ~Amy",5,Hmmmmm,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2191,"['guess', 'put', 'off', 'reviewing', 'nearly', 'year', 'now', 'saw', 'first', 'day', 'was', 'theaters', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'hands', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Which', 'saw', 'later', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipating', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'great', 'things', 'Japanese', 'one.In', 'version', 'use', 'elements', 'first', 'second', 'Ring', 'movies', 'Japan', 'add', 'new', 'things', 'what-not', 'However', 'am', 'side', 'American', 'version', 'more', 'think', 'Japanese', 'one', 'more', 'admirable', 'where', 'one', 'more', 'human', 'relatable.Sure', 'flaws', 'everything', 'scared', 'hell', 'BTW', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'quot', 'quot', 'word', 'times', 'saw', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'frightened', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'time', 'keep', 'mind', 'have', 'highly', 'over-active', 'imagination', 'well', 'everyone', 'effected', 'differently', 'things', 'may', 'seem', 'dumbest', 'movie', 'ever', 'mother', 'brother', 'thought', 'was', 'prety', 'dumb', 'other', 'brother', 'were', 'scared', 'hey', 'BTW', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loads', 'horror', 'movies', 'Been', 'obsessed', 'age', '3', 'thought', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'years', 'Then', 'again', 'most', 'movies', 'suck', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'saying.', 'seriously', 'was', 'absolutely', 'frightening', ""'ll"", 'never', 'think', 'Tv', 'set', 'same', 'again.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'dare', 'watching', 'alone', 'maybe', 'will', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'fears', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'scare', 'silly', 'again', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'want', 'be', 'afraid', 'time', 'night', 'again', 'cover', 'tv', 'room', 'towel.I', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'though', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'very', 'creepy', 'harrowing', 'eery', 'mood', 'feeling', 'impending', 'doom', 'acting', 'good', 'think', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'handled', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'competent', 'hands', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mess', 'So', 'watch', 'may', 'effect', 'then', 'again', 'may', 'not', 'thing', 'come', 'open', 'mind', 'watch', 'alone', 'dark', 'room', 'late-late', 'night', 'see', 'effects', 'then', 'pGod', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

The problem is you have to really let go of logic and sensibilities to thoroughly enjoy it.  I would have been happier if it had ended ten minutes before the ending, because the shock you were SUPPOSED to feel at the end wasn't worth the disbelief and ""hokiness"" of the final ten minutes.  A movie that could have been somewhat intellectually satisfying became a run of the mill teenage thriller and left my intellect feeling debased and deflated.  The original Japanese film 'Ringu' wasn't any better, and I usually always prefer an original foreign piece to its American copy.If you want to share a thriller of a movie with your kids (my boys are 9 and 12), this is the one to see.  No gratuitous sex scenes, no extraordinary amount of bad language, and the horror of it is much more psychological than visually graphic, except for one suicide scene which flashes quite quickly.  I won't let my kids see Jason or Freddy yet, but 'The Ring' scared the crap out of them without any permanent damage to their young psyches.  They actually placed a book of children's bible stories (I wouldn't let them use the family Bible) in front of their bedroom door that night - - but it was ""giggly-scared"", not sheer terror.  Of course, you have to know your own children well - your nine year old may not be able to handle it.  Our kids have grown up with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Army of Darkness', and other such scariness.  We try to protect our kids from graphic sexual depictions and realistic violent images.  To us, slaying a demon is not the same as watching a violent murder.If you are really looking for a good, quality chiller of a story, with fewer plot holes, I would suggest 'Stir of Echoes', 'What Lies Beneath', or 'The Others' instead of 'The Ring'.",4,I've seen better...,1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,1872,"[""'The"", 'Ring', 'certainly', 'effective', 'setting', 'chilling', 'mood', 'especially', 'watch', 'lights', 'out', 'problem', 'have', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'logic', 'sensibilities', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'had', 'ended', 'ten', 'minutes', 'ending', 'shock', 'were', 'SUPPOSED', 'feel', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'disbelief', 'hokiness', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'intellectually', 'satisfying', 'became', 'run', 'mill', 'teenage', 'thriller', 'left', 'intellect', 'feeling', 'debased', 'deflated', 'original', 'Japanese', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'usually', 'always', 'prefer', 'original', 'foreign', 'piece', 'American', 'copy.If', 'want', 'share', 'thriller', 'movie', 'kids', 'boys', 'are', '9', '12', 'one', 'see', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'extraordinary', 'amount', 'bad', 'language', 'horror', 'much', 'more', 'psychological', 'visually', 'graphic', 'one', 'suicide', 'scene', 'quite', 'quickly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'see', 'Jason', 'Freddy', 'yet', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'scared', 'crap', 'permanent', 'damage', 'young', 'psyches', 'actually', 'placed', 'book', 'children', 'bible', 'stories', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'use', 'family', 'Bible', 'front', 'bedroom', 'door', 'night', 'was', 'giggly-scared', 'not', 'sheer', 'terror', 'course', 'have', 'know', 'own', 'children', 'well', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'kids', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', ""'Army"", 'Darkness', 'other', 'such', 'scariness', 'try', 'protect', 'kids', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'depictions', 'realistic', 'violent', 'images', 'slaying', 'demon', 'not', 'same', 'watching', 'violent', 'murder.If', 'are', 'really', 'looking', 'good', 'quality', 'chiller', 'story', 'fewer', 'plot', 'holes', 'would', 'suggest', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', ""'What"", 'Beneath', 'Others', 'instead', ""'The"", 'Ring']",N/A

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible. ""The Ring"" gives you all this and more.This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know, that likely exists in our own home. We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked. The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend. Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique. Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, ""seven days."" Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane. Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge. Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape. The phone rings, and the fear begins.Soon joining Rachel are her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son. Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying. We discover, with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together, that every image in the movie has meaning.The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself. As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen and the best I've seen recently. Elements of the movie are similar to ""Fear Dot Com,"" which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as ""The Ring."" I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout.

It's actually a mystery wrapped in a horror/thriller film, and there's even a brief film within the film which is a big part of the plot, and is actually one of the scariest and creepiest things in the whole movie, and whose haunting, creepy, and disturbing images will stay with you for a long time.I watched this movie without knowing much about it, so I didn't have much in the way of expectations, but after the first few minutes I was hooked and watched the whole thing, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm usually not much of a fan of the horror/thriller movie genre, because all too often they try to frighten you with a lot of gratuitous violence and gore that really isn't relevant to the movie. Although this movie has it's share of violent and gory scenes, it's much more of a psychological thriller than another cheap Hollywood gorefest, and the movie's dark and disturbing images and even the dreary and overcast Seattle and Puget Sound weather maintain an appropriately dark and creepy mood until the very end.My only problem, as I said, is with a number of plot and story elements that don't make much sense, such as why the horse on the ferry became disturbed and jumped overboard when the woman lead character walked up to the horse trailer, how the video recording codes could be removed from the mysterious video tape that the people are watching, how the phone caller knows when you've watched the movie to call you, why the old farmer on Puget Sound committed suicide 20 or years after the little girl was murdered when the woman reporter came snooping around, what's causing the reporter's son to make the strange drawings that seem to relate to the murder of many years ago, why nobody was supposed to help the little girl, and even why the mother, who was said to have wanted the child more than anything in the world, murdered her daughter, and so on.

Although Rachel has dug herself into a gigantic hole, she just can't put the shovel down and drags all sorts of people into it with her.

A suicide, a car accident, and a hideous, inexplicable heart attack.  One mother, distraught at the death of her daughter begs her sister Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a reporter, to investigate the mystery.  Rachel first stumbles over the tape, then her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) sees it when she goes to him for help, and finally her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) watches the tape.  Now they are in the midst of a race to discover the story behind the tape and avert their deaths.  A simple plot, built out of what is almost an urban legend.  But not a simple film by any means.This version of the story is based on the Japanese film Ringu, which in turn is based on Koji Suzuki's book.  In each form, the story depends not on scenes of great horror, but on a careful creation of atmosphere that gradually turns up the tension.  Visual horror is used only occasionally, but each director has carefully used the symbols introduced in the videotape throughout the story, until real and unreal completely overlap and the viewer sees portents everywhere.Director Gore Vorbinski is a bit more heavy handed about this, but he does it so well, and the cinematography is to visually gripping that I actually prefer his approach to the Japanese version, which requires more watching to break through the layers of subtlety, as well as some awareness of the matrix of Japanese legends that the story keys off of.  Instead Vorbinski updates the underlying story behind the curse and incredible use of a horse farm to give the story a more understandable context for the US viewer.The acting is understated, almost minimalist, making the characters almost part of the ambience of the film, rather than acting in the center of a stage.  Emotion is there when it is called for, though, but one of the most stellar bits of acting is done by Dorfman as Aidan Keller, who manages to the most unnerving character of the plot.  Having seen both the Japanese and US films, I can honestly say that both are worth seeing.

606580,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JLTK,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[4, 4]","There was a time when horror films were fun, scary, and exciting. Lately, they have lost their edge, becoming nothing more than horrendous parodies of themselves-- greenlit by money-hungry producers looking to make a quick buck. Horror films used to cause excitement amongst moviegoers. Now, whenever a horror flick is released, it quickly gets lost in the crowd of comedies and quasi star-vehicles. Frequently ignored at the mainstream box-office but made so cheaply, these films more often than not make a profit, inspiring countless unnecessary sequels, keeping those suited tyrants smiling all the way to the bank.Just in time for Halloween, a handful of horror films were released. Amongst them was ""The Ring,"" an American remake of a 1998 Japanese hit, adapted by ""Arlington Road"" and ""Scream 3"" scribe Ehren Kruger. Here is a fine example of a modern horror film that actually thrills, and proof that strong word of mouth can greatly benefit a good film not expected to do as well. Not only is this one of the best horror films ever made, it is also one of the few remakes that actually fare better than the original.""The Ring"" is a surprisingly effective and subtle horror film that, through genuine wit and intelligence, stands out amongst the computer-generated messes that pass for Hollywood's current attempt at horror. It's a surprisingly dark film that stands in nihilistic contrast to the feel-good, life-affirming style of horror typified by The Sixth Sense and its many imitations.""The Ring"" sets up its central premise with admirable speed and clarity. Supposedly, there's an urban legend about a mysterious, unmarked video tape that somehow causes the death, seven days later, of anyone unlucky enough to watch it. One unfortunate viewer is the niece of neurotic reporter and single mother Naomi Watts. While investigating her niece's death, Watts has the misfortune of watching the tape herself. The premise is beautifully set up in a simple opening scene that uses a ringing telephone and the image of a static-filled TV screen, as well as a pulse-pounding musical score, to whip up a sudden crescendo of tension.Director Gore Verbinski's (The Mexican) visualization of what is on that tape has to be counted as one of the film's major triumphs. He is to be commended for not taking the easy route of filling the screen with explicit but meaningless ""shock"" images: instead, he creates a creepy collage of surreal but recognizable pictures. They have the disturbing power to get under the viewer's skin with such skill that it creates a feeling of continually growing dread which doesn't become obvious until it's already too late to escape.Having watched the tape, Watts soon receives a phone call informing her that she (and apparently, the film's audience) now has precisely seven days left to live. Refreshingly, Watts goes against American horror film convention by neither ignoring the threat or attempting to escape in the stupidest, most illogical way possible. Instead, she immediately sets about to figure out what the tape means and how she can prevent her own seemingly inevitable demise. Aiding her in this endeavor are her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her disconcertingly Haley Joel Osmentish son (wonderfully played by David Dorfman in a very creepy performance).This is the rare Hollywood horror film that actually respects its audience's intelligence enough not to have its heroine freaked out by finding a stray cat wandering around the pantry. Instead, Verbinski gets his scares by filming an off-center vision of a world that is recognizably our own. He has the patience to create a subtle atmosphere that prays not on our immediate impulses, but on the usually hidden fears that lurk within us all--the knowledge that at any moment, our life could end for reasons we'll never know.In horror films, the less you know, the scarier things are. Verbinski understands that the camera creates tension just by moving; he builds anticipation and suspense about what could be lurking just outside the frame, while rarely revealing what it might be. The look of fear so clearly expressed by his characters is always more chilling than any monster he might turn his camera on. Perhaps Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is when the film's main horror finally does make itself visible after dominating the viewer's imagination, it still manages to be as frightening as anything we could have visualized in our mind's eye. Yes, I was absolutely terrified!Though this film is obviously designed to showcase the skills of its director, one cannot ignore how much of the film's success comes from Naomi Watts' performance as a very untypical horror heroine. Playing her role with an unstable neurotic streak, Watts manages to make her character endearing, frustrating and, most importantly, real. In a time when so many horror films tend to present women as either cute survivors or victims born only to be exploited and punished, Watts gives us a recognizable human being who, though understandably terrified, displays welcome strength and determination, giving the film a needed boost of reality.""The Ring"" is a handsomely mounted, intelligently crafted thriller that skillfully maintains a tense sense of dread. The crisp editing, fluid camera work, meticulous production design, menacing score and gloomy Pacific Northwest locations all contribute to the unsettling atmosphere, as does Verbinski's decision to use primal horror imagery, rather than gore and cheap scare tactics, to unnerve us.Verbinski and company have crafted an exemplary thriller, and maybe one of the year's best films. I have not seen a thriller as disturbing and satisfying since the likes of Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" or Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others.""  ""The Ring"" is a true masterpiece of modern horror, which is wonderful considering Hollywood hasn't pumped out any consistently good edge-of-your-seat films in quite some time. Maybe ""The Ring"" will help change this. One can only hope.",5,"A fun, scary, and chilling experience!!!",1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,6013,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'were', 'fun', 'scary', 'exciting', 'Lately', 'have',

The photography, dark and brooding, is outstanding. And the female talent - Amber Tamblyn, who turns green (and who eats it early), and Naomi Watts, who doesn't do either - are both delicious to watch.Amber and three of her buddies (including her boyfriend) catch a video - and they all die within a week, exactly. Naomi watches it too, as do her ex-husband and her son; so she's driven to solve the mystery before she croaks; which she does (solve it, that is), detective style, in bits.The acting in the film is first rate; and Naomi is entertaining to follow with her beautiful green eyes and overly luscious red lips (even though she doesn't kiss another girl, as she did most recently in Mulholland Drive).Without giving everything away, Naomi ties up all of the story's loose ends. (Each person sees a ring before they die, which is but a piece.) The movie, however, doesn't end when you think it does; but it finishes later - before you think it should. (Does that make sense?)Watching this feature reminded me of a Dean Koontz novel. The story is fairly linear, with just a touch of technology and science (medicine) mixed in for fright. The visuals are only mildly gruesome; and all of the fear is generated by acting and pacing, which makes the movie ultimately very satisfying.I'm not usually into horror flicks, but I enjoyed this film immensely.

But, when her aunt,the reporter, begin to look for evidence like Sherlock Holmes, I guessed it will end like DRAGONFLY or WHAT LIES BENEATH.But I was wrong when it show WHY THEY DIED. The figure of ""the creature"", suprisingly, is very very Asian banshee style. White clothes, long hair, black eyes and skinny. In my country, we call it KUNTILANAK (banshee/female ghost). No wonder almost ladies in cinema scccrrreeeeaaaaammmm...... because this figure is very familiar in far east, especially south east asia.Two thumbs up to this idea. I like it, better than other holywood horror. No blood, no killing process, no wierd creature like WISHMASTER, but you see people dead.Oh, one more thing, I like ""the video"" content.

606583,A3CHJZXSNR5GHO,B00005JLTK,Matt,"[2, 11]","Dear God,Please deliber me from ever seeing movies like ""The Rink"" again. Ok, pretend it's 1982. John Carpenter's mood masterpiece ""The Thing"" is released upon the movie going public. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror films ever released. What do the critics have to say? Well, they HATED it. The end leaves you without closure as to whether or not the Thing survived and may or may not take over the planet. What does this have to do with The Ring?...Well, the critics resounding LOVE for this [item], mainly.Not only does The Ring not have a definate ending, but aside from the first ten minutes of the film, it has no definate ANYTHING. The plot is a complete mess. It starts off sounding like a pretty great movie. There's a cursed tape, kills you within a week of watching it, and the first ten minutes takes this fantastic premise and uses it to scare the heck out of the viewer. I kept expecting to see more scenes like that, but instead the movie jumps back and forth between completely nonsensical and unrelated plots. There's something about an infertile mother and diseased horses...I mean, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I know that this movie never explains ANY of these stupid little subplots which fill the following hour and twenty and minutes.What do the critics have to say about this film? This film which has about twelve different plotlines and never explains what one has to do with the other? ""The best movie since The Exorcist!!!""? Jeezus...Maybe they mean Exorcist II: The Heretic, but The Exorcist I watched was a landmark movie which was actually scary and at the same time, made perfect sense. It also presented a great question about human psychology throughout the ages and about what we MIGHT be capable of with that 90% of our brains which we never use, or what evils we might be susceptible to. ""The Ring"" presents you with nothing. No questions except just what exactly the HELL you just paid seven dollars to sit through.I'm a horror fan. I've sat through some strange stuff over the years, and not all of it made perfect sense. Videodrome, for example. Not EVERYTHING in Videodrome makes perfect sense, but in it, you're seeing things through the eyes of a man who is slowly losing his grip on reality, and a reality which is slowly losing it's grip on the TV addicted human race. So even though not everything is explained, it doesn't need to be. It takes place in a world gone mad. Or Phantasm...You're seeing things in sort of a dream-state. The Ring gives the viewer no such luxuries to its driveling incoherent storyline. The simple fact is, whoever adapted it from ""Ringu"" for American audiences was just an idiot. He clearly believes that audiences won't know the difference between a plot that has a narrative, sequential story, and a movie like the Ring that has no plot. Apparently he was right.

606584,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLTK,Matthew Horner,"[2, 6]","""The Ring"" is one of the most successful horror movies of recent years and is sure to spawn a series of sequels. I have mixed feeling about it. It is meticulously crafted. The cinematography is some of the best I saw in 2002. It is nothing if not atmospheric.  The problem I have with it is that it seems to be all about technique. I don't find it particularly scary, although that may be because its premise doesn't arouse any of my personal phobias. And I think it's choppy script structure gives it an ambiguity which leads many viewers to think it has hidden meaning. It doesn't, as far as I can see.Rachel Keller [Naomi Watts] is a young reporter whose life is thrown into disarray after her teenaged niece dies mysteriously of a heart attack. Friends of the deceased tell her that the girl watched a bizarre videotape with three of her friends. They say that anyone who watched it does in seven days. When Rachel discovers that all four teens dies at the same time on the same day, she starts to investigate. She locates the tape, which she watches. Moments later the phone rings, and a voice tells her that she has a week left to live.  Soon, both her ex-boyfriend and her young son have seen it. Rachel begins a frantic search to find the tape's origin and to undo its curse.The movie's high visual style and competent acting were enough to make me find it fairly enjoyable. Towards the end, there is explanation after explanation, which I found tedious because, rather than leaving the viewer with tantalizing ambiguities, the movie insists on providing answers which are increasingly silly. It becomes complex for no valid reason, other than to show a triumph of style over substance. This isn't to say that the movie isn't fun, it's to say that that's all it is.",3,Stylish horror thriller is anything but profound,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,1773,"['Ring', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'horror', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'sure', 'spawn', 'series', 'sequels', 'have', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'cinematography', 'best', 'saw', '2002', 'nothing', 'not', 'atmospheric', 'problem', 'have', 'be', 'technique', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'scary', 'may', 'be', 'premise', ""n't"", 'arouse', 'personal', 'phobias', 'think', 'choppy', 'script', 'structure', 'ambiguity', 'many', 'viewers', 'think', 'hidden', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see.Rachel', 'Keller', '[', 'Naomi', 'Watts', ']', 'young', 'reporter', 'life', 'thrown', 'disarray', 'teenaged', 'niece', 'mysteriously', 'heart', 'attack', 'Friends', 'deceased', 'tell', 'girl', 'watched', 'bizarre', 'videotape', 'three', 'friends', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'seven', 'days', 'When', 'Rachel', 'four', 'teens', 'same', 'time', 'same', 'day', 'investigate', 'tape', 'Moments', 'later', 'phone', 'rings', 'voice', 'week', 'left', 'live', 'Soon', 'ex-boyfriend', 'young', 'son', 'have', 'seen', 'Rachel', 'frantic', 'search', 'find', 'tape', 'origin', 'undo', 'curse.The', 'movie', 'high', 'visual', 'style', 'competent', 'acting', 'were', 'enough', 'make', 'find', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'explanation', 'explanation', 'found', 'tedious', 'rather', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'tantalizing', 'ambiguities', 'movie', 'providing', 'answers', 'are', 'increasingly', 'silly', 'complex', 'valid', 'reason', 'other', 'show', 'triumph', 'style', 'substance', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fun', 'say']",N/A

Having said that, the rest of the movie undermines those images. The trouble is not with the acting, editing, cinematography, etc. The trouble is with the story itself. While the premise - evil child is born, threatens parents and horses and whatever else, is ""killed"" by parents, then returns from grave to kill again - is interesting, it is also highly unoriginal. The means by which the evil one kills is also not entirely original although the images used in telling the tale are quite effective. I think the problem here is that the storyline is so familiar that no amount of scary pictures and lighting will allow you to forget you are watching a rerun. Not only that, but the storyline is disconnected. How is Samara supposed to kill someone 7 days later if there is no television around? What is the purpose of the telephone call except to condition the audience to jump at the sound of a ringing phone? While answers to these questions may not be necessary in scaring the audience, they should have been explored more in telling the story. When the heroine realizes that it took 7 days for Samara to die, the explanation seemed gratuitous rather than important. Moreover, if she (Samara) ""never sleeps"" how could she be killed in the first place?

Fleischer,"[3, 3]","The Ring, DreamWorks' 2002 U.S. remake of Asmik ACE Entertainment's 1998 Japanese thriller, Ringu, based on author Koji Suzuki's bestselling novel, Ring ([1991], 2003), merits, without equivocation, its surprise-hit status.Airing her hatred of television to high school compatriot Becca Kottler (Rachael Bella), The Ring opens in Katie Embry's (Amber Tamblyn) protected, upscale suburban Seattle home. Mulling the neurological effects of electromagnetic transmissions, she accuses big business of conspiring to keep the public in the dark. Becca asks Katie if she knows anything about the mysterious videotape that has surfaced at rival Revere High, its harrowing images purportedly invoking the horrid deaths of unmindful viewers ""seven days"" after receiving an eerie phone call from a whispering, young girl. Katie admits she and her Revere boyfriend, Josh, and another young couple, saw the macabre recording in place of the football game they planned to watch during their recent rendezvous at nearby Shelter Mountain Inn. Fulfilling the urban myth, Katie clutches her throat, feigning suffocation, which unhinges Becca. Moments later, at 10 PM, Katie IS dead! Curled-up in her closet with mouth agape, putrid and soaking wet, she resembles the tormented soul in Edvard Munch's infamous masterpiece, The Scream.As a psychological thriller, The Ring plumbs the murky depths of psyches wracked by loss and broken relationships. Katie's untimely death devastates the Embry's and haunts their perceptive, six-year old-nephew, Aidan Keller (David Dorfman), who adored his older cousin. Unsatisfied with the official cause of death of heart failure, Ruth Embry (Lindsay Frost) asks her younger sister, Rachel (Naomi Watts), with whom Katie bonded, to investigate. Heading a single parent household after her separation from Noah Clay (Martin Henderson), Rachel Keller supports her son, Aidan, as a journalist with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. At Katie's wake, she discovers Josh died on the same night and time as Katie, apparently of suicide, allegedly jumping-off a high-rise building. At work, Rachel learns the pair's trysting cohorts perished on the same night and time, exactly one week after viewing the accursed videotape.Aidan's disturbed drawings of frocked, young girls buried underground, floating underwater, and entombed in rocket ships has alarmed his teacher (Sandra Thigpen) who informs Rachel of the matter after the latter arrives late from work to pick up her son at school. Rachel shrugs-off his teacher's concern, resolving Aidan's sketches depict his deceased cousin, Katie. Determining the illustrations predate Katie's death by several days, Aidan's teacher intimates he may be communicating something else. The innuendo infuriates Rachel, but raises her consciousness as well.At its core, The Ring revolves around the murder of a paranormally gifted child, Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase), a ghostly sprite in the Dickensian tradition, left for dead in a well, eternally doomed to a watery purgatory. Subjected to failed adoptions and heartless institutionalization, Samara is everyone's child whose life is tragically cut short, abandoned, abused, neglected, and denied of loving natural and adoptive parents--especially caring mothers. In death, Samara seeks to return in resonate surrogates, finding them in Aidan and his journalist mom. Samara has a story to tell. She voices it subconsciously in dreams and subliminally with nensha (thoughtography), enabling her to telepathically ""burn"" ethereal images of herself and her impressions into mind and media, such as videotape, and telekinetically manipulate matter. If Samara haunts those who, in complacency, blindly turn away from her, or callously trivialize her plight, then those who are unable or unwilling to fathom her videotape will, after a week, summon her corrupt Cabalistic twin, a virulent, festering, demon who effortlessly conjures death by encircling its victims in an otherworldly tsunami. Rachel, who is consumed with saving her son's life, as an unintended viewer of the videotape, more than her own life, or that of her estranged partner, Noah, whose support she sought as a media expert, emerges from Samara's philosopher's stone well as a sentient sentinel.Not since Alfred Hitchcock's inspirational adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's The Birds (1963) has a film so influentially ascribed the esoteric role of consciousness-raising to a spiritually enlightened, capable female lead character, separating it from dronish portrayals in more banal slasher-hacker features. Like Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), Rachel Keller is a harbinger of change, encountering, at best, reticence in an asylum confined Becca, and self-absorption in the Morgan's family physician, Dr. Grasnik (Jane Alexander), who is oblivious to Samara's fate. At worst, Rachel faces overt hostility in Samara's morose and physically abusive, adoptive father, Richard Morgan (Brian Cox). Thanks to producers, Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes, screenwriters, Hiroshi Takahashi and Ehren Kruger, and director, Gore Verbinski for advancing the Master's torch; to Hans Zimmer for his memorable, haunting score; and, finally, to Naomi Watts, who follows her breakthrough performance in Mulholland Drive in breathtaking fashion as a distraught mother and tenacious seeker of truth, making us believers.With each passing day, Samara broadcasts more powerful, revelatory hallucinations of significant persons, places, and events, such as her ill-fated, adoptive mother, Anna Morgan's mental decline, and failed horse breeding business and equestrian competitions, as well as enigmatic symbols such as falling ladders, spinning chairs, and severed, wriggling fingers--beckoning her victims ever-closer to her abysmal black hole, like a ticking time bomb.In the end, this potent, metaphysical cocktail of a film imbibes us with a morally perplexing, catch-22 twist: If faced with our own impending deaths, and that of our loved ones, including our children, and given only one chance to save everyone, would we take it? Rachel can do this by copying and proliferating Samara's wretched videotape. Doing so, however, condemns others to the same destiny. Altruistically, Rachel can sacrifice herself, Noah, and Aidan, ensuring the continuation of humanity. What if there are other videotapes in circulation unbeknownst to us?As a child authority and high school teacher, author Koji Suzuki characterizes young people with intelligence, insight, and self-reliance---near equivalents of their adult counterparts, which we should welcome. Concomitantly, he warns us that our children are fragile and vulnerable beings, which should disarm us.",5,''Listen to Your Children'',1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,6699,"['Ring', 'DreamWorks',

606593,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JLTK,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 5]","magine that you stumbled upon an old video tape. Placing it into the VCR, a large glowing ring appears on the screen in front of you. After that graphic and disturbing images begin to flash on the television screen culminating to a final scene of a black and white forest with a well in the middle. Then the screen turns fuzzy and the tape is finished. Sound like another college independent art film right? Well, let's say that your phone rings and the voice on the other end says you have seven days before you die. Just an urban legend, right? What if it came true? This is the idea from the Japanese horror film, Ringu, which was adapted for American audiences in the thriller, The Ring. But will the adaptation work for American audiences or will the creators of the film be the only ones that are scared?The story goes that Rachel Keller is investigating the death of a teenage girl whose cause of death was declared unknown. But she soon discovers that this story goes way beyond this teenage girl's death. Three other teenagers that were friends of hers also died on the same day at the exact same time as the teenage girl. Their deaths were also declared unknown. What is the connection between the four teenagers? About one week before their deaths, they traveled up to a remote cabin in the woods where they had stumbled upon a tape. Rachel comes upon the tape and watches it. The phone rings and the voice on the other end of the phone tells her she has seven days before she dies. She has seven days to discover the mystery of The Ring before time runs out. The Ring has one of the best stories out there. The plot goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is released around the fall season. Unfortunately the ending ruins almost all tension and mystery that is presented in the film.The cast does a stellar job of presenting believable characters and making the fear altogether more real. Naomi Watts is great in the role of Rachel Keller, the investigative reporter who searches for the answer to the mystery of The Ring. Her character is mainly the focus of the film, though not entirely, and she does a wonderful job of making her character both a wonderful mother figure as well as a strong hero. Martin Henderson plays Rachel's ex-husband who helps her discover the mystery of The Ring. Henderson does a good job though you don't really get to see too many scenes with just him outside of a scene near the end of the film. He is usually just playing of Naomi Watts or her character's son, played by David Dorfman. David Dorfman does a great job at giving a creepy feeling to the audience but also making the audiences feel sympathetic toward his character. His character, though, came off as a Sixth Sense rip-off in parts but not too much so. Daveigh Chase, who voiced the character of Lilo in Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch, is exceptionally creeping and disturbing as the character of Samara Morgan. Revealing what her character does would give away too much of the movie. But rest assured, she does a fabulous job in this important role.Overall, The Ring goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is dumped during the fall season. As good as it is, the film's ending does not do it justice because the ending is so ridiculously stupid that it ruins the effects presented earlier in the film. Not to say the rest of the film outside of the ending is not good. Gore Verbinski, whose next project is Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, does a great job of presenting the right amount of tension and excitement in parts of the film where it is needed. Unfortunately the ending ruins those effects by giving the audience an ending that makes them feel ripped off. There is no real logical way to explain the feeling without giving away most of the plot. There are also many parts of the mystery of the Ring that are left unsolved but they will reportedly be solved in either the prequel or sequel to the film which is expected to open in theaters in October 2004. If you do decided to watch The Ring, you are in for a real cinematic treat but don't have too high expectations as the ending will leave you disappointed.",3,The Moose Hole - 'Ring' of Disappointment,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,4164,"['magine', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'old', 'video', 'tape', 'Placing', 'VCR', 'large', 'glowing', 'ring', 'screen', 'front', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'images', 'begin', 'flash', 'television', 'screen', 'culminating', 'final', 'scene', 'black', 'white', 'forest', 'well', 'middle', 'Then', 'screen', 'fuzzy', 'tape', 'finished', 'Sound', 'college', 'independent', 'art', 'film', 'right', 'Well', 'let', 'say', 'phone', 'rings', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'have', 'seven', 'days', 'die', 'Just', 'urban', 'legend', 'right', 'What', 'came', 'true', 'idea', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'Ringu', 'was', 'adapted', 'American', 'audiences', 'thriller', 'Ring', 'will', 'adaptation', 'work', 'American', 'audiences', 'will', 'creators', 'film', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'are', 'scared', 'story', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'investigating', 'death', 'teenage', 'girl', 'cause', 'death', 'was', 'declared', 'unknown', 'soon', 'story', 'way', 'teenage', 'girl', 'death', 'Three', 'other', 'teenagers', 'were', 'friends', 'hers', 'also', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'teenage', 'girl', 'deaths', 'were', 'also', 'declared', 'unknown', 'What', 'connection', 'four', 'teenagers', 'one', 'week', 'deaths', 'traveled', 'up', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'where', 'had', 'stumbled', 'tape', 'Rachel', 'tape', 'watches', 'phone', 'rings', 'voice', 'other', 'end', 'phone', 'seven', 'days', 'seven', 'days', 'discover', 'mystery', 'Ring', 'time', 'out', 'Ring', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'out', 'there', 'plot', 'way', 'usual', 'horror', 'fare', 'released', 'fall', 'season', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'ruins', 'almost', 'tension', 'mystery', 'presented', 'film.The', 'cast', 'stellar', 'job', 'presenting', 'believable', 'characters', 'making', 'fear', 'altogether', 'more', 'real', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'great', 'role', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'who', 'answer', 'mystery', 'Ring', 'character', 'mainly', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'character', 'wonderful', 'mother', 'figure', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'hero', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'Rachel', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'discover', 'mystery', 'Ring', 'Henderson', 'good', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'usually', 'just', 'playing', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'character', 'son', 'played', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'audience', 'also', 'making', 'audiences', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'character', 'though', 'came', 'off', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'rip-off', 'parts', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'who', 'voiced', 'character', 'Lilo', 'Disney', 'Lilo', 'amp', 'Stitch', 'exceptionally', 'creeping', 'disturbing', 'character', 'Samara', 'Morgan', 'Revealing', 'what', 'character', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'rest', 'assured', 'fabulous', 'job', 'important', 'role.Overall', 'Ring', 'way', 'usual', 'horror', 'fare', 'dumped', 'fall', 'season', 'As', 'good', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'ending', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', 'effects', 'presented', 'earlier', 'film', 'Not', 'say', 'rest', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'good', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'next', 'project', 'Disney', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'right', 'amount', 'tension', 'excitement', 'parts', 'film', 'where', 'needed', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'ruins', 'effects', 'giving', 'audience', 'ending', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'real', 'logical', 'way', 'explain', 'feeling', 'giving', 'away', 'most', 'plot', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'parts', 'mystery', 'Ring', 'are', 'left', 'unsolved', 'will', 'reportedly', 'be', 'solved', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'film', 'expected', 'open', 'theaters', 'October', '2004', 'do', 'decided', 'watch', 'Ring', 'are', 'real', 'cinematic', 'treat', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'high', 'expectations', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'disappointed']",N/A

Every year or so theres only one scary film out there. One film, that is above and beyond all the rest and is considered the greatest film of our time. The Sixth Sense was the last one, The Ring is the new scary film on the block.The Ring is a movie about a young newsreporter with one child and she is divorced. After her niece is killed by supposodley a video, she tracks down the mker of the video to find out why her niece died and to pull a big story for her newspaper article. What she doesn't know is that the video is controlled by a little girl who just wants people to spread te word about her life and how she was wronged. Personally I thought it was a heck of a story. The detail the amazing acting by Naomi Watts, was absolutley stunning. The one thing about the movie is that it uses a diffrent aspect of scariness, which is not blood or gore but is the story. This is something almost all scary movies have forgotten, a good story. Most scary movies just pull alot of blood and gore out and they think that the movie will be scary. The Ring uses almost no blood or gore and in my mind is the best scary movie since the sixth sense.The one bad thing about the movie will be that it will seem confusing to the unbright people. If you pay attention though the movie will be easy to understand but you might have to see it again before you fully understand what actually happened. ONe reall good thing about the movie though is that it will play with your mind and make anyone believe that you are actually in the story. The director really tries to put you in the story. It makes you want to believe that any second from now your television set will turn on and be all staticy. And then Samara will show you the ring and WHAP your dead. The movie played with my head alot. I was so scared after seeing this movie in the theatres. In fact I didnt sleep that night or the next night after.All in all, watch the ring, don't rent it watch it. But dont watch it alone hehehe.

606595,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00005JLTK,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","The Ring is an American adaptation of a Japanese horror film.  There are of course purists who think that the original Japanese movie is far better and this one should not have even been made.  If you have never seen the Japanese film and have no prior frame of reference, then that fact is not going to bother you.It starts out with an almost urban legend kind of feel.  We learn in the very beginning that there is a VHS tape out there that, if you watch it, you receive a phone call with a cryptic message ""7 days"", and exactly 7 days later the viewer dies.  The main character's (Rachel played by Naomi Watts) niece dies at the beginning of the movie, and Rachel begins investigating her death.  In the process watches the tape, and it then becomes a race against time to save herself, her ex husband and her son.The movie is much more psychological thriller than slasher.  There is very little in the way of gore to the movie, it is all surprise and suspense.  Most of the movie is trying to figure out the back story of the images that play out on the tape and piece together what happened.  It is not really a movie that you can have on in the background and get what is going on.  You do have to pay pretty close attention to what is going on after it gets going.  So if you are not into those kinds of movies, you will probably not like this one.I am not sure that the version of the DVD I have even exists anymore, so I am not sure that the extras on my version (which do not amount to much, just a short featurette that functions as almost a compilation of deleted scenes that fill in some of the gaps of the story) and trailers for other movies apply to what is out there now.  Since you can stream it online I am not sure if it is a must own on DVD or blu ray but if you like extras you may want to do some investigating about what is out there on the various versions.Like is the case with any movies, whether you like this or not is totally subjective.  It is definitely a smarter horror movie, in the sense that you can even call it a horror movie.

Such techniques are both atmospherically and hauntingly intentional. Thanks, Gore.The symbolism used in 'The Ring' is out of this world, latching to a masterfully constructed plot, although Verbinski was not the original creator of the story, neither were the producers of the Chinese film. Actually, Ringu is based on a Chinese novel. So 'The RING' is a remake--so what?

606600,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JLTK,Mitch Weaver,"[0, 3]","&quot;The Ring&quot; focuses on a woman named Rachel ( Naomi Watts). She is a successful jouranlist that is investigating the death of her teenage niece. According to her niece's friends, it was due to a teenage urban myth. The myth states that there is a video that kills you after you watch it due to a mysterious death curse. Her investigation leads her to the tape, which of course she watches. Rachel sees about a minute worth of footage that includes a ring and a mysterious young girl with long black hair. Rachel receives a telephone call from the girl on the video saying that she will die in seven days. This freaks her out , but she still manages to remain skeptical enough to show the tape to a professional tape editor named Noah ( Martin Henderson) who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend. He also watches the tape and receives the same call. A strange set of events starts to happen that convinces the two that the curse is real. Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman)claims that he can speak to the girl in the video, and draws pictures of its contents to prove it. This pushes Noah and Rachel to believe that Aidan's life is in danger as well, and they both become determined to solve the mystery behind the tape to keep the curse from happening.&quot;The Ring&quot; is without a doubt the best horror film that I have seen in a while. With all of the ridiculous Hollywood slasher films out there, it was nice to finally see a change of pace. The thrills that the film offers are very mature and realistic. The special effects were incredible, and will make you flinch at times. The film overall is fast paced, and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat for the majority of the film. Naomi Watts does a very good job as Rachel. The emotion that she portrays is very realistic, and she looks legitimately scared for her life. Brian Cox and Martin Henderson were also fantastic. However, the best performance was given by David Dorfman who played Rachel's son Aidan. Best performance of a young boy in a horror film since Haley Joel Osmand in &quot; Sixth Sense&quot;. The film does have a few flaws though, which is why I could not give it 5 stars. While the film is well put together and rather terrifying, it can be quite confusing at times. In a movie such as this, the viewer wants to be scared and entertained. But you also want to have an understanding of why it happened. The ending is especially frustrating, because it leaves room for questioning.&quot;The Ring&quot; is an excellent horror film with very few flaws. While you may be slightly confused at the outcome of the film, you will be scared out of your mind and entertained overall. The DVD offers a never-before-seen short film created by the director that reveals secrets about the film. You also get to see a trailer for the film &quot;Ringu&quot;, which is the Japansese film that &quot;The Ring&quot; was based on.",4,"Scary, Suspenseful, and a tad bit confusing....",1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,2911,"['quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'woman', 'named', 'Rachel', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'successful', 'jouranlist', 'investigating', 'death', 'teenage', 'niece', 'According', 'niece', 'friends', 'was', 'due', 'teenage', 'urban', 'myth', 'myth', 'video', 'watch', 'due', 'mysterious', 'death', 'curse', 'investigation', 'tape', 'course', 'Rachel', 'minute', 'worth', 'footage', 'ring', 'mysterious', 'young', 'girl', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'Rachel', 'telephone', 'call', 'girl', 'video', 'saying', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'out', 'still', 'remain', 'skeptical', 'enough', 'show', 'tape', 'professional', 'tape', 'editor', 'named', 'Noah', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'ex-boyfriend', 'also', 'tape', 'same', 'call', 'strange', 'set', 'events', 'starts', 'happen', 'two', 'curse', 'real', 'Rachel', 'son', 'Aidan', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'can', 'speak', 'girl', 'video', 'draws', 'pictures', 'contents', 'prove', 'Noah', 'Rachel', 'believe', 'Aidan', 'life', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'become', 'determined', 'solve', 'mystery', 'tape', 'keep', 'curse', 'happening.', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'doubt', 'best', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'ridiculous', 'Hollywood', 'slasher', 'films', 'there', 'was', 'nice', 'finally', 'see', 'change', 'pace', 'thrills', 'film', 'offers', 'are', 'very', 'mature', 'realistic', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'incredible', 'will', 'make', 'flinch', 'times', 'film', 'overall', 'fast', 'paced', 'suspense', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'majority', 'film', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Rachel', 'emotion', 'very', 'realistic', 'legitimately', 'scared', 'life', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'were', 'also', 'fantastic', 'However', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'given', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'who', 'played', 'Rachel', 'son', 'Aidan', 'Best', 'performance', 'young', 'boy', 'horror', 'film', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmand', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'flaws', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'confusing', 'times', 'movie', 'such', 'viewer', 'be', 'scared', 'entertained', 'also', 'want', 'have', 'understanding', 'why', 'happened', 'ending', 'especially', 'frustrating', 'room', 'questioning.', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'excellent', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'flaws', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'confused', 'outcome', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'mind', 'entertained', 'overall', 'DVD', 'never-before-seen', 'short', 'film', 'created', 'director', 'secrets', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'trailer', 'film', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'Japansese', 'film', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'was', 'based']",N/A

I sure did.The hype surrounding the film notwithstanding, I really watched it with a clear objective eye, and I was very much impressed by what I saw. Being sick and tired with the usual horror movies formula of blood and gore and predictable endings, The Ring provided a fresh alternative, boosted by a very good script, haunting piano and strings score, talented director and excellent acting.I would put the Ring along with The Blair Witch, and the Others as the most intelligent horror movie I have seen since The Omen/Excorist period!! and indeed it is an horror film, despite some reviewers thinking otherwise, for the subject, the tension and the supernatural element makes it so.Speaking of the tension, it is there form the first minute, when the two teenage girls are talking about the deadly tape and the inevitable consequence that sets the mood.The tension did remind me of the Blair Witch, gradually building by each passing day..The similarities with the Blair Witch probably stems from the fact that both film are the brainchild of talented amateur filmmakers on small budgets (I am talking about The Japanese original 'Ringu', which the Ring is 'inspired from' though I have yet to see it to judge whether it was copied frame by frame from the original like many hollywood adaptations (Assasins, Birdcage..etc..) or loosley based on as the filmmakers claim..)Both films have a supernatural edge and an ending that far from giving an answer, deepens the mystery.Like The Omen and The Exorcist, the use the innocence of a child as a vehicle for evil is part of why The Ring works well..The 'evil' tape in question is very well filmed and edited and is truly spooky, especially since we see it at the begining..Yet there are some flaws in the The Ring..The role of the child is under developed, and not as prominent as it is in the Sixth Sense..and some aspect of the plot just does not make any sense..but overall, I give it full marks, because it is an intelligent horror film, that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and because we really need similar films more often.",5,Intelligent Horror,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,2338,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'did', 'film', 'divide', 'way', 'Ring', 'did..either', 'top', 'low', 'marks', 'opinion', 'due', 'film', 'success..it', 'people', 'react', 'think', 'sure', 'did.The', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'notwithstanding', 'really', 'watched', 'clear', 'objective', 'eye', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'impressed', 'what', 'saw', 'Being', 'sick', 'tired', 'usual', 'horror', 'movies', 'formula', 'blood', 'gore', 'predictable', 'endings', 'Ring', 'provided', 'fresh', 'alternative', 'boosted', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'haunting', 'piano', 'strings', 'score', 'talented', 'director', 'excellent', 'acting.I', 'would', 'put', 'Ring', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Others', 'most', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Omen/Excorist', 'period', 'indeed', 'horror', 'film', 'reviewers', 'thinking', 'otherwise', 'subject', 'tension', 'supernatural', 'element', 'so.Speaking', 'tension', 'there', 'form', 'first', 'minute', 'when', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'talking', 'deadly', 'tape', 'inevitable', 'consequence', 'mood.The', 'tension', 'did', 'remind', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'gradually', 'building', 'passing', 'day..The', 'similarities', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'probably', 'fact', 'film', 'are', 'brainchild', 'talented', 'amateur', 'filmmakers', 'small', 'budgets', 'am', 'talking', 'Japanese', 'original', ""'Ringu"", 'Ring', ""'inspired"", 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'judge', 'was', 'copied', 'frame', 'frame', 'original', 'many', 'hollywood', 'adaptations', 'Assasins', 'Birdcage..etc..', 'based', 'filmmakers', 'claim..', 'films', 'have', 'supernatural', 'edge', 'ending', 'far', 'giving', 'answer', 'mystery.Like', 'Omen', 'Exorcist', 'use', 'innocence', 'child', 'vehicle', 'evil', 'part', 'why', 'Ring', 'well..The', ""'evil"", 'tape', 'question', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'edited', 'truly', 'spooky', 'especially', 'see', 'begining..Yet', 'are', 'flaws', 'Ring..The', 'role', 'child', 'developed', 'not', 'as', 'prominent', 'Sixth', 'Sense..and', 'aspect', 'plot', 'just', 'not', 'make', 'sense..but', 'overall', 'give', 'full', 'marks', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'really', 'need', 'similar', 'films', 'more', 'often']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 5]","Of all the horror films to be released as of late, I really did want to see The Ring, basically because I wanted to know how good or bad a PG-13 rated horror movie could be.  After seeing countless horror films trying to be scary and frightening by using predictable tactics and loading on computer generated blood and gore, my faith that horror films of old that didn't rely on blood, gore, and gross out effects to be scary (Poltergeist, Pumpkinhead, the original Halloween) would be returning in films such as The Ring, but I was very disappointed. The film starts out with an eerie opening and some nice scares leading up to an investigation by a reporter (Naomi Watts from Mulholland Drive) into the death of her niece which involved a video tape rumored that if one watches it, seven days later you'll die. While the storyline is interesting and has a bit of originality to it, it seems that director Gore Verbinski wanted the film to be too suspenseful. Not to mention some things are never explained in the film (such as why the horses flipped out) and by the time the credits start rolling you'll have more questions than answers. The acting is pretty well done, but the child actor playing Watts' son seems a bit out of place and a little creepy himself.  What really makes me wonder though is how big a hit The Ring was in theaters, most of which were populated by mid-teen girls who had never heard of and/or seen any films gracing titles like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pumpkinhead, Last House On the Left, or Hellraiser.  Those films were original (the first installments of the ones which became a series that is) and truly deeply scary.  The Ring is simply overrated, and is teen horror at it's near worst.

I saw this with some friends back in November, one of whom had already seen it once before. He warned me that this was no typical horror movie and that it was the scariest movie he had ever seen. So being one not to be scared by movies I didn't think much of this. Wow. Was he ever right.It's about a mysterious videotape that if you watch it, you're supposed to die a week later. Sounds simple, but this movie is somewhat incoherant and confusing. That doesn't stop it from doing what it was made to do, and that's scare you, a lot. At this it succeeds by a long shot. The  deadly video in the movie looks like something straight out of one of the band Tool's videos. The Ring has more than a couple of moments that scare you by instant shock, while messing with your head the whole way through. I think the whole row literally jumped up out of our seats at one part in the movie. So there's never really a dull moment. I love the mood of the film, as it stays dark and dreadful the whole way through.A movie rarely comes along that scares me.

Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted.  The only other ray of hope for this film was the first time we see one of Samara's victims (the blonde in the closet!  Holy crap!  I sure didn't see THAT coming in the theater!), but other than that this film tries and fails to repeat the aura of the first ten minutes for an couple of hours.  Most of it is just too ridiculous.  The horse scene, the electrocution scene, the final TV scene - nothing works.  It's just not good.  The horse/ferry scene is uneccessary, really just a lame attempt to be disturbing.  The electrocution scene is too drawn out and implausible (this is a movie about ghosts coming out of TVs - for a shot to not work in it because it's too fantastic is really something!).This film almost works, or would have, if it ended after our heroine solved the mystery of the tape.  ""Wow,"" I said to myself in the theater as Naomi Watts and her beau walked off into the night, ""They really tried some interesting stuff in that movie.  Not all of it worked, but at least they tried.""  Then the film kept going.  ""Wait,"" I asked myself, ""Why aren't they rolling credits?""  Then it dawned on me that the movie was about to nosedive.  I distinctly remember saying ""No good can come of this."" aloud, referring to the decision to not end the film.  Obviously, I was horrendously disappointed.  After seeing Creepy Little Hospitalized Girl Samara, Soggy Vicious Undead Samara was silly.  The whole set-piece where Noah dies is totally predictable (right down to him tripping over something), Samara isn't scary, and removing frames of film to make movement jerky isn't frightening - it's headache inducing.  God-awful ending to a god-awful movie.After paying for and sitting through all of Open Water in a local theater, my father said this to me: ""That movie was a bad joke.

""The Ring"" is a convuluted tale of a video tape that kills people once they've watched it.  The film begins as urban legend, switches over to psychological thriller, mutates into family melodrama and then comes full circle to try and be a horror movie once again.  There are sparks of originality that get layered onto too much explaining done by the principle characters and not enough of a ""oh my gosh I almost wet my pants!"" sensation to get the whole mess off the ground.Transfer wise: WARNING!!! - this is a movie in which all of the principle characters and their surroundings register in varying degrees of tonal green.  But, as that is the way the film makers intended you to see this film, what can I say?  The green levels are nicely balanced.  Fine detail is generally good, even during the darkest scenes (and this film has a lot of them), black levels are rich and deep and contrast levels (between green and more green) are good. There is some pixelization, particularly during the flashback sequences, that is excessive.  Also, film grain is present throughout and is, at times, distracting.  Audio - well balanced, nothing amazing but lacking in any shortcomings that should be mentioned herein.BOTTOM LINE: If you like this sort of thing, the DVD offers an ample quality that is sure to please.

606616,A2ASL6DAC9UY02,B00005JLTK,Nnie the Hideous New Girl,"[2, 3]","The creators of this film obviously did their research!  This remake not only covers the central plot of the Japanese thriller, Ringu, it also takes into account events of Ringu II and the original content of the novels.  This makes The Ring a nice condensed version of the ""Ring"" story on a whole.  The movie itself is very dark.  Tints of blue, green, and grey make the entire package very bleak as well.  One of the few complaints one my have about the movie is that it tries to hard to be scary.  After we get to see the tape, we're taken on a ride of shocks and chills as the days count down and those creepy, seemingly random images come to life.  Keep in mind that while a lot of the images are relevant to the plot, many do not appear or have any part in Ringu.  A lot was added, mostly for the effect.  What's nice, however, is that most of the creepy tidbits and add-ons are fairly (if not very) effective at making people jump.  There's a lot of great eye candy in The Ring, which is nice for movie goers who are in it more for the thrill than for subtlty.  There's also a lot of symbolism.  Just something fun to do, as you watch, try to think about what the ""ring"" actually is in this movie.  In my opinion, there's more than one ring.The story seems simple enough.  A reporter, Rachel Keller, through the death of her niece, hears the urban legend of a video tape that kills the viewer.  First, you watch it, then you get a phone call in which a creepy voice says, ""Seven days.""  Then you have one week before you die.  There's no stopping it.  When Rachel is given a reason to believe the tale, she hunts down the video for herself, then finds herself watching it.  As the clock starts to count down the time she has left, she consults the help of an old friend, Noah, to help her solve the mystery of the video tape.  We are led to an interesting phrase:  ""Before you die, you see the ring.""The cast is pretty good, but not exceptional.  Naomi Watts as Rachel does a decent job, but Ringu's Reiko (Matsushima Nanako) seemed to have more natural nervous yet composed air to her, while Rachel was sometimes either too composed or too easily rattled.  One of the remake's biggest mistakes was making the part of Aiden so cliche.  In Ringu, he served his purpose merely as the quiet and eerie son who is put in danger.  In The Ring, he is given some sort of psychic ability that we learn little about.  Yet somehow, he is able to predict his cousin's death through pictures and gets messages from a mysterious little girl.  In a way, this dehumanizes him a bit, and he's no longer the innocent little boy that the role seemed to call for.  The actress for Samara, however, was perfect for the part.  Both innocent and creepy, which easily manipulated most of the viewers.  The ending sequence is kept in tact as very similar to the one in Ringu.  Both versions are quite chilling and disturbing, although I did not like the break they made in the Noah/Samara sequence when we see Rachel rushing to get to Noah's.  That didn't seem necessary and made the best part of the movie slightly choppy.  Still, the imagery for many of the key scenes is brilliant.So in conclusion, The Ring is a very well-done and thorough remake of Ringu, including many key parts of the story found in the Japanese sequels as well as some extra tidbits made just for this adaption.  The story is left in tact, making The Ring and Ringu very comparable, and the cast is strong enough to carry the story where needed.

Some of the images are really frightening.  While watching it I really got into it, and thought it was going to find some great way to finesh itself and explain everything.  However, once the movie ended and I looked back on it, I realized something:  The Ring had no plot.  How anything happened, why it was connected to the video tape, none of it was explained.  The movie was very complex, and you had to think to get what was going on, but despite this it still maneged to not truely make sence.Anyway, in the end, it was a frightning foray into horror, and was able to make me remain somewhat scared and  keep my lights on and  long after my TV had been turned off.  And that is a sign of a good horror movie. So if you're in the mood to be frightened, go out and rent this flick. Just be prepared to never want to watch TV again.A little side note:  The Ring is actually based on a Japanese movie which in turn is based on a novel.  The Japanese movie is now available here in the U.S. under the tiltle of Ringu, so anyone who just can't get enough of the Ringshould check it out.

And that's the point and something that the VAST majority of horror films fail to accomplish.  The cinematography reminded me of &quot;Seven&quot; and, as someone else mentioned, &quot;the Cell.&quot;  Imbued with a seemingly simplistic idea about an urban legend about a tape that kills its viewers within 7 days, this taut film is propelled by superb direction and genuinely creepy shots interspersed throughout the film that will startle and scare.The film's lead character is played quite well by Naomi Watts (who continues sharpening her acting chops following her excellent turn in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;) from the start.  Her race against time is compelling and not without many surprises.  The supporting cast is exceptional as well with another great supporting performance from Brian Cox as a troubled father.  The make-up work is also quite excellent as I still can't get those dead people out of my head!  The horror aspect of the film makes this more of an Exorcist-type film, rather than the twists of &quot;The Others.&quot;  The audience is not allowed to be de-sensitized to some slasher style ghost or anything and that appears to be the secret to horror for today's jaded audiences.  Less is literally more.  And it works brilliantly!

606627,AJ36PN55LTKC7,B00005JLTK,Philip Wester,"[0, 0]","Watching ""The Ring"" is like watching a light version of ""Ringu"" 1 and 2. At that's exactly what it is. A mix of the plots of the two 1st ""Ringu"" movies (per example the screen that the 1st victim's friend uses to avoid seeing the TV is from ""Ringu 2""). And when I say light, I mean with less plot, more action/special effects sequences and, well, simply less frightening.They also added things that weren't there in the first place at the expense of other things. The father having the power ESP might sound stupid to some, but it explains the son's visions. And why did they have to add an entire scene with a horse gone mad? Why did the horse go mad anyway? It's not like Samara intended to [do away with] Rachel with that horse. There were several days left! Ok, so Samara hated horses, still, why? Well, that was 5 minutes wasted for no good reason.And there's too much music. In the original ""Ringu"" movie, there was less music, which added to the eerie atmosphere. And as others have said before, the movie is too self-explainatory. Who in their right mind would sit at home after that her ex-husband/ex-boyfriend was killed by a mysterious girl through a TV-screen and ask herself ""What did I do that you didn't? *SEES VIDEOTAPE* I copied it... and showed it to you..."". Sounds like a kid's movie.And the ending was a bit disappointing. ""So what will happen to the people that we show it to? Will they die too?"".It's a good enough movie, though.

It's best classified as psychological horror. There are no monsters, things that jump out at you, or any cliched horror movie staples. Rather, the horror comes from the subtle yet disturbing imagery throughout the film, especially on the Tape. This is a thinking person's horror movie, and tells its story through hints, both visual and in the screenplay.As you know by now, the plot revolves around a mysterious videotape that somehow results in your demise exactly 7 days after being seen. The central character is a reporter, excellently portrayed by Naomi Watts, who investigates the source of this killer tape after her niece becomes a victim. Naomi follows the clues on the tape like a modern day Nancy Drew and is led to a spooky island that is obviously the one shown on the tape. From there, she meets a strange family with a bunch of sinister secrets that are revealed to us one by one. The mystery element is very effective, and keeps you involved in the story. The conclusion clearly leaves room for a sequel, which has obviously already been made.The acting is excellent, as is the writing.

Give me gore, I don't flinch, but give me supernatural and I quake with fear. This movie seems to have been made with my greatest fears inside. I can relate to this so much!!! Have a look at this list!1. My name is Rachel2. I'm claustrophobic, in fact I can't close my eyes in the shower I'm that bad, so you can imagine what I would be like stuck down a well3. I'm scared of the dark. I always sleep with a light on (I'm not a kid either)4. I'm scared of horses. I used to horse-ride as a kid and due to many falls and bites I have concluded there is something about me they don't like.5. I'm scared of televisions when they are tuned off, because they reflect the room in a weird way6. I'm scared of mirrors7. I'm scared of getting electrocuted in the bathtub.The list goes on.So you can imagine how scared I was. I have re-occurring nightmares. It's my thing. After I saw the ring I dreamt for a week that sadako (the Japanese version, I've seen both) was sat on the edge of my bed. Also I have a TV in my room and now I can't sleep facing it. I still see things in the reflection. Okay I'm a mess. This film has really frightened me and even as I'm typing this review I'm feeling uneasy. I just want to make some comparisons between the American and Japanese version. In the Japanese version I think that sadako was much scarier. The fact that she was a grown woman was more threatening, also you never saw her face and there is nothing more scarier then the unknown. Also the to screen at the end was more realistic because she looked real. In the American version samara was all blue and grainy but sadako is totally natural. You could really see her red fingertips where the nails had been ripped off. Also the crawl across the floor was much slower and more heart pounding. Plus she's just plain evil, with no explanation as to why. I'm getting scared again, the computer just clicked. However I like Noah in the American version. He's really hot. He he. The visuals and music are much creepier in the American version as well. I can't compare the scared faces as I closed my eyes at that part. I always do. In fact I had to see the movie 5 times before I had the courage to look at samara's face at the end. I'm glad I did because she looks like me when I'm cross. Didn't scare me. Did I mention I have hair just like her that tends to fall over my face?Anyway this film is very scary if you have a very overactive imagination and tend to get creeped out by the supernatural.

I was sho cked this movie was not given a ""R"" rating. I have seen other horror flicks that are rated R and are really not that bad. It's so scary with very little gore and the music is scary too. The perfect combination for a good movie.This movie is based on the Japanese movie The Ringu which came out in 1998 in Japan. It's about a cursed video tape that after you watch it you get a phone call with a chilling voice saying "" 7 days"". Naomi Watts plays a Seattle based reporter named Rachael. She has to solve the mystery of the tape after an unexplained death occurs. She is skeptical at first about a tape floating around that kills people.  But after hearing more about the tape and learning of other coinciding mysterious deaths; she finally decides to investigate and watch the tape. While watching the tape she slowly starts to learn that its not a hoax . She also receives chilling phone call after viewing it. Rachael now has 7 days to solve the mystery or she is dead too. The video tape itself is eerie as hell with some very disturbing images. The images give clues that we see during the whole movie which Rachael and Noah research and try to painstakingly figure out.Whoever made the tape draws Rachael more into the tape to the point where she starts to hallucinate, physcially feel things related to the tape, scribling something on a piece of paper making a horse go crazy, and nose bleeds. The tape is somehow using Rachael to let her know how this person felt physcially. Racheal is also mentally drawn into the tape in 2 scenes. Noah is also drawn into the tape after he watches it and only experiences nose bleeds.  Aiden finally watches the tape too and experiences nose bleeds and hallucinations from which something mysteriously ends up on both his wrists. After seeing this Rachael does everything she can to save her son.The Seatle setting is very rainy and chilly so it makes it even scary and the Racheal's son Aiden ( David Dorfman) is a little freeky to and seems to know what's going on, what will happen, or what has happened. He talks about someone he seems to know but how he knows this person is really interresting. He reminds me of the little kid Danny from The Shining. Does he have some special connection to the tape which remains to be asked. The movie is pretty interesting though and keeps you guessing till the very end. The music throughout the whole movie is well composed and it does wonders to some of the scenes throughout. Even then it's hard to figure out unless you watch it again. Place close attention to the film because many scenes relate back to the tape and it will help you understand it better. This is also very pyschological too. Its just to great to describe. I would not considered it your typical horror movie because the elements are different than the regular slasher flicks we see these days. I highly recommend it!!!! You will be so scared!! There is also an extra edition on this DVD which have more scary scenes that were edited from the original and give more clues.

But anyway.To synopsise:  Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is investigating the possibility of an Urban Legend being responsible for s spate of recent teenage deaths. The Legend in question concerns a videotape which, when watched, lets you know that you have a week to live. When she herslef falls prey to the Curse she enlists the help of her old partner Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) to stop the fatal event from taking place.And from there on in, what we're left with is a mundanely-acted but beautifully-shot picture full of gorgeous and spooky set-pieces (the lighthouse, the barn, the asylum).Watts and Henderson are there as perfunctory eye-candy, secondary to the ingenious plot and chilling photography. Director Gore Verbinski should be proud of himself  for having done such an impressive job with monochromatic shots, the Seattle weather and minimal special effects. The overall visual impression of 'The Ring' is truly unsettling.The acting isn't so hot, and the ridiculous, pointless sequence with the horses on the ferry goes nowhere and does nothing. There are several horrible horror-movie cliches here too, like the boy-teen at the start of the flick with near-ESP ('they're all gonna die, maaaan) that we really could have done without.For all of that, though, 'The Ring' works well as a modern standalone horror movie, and is certainly one of the betterHollywood offerings of recent years.On the other hand, when one watches the original 'Ringu', you'll understand what i mean. Less overstated, less effects-laden and far , far more effecting, 'Ringu' is a Classic. 'The Ring' is not. But if you've not seen either, start with the American version.To rent, not to buy.",3,Decent remake that cannot compare to the original in any way,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1998,"['hate', 'be', 'movie', 'snob', 'actually', 'lie', 'love', 'being', 'movie', 'snob', 'have', 'say', 'when', 'taken', 'own', 'American', 'remake', 'classic', 'japanese', ""'Ring"", 'more', 'own', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'classic.When', 'taken', 'in-context', 'remake', 'however', 'most', 'count', 'anyway.To', 'synopsise', 'Rachel', 'Keller', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'investigating', 'possibility', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'being', 'responsible', 's', 'spate', 'recent', 'teenage', 'deaths', 'Legend', 'question', 'concerns', 'videotape', 'when', 'watched', 'know', 'have', 'week', 'live', 'When', 'herslef', 'falls', 'prey', 'Curse', 'help', 'old', 'partner', 'Noah', 'Clay', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'stop', 'fatal', 'event', 'taking', 'place.And', 'there', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'mundanely-acted', 'beautifully-shot', 'picture', 'full', 'gorgeous', 'spooky', 'set-pieces', 'lighthouse', 'barn', 'asylum', '.Watts', 'Henderson', 'are', 'there', 'perfunctory', 'eye-candy', 'secondary', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'chilling', 'photography', 'Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'having', 'done', 'impressive', 'job', 'monochromatic', 'shots', 'Seattle', 'weather', 'minimal', 'special', 'effects', 'overall', 'visual', 'impression', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'truly', 'unsettling.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'so', 'hot', 'ridiculous', 'pointless', 'sequence', 'horses', 'ferry', 'nowhere', 'nothing', 'are', 'several', 'horrible', 'horror-movie', 'cliches', 'here', 'too', 'boy-teen', 'start', 'flick', 'near-ESP', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'maaaan', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'without.For', 'though', 'Ring', 'works', 'well', 'modern', 'standalone', 'horror', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'betterHollywood', 'offerings', 'recent', 'years.On', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'one', 'original', ""'Ringu"", ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'Less', 'overstated', 'less', 'effects-laden', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'effecting', ""'Ringu"", 'Classic', 'Ring', 'not', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'either', 'start', 'American', 'version.To', 'rent', 'not', 'buy']",N/A
606642,A2PPZNGRLFDUX0,B00005JLTK,"R. Hudak ""Hudak-Budak""","[0, 0]","First of all, let's go over what's right with this movie. The scary parts are actually scary. You do jump. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time that has actually scared me. The first time I saw it in the theater, I was on the edge of my seat and felt jittery when the movie got tense. That's a good thing.What's wrong with the movie? To start, the acting. Naomi Watts has got to be one of my least favorite actresses, and she's just not that convincing in this roll. Also, the omniscient little kid has been way overdone since Sixth Sense. He was totally unneeded, and a bad child actor at that.The realism needs some working on as well. Now, I know it's a horror movie and some facets of reality need to be suspended, but there are some things that are inexcusable. At one point, Rachel is running around furiously trying to get ready for a wake, and her son is calmly finishing up, tying his tie. This kid couldn't have been older than six, and he can tie a tie? I'm 21 and still have trouble with that.I also saw no point in doing anything with a relationship between Rachel and Noah. It was pointless and had nothing to do with the story. Maybe they should have spent less time with building up that the kid was theirs and more time explaining how in world Samara got her supernatural powers. And why a videotape?The bottom line, however, is that if you're a film student, you probably won't like this movie. If you're just looking for a few scares or something to watch to make your girlfriend cuddle up a little closer to you, this is it.

606643,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JLTK,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[1, 1]","...Still, it wasn't a bad film by any means. I might not agree with others that it was the scariest movie ever, but I thought it was skillfully-made and had some genuinely creepy moments. I really liked the overall atmosphere it created, and the effects were subtle, for the most part, not overdone. The meat of it is that I enjoyed it. It's a good scary movie, though classics like ""The Haunting"" are still scarier.The thing I think I appreciated most about ""The Ring"" is that it wasn't trying to be a ""hip"" scary movie, like the ""Scream"" series or its many clones. It was a serious, genuine attempt at a classic horror film.The first 5 to 10 minutes of ""The Ring"" probably represents the most genuinely scary part of the whole movie. This was a good way to go, as it certainly put me on edge for the rest of the movie.When one starts looking at particulars, it gets even better. The main subject of the film (as is probably well-known by now) is a videotape which, once watched, somehow guarantees that the person who watched it will die in exactly seven days. The reason for this is somewhat explained by the end of the film. As a video geek, I liked some of the details thrown in about the tape itself, such as the fact (revealed fairly early) that it has no timecode track, and any copies made similarly have no time track. As a practical matter, this is pretty much an impossibility. Which is why this detail creeped me out quite a bit, and certainly lent a great deal to the mystery of the origin of the tape.Another nice detail was the way the images from the tape are worked into the days that follow. It's not made obvious in all cases, as in through a flashback or anything, but if one is observant pretty much every disturbing image from the tape (and there are some very disturbing images) is reflected in a similar image in the events after it is viewed. One exception to this turned out to be in a deleted scene on the DVD, so it was clearly intentional, even if not quite completely carried out. Some of the parallels between ""real life"" and the tape are subtle, but they are definitely there.One really surprising thing about the film was the music, which was understated and subtle throughout. This is not surprising in itself, but it is when you consider the composer. I thought perhaps it might have been Maurice Jarre or even Thomas Newman, with their tendency towards quiet undertones and ambient sounds. The surprise came at the end when I saw in the credits that Hans Zimmer, usually author of skilled but over-the-top scores such as ""Gladiator"" or ""Mission: Impossible 2,"" had worked on ""The Ring."" I admire Zimmer and I enjoy his scores in general, but he truly outdid himself for this film. The music is a strong counterpoint to the atmosphere of the movie, and Zimmer abandoned his usually-identifiable style and allowed the tone of the film to set the tone of his score. He had a soft touch with the music, for once, and it really added a great deal to the movie.As for the scary stuff, there was plenty there to be found. Though I have to say, ""The Ring"" is not so much scary as it is intense. Somewhat like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""The Ring"" sets up an effective tone early on, and never really lets up. Through a steady series of surprises, it manages to keep the audience guessing about what's going to happen next. I won't give away any of the specifics, because if you haven't seen it yet then they're best seen fresh, and my description likely wouldn't do it justice anyway. But basically, as you watch the film and think that something can't happen, that what's about to happen is impossible... that's when it does. I had several ""gasp"" moments during the film, because it managed to surprise me several times. And the effects were done well enough that even such impossiblities remained convincing. The scares in ""The Ring"" are well-placed and skillfully executed. During the film I was sucked right into it, only afterwards could I start to appreciate how well it had been done.The end result is that ""The Ring"" is a good, solid horror film, and makes no pretensions otherwise. Though not as good as some of the classics, it definitely hearkens back to the days of movies like ""The Haunting"" or ""Rosemary's Baby,"" as one of those rare horror movies that simply accomplishes what it sets out to do - scare the heck out of you - and is satisfied. Which is not to say there is not some social commentary inherent in the film, even though it takes a back seat to the story. The fact that the film's terrors reach us through our new media - television, video, and telephone - says something about the pervasiveness of these media. We trust them implicitly as methods of communication and modes of entertainment. ""The Ring"" seems to suggest that this trust is not earned, that these media can be used for evil as much as they can be used for good. That message blinking on the answering machine is an unknown quantity until you listen to it, that videotape is a mystery until you watch it, and a screen full of static may be the most frightening thing of all.",4,See the DVD...

Usually American remakes of foreign films are a bad idea, and this is no exception.Though many people who have seen this film find it scary, and I checked it out after several recommendations, personally, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was not scared at all, though I watched it alone, late at night, in a house out in the woods. Perhaps I just don't scare easily though, and I admit the plot was interesting-- albeit resolved in a mundane and predictable way.Urban Legend holds that viewers of a particular video will die seven days after seeing the film. There's a way to avoid this fate, but it comes only by stumbling onto it accidentally. The tape itself contains no clue as to its origin or auteur, and the plot revolves around the aunt of one of the tape's victims desperately trying to track down the demons responsible for this horrible thing.This film suffers from lackluster acting; the one really good thing about it is that the killer tape itself is quite unnerving.

Mind you this isn't one of those movies where the entire plot is spoonfed to you, but its fairly easy to understand MOST of what's going on. I felt that it was less of a ghost story and more of a 'mystery' type thing. Either way, the whole premise of a videotape that can kill you is creepy in itself. The movie's ending is a bit bizarre and frightening at the same time; I've yet to comprehend some of what was going on.Anyways, the DVD isn't that spectacular; the only extra features are a short-film(which fills up some of the plot-holes and shows some new scenes and what seems to be an alternate ending) and a trailer for Ringu and one for Catch Me If You Can.

Zwick,"[4, 6]","Like so many horror films of recent vintage,  ""The Ring"" is far more effective in its setup than it is in its execution.The film starts off with a promising premise.  A group of teenagers watch a mysterious videotape that predicts that each of them will die in seven days.  When the prophecy turns out to be true, Rachel, the aunt of one of the victims, decides to do some investigating of her own to uncover the facts behind this strange supernatural phenomenon.  The problem is that not only has Rachel herself seen the tape (which looks for all the world like outtakes from ""Un Chien Andalou""), but so also have her ex-boyfriend and little son.  Her search for answers thus becomes a matter of life-and-death not merely for herself but for her loved ones as well.""The Ring"" has some nice moments of suspense right up front, but the more Rachel unravels the mystery the less mysterious and terrifying the film becomes.  This seems to be a common failing in many horror films and ""The Ring"" finds no real way to overcome it.  Naomi Watts is energetic and attractive as the feisty heroine of the story, but the clues she uncovers just aren't very interesting or compelling.  ""The Ring"" is competently made and nicely atmospheric at times, but it doesn't get under your skin the way the best horror films invariably do.  Perhaps it's because the tape itself ceases to become a threat early on once the three main characters have all had a crack at watching it.  All we are left to do is watch Rachel racing against the clock looking for answers, turning ""The Ring"" into more of a whodunit mystery than a tale of terror.  This might be acceptable if the ""solution"" weren't a hackneyed bit of Grand Guignol idiocy that we've seen hundreds of times before.""The Ring"" is a watchable little time waster but it won't keep you up at night and it won't make you think twice before popping that next videotape into your VCR.",2,ho hum thriller,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,1914,"['so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'vintage', 'Ring', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'setup', 'execution.The', 'film', 'promising', 'premise', 'group', 'teenagers', 'watch', 'mysterious', 'videotape', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'When', 'prophecy', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'Rachel', 'aunt', 'one', 'victims', 'decides', 'do', 'investigating', 'own', 'uncover', 'facts', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'phenomenon', 'problem', 'not', 'only', 'Rachel', 'seen', 'tape', 'world', 'outtakes', 'Un', 'Chien', 'Andalou', 'so', 'also', 'have', 'ex-boyfriend', 'little', 'son', 'search', 'answers', 'thus', 'matter', 'life-and-death', 'not', 'merely', 'herself', 'loved', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'Ring', 'nice', 'moments', 'suspense', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'more', 'Rachel', 'mystery', 'less', 'mysterious', 'terrifying', 'film', 'be', 'common', 'failing', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'Ring', 'real', 'way', 'overcome', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'energetic', 'attractive', 'feisty', 'heroine', 'story', 'clues', 'uncovers', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'Ring', 'competently', 'made', 'nicely', 'atmospheric', 'times', ""n't"", 'get', 'skin', 'way', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'invariably', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'tape', 'become', 'threat', 'early', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'had', 'crack', 'watching', 'are', 'left', 'do', 'watch', 'Rachel', 'racing', 'clock', 'looking', 'answers', 'turning', 'Ring', 'more', 'whodunit', 'mystery', 'tale', 'terror', 'might', 'be', 'acceptable', 'solution', 'were', ""n't"", 'hackneyed', 'bit', 'Grand', 'Guignol', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'times', 'Ring', 'watchable', 'little', 'time', 'waster', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'night', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'popping', 'next', 'videotape', 'VCR']",N/A

It's smart, expertly crafted, tense, beautiful, and damn good storytelling. You care about these characters, and the director knew how to scare you. I can't recommend it enough. Even having seen the original Japanese film first, I think this movie is far superior. While Ringu was also well done, it had some flaws such as *spoilers* the ending where she's taking the tape to her dad to have him watch it. Isn't there anybody else who could see it? You're really going to get your own father killed? And then there's the way you get information in the original... through her psychic ex-husband (something they did away with in the remake). You also have the fade to black and white when somebody dies, which just seems like the filmmaker didn't know what else to do. *end spoilers* The Ring really shows Naomi's character as a reporter, uncovering clues and piecing together the mystery. It draws you in and keeps the story moving at just the right pace. The movie's atmosphere is incredible. It's extremely creepy and gets under your skin. When the last frightening scene rolls around, you'll definitely be on edge.The DVD really has nothing worthwhile in terms of special features, which is very disappointing. The movie is so good though that you should buy it anyway, and you should try to track down the Rings short film that they put out with this. It's also amazing.

606656,A2AD4T5FXJWNMU,B00005JLTK,Rosan,"[0, 1]","A true connoisseur of the scary movie (note, not slasher flicks but psychological thrillers) will recognize certain spooky elements in many of the ""classics"" of the genre: the cruel parent (or stepparent); the otherworldly child, a medium for the spirit world; and, the violent reaction of animals, children and the insane to the presence of evil. Certain images are also commonly found in these movies and are preternaturally disturbing: wells, bleak cliffs, lighthouses, remote cabins in the woods, lone autumnal trees on hillsides, rainy nights, and other symbols of isolation.Renowned mythologist, Joseph Campbell, argued that certain tales and images are part of our universal consciousness and, therefore, part of collective human storytelling. Heavily influenced by Carl Jung, Campbell described how these themes reoccur throughout the tapestry of stories told by groups divided by time and geography. Perhaps then there should be no surprise that certain images reappear with such alarming effectiveness in scary movies whether the source is Hollywood, or in this case, Japan.Based on ""Ringu"", a series of books by Kji Suzuki (the ""Stephen King of Japan""), Hideo Nakata directed the original, record-breaking box office smash for Asian audiences (1998), which DreamWorks decided would translate well for American audiences. Gore Verbinski was chosen to direct even though he is best known for more light-hearted fare such as ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican.""The premise is fairly simple. Urban legend meets scary movie reality when four teens die, as predicted, exactly seven days to the minute from when they watched an unmarked video in a remote mountain cabin. The aunt of one of the teenagers is a savvy and skeptical journalist whose curiosity is sparked by tales of the tape. After finding and watching the source of the mystery, she receives a phone call announcing that she has seven days. From there, it is a race to solve the clues and answer the riddle of the video, with the stakes greatly raised when two of the people closest to her, including her young son, watch the deadly tape.The video itself is a mosaic of images both familiar and disturbing. With its mirrors, wriggly things, ladders, and-of course -- rings, you might think you were watching ""Un Chien Andalou"" (Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Salvador Dali's 1929 surrealist classic) as directed by David Lynch after he had been reading Jung and not getting enough fresh air.As one born to the genre, Director Verbinski does an excellent job of letting our imaginations find portent and peril in the most mundane of actions, such as picking up groceries at the local corner store. Naomi Watts, a relatively unknown actress for those who missed her in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), plays Rachel, the journalist whose desire to find the cause of her niece's death becomes a life or death quest for answers. For all of us who have rolled our eyes at the screaming teen, walking backward alone through the dark house, Watts will be a relief as she plays through the gamut of Rachel's emotions with truly credible, but not overwrought, gusto. While the adults are busy solving the riddle of the tape, the heart-stopping dyad of the Ring's children usher in the deeper dimension of fear. Rachel's son, Aiden (a stony-eyed David Dorfman) is the medium and interpreter for the terrifying Samara (Daveigh Chase), who lays at the heart of the mystery.""The Ring"" dips deep in the well of those aforementioned familiar scary images, which paradoxically results in a movie that is both architecturally firm but-with little new to add-empty of true revelation. Joseph Campbell could have used this movie as a reference book for universally terrifying images, but perhaps the tale itself was more effectively told in Japanese.Parents should know that this movie is very, very scary. Four people and a horse die on-screen, with the potential for many more untimely demises throughout and-don't read on if you enjoy surprises-beyond the end of the movie. The overall tone is creepy and would leave many of the staunchest of movie-goers in dire need of brightly lit rooms and laughter.Families who see this movie should talk about the decision that Rachel makes at the end of the movie and the ramifications of her actions. They might also wish to discuss the way that different characters deal with the untimely death of a loved one.Families who enjoy this movie might wish to shiver together over ""The Shining"", ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". Alternately, they might wish to never watch a video again (especially an unmarked one) and opt to have a Scrabble night instead, preferably after turning on all the lights in the house.",4,"I found

606659,A2UHPTUFMLQWBE,B00005JLTK,Ryan McNabb,"[3, 8]","This is the American remake of a Japanese movie, based on Japanese novels and manga, or adult comic books.  It is post modern, cynical, and basically juvenile in nature, and as such appeals to huge, numberless hoardes of people out there.  The images are shocking, terrifying, unforgettable...but the plot has holes you could throw a cat through.  This doesn't really matter, though, because its intended audience isn't a product of the literary genre, but rather the visual one.  Therefore, it's a film based on images rather than story line.A young girl becomes a ghost when she is killed by her own mother by being thrown down a well.  This ghost chooses a modern and highly technical way of avenging herself: victims must make copies of video tapes to avoid being killed.  This odd melding of the spiritual with the technical sheds a little light onto the distorted origins of this tale.  The fact that we aren't told vast amounts of explanatory material, that we don't know (in the end) anything about anyone in this film, that there is no moral, that there is no resolution, that motive and causation are left out of the mix, matters not a whit.  The modern audience isn't trained to look for these things, so it doesn't miss them when they're gone.  Give people gorgeous, shocking images, and they're happy - they'll grin from ear to ear.I give it 3 stars because it's genuinely very scary, and scary in new ways that I've really not seen before.  The &quot;cursed video&quot; that everyone watches is extremely upsetting, in the same way the the film &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; was.  The nightmare of the murder and the ordeal in the well fill our minds with horrible images.  So on purely technical grounds, it's a solid effort. But the fact that movies like this make us feel frightened, disoriented, alone, bereft, harmed, confused...none of that seems to bother anyone.  Why do we seek out &quot;entertainment&quot; that assaults us?  No easy answers.&quot;The Ring&quot; has, of course, achieved cult status, and all the gaping plot flaws and confusing omissions (I don't know how many times I said &quot;HUH??&quot; during this movie) are neatly filled in by lots of confabulating fans filling in the details. In fact, the less you tell kids these days, the more they like it - it lets them spend weeks on the internet researching nonsense, basically writing your story for you as they go.  But who cares?  All I'm left with is the very pained, nauseated feeling that I watched a movie about a child that was thrown down a well and whose ghost is now horribly murdering innocent people, and many people think this is a profitable use of their time, that they derived enjoyment from it, that they are better for the experience.  I challenge you to ponder this concept, and what it means about the state of our souls, and not be bothered by it.",3,The real post modern nightmare is us...,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,2856,"['American', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'based', 'Japanese', 'novels', 'manga', 'adult', 'comic', 'books', 'post', 'modern', 'cynical', 'basically', 'juvenile', 'nature', 'such', 'appeals', 'huge', 'numberless', 'hoardes', 'people', 'there', 'images', 'are', 'shocking', 'terrifying', 'unforgettable', 'plot', 'holes', 'could', 'throw', 'cat', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'though', 'intended', 'audience', ""n't"", 'product', 'literary', 'genre', 'rather', 'visual', 'one', 'Therefore', 'film', 'based', 'images', 'rather', 'story', 'line.A', 'young', 'girl', 'ghost', 'when', 'killed', 'own', 'mother', 'being', 'thrown', 'down', 'well', 'ghost', 'modern', 'highly', 'technical', 'way', 'avenging', 'victims', 'must', 'make', 'copies', 'video', 'tapes', 'avoid', 'being', 'killed', 'odd', 'melding', 'spiritual', 'technical', 'sheds', 'little', 'light', 'distorted', 'origins', 'tale', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'vast', 'amounts', 'explanatory', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'end', 'anything', 'anyone', 'film', 'moral', 'resolution', 'motive', 'causation', 'are', 'left', 'mix', 'matters', 'not', 'whit', 'modern', 'audience', ""n't"", 'trained', 'look', 'things', ""n't"", 'miss', 'when', ""'re"", 'gone', 'Give', 'people', 'gorgeous', 'shocking', 'images', ""'re"", 'happy', ""'ll"", 'grin', 'ear', 'ear.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'genuinely', 'very', 'scary', 'scary', 'new', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'really', 'not', 'seen', 'before', 'quot', 'cursed', 'video', 'quot', 'everyone', 'watches', 'extremely', 'upsetting', 'same', 'way', 'film', 'quot', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'quot', 'was', 'nightmare', 'murder', 'ordeal', 'well', 'fill', 'minds', 'horrible', 'images', 'So', 'purely', 'technical', 'grounds', 'solid', 'effort', 'fact', 'movies', 'make', 'feel', 'frightened', 'disoriented', 'alone', 'bereft', 'harmed', 'confused', 'none', 'bother', 'anyone', 'Why', 'do', 'seek', 'out', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'assaults', 'No', 'easy', 'answers.', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'course', 'achieved', 'cult', 'status', 'gaping', 'plot', 'flaws', 'confusing', 'omissions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'said', 'quot', 'HUH', 'quot', 'movie', 'are', 'neatly', 'filled', 'lots', 'confabulating', 'fans', 'filling', 'details', 'fact', 'less', 'tell', 'kids', 'days', 'more', 'spend', 'weeks', 'internet', 'researching', 'nonsense', 'basically', 'writing', 'story', 'go', 'who', ""'m"", 'left', 'very', 'pained', 'nauseated', 'feeling', 'watched', 'movie', 'child', 'was', 'thrown', 'down', 'well', 'ghost', 'now', 'horribly', 'murdering', 'innocent', 'people', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'profitable', 'use', 'time', 'derived', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'better', 'experience', 'challenge', 'ponder', 'concept', 'what', 'state', 'souls', 'not', 'be', 'bothered']",N/A

Sure, they can spruce it up with updated special effects, more shock tactics and disturbing visuals, young attractive actors and new creepy dialogue - but you're watching an entirely different film altogether.  You're watching the Americans greedily try to claim something their own and make it look better.  The Hollywood plastic factory ruins yet another unique concept and form of cinematography.The best thing about 'Ringu' the original was that they didn't rely on updated special effects or creating an overlly modern look.  It was realistic and gripping because it was so raw and simplistic.  They focused moreso on the element of drama and realism.  The narrative and visual sequences were full of symbolism and artistic integrity.Another thing that made this movie (Ringu, the original) so appealing was the fact it was Japanese and not sensationalised consumerist American slop.  It delivered the message that not all good horror films are American, they don't all need to be traditional and excessively gory and it emphasized the fact that fear is universal by showing how it is depicted in a different culture.  I think a lot of Westerners detach themselves from the rest of the world and it seems unimportant and irrelevant that people in other cultures experience the same horrors.

However, the storyline was unclear regarding the relationships between the characters. For example, the little boy in the film called his mom by her first name instead of calling her mom. I was confused about their relationship. Was he her young brother, her nephew, or did he have a bad relationship toward his mother? The movie offered no clear explanation why the little boy called his mother by her first name.The movie also offered no explanation why the girl in the well wants to continue her haunting and killing spree. Perhaps, The Ring part two will give the movie audience a clear answer to that question.Also, the movie was slow with no action for over 40 minutes that the director and producer should have shortened to maybe 10-15 minutes.I feel that characters were not developed enough so that the audience could easily understand the little boy's odd behavior or the past relationship between the mother and her male friend.Hopefully, part two will clear up the confusion that part one's storyline contained.This movie was not horrible. The actors were decent. One familiar face is in the movie's opening scene. She was also in the Grude part 1 & 2 as the sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar.This movie is similiar to the Grudge because of the scary spirit that's in the form of a murdered little girl.Despite the unclear storyline, I give this movie three stars due to good special effects and the potential to be very suspenseful.

Did not sleep for around 3 days afterwards. . .then again I did watch it 3 nights in a row.It has held up, I watched it last Halloween and although it wasn't scary this time around I still enjoyed it and realized that it is a really good movie as far as filming goes, great locations, sets, and thus atmosphere.  Acting wasn't half bad either and you know, a ghost coming through a TV screen is freaky.  I'm sorry, some people said it was dumb but EVERYONE watches TV, they are everywhere, so if the ghost can get you that way then it is going to get you sooner or later.The second movie took it down a few notches though, not because it was good but because it was horrible, if I could forget it I would enjoy this movie much more.I'm going to get it on Blu-ray, this is a movie that I enjoyed multiple times and probably will multiple times more.  My DVD copy is kinda beat up and I notice it isn't as clear as it could be.  This movie has apparently come out on Bluray last march and it got 4.8/5 on video and 4.5/5 on audio on blu-ray.com and that site is picky.  The only thing it did poor on was Extras, a measly 2.8/5, but I don't care just as long as it has a way to access the full 'ring' movie that get you killed like the DVD had.

They're almost always at least good, but many times a fair bit behind the original versions.  'The Ring', the movie that started the trend, is actually one of the ones that exceeds its predecessor.  It keeps everything that madeRingugood, but benefits from some added angles, better special effects, and deeper characterization on some of the supporting players.  Also, it's not a shot-by-shot remake: in several instances backstory elements have been substitued for an alternate take on things.  In this case, both the original and the remake had equally cool takes on the backstory.  But I've always felt that if you're going to do a remake you just have to do Some things differently so it actually Is a different take on the same idea, not just a reshooting of the exact same movie.  The Ring differentiated itself enough so that you'll want to watch both versions, and enjoy not only the same theme but the differences here and there.  [Note - there's also a third version,The Ring Virus, a Korean remake of Ringu that came out, I believe, before the American remake.  I've really got to get on the ball and see that one too.)The basic premise behind The Ring is now one of the best known set-ups in horror: there's a videotape out there, of unknown origin, and everyone who watches it dies exactly seven days later.  In addition, immediately after watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call as a warning of their fate.  You never hear exactly what's said on the call, but you can just make out enough of it that, by that and the reaction of the person receiving the call (this is one of the things that really made The Ring so great - the tremendous jobs various performers did in reacting to things that aren't fully shown on screen) it really brings an instant air of sinister otherworldliness.  Naomi Watts plays the reporter who investigates this strange urban legend after four kids die after watching the tape - one of them her niece - and eventually comes into possession of the tape itself.  Totally disbelieving of any truth to the supernatural legend, she nonetheless watches the tape, looking for possible clues.  And proceeds to receive the phone call that all viewers are said to receive.  It quickly becomes impossible to discount anything about the legend, and worse still, Watts is horrified to get up one morning and find her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) innocently watching the video he found.  Now it's a race against time to track down the origins of the tape and try to stop the curse before it reaches its fated conclusion.  The trail leads to the story of a little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase), now dead several years...The Ring is a multi-layered horror story that gets scarier and scarier as it unfolds, riveting from the start but leaving the biggest and most memorable frights for the end stages.  The visual imagery of The Ring has become iconic in horrordom, including the stone well, first seen on the videotape itself, and the climax is a masterpiece.  Outstanding performances all around.

Naomi Watts is outstanding in the lead role, but all the supporting cast members are terrific as well.  If you like or love the blood and gore kinds of films, then this movie will certainly disappoint you as the focus is on character, story, and mood (which is wonderfully done due to the suberb cinematography, unique special effects, and make-up).This is an outstandingly produced film and one not to be missed.

606686,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JLTK,Takis Tz.,"[0, 0]","A couple of notes before my thoughts about the film:1. There's an ongoing barrage of comments in the reviews here in Amazon with people saying that the original Japanese version (Ringu) is better or more subtle and that you ""should see that one first"" or that the American version is inferior etc. etc. etc. Sorry people, but this is totally besides the point. What matters is whether this version works or not(in my opinion it totally does) and not whow it fares in comparison.2. Lots of reviewers talk about plotholes and unanswered questions (most of them without mentioning even where these plotholes are and why they consider them ""holes"" to begin with)...Uhm, sorry again, but maybe you didn't notice that this is a film about the paranormal???? And, as such, it is by definition ""allowed"" NOT to follow your understanding of reality??? If it did, it would then have to do with something other than the peranormal! Comprende?Ok, onto the film then. Needless to tell more about the story, it's been written in full detail by many others.The Ring is the first thriller-horror film in a long while that has a superb storyline, a brilliant script, and very good to stunning acting performances as well as a great directorial effort.Even though there have been recent great films in the genre (notably The Sixth Sense and The Others) the Ring goes one step further because of its frantic pace that doesnt let up for a single minute. That's a paradox really, and simoultaneously the Ring's claim to greatness  because as you see it creates the impression that it's rather slow, but, there's constantly clues added as you watch, constantly the story evolves and the film doesnt sag at all at any given point.On top of that, there are so many ingenius ideas that work to the benefit of the whole plot (the fly that comes alive through the screen, the tape lacking a number print, and of course the fact that it's a paranormal story which finds its outlet through modern technology).The doom-ladden atmosphere is devoid of banality, particualarly the island setting in the film and the brilliant use of the murky weather backround, but overall the director has seriously worked on intimidating the viewers without resorting to cheap ""boo!"" tactics.Sequences like the one on the ferry with the horse that goes wild will stay on peoples' minds for a long time but the Ring is actually full of disturbing optics that you keep with you long after you've exited the movie theater. The curse-carrying tape on its own is nothing short of an art-piece, surely one that will (hopefully) inspire more films in that direction.Extra kudos for the casting of the film: the kid is a return to the 60s faces in the genre with its almost possesed look in his eyes, as is the girl herself with her tragic grimace, but where the film could have blown it and -thankfully- didn't is with the use of the ""beautiful blonde"" but she does an admittedly very good job in her part and contribution as does everybody in the Ring in general.Not since the Shining (and that over 2 decades ago) have i come across a thriller that kept me edged throughout as this one did. That, i think, is a heavy compliment to this flick. The Ring is not to be missed by fans of the horror-thriller scene or by viewers who like intelligent well made films no matter what the genre.Another thing that should be pointed out, is that Ring is also an allegory on television, or rather, becomes one whether it's intended to or not. At one point the reporter is standing on her balcony having a panoramic view in other apartment buldings and what their inhabitants are doing inside and sees everywhere a switched on television set. That, along with the fact that evil chooses to use the TV set as its entrance to our world is indicative of what i mean. But, it's not merely indicative, unless you -somehow- think that TV is NOT evil.....Instant classic.",5,Instant classic: a story from the other side,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,3899,"['couple', 'notes', 'thoughts', 'film:1', 'ongoing', 'barrage', 'comments', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'people', 'saying', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Ringu', 'better', 'more', 'subtle', 'should', 'see', 'one', 'first', 'American', 'version', 'inferior', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Sorry', 'people', 'totally', 'point', 'What', 'version', 'not', 'opinion', 'totally', 'not', 'whow', 'comparison.2', 'Lots', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'plotholes', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'most', 'mentioning', 'even', 'where', 'plotholes', 'are', 'why', 'consider', 'holes', 'begin', 'Uhm', 'sorry', 'again', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'film', 'paranormal', 'such', 'definition', 'allowed', 'NOT', 'follow', 'understanding', 'reality', 'did', 'would', 'then', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'other', 'peranormal', 'Comprende', 'Ok', 'film', 'then', 'Needless', 'tell', 'more', 'story', 'been', 'written', 'full', 'detail', 'many', 'others.The', 'Ring', 'first', 'thriller-horror', 'film', 'long', 'while', 'superb', 'storyline', 'brilliant', 'script', 'very', 'good', 'stunning', 'acting', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'directorial', 'effort.Even', 'have', 'been', 'recent', 'great', 'films', 'genre', 'notably', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Others', 'Ring', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'frantic', 'pace', 'doesnt', 'let', 'up', 'single', 'minute', 'paradox', 'really', 'simoultaneously', 'Ring', 'claim', 'greatness', 'because', 'see', 'impression', 'rather', 'slow', 'constantly', 'added', 'watch', 'constantly', 'story', 'evolves', 'film', 'doesnt', 'sag', 'given', 'point.On', 'top', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ingenius', 'ideas', 'work', 'benefit', 'whole', 'plot', 'fly', 'alive', 'screen', 'tape', 'lacking', 'number', 'print', 'course', 'fact', 'paranormal', 'story', 'outlet', 'modern', 'technology', '.The', 'doom-ladden', 'atmosphere', 'devoid', 'banality', 'particualarly', 'island', 'setting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'use', 'murky', 'weather', 'backround', 'director', 'seriously', 'worked', 'intimidating', 'viewers', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'boo', 'tactics.Sequences', 'one', 'ferry', 'horse', 'wild', 'will', 'stay', 'peoples', 'minds', 'long', 'time', 'Ring', 'actually', 'full', 'disturbing', 'optics', 'keep', 'long', ""'ve"", 'exited', 'movie', 'theater', 'curse-carrying', 'tape', 'own', 'nothing', 'short', 'art-piece', 'surely', 'one', 'will', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'more', 'films', 'direction.Extra', 'kudos', 'casting', 'film', 'kid', 'return', '60s', 'genre', 'almost', 'possesed', 'look', 'eyes', 'girl', 'tragic', 'grimace', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'blown', '-thankfully-', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'admittedly', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'contribution', 'everybody', 'Ring', 'general.Not', 'Shining', '2', 'decades', 'ago', 'have', 'i', 'come', 'thriller', 'kept', 'edged', 'one', 'did', 'i', 'think', 'heavy', 'compliment', 'flick', 'Ring', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'fans', 'horror-thriller', 'scene', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'intelligent', 'well', 'made', 'films', 'matter', 'what', 'genre.Another', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Ring', 'also', 'allegory', 'television', 'rather', 'one', 'intended', 'not', 'one', 'point', 'reporter', 'standing', 'balcony', 'having', 'panoramic', 'view', 'other', 'apartment', 'buldings', 'what', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'doing', 'sees', 'everywhere', 'switched', 'television', 'set', 'fact', 'evil', 'chooses', 'use', 'TV', 'set', 'entrance', 'world', 'indicative', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'not', 'merely', 'indicative', '-somehow-', 'think', 'TV', 'NOT', 'evil', '..Instant', 'classic']",N/A

And by the way, the Japanese version (based on a book, which is even MORE different yet) is unavailable currently in the states, despite being four years old (Which is not ""a long time ago"" as one other reviewer thought).First of all, Ringu, the Japanese original is available on DVD (although to be fair, I don't think it was when this review was written).  And, to me, downloading an entire feature length film seems more ridiculous than getting yourself a region free DVD player.  And I think a ""long time ago"" is very subjective.  If someone last took a shower a ""long time ago"" then four years does apply.  And depending on the way someone sees movies, or is discussing a grouping of films, then four years could be a ""long time ago.""--- ""I then saw this. What a mistake. This remake (would be more appropriate considering their choice to hide the fact that it is based on a far superior Japanese film) is terrible; unnecessary and laughable additions were made and much of interest was dropped (like, those character thingies, who are like people. but who needs any sense of real characters anyway?) such as the ability to use REAL suspense and SUBTLETY in favor of cheap shocks that weren't even shocking.""Uhhh, to each his own, here I guess.  Except that I'm unaware of the remake trying to hide the fact that it was a remake.  I have not seen the original yet -- I should point that out.  And there's a good chance that I'll much prefer it to the remake.  But just because a film you love is remade into a lesser work, that doesn't really make it awful and terrible, etc.--- ""Acting was...awful. I expected better of Naomi Watts, and knew nothing of the rest (except for the fact that they were in a relatively successful film now, I wouldn't expect to see much more of them either).""This was my biggest complaint, most of the acting was fine, the kid was good, and Naomi Watts was outstanding.  In this review there seems a tendency to denounce everything about the film, because it was not liked.  But Naomi Watts was great here, and once or twice she screams so cinematically wonderful that I really think it's the best scream I've ever seen in a movie.I actually give this film three and one-half stars but had to round up to four.  It's similar in style and mood, if not story, to The Others -- and it's obviously influenced by the success of that film.  The Ring is also not as good as The Others.I compare it to The Others because they are similar types of films (even though the actual plots are nothing alike). Plus this film stars the amazing actress Naomi Watts, who is famously best friends with Nicole Kidman -- star of The Others.What happens is you watch a videotape. Immediately after you get a phone call -- someone tells you you have 7 days to live. Then, of course, you die. So Naomi hears about this and tries to figure out what's going on (she's a journalist). There are plot holes; but the film has a neat, cold look and atmosphere. Naomi Watts is remarkable.I still think that her performance in Mulholland Drive is, like, one of the greatest film performances of all time.

606695,A3E8OD9EKMMDEJ,B00005JLTK,"The Game ""B""","[0, 0]","The Ring is an engrossing horror movie that will have you at the edge of your seats from beginning to end.Storyline- The storyline of the Ring is basically a deadly tape where if you watch it you get a call saying you will die in seven days. One lady named Susan (played by Naomi Watts) decides that she will watch it (although i'm not sure why) and now she has seven days to find a way to stop the effect of the tape and destroy it along with her husband Noah (played by Martin Henderson) and young son Aidan.I thought the storyline of The Ring was a little bit simplistic. I think they could have made it quite a bit more complicated as the director Gore Verbinski could have done a better job, but however it was very entertaining and well done.One other thing about The Ring that i didn't like that much is that random things kept happening. I know they must have had something to do with the story, but i did not like these random appearences by something like a centipedede. (as in the bug) Or for example she sees a centipede and her nose starts bleeding. Alrighty then!But for the most part the storyline was hardly an issue and no reason why i shouldn't give this movie 5/5.Acting/script- When you usually hear about these kinds of horror movies, you do not really expect the acting/script to be that great, just the special effects/how much it scares you. However i thought that The Ring was very well done in terms of acting/script. You can really tell in this movie what the character is feeling whether it is joy/horror/excitement. They show much emotion by the way they are acting and the way that they are talking. They even did a good job with Aidan and the way that he acted and talked. They way that the haunted girl moved and spoke was very creepy as well.Special effects- Ahhh, definetetly one of the best parts of the movie has to be the special effects. Gore Verbinski definetely knew what he wanted in terms of effects in this movie. I think the top two parts in the movie that were best in terms of special effects has to be when they open the closet out of nowhere and there is that scary/demented/rotten face just sitting there with that freaky glare. Also, when the girl starts coming out of the tv, that is very scary/well done as well.The actual video tape in The Ring is very scary, how it is acted. Random things keep happening (im talking about the actual videotape that they watch) which make it very scary. I was expecting something very cheesy, but boy, was i wrong.In conclusion, Gore Verbinski and all of the actors sure succeeded in putting together and masterpiece and one of a kind horror movie. There is hardly any action scenes in this movie, but i find that the horror movies with no action are the better ones in the most part.",5,One of the best horror movies i've seen in ages!,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2771,"['Ring', 'engrossing', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seats', 'beginning', 'end.Storyline-', 'storyline', 'Ring', 'basically', 'deadly', 'tape', 'where', 'watch', 'get', 'call', 'saying', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'One', 'lady', 'named', 'Susan', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'will', 'watch', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'now', 'seven', 'days', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'effect', 'tape', 'destroy', 'along', 'husband', 'Noah', 'played', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'young', 'son', 'Aidan.I', 'thought', 'storyline', 'Ring', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well', 'done.One', 'other', 'thing', 'Ring', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'random', 'things', 'kept', 'happening', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'story', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'random', 'appearences', 'something', 'centipedede', 'bug', 'example', 'centipede', 'nose', 'starts', 'bleeding', 'Alrighty', 'then', 'most', 'part', 'storyline', 'was', 'hardly', 'issue', 'reason', 'why', 'i', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '5/5.Acting/script-', 'When', 'usually', 'hear', 'kinds', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'expect', 'acting/script', 'be', 'great', 'just', 'special', 'effects/how', 'much', 'However', 'i', 'thought', 'Ring', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'acting/script', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'movie', 'what', 'character', 'feeling', 'joy/horror/excitement', 'show', 'much', 'emotion', 'way', 'are', 'acting', 'way', 'are', 'talking', 'even', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Aidan', 'way', 'acted', 'talked', 'way', 'haunted', 'girl', 'moved', 'spoke', 'was', 'very', 'creepy', 'well.Special', 'effects-', 'Ahhh', 'definetetly', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'be', 'special', 'effects', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'definetely', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'terms', 'effects', 'movie', 'think', 'top', 'two', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'best', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'when', 'open', 'closet', 'nowhere', 'scary/demented/rotten', 'face', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'freaky', 'glare', 'Also', 'when', 'girl', 'coming', 'tv', 'very', 'scary/well', 'done', 'well.The', 'actual', 'video', 'tape', 'Ring', 'very', 'scary', 'how', 'acted', 'Random', 'things', 'keep', 'happening', 'im', 'talking', 'actual', 'videotape', 'watch', 'make', 'very', 'scary', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'very', 'cheesy', 'boy', 'was', 'i', 'wrong.In', 'conclusion', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'actors', 'sure', 'succeeded', 'putting', 'together', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'hardly', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'i', 'find', 'horror', 'movies', 'action', 'are', 'better', 'ones', 'most', 'part']",N/A

Director Gore Verbinksi (no pun intended) is a hidden gem with this film before his supreme success with ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.  Naomi Watts stars in a breakthrough role as a single parent/news reporter who learns of the mysterious death of a family member.  Personally charged to get answers concerning the grisly aftermath and occupationally energized to bring her findings onto the television screen, Rachel Keller (Watts) dives deeper and deeper into secrets of a video tape that is causing all of this horror.  When her investigation brings her small son (the creepy youngster Dorfman) and her ex-lover (Henderson) into the mix, Rachel must solve the mystery and save her loved ones before it's too late.An excellent, intelligent screenplay by Kruger is projected onto the big screen in a deliciously scary manner.  The film is not overly violent (although you would believe otherwise due to the director's name), but uses atmosphere and tension to create its scares, rather than campy blood and guts.  Watts is very strong in the starring role, showing some cinematic range and displaying a set of lungs that may end up rivaling none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the twentieth century has brought on a barrage of disrespected, simple-minded, and ridiculous horror films, ""The Ring"" shines above the rest as a solid adventure into a new scope of the genre and succeeds mightily due to its superb direction and cinematography.  Lots of jolts and jumps, as well as one hell of a creepy videotape.  One of the best horror films of the decade thus far.

Bacon ""TJB""","[5, 9]","In BriefIt sounded like just another urban legend: a videotape filled with nightmarish images, leading to a phone call foretelling the viewer's death in exactly seven days. As a newspaper reporter, Rachel Keller (Watts) was naturally sceptical of the story, until four teenagers all met with mysterious deaths exactly one week after watching just such a tape. Allowing her investigative curiosity to get the better of her, Rachel tracks down the video, and watching now has just seven days herself to unravel the mystery of the Ring.ReviewSo much money has been thrown at redeveloping an original concept into this remake that I was nearly fooled into thinking this was a good film.  It is the perfect example of how a low budget original can never EVER be beaten.  There appears, as is the case here, a constant desire by American filmmakers to spell everything out: ""Oh, and if the original wasn't very clear, that won't matter as we'll change the plot anyway!""  This isn't to say that there isn't a fragment of the original left.  In fact there are many recognisable moments that have been given the polish and sheen requirements of an easy to swallow pill.While there may be little to choke on for those Stateside there is plenty on offer to stick in the throat, especially for purest fans of the original Japanese cult hit.  Biggest amongst these factors is the dreadfully hammy acting by Naomi Watts who never fails to give the impression that she is more concerned with getting her `good-side' profile on camera than any of that tiresome acting that can obviously be such a drag!  This is not to say that she is making a pigs ear from a perfectly silky script, as the dialogue on offer wins hands down as some of the worst committed to film in recent times.In some twist of desperation to make `their' version of The Ring we have the inclusion of horses to the plot, making for a fairly poor variation on the defunct concept that animals sense things we humans can't.  It does however provide one flawlessly executed sequence upon a car ferry that is both original and disturbing.  With visual references to both The Shining and Rear Window, one senses that this is a filmmaker clutching to all his `good' ideas, throwing them at the original classic and using whatever sticks.The VerdictThere is a definite visual flair to the makeup of The Ring by the ex-commercial filmmaker; but alas digital editing, jump and subliminal cuts do not make a film alone.

Well, if you haven't, you should listen and listen well because it works like a survival guide in this static empire we call entertainment. Dismissed as an urban legend by some, it showcases the fact that there is actually something that preys upon people that are caught unaware and this thing, it isn't like you or me. It doesn't care who it harms or if you meant to watch it at all, only wanting you to figure out what the tale it tells is before you see the ring. If you don't, well. We begin with a tale of four teenagers spending time in a cabin located amidst postcard scenery, all of them partying and enjoying themselves while taking time to be in the arms of the people they love. Everything seems to be perfect, too, until something happens. While trying to record a football game, they picked up something strange, a broadcast that they never wanted to witness, and then they made the innocent mistake of watching it while trying to see the match-up they taped. Soon afterward, they receive a phone call that tells them that they would die in seven days. Thinking that this was something of a joke (or at least dismissing it as such), the four teenagers began seeing things with their inner eyes, dreaming lexicons of vividly nightmarish dreams, and on the seventh night, well. And thus it beings.As far as the mingling dread and cinematic visions goes, The Ring was an impressively crafted blanket of both moods and ideas, forging a tale around a haunting legend about what happens when evil truly has a tale to tell. From indentions of the atmospheric to mooding set by the candlelight of dread, the story itself propels onward and makes its viewers pay attention, demanding that the audience keeps its eyes forward at all times in order to understand what is taking place. It isn't a table set with little creatures eerily yelling ""boo"" every now and again either, but is instead a work that manifests itself as one piece, coming together to leave a chilling impression in the spine of those who watch it. The horror within it, although buried, sometimes peeks out and says that it is watching its watchers, making use of cryptic visualizations that are haunting morbid and that demand that you remember them. And remember them you will, because the presentation of the idea is nothing if not scarring. This is furthered by a cast that is actually believable, a feat in and of itself in modern movies, and by the fact that this is not a movie with a happy ending. In fact, the ending of this, well, it leaves enough question marks open to let the viewer think thoughts of doom each and every time they reflect back, knowing that the beastly could always come and say hello. (And the short piece included is like this as well, making it all the more frightening when the exclamation point is added to that retelling).If you are a fan of the genre and you like your plots thought out, then this is a movie that I would highly recommend. Statements proclaiming that this movie didn't make sense are absurd and without merit, and people that say that it didn't set an atmosphere obviously need to upgrade their senses a notch or two. Perhaps, with a fair number of distractions, the movie could be ruined and perhaps, with the wrong setting, the effect wouldn't be as well noted. Still, turning off the lights and sitting in the darkness, letting the little chills walking the stairwell of your back, works well with this piece because it has the ability to be haunting. Many tales, they are scary, but few tales can actually evoke a feeling of dread. To me, movies like The Ring are what tuning in are all about.",5,"Well, It Isn't About the Hola Hoop!",1052092800,"05 5, 2003",2003,3703,"['Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'story', 'tape', 'kills', 'when', 'watch', 'Well', 'have', ""n't"", 'should', 'listen', 'listen', 'well', 'survival', 'guide', 'static', 'empire', 'call', 'entertainment', 'Dismissed', 'urban', 'legend', 'fact', 'actually', 'something', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'unaware', 'thing', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'meant', 'watch', 'only', 'wanting', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'tale', 'see', 'ring', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'begin', 'tale', 'four', 'teenagers', 'spending', 'time', 'cabin', 'located', 'amidst', 'postcard', 'scenery', 'partying', 'enjoying', 'taking', 'time', 'be', 'arms', 'people', 'love', 'Everything', 'be', 'perfect', 'too', 'something', 'happens', 'trying', 'record', 'football', 'game', 'picked', 'up', 'something', 'strange', 'broadcast', 'never', 'wanted', 'witness', 'then', 'made', 'innocent', 'mistake', 'watching', 'trying', 'see', 'match-up', 'taped', 'Soon', 'afterward', 'receive', 'phone', 'call', 'would', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'Thinking', 'was', 'something', 'joke', 'least', 'dismissing', 'such', 'four', 'teenagers', 'began', 'seeing', 'things', 'inner', 'eyes', 'dreaming', 'lexicons', 'vividly', 'nightmarish', 'dreams', 'seventh', 'night', 'well', 'thus', 'far', 'mingling', 'dread', 'cinematic', 'visions', 'Ring', 'was', 'impressively', 'crafted', 'blanket', 'moods', 'ideas', 'forging', 'tale', 'haunting', 'legend', 'what', 'when', 'evil', 'truly', 'tale', 'tell', 'indentions', 'atmospheric', 'mooding', 'set', 'candlelight', 'dread', 'story', 'onward', 'viewers', 'pay', 'attention', 'demanding', 'audience', 'eyes', 'forward', 'times', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'taking', 'place', ""n't"", 'table', 'set', 'little', 'creatures', 'eerily', 'yelling', 'boo', 'now', 'again', 'either', 'instead', 'work', 'one', 'piece', 'coming', 'together', 'leave', 'chilling', 'impression', 'spine', 'who', 'watch', 'horror', 'buried', 'sometimes', 'out', 'watching', 'watchers', 'making', 'use', 'cryptic', 'visualizations', 'are', 'haunting', 'morbid', 'demand', 'remember', 'remember', 'will', 'presentation', 'idea', 'nothing', 'not', 'scarring', 'furthered', 'cast', 'actually', 'believable', 'feat', 'modern', 'movies', 'fact', 'not', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'fact', 'ending', 'well', 'enough', 'question', 'marks', 'open', 'let', 'viewer', 'think', 'thoughts', 'doom', 'time', 'reflect', 'back', 'knowing', 'beastly', 'could', 'always', 'come', 'say', 'hello', 'short', 'piece', 'included', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'more', 'frightening', 'when', 'exclamation', 'point', 'added', 'retelling', '.If', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'plots', 'thought', 'out', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Statements', 'proclaiming', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'absurd', 'merit', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'atmosphere', 'obviously', 'need', 'upgrade', 'senses', 'notch', 'two', 'Perhaps', 'fair', 'number', 'distractions', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'ruined', 'perhaps', 'wrong', 'setting', 'effect', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'well', 'noted', 'Still', 'turning', 'off', 'lights', 'sitting', 'darkness', 'letting', 'little', 'chills', 'walking', 'stairwell', 'back', 'well', 'piece', 'ability', 'be', 'haunting', 'Many', 'tales', 'are', 'scary', 'few', 'tales', 'can', 'actually', 'evoke', 'feeling', 'dread', 'movies', 'Ring', 'are', 'what', 'tuning', 'are']",N/A

It was undoubtedly the creepiest, and I'm one that's not easily frightened.  The story is based on the premise that there's an urban legend about a video tape, that after being viewed, gives the viewer only ""seven days"" to live.  This message of impending doom is eerily spoken  by a young girl's voice in a telephone call that rings immediately after the tape is watched.  It turns out that a teenage girl watched this tape, and seven days later, she dies from her heart just stopping, and the most horrible look of terror is frozen on her face.  The girl is a niece of a Seattle reporter that, at the bequest of the girl's mother (her sister), begins researching the cause of the girl's heart just stopping, which ""no doctor can explain.""  She discovers the urban legend and the tape surrounding it.  What follows is a masterpiece of thrills and scares that have been so artfully done by the cinematographers, director, musical composer, and all those involved in the creation of this movie, that I think it should be a classic.  We eventually see just how the girl died at the end of the film, and it is so frightening a scene, it will truly explain the frozen look of horror on the girl's corpse.  This scene is worth the movie alone, even if the rest of the film was more subtle and not as bone chilling, it would be worth it just for this piece of film making.The reporter, Rachel Keller, embarks on a dark journey that would chill the bones of the toughest of people.  The cursed tape itself has mysterious, surreal images of people, places, and incoherent things, including a glowing ring.  Based on these clues, she is led to a small island town where a child named Samara mysteriously disappeared 23 years earlier, but no one knows where she truly went, nor from where she really came.  All that is known is that the girl was supposedly adopted, but we get a clue from a comment from the father and a birth certificate that this child may have been born ala ""Rosemary's Baby"" or in some other mysterious way.  All we know is that her adoptive mother went mad and committed suicide, as well as the horses she bred as her livelihood.  The town's psychiatrist, played wonderfully by a stoic Jane Alexander, infers that this child had demonic powers by stating that when Samara left, ""things got better.""  The doctor treated Samara's mother, who claimed to have strange and horrible visions that ""burned inside of her,"" and they only occurred when she was around Samara.  Rachel is on a race to get to the bottom of this because not only she, but now her young son, has accidentally viewed the tape.  Her son is a boy that Samara ""talks"" to and gives some visions.  Samara not only ""haunted"" people when she was alive, but it is found out that she died an unspeakably horrible death, and I'm surmising that out of blind hatred and anger, she continues to haunt people with horrible visions and she uses modern technology to kill them as well.There has been much ado about videotapes and that the advent of that technology was not around when Samara was alive.  However, I gather that she continued to ""live"" even after death because it is noted that she ""never sleeps."" This fact was noted throughout much of the later half of the movie.  She never really died, except physically, and she uses the most common medium of our culture to send her deadly message.  As a child, she could only send these images in drawings and in her mind, but after death, she found a more perfect and widespread way to get her message across.  You will never want to be alone with a television again after watching this engrossing and bone chilling film.",5,Does for TV&#65533;s what Psycho did for Showers!!

It's a psychological thriller and scary movie and mystery in one. There are symbols and clues and some VERY freaky moments. The scariest? I dare you not to be afraid when Samara climbs out of the well and comes through Noah's TV and gets him. Come on. It's sheer terror. This movie was very well-made and it's a great story. Right from the beginning you've got scariness. The kid, Aidan, is scary. Everything in the tape is scary. The way it ends (as though YOU'RE next because YOU watched the tape) is scary. And clever.I did enjoy &quot;The Ring&quot; immensely. When people told me they literally could not sleep for days after seeing it, THEY WERE NOT KIDDING. Wait'll you find out just what &quot;the ring&quot; is. It's a great movie. But in case I haven't stressed it enough, it's verrrry scary. I suggest you watch it with company and a pet, a pillow, a blanket...some popcorn maybe...and turn out the lights...",5,THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE.,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,2523,"['what', 'axe-wielding', 'psychopath', 'who', 'two', 'hours', 'chasing', 'stupid', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'perpetually', 'wrong', 'direction', 'movie', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'freaky', 'mystery', ""'ve"", 'got', 'brain', 'can', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'eerie', 'people', 'scenery', 'symbols', 'events', 'give', 'thrill', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'guaranteed', 'scare', 'Alot', 'course', 'even', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'meet', 'criteria', ""'ll"", 'still', 'scare', 'anyway', 'Maybe', 'more', ""'ll"", 'haunt', 'afterward', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'seven', 'days', 'TV', 'turn', 'see', 'horrifying', 'images', 'video', 'OK', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'story', 'away', 'VERY', 'SCARY', 'watched', 'movie', 'dark', 'was', 'creepiest', 'thing', 'not', 'childrens', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'maybe', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'get', 'point', 'too', 'was', 'bothered', 'horse', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Humane', 'Society', 'monitored', 'set', 'saw', 'animal', 'was', 'harmed', 'do', 'almsot', 'movies', 'especially', 'big', 'ones', ""'m"", 'sure', 'camera', 'tricks', 'computers', 'were', 'employed', 'help', 'make', 'look', 'as', 'bad', 'seemed', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'convinced', 'horse', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'hurt', 'just', 'film', 'shot.', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'scariest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'alot', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'quot', 'Omen', 'quot', 'quot', 'Friday', '13th', 'quot', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'last', 'summer', 'quot', ""'re"", 'good', 'one', 'different', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'scary', 'movie', 'mystery', 'one', 'are', 'symbols', 'clues', 'VERY', 'freaky', 'moments', 'scariest', 'dare', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'when', 'Samara', 'well', 'Noah', 'TV', 'Come', 'sheer', 'terror', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well-made', 'great', 'story', 'Right', 'beginning', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scariness', 'kid', 'Aidan', 'scary', 'Everything', 'tape', 'scary', 'way', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'next', 'YOU', 'watched', 'tape', 'scary', 'clever.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'immensely', 'When', 'people', 'told', 'literally', 'could', 'not', 'sleep', 'days', 'seeing', 'THEY', 'WERE', 'NOT', 'KIDDING', 'Wait', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'quot', 'ring', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'stressed', 'enough', 'verrrry', 'scary', 'suggest', 'watch', 'company', 'pet', 'pillow', 'blanket', 'popcorn', 'maybe', 'turn', 'out', 'lights']",N/A

People who watch a video tape die within seven days of viewing it. Ok, pretty dumb premise, but I've seen worse. I've got an open mind. Especially whens it comes to horror movies. Next, great image of a girl who gets scared to death. Very chilling. Very cool. Now we get to see what's on the tape. Extremely gothic images in jump cut. Wow, fantastic production values. Now, I'm intrigued. I think, we may be in for something special. But, instead I'm taken on an investigation into the history of a little girl who's making all this happen. How? Why? What? Why did the horse jump off the boat? Why did this girl get killed? Her father doesn't want her and that gives Mommy Dearest the impetus to kill her? Huh? The little girl is making videos with her ghostly mind to kill people? What for? Revenge? Against who?...........Against me for watching this movie all the way through. Who cares? I didn't. But if I was bankrolling this, I'd sure be asking these questions. But it just shows to go ya, Hollywood can lay any kind of pooh pooh and people will pay to see it. I know I did. And over 500 people reviewed it. Now, if I can just stop one person from seeing this.....Hollywood justs seems to be sinking deeper and deeper with this genre. Whomever wrote this Screenplay should be forced to watch their own creation over and over, eyeballs open, ala Clockwork Orange, for eternity. That would be worse than what happened to the characters who watched the fatal tape in this movie. Oops, I called it a movie. Sorry. What really insulted my intelligence was the pretension of the film makers. Too much Drama going nowhere. If you got no story, bombard me with special effects. I can take it. Did anyone else notice VIDEODROME?Even though flicks in this genre hardly ever have one, a decent payoff is in order. Beware!! This one has the worst denouement in recent memory.

Not the Omen, not Excorsist, not The Shining. Those films have nothing on the creepiness that this film possesses. Now, I have not seen the original, but I hear from different people that they find that one better, and some, find the remake better. I guess it doesn't really matter. They are probably both pretty intense. Naomi Watts does a fantastic job as a petrified woman trying to stop something horrible from happening. Of course, she doesn't realise what that entails. The look of the film is one of foreboding. At every turn, in every scene. It must be the hue, its this murky bluish grey, and it surrounds the entire film. You never know what to expect. The beginning of the film is awesome, and the end is the most disturbing, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I cannot look at a well the same way anymore. The infamous tape that is in the movie, while not really scary, it is pretty disturbing. I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well. Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.  I still would not really categorize this as a horror film. Its more of a suspense thriller.

It is so weird and chilling that it kept my fearless 17 year old brother up at night.  Well I don't know about frightening but it was a weird movie.The RIng starts off like any horror movie with a teenage victim.  The girl Katie watched the video with three friends and within a week they all die.  After that her Aunt Rachel goes out to solve the mystery.  She ends up finding the tape and watching it.  She now has a week to solve it.  As the mystery dwells deeper into the tale of a family with a bad misfortune many years ago and the stranger mystery of their daughter leading to a chilling finale, if not a little over done.Now for the biggest complaint. When my brother first saw this it immediatly reminded him of Silent Hill (Most chilling Playstation game ever) and how at the time of it's release it was so dark and freaky that we couldn't play it in the dark.  Well like any gutsy horror fan I watched this in the dark, in it's entirty.  I wasn't afraid once.  Disturbed once or twice, but not frightened.  I also got the feeling that it was released shortly after Fear Dot Com because in many ways the two movies were similar.  Obviously this one was better made.  Also the ending was way drawn out (By ending I mean the Jumper FInale that is in all Horror Films).  However past that you have a very solid horror film that is surprisingly PG-13.

Verbinski's previous films (Mouse Hunt and The Mexican) demonstrated his skill as a film director but nothing hinted at his ability to handle this film. I've noticed quite a few comments about how confusing the film's conclusion seems. There's always unanswered questions in the best thrillers (Kubrick's much maligned The Shining or Freidkin's The Exorcist are two good examples). Verbinski and his American collaborators focus on a what appears to be a streamlined narrative but really had more twists and turns than is at first hinted at.The plot has been well summarized already but for the sake of this review I'll provide a thumbnail sketch; There's a video floating out there that, urban legend has it, will kill you 7 days after you've watched it. A reporter's niece is dies horribly after having accidently watched it with some friends (all of her friends died as well). She decides to investigate and watches it herself in the process. After watching it she, like all the victims, gets a call from a little girl that tells her she has 7 days to live. The timeframe and tragedy associated with the video spurs her on to find out who is behind the video and why innocents are dying. In the process, she unwittingly opens up a supernatural pandora's box.The jumpy editing, spooky cinematography and strong performances all enhance the film making it almost a sequel to the original Japanese classic. Since most sequels are remakes trying to recapture lightening anyway, Verbinski works in visual references to both the original film and other classic horror films in an attempt to make this more than your standardized American remake of a sucessful foreign film..... The Ring is an intelligent, forceful thriller that doesn't overload us with gore. Instead, it focuses on the ""suspense"" angle. We, as the audience, know what's going to happen to some extend.

Katie died suddenly of unknown causes while at home with her best friend, who was so freaked out by whatever happened that night that she is now in a psychiatric ward. Rachels learns from some of Katie's other friends that there's supposed to be some video tape that causes the death of anyone who watches it exactly seven days later. She is compelled to look into it further when she learns that three other teenagers all died mysteriously on the same night and at the same time as Katie.THE RING is a good supernatural thriller and an improvement on the Japanese original, RINGU. Director Verbinski demonstrates that he knows how to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Editing, sound and some unconventional film techniques are used to raise the creep-out factor to high level. The story is told from Rachel's point of view and she brings the appropriate skepticism about the allegedly cursed video tape. Watts plays the character with intelligence and just the right level of fear to be believable. It's not until after she has viewed the nightmarish tape that the truth of the legend becomes undeniable; Rachel is now in a race to make sense of what she has seen before her seven days are up. The only weakness of the screenplay is that when the source of the evil is revealed, it's somewhat unsatisfying because it leaves you thinking that there must be more to it than that.Of special note is a hidden feature on the DVD menu.

The story centers on a video tape that when watched, will find the viewer dead in exactly 7 days time.  Naomi Watts plays a Seattle reporter who investigates the death of her niece, a victim of said video tape.  When Naomi watches the tape the countdown to her own death begins.  What follows is her search to uncover the mystery of the tape to save her life as well as her son's and her estranged boyfriend.  The road leads to a frightening little girl with supernatural powers named Samara.  I understand there is a Japanese sequel that fleshes out the story of Samara.  Based on how well this movie did, I would guess we may get a remake of that sequel as well.The movie is full of disturbing and unsettling images.  The atmosphere is kept ""cold"" and dark throughout.  In my opinion, it is difficult to make a movie that's actually scary.  So many things have been done before.  The Ring succeeds in doing something different.  I got more than my share of chills while watching this movie.The DVD transfer is stunning.  The subdued colors of the rainy Seattle days look great.  The sound track has both Dolby 5.1 and dts.  The dts track was so clear it sounded as if it was actually raining in my room.  The extras are limited to a couple of trailers (including one for the DVD of the original film, Ringu) and a short film which is really a series of deleted and alternate scenes.

606725,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JLTK,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""The Ring"" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), ""The Ring"" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. ""The Ring"" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's ""The Grudge"" and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of ""The Ring"" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent ""From Within"" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of ""The Ring."" Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B",4,The mysterious atmosphere makes this film,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1929,"['Ring', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', '2002', 'American', 'remake', '1998', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Ringu', 'turn', 'was', 'based', '1991', 'book', 'story', 'around', 'VHS', 'tape', 'cursed', 'whoever', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'reporter', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'wind', 'video', 'sense', 'curse', 'real', 'tries', 'find', 'answer.Shot', 'mostly', 'Washington', 'state', 'parts', 'Oregon', 'California', 'Ring', 'polished', 'film', 'nice', 'haunting', 'vibe', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'thick', 'forests', 'constant', 'rain', 'Watts', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'are', 'worthy', 'protagonists', 'well.Unfortunately', 'back', 'story', 'ghostly', 'girl', 'convoluted', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'unexplained', 'Why', 'do', 'horses', 'go', 'nuts', 'two', 'occasions', 'Why', 'little', 'girl', 'evil', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'chronology', 'back-story', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'maybe', 'answers', 'are', 'there', 'rack', 'brains', ""'ll"", 'do', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'film.Another', 'positive', 'ghostly', 'element', 'actually', 'rather', 'chilling', 'important', 'ghost', 'flicks', 'normally', 'what', 'can', 'immaterial', 'ghost', 'do', 'anyway', 'Not', 'much', 'maybe', 'make', 'objects', 'fly', 'whirlwind', 'negative', 'energy', 'what', 'be', 'scared', ""'re"", 'dead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'significant', 'harm', 'Ring', 'effectively', 'apparition', 'frightful', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'followed', 'suit', '2004', 'Grudge', 'sequels.Speaking', 'subsequent', 'films', 'many', 'have', 'taken', 'elements', 'Ring', 'made', 'better', 'films', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'instance', 'excellent', 'Within', '2008', 'hard', 'beat', 'mysterious', 'ambiance', 'Ring', 'complain', 'one', 'two', 'false', 'endings', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'end', 'revealing', 'killed', 'girl', 'opening', 'teaser.The', 'film', '115', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

Over in Japan, though, their horror is much more dark and symbolic.  ""The Ring"" (an adaptation of the Japanese ""Ringu"") brings that cinematic style over here.For a basic plot summary, ""The Ring"" introduces a video tape that, when watched, will result in the viewer getting a phone call telling them they will die in seven days...which is usually exactly what happens.  However, when the tape is seen by a journalist (Naomi Watts) and inadvertently by her son, they become engaged in a race against the clock to try and decipher the tape's mysterious imagery and the real story behind the ring.The dark, disturbing imagery in this film is really what makes it a horror stand-out.  Since we are accustomed to more in-your-face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying.  The young girl with the straight hair over her eyes, the well, the dead horses, and the horrifying faces of the tape's victims all add up to a cornucopia of disturbing images.""The Ring"" is also an exercise in the cerebral.  Not all the answers are given up front or thrown in the viewers' face.  Instead, we are forced to evaluate all the imagery and subtle clues to piece things together.  To paraphrase Hitchcock, what we don't know/see is often scarier than the obvious.Overall, I consider ""The Ring"" to be a seminal horror film for fans of the genre (right up there with Halloween and Saw).  Given the chance, I would have bumped the star-rating up to 4.5.",4,Bringing Japanese Horror Stateside,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1596,"['Here', 'United', 'States', 'horror', 'movie', 'culture', 'defined', 'mask-wearing', 'knife-wielding', 'psychos', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'Vorhees', 'Japan', 'though', 'horror', 'much', 'more', 'dark', 'symbolic', 'Ring', 'adaptation', 'Japanese', 'Ringu', 'cinematic', 'style', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Ring', 'video', 'tape', 'when', 'watched', 'will', 'result', 'viewer', 'getting', 'phone', 'call', 'telling', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'usually', 'exactly', 'what', 'However', 'when', 'tape', 'seen', 'journalist', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'inadvertently', 'son', 'become', 'engaged', 'race', 'clock', 'try', 'decipher', 'tape', 'mysterious', 'imagery', 'real', 'story', 'ring.The', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'horror', 'stand-out', 'are', 'accustomed', 'more', 'in-your-face', 'scare', 'scenes', 'oblique', 'style', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'young', 'girl', 'straight', 'hair', 'eyes', 'well', 'dead', 'horses', 'horrifying', 'tape', 'victims', 'add', 'up', 'cornucopia', 'disturbing', 'images', 'Ring', 'also', 'exercise', 'cerebral', 'Not', 'answers', 'are', 'given', 'up', 'front', 'thrown', 'viewers', 'face', 'Instead', 'are', 'forced', 'evaluate', 'imagery', 'subtle', 'clues', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'paraphrase', 'Hitchcock', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know/see', 'often', 'scarier', 'obvious.Overall', 'consider', 'Ring', 'be', 'seminal', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'right', 'there', 'Halloween', 'Saw', 'Given', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'bumped', 'star-rating', '4.5']",N/A
