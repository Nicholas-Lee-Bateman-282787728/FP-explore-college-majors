But this new set of Angels were NOT bad at all, it just needed TIME to grow. It was cut off too soon. After a slow start, I admit it was getting better and better and after watching the last un-aired episode, it left me wanting MORE. It wasn't fair at all to cancel it, it was pure FUN! ...

Unfortunately, the show was a terrible flop.  First the move to Miami was not necessary. The Bosley character needed to be a father/uncle figure like he was in the original not a Latin Hustler.  The whole redemption from the past thing was ok and could have worked had the relationships between the girls been true friendships and not a who's the bigger bitch contest.

This two disc set contains all eight episodes of the new ""Charlie's Angels.""  The episodes are:1) Angel With A Broken Wing2) Angels in Paradise3) Bon Voyage, Angels4) Angels in Chains5) Runway Angels6) Black Hat Angels7) Royal Angels8) Angels Never Forget (this episode did not air in the U.S.)This was such a fun series, and the Miami setting was a great backdrop for the show.  This was one of those few shows that I wish had not ended so soon, like Dark Shadows (1991 revival), or Freaks and Geeks (1999). ""Charlie's Angels"" was pretty much dead in the water before the first episode aired. I don't think ABC really got behind this production, and the press and critics were not too kind.  But, it is what it is and we have this DVD set that we can add to our collection.  I know I am grateful for that.  Now, if we can get Sony to come up with Season 5 of the original ""Charlie's Angels"", we can all rest!  If they don't want to release it, at least give the fans a MOD release to complete the collection!

But there was a chemistry in this reboot of the famous old series.  Unfortunately this series found its introduction on a network what has no courage.  (apologies) I stand corrected ABC almost never allows a series to complete its first season.  Charlie's Angels the reboot suffered the same fate as many other promising starts such as Middle Man, and 666 Park Avenue.  There is an additional episode in this pack.

What made the original work is that they worked as a team and became friends.  Even though I did not care for the CA movies all that much I liked it better than this. Nothing will ever beat the Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett team. And in later seasons Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts. And don't forget David Doyle and John Forsythe (the voice of Charlie). I am very glad that none of the women from the original show took part in this.

I told all my friends about it, my family, my teachers and we all watched the first two or three episodes. We all said the same two words about it afterwards: It sucked. Yes, bringing back old stories with new intrigue was a very good idea, but it didn't seem to be clicking. Lack of chemistry with the three leads. Poor acting. And what's up with a good-looking Bosley? No. You don't reboot something and change the concept completely. I try to think what was worse: this 2011 reboot are those uninteresting and tasteless reboot movies in the early 2000s? I'd say their tied. Maybe a better reboot will be around in the near future. I doubt it, though. This killed the Charlie's Angels legacy. Trying to rehash old glories doesn't make new ones. I mean come on, I know you need to keep up with the changing times to have an audience, but this went too far out there. Almost with a sci-fi twist to it or something. And I can't believe they released this pitiful waste of time on DVD before we got Season Five of the original series. Producers and writers sure don't know what TV audiences want anymore. I guess all we have to look forward to know are the awful ""reality"" shows. I hate those things. Reality shows are dominating the TV landscape. Bad reboots like this one, just tells those dull producers that TV well never return to its earlier roots and that reality is the new in-thing. God help us is all I can say. Pray something better happens and TV will turn around.",1,Disappointed me... big time!,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1643,"['Being', 'rather', 'new', 'fan', 'original', '1976', '1981', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'series', 'DVD', 'releases', 'reruns', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'TV', 'reboot', 'was', 'works', 'told', 'friends', 'family', 'teachers', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'said', 'same', 'two', 'words', 'sucked', 'Yes', 'bringing', 'back', 'old', 'stories', 'new', 'intrigue', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'clicking', 'Lack', 'chemistry', 'three', 'leads', 'Poor', 'acting', 'what', 'up', 'good-looking', 'Bosley', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'reboot', 'something', 'change', 'concept', 'completely', 'try', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'worse', '2011', 'reboot', 'are', 'uninteresting', 'tasteless', 'reboot', 'movies', 'early', '2000s', ""'d"", 'say', 'tied', 'Maybe', 'better', 'reboot', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'near', 'future', 'doubt', 'though', 'killed', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'legacy', 'Trying', 'rehash', 'old', 'glories', ""n't"", 'make', 'new', 'ones', 'mean', 'come', 'know', 'need', 'keep', 'up', 'changing', 'times', 'have', 'audience', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'there', 'Almost', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'released', 'pitiful', 'waste', 'time', 'DVD', 'got', 'Season', 'Five', 'original', 'series', 'Producers', 'writers', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'TV', 'audiences', 'want', 'anymore', 'guess', 'have', 'look', 'forward', 'know', 'are', 'awful', 'reality', 'shows', 'hate', 'things', 'Reality', 'shows', 'are', 'dominating', 'TV', 'landscape', 'Bad', 'reboots', 'one', 'just', 'tells', 'dull', 'producers', 'TV', 'well', 'never', 'return', 'earlier', 'roots', 'reality', 'new', 'in-thing', 'God', 'help', 'can', 'say', 'Pray', 'something', 'better', 'happens', 'TV', 'will', 'turn', 'around']",N/A
