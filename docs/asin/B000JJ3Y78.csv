Right up there with Seinfield, Curb Your Enthusiasm, as far as extreme and groundbreaking.  Amazing cast of actors; each one hilarious and with excellent characters.If you are easily offended by portrails of dysfunctional family.... Don't watch.  The humor stems from dysfunction and conflict without getting mean or painful to watch.  Anyone with a goofy family should appreciate the overall humor.  Commentary is also available on the set which is great too.  Ron Howard does an excellent job narrating and there are guest stars throughout the series.I have watched this series 3-4 times now and catch new jokes all the time... the humor is so subtle at times with witty plays on words and dual meanings, puns etc.  It stands the test of time as the series is actually like ten years old.

Maybe I just needed more time to get used to the characters. Whatever the reason, I was not interested at all. Then I came home and my brothers and sister kept talking about it so like with so many other shows, I figures I would have to try it again.Arrested Development is about a rich family that falls apart after the father is arrested for numerous misdeeds. In truth, the family was falling apart before that because they're all crazy. There's George Senior, the dad. Oscar, his identical twin brother who is pretty much a bum. Lucille, the mother of the family who is overprotective and overbearing. Gob, the oldest brother who is obsessed with magic tricks. Michael, a single father and the only responsible family member. Michael's socially awkward son George Michael who is overly studious and secretly in love with his cousin. Lindsay is Michael's twin sister (Portia de Rossi), she loves campaigning for causes and is very lazy. Tobias is Lindsay's husband, an ex-psychologist, failing actor, and a never nude (which is exactly what it sounds like). Maybee is Lindsay and Tobias's rebellious and sneaky daughter. There is Buster, the youngest Bluth who is the most developmentally stunted thanks to Lucille's attention. And I suppose we could count Anyong, the Asian boy that Lucille adopted when she wanted to teach Buster a lesson. (Anyong means hi, no one actually knows what his name is.)Michael is forced to run the company in his father's absence and mistakes. The family has so many financial problems that he has only a staircar (think the stairs for private planes) as transportation but his family seems not to understand this and continues living as though nothing has changed. Lindsay married Tobias in an act of rebellion so their marriage is always iffy.The comedy is really off-beat, sometimes in your face and sometimes subtle. I think Portia de Rossi is my favorite part of the show (she's fantastic on current show Better Off Ted) and wish there was more of her in the show. Of course, this is the show where we first meet Michael Cera, playing George Michael (so funny to see him so little!!!)Anyway, if you're looking for a show to watch, this is a great one, especially since there are plans for a movie in the works.",3,"An Off-Beat, Funny Family",1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,2352,"['first', 'time', 'tried', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'tired', 'appreciate', 'Maybe', 'just', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'characters', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'Then', 'came', 'home', 'brothers', 'sister', 'kept', 'talking', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'figures', 'would', 'have', 'try', 'again.Arrested', 'Development', 'rich', 'family', 'apart', 'father', 'arrested', 'numerous', 'misdeeds', 'truth', 'family', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'George', 'Senior', 'dad', 'Oscar', 'identical', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'bum', 'Lucille', 'mother', 'family', 'who', 'overprotective', 'overbearing', 'Gob', 'oldest', 'brother', 'who', 'obsessed', 'magic', 'tricks', 'Michael', 'single', 'father', 'only', 'responsible', 'family', 'member', 'Michael', 'socially', 'awkward', 'son', 'George', 'Michael', 'who', 'overly', 'studious', 'secretly', 'love', 'cousin', 'Lindsay', 'Michael', 'twin', 'sister', 'Portia', 'de', 'Rossi', 'campaigning', 'causes', 'very', 'lazy', 'Tobias', 'Lindsay', 'husband', 'ex-psychologist', 'failing', 'actor', 'never', 'nude', 'exactly', 'what', 'Maybee', 'Lindsay', 'Tobias', 'rebellious', 'sneaky', 'daughter', 'Buster', 'youngest', 'Bluth', 'who', 'most', 'developmentally', 'stunted', 'thanks', 'Lucille', 'attention', 'suppose', 'could', 'count', 'Anyong', 'Asian', 'boy', 'Lucille', 'adopted', 'when', 'wanted', 'teach', 'Buster', 'lesson', 'Anyong', 'hi', 'one', 'actually', 'what', 'name', 'Michael', 'forced', 'run', 'company', 'father', 'absence', 'mistakes', 'family', 'so', 'many', 'financial', 'problems', 'only', 'staircar', 'think', 'stairs', 'private', 'planes', 'transportation', 'family', 'not', 'understand', 'living', 'nothing', 'changed', 'Lindsay', 'married', 'Tobias', 'act', 'rebellion', 'marriage', 'always', 'iffy.The', 'comedy', 'really', 'off-beat', 'sometimes', 'face', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'think', 'Portia', 'de', 'Rossi', 'favorite', 'part', 'show', 'fantastic', 'current', 'show', 'Better', 'Off', 'Ted', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'show', 'course', 'show', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'playing', 'George', 'Michael', 'so', 'funny', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'looking', 'show', 'watch', 'great', 'one', 'especially', 'are', 'plans', 'movie', 'works']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

1026409,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000JJ3Y78,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","In the wake of the ""Enron"" scandal and others like it, it was amazing that such an unfunny subject could be made so hilarious. The Bluth family, in spite of the advertising to the contrary, has hardly ""lost everything"". What they have lost is the ability to charge their personal living expenses to the company after the company founder and head of the family, George Bluth, is arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud. They still have one poorly constructed model home - with nothing but sand surrounding it - plus the Bluth Development company, which actually is a legitimate business, it just hasn't been run that way up until now. They also have Michael, the only family member with a conscience and a work ethic, who works to keep the family and the company together in his father's absence. However, for the spoiled Bluths, losing access to the company jet and cars, having their country club membership downgraded to a pool membership, and having to share the roomy yet shoddily constructed model home as living quarters has them all acting like they're stranded on Gilligan's Island.The results are 53 episodes of great comedy. There are sight gags and inside jokes galore, making this series perfect for DVD where you can watch over and over until you catch everything. After you watch this you'll never again see The Blue Man Group, model homes, Mrs. Doubtfire, cut-off shorts, Michael Moore, or the phrases ""Mission Accomplished"" and ""Justice is Blind"" without thinking of this show and laughing.It may have not had stellar ratings, but it was funny and fresh up to the end. It really makes me question the reasoning of the Fox Network suits. Honestly, ""The Simpsons"" completely ran out of steam back in 1997, and yet almost ten years later they're still on the air, but Fox couldn't let this show finish out a complete third season?As for the DVD's themselves, I will have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with the extra features. There were a few good interviews, but most of the extra features consisted of deleted scenes that were not as funny as the scenes included in the actual show. One particular extra feature on season one just had the actors talking over the entire episode of ""Beef Consumme"", which, quite frankly, I found to be annoying. So buy this set for the excellent comedy, but don't expect anything special from the extra features.",5,"One of the best comedies ever, cancelled before its time",1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,2380,"['wake', 'Enron', 'scandal', 'others', 'was', 'amazing', 'unfunny', 'subject', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Bluth', 'family', 'spite', 'advertising', 'contrary', 'hardly', 'lost', 'everything', 'What', 'have', 'lost', 'ability', 'charge', 'personal', 'living', 'expenses', 'company', 'company', 'founder', 'head', 'family', 'George', 'Bluth', 'arrested', 'charged', 'embezzlement', 'fraud', 'still', 'have', 'one', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'model', 'home', 'nothing', 'sand', 'surrounding', 'Bluth', 'Development', 'company', 'actually', 'legitimate', 'business', 'just', ""n't"", 'been', 'run', 'way', 'now', 'also', 'have', 'Michael', 'only', 'family', 'member', 'conscience', 'work', 'ethic', 'who', 'keep', 'family', 'company', 'together', 'father', 'absence', 'However', 'spoiled', 'Bluths', 'losing', 'access', 'company', 'jet', 'cars', 'having', 'country', 'club', 'membership', 'downgraded', 'pool', 'membership', 'having', 'share', 'roomy', 'yet', 'shoddily', 'constructed', 'model', 'home', 'living', 'quarters', 'acting', ""'re"", 'stranded', 'Gilligan', 'Island.The', 'results', 'are', '53', 'episodes', 'great', 'comedy', 'are', 'sight', 'gags', 'inside', 'jokes', 'galore', 'making', 'series', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'catch', 'everything', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'never', 'again', 'see', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'model', 'homes', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'cut-off', 'shorts', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'phrases', 'Mission', 'Accomplished', 'Justice', 'Blind', 'thinking', 'show', 'laughing.It', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'stellar', 'ratings', 'was', 'funny', 'fresh', 'up', 'end', 'really', 'question', 'reasoning', 'Fox', 'Network', 'suits', 'Honestly', 'Simpsons', 'completely', 'ran', 'steam', 'back', '1997', 'yet', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'still', 'air', 'Fox', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'show', 'finish', 'out', 'complete', 'third', 'season', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'extra', 'features', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'interviews', 'most', 'extra', 'features', 'consisted', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'scenes', 'included', 'actual', 'show', 'One', 'particular', 'extra', 'feature', 'season', 'one', 'just', 'had', 'actors', 'talking', 'entire', 'episode', 'Beef', 'Consumme', 'quite', 'frankly', 'found', 'be', 'annoying', 'So', 'buy', 'set', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'special', 'extra', 'features']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

I was one of them and I think running your own business does build a certain kind of insanity through the family.  No one epitomizes this better than the beleaguered Bluth family. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is that one sane one whereas his mother, his brothers, his sister, et al, swirl around him pursuing their own best interests (never anyone else's best interests and certainly not the family business's best interest).  Ron Howard who produced the show also narrates it and does a wonderful job of it. The business is tanking in the wake of the senior Bluth's (the pater familias) financial wrongdoing within the firm.The biggest discovery for me on this show was Michael's lothario older brother played by Will Arnett.  I have been tuning in Will Arnett ever since this show and he is funny in everything I see.  I had never seen him before this show.  Most recently I saw him vie with Alec Baldwin's Jack on 30 ROCK for NBC's CEO position. He played a gay corporate type to perfection.I loved Jeffrey Tambor on LARRY SANDERS so was glad to see him playing the pater familias and his twin brother Oscar.  Tambor always brings a level of inept smarminess to his semi villainous characters.  They don't ever quite make it to being villains because he is always shooting himself in the foot as he tries to pull off a nefarious act.  His character is in prison in this series and he is particularly self absorbed yet bumbling from there. if the father is  smarmy, the mother, played by Jessica Walter, is the ultimate as the matriarch with a thousand schemes afoot, all to promote her own best interests.  She takes manipulative to a whole new level.Portia DeRossi plays Michael's greedy twin sister.  She is good but it is her sexually waffling husband (David Cross) who is the character to watch.  One of his many baffling but hilarious acts is to leave his career as a psychiatrist to become an actor.This was a very funny show which I totally enjoyed.

Jeanclerc ""Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[13, 14]","What made ""Arrested Development"" great also doomed it to inevitable ratings failure:  it was the sitcom series that demanded to be watched in its entirety in sequence.  Debuting just prior to the saturation of Tivo/DVRs, it failed to quickly capture a mainstream audience.  By the time the critical acclaim was pouring in, many would-be viewers tuned in for a taste, only to be frustrated by obscure plot references, running jokes, and a huge cast for a comedy.On the other hand, all of this makes ""Arrested Development"" the perfect show for viewing on DVD.  This set includes the entire run of the show - three seasons.  In a good news/bad news proposition, the show's creators knew well in advance that Fox was cancelling it, which allowed them to script an actual ending to the entire saga.  Most shows simply disappear with all of their loose ends dangling these days, but this isn't the case with AD.There isn't anything new about this release vs. the prior individual season releases - it's simply those three sets bundled together.  However, this bundle is marked down significantly compared to the individual cost of the prior sets. So, while the long-time devotee doesn't get any new content here, anyone who was tempted to try out this monumental achievement in TV comedy is now able to do so at an incredible price.

Arrested Development is a clever, dark comedy which not that many people would get, but luckily, I do.  Arrested Development tells the story of Michael Bluth who needs to keep his family together during tough times when his father goes to jail for a crime he says he didn't commit.  Michael is the normal one in a family of odd-ball characters who consist of: his selfish alcoholic mother Lucille, his clueless and materialistic twin sister Lindsay, Lindsay's psychiatrist turned actor husband Tobias (the funniest character), his magician brother Gob, his mama's boy younger brother Buster and his son George Michael who loves his cousin Maeby.  All 3 seasons are packed with their hilarious antics.  Although, I wish the series finale had a better ending, it was a wonderful series.  Take a look at the family who lost everything and the man who needed to keep them together.Special Features includes your regular commentaries, bloopers, deleted scenes, ect.Special guests throughout the season include: Amy Poeler, Ben Stiller, Charlize Theron, Carl Weathers, Martin Short, Judge Reinholds, Andy Richter, J.K.

1026444,A1U74I9FWDMGEW,B000JJ3Y78,Joshua,"[0, 0]","Arrested development is the complete package.  This is one of the funniest shows to ever grace the small screen.  The writers are at the top of their class.  The cast members were all a perfect complement for each other.  Many of the actors have grown to become big names (or possibly bigger names) after arrested development and for good reason.  Cast members include Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Portia de Rossi, David Cross, Will Arnett, Jeffery Tambor, Jessica Walter, Tony Hale, and many more on a regular or reoccurring basis.The show was narrated by none other than Ron Howard.  Unlike most modern comedies, where a laugh track informs the viewer when something funny was happening, Howard's narration provided the ideal punctuation for their specific brand of humor.  Howard's narration would come in at the perfect moment stating the obvious, arguing with or otherwise refuting dialog, reminding the viewer of something that had happened previously, or foreshadowing the future.  The very frank and honest tone of Howard's voice only added to the humorous effect of the narrator's wisdom.Arrested development is best appreciated as a whole.  If you only caught occasional episodes, you probably would have missed out on most of the key jokes.  Jokes and memes were often revisited repeatedly over the course of the show.  Others were constructed slowly over the course of multiple episodes or even entire seasons.  Sometimes it felt like the writers would bide their time, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal the one punch line that a number of other jokes were building towards (""Has anyone in this family ever seen a real chicken?"").The odd way that jokes are constructed and reused (often in passing) leads to a show that does not suffer from repeated viewings.  Every time you watch an episode from arrested development you are going to catch jokes or references that you might have missed in previous viewings.Not everyone is going to like arrested development, although the ratings show that most people do.  For lesser writers and actors, the topics that they frequently turned into jokes would come across as mildly offensive under the best circumstances (and in the worst it could easily be crude and obnoxious).  Fortunately, even the worst jokes make during the show were laugh out loud funny.  The writers for arrested development never pulled their punches, and never found a topic that was too taboo to approach.  Reoccurring jokes include racism, sexism, incest, homosexuality, cross dressing, mental retardation, open marriages, politics, treason, religion, mental illness, and just about anything else that you could conceive.Arrested development is a true gem, and many of the show's fans were excited to hear that the show would be revisited for a fourth season that culminated in an arrested development movie.",5,Comedy at its finest.,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,2844,"['Arrested', 'development', 'complete', 'package', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'screen', 'writers', 'are', 'top', 'class', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'perfect', 'complement', 'other', 'Many', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'become', 'big', 'names', 'possibly', 'bigger', 'names', 'arrested', 'development', 'good', 'reason', 'Cast', 'members', 'include', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Portia', 'de', 'Rossi', 'David', 'Cross', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Jeffery', 'Tambor', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'many', 'more', 'regular', 'reoccurring', 'basis.The', 'show', 'was', 'narrated', 'none', 'other', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'most', 'modern', 'comedies', 'where', 'laugh', 'track', 'viewer', 'when', 'something', 'funny', 'was', 'happening', 'Howard', 'narration', 'provided', 'ideal', 'punctuation', 'specific', 'brand', 'humor', 'Howard', 'narration', 'would', 'come', 'perfect', 'moment', 'stating', 'obvious', 'arguing', 'otherwise', 'refuting', 'dialog', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'something', 'had', 'happened', 'previously', 'foreshadowing', 'future', 'very', 'frank', 'honest', 'tone', 'Howard', 'voice', 'only', 'added', 'humorous', 'effect', 'narrator', 'wisdom.Arrested', 'development', 'best', 'appreciated', 'whole', 'only', 'caught', 'occasional', 'episodes', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'most', 'key', 'jokes', 'Jokes', 'memes', 'were', 'often', 'revisited', 'repeatedly', 'course', 'show', 'Others', 'were', 'constructed', 'slowly', 'course', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'even', 'entire', 'seasons', 'felt', 'writers', 'would', 'bide', 'time', 'waiting', 'perfect', 'moment', 'reveal', 'one', 'punch', 'line', 'number', 'other', 'jokes', 'were', 'building', 'towards', 'Has', 'anyone', 'family', 'ever', 'seen', 'real', 'chicken', '.The', 'odd', 'way', 'jokes', 'are', 'constructed', 'reused', 'often', 'passing', 'show', 'not', 'suffer', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'time', 'watch', 'episode', 'arrested', 'development', 'are', 'going', 'catch', 'jokes', 'references', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'previous', 'viewings.Not', 'everyone', 'going', 'like', 'arrested', 'development', 'ratings', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'lesser', 'writers', 'actors', 'topics', 'frequently', 'turned', 'jokes', 'would', 'come', 'mildly', 'offensive', 'best', 'circumstances', 'worst', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'crude', 'obnoxious', 'Fortunately', 'even', 'worst', 'jokes', 'make', 'show', 'were', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'writers', 'arrested', 'development', 'never', 'pulled', 'punches', 'never', 'found', 'topic', 'was', 'too', 'taboo', 'approach', 'Reoccurring', 'jokes', 'include', 'racism', 'sexism', 'incest', 'homosexuality', 'cross', 'dressing', 'mental', 'retardation', 'open', 'marriages', 'politics', 'treason', 'religion', 'mental', 'illness', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'conceive.Arrested', 'development', 'true', 'gem', 'many', 'show', 'fans', 'were', 'excited', 'hear', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'revisited', 'fourth', 'season', 'culminated', 'arrested', 'development', 'movie']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

Seeing the show without commercials turns it into the true work of art it was meant to be.Amazingly, the last episode is as good as the first, which is spectacularly funny and unsettlingly so.

1026455,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000JJ3Y78,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 1]","Granted, my television show tastes veer more toward the obscure, or even bizarre, but 'Arrested Development' fits neatly into my scheme of things. This is already an old show, off the air for a while now, but the cult following it has amassed is just astounding. Just like there are so many viewers who do not at all understand the appeal of ""Seinfeld"", this show may or may not work for you. Its an acquired taste, and unfortunately, many many people I have introduced this show to have been underwhelmed and decidedly bored by it.This is in part, justified. The pacing is slow, the entire enterprise is strictly dialog-driven, and the humor is always filled with double entendres and is almost always on the darker side of things. Which is why its a bonafide masterpiece. This 3-season set collects all seasons of the short-lived show (3 Discs for Season 1, 3 Discs for Season 2, 2 Discs for Season 3).Jason Bateman, in the role of a lifetime, plays the central figure, who despite being saddled with the strangest family around, eventually starts displaying his own strange and bizarre characteristics. This is a dysfunctional family to the max, with twists and turns at every corner. Everyone is self-absorbed to the n'th degree, with hardly room for any sentiment or emotion. Portia DeRossi excels in her performance here, as her icy, cool visage is offset with some truly mind-numbing lines to spout - later in career she would display similar attributes in ""Better off Ted"", but this remains her best role to date.""Arrested Development"" is about warped family dynamics, yes, but its also about creating a show that one can watch time and time again. The only two shows that have lured me in repeatedly are ""The Jeffersons"" and ""The Golden Girls"", primarily due to their stellar script and their undeniable repeat value. This show is right up there in terms of screenwriting, and memorable one-liners litter almost every episode. Its' hand-held camera technique may be offputting for some, but if you could get used to ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or even ""Friday Night Lights"", there is no reason why you won't be able to savor this.For viewers who are late to the party, this is the perfect way to collect all three seasons of this show. Its not a must-buy, but an investment that will pay you back richly in the years to come. Of all shows that I could recommend you buy entire season-packs of, ""Arrested Development"" comes in first. A masterpiece of the pen, this is easily one of the classiest shows (other than ""Frasier"") to grace the small screen.Five Stars.",5,Pitch Perfect : One of the Top 5 TV Shows of All Time,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,2565,"['Granted', 'television', 'show', 'veer', 'more', 'obscure', 'even', 'bizarre', ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'fits', 'neatly', 'scheme', 'things', 'already', 'old', 'show', 'air', 'while', 'now', 'cult', 'following', 'amassed', 'just', 'astounding', 'Just', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'appeal', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'acquired', 'taste', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'introduced', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'underwhelmed', 'decidedly', 'bored', 'it.This', 'part', 'justified', 'pacing', 'slow', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'strictly', 'dialog-driven', 'humor', 'always', 'filled', 'double', 'entendres', 'almost', 'always', 'darker', 'side', 'things', 'Which', 'why', 'bonafide', 'masterpiece', '3-season', 'set', 'collects', 'seasons', 'short-lived', 'show', '3', 'Discs', 'Season', '1', '3', 'Discs', 'Season', '2', '2', 'Discs', 'Season', '3', '.Jason', 'Bateman', 'role', 'lifetime', 'central', 'figure', 'who', 'being', 'saddled', 'strangest', 'family', 'around', 'eventually', 'displaying', 'own', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'characteristics', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'max', 'twists', 'turns', 'corner', 'Everyone', 'self-absorbed', ""n'th"", 'degree', 'hardly', 'room', 'sentiment', 'emotion', 'Portia', 'DeRossi', 'excels', 'performance', 'here', 'icy', 'cool', 'visage', 'offset', 'truly', 'mind-numbing', 'lines', 'spout', 'later', 'career', 'would', 'display', 'similar', 'attributes', 'Better', 'off', 'Ted', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'warped', 'family', 'dynamics', 'yes', 'also', 'creating', 'show', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'only', 'two', 'shows', 'have', 'lured', 'repeatedly', 'are', 'Jeffersons', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'primarily', 'due', 'stellar', 'script', 'undeniable', 'repeat', 'value', 'show', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'terms', 'screenwriting', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'litter', 'almost', 'episode', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'technique', 'may', 'be', 'offputting', 'could', 'get', 'used', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'even', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'reason', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'savor', 'this.For', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'late', 'party', 'perfect', 'way', 'collect', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'not', 'must-buy', 'investment', 'will', 'pay', 'back', 'richly', 'years', 'come', 'shows', 'could', 'recommend', 'buy', 'entire', 'season-packs', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'first', 'masterpiece', 'pen', 'easily', 'one', 'classiest', 'shows', 'other', 'Frasier', 'grace', 'small', 'screen.Five', 'Stars']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

It's always depressing watching a good thing go up in flames and well, viewers can thank Rupert Murdoch and his excellent team at FOX for this. Then again, if they brought back the horrendously repetitive Family Guy, it shouldn't be a problem bringing back something of this caliber, which by the way is absolute excellence.What else is there to say?With some of the best writing in television since the early days of Seinfeld, Mitchell Hurwitz is an absolute genius making Arrested Development one of the best shows to hit television airwaves. Narrator Ron Howard fittingly tells the story of each episode with humor and a colliding sense of foreshadowing that has expectations running high for hilarious disasters to ensue.Jason Bateman plays Michael Bluth, a family man and widower of his late wife, who comes into the business after his father, George Sr.(Jeffrey Tambor) is incarcerated for an Enron-esque scandal. The surrounding family, whose cast includes the equally exhilerating David Cross alongside newer faces Will Arnett and Michael Cera, adds ridiculous subplots that blend a healthy mixture of realism and surrealism.Each episode somehow tops the predessesor and it's impossible to try to understand how a show of this magnitude and comedic epic was able to be taken away. Perhaps buying this DVD will help bring it back and as sorry as I am to say that the DVD enticed me into the television show, hopefully the same can be said of you reading this now.More buyers means more viewers...Come one, come all!",5,"""I laughed myself to death"", an understatement",1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,1592,"['FOX', 'really', 'hit', 'wall', 'cancelling', 'one', 'TV', 'most', 'promising', 'shows', 'always', 'depressing', 'watching', 'good', 'thing', 'go', 'up', 'flames', 'well', 'viewers', 'can', 'thank', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'excellent', 'team', 'FOX', 'Then', 'again', 'brought', 'back', 'horrendously', 'repetitive', 'Family', 'Guy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'bringing', 'back', 'something', 'caliber', 'way', 'absolute', 'excellence.What', 'else', 'there', 'say', 'best', 'writing', 'television', 'early', 'days', 'Seinfeld', 'Mitchell', 'Hurwitz', 'absolute', 'genius', 'making', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'hit', 'television', 'airwaves', 'Narrator', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'fittingly', 'story', 'episode', 'humor', 'colliding', 'sense', 'foreshadowing', 'expectations', 'running', 'high', 'hilarious', 'disasters', 'ensue.Jason', 'Bateman', 'Michael', 'Bluth', 'family', 'man', 'widower', 'late', 'wife', 'who', 'business', 'father', 'George', 'Sr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'incarcerated', 'Enron-esque', 'scandal', 'surrounding', 'family', 'cast', 'equally', 'exhilerating', 'David', 'Cross', 'newer', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'ridiculous', 'subplots', 'blend', 'healthy', 'mixture', 'realism', 'surrealism.Each', 'episode', 'somehow', 'predessesor', 'impossible', 'try', 'understand', 'how', 'show', 'magnitude', 'comedic', 'epic', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Perhaps', 'buying', 'DVD', 'will', 'help', 'bring', 'back', 'as', 'sorry', 'am', 'say', 'DVD', 'enticed', 'television', 'show', 'hopefully', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'reading', 'now.More', 'buyers', 'more', 'viewers', 'Come', 'one', 'come']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series
1026461,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000JJ3Y78,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","There is a lot of subjectivity in liking any TV show, especially comedies.  If you are a fan of irreverent, inappropriate and at times uncomfortable humor you will love this series.  By now most of the people reading this review will have at least some idea of what the show is about.  Ultra dysfunctional family trying to hold on to their riches when the patriarch (played perfectly by Jeffrey Tambor) is thrown in jail for SEC violations.  While the only ""normal"" one in the bunch tries to keep the business going and the family together.What I loved about the show is that it would make fun of anything and everything.  No topic was off limits, and they definitely pushed the boundaries of what could be put on TV.  It did not rely on a laugh track to tell people when something was funny.  It presumed the audience was smart enough to figure that out on its own.  Ron Howard's narration was one of the best parts of the show.  His quips were always perfectly timed, and set up and/or punctuated the jokes better than any laugh track ever could.As I said, the humor is not for everyone.  If you like shows like Family Guy, The Office, American Dad and South Park, chances are you will love this show.  Even if you are not a fan of all those shows but are a fan of comedies, then this is definitely one worth giving a try.  I think it says a lot about the show that even after being off the air for years the entire cast is coming back to do the 10 episode season and the movie.

However, this is definetly a steal from amazon.  For one thing, we checked several stores and noone carried all three seasons.  If we would have purchased each season, from several different stores, I estimate that it would have cost us well over $80, plus tax and all that running around.  The hardest thing to do was wait for it to get to us; which took about a week.  We watched the last two seasons in one weekend -it is really that good.

1026470,A1ZDBXLPZ11CBS,B000JJ3Y78,Ralph Brown,"[269, 276]","ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT's rocky history is well known.  Loved by critics and its fans, it fought to find an audience, and its final season was a short affair.  However, the ride from the shows premier (included uncensored and expanded along with the aired version) to its conclusion (and, YES, it has a conclusion) is hilarious and worth many returns.  There are so many jokes and resonating gags that multiple viewings are REQUIRED, but your first visit to the world of the spoiled Bluth family will be a reward for unfamiliar viewers.Here are three seasons of laughs.  The series begins with the arrest of the Bluth patriarch and continues as the clan's only responsible member, Michael (portrayed by Jason Bateman), tries to keep the family's business afloat while his mother, siblings, and other family members selfishly grab for every freebie and dollar.  His mother, Lucille, is a cold, controlling alcoholic whose loyalty to her family keeps her one step from pure villainy.  His siblings include an older brother, Gob, a magician (of little skill), a younger brother, Buster, a mama's boy who eventually loses a body part to a nasty seal, and a sister whose marriage is ... complicated.  Throw in a long-suffering son infatuated with his cousin and an uncle who is the twin of his father, and you can see how complicated Michael's life becomes.Not your average family, not your average TV comedy (this is NOT a sitcom performed live in front of a studio audience but is filmed more like a documentary with the camera floating around like an unseen voyeur  -- think the old comedy series SOAP updated a la THE OFFICE).  The jokes come fast and furious.  It's all absurd and incredibly entertaining.For the record, the series is presented widescreen, and there are deleted scenes and audio commentaries for selected episodes.  To tell you the truth, I haven't even skimmed these extras, but I have watched the series in its entirety far too many times to disclose without embarrassing myself.  It's too bad that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT didn't achieve the ratings necessary to keep it afloat, but it has more laughs than comedies that lasted twice as long.",5,One Of The Funniest TV Comedies (Complete),1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,2155,"['ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'rocky', 'history', 'well', 'known', 'Loved', 'critics', 'fans', 'fought', 'find', 'audience', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'short', 'affair', 'However', 'ride', 'shows', 'premier', 'included', 'uncensored', 'expanded', 'aired', 'version', 'conclusion', 'YES', 'conclusion', 'hilarious', 'worth', 'many', 'returns', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'resonating', 'gags', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'are', 'REQUIRED', 'first', 'visit', 'world', 'spoiled', 'Bluth', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'reward', 'unfamiliar', 'are', 'three', 'seasons', 'laughs', 'series', 'arrest', 'Bluth', 'patriarch', 'clan', 'only', 'responsible', 'member', 'Michael', 'portrayed', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'keep', 'family', 'business', 'afloat', 'mother', 'siblings', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'selfishly', 'grab', 'freebie', 'dollar', 'mother', 'Lucille', 'cold', 'controlling', 'alcoholic', 'loyalty', 'family', 'one', 'step', 'pure', 'villainy', 'siblings', 'include', 'older', 'brother', 'Gob', 'magician', 'little', 'skill', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buster', 'mama', 'boy', 'who', 'eventually', 'body', 'part', 'nasty', 'seal', 'sister', 'marriage', 'complicated', 'Throw', 'long-suffering', 'son', 'infatuated', 'cousin', 'uncle', 'who', 'twin', 'father', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'complicated', 'Michael', 'life', 'average', 'family', 'not', 'average', 'TV', 'comedy', 'NOT', 'sitcom', 'performed', 'live', 'front', 'studio', 'audience', 'filmed', 'more', 'documentary', 'camera', 'floating', 'unseen', 'voyeur', 'think', 'old', 'comedy', 'series', 'SOAP', 'updated', 'la', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'jokes', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'absurd', 'incredibly', 'entertaining.For', 'record', 'series', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'tell', 'truth', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'skimmed', 'extras', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'entirety', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'disclose', 'embarrassing', 'too', 'bad', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'ratings', 'necessary', 'keep', 'afloat', 'more', 'laughs', 'comedies', 'lasted', 'twice', 'as', 'long']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

Time to stop attacking the wretched dross available on this site and embrace the very best things that makes The Curmudgeon NOT wish hot, burning death on everyone on the planet. In short - its a time of celebration. And hey - YOU'RE invited.When talking about something you like, its all too easy to get caught up in hyperbole, so that something pretty good gets described as The Best Thing Ever or something along those lines. The Curmudgeon is not guilty of this, obviously, but check out any number of reviews by some of the knuckle-draggers on this very site, and you'll see what I mean.But all the hype, all the praise and, yes, all the hyperbole, for THIS show, for this wonderfully written, expertly directed, magnificently cast show, is totally justified.It's rare to find a sitcom that doesn't actually warrant repeat viewings, but actually improves with them. There is SO much depth, so many in-jokes, sly background gags and recurring gags you have to have seen every episode at least four times before you've caught up with the writers, not to mention checking Wikipedia for stuff you may have missed. It's just THAT good.Normally there's a sitcom where there are a few characters that get the laughs and the rest are padding/straight men, but with Arrested everyone is funny. From Gob's pathetic magic act and desperation to be accepted from his dad, to Michael Bluth, who's under-the-breath comments often make for the funniest lines in the show.Everything about this Arrested Development just WORKS. The cutting satire aimed at the media (and the TV networks), the spot-on physical slapstick (David Cross's Tobias is a masterpiece of awkwardness, with some genuinely painful looking falls, slips and trips), the razor sharp script, the endlessly inventive, often surreal humour and of course the acting - every actor, from the main stars to the crop of guest stars - are both perfectly cast and acted.Basically - it's a joy to watch.It's so good in fact, that it got cancelled half way through its third season.It's hard to fathom the rank, bewildering stupidity of not only the network for cancelling it (the ratings WERE poor) but the moronic audiences sitting at home that this fantastic show was obviously too CLEVER for. What? A comedy? With no canned laughter? No will-they-won't they relationships (that don't involve teenage cousins)? No overly obvious jokes? Something that you have to think about while you watch? Something you can't sit and text your friends while its on? Who wants to watch THAT?And you know what Arrested Development got replaced by? Skating With Celebrities. God, I wish I was making that up. But no - the truth is always more depressing and devastating than fiction. And so a reality show with some dead-eyed, coke snorting z-list cretins is YOUR replacement for, and here's the truth, quite possibly the Best Sitcom - EVER.But you know what? This review is a celebration, so let's not end on a low note. But, really, how DO you end on a high note when a show like this is canned and replaced by idiot-fodder?Well, Thank God that an audience with intelligence, an attention span and a love for quality television embraced this show. Thank God that the DVDs sold well because Arrested Development: The Movie, with the original cast, writers and directors, is well into production. Happy endings are rare here in The Curmudgeon's reviews - but this could turn out to be an ecstatic one.And that, good reader, is Part One in my list of the great and the good.

1026484,A3E1JXR8IWVG5N,B000JJ3Y78,Timothy J. Drozinski,"[10, 11]","FOX just loves to cancel outstanding series.  They singlehandedly dismantled what I think are the two best shows to have aired in this decade: Firefly and Arrested Development.  When I saw the deal for the complete AD DVD set at such a bargain price I pounced... no way could I let this deal pass without adding one of the greatest TV shows of all time to my DVD collection.Arrested Development was a brilliant new approach to the sitcom.  Like some have mentioned, the fact that it was a running story could throw you off if you were jumping in in the middle of a season, or missed an episode.  But the humor was exquisitely funny and cutting-edge... they managed to really walk the finest of lines without crossing over into territory that would have pushed them into a late-night slot or relegated them to a cable-network-only show.  In some respects, it would have been interesting to see how the show would have played out on a premium network where they could really push the limits of good taste, but in a way the show was just that much funnier for the fact that the writers managed to go right up to the edge of what was allowable and just hold it there.  Perhaps if they had that little bit more freedom that a cable network like F/X or Showtime would have allowed them, it just wouldn't have been as funny.The show touches on so many fascinating but sensitive subjects over the course of the three seasons, with many interleaving arcs.  Running through the whole thing is the clever scheming of the imprisoned Bluth patriarch (played by Jeffery Tambor), and how his family manages to unwittingly sabotage his every move.  David Cross is brilliant in a disturbingly funny way (who could forget his audition for a part as an understudy for the Blue Man Group?), and Jason Bateman is charming as the overburdened prodigal son trying to return home to put things right while trying to maintain a sane relationship with his own teenaged son despite the familial chaos going on around them.  Each of the actors in this series is so well-cast, even right down to the small recurring roles like Henry Winkler as the Bluths' bumbling lawyer.This was one of the funniest, smartest comedies to air in a long time, and unfortunately it fell into the hands of FOX, who appear to not know what to do with a good thing when they find one, so they proceeded to demolish it and finally succeeded at destroying it by the third season.  Sometimes TV networks have to realize that ratings don't reflect the true value of a show like this... While Arrested Development didn't have Seinfeld-like numbers, I think this show will have legs in reruns and DVD sales, and FOX will be sorry that they canned this show after only three seasons.",5,Another fatal FOX mistake.,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,2726,"['FOX', 'just', 'cancel', 'outstanding', 'series', 'singlehandedly', 'dismantled', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'shows', 'have', 'aired', 'decade', 'Firefly', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'When', 'saw', 'deal', 'complete', 'AD', 'DVD', 'set', 'bargain', 'price', 'pounced', 'way', 'could', 'let', 'deal', 'pass', 'adding', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'DVD', 'collection.Arrested', 'Development', 'was', 'brilliant', 'new', 'approach', 'sitcom', 'have', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'was', 'running', 'story', 'could', 'throw', 'off', 'were', 'jumping', 'middle', 'season', 'missed', 'episode', 'humor', 'was', 'exquisitely', 'funny', 'cutting-edge', 'managed', 'really', 'walk', 'finest', 'lines', 'crossing', 'over', 'territory', 'would', 'have', 'pushed', 'late-night', 'slot', 'relegated', 'cable-network-only', 'show', 'respects', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'premium', 'network', 'where', 'could', 'really', 'push', 'limits', 'good', 'taste', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'funnier', 'fact', 'writers', 'managed', 'go', 'right', 'up', 'edge', 'what', 'was', 'allowable', 'just', 'hold', 'there', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'freedom', 'cable', 'network', 'F/X', 'Showtime', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'funny.The', 'show', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'fascinating', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'course', 'three', 'seasons', 'many', 'interleaving', 'arcs', 'Running', 'whole', 'thing', 'clever', 'scheming', 'imprisoned', 'Bluth', 'patriarch', 'played', 'Jeffery', 'Tambor', 'how', 'family', 'unwittingly', 'sabotage', 'move', 'David', 'Cross', 'brilliant', 'disturbingly', 'funny', 'way', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'audition', 'part', 'understudy', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'charming', 'overburdened', 'prodigal', 'son', 'trying', 'return', 'home', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'trying', 'maintain', 'sane', 'relationship', 'own', 'teenaged', 'son', 'familial', 'chaos', 'going', 'actors', 'series', 'so', 'well-cast', 'even', 'right', 'down', 'small', 'recurring', 'roles', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Bluths', 'bumbling', 'lawyer.This', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'smartest', 'comedies', 'air', 'long', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'hands', 'FOX', 'who', 'appear', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'find', 'one', 'proceeded', 'demolish', 'finally', 'succeeded', 'destroying', 'third', 'season', 'Sometimes', 'TV', 'networks', 'have', 'realize', 'ratings', 'do', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'true', 'value', 'show', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Seinfeld-like', 'numbers', 'think', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'legs', 'reruns', 'DVD', 'sales', 'FOX', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'canned', 'show', 'only', 'three', 'seasons']",Arrested Development: The Complete Series

The writing has layers and layers of humor, and I keep going back to these DVDs in good times and bad.  Equal praise to the actors, who bring humanity to their roles amidst all the slapstick and double entendres. Jason Bateman is the heart of this show and his performance is ideal-- in comedic terms he is the straight man, but his subtle reactions to the things the crazier characters say and do is one of the great sources of the humor.  My other personal favorite performance is Jessica Walters' as the mother. And Will Arnett as GOB. And every one else in the cast.
