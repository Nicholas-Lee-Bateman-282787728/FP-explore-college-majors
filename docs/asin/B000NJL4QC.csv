Well done as in great cast, great production and compelling script.On the other hand, I will never again voluntarily watch this due to the inordinate amount of vomiting, pant-crapping (or, more accurately, nightdress-crapping?), farting, and generally animalistic behaviour.

1057213,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B000NJL4QC,Carolyn Paetow,"[17, 31]","CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERSThe cast is competent--and marooned in a nearly plotless miniseries that gets more plodding and boring with each episode.  There's a lot of seasickness and vomiting, as well as urinating, defecating, farting, rashy and swollen genitals, and apparently gangrene from a complex fracture.  The latter somehow gets cured by an accident that straightens the broken leg.  Then it turns into a dislocated hip.  If it weren't for such pseudo-medical nonsense, the flick would almost seem like a Navy hygiene film.There's an ongoing overtone of homoeroticism: references to sodomy, bare-butt shots, even men peeking under other men's blankets.  The one scene of man/woman sex is the now cinematically ubiquitous type involving rushed, half-dressed, almost violent copulation with the gal propped on a table or straddling the guy.Obviously, this movie would garner few viewers if potential audiences knew about such content.  So the DVD has been packaged to look like an historical war epic.  The lead actor is pictured on the back, bloody faced, holding a sword.  Yet, in the storyline, his head wound is received clumsily bumping his head, and the expected foe turns out to be another British ship!  Worse, the photo on the front of the case displays Sam Neill as though he is the main star--when he is, in fact, a minor player who seldom appears through much of the movie.The film's social messages regarding classism, sexism, and religion are so heavy-handed that there appears to be a presumption of viewer obtuseness.

With that in place, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH  is just that- one man, young Lord Edmond Talbot's self-discovery about the just and the unjust, seedy  sides of mankind; this is all learned and ""journaled"" on a perilous, eye-opening voyage aboard an 18th-century passenger ship boarding in England and sailing to Sydney, Australia (The Antipodes). As passenger of highest born rank, the young Talbot (pronounced Talbert) learns about real life, apart from his noble rank and privilege which involves the mysterious ""murder and buggering"" of a Reverend, the suicide of a cabin keeper, dirty politics upon the High Seas and the cover up of dastardly deeds of crewman.  This drama series is as full of mystery and intrigue as it is entertaining and downright comical!!!  No small wonder, in that David Attwood,  who in 1996 brought to the screen a similar treatment of Daniel Dafoe'sThe Fortunes & Misfortunes of Moll Flanders, now has performed his similar magic with Golding's three stories with great success!  One minute you are spellbound, and the next you are laughing.  Attwood understands the necessity of building tension and the importance of a release valve!The true star of this series is Benedict Cumberbatch, as Edmond Talbot, who one year later recorded a similar triumph as William Pitt The Younger in Michael Apted's big screen biopic of abolitionist William Wilberforce inAmazing Grace. Cumberbatch is in every demanding, dialogue-laden, ship-tilting scene and the grace and power of his abilities, again, is undeniable.  Cumberbatch is proving to be one of England's rising stars with his classically trained acting and his incredible sense of character that makes this series an immense pleasure to watch. He is as skilled an actor as any out right now.  The viewer is put at total ease and assurance with the entire cast of seasoned English actors plus Australian-born veteran Sam Neill (who is most present in Episode 3) who combine with uniformly outstanding performances in this well crafted saga of real life aboard a sea ship of the time.Unlike many ""cleaner"" drama serials such asHoratio Hornblower Collector's Editionwhich concern the valour and honour of the 18th-century Royal Navy, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH is more intent of presenting all of the warts, belching, farts, and ""indelicacies"" of sea life that are far more accurate in accounting what ship passage was actually like.  The camera work is ingenious in the steadiness that it displays while watching the passengers suffer from ""riding the ship"" (getting their ""sea legs"") as well as suffering from ""mal de Mer"" (sea-sicknesses).  Having been aboard the Revolutionary War Frigate ""The Constellation"" that is anchored in Baltimore Harbour, I can attest that a series could not be more accurate at the depicting the dark, dank accommodations of cramped cabin life in the underbelly of a ship!!!Some of the interesting points that I would like to observe: (1) the music and dances aboard ship are done live (which to a musician is noted and much appreciated. No fake cello, flute or violin players HERE!) (2) The underbelly of the ship is scaled to five feet in height (normal for the time) which makes Cumberbatch's unusual 6 -foot height all the more interesting. (3) The SHIP is tossed so that the actors must adapt, NOT the camera tossing to and fro making the viewer sick! (note my comments onJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)!!!) (4) The costuming is 100% accurate, and the manners and customs of the time are well noted and observed.The only downside that I found with this series, is that Episode 3 seems rushed and edited more quickly (probably due to the death of screenplay adapter Leigh Jackson) than Episodes 1 and 2. Also, for those who have problems dealing with a myriad of English accents, alas, there are no subtitles.  I found no problem because the diction, even with the lowest ranking  sailors, is quite clear; still some may find it problematic. With those two caveats, I still highly recommend this two disc, three-part drama series as one of the finest and most absorbing mini-series of any kind.  The soundtrack is appropriately ""English and sea-worthy"" by Rob Lane who also composed for the current HBO'sJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)as well as the Emmy/Golden Globe WinningElizabeth Istarring Helen Mirren.One final note:  the part of the murdered Priest, the Rev Colley, is played by Daniel Evans, Olivier Winning stage actor who is currently on Broadway inSunday in the Park With George

1057227,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000NJL4QC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","""To The Ends Of The Earth"" is a visually impressive 3 part miniseries following the adventures of a young aristocrat Edmund Talbot, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Billed as ""an epic journey of self discovery,"" this 19th century drama follows Talbot as he boards a dilapidated war ship to make an ocean crossing. Having been assigned a government posting in Australia, Talbot is a haughty and opinionated youth that must learn to navigate not only a dangerous sea voyage, but the politics involved shipboard. Encountering death, possible mutiny, crew incompetence and brutality, an unlikely romance, passengers in search of guidance, and a heroism and leadership in difficult circumstances--this truly is the journey of Talbot's lifetime. Excellently staged and beautifully captured on film, these adventures range from harrowing to surprisingly moving. The claustrophobic and unsettling environment aboard the ship is used to maximum effect--the people on board are essentially like prisoners awaiting a release.The script is literate and believable, and some of the supporting performances are quite vivid. Sam Neill, as a fellow passenger that evolves into Talbot's mentor, and Jared Harris, as the strong and possibly dangerous captain, are the most well known actors in this impressive cast. But most of the heavy lifting goes to Cumberbatch, who is required to be the center of every scene. It's a difficult performance, it's a difficult role. Talbot is not a very likable fellow--and this may cause you to wonder if it's worth spending so much time with him. Condescending, aloof, and superior--many, including viewers, will take an instant dislike to him. Much of this is played comedically, however, so the film views his actions somewhat scornfully. There are moments when he steps up, when he shows a different side--and this is what the film hopes to showcase. Essentially, this is the journey of Talbot as he becomes a man.While I admired the film's technical merits and aspirations, I don't know that I fully believed in Talbot's transformation. This is somewhat problematic as the entire production is counting on you coming to develop an affection for him. Also, the romantic scenes never rang true and the film's ending is too pat and convenient--especially after such a messy and complicated journey. I do recommend ""To The Ends Of The Earth,"" you'll definitely want to check it out if you're a fan of this type of entertainment. I enjoyed the miniseries, but I never achieved the emotional satisfaction that I did with the stellar (and similar) ""Horatio Hornblower"" film series produced by A&E.; If you haven't seen these film, do yourself a favor--look them up right now. ""Earth"" is about 3 1/2 stars from me--mainly for my ambivalence to the lead character and the tidy conclusion.

1057242,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B000NJL4QC,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[3, 4]","Let me preference this review by saying I had a keen interest in watching this film based on one reason - An English ancestor of mine, my great, great uncle, left northern England and sailed to Australia in the early 1800's to make a new life for his family. Through ancestry research, I've found relatives in Australia and New Zealand who are alive and decedents and pictures of the graves of the brave family travelers.  So, of course, I had a great interest in what it would be like on a ship sailing to the ends of the earth from top to bottom.After seeing such stars as Benedict Cumberbatch, Sam Neill, Jared Harris, Victoria Hamilton, in the series, I had hoped to be in for a treat about life on a ship, the English separation of class, and the various interactions of the voyagers seeking out a new life elsewhere.  Frankly, as the story unfolded with each of its main themes for the three episodes, I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped to be in the substance of the series.  Nevertheless, life on the ship was an eye-opening experience from Edmund Talbot's first response upon entering the lower deck, ""What is that smell?""I can only imagine what it was like for passengers throwing up from the tossing and turning, riveted with fear of the possibility of meeting a French war ship during the voyage, or stormy weather that takes water onto the ship and threatens the old converted battleship from sinking to the depths of the ocean.  My ancestors were not aristocrats, so as tiny as the little private cabins some were given, I have no doubt they were in the dark holes of the ship shoved in like rats for most of the voyage.  Frankly, we think some have it hard on cruise ships that have problems today.  Let's face it, we have no idea of the life of the poor and what they endured while those with titles received the small benefits of status.Benedict was quite good, I thought, as he acted his voyage of travel and character realization.  The long trip and Talbot's actions to various situations serve to open his eyes to some questionable traits that cause him shame. The film is tag lined, after all, as ""An epic journey of self discovery.""Jared Harris, who I recently saw hang himself in Mad Men, was alive and well as the captain of the ship. He played a great seasoned sailor, as well as those who portrayed the crew.  The other characters from a vicar to various individuals have their own side stories, personalities, and quirks.Unfortunately, for me, I did not think it was a five-star wonder, but more of an eye opening voyage to what individuals endured traveling the stormy seas from the ends of the earth to get to a new world. For me a meaningful story leaves a lasting impression, and the only thing I felt impressed with was life on the ship and not the interactions and occurrences in the lives of the characters themselves.  There are instances of immorality that may shock some, but it's no different than portrayed in movies of the 21st century.  It's probably surprising because audiences may not wish to believe people were as indecent in that time period.

The acting was so well done, I forgot they were actors and was lost in the story. The only down side was there just wasn't enough male nudity. Sure we were teased with a few quick scenes here and there, but nothing says period piece more than a full five minute full frontal nudity of a male sailor running about the deck.
