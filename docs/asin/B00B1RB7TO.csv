Comedy is spot-on, the characters are all well done and lovable, and the fan service is great too! (If you are one of those who complain about fan service then I have to wonder why you are interested in this type of anime in the first place.) If you like harem comedies it doesn't get much better than this! I understand the Manga gets quite a bit darker than the anime. I have yet to read the manga, but if that's true I gotta think I'll like the anime better. To me the series is perfect the way it is. Lighthearted and a laugh riot start to all-to-soon finish. My only complaint is that it could/should have had a third season.As for this release... Where the heck is the Blu-ray?!?",5,I don't own the DVD...

Innuendo and skimpy outfits though to be sure.  Has an interesting story line in the almost usual school setting. Plenty of laughs with an English dub that is well done. Don't recall what the extras were or if they contained nudity like is sometimes the case. I don't see why a teenager or even a tweener couldn't watch this.,5,A fun anime,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,438,"['really', 'series', 'Just', 'fun', 'harem', 'type', 'anime', 'Does', 'have', 'fan', 'service', 'nudity', 'recall', 'Innuendo', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'be', 'sure', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'almost', 'usual', 'school', 'setting', 'Plenty', 'laughs', 'English', 'dub', 'well', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'extras', 'were', 'contained', 'nudity', 'sometimes', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'teenager', 'even', 'tweener', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch']",N/A
