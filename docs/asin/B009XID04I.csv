In my opinion, the religious setting helped to distinguish it as an original story, and it wasn't simply a gimmick for cheap laughs but was treated in a serious manner.  The writing had some nice touches.Cons: I would have liked to have seen bigger roles for the supporting cast (especially from the uncle and the second priest).  As with most romantic comedies, it has lighthearted bits sprinkled throughout but isn't uproariously funny.  And there was less physical expression of love than in most such films.",4,Good Production Quality,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,583,"['Pros', 'movie', 'had', 'excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'opinion', 'religious', 'setting', 'helped', 'distinguish', 'original', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'simply', 'gimmick', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'was', 'treated', 'serious', 'manner', 'writing', 'had', 'nice', 'touches.Cons', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'bigger', 'roles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'uncle', 'second', 'priest', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'lighthearted', 'bits', 'sprinkled', ""n't"", 'uproariously', 'funny', 'was', 'less', 'physical', 'expression', 'love', 'most', 'such', 'films']",Love So Divine

Although I Like the main actress,her character in this movie is selfish, immature & mean...there's nothing but her looks to attract the priest,so he's more in lust but thinks it's love.She gives the impression of just playing with his feelings and he's just totally confused & hot for her...fun for comedy but it gets serious when his future is at stake, is she really worth it ? It's nice that they treat the subject of religion nicely. This is really just a movie about a guy who's never fallen in love, finding out that it's a life changer",3,Nice Typical Korean comedy /Romance,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,632,"['Typical', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'mixed', 'romance', 'expect', 'type', 'Korean', 'film', 'main', 'actress', 'character', 'movie', 'selfish', 'immature', 'mean', 'nothing', 'looks', 'attract', 'priest', 'more', 'lust', 'love.She', 'impression', 'just', 'playing', 'feelings', 'just', 'totally', 'confused', 'hot', 'fun', 'comedy', 'serious', 'when', 'future', 'stake', 'really', 'nice', 'treat', 'subject', 'religion', 'nicely', 'really', 'just', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'fallen', 'love', 'finding', 'out', 'life', 'changer']",Love So Divine
