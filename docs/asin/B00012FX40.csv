I also don't care for Pilates, it's just too boring and slow, so lucky for me, that this workout is a well-rounded, challenging and intersting strength routine with various weights. The ab section contains some Pilates-inspired moves, but nothing too goofy. I originally rented this workout, but like it so much that I'm buying it. Also, Tracy looks really good (buff and toned) in this workout which is inspiring.",5,Surprisingly Good,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,520,"[""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'Dozois', 'York', 'have', 'bad', 'DVDs', 'there', 'one', 'surprised', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Pilates', 'just', 'too', 'boring', 'slow', 'so', 'lucky', 'workout', 'well-rounded', 'challenging', 'intersting', 'strength', 'routine', 'various', 'weights', 'ab', 'section', 'Pilates-inspired', 'moves', 'nothing', 'too', 'goofy', 'originally', 'rented', 'workout', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'buying', 'Also', 'Tracy', 'really', 'good', 'buff', 'toned', 'workout', 'inspiring']",N/A

I really enjoy Pilates and have certainly seen the benefits of my regular Pilates workout; however, Pilates workouts do not often address the upper body so I find I have to do a separate workout for my arms.  I also like to use some weights.  This workout fits the bill:  I get Pilates, weights and upper body work.  I also like the instructors.  I am pretty much instructor driven - I really have to enjoy the instructor or I cannot get through the workout nor enjoy the journey.  They are friendly and helpful without being over the top.

This workout is a mix of cardio with weights &amp; pilates.  If you're doing the cardio section, you'll probably want 5lb weights.  I tried it with 10lbs and found it to be a bit too much to start.  These ladies really know what they're doing.  No gimmicks whatsoever.  I'd say that if you do this 3-5 times a week and eat healthy meals, you'll have an amazing body in no time.

Miller ""Cmiller""","[1, 1]","I purchased this DVD based on the other great reviews because I was looking for a sculpting/toning workout with weights, but also a some pilates. I really enjoy this DVD because the sculpting sections have different exercises than I'm used to. The workout is broken into several different sections, so you don't have to do it all at once if you're short on time. I especially like the abs section and the floor section with weights. I'd say this is geared more for an intermediate level because there is not a lot of specific instruction on exercise form. There are two instructors, and one shows the modified form of the exercise at all times, which is helpful. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone up and add some new exercies to their routine.",5,Great workout,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,759,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'based', 'other', 'great', 'reviews', 'was', 'looking', 'sculpting/toning', 'workout', 'weights', 'also', 'pilates', 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'sculpting', 'sections', 'have', 'different', 'exercises', ""'m"", 'used', 'workout', 'broken', 'several', 'different', 'sections', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'once', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'especially', 'abs', 'section', 'floor', 'section', 'weights', ""'d"", 'say', 'geared', 'more', 'intermediate', 'level', 'not', 'lot', 'specific', 'instruction', 'exercise', 'form', 'are', 'two', 'instructors', 'one', 'modified', 'form', 'exercise', 'times', 'helpful', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'tone', 'up', 'add', 'new', 'exercies', 'routine']",N/A

Of course I was a little sore the first couple of times, but now I am comfortable with it even if I still can't do the advanced moves. This is not for the pilates beginner.  You really need to know the basics. The warm up is a really nice way of getting your heart pumping, and the floor routine works your entire body.

I'm not sure why that happened especially given the gentle, 2-3 times per month use.  For that reason, I would rate the DVD only 2-3 stars. The workout, however, I would rate 5 stars. The routine is easy to follow.  As Tracy and Michelle say, ""tough but doable"". You can do the workout with or without weights. The Pilates moves are peppered throughout.
