To this day I can't watch it without laughing out loud. The other three movies on the disc are added bonuses, all entertaining. The service was great, and the product is just what I would expect from decades old movies, a few slight imperfections, but nothing that would take away from my enjoyment.

For years (decades) fans of these movies have had to scrounge them from late night TV broadcasts and they were always chopped up (edited) to allow for commercial interruptions.
