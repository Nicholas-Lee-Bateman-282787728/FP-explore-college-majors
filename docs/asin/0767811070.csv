It is much more. This movie came out of John Singleton's personal experiences with racism and crime in South Central, like Spike Lee with ""Do the Right Thing"". But this movie was one of the first of many urban-crime films to come (i.e. New Jack City, Juice, Menace II Society, Dead Presidents). Ice Cube, a rapper at the time, made his film debut as Doughboy, the drug dealer who does the most crime on the streets on South Central. Cuba Gooding, Jr. also made his debut as Tre, a man whose father (Laurence Fishburne) teaches him how to be responsible and making the right choices. The performances were great, The rare Soundtrack had cool songs like Cube's ""South Central"" song and this movie is best of many crime films, not like the gangster films though.Singleton just put together the perfect movie to depict his old neighborhood, it's just a shame that none of his recent work is as good as Boyz N The Hood.

Also, it was a very influential movie, after this film appeared, a lot of similar movies came in; John Singleton directed a powerful film like if he was Spike Lee.""Boyz 'N The Hood"" tells the story of three black kids growing up in a dangerous neighborhood: Tre, Ricky and Doughboy; each one of the three kids is very different from the other, but they love and respect each other. The second part of the movie shows the kids now as teenagers: Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Ricky (Morris Chestnut) about to graduate from high school, and Doughboy (Ice Cube) as a trouble teen with gangster attitude. Tre is being educated by his father (Laurence Fishburne), Ricky is about to get chosen by a college due to his football abilities, and Doughboy along with other friends is about to choose the path of a gangster. But a tragedy will interrupt the life of one of this boys, and the rest must choose: get revenge and ruin their lives or go on with their lives.The realism of ""Boyz 'N The Hood"" may be its best quality, all the performances are very good, with young talents that later would be famous.

10468,A2FQ3K6PR86U62,0767811070,Alyosha,"[0, 0]","I love how films (Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, Little Miss Sunshine, The Departed, etc.) that wallow in violence, nihilism and utter vulgarity are championed among Americans for their eminent ""authenticity"" and ""originality.""  The Academy itself plays no small role in propogating this dillusion, brainwashing the movie-going public through its vast propaganda machine and finally handing out awards to the directors of some of the most barbaric trash American cinema has ever witnessed.Funny though how the rules of the game have a way of changing for films with black directors, with some of the best films of the last half century (Boyz N The Hood, Do the Rigtht Thing, X, etc.) being snubbed for their alleged inability to ""appeal to everyone.""  Meanwhile the sludge served up by the likes of Tarantino and Scorcese is eagerly devoured by anyone within arms reach of a movie shelf.Hilariously there are whole segments of the populace, tens of millions of them, that like to twist this state of affairs as reflecting some deep seeded racism amongst the rest of the citizenry.  This should give you some idea as to the state of things in America when even the most trivial of incidents (OJ, Kramer, Don Imus) are cast in a practically apocalyptic light creating nationwide panic, despair and hysteria.Simply put though American audiences don't ignore this film because they're racists.  Rather, even more pathetically perhaps, they ignore it because it wasn't marketed to their demographic.  This is something that ALL Americans regardless of race, religion, income are guilty of.  This is hardly suprising though.  Looks as if half a century's worth of ceaseless and limitless advertiseing campaigns has all but vaporized authentic individuality.  Group aspirations now trump individual choice.  Anyone that betrays the herd is tried, condemned and then excommunicated (Bill Cosby, Dennis Miller, Bill Richardson, shoot, examples from politics abound).  After all, the herd is what matters most and who could possibly understand my herd better then another member of my herd?  Better yet, how could I ever relate to anything that wasn't made by and for my herd?Individuality, personhood...gone, insinerated, nuked off the face of the earth!  As a result Americans tend to develope personalities akin to those of pre-packaged Star Wars characters.  So few are willing to step outside of the little box they've been put in.  I'm so sick of this country!  I can't even live amongst all of you!  I am at the end of my rope, I have like gone to the MATTRESSES over this, I am laying in my bed with a shotgun right now hoping that one day someone will come to my room and tell me that everything is all better.This is just a wonderful movie and it's a shame that most folks won't get a chance to see it, or if they see it to give it a chance.  Actually this movie is like the antithesis of the general mood prevailing in this country over the past few decades or so.  Singleton rightfully bucks behavioralism and the whole 'product-of-my-environment' culture of early 90's urban America because (1) he knows that human beings owe themselves more than that and (2) because shaking off that way of thinking is the only way for folks in impoverished areas to obtain a better life and dignity for themselves.More importantly though this is a response to the full frontal assault that's been waged on the American family and the American father over the past few years.  Tre's father might not be able to insulate him from all the dangers going on around their household but through rigorous discipline he does impart a sense of responsibility in Tre, responsibilty to himself, to his father and to his neighborhood.  Through their relationship the two of them are able to prevail over the despair and violence surrounding them.Fishburne, Cuba and Ice Cube all turn out the best peformances of their careers though admittedly Ice Cube has never really had a film career even after all these years of trying so hard.

""brnn64""","[1, 1]","Usually, I hate these kinds of films about ghettoes, gangsters, and guns because they tend to glorify the very things they are supposed to warn the kids against (Superfly, Belly, New Jack City, The Mack, Colors, ad nauseum). But this is different and a tad more realistic. No high rolling pimps or drug dealers with flashy cars and fine women here, just some confused, wrectheced, stupid kids who choose the wrong path (Ice Cube and co) compared to Cuba Gooding who is growing up with wise guidance. So there's no delusion of the youth here. Oh yeah, for those who are put off by Fishburne's conspiracy theories in the film, these were inspired largely by a series of lectures that Min.

10470,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767811070,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I was blown away by `Boyz `N the Hood' mainly because I really wasn't expecting anything particularly smart.  I mean, in all honesty can you say that the films title or descriptions would ever lead you to believe it would have some validity?  It does though, have a lot of validity.  Not only is it a well acted (for the most part) film but it is a really socially important film about race relations both with those outside your race, but more importantly with those within your race.  Exposing the hatred and senseless violence that pollutes certain communities, `Boyz N' the Hood' really rises above most films of this nature (take that Spike Lee) and creates a film that is emotionally investing and in the end one that is respectably sincere.The film tells the story of young Tre Styles who goes to live with his father Furious after one school screw-up too many sends his mother over the edge.  Growing up in a neighborhood less than admirable, Tre learns a lot from his father's guiding hand about bettering himself and not becoming what his friends were destined to become.  As he grows up alongside brothers Ricky and Doughboy, Tre is able to see how having a father has really kept him separate from his friends and has helped create a respectable heart in him.  His views on women and drugs and gang violence differ drastically from that of his close friends for they had no strong arm to guide them, to take care of them and thus mold them into better people.The film flows almost without much of a plot for quite a while.  Tre is falling in love with his girlfriend but is afraid to consummate that love for fear of having a child.  Ricky is striving to get a scholarship thanks to his talent as a football player.  Doughboy has created a successful life of crime for himself and is constantly waging war with a rival gang.  All the while Furious is continuing to instill in his son wisdom beyond his years, that is, until the final act of the film roles around and no amount of wisdom can prepare Tre for the choice he has to make.What I respect about `Boyz `N the Hood' is that it is realistic and honest, as apposed to a film by Spike Lee or Tyler Perry which are almost shameless (at times you can remove that word almost) in their attempt to sugar-coat things.  `Boyz `N the Hood' is gritty and sincere, even when it's falling short of its own standard.The acting is for the most part very well done.  Ice Cube is one of the only singer-turned-actor examples to think of that has really paid off.  His portrayal of Doughboy, especially in that final scene, is very strong, mature and heart touching.  Laurence Fishburne is wonderful as Furious as well.  I usually find Laurence to be somewhat monotone and stale, but here he is fantastic.  Morris Chestnut is very real as Ricky, touching upon his own charisma to create a touching and lovable character.Then there is Cuba Gooding Jr.  In all honesty, when his name came up on the screen my brother-in-law said ""he's not cool enough for this movie"" and I had to agree.  He seems very out of place.  I've never been a fan of his, although I thought that his Oscar winning performance in `Jerry Maguire' was wonderfully outlandish, and I felt that his turn here was forced and uninteresting.  He didn't bring any of the spunk and fervor he brought to `Jerry', granted, this was five years before that performance.  His breakdown after his near arrest was very over-the-top and is the films one real poor moment, for it stabs at the credibility of the film in general.  The scene is understandable in its construction, but Gooding's delivery of the material is horrendous.In the end I have to say that this is a film you really should see.  It is socially important for it touches upon truths that so often get swept under the rug for a chance at shifting blame.  This is a film where individuals stand up and say ""we can make a difference if we really want to"" and encourage others to do the same.  I will admit that knowing how sincere the film turned out to be I do wish that they had explored a little deeper the darker side of things, maybe fleshing out Doughboy's side of things a little more, but honestly, `Boyz `N the Hood' leaves little to be upset about.",4,Honest and riveting; not what I expected at all...,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,4229,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'mainly', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'particularly', 'smart', 'mean', 'honesty', 'can', 'say', 'films', 'title', 'descriptions', 'would', 'ever', 'lead', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'validity', 'have', 'lot', 'validity', 'Not', 'only', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'socially', 'important', 'film', 'race', 'relations', 'race', 'more', 'importantly', 'race', 'Exposing', 'hatred', 'senseless', 'violence', 'certain', 'communities', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'really', 'rises', 'most', 'films', 'nature', 'take', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'emotionally', 'investing', 'end', 'one', 'respectably', 'sincere.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'Tre', 'Styles', 'who', 'live', 'father', 'Furious', 'one', 'school', 'screw-up', 'too', 'many', 'mother', 'edge', 'Growing', 'up', 'neighborhood', 'less', 'admirable', 'Tre', 'lot', 'father', 'guiding', 'hand', 'bettering', 'not', 'becoming', 'what', 'friends', 'were', 'destined', 'become', 'up', 'alongside', 'brothers', 'Ricky', 'Doughboy', 'Tre', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'having', 'father', 'really', 'kept', 'separate', 'friends', 'helped', 'create', 'respectable', 'heart', 'views', 'women', 'drugs', 'gang', 'violence', 'differ', 'drastically', 'close', 'friends', 'had', 'strong', 'arm', 'guide', 'take', 'care', 'thus', 'mold', 'better', 'people.The', 'film', 'almost', 'much', 'plot', 'quite', 'while', 'Tre', 'falling', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'afraid', 'consummate', 'love', 'fear', 'having', 'child', 'Ricky', 'striving', 'get', 'scholarship', 'thanks', 'talent', 'football', 'player', 'Doughboy', 'created', 'successful', 'life', 'crime', 'constantly', 'waging', 'war', 'rival', 'gang', 'while', 'Furious', 'continuing', 'instill', 'son', 'wisdom', 'years', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'around', 'amount', 'wisdom', 'can', 'prepare', 'Tre', 'choice', 'make.What', 'respect', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'realistic', 'honest', 'apposed', 'film', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'are', 'almost', 'shameless', 'times', 'can', 'remove', 'word', 'almost', 'attempt', 'sugar-coat', 'things', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'gritty', 'sincere', 'even', 'when', 'falling', 'short', 'own', 'standard.The', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'one', 'only', 'singer-turned-actor', 'examples', 'think', 'really', 'paid', 'off', 'portrayal', 'Doughboy', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'strong', 'mature', 'heart', 'touching', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'wonderful', 'as', 'Furious', 'well', 'usually', 'find', 'Laurence', 'be', 'somewhat', 'monotone', 'stale', 'here', 'fantastic', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'very', 'real', 'Ricky', 'touching', 'own', 'charisma', 'create', 'touching', 'lovable', 'character.Then', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'honesty', 'when', 'name', 'came', 'up', 'screen', 'brother-in-law', 'said', 'not', 'cool', 'enough', 'movie', 'had', 'agree', 'very', 'place', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'thought', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'outlandish', 'felt', 'turn', 'here', 'was', 'forced', 'uninteresting', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'spunk', 'fervor', 'brought', 'Jerry', 'granted', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'performance', 'breakdown', 'near', 'arrest', 'was', 'very', 'over-the-top', 'films', 'one', 'real', 'poor', 'moment', 'credibility', 'film', 'general', 'scene', 'understandable', 'construction', 'Gooding', 'delivery', 'material', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'socially', 'important', 'truths', 'so', 'often', 'get', 'swept', 'rug', 'chance', 'shifting', 'blame', 'film', 'where', 'individuals', 'stand', 'up', 'say', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'really', 'want', 'encourage', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'will', 'admit', 'knowing', 'how', 'sincere', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'explored', 'little', 'deeper', 'darker', 'side', 'things', 'maybe', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Doughboy', 'side', 'things', 'little', 'more', 'honestly', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'little', 'be', 'upset']",N/A

It is also a definite masterpiece. As The Bicycle Thief carried the Italian Neo-realism movement, Boyz n the Hood captured the essence of it with its untested cast. Monster performances are given by everybody. The message Boyz n the Hood brings out is sharp and direct to the point and is fully impacting. Of course, how biased the Academy Awards committee is, Boyz n the Hood should have racked up a numerous of nominations. Starting with the cast, Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, and Tyra Ferrell were overlooked. Then, add the Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Costume, Best Music, Best Director, and Best Original Story. That makes it `10' for Boyz n the Hood. To my surprise and still to this day, Ice Cube received no critical acclaim for his brilliant performance, and in my mind, he won the award for that year. How brilliant was Ice Cube? From his first line to the ending, Ice Cube displayed this natural seriousness and delivered his lines to perfection. That emotional scene where the climax reaches is completely mind-blowing every time I see it. It's something I look forward to and appreciate the realism of that shot. I love how the story plays out and how the director makes the use of each and every character without leaving any out. The character development is just so right and terse yet meaningful. It features a gritty urban story of youth trapped in a barren wasteland, trying to make it out for the betterment of their lives while most get caught in the process of the life. I love how John Singleton points out the small details during the movie. All in all, Boyz n the Hood ranks one of the great pictures ever made and one of the finest, if not ever, in black cinema.10/10: As real as it gets, Boyz n the Hood is one of the most powerful films I've seen. It couldn't be any more dramatic than the scene where Tre yells out to Ricky in some alley. Then, there is a shattering moment where Doughboy is misunderstood but may be the blame for the loss of his brother's life. 1991 was the year that ice Cube should have won the supporting actor award by a landslide, and sadly, he wasn't even recognized a bit for his work. His was one of the best performances I've seen in any film. I've not seen a Black film this good with an exception of Hoop Dreams. The cast elevated Boyz n the Hood into a new territory with common themes implemented, but the direction of John Singleton is the key changing element. He brought in the message and showed it in a subtle way. He wanted the impact felt when Ricky gets brutally shot down. He wanted it to be loud and clear that Black communities did face this reality daily and even to this day. All in all, Boyz n the Hood is a film that deserves to be seen over and over throughout the years; it is that good. By the way, as not a lot of people notice, there is a one great line in the film uttered by Ricky where he says, ""Baby got more cakes than Duncan Hines."" That one sort of got stuck in my mind.",5,RUN Ricky...Damn It.,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,3160,"['Viewed', '10/03', '11/04', '10/05', '10/10Rate', '1010/05', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'serious', 'compelling', 'film', 'life', 'black', 'youth', 'ghetto', 'plagued', 'drugs', 'gangs', 'also', 'definite', 'masterpiece', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'carried', 'Italian', 'Neo-realism', 'movement', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'captured', 'essence', 'untested', 'cast', 'Monster', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'everybody', 'message', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'out', 'sharp', 'direct', 'point', 'fully', 'impacting', 'course', 'how', 'biased', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'committee', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'should', 'have', 'racked', 'up', 'numerous', 'nominations', 'Starting', 'cast', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Tyra', 'Ferrell', 'were', 'overlooked', 'Then', 'add', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Best', 'Music', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Original', 'Story', '10', 'Boyz', 'n', 'Hood', 'surprise', 'still', 'day', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'mind', 'won', 'award', 'year', 'How', 'brilliant', 'was', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'first', 'line', 'ending', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'displayed', 'natural', 'seriousness', 'delivered', 'lines', 'perfection', 'emotional', 'scene', 'where', 'climax', 'completely', 'mind-blowing', 'time', 'see', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'appreciate', 'realism', 'shot', 'love', 'how', 'story', 'out', 'how', 'director', 'use', 'character', 'leaving', 'out', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'so', 'right', 'terse', 'yet', 'meaningful', 'gritty', 'urban', 'story', 'youth', 'trapped', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'trying', 'make', 'out', 'betterment', 'lives', 'most', 'get', 'caught', 'process', 'life', 'love', 'how', 'John', 'Singleton', 'out', 'small', 'details', 'movie', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'one', 'great', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'finest', 'not', 'ever', 'black', 'cinema.10/10', 'As', 'real', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'where', 'Tre', 'out', 'Ricky', 'alley', 'Then', 'shattering', 'moment', 'where', 'Doughboy', 'misunderstood', 'may', 'be', 'blame', 'loss', 'brother', 'life', '1991', 'was', 'year', 'ice', 'Cube', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'supporting', 'actor', 'award', 'landslide', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognized', 'bit', 'work', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'Black', 'film', 'good', 'exception', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'cast', 'elevated', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'new', 'territory', 'common', 'themes', 'implemented', 'direction', 'John', 'Singleton', 'key', 'changing', 'element', 'brought', 'message', 'showed', 'subtle', 'way', 'wanted', 'impact', 'felt', 'when', 'Ricky', 'brutally', 'shot', 'down', 'wanted', 'be', 'loud', 'clear', 'Black', 'communities', 'did', 'face', 'reality', 'daily', 'even', 'day', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'years', 'good', 'way', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'notice', 'one', 'great', 'line', 'film', 'uttered', 'Ricky', 'where', 'Baby', 'got', 'more', 'cakes', 'Duncan', 'Hines', 'one', 'sort', 'got', 'stuck', 'mind']",N/A

The greatest aspect of this movie is that it's a film about acceptance when focusing around the main character Tr&eacute;. He's a representative for those of us who have all told lies about our lives simply to fit in with the crowd. We can all relate to the Tr&eacute; character which is what is easily one of the main reasons for this films popularity.Set in South Central L.A. ""Boyz N The Hood"" focuses around three friends with very different aspirations in life.""Doughboy"" played by Ice Cube is a man who's become the typical kid growing up in the hood and succumbed to the Drink, Drugs and crime.""Ricky Baker"" played by Morris Chestnut is the all American athlete who's looking to win a sports scholarship to USC and make something of his life.""Tr&eacute; Styles"" played by Cube Gooding Jr. is the kid in the middle being pulled by both sides. Tr&eacute; is lucky enough to have a father who's showing him to do what is right and always take responsibility for his actions.In this film, while in the hood with his old school friends, Tr&eacute; is seriously confused about where his life is going. Although his father is teaching him about the right way to live his life, Tr&eacute; is being pulled by ""Doughboy"" to follow the hood lifestyle which is glorified by ""Doughboys"" code of honour. This is truly realistic piece and as an early role for both Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding this was a great way to start an acting career. This is easily Singletons greatest work with which he has yet to gain the same level of success. It's an enjoyable movie that every film fan can sit and watch all the way through.

10477,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,0767811070,Charles J. Rector,"[3, 3]","Boyz n the Hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990's. It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on thesituation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it.At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says ""One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male."" If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of thesefilms today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message.The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4ths of the city's total.This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Tr&eacute; Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today.Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available.The movie starts when Tre's mother sends himto live with his father Jason, a/k/a ""Furious"", whois much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, whileanother friend Doughboy has already graduated - fromshoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring.The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows thedire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning.",5,Excellent Movie With a Strong Message,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,3036,"['Boyz', 'Hood', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', '1990', 'excellent', 'movie', 'life', 'mean', 'streets', 'inner', 'city', 'as', 'well', 'reinforcer', 'moral', 'values', 'needed', 'turn', 'around', 'situation', 'Urban', 'America', 'where', 'youth', 'gangs', 'run', 'rampant', 'course', 'story', 'much', 'needed', 'commentary', 'thesituation', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'it.At', 'start', 'movie', 'subtitle', 'One', 'out', '21', 'black', 'males', 'will', 'be', 'murdered', 'lifetime', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'hands', 'black', 'male', 'anything', 'fact', 'even', 'worse', 'today', 'Most', 'flicks', 'today', 'are', 'inner', 'city', 'crime', 'scene', 'have', 'taken', 'many', 'concepts', 'film', 'many', 'thesefilms', 'today', 'are', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'movies', 'have', 'morality', 'strong', 'plot', 'serious', 'social', 'message.The', 'setting', 'flick', 'South', 'Central', 'L.A.', 'Where', 'murder', 'rates', 'are', 'five', 'times', 'nationwide', 'average', 'absolute', 'figures', 'double', 'entire', 'U.S.', 'death', 'rate', 'breast', 'cancer', 'past', 'two', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'accumulated', 'backlog', '4,400', 'unsolved', 'homicides', 'roughly', '3/4ths', 'city', 'total.This', 'gripping', 'tale', 'evolves', 'single', 'black', 'father', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'raising', 'one', 'only', 'son', 'Tr', 'eacute', 'Styles', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'installing', 'values', 'help', 'become', 'man', 'important', 'point', 'director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'took', 'time', 'illustrate', 'majority', 'men', 'black', 'community', 'are', 'often', 'raised', 'single', 'mothers', 'values', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'instills', 'Tre', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'portrayed', 'most', 'movies', 'today.Essentially', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'movie', 'peace', 'message', 'violence', ""n't"", 'answer', 'movie', 'effects', 'violence', 'being', 'what', 'residents', 'inner', 'city', 'too', 'frequently', 'when', 'are', 'other', 'alternatives', 'available.The', 'movie', 'starts', 'when', 'Tre', 'mother', 'himto', 'live', 'father', 'Jason', 'Furious', 'whois', 'much', 'better', 'equipped', 'raise', 'son', 'neighborhood', 'movie', 'quickly', 'forward', 'seven', 'years', 'when', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'Tre', 'best', 'friend', 'Ricky', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'whileanother', 'friend', 'Doughboy', 'already', 'graduated', 'fromshoplifting', 'guns', 'small-time', 'drug', 'deals', 'Furious', 'guides', 'Tre', 'towards', 'moral', 'choices', 'responsibility', 'self-respect', 'Doughboy', 'Ricky', 'are', 'raised', 'mother', 'who', 'capacity', 'instill', 'proper', 'values', 'morals', 'offspring.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'can', 'Tre', 'avoid', 'crime', 'drug', 'scene', 'live', 'normal', 'decent', 'life', 'more', 'challenging', 'given', 'crime', 'violence', 'Boyz', 'Hoodis', 'excellent', 'film', 'drama', 'based', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'thedire', 'straits', 'folks', 'South', 'Central', 'are', 'being', 'conscending', 'exploitative', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'flick', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'cinematography', 'stunning']",N/A

Singleton does so much more for all African Americans with this work than any and perhaps all political figures who've tried to represent them because he shows that African Americans share the same aspirations and goals, have many of the same issues as any one else, though in this setting danger, fear, paranoia and lawlessness threaten any kind of normalcy a family might hope for.I lived in the area as a child, during the same time frame the main characters did when portrayed as children.

Black males are portrayed as overly aggressive, violent street thugs or controlling, suspicious dads trying to ""save"" their sons by taking them away from their mums.  The depiction of black females is no better; they are portrayed as irresponsible, loud, and always having sex and getting pregnant.The depiction of blacks in general is very insulting; it portrays most of them as ignorant, aggressive, hostile to non-blacks, trouble-making, idle, poor, lazy, and loud.The plot of the film is Tre's mum basically giving up and sending him to live with his dad.  It discredits single moms and black females; the message given is that females are too ""weak"" to raise sons without the rescue of a man.  Tre's dad then takes over Tre's life and shoves his mom out of the picture as if she were an unimportant footnote in her own son's life.  The sexist message given here is that allegedly, only adult men can solve problems of child raising in a poor area of the city, which of course is an incorrect stereotype.It would have been so much better if Tre had remained with his mom; his mom had been portrayed as strong enough to keep Tre from getting into drugs and crime and if kids of different races could band together and fight crime and drugs.  It also would have been better if maybe there had been school scenes that made it clear that kids of ANY race, white, black, or mixed can get into drugs, crime, and can get pregnant, not just black kids. No kid, whether they are male or female and no matter what race or ethnic background they belong to, is immune to this dead end trap and both male AND female parents, whether they are single or married, are equally capable of guiding their children to steer clear of these common pitfalls.",2,Way too many stereotypes...,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1793,"['Way', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'racist', 'sexist', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'Black', 'males', 'are', 'portrayed', 'overly', 'aggressive', 'violent', 'street', 'thugs', 'controlling', 'suspicious', 'dads', 'trying', 'save', 'sons', 'taking', 'away', 'mums', 'depiction', 'black', 'females', 'better', 'are', 'portrayed', 'irresponsible', 'loud', 'always', 'having', 'sex', 'getting', 'pregnant.The', 'depiction', 'blacks', 'general', 'very', 'insulting', 'most', 'ignorant', 'aggressive', 'hostile', 'non-blacks', 'trouble-making', 'idle', 'poor', 'lazy', 'loud.The', 'plot', 'film', 'Tre', 'mum', 'basically', 'giving', 'up', 'sending', 'live', 'dad', 'single', 'moms', 'black', 'females', 'message', 'given', 'females', 'are', 'too', 'weak', 'raise', 'sons', 'rescue', 'man', 'Tre', 'dad', 'then', 'Tre', 'life', 'mom', 'picture', 'were', 'unimportant', 'footnote', 'own', 'son', 'life', 'sexist', 'message', 'given', 'here', 'allegedly', 'only', 'men', 'can', 'solve', 'problems', 'child', 'raising', 'poor', 'area', 'city', 'course', 'incorrect', 'stereotype.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Tre', 'had', 'remained', 'mom', 'mom', 'had', 'been', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'Tre', 'getting', 'drugs', 'crime', 'kids', 'different', 'races', 'could', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'crime', 'drugs', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'maybe', 'had', 'been', 'school', 'scenes', 'made', 'clear', 'kids', 'ANY', 'race', 'white', 'black', 'mixed', 'can', 'get', 'drugs', 'crime', 'can', 'get', 'pregnant', 'not', 'just', 'black', 'kids', 'kid', 'are', 'male', 'female', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'ethnic', 'background', 'belong', 'immune', 'dead', 'end', 'trap', 'male', 'female', 'parents', 'are', 'single', 'married', 'are', 'equally', 'capable', 'guiding', 'children', 'steer', 'clear', 'common', 'pitfalls']",N/A

John Singleton's film debut was one of the first films to take a realistic look at what was really going on in many urban California neighborhoods at the time. Telling parts of his own childhood story, Singleton gave us some deep, social commentary mixed with some groundbreaking performances from a number of relative newcomers.Cuba Gooding, Jr. is Tre Styles, a young black male growing up in South Central during the turbulent and violent early 90's. Under the watching eyes and guiding hand of his father, Furious (played brilliantly by Laurence Fishburne), Tre learns life's difficult lessons as with friends and family, he battles the harsh world that is out there on the streets.&quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot; is one of the most movies that is hard to forget. Once you've seen it, chances are that you will want to experience it again. While later films in the genre exploited violent images and often glorified them for entertainment purposes, this movies touches on the emotion behind the violence. When there is violence even towards characters that we may perceive as &quot;bad&quot;, the film shows us the honest consquences.While there are many excellent performances here, it is first-time actor Ice Cube's portrayal of &quot;Dough Boy&quot; that really had audiences talking. No matter how many times I view the film's emotional climax, I always &quot;feel&quot; it. Cube's closing monolouge is just so genuine and powerful. As he walks off, fading into memory, we feel that loss. Dough Boy isn't some poor black sterotype that blows away people without thinking twice. He has human qualities. Even when he is doing things we don't agree with it, he is sympathetic. He is angry about the lack of love that he gets from his mother who praises his brother but shuns him. Despite fighting with his brother, he still runs to his rescue, moments later. Dough Boy is portrayed in a way that he can be hard-edged but we still can relate to his suffering. That seems to be what is missing from many of these hood films that try to duplicate &quot;Boyz&quot;.&quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot; was and still is one of the most important films in the genre. This DVD offers a lot of things that many fans have been waiting for such as an audio commentary, a featurette looking back at the film's making, and two deleted scenes. While the first omitted scene is a rather pointless back and forth between Gooding's Tre and his mother, played by Angela Basset, the second scene featuring the movie's stand-out characters Dough Boy and Furious is excellent. This DVD is definetly worth picking up for any true fan of this epic film.",5,BOYZ N THE HOOD Special Edition DVD Review,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,2725,"['Finally', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'proper', 'treatmant', 'DVD', 'double-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'John', 'Singleton', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'take', 'realistic', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'many', 'urban', 'California', 'neighborhoods', 'time', 'Telling', 'parts', 'own', 'childhood', 'story', 'Singleton', 'gave', 'deep', 'social', 'commentary', 'mixed', 'groundbreaking', 'performances', 'number', 'relative', 'newcomers.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Tre', 'Styles', 'young', 'black', 'male', 'growing', 'up', 'South', 'Central', 'turbulent', 'violent', 'early', '90', 'watching', 'eyes', 'guiding', 'hand', 'father', 'Furious', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Tre', 'life', 'difficult', 'lessons', 'friends', 'family', 'harsh', 'world', 'out', 'there', 'streets.', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'movies', 'hard', 'forget', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'want', 'experience', 'again', 'later', 'films', 'genre', 'exploited', 'violent', 'images', 'often', 'glorified', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'movies', 'emotion', 'violence', 'When', 'violence', 'even', 'characters', 'may', 'perceive', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'film', 'honest', 'consquences.While', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'performances', 'here', 'first-time', 'actor', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'portrayal', 'quot', 'Dough', 'Boy', 'quot', 'really', 'had', 'audiences', 'talking', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'view', 'film', 'emotional', 'climax', 'always', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'Cube', 'closing', 'monolouge', 'just', 'so', 'genuine', 'powerful', 'fading', 'memory', 'feel', 'loss', 'Dough', 'Boy', ""n't"", 'poor', 'black', 'sterotype', 'away', 'people', 'thinking', 'twice', 'human', 'qualities', 'Even', 'when', 'doing', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'sympathetic', 'angry', 'lack', 'love', 'mother', 'who', 'brother', 'fighting', 'brother', 'still', 'rescue', 'moments', 'later', 'Dough', 'Boy', 'portrayed', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'hard-edged', 'still', 'can', 'relate', 'suffering', 'be', 'what', 'missing', 'many', 'hood', 'films', 'try', 'duplicate', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'quot', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'genre', 'DVD', 'lot', 'things', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'such', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'looking', 'back', 'film', 'making', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'first', 'omitted', 'scene', 'rather', 'pointless', 'back', 'forth', 'Gooding', 'Tre', 'mother', 'played', 'Angela', 'Basset', 'second', 'scene', 'featuring', 'movie', 'stand-out', 'characters', 'Dough', 'Boy', 'Furious', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'definetly', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'true', 'fan', 'epic', 'film']",N/A

It stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Lawrence Fishburne, and Angela Bassett.  This wonderfully written plot explores the lives of three young men strugging with everyday living.  Two of them, while struggling to stay lawful citizens, hold high hopes of leaving that neighborhood and pursue higher dreams.  Little do they know that their actions affect the community and their families.  This film never holds back on the harshness of the violence and the environment.  Each character holds their own persona that makes this film more powerful.  The actors perform their characters beautifully, especially Gooding and Fishburne.  All express wonderfully the individual everyday struggles.  Such tremendous film quality makes ""Boyz 'N the Hood"" worth watching.  Other films with similar theme followed shortly after this release (""Menace II Society"", ""New Jack City""), but none surpass this one.

10487,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767811070,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","In 1991, ""Boyz in the Hood"" was seen as a film about the hood that got things right!  A film that would showcase to society all around the world about what was taking place in South Central Los Angeles, a statement of what life is in the hood but also for American cinema, showing us the strength of cinema created by a young African-American director and a relatively unknown African-American cast.Well-created, well-written and powerful performances that continue to hold up today, ""Boyz in the Hood"" was more of a statement of violence in South Central Los Angeles, it was a statement of inner city violence and giving a voice to those who live with this violence around them everyday, 24/7.The film would be the theatrical debut of filmmaker John Singleton (""2 Fast 2 Furious"", ""Shaft"", ""Four Brothers"") and a film that would earn him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and Best Writing and would be the acting debut of hip hop star Ice Cube (""Friday"", ""Barbershop"", ""xXx: State of the Union"") and the first major theatrical role for actor Cuba Gooding Jr. (""Jerry Maguire"", ""Men of Honor"", ""Pearl Harbor"").The film would rank in the top 10 of the American Film Institute's "" Top 10 Gangster Films"" and in 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film ""Culturally significant"" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.VIDEO:""Boyz n the Hood"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Having owned this film in a variety of home video versions, I can easily say that the Blu-ray release is much more detailed than the any previous video version.  You can see the detail in the hair of Tre and Doughboy, you can see the colors which are much more vibrant on video, skin tones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.While the film does show its age due to the early '90s clothing and this film is not going to look like it was made recently, I can say that for its 20-year anniversary, this Blu-ray release is the definitive version of the film yet.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Boyz n the Hood"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, German and Italian 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film, there are some moments of crowd ambiance and scenes where there are gunshots and surround channels are used.  It's not a immersive film in the sense that you have active surround channels but the dialogue and music for the film is crystal clear and sounds great via lossless.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Swedish, Thai and Turkish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Boyz n the Hood "" comes with the following special features:Director's Commentary - A wonderful in-depth audio commentary by director John Singleton.The Enduring Significance of Boyz N the Hood - (24:48) Presented in HD, the director and cast are interviewed about the importance of ""Boyz n the Hood"" and what the film meant to them.Friendly Fire: Making Of An Urban Legend - (43:17) The original special feature in standard definition for ""Boyz n the Hood"" with interviews with John Singleton, the producers of the film and the cast.Deleted Scenes - (4:25) Featuring two deleted scenes: Tre discusses the future with his mom and Furious confronts Doughboy after Ricky is shot.  In standard definition.Music Videos - (9:00) featuring the music videos - Compton's Most Wanted Music Video Growin' Up in the Hood and Tevin Campbell Music Video Just Ask MeAudition Videos - Featuring a split screen audition videos (use your audio button to change to the audio of the certain cast member) featuring Ice Cube, Angela Bassett, Morris Chestnut & Tyra FerrellJUDGMENT CALL:Powerful, thought-provoking, well-crafted and a magnificent film from filmmaker John Singleton!""Boyz n the Hood"" is a film that actually remains close to my heart, mainly because when I first watched it, I was a young adult at the time and it was one of the first films where I got into an explosive debate with another viewer.I can easily remember at the time when the viewer made the comment of how the film was ""fluff"" and was nothing but a film to propagate gangster culture.  Needless to say, the debate was heated and it was the only instance in my life where I was quite shocked by how anyone would look at this film as ""fluff"" and dare I say it, I was about to throw down.For me, the film was thought-provoking and important.  I personally have had the experience of moving into Southern California, being a new person and just being in awe, fear and shock about gangs.  I never had to experience that growing up but going to high school in Southern California and reading day-after-day of gang shootings, even myself experiencing parties being attacked by gangs and just seeing how things were, it was something that I was never accustomed to.From seeing gated high schools to hearing about people from other high schools crashing into other high schools and stealing from students.  Even experiencing trouble when I went to visit a friend at another high school and there was a gang fight and because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and someone from another high school, I was taken in and having to face the school administration.  I just remember that it was too much and trying to explain that I know nothing about gangs, I'm just a guy from small town and here I was in a city where crime is taking place in schools, fears of gangs are not only at school but you worry about it on the bus ride home, walking home alone in the neighborhood and afraid of getting jacked at night, these were things that were uncommon to me and scared the crap out of me.  Especially having to be asked constantly from other young teenagers at the time, ""What set you from?"" and having no idea what the heck they were talking about.With the opening statement at the beginning of the film:  ""One out of every twenty-one black American males will be murdered in their lifetime."" and ""Most will die at the hands of another black male.""Those are low odds and it seems that its hard to believe in but having read the newspapers, seeing it every night on the news, these situations happen in South Central Los Angeles.But this is normal life for a lot of people.  For me, it was completely foreign but I was intrigued by all of it because it's something that I never saw reported where I lived in.  And here I was in So. California, watching films like ""Colors"" and listening to N.W.A. and heading to the local hip hop store in Long Beach to check out the latest hip hop that I've heard on KDAY.And I remember moving out of So. California and just thinking, ""It's a shame that no one knows about the violence in South Central Los Angeles.  It's a warzone out there!""And so I was deeply touched by the film because John Singleton had a deep message about this film, about the state of blacks in the hood, about trying to solve the problem but knowing that the cycle of retaliation keeps going and going.  And  because it showed how lives in the hood can be changed in an instant for families and friends and its a cycle of sadness and death, unless there are those who want to make a change.And so when I first watched this film and one person declaring it as ""fluff"" and ""propagating gangster lifestyle"", I took offense to the comment.This was not about gang lifestyle, this was about lifestyle in a predominately African-American area where there are those who want to make a difference and those who are part of that continuing cycle of violence.  It was a problem that was starting to reach a boiling point in American media and because of the music and films like ""Boyz n the Hood"", it was a film that showed the world about things that I was constantly seeing on the newspapers and news.You feel for these characters because personally, I have read way too many articles in my lifetime about talented young athletes and innocent people gunned down because they were mistaken for someone else or did something to tick someone off but it's a life of fear that happens on a weekly basis in South Central and other areas around the United States.  This is how life is, it's not ""fluff"" and I was so angry about the comment that I was debating so passionately defending the film because I know that those characters, those situations as depicted in the film was very realistic.So, it surprises me that 20-years-later, the film has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, the film received two Academy Award nominations and it would help initiate the surge in the careers of filmmaker John Singleton, rapper Ice Cube, actors Cuba Gooding Jr. and Morris Chestnut.  The film was well-acted and felt it was well-done!So, here we are with a 20th Anniversary release of ""Boyz n the Hood"".  Featuring the same special features on DVD but with a Blu-ray exclusive on the enduring significance of the film.If you have never watched the DVD before, then this is a pretty solid Blu-ray release.  Granted, not all special features will be in High-Definition but having owned this film previously on VHS and DVD, I can easily say that this is the definitive version to own of the film at this time.Overall, ""Boyz n the Hood"" is a thought-provoking and wonderfully-crafted film from John Singleton.  It came out at the right time and really spotlighted the problems that were taking place in South Central and bringing it to the masses and for the most part, its long-lasting efficacy was that its a true film.Characters and situations that seem realistic and for the most part, the situation of what was boiling at the time in South Central Los Angeles made a statement in society.  But now knowing that even today, not just in South Central Los Angeles but all over the country and these problems still exist and thus the film still has relevance today.""Boyz n the Hood"" is a film that is American cinema at its best and also an important film that help take part in giving recognition to Black filmmakers but also talent.This film is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Powerful, thought-provoking and a film that made a statement on variety of levels.

Lawrence Fishburne and Morris Chestnut add further depth to a strong cast.All in all a very real, gritty depiction of the challenges faced at every turn by African American men and women in modern America. The building anger bristling beneath the surface in so many scenes is particularly resonant given the outburst of violence in the Rodney King Riots that took place in the very same city of the story just one year later.The film spawned several 'urban gang flick' imitations in subsequent years, but most glorified violence and placed an emphasis on a loud soundtrack and sexual explicitness at the expense of strong plot-line, good character development and a serious social message.

Each one with their own individual struggle and goals in life. Doughboy (Ice Cube) ,who is a drug dealer, has been in and out of trouble throughout his young life and seems to be happy with his surroundings. Doughboy's brother Ricky (Morris Chestnut) a teenage father with bright hopes and aspirations of becoming an NFL football player ; and Ricky's best friend Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who hopes and dreams of higher education and an escape from the dwelling of the hood. ""The Hood"" where saying the wrong thing or looking at someone the wrong way can end in death. Tre's father (Larry Fishburne) is a responsible, educated and strict father who makes sure his son stays on the right track in achieving his goals in life. Teaching him about responsibility and keeping your cool in adverse situations in order to make a thoughtful descision. Tre's resolve will be tested when tragedy strikes close to home and revenge and murder seem like the only solution.Fantastic direction by John Singleton and equally impressive acting by all characters are the reason Boyz N the Hood was such a huge success.

The first 20 minutes are excellent but then it kind of goes to the dogs.The movie starts off with Tre (Cuba Gooding Junior), having to  leave his mother because of breaking a promise to go live with his father Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). He meets friends, half brothers, Ricky and Doughboy (Ice Cube). You see as they grow up in some very effective moments. Then it jumps 15 years later...and the movie goes sour.Later on, we've got these boys all grown up with Tre living a pretty descent life, Doughboy into violence, drugs, alcohol while Ricky is a smart kid and an all pro football player trying to get into USC.Now there's cussing, violence, the typical you'd expect from a movie this intense but it throws in random humor and just isn't very interesting.

It illustrates the fact that the vast majority of black murderers kill black victims. It is in fact the same thing as for white murderers and white victims. Who is the copy cat? Or is it a rule that you murder one of your own? In other words crime is not racist, not even racial, in its vast majority. It is nothing but the result of a social, cultural, ideological, economic and political situation that nurtures it. But the film provides absolutely no answer about that social situation. Cynical black cops who can only repress, even the innocent, when they do something at all, especially when that innocent is black, though most of the time these cops do nothing as for protecting the black community against the crime it feeds and raises in its own heart like a pet in a home. There is no hope except escape, go away as far as possible to free ourselves from the white plot that locks blacks together to produce a self-destructive boiling pot of a community, not even seeing it may be a time bomb that could harm the whole society when it explodes. It only wants to impress the audience with a fate, a fatality and create in its audience a feeling, emotion of total rejection based on disgust, maybe even hatred.

10510,A1UUVQS8X31RH1,0767811070,Kalie A. Gipson,"[4, 4]","The 1991 classic film ""Boyz N The Hood"" is an unforgettable masterpiece. ""Boyz N The Hood"" takes place in South Central, Los Angelas and is the story of 3 boys turning into men. The three friends, Tre, and Ricky and Doughboy, who are half brothers, have to deal with the harsh reality that is South Central and the consequences of their actions. Throughout the whole movie they deal with different choices to make in their lives and the effect of these certain choices. The movie is very touching, depressing, and can teach you a lesson all at the same time.You start out with Tre and some of his friends walking to school, and Tre ends up getting into a fight which lands him at his father's doorstep, due to a written agreement between him and his mother. His father, Furious Styles, tries and successfully teaches Tre to be responsible and teaches him about things he will deal with throughout his life. Ricky and Doughboy, on the other hand, don't really have anybody to teach them the ins and outs of life. This really has an affect on both of them later on in the movie. Doughboy, early in the movie, ends up in the pen at the early age of ten. 7 years pass, and Doughboy returns. It's from here when the story really picks up. It takes you through the daily lives of all 3, with Tre and Ricky trying to get into college and Doughboy hanging out all day on street corners with his friends. Toward the end of the movie, Tre's endurance is definitely put to the test, along with everything his father tought him. The ending is a serious tearjerker, or atleast it was for me. To see what happens, you'll have to rent it.The bonus DVD comes with a few cool extra features. It includes the awesome video ""Growing Up In The Hood"" by Compton's Most Wanted. It also has a nice documentary on the movie. The documentary is lengthy, and very informative on how the movie came about. Audio commentary is included on the first disc, with John Singleton, the director, talking about different parts of the movie. He claims that most of what he used in the movie was taken from his own childhood. Alot that happened in the movie did happen to him, like his father raising him and teaching him about life. The picture is good, the sound is good, everything is brilliantly crafted in the drama. Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, and Morris Chestnut do a good job at portraying Tre, Doughboy, and Ricky. Lawrence Fishburne and Angela Basset also do a good job at playing Tre's mother and father. All of the actors did a fine job at playing their roles.So I say atleast rent the movie, if you're still skeptical about it. It's a great movie, and will definitely keep you in your seat the whole time the movie is playing. Everything is made wonderfully, there's no doubt about it. However, if you're easily offended by racial comments, I don't think you need to watch this movie. Many racial comments are made about Caucasions, so like I said the easily offended should not view this movie. Other than that, this is a great movie that anybody could enjoy. It even adds jabs of humor throughout the movie, which kinda takes away from the drama a little bit.

Many movies try to reflect the daily dramas that are played out in the urban war zones and ghettos of the ""Land of the Free"". ""South Central"", ""Menace to Society"", and several others come to mind. But none of these others can compare to ""Boyz N  The Hood"".First off, you have a great, and talented cast. Fishbourn is terrific in his portrayel of a hard edged father who tries to raise his son right and teaches him to be a man in a harsh world. Cuba Gooding JR is incredible in his performance (despite a few moments of obsurdity) as Tre, the main character, who is the only kid in the hood to have a positive male role model. Ice cube does very good job as ""Dough Boy"" the bad *** of Tre's friends.The story is also very good and is told well. We begin with Tre as a violent and disturbed young child living with his mother, who is then kicked out of his school for beating up other kids. His mother sends him to live with his father. We then see Tre and his friends grow up and dealing with the problems of young adult minorities in an urban environment.There are a lot of emotional parts to this movie and it aproaches the subject manner in a pretty mature fashion meant to impress the desparity of the Ghetto as well as what it's like to try and grow up and survive there.Just like similar movies there is a significant amount of graphic violence, but I look at it as a more realistic depiction of the stories setting and characters. The difference with Boyz N The Hood is that it uses violence in a more responsible way, and there is less of it compared to say ""menace 2 society"". The violence in the movie isn't just thrown in for fun or to show you some violence, but to impact you.Also there is a definate message of consequences of actions and the movie stresses the importence of making good choices, and doing the best you can even if the hand you are dealt isn't the best. In The end Tre prevails and is a good man, despite all the odds stacked against him.This movie really brought tears to my eyes and it was a fabulous, and disturbing look at the problems that America seems to pretend don't exist.

Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Boyz 'N the Hood is a graphic motion picture that deals frankly with the social problems and the unfair, very hard knocks in life people face in the African-American neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles. There are no punches pulled in this film and I do not recommend it for young children. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen and I was totally drawn into the action and plot of this picture; I could feel what the characters were experiencing and that tells me that this picture was done with great care and attention to detail. The plot moves along at a good pace and the cinematography is excellent.The action starts when we meet some young kids. There's ten year-old Tre Styles who lives with his mother Reva Styles (Angela Bassett); and two of his childhood friends are half-brothers Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and ""Doughboy"" (Ice Cube). Tre has an anger problem in school; and his mother decides he should live with his father and her ex-husband Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). Meanwhile, Tre's mother is determined to get better educated and she works hard to successfully leave South Central. Furious Styles, despite his name, is quite a fatherly figure who immediately takes a keen interest in raising his young boy Tre. Furious wants Tre to become a responsible man who can make it out of South Central someday, too. Meanwhile, even at a young age Doughboy is already getting arrested for stealing although Ricky, like Tre, dreams of getting out of South Central by playing professional football.The movie fast forwards seven years; and we find that Doughboy has essentially done nothing with his life--except doing time in prison and hanging out with his buddies on his mother's front porch. Ricky is eagerly anticipating going to USC on a basketball scholarship and Tre works at a mall clothing store while preparing to take the SAT with Ricky and attend college himself.Unfortunately, however, the rough life in South Central deals them some mighty harsh blows; and it becomes apparent that it won't be as easy to get out as Tre and Ricky first hoped. Ricky has to get at least a 700 on his SAT test and Tre has to navigate the waters of starting his first real romance with his high school girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long), the only girl he truly wants to marry. Over all this comes the incredibly strong tidal wave of South Central's drug problems and the gun violence that at times seems to rule the streets without warning. Even a black cop covering the beat is racist against blacks in the neighborhood! Ultimately, Tre, Ricky and Doughboy face some hard choices and what they do to solve their problems provides us with some of the most riveting footage I've ever seen on film.The two DVD release of this movie has a plethora of extras. The deleted scenes are good but the documentary and the commentary with John Singleton were the two best extras in my opinion. You can also choose between widescreen and fullscreen.It's abundantly clear that Boyz `N the Hood will remain one of the best social commentaries for quite some while to come. This film was inducted into The National Film Registry and it deserved it without a doubt. I strongly encourage people who study social issues and sociology to watch this film. When it comes down to it, though, people of all backgrounds should see this film and know just how hard and unfair life can be for some people.",5,strong character development and remarkable acting in a meaningful film,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,3398,"['Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'graphic', 'motion', 'picture', 'frankly', 'social', 'problems', 'unfair', 'very', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'people', 'face', 'African-American', 'neighborhood', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'are', 'punches', 'pulled', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'young', 'children', 'acting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'totally', 'drawn', 'action', 'plot', 'picture', 'could', 'feel', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'experiencing', 'picture', 'was', 'done', 'great', 'care', 'attention', 'detail', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'excellent.The', 'action', 'when', 'meet', 'young', 'kids', 'ten', 'year-old', 'Tre', 'Styles', 'who', 'mother', 'Reva', 'Styles', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'two', 'childhood', 'friends', 'are', 'half-brothers', 'Ricky', 'Baker', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Doughboy', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Tre', 'anger', 'problem', 'school', 'mother', 'should', 'live', 'father', 'ex-husband', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Meanwhile', 'Tre', 'mother', 'determined', 'get', 'better', 'educated', 'hard', 'successfully', 'leave', 'South', 'Central', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'name', 'quite', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'who', 'immediately', 'keen', 'interest', 'raising', 'young', 'boy', 'Tre', 'Furious', 'Tre', 'become', 'responsible', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'South', 'Central', 'someday', 'too', 'Meanwhile', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'Doughboy', 'already', 'getting', 'arrested', 'stealing', 'Ricky', 'Tre', 'dreams', 'getting', 'South', 'Central', 'playing', 'professional', 'football.The', 'movie', 'fast', 'forwards', 'seven', 'years', 'find', 'Doughboy', 'essentially', 'done', 'nothing', 'life', 'doing', 'time', 'prison', 'hanging', 'out', 'buddies', 'mother', 'front', 'porch', 'Ricky', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'going', 'USC', 'basketball', 'scholarship', 'Tre', 'mall', 'clothing', 'store', 'preparing', 'take', 'SAT', 'Ricky', 'attend', 'college', 'himself.Unfortunately', 'however', 'rough', 'life', 'South', 'Central', 'deals', 'mighty', 'harsh', 'blows', 'apparent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'get', 'out', 'Tre', 'Ricky', 'first', 'hoped', 'Ricky', 'get', 'least', '700', 'SAT', 'test', 'Tre', 'navigate', 'waters', 'starting', 'first', 'real', 'romance', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'Brandi', 'Nia', 'Long', 'only', 'girl', 'marry', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'tidal', 'wave', 'South', 'Central', 'drug', 'problems', 'gun', 'violence', 'times', 'rule', 'streets', 'warning', 'Even', 'black', 'cop', 'covering', 'beat', 'racist', 'blacks', 'neighborhood', 'Ultimately', 'Tre', 'Ricky', 'Doughboy', 'face', 'hard', 'choices', 'what', 'do', 'solve', 'problems', 'most', 'riveting', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film.The', 'two', 'DVD', 'release', 'movie', 'plethora', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'John', 'Singleton', 'were', 'two', 'best', 'extras', 'opinion', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen.It', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'best', 'social', 'commentaries', 'quite', 'come', 'film', 'was', 'inducted', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'deserved', 'doubt', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'people', 'who', 'study', 'social', 'issues', 'sociology', 'watch', 'film', 'When', 'down', 'though', 'people', 'backgrounds', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'unfair', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'people']",N/A

10518,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0767811070,Michael Crane,"[42, 45]","If you ever wanted a great example of pure cinema drama at its finest, &quot;Boyz N the Hood&quot; is it.  It didn't take long for me to completely involve myself during the viewing of this film.  It's powerful, sad, scary, and filled with heart.  This is one of those films that completely takes you by surprise by giving you something that you weren't expecting at all.  John Singleton's directorial debut doesn't fail to shine for one second in this human-drama powerhouse.The film focuses around three friends who live in South Central, Los Angeles; a place where drugs, guns, and violence appears to be around every corner.  The three friends are Tre, Ricky, and Doughboy.  Tre's father has tried his best to raise Tre into becoming a real man; supplying him with knowledge and wisdom.  Ricky has dreams of being a professional football player while his brother, Doughboy, is always getting into some kind of trouble, whether it be with the law or the neighborhood gang-bangers.  In the end, the film is about choices and how every action can set off a chain of events.In the exclusive documentary that's included on this 2-Disc Anniversary Edition DVD, John Singleton says that this was the movie he was born to make, and he's able to show us exactly that and nothing less.  Making the movie was taking a pretty big risk, as there was nothing quite like it on the market; however, that didn't stop him from delivering an incredible debut that really stands out from the rest.  The main misconception of this movie is that people are willing to automatically assume that the movie is violent and is only about violence (these being people who have never watched the movie) when in actuality, the film focuses more on the aftermath of violent acts rather than the actual acts being carried out.  The main focus is always on the characters, and Singleton does a superb job of never losing sight of that.  The story is delivered with undeniable care through the great direction of John Singleton.Another factor that makes the film work the way it does is the superb cast behind it.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives it his all early on in his career and immediately shows promise of a talented actor.  Ice Cube proves that not only can he rap, but he can also act by giving life to his character of &quot;Doughboy.&quot;  Laurence Fishburne is amazing as Tre's father, as he gives an outstanding performance.  Everybody else is great as well.  This film really launched many careers of many of the actors that appear in this movie.The 2-Disc DVD edition really does the movie justice as it's loaded with some very cool extras.  The movie looks and sounds great.  The DVD offers both widescreen and full screen versions of the film.  Extras that are included on this 2-Disc Anniversary Edition are theatrical trailers, commentary by John Singleton, an exclusive documentary, music videos, and deleted scenes.  The documentary was fascinating to watch and was extremely informative into what went on during pre and post-production.  Plenty of goodies for DVD enthusiasts all around.&quot;Boyz N the Hood&quot; is a touching and exhilarating drama that plays on all of one's emotions.  The characters are very real and are easy to care for, and the story is well-structured and executed.  I cannot think of a single flaw that I ran across while watching the film.  It definitely has become a new favorite in a short amount of time.  There is real power within the film that has a unique effect on us when we watch it, or at least it did on me.  Definitely a film to check out if you have not already.",5,&quot;They want us to kill ourselves...&quot;,1072310400,"12 25, 2003",2003,3590,"['ever', 'wanted', 'great', 'example', 'pure', 'cinema', 'drama', 'finest', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'completely', 'involve', 'viewing', 'film', 'powerful', 'sad', 'scary', 'filled', 'heart', 'one', 'films', 'completely', 'surprise', 'giving', 'something', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'John', 'Singleton', 'directorial', 'debut', ""n't"", 'fail', 'shine', 'one', 'second', 'human-drama', 'powerhouse.The', 'film', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'place', 'where', 'drugs', 'guns', 'violence', 'be', 'corner', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'Tre', 'Ricky', 'Doughboy', 'Tre', 'father', 'tried', 'best', 'raise', 'Tre', 'becoming', 'real', 'man', 'supplying', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'Ricky', 'dreams', 'being', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'brother', 'Doughboy', 'always', 'getting', 'kind', 'trouble', 'be', 'law', 'neighborhood', 'gang-bangers', 'end', 'film', 'choices', 'how', 'action', 'can', 'set', 'off', 'chain', 'events.In', 'exclusive', 'documentary', 'included', '2-Disc', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'John', 'Singleton', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'born', 'make', 'able', 'show', 'exactly', 'nothing', 'less', 'Making', 'movie', 'was', 'taking', 'pretty', 'big', 'risk', 'was', 'nothing', 'quite', 'market', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'delivering', 'incredible', 'debut', 'really', 'out', 'rest', 'main', 'misconception', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'automatically', 'assume', 'movie', 'violent', 'only', 'about', 'violence', 'being', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'actuality', 'film', 'more', 'aftermath', 'violent', 'acts', 'rather', 'actual', 'acts', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'main', 'focus', 'always', 'characters', 'Singleton', 'superb', 'job', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'story', 'delivered', 'undeniable', 'care', 'great', 'direction', 'John', 'Singleton.Another', 'factor', 'film', 'work', 'way', 'superb', 'cast', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'early', 'career', 'immediately', 'promise', 'talented', 'actor', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'rap', 'can', 'also', 'act', 'giving', 'life', 'character', 'quot', 'Doughboy.', 'quot', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'amazing', 'Tre', 'father', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Everybody', 'else', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'really', 'launched', 'many', 'careers', 'many', 'actors', 'appear', 'movie.The', '2-Disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'really', 'movie', 'justice', 'loaded', 'very', 'cool', 'extras', 'movie', 'great', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'versions', 'film', 'Extras', 'are', 'included', '2-Disc', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'John', 'Singleton', 'exclusive', 'documentary', 'music', 'videos', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'was', 'extremely', 'informative', 'what', 'went', 'pre', 'post-production', 'Plenty', 'goodies', 'DVD', 'around.', 'quot', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'quot', 'touching', 'exhilarating', 'drama', 'one', 'emotions', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'are', 'easy', 'care', 'story', 'well-structured', 'executed', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'single', 'flaw', 'ran', 'watching', 'film', 'definitely', 'become', 'new', 'favorite', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'real', 'power', 'film', 'unique', 'effect', 'when', 'watch', 'least', 'did', 'Definitely', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'not', 'already']",N/A

Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is ""I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job."" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, ""I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too."" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how ""real"" Furious was. ""Young"" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe.

Most people embrace for the portrayal of hood life but only a few people understand why Boyz N The Hood is one of the most important contributions to Black cinema. Boyz N The Hood had a social conscious that is missing from a lot of hood flicks that come out nowadays.The story if you didnt know is about Tre'(Cuba Gooding Jr) being sent to live with his father after he gets in trouble in school. The rest of the film details his experience in South Central Los Angeles.Laurence Fishburne is at his best here. I always thought that he was a great actor and his role here proves it. Furious Styles is a loving father but stern and wise enough to be observant about his surroundings. Cuba Gooding Jr is great as Tre': a somewhat confused but intelligent kid. Ice Cube's best performance next to Fudge in Higher Learning will always be ""Doughboy"". Angela Bassett shines as Tre's caring mother.I like all the gems in this movie like Furious telling Tre' why Black men shouldnt join the army or Furious explaining to the neighborhood in Compton what Gentrification is(hell, most people dont even know what that is now). The stereotypes in this movie are all too real: The mother that loves one son over the other, the biased black cop, the confused black men and women and crack cocaine.

Only twenty-three at the time of the release, he crafted a gripping and revealing film about life in the gang-riddled, hard scrabble streets of South Central Los Angeles.  The movie centers around Tre, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.  Tre lives with his father Furious (Laurence Fishburne), an Afro-centric businessman, who is constantly trying to instill a sense of pride in his son about his culture and his people as well as a respect for life and becoming a real man.  Tre's best friend, Rick (Morris Chestnut), is a star football player being heavily recruited by colleges, but also has a young son.  Rick's brother Dough Boy (Ice Cube in his acting debut) has just served jail time and is a drug dealer who hangs on his front porch drinking 40's and dealing.  The movie is marked with violence as Mr. Singleton shows how on an average Friday night, gunfire can erupt and lives can be lost in an instant.  Mr. Gooding shows signs of greatness as he portrays Tre with a nave and quiet quality, Mr. Fishburne is commanding in his role, but it is Ice Cube who gives the best performance.  With no prior acting experience, he is the heart and soul of the film.  The scene at the end of the film where Dough Boy and Tre are discussing the state of the ghetto is powerful, moving and heart wrenching.  Boyz In The Hood is Mr. Singleton's American Graffiti.  Though it doesn't wax nostalgic like that film, it is Mr. Singleton's ode to his youth and neighborhood and it is a lasting and powerful film.",5,Boyz II Men,1037577600,"11 18, 2002",2002,1553,"['Boyz', 'Hood', 'was', 'John', 'Singleton', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Only', 'twenty-three', 'time', 'release', 'crafted', 'gripping', 'revealing', 'film', 'life', 'gang-riddled', 'hard', 'scrabble', 'streets', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'movie', 'centers', 'Tre', 'played', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Tre', 'father', 'Furious', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Afro-centric', 'businessman', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'instill', 'sense', 'pride', 'son', 'culture', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'respect', 'life', 'becoming', 'real', 'man', 'Tre', 'best', 'friend', 'Rick', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'being', 'heavily', 'recruited', 'colleges', 'also', 'young', 'son', 'Rick', 'brother', 'Dough', 'Boy', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'acting', 'debut', 'just', 'served', 'jail', 'time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'front', 'porch', 'drinking', '40', 'dealing', 'movie', 'marked', 'violence', 'Mr.', 'Singleton', 'how', 'average', 'Friday', 'night', 'gunfire', 'can', 'erupt', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'instant', 'Mr.', 'Gooding', 'signs', 'greatness', 'Tre', 'nave', 'quiet', 'quality', 'Mr.', 'Fishburne', 'commanding', 'role', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'prior', 'acting', 'experience', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Dough', 'Boy', 'Tre', 'are', 'discussing', 'state', 'ghetto', 'powerful', 'moving', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'Mr.', 'Singleton', 'American', 'Graffiti', ""n't"", 'wax', 'nostalgic', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Singleton', 'ode', 'youth', 'neighborhood', 'lasting', 'powerful', 'film']",N/A

I'm just a fellow who grew up in Iowa and lives in North Dakota so I'm hardly one qualified to praise this film for its' realistic portrayal of inner city life.  I don't know if this movie is ""realistic"" or not in that regard.  However, I know that the writer and director had a message to convey and they conveyed it well.""Boyz 'N the Hood"" is about many things.  It is about the challenge of raising a child in a one-parent home.  It is about the senselessness of random, pointless violence.  It is about the limited means of escaping the ghetto as a child growing up in it (and it does an excellent job of contrasting the dependability of education over sports).  It is about the importance of having pride and respect for your self.  There are so many messages on so many levels that it is hard to absorb them all in a single viewing.

I wanted to buy this movie on DVD last year but when I read they had a special 10 year anniversary edition coming out this year.  So I waited and was not disappointed.  I loved the special features which included commentary from the entire cast presently as they all reflected and looked back on the film and what it meant to them.  To look at how much these actors/actresses have blown up since this film, it was quite a door opener for everybody.  From ICECUBE, to Cuba Gooding, Jr., Morris Chestnut, Laurence Fishburne, Angela Bassett, Nia Long, Tyra Farrell, and Darius McCreary (played young Ricky, former star of Family Matters, and Kingdom Come fame), and Regina King.  These are now some of the biggest names in Hollywood right now.  It's started a whole generation of urban reality movies (Juice, Menace II Society, Clockers, etc) that was long missing in Hollywood or just totally ignored by the establishment.  It should be just as important a black film in the 90's as Spike Lee's Do The Right was in the 80's.  Even looking at it now, I enjoy it just as much as when it came out.  Two things I was kind of dissapointed about with this special edition DVD was that it only had two deleted scenes and when they interviewed the guys who played Doughboy, Tre, and Ricky as kids, they never interviewed the guy that played Doughboy.

10529,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767811070,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","The problems of inter-city culture, and what it's like to bea black youth growing up in South Central Los Angeles, is addressed bywriter-director John Singleton in the hard-hitting ""Boyz N the Hood,"" starring Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding Jr.  The story centers on young Tre Styles (Gooding), whose parents are divorced, and as a troubled youth at age ten, is sent by his mother, Reva (Angela Bassett) to live with his father, Furious (Fishburne), in South Central.  The story then jumps ahead seven years, and we find Tre still living with his father.  Furious is a man of principle, a decent man with high ideals, and he's done a good job of teaching Tre how to be a man, and how to survive without slipping through the cracks to become just another statistic from the `hood, without hope of ever amounting to anything.  Furious is the calm in the eye of the storm, navigating a culture steeped in a seemingly never-ending cycle of violence.  Then when Tre is about to graduate from High School, and with his father's  guidance is looking toward college, his best friend is shot and killed.  Tre wants to fight back; and suddenly, he must make the decision that will  determine the path the rest of his life will take.  Singleton  successfully captures the alienation of an entire community from the rest  of the city, and the atmosphere of violence that permeates the lives of all  who live there; the incessant presence of the police helicopters a constant  reminder, lest they forget for even a moment, where they are.  The anguish  of the mothers who fear for the lives of their children, along with the  frustration of the apparent futility of trying to make a change.  In Tre,  Furious, and those close to them, Singleton paints a profound picture of  what life is like for everyone who lives within that few square miles that  is South Central Los Angeles.  A grim portrait, to be sure, yet in the end  he manages to tone it with a positive sign; a glimmer of hope that there  may yet be a light at the end of the tunnel for those born and raised in  the inner-city.  Fishburne gives a dynamic performance as Furious  Styles, the voice of reason and truth amid the turmoil.  He knows who this  man is, and his purpose; and it shows in the subtle command he takes  whenever he is on the screen.  Gooding, too, gives a remarkable  performance, aptly conveying the complexities of young Tre, the pride mixed  with confusion.  The terrific supporting cast includes Morris Chestnut  (Ricky), Ice Cube (Doughboy), Darneicea Corley (Keisha), Tyra Ferrell (Mrs.  Baker), Redge Green (Chris) and Dedrick D. Gobert (Dooky).  Singleton is to  be commended for having the courage to make a truly thought-provoking film.  For this is not a movie about gang-bangers; this is a film that has the  guts to ask important and significant questions objectively, without  copping an attitude.  About the cultural bias of the S.A.T.'s; why there's  a liquor store or a gun shop on every corner in the `hood, and not in  Beverly Hills; and the lack of even the attempt at creating the symbiotic  relationship that would benefit all who live in and around the city of Los  Angeles.  This is an important film that goes far beyond the scope of mere  cinema, and one for which Singleton will be remembered; it is definitely a  movie that should be seen by all.",4,An Important Film From John Singleton,960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,3350,"['problems', 'inter-city', 'culture', 'what', 'bea', 'black', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'addressed', 'bywriter-director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'hard-hitting', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'Tre', 'Styles', 'Gooding', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'troubled', 'youth', 'age', 'ten', 'sent', 'mother', 'Reva', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'live', 'father', 'Furious', 'Fishburne', 'South', 'Central', 'story', 'then', 'ahead', 'seven', 'years', 'find', 'Tre', 'still', 'living', 'father', 'Furious', 'man', 'principle', 'decent', 'man', 'high', 'ideals', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'teaching', 'Tre', 'how', 'be', 'man', 'how', 'survive', 'slipping', 'cracks', 'become', 'just', 'statistic', 'hood', 'hope', 'ever', 'amounting', 'anything', 'Furious', 'calm', 'eye', 'storm', 'navigating', 'culture', 'steeped', 'seemingly', 'never-ending', 'cycle', 'violence', 'Then', 'when', 'Tre', 'graduate', 'High', 'School', 'father', 'guidance', 'looking', 'college', 'best', 'friend', 'shot', 'killed', 'Tre', 'fight', 'back', 'suddenly', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'will', 'determine', 'path', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'Singleton', 'successfully', 'alienation', 'entire', 'community', 'rest', 'city', 'atmosphere', 'violence', 'lives', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'incessant', 'presence', 'police', 'constant', 'reminder', 'forget', 'even', 'moment', 'where', 'are', 'anguish', 'mothers', 'who', 'fear', 'lives', 'children', 'frustration', 'apparent', 'futility', 'trying', 'make', 'change', 'Tre', 'Furious', 'close', 'Singleton', 'profound', 'picture', 'what', 'life', 'everyone', 'who', 'few', 'square', 'miles', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'A', 'grim', 'portrait', 'be', 'sure', 'yet', 'end', 'tone', 'positive', 'sign', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'may', 'yet', 'be', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'born', 'raised', 'inner-city', 'Fishburne', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'Furious', 'Styles', 'voice', 'reason', 'truth', 'turmoil', 'who', 'man', 'purpose', 'subtle', 'command', 'whenever', 'screen', 'Gooding', 'too', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'aptly', 'conveying', 'complexities', 'young', 'Tre', 'pride', 'mixed', 'confusion', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Ricky', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Doughboy', 'Darneicea', 'Corley', 'Keisha', 'Tyra', 'Ferrell', 'Mrs.', 'Baker', 'Redge', 'Green', 'Chris', 'Dedrick', 'D.', 'Gobert', 'Dooky', 'Singleton', 'be', 'commended', 'having', 'courage', 'make', 'truly', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'gang-bangers', 'film', 'guts', 'ask', 'important', 'significant', 'questions', 'objectively', 'copping', 'attitude', 'cultural', 'bias', 'S.A.T', 'why', 'liquor', 'store', 'gun', 'shop', 'corner', 'hood', 'not', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'lack', 'even', 'attempt', 'creating', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'would', 'benefit', 'who', 'live', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'important', 'film', 'far', 'scope', 'mere', 'cinema', 'one', 'Singleton', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'definitely', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

Boyz N tha Hood is a good movie in its own right. The acting is very good. Even Ice Cube who has today been relegated to cheap black comedy and lame action films did a fine job.

The film has an outstanding cast known for breakout roles including: Cuba Gooding, Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long, Tyra Ferrell, and Angela Bassett. Boyz 'N The Hood is an artistic expression and statement about life in modern America. The film follows three different friends and the serious trials and tribulations they must face throughout their lives. In one way or another every American can relate to this film. It is philosophical, violent, stylish, brutal, disturbing, and educational. Some say this film caused violence while others believe it brought the truth to light. The truth is either side could make a strong argument for their belief. The value of Boyz 'N The Hood is that there is an endless amount of possibility for critique.  This film exists and it is powerful and relevant. The main point is that Boyz 'N The Hood attempts to intelligently look at the much larger picture of what is happening in American society today.

10542,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0767811070,Themis-Athena,"[35, 40]","South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer (L.A. Times, January 1, 2004.) Where ""I'll have my brother shoot you"" isn't just an empty threat, and guns are passed from one sibling to another when an older brother goes away to ""do time."" Where owning a gun is a means of self-protection even for those who've always stayed clear of gangs. Where ""where ya' from?"" is an inquiry about gang membership, not geographic origin, and wearing the wrong colors can cause you to be ""hit up;"" resulting in violence, and more violence by way of retaliation. Where over the past 15 years the LAPD has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4 of the city's total - because, as kids learn early, a bullet doesn't come with a name attached; and those who know the killer generally stay mum, either fearing reprisal or preferring to take care of their own, rather than leave justice to a police and a court system they've learned to mistrust. And where crimes like burglary only merit police attention if something actually was stolen, and are quickly sidelined upon the officers' summons to another murder scene.South Central L.A. is the home of Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his friends, ""Doughboy"" and Ricky Baker (Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut). We first meet them at age ten, when Tre's mother (Angela Bassett) sends him to live with his father Jason, a/k/a ""Furious"" (Laurence Fishburne), who seems better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. When we see them again they're seventeen, Tre and Ricky about to graduate from high school, while Doughboy has already graduated - from shoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility, and (self-)respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the wherewithal to steer them out of the ghetto. Yet, Ricky in particular is naively, fiercely resolved to make it out of there; with a football scholarship (provided his SAT scores are high enough) or if that fails, by joining the army. And in a poignant, spot-on conclusion it is ultimately Ricky who forces Tre and Doughboy to choose their own paths in life, to either be drawn into the ghetto's spiral of violence, or conquer their inner demons and extricate themselves from that vicious circle.Upon this movie's 1991 release, several Los Angeles cinemas either refused to show it at all or hired extra security guards: That big, in a city that had recently seen the Rodney King beating, was about to be rocked by the Christopher Commission's scathing indictment of its police department, and was gearing up to the riots that would ravage its inner city the following spring, were fears of the reaction to John Singleton's partly autobiographical film. Yet, while ""Boyz N the Hood"" paints a starkly accurate picture of inner city life's daily realities, it in no way encourages violence - much to the contrary. That it's told from a profoundly ""black"" perspective is a given; and with that come charges that those of us with a more fortunate childhood often dismiss as the chip on many black people's shoulders - e.g., the notion that drugs, liquor and guns in the ghetto are tacitly encouraged by society's white-dominated ruling circles to keep inner-city minorities subdued. But while neither such charges nor their ""white"" response are the be-all and end-all of the problem, there is no question that drugs, alcoholism and guns *are* major issues in the 'hood, as are teen pregnancies and unemployment; and Singleton intelligently weaves all of these elements into a compelling picture.Equally well-deserved as the praise for Singleton, who garnered Best Director and Best Screenplay Oscar nominations and several other distinctions, are the kudos to the movie's outstanding actors. Then-23-year-old Cuba Gooding Jr. came practically out of nowhere to give a fully accomplished, emphatic portrayal as Tre, caught between the lessons of ghetto life and those of his father. (Although this wasn't his first movie, he had never before appeared in a remotely as prominent role.) Morris Chestnut's naively determined football-hero-to-be Ricky is similarly compelling; and Laurence Fishburne noticeably didn't have to reach far for his ""Furious"" Styles: While based on Singleton's father, the role was created specifically with him in mind. So, reportedly, was Ice Cube's Doughboy; and he, too, is a perfect match, giving the teenage trio's most troubled member a depth clearly informed by his own South Central boyhood, although despite his songs' inflammatory lyrics, he himself stayed clear of gangs. Angela Bassett finally is the perfect foil for the movie's male characters, exemplifying a woman who through hard work gets as far out of the ghetto as conceivable and unlike her ex-husband doesn't avoid the moneyed upper-crust, but doesn't forget her origins, either, and is still perfectly capable of talking tough when challenged.The movie's last words are Ice Cube's, both spoken as Doughboy and rapped in ""How to Survive in South Central,"" underlying the closing credits. ""Either they don't know, don't show or don't care what's going on [here],"" Doughboy comments on a TV program about exotic faraway places he's seen shortly after experiencing the kind of violence that he knows will haunt him forever. And in his rap song, sarcastically premised on a guided tour to the ""concrete Vietnam"" South Central L.A. (""Have you witnessed a drive-by? Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready!""), Ice Cube warns: ""Rule number one: get yourself a gun ... 'cause jackers ... love to start [things]. Now, if you're white you can trust the police; but if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts. ... So don't take your life for granted, 'cause it's the craziest place on the planet ... This is Los Angeles."" - ""Boyz N the Hood"" was released 13 years ago.

The rough neighborhoods of America often are ignored by the propaganda of politics and media that focuses more on the positives and successes of American Life, Culture and Society. Singleton's vision in this movie, in a very grounded format is compelling in giving ""Pleasantville America"" a picture of an America that experiences terrorism on a daily basis. It helps explain why there is crime and harshness in these neighborhoods and most importantly clearly delineates the American Government's failure at addressing poverty in the ghettos of America by showing how the cops seem to treat all blacks in the ghetto as if they are animals and not as human beings with compassion.

10546,A9C375HSNCY9,0767811070,Trevor Cotton,"[3, 3]","Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle.  It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) & Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.

Young upstart Cuba Gudding Junior mad a fine performance as did Ice Cube. The only problem with the film is the language is way to overbearing and at times makes the film difficult to watch because of the constant f-bombing in about every other line. The story is great, and the emotions are powerful, as with when i was a child though the girl i went out withs mom had a hissy fit and kept saying if i hear that language again its going off. Well the same could be said now as an adult. But its still great no matter how much you slice it, because especially during the early to mid 90's there was a huge influx in street gangs and extended amounts of violence especially in parts of L.A, and the low lying areas of California.
