838285,A1WSQK3SB76RCC,B0002JP57C,Blake Wood,"[4, 4]","Of all of the Dora the Explorer DVDs, this is my 3 year-old child's very favorite. She loves them all, but for some reason the ""one where Dora turns into a princess"" is really special to her. I guess because all little girls like the whole ""princess"" thing (I'm a daddy, can you tell?). She has the ""Princess Dora"" doll as well (she just got it for Christmas and it is her favorite present).The story is very sweet and it involves Dora and Boots going to Fairytale Land where after a little while they run into a situation where it is up to Dora to make everything allright again. There are several more songs to this one (kind of like ""Dora's Pirate Adventure, which is also a double-length episode featuring a little bit more story and more musical numbers).  If you don't have this particular Dora DVD yet, this is most definitely one to get. My daughter has gone thru several phases where she likes one thing for awhile, and then another, etc. Dora, however, has been the one ""thing"" (for lack of a better word) that has remained tried and true. And I sure don't mind, the show is done really well and she has really picked up a lot from the show, both educationally and morally. I guess we're both big, big fans of Dora the Explorer, and I recommend this DVD very much!",5,"""My little girl's very favorite Dora DVD!""",1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1274,"['Dora', 'Explorer', 'DVDs', '3', 'year-old', 'child', 'very', 'favorite', 'reason', 'one', 'where', 'Dora', 'princess', 'really', 'special', 'guess', 'little', 'girls', 'whole', 'princess', 'thing', ""'m"", 'daddy', 'can', 'tell', 'Princess', 'Dora', 'doll', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'got', 'Christmas', 'favorite', 'present', '.The', 'story', 'very', 'sweet', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'going', 'Fairytale', 'Land', 'where', 'little', 'run', 'situation', 'where', 'Dora', 'make', 'everything', 'allright', 'again', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'songs', 'one', 'kind', 'Dora', 'Pirate', 'Adventure', 'also', 'double-length', 'episode', 'featuring', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'more', 'musical', 'numbers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'particular', 'Dora', 'DVD', 'yet', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'get', 'daughter', 'gone', 'thru', 'several', 'phases', 'where', 'one', 'thing', 'awhile', 'then', 'etc', 'Dora', 'however', 'been', 'one', 'thing', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'remained', 'tried', 'true', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'show', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'lot', 'show', 'educationally', 'morally', 'guess', ""'re"", 'big', 'big', 'fans', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'very', 'much']",N/A
838286,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0002JP57C,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 2]","Dora's Fairytale Adventure is a children's movie based on the popular Nick Jr. program, Dora the Explorer. This movie follows Dora on a long adventure as she sets out to become a true princess and save her best friend, Boots. The film follows a similar theme as the television program: Dora sets out on an adventure from one defined place to another. She asks the kids watching the show to help her, consults her backpack and the Map, and sets out to reach her goal.But this movie also offers a few differences. As anyone who has watched the television program knows, Dora the Explorer almost always completes her adventure with Boots by her side. This time, she must complete the adventure herself because her friend Boots is fast asleep after falling under a spell. And each step of the way, she has to overcome obstacles to get what she needs. Not only must she complete a defined set of tasks, she has a time limit. If she doesn't complete everything in time and become a true princess, Sleeping Boots may never awake.Like the other Dora the Explorer episodes, Dora's Fairytale Adventure offers much educational value. The movie introduces kids to several Spanish words and phrases and Dora asks the viewers to repeat the words back to her. Also, Dora teaches perseverance and positive attitude. It doesn't matter how difficult the obstacle in front of her might be; she is completely confident that she will overcome the challenge. She is self- assured not just in her own abilities, but also in the abilities of the young viewers to help her along the way.Dora's Fairytale Adventure is the main feature of this movie, but it is actually only part of the DVD features. The other half of the DVD includes two more adventures: What Happens Next and The Magic Stick. What Happens Next is a take on the Three Little Pigs story, with Dora and Boots using their imaginations to extend the story and take it in a fresh, new direction. In the Magic Stick, Dora and Boots find a stick that will perform magic, but they have to reach the top of the highest hill in order for it to work. The adventure begins as Dora and Boots seek your help to reach the top of this hill. I found these two DVD extras to be good, but nothing better than I could see if I watched the regular television show with my little girls.In addition to the movie and Extras, there are also several DVD special features and each has something unique to offer. However, they are not all as useful as they could be. My kids liked the sing along, the song selection, and the sneak preview. But the photo gallery was rather boring and the Find the Fairytale Friends Game needs something else added to make it more exciting for kids. Still, it was nice to have so many extras on a single DVD.Dora's Fairytale Adventure is a good movie for preschool age children and most all kids in this age range will love watching the young heroine as she ventures from one place to the next. This movie and the television program not only teach Spanish, they also teach kids many positive traits like persistence and positive attitude. Dora never gets flustered or frustrated in any way, even when the task at hand seems difficult. She just sets out on her adventure and continues to strive until she reaches her goal. She has a few battles along the way in this adventure, with witches, giants, and dragons. But she completes her adventure like always, saving her friend Boots and saving the day for her legions of young fans.",4,"Come on, Vamanos!",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,3476,"['Dora', 'Fairytale', 'Adventure', 'children', 'movie', 'based', 'popular', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'program', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'movie', 'Dora', 'long', 'adventure', 'out', 'become', 'true', 'princess', 'save', 'best', 'friend', 'Boots', 'film', 'similar', 'theme', 'television', 'program', 'Dora', 'out', 'adventure', 'one', 'defined', 'place', 'kids', 'watching', 'show', 'help', 'backpack', 'Map', 'out', 'reach', 'goal.But', 'movie', 'also', 'few', 'differences', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'television', 'program', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'almost', 'always', 'adventure', 'Boots', 'side', 'time', 'must', 'complete', 'adventure', 'herself', 'friend', 'Boots', 'fast', 'asleep', 'falling', 'spell', 'step', 'way', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'get', 'what', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'complete', 'defined', 'set', 'tasks', 'time', 'limit', ""n't"", 'complete', 'everything', 'time', 'become', 'true', 'princess', 'Sleeping', 'Boots', 'may', 'never', 'awake.Like', 'other', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'episodes', 'Dora', 'Fairytale', 'Adventure', 'much', 'educational', 'value', 'movie', 'kids', 'several', 'Spanish', 'words', 'phrases', 'Dora', 'viewers', 'repeat', 'words', 'back', 'Also', 'Dora', 'perseverance', 'positive', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'obstacle', 'front', 'might', 'be', 'completely', 'confident', 'will', 'overcome', 'challenge', 'self-', 'assured', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'abilities', 'also', 'abilities', 'young', 'viewers', 'help', 'way.Dora', 'Fairytale', 'Adventure', 'main', 'feature', 'movie', 'actually', 'only', 'part', 'DVD', 'features', 'other', 'half', 'DVD', 'two', 'more', 'adventures', 'What', 'Next', 'Magic', 'Stick', 'What', 'Next', 'take', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'story', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'using', 'imaginations', 'extend', 'story', 'take', 'fresh', 'new', 'direction', 'Magic', 'Stick', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'find', 'stick', 'will', 'perform', 'magic', 'have', 'reach', 'top', 'highest', 'hill', 'order', 'work', 'adventure', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'seek', 'help', 'reach', 'top', 'hill', 'found', 'two', 'DVD', 'extras', 'be', 'good', 'nothing', 'better', 'could', 'see', 'watched', 'regular', 'television', 'show', 'little', 'girls.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'Extras', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'unique', 'offer', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'as', 'useful', 'could', 'be', 'kids', 'liked', 'sing', 'song', 'selection', 'sneak', 'preview', 'photo', 'gallery', 'was', 'rather', 'boring', 'Find', 'Fairytale', 'Friends', 'Game', 'something', 'else', 'added', 'make', 'more', 'exciting', 'kids', 'Still', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'extras', 'single', 'DVD.Dora', 'Fairytale', 'Adventure', 'good', 'movie', 'preschool', 'age', 'children', 'most', 'kids', 'age', 'range', 'will', 'love', 'watching', 'young', 'heroine', 'ventures', 'one', 'place', 'next', 'movie', 'television', 'program', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'Spanish', 'also', 'teach', 'kids', 'many', 'positive', 'traits', 'persistence', 'positive', 'attitude', 'Dora', 'never', 'flustered', 'frustrated', 'way', 'even', 'when', 'task', 'hand', 'difficult', 'just', 'out', 'adventure', 'strive', 'goal', 'few', 'battles', 'way', 'adventure', 'witches', 'giants', 'dragons', 'adventure', 'always', 'saving', 'friend', 'Boots', 'saving', 'day', 'legions', 'young', 'fans']",N/A

Si!I've watched this DVD for the 50th time with my nephew and I still appreciate how spunky and smart Dora is.  You have to love a series that has titles such as ""Dora Saves the Prince,"" and in this new fairy-tale adventure, Dora must race against time to wake up Sleeping Boots.  As we all know, Boots will drop anything for a banana!  Unfortunately, like Snow White (who appears in the story), he falls fast asleep once he eats a banana enchanted by a wicked witch.  Why is she wicked?  It just seems to go with the archetype.Dora must become a true princess in order to break the witch's spell.  With a little help from her friends Iza, Tico, Benny, Map, and Backpack as well as the denizens of Fairtyale Land, Dora is on her way!
