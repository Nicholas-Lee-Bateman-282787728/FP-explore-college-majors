983147,A31MOOOBHSQLKC,B000F4RHSO,FritzFassbender,"[1, 1]","The death of Raul Julia closed the door to a career still peaking. This film provides one of his great showcases, and fans will savor his powerhouse performance.Taken as a Citizen Kane-type film about a self-made Greek billionaire, this is very entertaining and would be an excellent story. However, as a biography of Aristotle Onassis it falls flat.For starters, Julia looks nothing like Onassis. He's the wrong height, build, nationality, and is certainly much handsomer. Though great to watch, he never is able to convince you that he is Onassis.Supporting cast is unimpressive. Elias Koteas is awkward in his first-act showcase as young Aristotle, and I can't see how Jane Seymour received an Emmy for her overblown performance, while Julia was not even nominated. Francisca Annis fairs better as Jackie Kennedy, but the presentation of Jackie is too quaint for it's own good; all information provided can be found in an encyclopedia entry.Oddly enough, Anthony Quinn as Julia's father looks significantly more like Onassis than Julia, but his hammy appearance indicates why he would not have served well in the main role.Recommended strongly for fans of Raul Julia, everyone else would probably not be interested.",3,"Great showcase for Raul Julia, Despite miscasting",1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,1218,"['death', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'closed', 'door', 'career', 'still', 'peaking', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'showcases', 'fans', 'will', 'savor', 'powerhouse', 'performance.Taken', 'Citizen', 'Kane-type', 'film', 'self-made', 'Greek', 'billionaire', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'story', 'However', 'biography', 'Aristotle', 'Onassis', 'flat.For', 'starters', 'Julia', 'nothing', 'Onassis', 'wrong', 'height', 'build', 'nationality', 'certainly', 'much', 'handsomer', 'great', 'watch', 'never', 'able', 'convince', 'Onassis.Supporting', 'cast', 'unimpressive', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'awkward', 'first-act', 'showcase', 'young', 'Aristotle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'received', 'Emmy', 'overblown', 'performance', 'Julia', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'nominated', 'Francisca', 'Annis', 'fairs', 'better', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'presentation', 'Jackie', 'too', 'quaint', 'own', 'good', 'information', 'provided', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'encyclopedia', 'entry.Oddly', 'enough', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Julia', 'father', 'significantly', 'more', 'Onassis', 'Julia', 'hammy', 'appearance', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'served', 'well', 'main', 'role.Recommended', 'strongly', 'fans', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'everyone', 'else', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'interested']",Onassis: The Richest Man In The World

Watching this current 2-hour version, one can only come to the conclusion that Onassis was interesting only because he was rich, because Maria Callas was his mistress, and because he married Jackie Kennedy. There was no real insight as to how he made his fortune, which would have been much more interesting than a film whose only focus was on Onassis' womanizing. Raul Julia has proven that he is a fine actor with good material (Kiss Of The Spider Woman comes immediately to mind), but he is undone here by a very unimaginative script. Jane Seymour is not bad, though there's nothing here that hints as to why she won an Emmy, and her lip-synching of Callas leaves much to be desired.",2,Unfortunate Truncation,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,877,"['reviewer', 'mentioned', 'version', 'been', 'cut', 'original', '200', 'munite', 'version', 'then', 'could', 'explain', 'why', 'as', 'just', 'shallow', 'made-for-TV', 'bio', 'pic', 'Watching', 'current', '2-hour', 'version', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Onassis', 'was', 'interesting', 'only', 'was', 'rich', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'was', 'mistress', 'married', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'real', 'insight', 'how', 'made', 'fortune', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'only', 'focus', 'was', 'Onassis', 'womanizing', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'proven', 'fine', 'actor', 'good', 'material', 'Kiss', 'Spider', 'Woman', 'immediately', 'mind', 'undone', 'here', 'very', 'unimaginative', 'script', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'not', 'bad', 'nothing', 'here', 'why', 'won', 'Emmy', 'lip-synching', 'Callas', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",Onassis: The Richest Man In The World

I must assume it was not the abreviated version as there was Part I and Part II. Seymour was very good, altho when I saw her in the credits I could not believe she would be playing Callas. Onassis was a short, not too handsome a man and the casting was not good here altho a fine actor, J. is tall and handsome. The contrast between Onassis/Jackie would have been more real with another actor nearer to Onassis' looks/stature...  The Jackie actress was super.Young Onassis had a gay affair with the Turkish soldier for self preservation? Has this been known?I agree the reason for Jackie marrying him was known but well scripted in this movie. I thought Onassis' quote (I assume) that women all marry for money was interesting. In Jackie's case it was a matter of price.She ended up living in NY and without fear.Worth a look. Rent if you can.
