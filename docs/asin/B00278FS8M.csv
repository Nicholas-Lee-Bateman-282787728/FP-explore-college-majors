The first mile is somewhere between 14 and 15 minutes....second one is over 13 but not 14...and the last one is just about at 14 minutes.  Somehow that clock really helps in getting me through the miles.

1253743,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B00278FS8M,Chandler,"[51, 52]","As someone with a large collection of fitness dvds, walking dvds can be either hit or miss. Some can be boring and redundant while others can bring in strangely complicated choreography for something called ""walking""...This hit the bullseye for energy and interest but it actually had a high caloric burn as well!CALORIE BURN: I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn. Because of this, it also enables me to compare the calorie burn of all my workouts as to how many calories they burn not only during the workout, but per minute. I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon measurement rather than perceived exertion...while there is no plyometrics and joint straining moves like ""mountain climbers"", she combines more simple moves with hand movements at a pace fast enough to ensure your heart stays in the target zone and the calories are revved. I didn't feel as though I was worn out, working as hard as when I do my intense aerobics, yet I have to say this burned a LOT of calories in whatever time span you choose to do it. That made it quite impressive because, especially if you've had some days of strength training, this is not hard on your muscles or joints, yet achieves just what it should.INSTRUCTOR: I couldn't put my finger on why I liked this instructor for the longest time and why she seemed different...I think the best analogy I can give is if you watch ""The Biggest Loser"" you see how the trainer Bob seems to not be ""acting"" for the camera or being anything but genuine, yet Jillian does. Often there seems to be some nervousness or ""over the top"" dialogue from trainers on dvds. Instead, this one seemed to be as though you were in a room with a friend who was showing you a routine she does. I can't quite put my finger on how to relay that...other than she seemed like she had done the routine a million times due to her comfort level, yet that she still loved it due to her energy. Often trainers fill up every empty second with words like ""that's it"" ""you've got it"" ""you remember this"" ""You are doing awesome"" etc...this one didn't seem to need to do that...she just spoke comfortably throughout with good reminders of how to do it right as well. Don't get me wrong, she still pushed you and encouraged you but didn't use the words just to fill an empty silence because of not thinking of anything else to say.SET: They kinda went all out for this video...It looks like an upscale studio. 12 foot letters spell out ""walk"" on the back wall, motivational words flash across the screen, there is a big blow up of the instructor with someone on the left wall, you see REAL cars outside a window so you know it's not a set, a clock counts down how far you have walked and lets you know when you have hit a mile or two. Very different. I wondered if she has her own upscale studio and does these routines in this place.MUSIC: Typically in workout dvds you have something made for the dvd that can be a little monotonous and all ""electronica"", but this was more like there was a dj putting on different tracks. Still background music, but it switched it up for interest and it kept it different and the pace of the music also increased as the pace of the steps did.MOVES: When I say this it sounds so boring but I have little attentioin span when I work out, no matter how often I do it, and this is one of the few that kept it up the whole time so I'm trying to get the best wording when I say that it's easy choreography (and when I say ""choreography"" do not think you'll be tripped up once...you won't.) with moves that are all variations of walking...kick backs, knee lifts, grapevine, etc etc with arm movements. You WILL be able to follow her. So much so that she says ""We don't tell you which leg you need to start with. It makes no difference. They both get worked out anyway"" and then she'll say something like ""kick backs"" and it truly doesn't matter which leg you start with.  Her moves are made so that you don't have to rewind to figure out how to ""put the steps together"" or worry about keeping it. Yet it's a true workout. She has really taken the best of routines and made it easy for all to do but still garner great results.WHAT YOU GET:A warm upA brisk 4-5 mph pace of moves that I found funMile Markers in the video celebrate when you've hit your mile mark of choice and allow you to keep going til you doCompound Muscle Movements ensure you hit more muscle groups than regular walkingCool Down WalkStretchbonus ""super sculpt the belly"" floor worktotal running time:53 minutesI think few dvds can take you from beginner to being someone who works out daily and still feel your needs but I think this one can and still keep your interest.If it's your only dvd, I would suggest adding another into your mix with some strength training or a circuit that has a combo of cardio and strength training in order to tighten and tone, but this will offer easy to follow fat burning.NEGATIVES: I wish that she had included more standing ab work rather than limiting it to a different section. This workout will help you lose ab fat and she discusses that often, but there are still some twisting moves that can be done while doing simple walking moves that could further tighten your core as well. This is a minor thing, but no dvd is perfect so I like to cover all bases that someone may look for.CONCLUSION: A good solid workout for any level. Enjoyable, good energy, perfect easy to follow cueing, good calorie burn",5,"Beginners can do it, but fitness buffs will love it & burn loads of calories too",1260576000,"12 12,

1253748,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B00278FS8M,Honest,"[2, 5]","I just rented this from Netflix a couple of days ago and have done it five times because I'm not really sure what I want to rate it.This workout is geared towards abdominal work and for that reason seems to include more moves like knee lifts with the legs open and kicks than usual. It also gets your heart pumping which, as we all know, assists in shedding fat. I started using weighted gloves to try to enhance the workload. Leslie also seems a little chubbier on this video although it could just be her outfit.The first mile is about 14:30, the second is around 13:15 and the last mile is about 14:00. In the third mile, she ""boosts"" the walking for about 60-70 seconds. The music is the same old stuff she's been using for who knows how many years.After the first mile, you'll need your remote because the music fades out and at some points is barely audible; especially with Leslie's gabbing.Another important issue is that the length of the third ""mile"" is questionable. There are three faster songs but none of them are played to completion. The second song (the song she does the boost to) only plays for about 2:30 minutes if that. Then there's an up tempo song I recognize from her 5-mile fat-burning walk and that song is barely played for 2 minutes. When there's still 4:50 left in the mile, she goes into the ""cool down walk"" that is so slow, it's not even funny. Not only that but the entire 4:50 ""cool down walk"" is pretty much completely without cues as Leslie chatters on about how belly fat is bad for you and a bunch of other stuff she's said a million times in her other videos.Leslie should try going all out and not slowing down until the miles are completed and then doing a 3-5 minute ""cool down walk."" People feel cheated when the last ""mile"" is either slower or shorter than the others but is still called a ""mile.""The big problem is Leslie talking. Missed cues, getting out of step (even with arm movements), and even losing the beat a time or two are all things that are present in this workout.Leslie talks so much that she even apparently forgets what she's already said. OK, Leslie, we get it...crunches don't shed abdominal fat. No need to say it in the first mile, twice in the second and again in the third. I've reached the conclusion that she either talks to keep people from getting bored and quitting at midpoint (because her workouts don't have the variety of say a Cathe Friedrich or Patrick Goudeau) or she's the type of person who just can't tolerate silence and has to fill her immediate environment with carbon dioxide at every minute.Anyway, I'm split between a 3 and a 4 rating so I'll go with a 3. Leslie really has to learn how to manage her need to talk or at least learn to talk and maintain coordination at the same time.Oh yeah, as a bonus, when she's about 4 minutes away from the end of the 2nd mile, she apparently has a semi wardrobe malfunction because she's pulling up her pants and then looks into the camera like the cat that ate the canary.",3,Pretty Basic.

I have other Leslie Sansone Walk DVDs and videos and thought I would add to my collection. This workout goes fast, is medium intensity, and has a light stomach workout at the end. Leslie doesn't introduce many new steps, but the moving sidesteps and enhanced walking in one section add variety and intensity. The music is okay, but it gets the job done. Leslie is by herself in this video, which adds a nice change from her other high-intensity workouts. As always, she introduces the basic four steps of her workouts in the warmup and proceeds from there. The walk clock counts the minutes and seconds and helps you get through the video.Leslie combines the stomach workout at the end with the stretching. She does four sets of bicycle crunches and a lying, whole-body stretch on the floor.Overall, this is a good addition to a Walk DVD library and is great when you don't feel like doing high intensity, but need a little more than a 2-mile walk.Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat",4,A Moderate Workout,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1043,"['got', 'DVD', 'sale', 'Kmart', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'other', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'DVDs', 'videos', 'thought', 'would', 'add', 'collection', 'workout', 'fast', 'medium', 'intensity', 'light', 'stomach', 'workout', 'end', 'Leslie', ""n't"", 'introduce', 'many', 'new', 'steps', 'moving', 'sidesteps', 'enhanced', 'walking', 'one', 'section', 'add', 'variety', 'intensity', 'music', 'okay', 'job', 'done', 'Leslie', 'video', 'nice', 'change', 'other', 'high-intensity', 'workouts', 'always', 'basic', 'four', 'steps', 'workouts', 'warmup', 'proceeds', 'there', 'walk', 'clock', 'minutes', 'seconds', 'get', 'video.Leslie', 'stomach', 'workout', 'end', 'stretching', 'four', 'sets', 'bicycle', 'crunches', 'lying', 'whole-body', 'stretch', 'floor.Overall', 'good', 'addition', 'Walk', 'DVD', 'library', 'great', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'high', 'intensity', 'need', 'little', 'more', '2-mile', 'walk.Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', 'Walk', 'Belly', 'Flat']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat

This workout appears to have been filmed about the same time as the workout ""kit"" series that were released this spring and sold exclusively at Target.  Many will be happy to know that this workout is chaptered and you can opt to do the full workout or select an individual mile.  I kind of miss the flow of the unchaptered workouts, as these have a bit of a pause between where one ends and the next starts, but that's a small thing.I liked the pace of the workout and I got mildly sweaty, which is always a good sign.  What is new is the workout clock, which counts down how many minutes/seconds you have left in that mile.  I liked it, although it made me a little too aware of the time.All the standard steps are in the workout - marching, side steps, knee lifts, kicks and hamstring curls - nothing new, but that's fine, as part of the appeal of Leslie's workouts is that you don't have tricky footwork and, as she tells us, you can't do her workouts wrong!  One thing she frequently mentions that I fully recommend you heed is to stand up straight and be careful you don't tip back, particularly when kicking and doing knee lifts.  I think it's a natural tendency to lean back and if you do, you can make your back cranky.  Following her instructions may mean you're not kicking as high, but if you're standing up straight and pulling your belly button in, as she coaches, I think you get a better ab workout.Some of Leslie's cue-ing was a bit delayed, particularly in the beginning, but if you've done any of her workouts in the past, you almost know what she's going to say or do - and even if this is your first, it's truly not a big deal.  I can't say this workout is necessarily any more of a belly reducing workout than any of her others, so the name is a bit of a misnomer, although we won't deduct points :) since she included the 10 minute optional ab workout, which was several sets of the exercise called ""bicycle"" done fairly slowly.Overall, it was an enjoyable workout that moved quickly and worked up a bit of a sweat and will be nice to have in the rotation.",4,Solid Workout,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,2433,"['love', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', '3', 'mile', 'workouts', ""'re"", 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'time', 'workout', 'like', 'have', 'variety', 'choose', 'from.This', 'latest', 'release', '43', 'minute', 'walk', 'props', 'stretch', 'belt', 'weights', 'features', 'Leslie', 'alone', 'sisters', '/friends/instructors', 'workout', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'same', 'time', 'workout', 'kit', 'series', 'were', 'released', 'spring', 'sold', 'exclusively', 'Target', 'Many', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'workout', 'chaptered', 'can', 'opt', 'do', 'full', 'workout', 'select', 'individual', 'mile', 'kind', 'miss', 'flow', 'unchaptered', 'workouts', 'have', 'bit', 'pause', 'where', 'one', 'next', 'starts', 'small', 'thing.I', 'liked', 'pace', 'workout', 'got', 'mildly', 'sweaty', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'What', 'new', 'workout', 'clock', 'down', 'how', 'many', 'minutes/seconds', 'have', 'left', 'mile', 'liked', 'made', 'little', 'too', 'aware', 'time.All', 'standard', 'steps', 'are', 'workout', 'marching', 'side', 'steps', 'knee', 'lifts', 'kicks', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'nothing', 'new', 'fine', 'part', 'appeal', 'Leslie', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tricky', 'footwork', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'workouts', 'wrong', 'One', 'thing', 'frequently', 'fully', 'recommend', 'heed', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'be', 'careful', 'do', ""n't"", 'tip', 'back', 'particularly', 'when', 'kicking', 'doing', 'knee', 'lifts', 'think', 'natural', 'tendency', 'lean', 'back', 'do', 'can', 'make', 'back', 'cranky', 'Following', 'instructions', 'may', 'mean', ""'re"", 'not', 'kicking', 'as', 'high', ""'re"", 'standing', 'up', 'straight', 'pulling', 'belly', 'button', 'think', 'get', 'better', 'ab', 'workout.Some', 'Leslie', 'cue-ing', 'was', 'bit', 'delayed', 'particularly', 'beginning', ""'ve"", 'done', 'workouts', 'past', 'almost', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'say', 'do', 'even', 'first', 'truly', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'workout', 'necessarily', 'more', 'belly', 'reducing', 'workout', 'others', 'name', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'points', 'included', '10', 'minute', 'optional', 'ab', 'workout', 'was', 'several', 'sets', 'exercise', 'called', 'bicycle', 'done', 'fairly', 'slowly.Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'workout', 'moved', 'quickly', 'worked', 'up', 'bit', 'sweat', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'rotation']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat

I am looking to lose weight, get fit and totally take this embarrassing tummy away.

1253763,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00278FS8M,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 2]","I've tried a number of Leslie Sansone walking workouts and this is one of the best. It focuses mainly on low impact walking yet still manages to give you an amazing ab workout. This is a three-mile walk which is best done all at once.During the first mile I didn't notice as much ab work but during the second mile I could really feel my abs working. The third mile has boosted walking (running) so that made it a bit more challenging. I liked that there was a short cool down at the end of the third mile.There is also a nice floor workout which basically consists of bicycle crunches done multiple times with short breaks in between. Finally there is some stretching but nothing extreme. This workout is 49 minutes and will give you an excellent ab workout.Unlike older workouts, Leslie Sansone is alone in her studio. The set is not quite as cheery as other sets so it is more dark and formal. But without other people to chat to Leslie stays more focused and gives you a better workout.~The Rebecca Review",4,A 3-mile Low Impact Workout,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,1009,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'number', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'workouts', 'one', 'best', 'mainly', 'low', 'impact', 'walking', 'yet', 'still', 'give', 'amazing', 'ab', 'workout', 'three-mile', 'walk', 'best', 'done', 'once.During', 'first', 'mile', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'as', 'much', 'work', 'second', 'mile', 'could', 'really', 'feel', 'abs', 'working', 'third', 'mile', 'boosted', 'walking', 'running', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'liked', 'was', 'short', 'cool', 'down', 'end', 'third', 'mile.There', 'also', 'nice', 'floor', 'workout', 'basically', 'bicycle', 'crunches', 'done', 'multiple', 'times', 'short', 'breaks', 'Finally', 'stretching', 'nothing', 'extreme', 'workout', '49', 'minutes', 'will', 'give', 'excellent', 'ab', 'older', 'workouts', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'alone', 'studio', 'set', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'cheery', 'other', 'sets', 'more', 'dark', 'formal', 'other', 'people', 'chat', 'Leslie', 'more', 'focused', 'better', 'workout.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat

The first two miles are fine for me (I'm 65), but the 3rd mile is a little more than I want and pretty fast, so I do my own cool-down after mile 2. I could do mile 3 but I might be sorry; maybe someday. She does various different steps like leg lifts and side steps which are not difficult and vary the workout.  Also the arm motions add to the calorie burn and workout.  People can modify the workout (go slower) and build on that if it's too much in the beginning.  Any moving we do is good, right?

1253772,AO4CDJ583IY55,B00278FS8M,Whitney,"[1, 1]","I bought this workout of Leslie's last month because I wanted to tone up and lose five-to-eight more pounds after losing 35lbs. Five of those pounds I have gained back over the last couple months! Anyway, we had another Leslie DVD that I used to work out to, but it's packed away in storage in a different state.  Since my tummy is my major problem area and amazon.com had such a good price on this DVD, I bought it. I've started with two of the three miles, five days a week, and am working up to two and a half, then three miles. These are not easy miles! Lol. Each mile is more intense, and you're doing that on top of the miles you've already done. But it's great. There are no crazy moves, and you don't have to use anything (i.e. weights, stretch bands, exercise balls, etc.), no expensive machines, just you and whatever you're willing to put into it.I want to buy one or two more of Leslie's DVD's to keep thing changed up and have ordered them from the library to see which ones I like. Of course, I'm on a waiting list, but that's okay, I'll keep working towards that third mile on Walk Your Belly Flat!Now, I have to get my eating back on track. After a year of eating right and losing the weight I wanted to lose, I was finally in the best shape of my, albeit, young life (early 20's), but since a cross country move, it has been hard to maintain a healthy, calorie-counting lifestyle. I enjoy Leslie's encouragement in her routines, and the fact that she is a Christian is important in helping to preserve the right mindset for me.I agree with other reviewers... I wish the backdrop and Leslie's clothes had been brighter like in some older DVD's. I thought I would like having just her, but you find that you miss the interest and stimulation of working out with a ""group"", like the ones that join her sometimes. And the walk clock is definitely cool! I think that should be an option to include on all of her workouts!! : )",4,"Come on, just walk, walk, walk, walk!",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,1938,"['bought', 'workout', 'Leslie', 'last', 'month', 'wanted', 'tone', 'up', 'lose', 'five-to-eight', 'more', 'pounds', 'losing', '35lbs', 'Five', 'pounds', 'have', 'gained', 'back', 'last', 'couple', 'months', 'Anyway', 'had', 'Leslie', 'DVD', 'used', 'work', 'out', 'packed', 'away', 'storage', 'different', 'state', 'tummy', 'major', 'problem', 'area', 'amazon.com', 'had', 'good', 'price', 'DVD', 'bought', ""'ve"", 'started', 'two', 'three', 'miles', 'five', 'days', 'week', 'am', 'working', 'up', 'two', 'half', 'then', 'three', 'miles', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'miles', 'Lol', 'mile', 'more', 'intense', ""'re"", 'doing', 'top', 'miles', ""'ve"", 'already', 'done', 'great', 'are', 'crazy', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'anything', 'i.e', 'weights', 'stretch', 'bands', 'exercise', 'balls', 'etc', 'expensive', 'machines', 'just', ""'re"", 'willing', 'put', 'it.I', 'want', 'buy', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'Leslie', 'DVD', 'keep', 'thing', 'changed', 'up', 'have', 'ordered', 'library', 'see', 'ones', 'like', 'course', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'list', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'working', 'towards', 'third', 'mile', 'Walk', 'Your', 'Belly', 'Flat', 'Now', 'have', 'get', 'eating', 'back', 'track', 'year', 'eating', 'right', 'losing', 'weight', 'wanted', 'lose', 'was', 'finally', 'best', 'shape', 'albeit', 'young', 'life', 'early', '20', 'cross', 'country', 'move', 'been', 'hard', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'calorie-counting', 'lifestyle', 'enjoy', 'Leslie', 'encouragement', 'routines', 'fact', 'Christian', 'important', 'helping', 'preserve', 'right', 'mindset', 'me.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wish', 'backdrop', 'Leslie', 'clothes', 'had', 'been', 'brighter', 'older', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'having', 'just', 'find', 'miss', 'interest', 'stimulation', 'working', 'out', 'group', 'ones', 'join', 'sometimes', 'walk', 'clock', 'definitely', 'cool', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'option', 'include', 'workouts']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat
