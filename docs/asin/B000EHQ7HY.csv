972671,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EHQ7HY,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","Kevin Noland makes a fine debut in both writing and directing this colorful, insightful, low-key exploration of the age old Apollonian Dionysian conflict.  For a first film, despite some minor technical glitches (overexposed photography at key moments, a soundtrack that eats the dialogue before it is audible), Noland proves himself a keen observer of life, of philosophy, and of character studies.  He is definitely an artist to watch.Chris McKinley (Joshua Jackson in yet another fine performance) has just finished college and is ending his summer holiday in Spain with only three days before he returns to an important corporate position in the US. He is traveling with two friends, Ryan (Timm Sharp) and Michelle (Ruthanna Hopper) who are lovers, and they end their holiday in Pamplona, Spain just as the festival of the bulls is happening. Chris' backpack is stolen and with it his passport, credit cards, all semblances of civilization..., and he plunges out of despair into the wildness of the running of the bulls.  He meets two important influences: American expatriate bar owner Riccardo who spouts forth 'live for the moment' concepts, and the beautiful and intoxicating  Adela (Leonor Varela) who embodies all that is fascinating about the beauty of Spain.  The four young people set out on a hike to fly fish, carouse, and live with nature, and this excursion into Spain's gorgeous countryside affects the foursome: Ryan and Michelle decide to part ways and Chris and Adela...well, the story has a fine ending!Noland respects the viewer and offers his tale of discovery with minimal dialogue, some terrific music, exciting footage of the running of the bulls and bullfights, and some hallucinogenic views of nature.  Both Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela light up the screen.  Ruthanna Hopper (Dennis Hopper's daughter) not only acts well, she also has been part of this project since its inception, is one of the producers, and adds a credibility to the story.  So despite the occasional technical flaws, this is a little film of joy, a celebration of discovery the important facts of living.

This movie gives the viewer a good feel for the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, as far as the ever-present nature of the crowds, activities, etc. But, unfortunately the movie overall is listless and meandering. Leonor Varela is marvelous, vivacious, and sexy. She saves the movie. The other acting, apart from Dennis Hopper, is blah. Ruthanna Hopper starts to come alive and then disappears. Joshua Jackson is like a puppy being led everywhere but with no drive of his own. Very little character development. Story line of Americans traveling through Europe forced to make some decisions at their trip's end is good and had potential. But, it was portrayed without conviction. And, give me a break, people in their 20's are alive and passionate with each other. They just don't walk away from a passionate relationship to go walking for a month alone because somebody tells them to. Unbelievable! In real life, the young dude could not have been pried from his new Spanish girlfriend. And, she would not have let him go. With a little more background or character development or twists, this could have been a great movie. But, I have watched it and will now probably give it away.

972673,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000EHQ7HY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I'm not sure what compelled me to seek out ""Americano,"" written and directed by Kevin Noland. It's not as if I was dying to check up on the career of Joshua Jackson, a star of TV's ""Dawson's Creek."" Perhaps I was intrigued by Dennis Hopper's inclusion in such a small scale production--I mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar. Here, however, the lure for him seems to have been his daughter Ruthanna, who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film. Maybe it was international star Leonor Varela, a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in America. Most likely, though, it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of Spain. With great scenery, bull fights, Hemingway, hard drinking and partying, the Running of the Bulls--the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing.However, I am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film. I think Noland has talent and I look forward to other works. The film is photographed well and has good performances. My problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story. With an astounding lack of real character insight, this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat.The setup is simple. As recent college graduates, Jackson and two pals (who bicker comically) are spending the last few days of their vacation in Spain before Jackson must return to the ""real"" world and a new job. Facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood, work and independence, freedom and monotony, dreams and reality--Jackson falls into lust with a local played by Varela. Should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance? Should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure? Should he stay in Spain? These are legitimate questions and a legitimate, albeit familiar, story path. What makes ""Americano"" so tedious and uninvolving, however, is that the film doesn't allow you to know its characters. A character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off--and ""Americano"" doesn't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation. We never know anything about Jackson's job or life in America, or his dreams, passions, interests, etc...aside from this fleeting romance. Sure, the film goes through the requisite motions--Jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of Hemingway, what else would you expect in Spain? If he has artistic aspirations, however, the screenplay surely never develops this. Lacking any real guidance as to what Jackson envisions for his life, I simply fell into the camp of ""who cares?""There are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of Spanish culture. Dennis Hopper's role, however, as a club host is a complete misfire. Ultimately, though, my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth. Sure, Jackson's at a crossroads--but lacking any understanding of what he wants, it made no difference to me what he chose. Sorry, but that's a big problem when it is your film's central theme.

972674,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000EHQ7HY,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 2]","Americanois one of those movies that should be tailor made for me.  I've been to Spain several times, I love traveling, and coming of age films definitely interest me.  I am also more forgiving of slow moving films than most.  I love to watch characters and story elements unfolding beneath the surface.And yet this movie left me wanting so much more.  Instead of slow, imperceptible character changes, we have one-dimensional characters whose motivations are not portrayed or conveyed convincingly, if at all.  The pacing of the movie is brutal.  Rather than a slowly developing drama we get a painfully slow film that feels much longer than it is.  When you consider the star power and talent of this cast, that's pretty disappointing.There are some positives.  The camera work is actually really nice.  And the cinematography really does convey the feeling of Spain and all of the excitement of the *Running of the Bulls* made famous by writers like Hemingway.  All of the actors seem very capable for their roles.  But at times their lines seem in need of re-writes and a few of the takes could have definitely been re-done.*** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD ***Joshua Jackson plays Chris McKinley, a college graduate trekking across Europe with his friend Ryan, played by Timm Sharp, and Ryan's girlfriend Michelle, played by Ruthana Hopper.  The journey is set up as a ""last hurrah"" before Chris has to return home to his stereotypical *dream job*.There are early signs of predictability in the writing.  Chris idiotically gets his backpack stolen with all his crucial documents, which is the kind of easy plot element travel movies are made of. Of course they go to see a bull-fight and there is an extremely forced argument about the brutality of the event versus the tradition.  If you think bull-fighting is brutal, why would you purchase a ticket to go to a bull-fight?Then things take a turn from the predictable towards the cliche as Chris has a beautiful Spanish girl fall into his lap.  Adela, played by Leonor Varela, is a character that is not really fleshed out well with lines, but the actress does give her believability. Yet it's never really convincingly conveyed why Varela's character would even be attracted to Jackson.  It's difficult to see what, if anything, she sees in Chris.  It's hard not to think her instantaneous desire for him is little more than the gratuitous conceit of an American writer.  Contrary to popular belief, foreign women are not lustfully waiting for the American men to arrive.Dennis Hopper's role of Riccardo reaches an even baser level of cliche.  The expatriate American who has somehow acquired a club in the heart of the city seems to have nothing better to do than schooling young Americans on the ways of the world.  Excessively flowery and vague riddles are soon to follow.We are supposed to believe that these romantic characters cause Chris to rethink his life. Yet even with all his talents, Joshua Jackson cannot convey those subtle changes in a character that is written with the dimensions of a blank sheet of paper.We are also supposed to believe that Chris actually starts to re-think his plans of returning home for his career versus staying on to take the *road less traveled*.  Yet I'm sure you can guess the end of this very predictable tale.At one point, Chris stops to watch a street performer and stands there smiling dumbly.  Then without warning, he erases the smirk from his face and moves on.  This scene would be forgettable except that it sums up the sentiment I had with this movie as a whole.  I can kind of smile at the entertaining yet unoriginal story, yet long before it was over I was ready to move on.I really think there might be a very good film hidden in there, but to get to it you would probably have to edit out a few characters and do some major re-writes on certain sections.  I understand the reasons for including the best-friend and girlfriend characters, but they simply don't have enough good lines to warrant inclusion in this story.  In fact they have several poor scenes that weaken the movie instead of strengthen it.  Cutting those characters by itself would have gained this movie an additional star.It's difficult to know how much talent Kevin Noland has based upon this debut.  The easy conclusion to draw is that he may have bitten off more than he could chew.  Perhaps if he would have focused on directing and had a dedicated screenwriter, they could have cleaned up his script a little and added more character development to support his plot line.As with most films, I actually subjected myself to multiple viewings of this just to see if there was something I wasn't giving them credit for.  While this film does have some nice features about it, by and large it is not very effective.  I would not be opposed to watching bits and pieces of it were it ever to air on TV, but this is not a film I can recommend purchasing.Joshua Jackson does well enough with what he is given, but Varela is the real stand-out.  None of it is enough to overcome a story that is not convincing and characters that are as wooden as Riccardo's teeth. Some re-writes or deletions could have made the character development more convincing.This movie may be worth seeing if you love photography and scenic vistas of Spain.  Otherwise, the pacing is so slow that it's hard to really enjoy this movie.Avoid.",2,"Americano - Some Nice Elements, Undermined By Poor Pacing And A Weak Script",1231372800,"01 8,
