The synopsis made me think &#8216;Father of the Bride&#8217;, which I adored (the 1950&#8217;s version), but I also knew that it was adapted from a Paddy Chayefsky teleplay, and well he that doesn&#8217;t exactly scream &#8216;cheery&#8217;.  What I got was like a darker version of the same story, if &#8216;Father of the Bride&#8217; was written from a purely depressed and unsettled point of view.  The film is anchored by some really strong performances, with both Davis and Borgnine grounding the film in their heartbreaking backstories, and Reynolds adding a layer of life to her &#8216;frustrated daughter&#8217;.  Fitzgerald is great for some comic relief, but this film is far from a comedy.  Dealing with real human themes like love, marriage, financial obligations and the fear of proving a poor parent, &#8216;The Catered Affair&#8217; is rich with merit.  Borgnine&#8217;s internal frustrations coupled with Davis&#8217;s brilliantly layered take on a mother at the end of her rope create a perfect pair, and the finale couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate.

290634,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,6302010993,Ben,"[1, 2]","Bette Davis love Loved LOVED her role of ""Aggie (Agnes) Hurley"".  Fair enough.  It's a good role.  Davis plays a Bronx wife (Bette Davis in the Bronx?) married to Ernest Borgnine, in a rather good role as a harried cab driver.  Husband and wife live in a tenement building with their daughter (Debbie Reynolds, of all people to play their daughter), and son (some wickedly gay guy whose name escapes me).But Deb and her betrothed have the use of this car of a couple whose wife is pregnant and the rumors start flying.  In this day and age, no one would care.  But for a woman like Agnes Hurley, it's a huge thing.  Rumors abound.Anyway.  Debbie is getting married and Mama Bette wants to give her daughter a proper wedding, with all the bells and whistles.  Papa Ernie is in shell-shock at the expense.  Daughter Debbie says ""oh we don't want anything"" and also has to placate her friends who have NOTHING.  It's all a big mess.  Add Barry Fitzgerald as a drunken Irish uncle (were there any other in these films?) with a girlfriend.  He lives with Bette and Ernie.It's a mad state of affairs but, most importanly, it is a SAD state of affairs that eventually fall onto the already strapped tenement roof of the Hurley household.While it may be odd to consider Davis and Borgnine as husband and wife, they play very, very well together and this one scene, where Davis weeps, that is stunning.A great movie?  Not by a long shot.  If the script had done more for Davis and Borgnine, I'd give if five stars.  But their problems and stations in life, and reacting to same, give the film the only solidity that it has.  Without Davis and Borgnine, the filme would have sunk.  As it is, it floats.

A fancy wedding will wipe out the family's meager savings and husband Tom's (Ernest Borgnine's) dream of buying his own taxicab business. But Aggie sees only the wedding she never had and the need to impress others.

And it is similar to Chayefsky's Marty, which won Oscars in 1955 for him and Borgnine.

290636,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6302010993,Classic film buff,"[2, 2]","In the 1950's the fledgling television industry not only threatened to lure audiences away from motion pictures, but also was attracting fresh, stimulating writing talent such as Gore Vidal, Rod Serling, JP Miller and of course Paddy Chayefsky who first sprang to national prominence with the teledrama ""Marty"".  He followed this success with ""The Catered Affair"" which was originally televised in May 1955 on the ""Philco Television Playhouse"" starring the incomparable Thelma Ritter.  ""Marty"" was adapted to the big screen and wound up winning Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor - Ernest Borgnine for 1955, and more importantly took in a nice haul at the box office.  Under the circumstances it was only natural that Hollywood would adapt ""The Catered Affair"" to the big screen next.The story is set in the Bronx at the present time (1956), and concerns the Hurleys, a lower middle class Irish-American family.  Tom Hurley (Ernest Borgnine) is a middle-aged cab driver whose big dream is to someday own his own taxi.  His wife Aggie (Bette Davis) is a housewife pretty well resigned to the drabness of her existence.  They live in an apartment building with their two children, Jane (Debbie Reynolds) and Eddie (Ray Stricklyn) plus Aggies's older bachelor brother Jack Conlon (Barry Fitzgerald).  Jane's announcement that she is going to marry her steady boyfriend Ralph Halloran (Rod Taylor) in the next several weeks in a quiet, simple ceremony with just the immediate family, (no she's not pregnant!), causes a major disruption.  Aggie torn between guilt at not doing enough for Jane growing up and pride at wanting to keep up with the groom's more affluent parents wants a big fancy catered wedding.  Neither Jane nor Ralph wants it, and Tom is horrified this will wipe out their hard earned savings. Despite this, Aggie plows forward doggedly determined to do what she thinks is right until events finally come to a head and the inevitable family explosion occurs.This slice of life or kitchen sink type of drama was a departure for the MGM studio whose product usually had a more glossy finish.  Realism is the key here, the sets, costumes, locales all look very true to the milieu of the working class Bronx of this era, very plain and worn and photographed in stark black and white.  Surprisingly, Paddy Chayefsky didn't do the screenplay but rather Gore Vidal, an odd choice since his patrician WASP background was totally alien to that of the characters in the film, yet he does capture the idiom, the flavor of the speech and thought process.Tom and Aggie lead what Thoreau called ""lives of quiet desperation"", as many people did then and sadly still do.  Neither is happy with their lot in life and both Davis and Borgnine work well at bringing this out, this couple worn down by poverty and drudgery both just going through the motions of marriage.  Believing either of them as lower class Irish Americans was a little bit of a stretch though, and Davis' acquired Bronx accent every once and awhile betrays the cadences of New England.Debbie Reynolds as the bride to be Jane is the revelation in this film, firmly leaving behind the arch, cutesy, ing&eacute;nue mannerisms of prior films and turning in a finely honed low-keyed dramatic portrayal that was a giant step forward in her development as an actress.  It was worthy of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar Nomination if not the actual award itself.  She is well matched by Rod Taylor as Ralph Halloran her bespectacled fianc&eacute;, a very likeable, easygoing, bright young man.  They make a most appealing couple, quite suited for one another and unlike Jane's parents this will not be a marriage of convenience, they truly love one another, the odds are this marriage will be a success.  They share several very good scenes together but there is one especially well played where they are in Ralph's one room apartment. First they are talking but then wind up kissing on the bed and their desire for each other builds accented by Andre Previn's simmering musical score, then ebbs away as they regretfully break the mood and decide to go to the movies as planned.The other notables in the cast are Barry Fitzgerald as Jack Conlon, Aggie's fussy, hypochondriac bachelor brother and Dorothy Stickney as Mrs. Rafferty, his close card-playing companion.  His thick Irish brogue is explained away by the fact that he was born in Ireland whereas Aggie was born in America.  At first annoying with his querulous ways, Jack becomes more human and likeable in the last part of the film, when he finally makes some positive adult decisions.  As the sprightly widow, Mrs. Rafferty, who plays her cards right in more ways than one, Dorothy Stickney has a nice little twinkle in her eyes.  Robert Simon and Madge Kennedy give good support as Ralph's upwardly mobile parents the Hallorans as does Joan Camden as Jane's woebegone best friend Alice.The director Richard Brooks did a craftsman like job in putting all the elements together and making them work.  I particularly liked Andre Previn's musical score, which has elements of Irish themes that complemented the Hurley family background.At the movie's conclusion there is a hopeful sense of resolution, now that the air has been cleared between Tom and Aggie.  Life will go forward with the two of them getting to know one another all over again, and perhaps finding some measure of contentment and hopefully love.  While not an extraordinary movie, it is I feel a true one that is rooted in reality.  The Hurleys are common, ordinary folk but in their basic flawed humanity, the wish to achieve the American dream for their children and themselves, and the often frustrating quest for a better way of life we can all recognize something of ourselves.",4,"""Mad?

Allen,"[0, 0]","""The Catered Affair"" (1956) Is Wonderful....Acting, Writing, Direction...Wall-To-Wall Quality Thru and Thru!Bette Davis stated this movie was the best she ever did, and her favorite. I can see why.I'm a collateral relative of Bette's (also of 8 other famous movie actors, FYI), and have studied her career.She did this movie before the strange horror movies she did in the 1960's (e.g ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"" etc.), way before she acted in ""The Whales Of August"" (1967) old ladies waiting to die movie with Lillian Gish, who was over 90 in 1987.But in 1956, Bette Davis wasn't yet doing freak, or unusually old age character movies. She was still normal. Depicted as married to Ernest Borgnine (a fellow Best Actor Academy Award winner), depicted as then young Debbie Reynolds' mother....letting Debbie know at the start of the movie that marriage is no joy ride (how true, how true....I was married 3 times.....well, the first week all 3 times as a joy ride, but after that...? Damn!)Bette Davis, Debbie Reynolds, Ernest Borgnine, Barry Fitzgerald, Rod Taylor, screenplay by Gore Vidal based on a Paddy Chaevsky play.....all presented only one year after Chaevsky's and Borgnine's triumph with ""Marty"" (1955) starring Ernest Borgnine, who won the Best Actor Academy Award for that movie.Both Gore Vidal and Ernest Borgnine passed away recently in 2012, almost 60 years after the 1956 ""Catered Affair"" movie was released.Wonderful Bette Davis is long gone by now, then young, sweet Debby Reynolds is now past age 80.......These incredible people were part of s simple black and white movie about working class Irish-Americans in NYC in the early 1950's worth seeing and worth thinking about.Movies like this one, based on stage plays, show off good acting and thoughtful ideas.....gimmicky visuals and other eye candy are not the main thing......the actors and the writing, and the ideas of the gifted authors (Chaevsky and Vidal here) carry the whole thing, with the help of understated but still highly skilled direction (Richard Brooks directed this movie, and did a great job).My breath is taken away.SEE this old movie, Americans and others living in 2012 and beyond.It sets a standard almost never achieved in the present era. It was done, created in a Golden Age now past by people mostly angels by now, or soon to be.-----------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor",5,"""The Catered Affair"" (1956) Is Wonderful....Acting, Writing, Direction...Wall-To-Wall Quality Thru and Thru!",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2408,"['Catered', 'Affair', '1956', 'Wonderful', '.Acting', 'Writing', 'Direction', 'Wall-To-Wall', 'Quality', 'Thru', 'Thru', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'stated', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'did', 'favorite', 'can', 'see', 'why.I', ""'m"", 'collateral', 'relative', 'Bette', 'also', '8', 'other', 'famous', 'movie', 'actors', 'FYI', 'have', 'studied', 'career.She', 'did', 'movie', 'strange', 'horror', 'movies', 'did', '1960', 'e.g', 'What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'etc', 'way', 'acted', 'Whales', 'August', '1967', 'old', 'ladies', 'waiting', 'die', 'movie', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'who', 'was', 'over', '90', '1987.But', '1956', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'doing', 'freak', 'unusually', 'old', 'age', 'character', 'movies', 'was', 'still', 'normal', 'Depicted', 'married', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'fellow', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'depicted', 'then', 'young', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'mother', '.letting', 'Debbie', 'know', 'start', 'movie', 'marriage', 'joy', 'ride', 'how', 'true', 'how', 'true', '.I', 'was', 'married', '3', 'times', '..well', 'first', 'week', 'all', '3', 'times', 'joy', 'ride', 'Damn', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'screenplay', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'based', 'Paddy', 'Chaevsky', 'play', '..all', 'presented', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'Chaevsky', 'Borgnine', 'triumph', 'Marty', '1955', 'starring', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie.Both', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'passed', 'away', 'recently', '2012', 'almost', '60', 'years', '1956', 'Catered', 'Affair', 'movie', 'was', 'released.Wonderful', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'then', 'young', 'sweet', 'Debby', 'Reynolds', 'now', 'past', 'age', '80', '.These', 'incredible', 'people', 'were', 'part', 's', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'working', 'class', 'Irish-Americans', 'NYC', 'early', '1950', 'worth', 'seeing', 'worth', 'thinking', 'about.Movies', 'one', 'based', 'stage', 'plays', 'show', 'off', 'good', 'acting', 'thoughtful', 'ideas', '..gimmicky', 'visuals', 'other', 'eye', 'candy', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'thing', 'actors', 'writing', 'ideas', 'gifted', 'authors', 'Chaevsky', 'Vidal', 'here', 'carry', 'whole', 'thing', 'help', 'understated', 'still', 'highly', 'skilled', 'direction', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'directed', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', '.My', 'breath', 'taken', 'away.SEE', 'old', 'movie', 'Americans', 'others', 'living', '2012', 'beyond.It', 'sets', 'standard', 'almost', 'never', 'achieved', 'present', 'era', 'was', 'done', 'created', 'Golden', 'Age', 'now', 'past', 'people', 'mostly', 'angels', 'now', 'soon', 'be.', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG-AFTRA', 'movie', 'actor']",N/A

Bette is never boring, even when she is in a second rate film. Luckily, this film is absolutely first rate, with really affecting performances by Davis, Borgnine, Fitzgerald, Taylor, and Reynolds (she is really special here).The production is an American ""kitchen sink"" era drama based on a teleplay by Paddy Chayevsky, about a hard-working cab driver, who manages to save some money for his dream of owning his own taxicab. Unfortunately his realization of his dream collides with his wife's surprising need to throw their daughter a wedding to impress friends, family and mostly her future inlaws. The ""catered affair"" Davis plans threatens to wipe out all of Borgnine's savings, and alienate her daughter's fiance. Once Davis realizes that executing the catered affair  will not makeup for her terrible memories of her own humiliating wedding, or elevate the dignity of her grinding working class existence, or makeup for her emotional neglect of her daughter, she gives up the scheme to everyone's collective sigh of relief.Davis gives a stunning performance as a trod upon housewife who tries to rear her head for once in  her depressing marriage. Although made just 6 years after ""All About Eve,"" Davis looks at least 15 years older than Margo Channing in that film. She can play anything and make it believable - what an actress. We are lucky that she fought to be so prolific. Borgnine really shows  his  ability as a dramatic actor as the disapointed husband who has worked hard his  entire marriage and has not been much appreciated for his efforts, Debbie Reynolds is  wonderful as their daughter who is trying to juggle her mother's dreams with her fiance's practical wedding plans, and her  father's fury at the expense of the  catered affair. And finally, casting Barry Fitzgerald as Davis' confirmed bachelor  brother who lives with her family was a stroke of genius.

Bette Davis, Ernest Borgnine, Barry Fitzgerald, Debbie Reynolds, and Rod Taylor make up the superlative cast.This slice of life drama focuses upon a lower, middle class Bronx family, headed by Tom Hurley (Ernest Borgnine), a cab driver, and his wife, Aggie (Bette Davis). Their daughter, Jane (Debbie Reynolds), has just announced that she is getting married, but that she and her fiance (Rod Taylor) want no formal wedding reception.Aggie soon insists upon giving her daughter the wedding she never had, which promises to wipe out their entire paltry savings, as well as Tom's dream of owning his own taxi medallion. Aggie's plans are the catalyst for some much needed family changes.Barry Fitsgerald is wonderful as Aggie's bachelor brother, who has been living with the Hurleys for many years. Jane's impending nuptials and Aggie's plans make him take stock of his own life. Aggie and Tom are also forced to take stock of their own relationship with each other. This is a character driven, rather than plot driven, film.The sets are wonderfully dreary, setting the stark tone for the claustrophobic, narrow lives lived by the characters. Bette Davis is terrific as the wife and mother who lives a life unexamined, until her daughter's own life change forces her to look at what she has. Ernest Borgnine is excellent as the taciturn father and husband, who knows his limits, but has his dreams. Aggie's and Tom's lives appear to have been running on parallel tracks until Jane's leaving home forces them to choose between going on as they had, in dreary loveless, isolation or forming a commom bond and one track upon which they will ride together.

290647,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,6302010993,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[1, 4]","Bette Davis glumly acts her way through this working class-soap opera by Paddy Chayevsky, whose inherent misogyny undercuts his social realist message. Davis plays Agnes Hurley, a poor, but socially ambitious woman in the Bronx married to Tom, a decent, but not too bright, cabbie. The title ""A Catered Affair"" refers to the elaborate wedding she's planning for her daughter Jane, even though it will wipe out their life savings. But Jane defies her mother and decides on a private wedding and adding insult to injury, her bachelor brother Jack decides to marry his sweetheart. Both Jane's and Jack's weddings, and their personal happiness, force Agnes to face the barren emotional life she shares with Tom. Agnes is portrayed as domineering and unloving--her longing for more excitement and class respectability in her drab life is treated as a form of selfishness, if not depravity. ""I guess you'll be doin' housework soon, too,"" she sourly says to her daughter, as Jane walks out the door with her fiancee. Jane may think her life will be different from her mother's, but we know she'll be in for a rude surprise.Like so many other leftist male writers of the fifties, Chayevsky's socially progressive ideas didn't extend to the lives of women. Could Agnes' dissatisfaction have to do with the fact that she's obviously an intelligent woman with nothing to do all day stuck in dreary apartment married to a man who isn't very bright? Sure, Tom's a decent guy, but doesn't she have a right to expect more? If this were a story by Edna Ferber, Agnes would have taken the money she saved for Jane's wedding and started her own catering business and made millions. She would have set up Tom in his own limousine service. But no, in the film's depressing ending, Agnes has a ""change of heart"" and decides to dedicate her life to mothering her sweet, but dimwitted husband.Left-wing films like this made during the fifties are actually more reactionary than the glitz turned out by Hollywood studios. Actresses like Doris Day and Judy Holliday played working-class girls unwilling settle for lives like Agnes'. No wonder audiences flocked to see them and gave films like Chayevsky's the brush-off.  And in real life, Bette Davis herself would never have accepted the dreary life Agnes resigns herself to by the end of the film. Why Davis thought it was her best film is beyond me.

290652,A1FCBJNIFF4PPU,6302010993,prairie woman,"[3, 3]","This movie was made in 1955 but the theme of wanting to have the wedding of a lifetime parallels today.  Ernest Borgnine and Bette Davis play the dad and mom of Jayne,(Debbie Reynolds) who wants to marry her sweetheart(Rod Taylor) in a very simple ceremony.  Seems very practical since her folks live modestly and dad drives a cab on the night shift.  His dream also after many years of saving is to buy his own cab.  After hearing comments from local gossips about Jayne's wedding being done in a hurry, and ""is she in trouble"", the game plan changes.  Not only that the bachelor uncle, played by a delightful Barry Fitzgerald is offended because he's not invited.  Aggie(Davis) proceeds to dig into the family savings and give her daughter the wedding that Aggie never had.  ""We owe it to her"", is the logical answer.  The plans soon turn into a nightmare and feelings are hurt, anger mounts, the young couple argue, and dad sees his financial future come to a halt because he can no longer afford to own his cab.Debbie Reynolds as Jayne does a credible job playing a young working gal trying to be the negotiator in a family where there is hostility and a lack of communication between parents who continually harass one another.  She displays a lot of emotion and one really finds empathy with her as she tries to fulfill her mother's wishes and at the same time not offend her best friend who can't afford the dress of the matron of honor.  It's heartbreaking to watch.Bette Davis is a master at any role that she's been in.  And in this one she should've won an academy award.  The character of Aggie is rough around the edges--she says what she thinks.  There's not much love or affection shown to her husband much less to her son and daughter. It's all about her.Ernest Borgnine  as the dad  really shines as the overworked, unappreciated member of the household who gets only negative feedback from his wife.  He reluctantly goes along with what she wants to keep the peace.  The scene in the kitchen when he attempts to explain why he can't go into a partnership with his fellow cab driver is so compelling.  One almost feels a part of the scene--it's so real.Rod Taylor as the prospective groom also does a commendable job as the guy who won Jayne's heart and is out to make her happy.  Since this is the 1950's the scene of them sharing passionate kisses in his apartment is precious.  ""I think we'd better go to the movies"" is the final comment by Jayne.The rest of the cast were not familiar actors, but the casting was well done--the parents of the groom, the nosy neighbor, Jayne's brother were all good in their roles.  I almost felt like part of the family.",5,A Wedding To Be Remembered!,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2675,"['movie', 'was', 'made', '1955', 'theme', 'wanting', 'have', 'wedding', 'lifetime', 'parallels', 'today', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'play', 'dad', 'mom', 'Jayne', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'marry', 'sweetheart', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'very', 'simple', 'ceremony', 'very', 'practical', 'folks', 'live', 'modestly', 'dad', 'cab', 'night', 'shift', 'dream', 'also', 'many', 'years', 'saving', 'buy', 'own', 'cab', 'hearing', 'comments', 'local', 'gossips', 'Jayne', 'wedding', 'being', 'done', 'hurry', 'trouble', 'game', 'plan', 'changes', 'Not', 'only', 'bachelor', 'uncle', 'played', 'delightful', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'offended', 'not', 'invited', 'Aggie', 'Davis', 'proceeds', 'dig', 'family', 'savings', 'give', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Aggie', 'never', 'had', 'owe', 'logical', 'answer', 'plans', 'soon', 'turn', 'nightmare', 'feelings', 'are', 'hurt', 'anger', 'mounts', 'young', 'couple', 'argue', 'dad', 'sees', 'financial', 'future', 'come', 'halt', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'own', 'cab.Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Jayne', 'credible', 'job', 'playing', 'young', 'working', 'gal', 'trying', 'be', 'negotiator', 'family', 'where', 'hostility', 'lack', 'communication', 'parents', 'who', 'continually', 'harass', 'one', 'lot', 'emotion', 'one', 'really', 'empathy', 'fulfill', 'mother', 'wishes', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'offend', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'dress', 'matron', 'honor', 'heartbreaking', 'watch.Bette', 'Davis', 'master', 'role', 'been', 'one', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'character', 'Aggie', 'rough', 'edges', 'what', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'affection', 'shown', 'husband', 'much', 'less', 'son', 'daughter', 'her.Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'dad', 'really', 'overworked', 'unappreciated', 'member', 'household', 'who', 'only', 'negative', 'feedback', 'wife', 'reluctantly', 'along', 'what', 'keep', 'peace', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'when', 'explain', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'partnership', 'fellow', 'cab', 'driver', 'so', 'compelling', 'One', 'almost', 'part', 'scene', 'so', 'real.Rod', 'Taylor', 'prospective', 'groom', 'also', 'commendable', 'job', 'guy', 'who', 'won', 'Jayne', 'heart', 'out', 'make', 'happy', '1950', 'scene', 'sharing', 'passionate', 'kisses', 'apartment', 'precious', 'think', ""'d"", 'better', 'go', 'movies', 'final', 'comment', 'Jayne.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'actors', 'casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'parents', 'groom', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'Jayne', 'brother', 'were', 'good', 'roles', 'almost', 'felt', 'part', 'family']",N/A

290657,A2TU3RO6244TZ2,6302010993,Stargazer,"[1, 1]","At long last, The Catered Affair - a black and white fifties drama - is out on DVD and remastered.Gore Vidal wrote the script, and Richard Brooks directed.The story is set in the Bronx,in a down at heel apartment where the Hurley family live. Jane Hurley (played with sensitivity by a 24 year old Debbie Reynolds) arrives home from work and informs her parents that she and Ralph Halloran (Rod Taylor) have decided to get married, with no fuss,expense, and just their two immediate families present.The news is met with understated happiness by her parents,Agnes and Tom (Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine.)Tom is a taxi driver who works nights and rarely sees his family, and Aggie is the family ""engine,""driving everyone on to be better and do better. Her brother Jack Conlon, played with typical audacity and rat cunning by Barry Fitzgerald,rents a room from them, which leaves only the kitchen as a place all the family can sit together in.The wedding is set for a few weeks away,and Ralph's parents are invited over to dinner to meet the Hurley's who have explained to Jack that day that only the immediate family will be attending the wedding. Jack is outraged that he is not on the guest list, but as Aggie explains to her brother,they have numerous other siblings who would be offended if Jack was invited but not them.The Hallorans arrive to meet the family, Jack is out with his lady friend,so the room he knows as his bedroom has been hastily converted into a dining room/sitting room for entertaining the guests. The Hallorans appear comfortably off with Mr Halloran only too ready to brag about his business prowess and the big send offs for his daughters on their wedding days - paid for by him. He is prepared to help his son and daughter inlaw-to-be financially,which embarrasses and rankles the Hurleys, and soon Aggie is committing the family finances to something they can't afford, just so they will be seen doing right by their daughter.Tom Hurley has been saving for 12 years to scrape together enough money to buy a cab with his friend. Both men need $4,000 each to buy a new cab and licence from a driver about to retire. This is the money that Aggie is pledging to spend on a big wedding (at one stage she orders 10 limosines to take their complete family to the reception in grand style).In the midst of all this anxiety and shame,arrives Jack,who has been making his own arrangements with his lady friend, Mrs Rafferty. He's a wee bit under the weather, and after informing Mrs Halloran the sofa she is sitting on is his bed,his barely concealed anger at his earlier argument with his sister,Aggie, mixed in with his naturally mischievousness encourages the Hallorans to bid a hasty good night.The relationship between Aggie and Tom is strained. He is silent,glowering,moody,trying hard to be a good provider, and resenting the lack of attention his wife gives to him. When Jack announces he is marrying and moving in with Mrs Rafferty, Tom explodes at the suggestion that someone else might take Jack's room.For the first time in their married life,Mr and Mrs Hurley will be on their own,as their daughter is getting married and their son joining the army,(their elder son was killed in Korea several years earlier),and Uncle Jack has moved out,too.On the morning of the wedding, Aggie allows her husband to sleep after his night shift until the last minute,and irons his shirt and presses his suit, then sits by him and waits patiently for him to wake up. This is a new day, a new start,and rediscovered respect between them,leaving us with the feeling that they will get to know each other, and enjoy their new lives.Bette Davis - probably the biggest female star of them all in Hollywood's ""Golden Years,""was a great actress given to playing roles (as did Crawford,Shearer etc)that were overly dramatic and thus difficult for later generations to get their teeth into. She wanted to work, and was so desperate for roles she advertised herself in the Variety and other papers. She struck gold with All About Eve and then again in the Catered Affair. The star had turned herself into a first rate character actress. A wonderful portrayal of poverty and hardship, trying to make ends meet, and doing one's best. Ernest Borgnine was perfect as the gentle battler with the sensitive soul, and Debbie Reynolds really surprised with the depth of her performance - a fine effort.",5,The Embarrassment of Poverty,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,4400,"['long', 'last', 'Catered', 'Affair', 'black', 'white', 'fifties', 'drama', 'out', 'DVD', 'remastered.Gore', 'Vidal', 'wrote', 'script', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'directed.The', 'story', 'set', 'Bronx', 'down', 'heel', 'apartment', 'where', 'Hurley', 'family', 'live', 'Jane', 'Hurley', 'played', 'sensitivity', '24', 'year', 'old', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'home', 'work', 'parents', 'Ralph', 'Halloran', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'have', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'fuss', 'expense', 'just', 'two', 'immediate', 'families', 'present.The', 'news', 'met', 'understated', 'happiness', 'parents', 'Agnes', 'Tom', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Tom', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'nights', 'rarely', 'family', 'Aggie', 'family', 'engine', 'driving', 'everyone', 'be', 'better', 'do', 'better', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Conlon', 'played', 'typical', 'audacity', 'rat', 'cunning', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'room', 'only', 'kitchen', 'place', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'together', 'in.The', 'wedding', 'set', 'few', 'weeks', 'away', 'Ralph', 'parents', 'are', 'invited', 'dinner', 'meet', 'Hurley', 'who', 'have', 'explained', 'Jack', 'day', 'only', 'immediate', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'wedding', 'Jack', 'outraged', 'not', 'guest', 'list', 'Aggie', 'brother', 'have', 'numerous', 'other', 'siblings', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'Jack', 'was', 'invited', 'not', 'them.The', 'Hallorans', 'arrive', 'meet', 'family', 'Jack', 'out', 'lady', 'friend', 'room', 'bedroom', 'been', 'hastily', 'converted', 'dining', 'room/sitting', 'room', 'entertaining', 'guests', 'Hallorans', 'appear', 'comfortably', 'Mr', 'Halloran', 'only', 'too', 'ready', 'brag', 'business', 'prowess', 'big', 'send', 'offs', 'daughters', 'wedding', 'days', 'paid', 'prepared', 'help', 'son', 'daughter', 'inlaw-to-be', 'financially', 'Hurleys', 'soon', 'Aggie', 'committing', 'family', 'finances', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'just', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'doing', 'right', 'daughter.Tom', 'Hurley', 'been', 'saving', '12', 'years', 'scrape', 'together', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'cab', 'friend', 'men', 'need', '4,000', 'buy', 'new', 'cab', 'licence', 'driver', 'retire', 'money', 'Aggie', 'pledging', 'spend', 'big', 'wedding', 'one', 'stage', 'orders', '10', 'limosines', 'take', 'complete', 'family', 'reception', 'grand', 'style', 'midst', 'anxiety', 'shame', 'Jack', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'own', 'arrangements', 'lady', 'friend', 'Mrs', 'Rafferty', 'wee', 'bit', 'weather', 'informing', 'Mrs', 'Halloran', 'sofa', 'sitting', 'bed', 'barely', 'concealed', 'anger', 'earlier', 'argument', 'sister', 'Aggie', 'mixed', 'naturally', 'mischievousness', 'Hallorans', 'bid', 'hasty', 'good', 'night.The', 'relationship', 'Aggie', 'Tom', 'strained', 'silent', 'glowering', 'moody', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'good', 'provider', 'resenting', 'lack', 'attention', 'wife', 'When', 'Jack', 'marrying', 'moving', 'Mrs', 'Rafferty', 'Tom', 'suggestion', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'take', 'Jack', 'room.For', 'first', 'time', 'married', 'life', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Hurley', 'will', 'be', 'own', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'son', 'joining', 'army', 'elder', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'Korea', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'moved', 'out', 'morning', 'wedding', 'Aggie', 'husband', 'sleep', 'night', 'shift', 'last', 'minute', 'irons', 'shirt', 'suit', 'then', 'sits', 'waits', 'patiently', 'wake', 'up', 'new', 'day', 'new', 'start', 'rediscovered', 'respect', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'enjoy', 'new', 'lives.Bette', 'Davis', 'probably', 'biggest', 'female', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Years', 'was', 'great', 'actress', 'given', 'playing', 'roles', 'did', 'Crawford', 'Shearer', 'etc', 'were', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'thus', 'difficult', 'later', 'generations', 'get', 'teeth', 'wanted', 'work', 'was', 'so', 'desperate', 'roles', 'advertised', 'Variety', 'other', 'papers', 'struck', 'gold', 'Eve', 'then', 'again', 'Catered', 'Affair', 'star', 'had', 'turned', 'first', 'rate', 'character', 'actress', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'poverty', 'hardship', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'doing', 'one', 'best', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'was', 'perfect', 'gentle', 'battler', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'really', 'surprised', 'depth', 'performance', 'fine', 'effort']",N/A
