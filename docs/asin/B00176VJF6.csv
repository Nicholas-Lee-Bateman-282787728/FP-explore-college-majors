Their experience is a shared one, which lends credibility even further. They may be claiming extraterrestrial origins (and after watching this, that is entirely believable) but what I really felt was the humanity of their situation. How difficult it all must be! They are two brave people & I'm glad their story is being told.",5,k7,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,533,"['What', 'Ann', 'Jason', 'have', 'been', 'continue', 'face', 'difficult', 'believe', 'paper', 'once', 'see', 'people', 'first', 'hand', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'truth', 'PROFOUND', 'experience', 'shared', 'one', 'credibility', 'even', 'further', 'may', 'be', 'claiming', 'extraterrestrial', 'origins', 'watching', 'entirely', 'believable', 'what', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'humanity', 'situation', 'How', 'difficult', 'must', 'be', 'are', 'two', 'people', ""'m"", 'glad', 'story', 'being', 'told']","Walking Between Worlds, Belonging to None - The Ann Andrews Story"
1155920,A1M059EQ1KNRYR,B00176VJF6,"M. Starkey ""AustyKai""","[2, 2]","The events chronicled in the entertaining and intriguing true story are difficult to dispute.  The almost alien possession that occurs at the Hawknest Farm is so scary and compelling, especially in the birthday scene.  The personal interviews with Anne really explain the detail and fear involving the abductions of Anne and Jason.  You really feel for Anne as she describes how it feels to have people/police refuse to believe what was happening.  This DVD serves almost as vindication for Anne.  This is very well done and well worth your time.  Highly recommended.",5,Seemingly real,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,567,"['events', 'chronicled', 'entertaining', 'intriguing', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'difficult', 'dispute', 'almost', 'alien', 'possession', 'Hawknest', 'Farm', 'so', 'scary', 'compelling', 'especially', 'birthday', 'scene', 'personal', 'interviews', 'Anne', 'really', 'explain', 'detail', 'fear', 'involving', 'abductions', 'Anne', 'Jason', 'really', 'feel', 'Anne', 'how', 'have', 'people/police', 'refuse', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'DVD', 'almost', 'vindication', 'Anne', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'time', 'Highly', 'recommended']","Walking Between Worlds, Belonging to None - The Ann Andrews Story"

I'd hate to ruin the dvd for you but I will say that it is definitely worth the time and money.
