But then, I'm saddened that films like this rarely make it into the hands of people like me. Beyond socio-economic demographics, our young people today are force fed some quite non-quality materials, and it's passed off as the trend of a generation. Well, it'll be a generation lost.Okay, off my soapbox. I loved the cinematography of this film. There was a subtle richness that often made you feel like you were really in a tropical locale. Acting doesn't get any better than when the high ranking officer has to get a surgical procedure and.....well, I don't want to spoil it but hi-jinx ensue! I've spent years (pre- and post- Google) trying to find the name of this film until I remember Jack Nicholson had a bit role in it.

236706,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6300270408,MadMacs,"[5, 5]","Interesting how the passage of decades can change one's perspective.When I first screened this I remember feeling sick. In my mind it was black and white with no compromise - there could be no replacement for Jack Lemmon & Co. And unless he was going to reprise his role - then no one could or should. Remember, he won an Academy Award for his performance as Ensign Pulver - it was that good. Anything and anyone that came after was never going to be enough.Saw this film again for the first time in more than a quarter century.I was wrong.Today, it's my belief that one should see this as a complete and standalone production with no connection to 'Mister Roberts' the film. It is in fact proximally closer to 'Mister Roberts' the stage play.What changed my mind were the truly outstanding performances of co-stars Robert Walker Jr. and Burl Ives.Walker's energetic and amusing take on said ensign was genuine; an approach that I felt was touching and very real. While Ives is a true chameleon! A powerhouse performance that can honestly be described as incredible. While not taking anything away from the amazing Jimmy Cagney, whose interpretation of the character was petty and conniving, but generally ""all there"" - Burl sent the character to the edge of sanity. A startling execution as the driven, maniacal and severely damaged Captain Morton which, in my mind, completely redefined the role. Hard to believe this is the the same person who was the saintly songster and cuddly Christmas character of my youth.The one character whom I thought had lost a step in the sequel was 'Doc'. Terribly missed was the immortal William Powell and his subtle interpretation as the wise elder; the insightful physician whose gentle prods and careful manipulations were a much better fit than Walther Matthau's scream-infused gesticulated interpretation of the same man.We pick up the story several months since the tragic news that Mr. Roberts was killed after finally escaping 'The Bucket'. That terrible shock being the impetus for mousey Pulver to step up and become the man his friend always hoped was in there. But like all such life altering moments - if it wasn't there before, it won't be there later. Meaning that change, real change, is more than just an involuntary reflex to a bad situation. It takes a profound effort to become a different person.Too many people today, young and old, pay lip service to such; preferring platitudes and self-righteous aggrandizement instead of an honest look in the mirror. And just like those self-deceiving gasbags of today - Ensign Frank Pulver has regressed backwards.Suddenly, an unexpected sea storm and the understandable ravings of a sailor on the brink of madness coalesce into another moment for Frank to rediscover his manhood for good.But will he recognize it? And will he take a hold and seize the opportunity, not just for himself, but for every beaten and demoralized sailor on The Bucket?Walker's performance was enjoyable, dotted with startling light touches of character brilliance shining through. My unfortunate initial reaction all those years ago was so knee-jerk. And, sadly, shared by critics and audiences alike in 1964.The movie tanked and Robert was excoriated. His movie career never recovered.A terrible injustice. And it's one that his stepfather, legendary producer David O. Selznick, should have foreseen.Very unfortunate. Very unfair.It's my hope that this review will provide another cinephile a different perspective - and perhaps they will give this film another chance.",4,A Chance To Mend An Injustice,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,3544,"['Interesting', 'how', 'passage', 'decades', 'can', 'change', 'one', 'perspective.When', 'first', 'screened', 'remember', 'feeling', 'sick', 'mind', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'compromise', 'could', 'be', 'replacement', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Co.', 'was', 'going', 'reprise', 'role', 'then', 'one', 'could', 'should', 'Remember', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Ensign', 'Pulver', 'was', 'good', 'Anything', 'anyone', 'came', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'enough.Saw', 'film', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'quarter', 'century.I', 'was', 'wrong.Today', 'belief', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'complete', 'standalone', 'production', 'connection', ""'Mister"", 'Roberts', 'film', 'fact', 'proximally', 'closer', ""'Mister"", 'Roberts', 'stage', 'play.What', 'changed', 'mind', 'were', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'co-stars', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'Jr.', 'Burl', 'Ives.Walker', 'energetic', 'amusing', 'take', 'said', 'ensign', 'was', 'genuine', 'approach', 'felt', 'was', 'touching', 'very', 'real', 'Ives', 'true', 'chameleon', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'can', 'honestly', 'be', 'described', 'incredible', 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'amazing', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'interpretation', 'character', 'was', 'petty', 'conniving', 'generally', 'Burl', 'sent', 'character', 'edge', 'sanity', 'startling', 'execution', 'driven', 'maniacal', 'severely', 'damaged', 'Captain', 'Morton', 'mind', 'completely', 'redefined', 'role', 'Hard', 'believe', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'saintly', 'songster', 'cuddly', 'Christmas', 'character', 'youth.The', 'one', 'character', 'whom', 'thought', 'had', 'lost', 'step', 'sequel', 'was', ""'Doc"", 'Terribly', 'missed', 'was', 'immortal', 'William', 'Powell', 'subtle', 'interpretation', 'wise', 'elder', 'insightful', 'physician', 'gentle', 'prods', 'careful', 'manipulations', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'fit', 'Walther', 'Matthau', 'scream-infused', 'gesticulated', 'interpretation', 'same', 'man.We', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'several', 'months', 'tragic', 'news', 'Mr.', 'Roberts', 'was', 'killed', 'finally', 'escaping', 'Bucket', 'terrible', 'shock', 'being', 'impetus', 'mousey', 'Pulver', 'step', 'up', 'become', 'man', 'friend', 'always', 'hoped', 'was', 'there', 'such', 'life', 'altering', 'moments', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'before', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'later', 'Meaning', 'change', 'real', 'change', 'more', 'just', 'involuntary', 'reflex', 'bad', 'situation', 'profound', 'effort', 'become', 'different', 'person.Too', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'young', 'old', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'such', 'preferring', 'platitudes', 'self-righteous', 'aggrandizement', 'instead', 'honest', 'look', 'mirror', 'just', 'self-deceiving', 'gasbags', 'today', 'Ensign', 'Frank', 'Pulver', 'regressed', 'backwards.Suddenly', 'unexpected', 'sea', 'storm', 'understandable', 'ravings', 'sailor', 'brink', 'madness', 'coalesce', 'moment', 'Frank', 'rediscover', 'manhood', 'good.But', 'will', 'recognize', 'will', 'take', 'hold', 'seize', 'opportunity', 'not', 'just', 'beaten', 'demoralized', 'sailor', 'Bucket', 'Walker', 'performance', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'dotted', 'startling', 'light', 'touches', 'character', 'brilliance', 'shining', 'unfortunate', 'initial', 'reaction', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'so', 'knee-jerk', 'sadly', 'shared', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', '1964.The', 'movie', 'tanked', 'Robert', 'was', 'excoriated', 'movie', 'career', 'never', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'one', 'stepfather', 'legendary', 'producer', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'should', 'have', 'foreseen.Very', 'unfortunate', 'Very', 'unfair.It', 'hope', 'review', 'will', 'provide', 'cinephile', 'different', 'perspective', 'perhaps', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'chance']",N/A

It's the sequel to Mr Roberts and I can remember watching it with my grandmother when she was babysitting us at least 45 years ago. Don't ask me why that memory is so strong but I can remember her getting so tickled when Pulver talks about shooting the captain in the ""beautocks"" instead of buttocks. Grandma is long gone but I will always have her in my heart and this movie just brings that memory closer.That being said, most sequels are really terrible, but this one works to the tune of three stars (the fourth is for the previous memory). Even if it didn't the fact that Millie Perkins is in it would make it worth watching. Burl Ives and Walter Matthau chew the scenery and it's really fun to see some people that went on to be quite famous later in life performing in early bit parts including Peter Marshall, Larry Hagman and Jack Nicholson.",4,It's been years,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,884,"['love', 'movie', 'always', 'have', 'sequel', 'Mr', 'Roberts', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'grandmother', 'when', 'was', 'babysitting', 'least', '45', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'memory', 'so', 'strong', 'can', 'remember', 'getting', 'so', 'tickled', 'when', 'Pulver', 'shooting', 'captain', 'beautocks', 'instead', 'buttocks', 'Grandma', 'long', 'gone', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'heart', 'movie', 'just', 'memory', 'closer.That', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'sequels', 'are', 'really', 'terrible', 'one', 'tune', 'three', 'stars', 'fourth', 'previous', 'memory', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Millie', 'Perkins', 'would', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'chew', 'scenery', 'really', 'fun', 'see', 'people', 'went', 'be', 'quite', 'famous', 'later', 'life', 'performing', 'early', 'bit', 'parts', 'including', 'Peter', 'Marshall', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Jack', 'Nicholson']",N/A
