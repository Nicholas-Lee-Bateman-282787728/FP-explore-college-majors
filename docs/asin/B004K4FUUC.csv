The only excitement in his life was when he fell off a ladder or lost his job, although he had values and ideals which he fought for, he did it in a boring way.

1411883,A2DDHI1MY91NQU,B004K4FUUC,CharlestonCasual,"[0, 0]","Season 4 is a very short (6 Episodes), as I must conclude that the departure of actor Brendan Coyle, who played Robert Timmins...who went to the now acclaimed series Downton Abbey (Mr. Bates), caused the writers of Lark Rise to Candleford to draw the season and the series to a conclusion. This is abundantly obvious as episodes 1-5 are very good episodes (as usual), but give no indication to the viewer that a conclusion is in the works. Episode 6, from the very beginning gives you the immediate impression of a writer bringing characters & relationships to a point where the viewer will be somewhat satisfied with the outcome, and for the most part...not want or need more to know what happens to who. EXCEPT FOR LAURA!!!!! HELLO??? Although there are numerous strong characters in this series, I have always considered Laura Timmins (daughter of Robert Timmins) the focal point of the series, and the one who documents the lives of those in her community. I'm fairly certain that she and Daniel end up getting married, but you never know with Laura. She is so very strong, and her opinions come with conviction...that it will take a unique individual for Laura to see as her mate.All of this said....this was such a wonderful series, with superb writing and a strong cast. I put off watching Season 4 as I realized that it was the final season with only 6 episodes to emerse myself into. If I could rate the series higher than 5 stars...I certainly would. And if the writers ever decide to revisit Lark Rise to Candleford, I am quite certain that they would have an audience so ready to see where & what their favorite actor(s) are up to.

Hmph...  That is my only beef.  It is really a lot cheaper to just buy them and download them instead.But as far as the show itself is concerned, this might be the best season of them all.  Whereas most shows end with struggling ratings or actors just phoning it in, the cast and writing remain terrific throughout this season.  We don't get to see Robert Timmons again (no spoiler there), as the actor was either filming Downton Abbey or had some other contractual issue.  But the rest of the core cast is dazzling.  There are even a couple of surprise return characters.The series is a drama, but is never really melodrama.  The plots are subtle and mostly involve the characters learning from mistakes or learning life skills from others in the towns.  In one episode we see the shock at a female attempting to play an off season, 'friendly' cricket match.  Situations typically involve work (or lack thereof), morals, neighborly differences, or even the effect a new lodger has on a house.There is a reason the British went up in arms about this series being cancelled and there being only 6 episodes, but I think that ending the show while it is strong is a good thing.  The ending is quite good and leaves the viewer with a sense that things will go on and the towns of Lark Rise and Candleford will have to accept the coming changes - good or bad.What a wonderful series this has been.

Gross ""Country Parson""","[0, 0]","&#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; is a well-written drama series punctuated with lots of humor and occasionally some pathos. Much of the acting is first-rate and the production values (especially design) are superb.What stops me from giving the series five stars is the inability of the writers to refrain from looking at the late 19th century through an early 21st century lens. I realize the series is based on memoirs written by a woman who did live from the late 19th through the mid-20th century. In all honesty, I haven't read these memoirs (although I would like to). However, I'm fairly certain the author did not offer all of the opinions and observations spoken by the characters in this series. And many of those opinions and observations (especially concerning feminism, religion, and the impact of technological innovation on rural society) simply don't sound plausible coming from the mouths of people who are supposed to be living in the period from 1895-1898.Having said all that, I enjoyed the series tremendously. I found it a wonderful escape from daily life and an all-round satisfying source of entertainment. I adore Julia Sawalha's Dorcas Lane, admire Mark Heap's Thomas Brown, and feel great affection for Sandy McDade's Margaret Ellison Brown. Oh, and the little boy who plays Sydney is more or less irresistible.Though I find the the series flawed as an introduction to British social history, I highly recommend it as an entertainment--which is obviously what it was intended to be!",4,"A Charming Entertainment, Though A Bit of Fairytale",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1509,"['34', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', '34', 'well-written', 'drama', 'series', 'punctuated', 'lots', 'humor', 'occasionally', 'pathos', 'Much', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'production', 'values', 'especially', 'design', 'are', 'superb.What', 'stops', 'giving', 'series', 'five', 'stars', 'inability', 'writers', 'refrain', 'looking', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'lens', 'realize', 'series', 'based', 'memoirs', 'written', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'live', 'late', '19th', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'honesty', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'memoirs', 'would', 'like', 'However', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'author', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'opinions', 'observations', 'spoken', 'characters', 'series', 'many', 'opinions', 'observations', 'especially', 'concerning', 'feminism', 'religion', 'impact', 'technological', 'innovation', 'rural', 'society', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'plausible', 'coming', 'mouths', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'living', 'period', '1895-1898.Having', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'tremendously', 'found', 'wonderful', 'escape', 'daily', 'life', 'all-round', 'satisfying', 'source', 'entertainment', 'adore', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'Dorcas', 'Lane', 'admire', 'Mark', 'Heap', 'Thomas', 'Brown', 'feel', 'great', 'affection', 'Sandy', 'McDade', 'Margaret', 'Ellison', 'Brown', 'Oh', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'Sydney', 'more', 'less', 'irresistible.Though', 'find', 'series', 'flawed', 'introduction', 'British', 'social', 'history', 'highly', 'recommend', 'entertainment', 'obviously', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'be']",Lark Rise to Candleford: Season 4

While the general story lines and characters were interesting and engaging, many times characters would just drop off of the series, never to be seen, or heard of, or spoken of again. There were so many loose ends leftover by the end of the series that I had to wonder if the producers had any clue at all about what their jobs were. It seemed to me--especially in the later seasons--that the writers and producers just gave up, or just didn't care about the series anymore.The final six episodes were very rushed--especially the last episode--and I cannot believe that so many characters--including the main character, Laura--didn't appear for even a moment in the last episode. Heck, there were main characters that didn't appear at all in the final season. I've noticed this trend with BBC programs, where actors and actresses seem to jump from job to job without satisfactorily completing their roll first, and no one seems to mind the mess it makes of the series' plot and story lines (Downton Abbey is a great example).In conclusion, it was a fun way to waste some time on my days off, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.

Having watched Seasons 1-3, I, of course, desired to see how it all ends.  Once again, in viewing Season four (4) of ""Lark Rise to Candleford "", I derived a break from my usual viewing habits of watching Murder Mystery/detective shows and intense dramas by watching this beautifully filmed program about the lives of some extremely nice folks living in early ""Victorian times"" in the very poor village of Lark Rise and the ""better off"" village of Candleford in England.  Once again, the times that are portrayed are so innocent and the problems that arise to be solved are, to me, so inconsequential.  However, they are indeed solved without any violence or cursing by some of the nicest, most wonderful people that I have ever seen on the big or small screen.  All of the ""happenings"" are seen through the eyes of Laura Timmins and mainly happen in the post office in Candleford where Laura is learning to be Post Office Mistress from Dorcas the super-good and kindly headmistress--Dorcas is acted by Julia Sawalha of ""AB FAB"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"".( By the way, the character of Laura's super good almost self-righteous father is gone in Season four working in London; however, her mother takes his place in the ""goodness department""  weeping,  worrying and ""gnashing her teeth""  a lot more in this season thus her father is not missed too much.)In Season four (4), I had a great deal of trouble putting my cynicism aside because I found all of the characters to be just too intently good and the situations to be just too farfetched (i.e., the episode about a snake was very unbelievable to me and a little too ""preachy"" for me to deal with).

1411928,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004K4FUUC,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[85, 89]","English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Perhaps, consider it a British mutation of ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""The Waltons."" A more earthy twist to ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" another Brit historical period series not to be missed.This set has 6 episodes of the commoner Lark Rise village and the more sophisticated Candleford. The short 8-mile separation allows for much intermingling, bigotry, conflict, forbidden love, political and economic interaction. It is not a family saga, not a nobility bloodline dramatization, but a saga of struggles and lifestyles of different kinds of personalities, each caught in their own born-into world, and interacting with another different, and not always understood, class of folk.Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), Lark Rise born, was sent to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. She is the spark caught between the two towns (sometimes world's different.) Her mentor is Dorcas (Julia Sawalha.) Plenty of past characters returning to make it a continuation in cast and story from the previous season.The cast is an assortment of either the die-hard, disheveled, working class or the Candleford higher class, shy of nobility range. Cast individuals make this memorable.One episode travels into the next with carryover from earlier material. If you have the time, watch all 6 back to back. TV viewers must have waited impatiently for the next installment. Episodes has multiple plots so it is hard to break down the 6 episodes into short summaries. And with carryover from one episode to another, it's more like moving to Lark Rise or Candleford and living with the good people (and the bad). A delightful scenic experience even Disney has never matched.Ah, Queenie (Linda Bassett), an old bee keeper, a favorite of mine, will make you laugh and cry, perhaps in the same scene. She can only be upstaged by her hubby, Twister (Karl Johnson.) Love that pair. Ruby (Victoria Hamilton) is back without her man, oops. Thomas (Mark Heap) is a postal delivery man who yet helps keep Christianity alive and aloud. Laura's ma, Emma (Claudie Blakley) is here, but pa, Robert is off working elsewhere. Well, the list could go on.Locations and sets to dream of as a vacation spot. Costumes to dazzle, delight, and disgust, depending upon the event. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga. The adapted books by Flora Thompson have never been read by this reviewer, but I can't imagine them being as fine as this TV series (and I'm a book lover). A superb British cast has perfected this story.Subtitles? Yes!Downside? Only 6 episodes, you'll want more.Recommendation? BUY NOW! It's that good.If you have not seen Series 1, 2, & 3, get those first. Watch them in order.

1411966,AHOBBFAUQU9IA,B004K4FUUC,Kt,"[5, 5]","I enjoyed watching this series.  I like period pieces and this one hit the spot.The characters were wonderful, with good casting and acting.  Every character had their own unique personality.  You got a taste of the more proper upper class and the laid back lower class.I did find that the characters acted a bit immature at times, especially when it came to dealings with one another about love and attraction.  It was also a little unrealistic with how the classes mingled.  The other unrealistic thing was how there were hints of Atheism when it came to Dorcas's views.  I felt that in this time period, speaking of Darwin and such would not be taken well in this time.--------Spoilers---------I'm going to discuss some of the characters here now, because I feel it's interesting to read what other people thought of them.I loved Minnie's character.  She was full of life and you could tell she felt emotions to the extreme.  She was also pretty amusing.  I have known someone similar to this in person so these people do exist.  I really was impressed in the scene where she told off Mrs. Arless.  She really was a dynamic actress and her spirit was admirable.  Usually characters who are proclaimed as ""unattractive"" get sulky and depressed but Minnie stayed positive and knew her good traits so this was nice to see in a tv show.  I also noticed how since Alf's mother was so full of life, it made sense that he chose a girl who also was very spunky.I liked Dorcas Lane also.  I thought she was extremely pretty and even though she was a bit older of age, she had a beauty which shined.  She was a model of grace always showed a proper face to the public, serving them delicious foods.  I noticed she seemed very good at showing when she was sad underneath but was mustering up a smile to greet people with.  This sort of sad look though did seem to get a bit repetitive as she often wore it.  Probably my favorite scene with her was on the prankster night.  It was nice to see her having some fun.  I wasn't really happy with who she ended up with though.  I didn't really see what spark was between her and her choice, and the guy honestly seemed a little shabby in dress and I hated his stringy bangs.  She was more suited imo to someone more prince-ly or king-ly.  I couldn't help but feeling she just clung on to this guy because he was a man and around.  I felt that her original love interest was more suited for her, and I found it sad that he ended up sticking it out in a less-than-ideal marriage.My other two favorites were Twister and Queenie.  Twister was pretty hilarious with his quips and strange gallivanting personality.  I liked his dynamic with Queenie: the wise strong beekeeper of the town.  I admired Queenie's character.  She seemed to hold the town together in a way.  Though I wondered sometimes where they got their income from to stay in their cottage.  My favorite scene with them was definitely the dragon fight.  It was pretty amusing- you got to see their dynamic come out here, and their reconciliation after the fight was sweet.I thought it was a little odd that even though Laura Timmins was the narrator, she was not one of the strongest characters and did not often become the center of the show.  I didn't think this was a bad thing as her character wasn't that great, although it did seem odd that her narrative at the beginning and end seemed to have quite a bit more wisdom than her character did.  I suppose it could be her narrating as an adult with a more grown-up mind which could explain it.The Pratt sisters were quite interesting too.  They came off as sort of the more sinister meddling characters at first, but then showed their softer sides.  I saw some symbolism there where they were always dressed in black at first, yet once their characters got softer they changed to brighter clothes.  I admired the elder sister for her strength, and the younger one for her heart (Though Ruby's constant teary-eyedness got a tad annoying).  Regardless, they made a good team.  I was disappointed we never got to see Ruby's love interest though.Anyway, I could go on as there were more interesting and likable characters, but I will stop there.  What I really loved about this series was that not one character was all good or all evil.  They all had their faults and showed both their good and bad sides.One point of disappointment in the show for me was when they showed the ""ghost.""  This show seemed to be set in a realistic world, and I felt that the ghost spirit contradicted the setting in this series.  I felt it would have been better if they had left us guessing who the girl really was, leaving it open to be a real person who was caught up in the story of the past.  Yet when they showed her basically disappearing in thin air, I found this to be out of place and a little silly.Overall, I really enjoyed this series.  It was a fun ride and I was sad to see it end.  I will miss this world of Lark Rise and Candleford and wish they would make more seasons.",4,Good Show - Spoilers,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,5015,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'series', 'like',

I was puzzled by Season 4 being shorter than its predecessors until I read another viewer's comment that the show was going to finally be cancelled.  Therefore, the writers of the series had only a limited time to conclude Lark Rise to Candleford. I think they did their best to bring closure to the characters' lives, but I do feel that these last episodes were &#34;sped up&#34; in pace to try to create a conclusion. I was left wanting more, which shows how involved I was in all this whole series!

1412058,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B004K4FUUC,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","Lark Rise to Candleford is a charming BBC period drama that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane ( a brilliant Julia Sawalha who first impressed me as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. A young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time, such as postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade); Minnie the maid (clumsy and awkward yet so innocent and plain speaking); the wise and at times clairvoyant Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) and her simpleton husband Twister; young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh), the Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler), and others.In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey). The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - Dorcas' torment regarding her relationship with Sir Timothy Midwinter and the impact on Sir Timothy's wife (one of my favorite episodes was the one where Sir Tim's wife finds the abandoned girl and insists on raising her as their own given their childlessness, and then goes berserk when she finds Dorcas and Timothy have been sort of 'plotting' behind her back); the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC.",5,The final
