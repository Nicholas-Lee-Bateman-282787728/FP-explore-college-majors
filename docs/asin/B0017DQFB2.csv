First time I watched it I didn't like the film, it was very confusing and too much woods. When you watch the movie you will know what I mean. If you do not like puzzling suspense movies don't bother with this one. It will keep you guessing to the end. I do like a movie that I can't figure out right away but this one bored me in spots because the drew it out too long.

1156863,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0017DQFB2,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","The box claims the name of the main character is Steven. In the movie his name is Fred Hill.(Canadian film give-away.) The movie starts off with Fred or Steven (LDP) coming to, after being hung upside down by his foot in a tree. He has blood on his head and a knife falls from his belt. The rope breaks and LDP is on the ground with a bum knee and no memory on how he got where he was, who did this to him, or if they are still around. So what does he do? He shouts for help. Then when he hears someone coming in his direction (apparently the reason why he was shouting) he takes off running in the opposite direction. The man, Andy, who catches up with him has a gun, and LDP has no memory.  They walk through the woods, with LDP being bullied at gun point, looking for the two story ""cabin"" with LDP getting bits and pieces of his memory back as they stroll along. His memory is confusing as sometimes he sees himself, then sometimes he sees Andy doing the exact same thing. Most of the film is taken up by the stroll in the woods with flashbacks. When they finally get to the cabin, you can't wait for the movie to end. By that point I really couldn't care who did what. No nudity. No sex. Not much plot. Bad language. Unless you are related to LDP, there is no reason to watch this film.",1,THEY SCREWED UP THE BOX TOO!,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,1291,"['box', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'Steven', 'movie', 'name', 'Fred', 'Hill', 'Canadian', 'film', 'give-away', 'movie', 'Fred', 'Steven', 'LDP', 'coming', 'being', 'hung', 'upside', 'down', 'foot', 'tree', 'blood', 'head', 'knife', 'belt', 'rope', 'breaks', 'LDP', 'ground', 'bum', 'knee', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'was', 'who', 'did', 'are', 'still', 'around', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'help', 'Then', 'when', 'someone', 'coming', 'direction', 'apparently', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'shouting', 'off', 'running', 'opposite', 'direction', 'man', 'Andy', 'who', 'up', 'gun', 'LDP', 'memory', 'walk', 'woods', 'LDP', 'being', 'bullied', 'gun', 'point', 'looking', 'two', 'story', 'cabin', 'LDP', 'getting', 'bits', 'pieces', 'memory', 'back', 'stroll', 'along', 'memory', 'confusing', 'sometimes', 'then', 'sometimes', 'Andy', 'doing', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'Most', 'film', 'taken', 'up', 'stroll', 'woods', 'flashbacks', 'When', 'finally', 'get', 'cabin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'end', 'point', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'nudity', 'sex', 'Not', 'much', 'plot', 'Bad', 'language', 'are', 'related', 'LDP', 'reason', 'watch', 'film']",Never Forget
