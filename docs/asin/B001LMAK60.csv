1215072,AFVROUVTT63XM,B001LMAK60,"Dr. H. A. Jones ""Howard Jones""","[1, 1]","This is a film of a book by Jodi Picoult about the effects an alleged date rape incident has on both families involved. Freshman Trixie Stone (Britt Robertson) accuses her ex-boyfriend Jason Underhill (Jamie Johnston) of rape; but the issue is confused by the fact that Trixie was apparently drugged and cannot remember events clearly, and she was acting provocatively at a party organized by her best friend Zepher Santorelli (Hayley Beauchamp) in order to try to win her boyfriend back from his current girlfriend. Trixie is looked after in the daytime by her father, Daniel (Ron Eldard) who works from home as an artist. Trixie's mother Laura (Kelly Preston) is a college professor whose extra-curricular activities include having an affair with one of her students. When Underhill falls from a bridge into the river and drowns, the question is whether he jumped or whether he was pushed. Father, mother and daughter all appear to have motive and opportunity. There are obvious allusions to the circles of hell in Dante's Inferno.

Maybe it doesn't really matter because the movie isn't about rape but about the suffering that all victims go through.Robertson suffers mightily, beginning at the hospital when she reports having been raped.  The medical staff are distant and mechanical.  The OB-GYN doctor is unfeeling and a little snotty.  She seems to flourish the cold stainless steel of the instrument she's about to insert into poor Robertson in the stirrups.  After that, the police interrogate her intensively and further humiliate her.  One of them (a woman) refers to ""the quote-unquote rape.""  And after THAT, at school, she becomes ""the school's designated germ.""  If there's anything that makes these movies about cruel teens bearable it's the occasional gem-like slang terms they come up with.Then there's Jason's suffering.  It appears that he did in fact violate her after feeding her a date-rape drug, the kind found only in movies, that has caused the gaps in her memory that roused the suspicions of the police.  (I hope you're following all this.)  He's supernally good looking and a weight lifter and, though the girls at school say, ""I wish Jason would rape ME"", when they mock Robertson, Jason's life is ruined.  I guess he doesn't like to be thought of as having to rape anyone, though the police don't charge him, because he gets drunk one night and disappears into the icy waters of the Prospect River.But his victimhood is weightless compared to that of Robertson's dad, Ron Eldard, the guy who was the helicopter pilot with the easy blue eyes who was shot down in ""Blackhawk Down.""  There is some evidence that Eldard had a hand in convincing Jason that it was a fine idea to jump off the bridge into the Prospect River.  So the police begin an investigation of his movements that night.The police are about to get serious about Eldard when his wife (Preston) finally confesses that she was there when Jason, drunk, fell from the bridge.  Yes -- YES -- it was HER blood on the railing, where she scraped her wrist trying to save him!That's four victims for the price of one.  Order right now and we'll add a fifth suffering victim!Actually, it's not that bad.  It's stuffed with misery and guilt but it's more of a mystery than the usual tear jerker.  And it has its moments, at least in the dialog if not in the performances or the direction.  The mother and her husband are fans of Dante Alighieri for some reason, perhaps to provide the title.  When Preston tells her story of trying to save Jason, she quotes from ""The Divine Comedy"":  ""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate"", or ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"".  She adds a tenth circle of hell to Dante's nine, reserved ""for those who lie to themselves by pretending they're not hurting the ones they love.""  It was a little too deep for me and slipped past my apperceptive apparatus.I don't mind movies shot in Canada, like this one, though there are some who believe it may be part of a Canadian scheme to milk money from Americans.  This one was shot in Nova Scotia.  It's just that, if they're going to shoot it in Toronto or Windsor or Vancouver, at least give it a sense of place, some local color.  IDENTIFY the city.  Be proud of it!  Use the names of real streets and neighborhoods.  Don't try to disguise the Canadian accents -- let a hundred ""hooses"" flourish!",2,Monumental Suffering.,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,3687,"['Here', 'conversational', 'exchange', 'know', 'what', 'expect.Wife', 'rushes', 'up', 'husband', 'Where', 'Jason', 'Husband', 'have', 'idea', 'Wife', 'claps', 'hands', 'cheeks', 'OMG', 'missed', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'fifteen-year-old', 'virgin', 'Robertson', 'was', 'actually', 'raped', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'Jason', 'Johnston', 'noisy', 'party', 'not', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rape', 'suffering', 'victims', 'go', 'through.Robertson', 'suffers', 'mightily', 'beginning', 'hospital', 'when', 'having', 'been', 'raped', 'medical', 'staff', 'are', 'distant', 'mechanical', 'OB-GYN', 'doctor', 'unfeeling', 'little', 'snotty', 'flourish', 'cold', 'stainless', 'steel', 'instrument', 'insert', 'poor', 'Robertson', 'stirrups', 'police', 'interrogate', 'intensively', 'further', 'humiliate', 'One', 'woman', 'quote-unquote', 'rape', 'school', 'school', 'designated', 'germ', 'anything', 'movies', 'cruel', 'teens', 'bearable', 'occasional', 'gem-like', 'slang', 'terms', 'come', 'up', 'Jason', 'suffering', 'did', 'fact', 'feeding', 'date-rape', 'drug', 'kind', 'found', 'only', 'movies', 'caused', 'gaps', 'memory', 'roused', 'suspicions', 'police', 'hope', ""'re"", 'following', 'supernally', 'good', 'looking', 'weight', 'lifter', 'girls', 'school', 'say', 'wish', 'Jason', 'would', 'rape', 'ME', 'when', 'mock', 'Robertson', 'Jason', 'life', 'ruined', 'guess', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'thought', 'having', 'rape', 'anyone', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'charge', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'icy', 'waters', 'Prospect', 'River.But', 'victimhood', 'weightless', 'compared', 'Robertson', 'dad', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'easy', 'blue', 'eyes', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'evidence', 'Eldard', 'had', 'hand', 'convincing', 'Jason', 'was', 'fine', 'idea', 'jump', 'off', 'bridge', 'Prospect', 'River', 'police', 'begin', 'investigation', 'movements', 'night.The', 'police', 'are', 'get', 'serious', 'Eldard', 'when', 'wife', 'Preston', 'finally', 'was', 'there', 'when', 'Jason', 'drunk', 'fell', 'bridge', 'Yes', 'YES', 'was', 'HER', 'blood', 'railing', 'where', 'scraped', 'wrist', 'trying', 'save', 'four', 'victims', 'price', 'one', 'Order', 'right', 'now', ""'ll"", 'add', 'fifth', 'suffering', 'victim', 'Actually', 'not', 'bad', 'stuffed', 'misery', 'guilt', 'more', 'mystery', 'usual', 'tear', 'jerker', 'moments', 'least', 'dialog', 'not', 'performances', 'direction', 'mother', 'husband', 'are', 'fans', 'Dante', 'Alighieri', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'provide', 'title', 'When', 'Preston', 'story', 'trying', 'save', 'Jason', 'Divine', 'Comedy', 'Lasciate', 'ogne', 'speranza', 'voi', ""ch'entrate"", 'Abandon', 'hope', 'ye', 'who', 'enter', 'here', 'tenth', 'circle', 'hell', 'Dante', 'nine', 'reserved', 'who', 'lie', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'not', 'hurting', 'ones', 'love', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'deep', 'slipped', 'past', 'apperceptive', 'apparatus.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movies', 'shot', 'Canada', 'one', 'are', 'who', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'Canadian', 'scheme', 'milk', 'money', 'Americans', 'one', 'was', 'shot', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'just', 'that', ""'re"", 'going', 'shoot', 'Toronto', 'Windsor', 'Vancouver', 'least', 'give', 'sense', 'place', 'local', 'color', 'city', 'Be', 'proud', 'Use', 'names', 'real', 'streets', 'neighborhoods', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'disguise', 'Canadian', 'accents', 'let', 'hundred', 'hooses', 'flourish']",The Tenth Circle
1215075,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001LMAK60,Z Hayes,"[7, 7]","Based on best-selling novelist Jodi Picoult's ""The Tenth Circle"", this movie adaptation [first aired on Lifetime] provides a searing portrayal of a family in crisis. Freshman Trixie Stone [Britt Robertson] comes home from a party and breaks down in front of her dad Daniel [Ron Eldard], claiming an ex-boyfriend, Jason raped her. Thus begins the family's descent into 'hell', and when deeply hidden family secrets get exposed,the very fabric of the family is threatened.Mom and wife Laura [Kelly Preston] is a college professor who is having an affair with her student and is wracked by guilt when she is absent from home during Trixie's breakdown. Dad and husband Daniel also has a secret - he was once a suspect in a murder investigation. Things get worse when Jason, the alleged rapist, is found dead in the river sometime later. Though it's initially ruled a suicide, evidence points to something else, and Daniel finds himself embroiled in a murder investigation for the second time.Though it does play out like a made-for-TV movie, I found it quite watchable - Britt Robertson is excellent as the emotionally vulnerable Trixie and Ron Eldard is credible as the devastated father who is also struggling with his marriage. Kelly Preston's performance as Laura failed to impress and her scenes weren't that many.The DVD has no extras [except for some movie trailers]. All in all , this is worth checking out, especially for fans of Ms Picoult [I also liked the screen adaptation of Plain Truth with Mariska Hargitay].",4,A suspenseful and compelling family drama,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,1520,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'novelist', 'Jodi', 'Picoult', 'Tenth', 'Circle', 'movie', 'adaptation', '[', 'first', 'aired', 'Lifetime', ']', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'family', 'crisis', 'Freshman', 'Trixie', 'Stone', '[', 'Britt', 'Robertson', ']', 'home', 'party', 'breaks', 'down', 'front', 'dad', 'Daniel', '[', 'Ron', 'Eldard', ']', 'claiming', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jason', 'raped', 'Thus', 'family', 'descent', ""'hell"", 'when', 'deeply', 'hidden', 'family', 'secrets', 'get', 'exposed', 'very', 'fabric', 'family', 'threatened.Mom', 'wife', 'Laura', '[', 'Kelly', 'Preston', ']', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'student', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'when', 'absent', 'home', 'Trixie', 'breakdown', 'Dad', 'husband', 'Daniel', 'also', 'secret', 'was', 'once', 'suspect', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Jason', 'alleged', 'rapist', 'found', 'dead', 'river', 'sometime', 'later', 'initially', 'ruled', 'suicide', 'evidence', 'points', 'something', 'else', 'Daniel', 'embroiled', 'murder', 'investigation', 'second', 'play', 'out', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'found', 'quite', 'watchable', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'excellent', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'Trixie', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'credible', 'devastated', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'struggling', 'marriage', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'performance', 'Laura', 'failed', 'impress', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'many.The', 'DVD', 'extras', '[', 'movie', 'trailers', ']', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'especially', 'fans', 'Ms', 'Picoult', '[', 'also', 'liked', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Plain', 'Truth', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', ']']",The Tenth Circle
