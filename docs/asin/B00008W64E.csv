747789,A379SAP75SPDHD,B00008W64E,Alec Solomita,"[25, 31]","Master and Commander is one of the better nautical films to be released in a long time. That is partially due to the fact that there are not many films that take place at sea. It is refreshing to watch a film about naval fleets and the battles they fought on the high sea, without having to add romance or make your prototypical hero characters. Russell Crowe gives a good performance as the commander of the fleet and is very believeable in the role. His character is a man who only knows the sea and only knows victory, and it is a loss at sea that is the premise for the film as his character, Lucky Jack, pursues his enemy at all cost to win. Paul Bettany also fairs well as the doctor on the ship and explorer when Lucky Jack allows the crew to dock on land. The exploring side of this film is its most interesting aspect, as not many films have shown us characters and explorations like this. The two battle scenes are very well staged and executed, as is the rest of the cast, especially the children sailors, who have more responsibility at sea than many adults would ever have in their life. There are some boring spots in this long film, but it is worth the price to see a well done film. Peter Weir is one of the best directors around, and while the film falls short of being great, Weir's direction does not. Crowe and Bettany both put in performances worthy of Oscar talk, but not nominations. This film will have to settle for being a very good film, and that is nothing to apologize for.",4,Master & Commander is a smooth sail!,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1502,"['Master', 'Commander', 'one', 'better', 'nautical', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'long', 'time', 'partially', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'sea', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'film', 'naval', 'fleets', 'battles', 'fought', 'high', 'sea', 'having', 'add', 'romance', 'make', 'prototypical', 'hero', 'characters', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'good', 'performance', 'commander', 'fleet', 'very', 'believeable', 'role', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'sea', 'only', 'victory', 'loss', 'sea', 'premise', 'film', 'character', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'enemy', 'cost', 'win', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'also', 'fairs', 'well', 'doctor', 'ship', 'explorer', 'when', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'crew', 'dock', 'land', 'exploring', 'side', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'characters', 'explorations', 'two', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'staged', 'executed', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'children', 'sailors', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'responsibility', 'sea', 'many', 'adults', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'life', 'are', 'boring', 'spots', 'long', 'film', 'price', 'see', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'film', 'short', 'being', 'great', 'Weir', 'direction', 'not', 'Crowe', 'Bettany', 'put', 'performances', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'talk', 'not', 'nominations', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'settle', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'nothing', 'apologize']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747790,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00008W64E,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[3, 3]","""Master and Commander"" is a film I never tire of watching; it is a grand and glorious sea epic, with examples of courage and bravado, and a tumultuous battle sequence, as well as a film with great depth and meaning. The details of ""this little wooden world"" that is the English ship, as it chases a French man-of-war around the coast of South America in 1805, through the stormy Cape Horn, and finally landing in the Galapagos Islands, are astounding.  One gets the feeling of what it must have been like for the seamen in such close quarters for months on end. This is one of director Peter Weir's very finest works, in a career that has been replete with great stories told brilliantly on film.Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Jack Aubrey. His charismatic and virile presence fills the screen, and he is the perfect model of a heroic 19th century sea warrior. I always admire how Crowe subtly uses his voice to fit the part, a talent that is rare in actors these days. Equally excellent is Paul Bettany as the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Bettany will be remembered from his part in ""The Beautiful Mind,"" the film that garnered Crowe an Oscar), and the interaction between these 2 extraordinary actors make for some memorable scenes. Another notable performance comes from Max Pirkis (recently seen as Octavian in the HBO series ""Rome""), as the young Midshipman Blakeney.The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a marvel, especially the scenes in the Galapagos Islands, with its unique landscapes and strange creatures, and the soundtrack is a delight, using many lovely classical pieces, among them Bach's Cello Suite # 1, and Corelli's Concerto Grosso # 6. I recently viewed the Full Screen Edition of this film, which focuses on the expressiveness of the acting with its larger close-ups, and found it gave an added dimension to the film; I would recommend buying the Widescreen Edition, and perhaps renting the Full Screen Edition for additional viewing. ""Master and Commander"" is one of the most mature, satisfying, and engrossing films in recent years, not to be missed by anyone who enjoys adventure, along with a well-written script, intelligent characters, and the finest acting. Total running time is 138 minutes.",5,"""This Ship is England!""",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2228,"['Master', 'Commander', 'film', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'grand', 'glorious', 'sea', 'epic', 'examples', 'courage', 'bravado', 'tumultuous', 'battle', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'great', 'depth', 'meaning', 'details', 'little', 'wooden', 'world', 'English', 'ship', 'French', 'man-of-war', 'coast', 'South', 'America', '1805', 'stormy', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'finally', 'landing', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'are', 'astounding', 'One', 'feeling', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'seamen', 'such', 'close', 'quarters', 'months', 'end', 'one', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'very', 'finest', 'works', 'career', 'been', 'replete', 'great', 'stories', 'told', 'brilliantly', 'film.Russell', 'Crowe', 'superb', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'charismatic', 'virile', 'presence', 'screen', 'perfect', 'model', 'heroic', '19th', 'century', 'sea', 'warrior', 'always', 'admire', 'how', 'Crowe', 'subtly', 'voice', 'fit', 'part', 'talent', 'rare', 'actors', 'days', 'Equally', 'excellent', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Bettany', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'part', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'film', 'garnered', 'Crowe', 'Oscar', 'interaction', '2', 'extraordinary', 'actors', 'make', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'notable', 'performance', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'recently', 'seen', 'Octavian', 'HBO', 'series', 'Rome', 'young', 'Midshipman', 'Blakeney.The', 'cinematography', 'Russell', 'Boyd', 'marvel', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'unique', 'landscapes', 'strange', 'creatures', 'soundtrack', 'delight', 'using', 'many', 'lovely', 'classical', 'pieces', 'Bach', 'Cello', 'Suite', '1', 'Corelli', 'Concerto', 'Grosso', '6', 'recently', 'viewed', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'film', 'expressiveness', 'acting', 'larger', 'close-ups', 'found', 'gave', 'added', 'dimension', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'perhaps', 'renting', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'additional', 'viewing', 'Master', 'Commander', 'one', 'most', 'mature', 'satisfying', 'engrossing', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'who', 'adventure', 'well-written', 'script', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'finest', 'acting', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '138', 'minutes']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747791,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B00008W64E,Alejandro Cortes,"[3, 3]","""Master & Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" on the technical aspect is the only opponent for ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in the awards season. The level of detail that this movie presents is fantastic: the photography allows to see even the slightest detail of the ships used in this film. The cannonballs are so real that once in a while you might feel the need of dodging them. Russell Boyd, the cinematographer of ""Master & Commander"" did a great job, specially capturing on-screen the natural beauties of the Galapagos Islands and the vastness of the sea.However, the biggest problem in ""Master & Commander"" are the first 50 minutes of the movie. Requires patience because the rhythm it's kinda slow, so the audiences that like movies with the pace of a video-game (explosions every 5 minutes, MTV fast editing) should consider before watching this movie.For the rest of us that enjoy the development of a plot (even if the pace is slow), the final 80 minutes of the movie are the reward: the film becomes very interesting, the action scenes are incredible, the battles are very realistic, the characters become multidimensional persons, and the plot gets better and better every minute.On the technical aspect ""Master & Commander"" is excellent, but the performances are good. Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is very good as usual, but Paul Bettany is outstanding in the role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the best friend of the captain (perhaps Paul Bettany should have been nominated for best supporting actor). And a very pleasant surprise is the youngster Max Pirkis, as the charismatic Lord Blackeney, a kid that will win the sympathy of the audiences.""Master & Commander"" is a very interesting movie, a visual and sound feast. The sound effects are astonishing, the music is great (featuring music from Beethoven and Mozart).

747792,A3KMMXLJFQENDZ,B00008W64E,Alex A. Fintonis,"[2, 2]","In a film world were there seems to be a great deal of lacking high sea/historical maritime adventure, ""Master and Commander"" is highly welcomed.  I was lucky enough to sail on the schooner Appledore IV during the tall ships festival 2003.  During this experience I developed a huge passion for maritime history.  My dream is to someday sail aboard a 19th or 18th century man o war.  Who knows maybe one day?  Later that year ""Master and Commander was released in the theater and I was burning with anticipation.  I was not let down at all.  This movie had it all, action, drama, intrigue, pain, fear, excitement, and true friendship.  All these aspects would have been found on an English Man O War during the Napoleonic Wars.The film was purely fiction, based on Patrick O Brian's books, but as far as presenting what life was like on a warship for the English crown during 1805 it was dead on.  The uniforms, the language, and sailing techniques were nearly perfect.  Although the film is a fictional story it is presented historically enough that it could have easily happen.  Granted Hollywood added a little flare, but that's to be expected.I was getting a little tired of the classic pirate movie and was wanting more from Hollywood in the maritime department.  Do not get me wrong I think the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a fantastic time.  Moreover, I do have ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" to thank for bringing back maritime adventure.  If it weren't for that particular film ""Master and Commander"" would not have had nearly the draw it did.  But with that being said, I was very enthused to see a nautical film with a lot more history than fantasy.With all that has to be said about Russell Crowe, one cannot deny that he is an amazing actor.  He really envelops himself in every character he plays.  He actually made himself learn how to play the fiddle so it would be more authentic during the scenes he had to play.  Crowe was extremely believable as Captain Jack Aubery, although he was a bit more laid back than most British Captains of the early 19th century.  He would have been defiantly a captain I would have wanted to crew under.  I must also admit I have never read any of Patrick O Brian's books, something really need to do. So I cannot compare the two.  But for a film that represents life in the British navy during 1805 it did fantastic job.  I yearn for more films like this.  Who knows maybe one day I'll get that film about Lord Admiral Nelson I have always wanted to see.  Huzzah!",5,This time Surprise is on our side.

This is especially hard to find in American films, foreign directors such as Federico Fellini or Akiria Kurosawa had the ability to do many times over.When ""Master and Commander"" was first released I didn't want to see it. It's not that I thought it was good to be a bad film, but it just simply didn't appeal to my senses. I wasn't until I noticed both of the critics for our papers here in Chicago placed the movie on their ""top ten"" lists that I decided to see it.""Master and Commander"" is just a visual feast for the eyes. This is one of the few times I completely agree with the Academy. This movie deserved every nomination it received, well maybe except ""best picture"". But still, this is really an enetertaining film from beginning to end. The cinamatography, the sets, the production designs, visual effects, and the music, these are the real stars of the film. Without these things I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the movie as much as I do. All of these things come into place. They all add to the mood the film is trying to create. Almost everything here seems believeable.The plot in a movie like this really doesn't matter. The important thing to do is just sit back and relax. In fact I'm disappointed I didn't see this movie on the big screen. That must have been an experience.Russell Crowe plays Capt. Jack Audrey, a likeable captain who has the respect of his men. They soon find themselves under attack from a French ship. One that is bigger and has more men. That is a vague over view of this film. As I said the plot doesn't matter, I don't want to spend too much time discussing it.All of the acting is convicing. I found the relationship between Crowe and Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) to be very interesting. They are old friends and to me seem to be fighting for the other's respect. The doctor has no command on the ship but sometimes Aubrey listens to him.I've heard people say this is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far. But, this is a good old-fashion piece of Hollywood storytelling. Director Peter Weir has really accomplished something here.Bottom-line: Nominated for 10 Oscar, the film almost deserved every nomination. A perfect marriage for style and substance.

747797,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00008W64E,Amanda Richards,"[6, 6]","An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship ""Acheron"", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.The captain of the ""Acheron"" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004",4,Not simply messing about in boats,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,1980,"['essential', 'movie', 'collection', 'fan', 'things', 'nautical', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'cast', 'deliver', 'unforgettable', 'sea-faring', 'saga', 'fraught', 'danger', 'brim', 'full', 'human', 'interest.The', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'benefit', 'surround', 'sound', 'living', 'room', 'reverberated', 'hammering', 'nine', 'eighteen', 'pounders', 'creak', 'masts', 'flap', 'sail', 'sour', 'note', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'violin', 'could', 'be', 'clearly', 'heard', 'could', 'almost', 'smell', 'salty', 'air', 'other', 'senses', 'awakened', 'smell', 'taste', 'touch', 'what', 'eyes', 'ears', 'were', 'already', 'experiencing', 'Even', 'sixth', 'sense', 'perked', 'up', 'few', 'hours.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'vividly', 'enacted', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'scene', 'where', 'ship', 'becalmed', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'making', 'further', 'explanation', 'superfluous.Russell', 'Crowe', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'fearless', 'intelligent', 'compassionate', 'man', 'stubbornly', 'loyal', 'prepared', 'risk', 'everything', 'carry', 'out', 'orders', 'member', 'crew', 'time', 'teach', 'young', 'midshipmen', 'naval', 'procedure', 'musical', 'interludes', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'However', 'when', 'opportunity', 'combat', 'elusive', 'French', 'warship', 'Acheron', 'almost', 'ship', 'friendship', 'bitter', 'price', 'ambition.The', 'captain', 'Acheron', 'incessantly', 'outwitting', 'outplaying', 'outlasting', 'battle', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'resort', 'cunning', 'disguise', 'narrow', 'odds', 'turn', 'tide', 'battle.A', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'out', 'few', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'comfortable', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'also', 'know', 'nautical', 'terms', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'off', 'top', 'speed', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'port', 'starboard', 'Nautica', 'Sperry', 'may', 'need', 'interpreter', 'want', 'fully', 'absorb', 'movie.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '28', '2004']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

I think the fact that the set is so small, being the deck of a boat at sea, that it made it difficult to make the battles seem more real and exciting to watch.There is a lot going on between the two main characters, the captain and the ships doctor, one wants to advance science and the other wants to accomplish a goal, to beat his own demons by not letting go of his quest to capture an enemy vessel.I wish I could say this is a great movie and one to own for sure, but having just watched The Pirates of the Caribbean movie, with non stop action and adventure, it's hard to say I'd want to watch this one again in the near future.

He demonstrates how to inspire others to give their all in pursuit of a worthy cause, and shows the effective use of humor to relate to others, without becoming too familiar.On the ineffective side, you see Hollum, one of Aubrey's midshipman, whose personal qualities and decisions make him an ineffective leader, disliked by the men, and garnering negative reviews from his captain.The action is great -- and the Captain's ploys, deceptions and battle plans to outsmart the captain of another ship are phenomenal and intelligent.  Out gunned by a newer enemy ship, with twice the men, more guns, and a hull that can't be penetrated, Aubrey comes up with a plan that exploits his own capabilities and capitalizes on the few weaknesses of his opponent.

But the DVD special features aren't all that special when considering the cost of this ""special"" edition. Sure, you've got lots of documentaries, but let's face it, you've got that to choose from on most single-disc DVD sets these days if they're putting any kind of marketing into special features. Also, stunningly, I looked and checked and for some reason I guess I assumed there'd be some sort of actor's or director's commentary for this film. NOPE! This DVD package is highly overpriced and somewhat disappointing, akin to the film which I did not see in the theaters. There are some sweeping scenes and beautiful imagery, but some of the visual concepts were ripped right off from the 1984 epic, The Bounty, starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (still, probably the greatest nautical film ever shot, in my opinion). Master and Commander has some strengths but this could be one of the most overrated films in a long time. The crew seems too happy, even after getting their butts spanked by the frogs and Lucky Jack is just too jovial for the most part. This is one of Russel Crowe's weaker efforts and he seems to be too impressed with himself on screen with this work. I'd have given this a two and a half star rating if I could have figured out how to do the half-star thing. Master and Commander is to The Bounty what U-571 is to Das Boot.

None, however, catch the mood of ship board life as well as ""Master and Commander"".I would expect this film to rate well in the forthcoming Oscars.  Crowe's role is absolutely dominant. He is truly the master and commander in this seafaring epic.I have been told that the original book involved an American ship as the ""baddies"" but, to sell the story to the US market, a French ship was put in its place.  This has no impact on the overall film which is quite awe inspiring.Peter Weir's direction of the film is magnificent.

747810,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008W64E,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 7]","One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.I absolutely loved it.Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.Back to the film.I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected (""Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate."")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.",5,A truly inspiring naval adventure...,1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,4540,"['One', 'movies', 'grown', 'significant', 'amount', 'should', 'say', 'time', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'probably', 'personal', 'opinion', 'greatest', 'swashbuckling', 'sea', 'adventure', 'film', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Now', 'when', 'walked', 'theater', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way.I', 'was', 'supper', 'hyped', 'seeing', 'think', 'worship', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'should', 'see', 'shrine', 'have', 'bedroom', 'dedicated', 'thy', 'Holy', 'Crowe', 'so', 'was', 'there', 'opening', 'night', 'built', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'wound', 'up', 'nearly', 'falling', 'asleep', 'completely', 'giving', 'friends', 'constant', 'griping', 'concluded', 'was', 'dud', 'film', 'Problem', 'was', 'already', 'promised', 'father', 'would', 'see', 'next', 'day', 'so', 'braced', 'boredom', 'do', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'Crowe', 'do', 'anything', 'Get', 'middle', 'day', 'watched', 'film', 'new', 'eyes.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'it.Now', 'was', 'already', 'going', 'buy', 'film', 'regardless', 'feelings', 'said', 'WORSHIP', 'now', 'had', 'new', 'outlook', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipating', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'glorious', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'times', 'am', 'strongly', 'considering', 'watching', 'evening', 'wife', 'away', 'weekend', 'always', 'excuse', 'eat', 'pizza', 'drink', 'beer', 'watch', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'own', 'have', 'give', 'major', 'shout-out', 'extras', 'here', 'DVD', 'packed', 'are', 'amazing', 'should', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'coming', 'follow', 'reviews', 'then', 'know', 'never', 'discuss', 'extras', 'review', 'content', 'film', 'not', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'ignore', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'watch', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'find', 'thoroughly', 'engaging.Back', 'film.I', 'think', 'issue', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'was', 'impression', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'here', 'briskly', 'paced', 'non-stop', 'action', 'was', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Now', 'know', 'love', 'slow', 'brooding', 'character', 'studies', 'not', 'midnight', 'yes', 'went', 'midnight', 'showing', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'had', 'been', 'high', 'speed', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been.So', 'said', 'biggest', 'issue', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'entirely.Upon', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'many', 'can', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'high', 'seas', 'tale', 'beautiful', 'honesty', 'portrayal', 'sea', 'life', 'quiver', 'appreciation', 'also', 'genuine', 'sense', 'comradeship', 'really', 'basis', 'film', 'opinion', 'chemistry', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'really', 'simmering', 'beauty', 'film', 'natural', 'elegance', 'way', 'Crowe', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'feelings', 'crew', 'awkwardness', 'joke', 'much', 'grandfather', 'dinner', 'party', 'unsure', 'others', 'reactions', 'sure', 'own', 'need', 'tell', 'completely', 'endearing', 'Just', 'way', 'character', 'seep', 'delivery', 'making', 'word', 'seem', 'so', 'natural', 'almost', 'expected', 'Name', 'shrub', 'something', 'prickly', 'hard', 'eradicate', 'Matching', 'step', 'way', 'Bettany', 'who', 'completely', 'character', 'Stephen', 'rich', 'loyalty', 'constant', 'admiration', 'Even', 'when', 'Jack', 'Stephen', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'displeased', 'heart', 'Jack', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'strongly', 'performances', 'are', 'utterly', 'stunning', 'completely', 'deserving', 'praise.The', 'fact', 'were', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'disgusting', 'especially', 'when', 'hammy', 'Mystic', 'River', 'men', 'took', 'home', 'gold.Peter', 'Weir', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'creating', 'such', 'authentic', 'look', 'naval', 'life', 'love', 'way', 'creaks', 'wood', 'boat', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'frame', 'not', 'single', 'false', 'note', 'here', 'remarkable', 'tell', 'truth', 'totally', 'completely', 'remarkable.So', 'knowing', 'what', 'are', 'will', 'surely', 'heighten', 'appreciation', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'best', 'genre', 'more', 'best', 'world', 'cinema', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'form', 'focus', 'film', 'out', 'world', 'sea', 'life', 'ship', 'becoming', 'major', 'player', 'film']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Captian 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey is the Captian of the HMS Surprise, and he is the one surprised in the first battle scene, right at the start of the film.  Aubrey has the Surprise in search of the French Vessel Acheron, which  has found him, and lays into the Surprise a wallup of a battle.  Of note in the film is a young actor, Max Pirkis, who plays Lord Blakeney.  In the initial battle waged upon the Surprise, Blakeney is wounded in the arm and subsequently looses said arm.  This is a fairly dramatic scene in which his arm is amputated, a bit to close to home for me.  Pirkis' ability at the young age of 13 to act against Crowe and not be swalowed up and disappear was superb. Paul Bettany in his role as Dr. Stephen Maturin was quite brilliant, I could almost feel his child-like at at the all to brief but glorious beauty of the Galapagos Islands.  Someone wrote they thought some of the scenes looked cropped, as I am not a photographer, I could not tell, so I truly enjoyed the Islands scenes.  One of the more dramamtic scenes was seeing Bettany's Physician, after being shot and needing surgery, performs the surgery on himself, *shudder*.  All of the actors in Master and Commander fulfilled there roles with utter amazement.  You get a very good idea of the feelings that were clustered into the Man-O-Wars (ships) back then.  The ships were of close confinement and thus caused many fights, tifts, cliques and losses amongst fellow shipmates.As I have not read the books by Patrick O'Brian, so I can not attest to how closelynthe movie morrors the books.  But I do understand from people who have told me they read the books and saw the film, there are discprepancies, but most still quite enjoyed the film.  I will admit some scenes were not quite believable, but were not so far fetched as to seem ridiculous and loose believability in the film.  Overall it was extremely enjoyable by myself and my party,one of whom is a history buff.  I believe anyone who watches ""Master and Commander"" will walk away pleased.  I also think it will give renewed interest in Napoleonic History, especially in British ships and ship warfare.",5,"For the prize, and maybe the Oscars.",1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,2290,"['months', 'had', 'anticipated', 'coming', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'left', 'dissappointed', 'Captian', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Captian', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'one', 'surprised', 'first', 'battle', 'scene', 'right', 'start', 'film', 'Aubrey', 'Surprise', 'search', 'French', 'Vessel', 'Acheron', 'found', 'Surprise', 'wallup', 'battle', 'note', 'film', 'young', 'actor', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'who', 'Lord', 'Blakeney', 'initial', 'battle', 'waged', 'Surprise', 'Blakeney', 'wounded', 'arm', 'subsequently', 'looses', 'said', 'arm', 'fairly', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'arm', 'amputated', 'bit', 'close', 'home', 'Pirkis', 'ability', 'young', 'age', '13', 'act', 'Crowe', 'not', 'be', 'swalowed', 'up', 'disappear', 'was', 'superb', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'was', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'child-like', 'brief', 'glorious', 'beauty', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'Someone', 'wrote', 'thought', 'scenes', 'looked', 'cropped', 'am', 'not', 'photographer', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Islands', 'scenes', 'One', 'more', 'dramamtic', 'scenes', 'was', 'seeing', 'Bettany', 'Physician', 'being', 'shot', 'needing', 'surgery', 'surgery', '*shudder*', 'actors', 'Master', 'Commander', 'fulfilled', 'roles', 'utter', 'amazement', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'feelings', 'were', 'clustered', 'Man-O-Wars', 'ships', 'back', 'then', 'ships', 'were', 'close', 'confinement', 'thus', 'caused', 'many', 'fights', 'tifts', 'cliques', 'losses', 'amongst', 'fellow', 'shipmates.As', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'how', 'closelynthe', 'movie', 'morrors', 'books', 'do', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'told', 'read', 'books', 'saw', 'film', 'are', 'discprepancies', 'most', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'will', 'admit', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'believable', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'loose', 'believability', 'film', 'Overall', 'was', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'party', 'one', 'whom', 'history', 'buff', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'Master', 'Commander', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'pleased', 'also', 'think', 'will', 'give', 'renewed', 'interest', 'Napoleonic', 'History', 'especially', 'British', 'ships', 'ship', 'warfare']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case.

The movie picks up in the middle of the ocean with a preface of the ship's orders. From there they're suddenly attacked by a superior enemy. When the ship and crew are badly injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a dangerous chase across oceans, to capture his enemy.  The movie's acting and historical accuracy are it's strongest points. Crowe and Bettany are a joy to watch play off each other. The action and cinematography are amazing as well. It could easily get 5 stars but it just feels like there was more story to tell.

747814,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B00008W64E,Antonio Robert,"[0, 0]","In the year when the LOTR's ""Return of the King"" understandably reigned the big epic film productions, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" came as a pleasant surprise. In fact, it's not that surprising that the topic of naval battles in Napoleonic times (around 1805) got such a good treatment in the hands of down-under-born Peter Weir (""Truman Show"", ""Fearless"", ""Gallipoli"", ""The Year of Living Dangerously"").Weir's compatriot Russell Crowe is again very comfortable in a highly masculine role of Captain Jack Aubrey, an ambitious, skilled mariner who considers it the highest honour to pursue, to fight with and to beat the better-equipped French ship Acheron. The movie's battle scenes abound with realistic special effects, with the storm scene in the film's second half-hour being certainly among the best cinematic feats of its kind.But equally -- if not even more -- impressive are intimate portraits of Aubrey and ship surgeon Stephen Maturin (played exquisitely by relative newcomer Paul Bettany), who, although a good friend, is an antagonist character to Aubrey's, displaying nature-loving spirit and at times 'democratically' opposing Aubrey's leadership. Another endearing character is the young Lord Blackeney (Max Pirkis), who grows in both firsthand battlefield experience and touring Galapagos Islands to become either another great ship commander, or another scientist.Collective spirit, religiousness and patriotism of the English mariners add colour to the film and provide excellent food for thought for viewers. Occassional humour, unobtrusive yet tasteful music score and not an overdose of violence (although there is a fair share of it) makes this also a decent film for women. At times a bit slow, but overall a very enjoyable film, sporting beautiful cinematography and lessons in battle navigation, ""Master and Commander"" may in the future rank among the classics and has certainly enriched Weir's directorial canon already.",4,Thrilling Sail to The Far Side of the World,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1968,"['year', 'when', 'LOTR', 'Return', 'King', 'understandably', 'reigned', 'big', 'epic', 'film', 'productions', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'came', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'fact', 'not', 'surprising', 'topic', 'naval', 'battles', 'Napoleonic', 'times', '1805', 'got', 'such', 'good', 'treatment', 'hands', 'down-under-born', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Fearless', 'Gallipoli', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', '.Weir', 'compatriot', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'again', 'very', 'comfortable', 'highly', 'masculine', 'role', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'ambitious', 'skilled', 'mariner', 'who', 'highest', 'honour', 'pursue', 'fight', 'beat', 'better-equipped', 'French', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'movie', 'battle', 'scenes', 'realistic', 'special', 'effects', 'storm', 'scene', 'film', 'second', 'half-hour', 'being', 'certainly', 'best', 'cinematic', 'feats', 'kind.But', 'equally', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'are', 'intimate', 'portraits', 'Aubrey', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'who', 'good', 'friend', 'antagonist', 'character', 'Aubrey', 'displaying', 'nature-loving', 'spirit', 'times', ""'democratically"", 'opposing', 'Aubrey', 'leadership', 'endearing', 'character', 'young', 'Lord', 'Blackeney', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'who', 'firsthand', 'battlefield', 'experience', 'touring', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'become', 'either', 'great', 'ship', 'commander', 'scientist.Collective', 'spirit', 'religiousness', 'patriotism', 'English', 'mariners', 'add', 'colour', 'film', 'provide', 'excellent', 'food', 'thought', 'viewers', 'Occassional', 'humour', 'unobtrusive', 'yet', 'tasteful', 'music', 'score', 'not', 'overdose', 'violence', 'fair', 'share', 'also', 'decent', 'film', 'women', 'times', 'bit', 'slow', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'sporting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'lessons', 'battle', 'navigation', 'Master', 'Commander', 'may', 'future', 'rank', 'classics', 'certainly', 'enriched', 'Weir', 'directorial', 'canon', 'already']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

It's also possible that people who would really love this film won't see it because of this.Master and Commander runs close to being a character study. Not of Capt. Jack Aubrey, but the entire crew as an entity. The entire film (for the most part) takes place on the H.M.S. Surprise (Aubrey's ship), and the story is about this crew trying to hunt down an enemy ship of the French which is bigger, faster, has more guns with longer range, and more heavily armored. The story focuses on the lives of the characters aboard this ship during this mission, and time can often go for weeks on end without ever seeing the enemy. Just like a real ship in these times, the adventure is slow paced.However, those who appreciate strong dramas will find much to love about this picture. Both Crowe and Bettany give strong performances (as does everyone in this pic). Just like in Gladiator, Crowe gives a performance that really makes you believe these men would follow him. Bettany plays a civilian doctor and the only person Crowe doesn't have authority over allowing him to be the voice of reason as Jack Aubrey's desire to get this French ship verges on dangerous obsession.The fact that they don't make movies like this hardly ever is reason alone to catch this film on the big screen. In the next few years we're gonna have our fill of ancient greek/roman films, but it may be a very long time before we see a film like this again which is quite possibly the best of this type ever filmed.My one real complaint about the film was the ending. A twist is thrown in that caught me by surprise, but I really didn't like it because it not only invalidates most of the story up to that point but completely changes the tone of the film. Where up to that point the entire film is strong, realistic drama in the vein of Saving Private Ryan, the ending is something that would fit the light hearted antics of Pirates of the Caribbean.

Russell Crowe stars as Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is his friend and ship's surgeon as the ship battles a French phantom ship in this adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's series of books.  Some liberties are taken with the books, probably wisely; for instance, the protagonists battle the French during the Napoleonic wars rather than fighting the Americans in 1812.  Max Pirkis is excellent as a young seaman, and Billy Boyd does well in a small part as the crew fights for, and admires, their inspirational captain.

Anyone who enjoys action and drama will enjoy this film. It ranges from great battle scenes with the tang of salt spray to human drama. The primary plot involves a cat and mouse game, set in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars, between Captain Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) ship Surprise and his enemy a French ship Acheron.  The Acheron is by far the superior ship in speed, size, and firepower. Captain Aubrey has orders to take the Acheron, while the French seem all too aware of his orders. The chase passes around the tip of South America leaving the Atlantic and entering the Pacific Ocean where Acheron will raise money for Emperor Napoleon by raiding English whalers. The sailing is marvelously recreated.Along for the ride we experience sailing, sea tactics, and life on board a ship of this era. The apprenticeship approach to schooling officers during the Napoleonic era placed children on board fighting vessels. We even see a brief glimpse of a lesson in navigation Captain Aubrey is giving the young midshipmen. Life in harm's way as the sea becomes a battlefield spares neither young nor old. The crowding, stale food, and mental toll that are a fact of life on vessels that are at sea for long periods of time are graphically portrayed. The mood is lightened by the exhilaration of the hunt and moments of courage, kindness, and Aubrey's penchant for terrible puns, which fans of O'Brian's books will recognize.Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), the side kick of this famous duo, provides a counterpoint to Aubrey's sense of duty. Through him we see medicine of the period grope its way toward the future.  As an amateur naturalist, Dr. Maturin visits the Galapagos Islands much as Darwin would have during his famous trip on HMS Beagle 30 years after the 1805 date of the movie. In fact, Dr. Maturin's desire to visit the Islands becomes a source of conflict between himself and the single minded Aubrey. The resolution to the conflict is a measure of the friendship between Dr. Maturin and ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey.",5,The Battle Is On,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,2081,"['Master', 'Commander', 'not', 'just', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'fans', 'Anyone', 'who', 'action', 'drama', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'tang', 'salt', 'spray', 'human', 'drama', 'primary', 'plot', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'set', '1805', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'ship', 'Surprise', 'enemy', 'French', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'Acheron', 'far', 'superior', 'ship', 'speed', 'size', 'firepower', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'orders', 'take', 'Acheron', 'French', 'seem', 'too', 'aware', 'orders', 'chase', 'passes', 'tip', 'South', 'America', 'leaving', 'Atlantic', 'entering', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'where', 'Acheron', 'will', 'raise', 'money', 'Emperor', 'Napoleon', 'raiding', 'English', 'whalers', 'sailing', 'marvelously', 'recreated.Along', 'ride', 'experience', 'sailing', 'sea', 'tactics', 'life', 'board', 'ship', 'era', 'apprenticeship', 'approach', 'schooling', 'officers', 'Napoleonic', 'era', 'placed', 'children', 'board', 'fighting', 'vessels', 'even', 'see', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'lesson', 'navigation', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'giving', 'young', 'midshipmen', 'Life', 'harm', 'way', 'sea', 'battlefield', 'young', 'old', 'crowding', 'stale', 'food', 'mental', 'toll', 'are', 'fact', 'life', 'vessels', 'are', 'sea', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'are', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'mood', 'lightened', 'exhilaration', 'hunt', 'moments', 'courage', 'kindness', 'Aubrey', 'penchant', 'terrible', 'puns', 'fans', ""O'Brian"", 'books', 'will', 'recognize.Dr', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'side', 'kick', 'famous', 'duo', 'counterpoint', 'Aubrey', 'sense', 'duty', 'see', 'medicine', 'period', 'grope', 'way', 'future', 'amateur', 'naturalist', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'much', 'Darwin', 'would', 'have', 'famous', 'trip', 'HMS', 'Beagle', '30', 'years', '1805', 'date', 'movie', 'fact', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'desire', 'visit', 'Islands', 'source', 'conflict', 'single', 'minded', 'Aubrey', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'measure', 'friendship', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

It follows through on its promises, commits its characters to both the heroics and the sins of their natures, has the courage of its convictions and portrays nobility of spirit without maudlin sentiment. In short, it is a wonderful balancing act. The fact that it has intelligent plotting, literate dialogue, classical themes, inspired acting and is both well paced and superbly filmed only adds to its many virtues.Intelligent restraint is in evidence throughout this film. Peter Weir shows restraint in his decision to let the story tell itself. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany show restraint in their superb understated acting. Together, they are like a thinking person's Gene Rodenberry, Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy. Think of these archetypes stripped of their overacting and most egregious tendencies and you will have some idea of the qualities conveyed by the three principals in this film.The plot and setting have been well summarized in other reviews, but those are poor reasons to view a film such as ""Master and Commander"". It is really a film about timeless qualities now hopelessly out of fashion: things like duty, honour, loyalty, friendship, mutual reliance and the questing spirit. Cynics will hate this film for its proud and unapologetic portrayal of old fashioned values. The rest of us will not only love it, but find it inspirational.I am both hopeful and apprehensive of a sequel. On the one hand, I look forward to further adaptations of Peter O'Brien's work.

Since the movie is about life on the about, there better be some strong characters to carry the story.Russell Crowe does a good job as captian Jack Aubrey, although at times he seems to be just doing the normal things a captain would do (citing scriptures a crewman's funeral).  Aubrey seems to only be close to the officers and is good friends with the doctor.  To me the doctor on the ship is the best character, suffering an injury, and showing compassion for the crew and common sense when needed.The climactic action scene is exciting yet at the same time its hard to tell who is who and the scene ends in what seems like too short of time for what was actually accomplished.In the end, I enjoyed this movie in spite of the fact I found it hard to enjoy or empathize with any of the characters.

From the excellent costumes to the magnificent depiction of the sea and ships, from the sails unfurling in the wind, to the dark, tight spaces below deck, from the swinging hammocks, the fog, the gales, the guns, the flying debris, to the carpentry repairs, the piping bosun, the officers peering through their spyglasses, to even the flipping of the hourglass, all elements of the story are presented in masterful detail and drama.The film itself, like the books it's based on, is a bit challenging, involving and intense. Many times during surgical operations and battle maneuvers, I was clenching my teeth and holding my breath. It does offer some mild humor but it's more of an action film with a sense of seriousness. What engages the attention nicely are some of the ingenious stratagems played out. Which keep the film from being just repetitive battle, blood and destruction, as obvious as that might later seem. But really the film presents much more than that and brings to life some truly noble characters. Touching issues in discipline, sacrifice, pride or how ""the power of authority corrupts"" regarding the call of duty. And when those who died in close combat where buried at sea, the Our Father prayer was solemnly recited, creating a poignant effect to the overall picture, though it is not a religious film in the outright.The music takes on a different kind of importance with this film. There is the jovial type of sea chanteys sung by the shipmates, but the strategic segments of classical strings incorporated, as a strong element is likely the most powerful. Brought to life visually by the two main characters themselves. This becomes a fitting signature of the story, making the motion picture and score unique in it's own.Like the novel by Patrick O'Brian, the nautical interest is what drew me to the film. There alone I was not disappointed, but amazingly impressed. And at some scenes I even wanted to clap for the good performance.

Russell Crowe is mesmerizing as the British captain, Jack Aubrey.  Aubrey's ship doctor and friend, brilliantly played by Paul Bettany (in quite a departure from his role in ""A Beautiful Mind""), provides all sorts of dramatic tension you wouldn't expect in a typical high-seas adventure film.  But this film is not typical: beyond the basic plot of a high-stakes naval cat-and-mouse game, it is a film about duty-duty to country, to crew, to a friend, to one's self.  As Aubrey's mission unfolds, all these various duties come into conflict, and it is in how he resolves them that the true magnificence of his character is revealed.

For several years now we've had high resolution digital audio for our music, but only over the last two years has it finally hit the video market. Master and Commander on DVD was a disc I was impressed with for the quality of the 768Mbps dts track, but good Lord the improvement of this Blu-ray track is seven-fold. I continue to be impressed by the sound quality on Fox's discs, including Independence Day, I, Robot, The Day After Tomorrow, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and now Master and Commander. This is what home theatre is about! All speakers are in use here and the directionality is spot on. I truly believe I have cannons beside my sofa, powerful, heavy cannons. Not for the faint of heart is this one at reference level volumes.Where picture quality is concerned there are one or two scenes that I did find to be not eye-popping, but these are few and far between. On the DVD release of Master and Commander there are many scenes in the ship under-deck that are a mess, with mpeg-noise all over the place, a shortcoming of DVD's bandwidth. On the Blu-ray Disc you'll find no such errors. The level of detail watching this movie on a 1080p plasma is incredible and there are no complaints whatsoever of the day scenes. Although this will not compare when stood beside the sheen of I, Robot, one of the most incredible pictures I've experienced so far on Blu-ray, it definitely is a huge improvement over its DVD counterpart.Fox have made very little effort here with the extras, but have included D-Box functionality for those with a bit more money to spend on their theatre seating. That is not something I can afford so I can't comment on it, but D-Box tracks are starting to catch the attention of the other studios and you will see Disney or Sony Blu-ray's coming soon with D-Box tracks. If you want to go more into the history of the time there are numerous special features on the DVD, but with the movie already running 137 minutes this is one reviewer that has yet to ever pop in that second disc, ever. Missing out on porting over the DVD extras is something a lot of reviewers, amateur and professional, gripe about. I do not care for extras if they are in standard definition. I have all three of the Lord of the Rings Platinum Edition 4-DVD sets, I bought them because of the 6.1 dts:es tracks and the extended footage. That amounts to 6 DVD's that have never been released from their plastic teeth. I will likely watch some of them when the inevitable Blu-ray Disc versions come out if they are in 1080p, but otherwise I just don't have the time to watch that much extra footage about each movie I buy. Master and Commander is a pretty incredible movie with excellent performances all round and the subject matter is interesting, but when the movie's over, turn out the lights.I dock Fox 1-star for not including the extras for those that have never bought the original DVD, but this release for the sheer improvement of audio and picture quality and being able to enjoy this on a large screen that even the best up-converter for DVD's cries beside, gets 4-stars.For those wishing to wait for the ""inevitable"" double dip, consider renting this title from your local Blockbuster or Netflix, you'll not be disappointed.Picture Quality - 4/5Sound Quality - 5/5 (Reference!)Extras - 1/5",4,"If you're not a fan of extras, the PQ/SQ upgrade makes this a must have Blu-ray Disc",1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,3457,"['opening', 'cannon', 'battle', 'visceral', 'sound', 'design', 'know', ""'re"", 'treat', 'dts-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'presentation', 'Fox', 'several', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'had', 'high', 'resolution', 'digital', 'audio', 'music', 'only', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'finally', 'hit', 'video', 'market', 'Master', 'Commander', 'DVD', 'was', 'disc', 'was', 'impressed', 'quality', '768Mbps', 'dts', 'track', 'good', 'Lord', 'improvement', 'Blu-ray', 'track', 'seven-fold', 'continue', 'be', 'impressed', 'sound', 'quality', 'Fox', 'discs', 'including', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Robot', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Rise', 'Silver', 'Surfer', 'now', 'Master', 'Commander', 'what', 'home', 'theatre', 'speakers', 'are', 'use', 'here', 'directionality', 'spot', 'truly', 'believe', 'have', 'cannons', 'beside', 'sofa', 'powerful', 'heavy', 'cannons', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'one', 'reference', 'level', 'volumes.Where', 'picture', 'quality', 'concerned', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'not', 'eye-popping', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'DVD', 'release', 'Master', 'Commander', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'ship', 'under-deck', 'are', 'mess', 'mpeg-noise', 'place', 'shortcoming', 'DVD', 'bandwidth', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', ""'ll"", 'find', 'such', 'errors', 'level', 'detail', 'watching', 'movie', '1080p', 'plasma', 'incredible', 'are', 'complaints', 'whatsoever', 'day', 'scenes', 'will', 'not', 'compare', 'when', 'stood', 'sheen', 'Robot', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'so', 'far', 'Blu-ray', 'definitely', 'huge', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'counterpart.Fox', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'here', 'extras', 'have', 'included', 'D-Box', 'functionality', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'spend', 'theatre', 'seating', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'afford', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'D-Box', 'tracks', 'are', 'starting', 'catch', 'attention', 'other', 'studios', 'will', 'see', 'Disney', 'Sony', 'Blu-ray', 'coming', 'soon', 'D-Box', 'tracks', 'want', 'go', 'more', 'history', 'time', 'are', 'numerous', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'movie', 'already', 'running', '137', 'minutes', 'one', 'reviewer', 'yet', 'ever', 'pop', 'second', 'disc', 'ever', 'Missing', 'out', 'porting', 'over', 'DVD', 'extras', 'something', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'amateur', 'professional', 'gripe', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'extras', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', 'have', 'three', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Platinum', 'Edition', '4-DVD', 'sets', 'bought', '6.1', 'dts', 'es', 'tracks', 'extended', 'footage', '6', 'DVD', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'plastic', 'teeth', 'will', 'likely', 'watch', 'when', 'inevitable', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', 'versions', 'come', 'out', 'are', '1080p', 'otherwise', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'much', 'extra', 'footage', 'movie', 'buy', 'Master', 'Commander', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'round', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting', 'when', 'movie', 'turn', 'out', 'lights.I', 'dock', 'Fox', '1-star', 'not', 'including', 'extras', 'have', 'never', 'bought', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'sheer', 'improvement', 'audio', 'picture', 'quality', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'large', 'screen', 'even', 'best', 'up-converter', 'DVD', 'cries', 'beside', '4-stars.For', 'wishing', 'wait', 'inevitable', 'double', 'dip', 'consider', 'renting', 'title', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'Netflix', ""'ll"", 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.Picture', 'Quality', '4/5Sound', 'Quality', '5/5', 'Reference', 'Extras', '1/5']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

If you're a philosopher, you probably believe that it is nature.  If you're religious, it's probably divinity.  And if you are in military service, it's probably the government.  If you're Stephen Maturin -- the surgeon and naturalist on board the ship, played very well by Paul Bettany -- you probably feel that your ""Master and Commander"" is the first in that list.  If you're Jack Aubrey -- the captain on board the ship, and played even better by Russell Crowe -- you probably feel obligation to the last two.I got a real feeling for the Theory of Evolution here, especially since the crew makes a trip to the Galapagos Islands.  I'm not sure if this film is set before Charles Darwin came up with his ""On the Origin of Species,"" but no matter.  I'm sure that people way before him were thinking about some of these same things, and Mr. Maturin seems to fit that bill.  He wants to know why some birds on the island have insufficient wings for flight; why some insects look like sticks; why all of the species there have changed to fit their environment.  He's thinking about the ""natural order of things,"" or perhaps ""the survival of the fittest"" already, perhaps even before Mr. Darwin.But Captain Aubrey is thinking about the same themes, but from a different perspective.  To him, the survival of the fittest involves humans in combat.  After all, humans are animals, and if only the strong survive amongst non-human animals, why should the same not apply with humans as well?  We evolve too, perhaps more in intelligence than anything else.  (I'm not sure modern-day man is all that intelligent, but I digress.)Mr. Crowe reminds me of Captain Kirk here a bit from ""Star Trek,"" although Mr. Crowe's character isn't chasing women across the galaxy, but is rather chasing another ship across the ocean.  And Mr. Crowe uses his intelligence at least once to gain advantage over another, just like Captain Kirk would always seem to do.  And this happens around about the time that our two main characters seem to finally start truly understanding and respecting each other; after all, before that, each has his own priorities, and each has his own ""master and commander,"" and those ""masters and commanders"" seem to be mutually exclusive.But with Mr. Crowe, it would be only the natural order of things for him to give a fine performance in a fine movie.

No doubt fans of the ""Hornblower"" DVD sets will like this movie. Any fans of classics like ""Damn the Defiant"" with Alec Guinness should find it entertaining.Russell Crowe does a fine job of portraying the captain of a British ship in search of the French enemy. His enemy is a worthy quarry and must be tracked to the ends of the Earth. Even when you think the movie is concluded you find it is not. The acting is excellent and they did a fine job of casting.The real treat is the photography and sets. The level of detail is phenomenal. Rarely have I seen such attention to what helps to make a great seafaring movie, a great ship set. The ambiance of sea life is so well preserved you will think you are smelling the sea breeze and feel the salty spray across your face. That or you will feel cramped and smell the sweat and powder below decks as they engage the enemy.The DVDs included in this are first quality and the picture and sound is excellent. It includes numerous extras you can find listed under the details above. All in all this movie was masterfully done.I initially rated this four stars. I would change that to three if I could now. The reason is the more I reflected on this movie I realized I wouldn't be likely to watch it again for some time. What I mean is it does not have a great deal of replayability. The reason is that I wasn't happy with the constant chasing of only one quarry and then even at the end the chase starts all over again.

Costuming and period detail is quite perfect. The scenes of the Officer's meals in the Captain's cabin are very entertaining, as are those of the seaman. Scenes of the Galapagos Islands add much to the movie and help flesh out the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin. The heavy weather scenes as the Surprise rounds the Horn are very realistic and frightening to a sailor like myself. The harsh life of the Royal Navy is well depicted.

Hundreds more on the wonderful early color sets that seemed to favor enhancing the RED spectrum over the other two. Of course, I can not forget the handful I got to watch through the steamy car windows while parked at a local Drive-In, and those I saw through the smoke filled air while seated beside my older brother and younger sister stuck to the candy covered seats of graceful old theaters.Then, in the late '70's, I can remember talk of this WONDERFUL new invention, soon to be in every American's Living-room: The BETA VCR!""WOW! What an amazing idea."" I thought. But then snidely snapped, ""How stupid can these guys get?! Only a moron would sit and watch the SAME movie over and over!

It leapt beyond my expectations in the first 15 minutes, revealing itself to be was a rich, amazing view of a long ago world. A world where little boys shouldered the weight of manhood with courage and fortitude. Where friendships held through horrendous test. Where the wit, heart, love, and passion of all characters involved were intricately, and heart wrenchingly revealed.

747849,A2DF325SNSGH2R,B00008W64E,Cedric's Mom,"[3, 5]","Master and Commander is a pretty good movie about naval warfare and tall ships in the early 19th century.  Russell Crowe plays Captian ""Lucky Jack"" of the British ship Surprise. The mission is to destroy the French vessel Acheron, under Napoleon's reign. In this quest, we are shown what it was like to sail tall ships and what warfare was like in the 1800s.I haven't read Patrick O'Brien's novels, but I love the romance and excitement of seafaring adventure.  Like-minded individuals won't be disappointed, although the movie may be a bit less rough sailing than expected. The trailer to the movie shows the Surprise in the thick of battle and during very rough seas, but we needn't ask ourselves ""what happened when the sea was at a dead calm?"" We see that as well.This movie will thrill history buffs, too, because we get to see how things were done, what it was like to sustain injury and be treated, and the daily life of being  a sailor in her majesty's royal navy.  It was a brutal way of life and that's evident in the movie, especially when you consider that the British Navy was superior to all others in the 19th century, so it's probably safe to assume that their ships and practices were the highest standard of the time.There are many surprises in this movie-the remarkable youth of some of the sailors, how certain nautical methods and terms came to be, tactical techniques, and a very pleasant but abbreviated visit to the Galapagos Islands. But what I found most surprising was the moral slant of this movie. First of all, Captain ""Lucky Jack"" is the most benevolent of captains, a dedicated but fair and compassionate man.  There are several scenes where the captain has cause to give his men moral direction and guidance. He is deeply moved upon the tragic and sacrificial death of one of his sailors.  He asks his friend and co-star Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's doctor, ""have the men indicated to you how they are feeling?"" Would a Navy captain react that way, especially in the 19th century, with such humanity and concern for his men's emotional state?  I mean, isn't death, suffering, and loss a foregone conclusion in battle? These scenes felt to me more like a bit of modernizing than historical accuracy, but what do I know? I've never been in the navy.  The story itself is tightly focused; notice how the object of the movie is to overtake the Achelon and yet we never see what goes on with that French vessel. The story is about the men of the Surprise, and that's where our focus is kept.Another very pleasant surprise for this music lover is Ralph Vaughan Williams ""Tallis Fantasia,"" used to great emotional effect in several key scenes.In all, Master and Commander is definitely worth full price, if for no other reason than to see the sea at her wildest on the big screen.  These scenes will make you lean forward in your seat, secure and thankful that it isn't *you* on the ship's deck or hanging from sail ropes.  The movie felt more like an ensemble movie; if there's a star here, it's the story itself.  You won't get the emotional impact of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and it won't stick to your ribs the way that masterpiece did, but it's still a pretty good movie. If this type of movie is your idea of a good time, don't wait for the video to come out. Get the full experience.

747851,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B00008W64E,Charismatic Creature,"[5, 10]","....SERIOIUSLY. Take a few minutes and think about this before rejecting it as a silly intepretation. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is extremely similar to Captain Kirk in both appearance and temperment...you know the beloved-by-the-crew even though he's tough  guy, who tends to act impulsively but manages to triumph over seemingly impossible odds, over and over. Dr. Maturin (Paul Bettany) is a sort of combo of Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy -- the brilliant humanitarian and almost miraculously gifted physician PLUS natural scientist and curious-seeker whose personality is constantly being contrasted against the Captains. Add a ""salty"" crew of unremarkable sailors -- seemingly there for the sole duty of being bumped off and then quickly forgotten. Oh and let's not forget a stalwart ship with plenty of personality...It may sound near to impossible, but keep in mind that the Aubrey-Maturin series BEGAN in 1970, after Star Trek had finished it's three year run as a TV show. There was plenty of Horatio Hornblower adapted into Star Trek, so it's probably ""turnabout as fair play"" to see a historical writer -- otherwise consumed with accurate historical detail -- who was so heavily influenced by popular culture!While watching this film, I couldn't get this concept out of my head as the dialogue and situations just kept reminding me of Star Trek over and over again. However, I want to be perfectly fair to the movie -- it's highly enjoyable with superb special effects that make the ship and it's isolation out in the ocean very convincing. The depiction of the really tough, dirty, cramped conditions that the sailors live in is also done in an outstanding manner. Battle scenes, etc. are all superbly staged and photographed.The weaknesses largely come from the problem of combining TWO of Patrick O'Brien's excellent seafaring books into one film. Why? Wasn't ONE enough? And then changing the historical details, such as having the enemy vessel be FRENCH (yeah, I guess we are still busy getting even with France) instead of American. I guess the filmmakers couldn't concieve of an US audience accepting an American ship being defeated by a British one! even with the historical reality that Britain ruled the seas at this time.Crowe and Bettany turn in fine performances, even if channeling old Star Trek characters, and young actor Max Pirkis does a outstanding job as a adolescent sailor who loses and arm and becomes an important addition to the crew. Although the presence of so many very tender looking young boys brings up the ugly question of sexual abuse under this kind of isolated circumstance -- something that was a reality in the British Navy at the time -- and it's completely glossed over here. The boys are treated with real fatherliness by Captain Aubrey, which is very charming but probably totally unrealistic.If you enjoyed the PBS series Horatio Hornblower, or really any old movie that dealt with period sailing ships and the seafaring life, this movie will appeal to you. It was by far one of the most memorable films of 2003, and I think only missed winning awards because of heavy competition from LOTR.",3,Star Trek on the High Seas...,1080691200,"03 31, 2004",2004,3139,"['.SERIOIUSLY', 'Take', 'few', 'minutes', 'think', 'rejecting', 'silly', 'intepretation', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'extremely', 'similar', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'appearance', 'temperment', 'know', 'beloved-by-the-crew', 'even', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'act', 'impulsively', 'triumph', 'over', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'odds', 'over', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'sort', 'combo', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'brilliant', 'humanitarian', 'almost', 'miraculously', 'gifted', 'physician', 'PLUS', 'natural', 'scientist', 'curious-seeker', 'personality', 'constantly', 'being', 'contrasted', 'Captains', 'Add', 'salty', 'crew', 'unremarkable', 'sailors', 'seemingly', 'sole', 'duty', 'being', 'bumped', 'then', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'Oh', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'stalwart', 'ship', 'plenty', 'personality', 'may', 'sound', 'impossible', 'keep', 'mind', 'Aubrey-Maturin', 'series', 'BEGAN', '1970', 'Star', 'Trek', 'had', 'finished', 'three', 'year', 'run', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'plenty', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'adapted', 'Star', 'Trek', 'probably', 'turnabout', 'fair', 'play', 'see', 'historical', 'writer', 'otherwise', 'consumed', 'accurate', 'historical', 'detail', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'popular', 'culture', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'concept', 'head', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'just', 'kept', 'reminding', 'Star', 'Trek', 'over', 'again', 'However', 'want', 'be', 'perfectly', 'fair', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'ship', 'isolation', 'ocean', 'very', 'convincing', 'depiction', 'really', 'tough', 'dirty', 'cramped', 'conditions', 'sailors', 'live', 'also', 'done', 'outstanding', 'manner', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'etc', 'are', 'superbly', 'staged', 'photographed.The', 'weaknesses', 'largely', 'come', 'problem', 'combining', 'TWO', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'excellent', 'seafaring', 'books', 'one', 'film', 'Why', 'Was', ""n't"", 'ONE', 'enough', 'then', 'changing', 'historical', 'details', 'such', 'having', 'enemy', 'vessel', 'be', 'FRENCH', 'yeah', 'guess', 'are', 'still', 'busy', 'getting', 'even', 'France', 'instead', 'American', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'concieve', 'US', 'audience', 'accepting', 'American', 'ship', 'being', 'defeated', 'British', 'one', 'even', 'historical', 'reality', 'Britain', 'ruled', 'seas', 'time.Crowe', 'Bettany', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'even', 'channeling', 'old', 'Star', 'Trek', 'characters', 'young', 'actor', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'outstanding', 'job', 'adolescent', 'sailor', 'who', 'arm', 'important', 'addition', 'crew', 'presence', 'so', 'many', 'very', 'tender', 'looking', 'young', 'boys', 'up', 'ugly', 'question', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'kind', 'isolated', 'circumstance', 'something', 'was', 'reality', 'British', 'Navy', 'time', 'completely', 'glossed', 'here', 'boys', 'are', 'treated', 'real', 'fatherliness', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'very', 'charming', 'probably', 'totally', 'unrealistic.If', 'enjoyed', 'PBS', 'series', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'really', 'old', 'movie', 'dealt', 'period', 'sailing', 'ships', 'seafaring', 'life', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'was', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', '2003', 'think', 'only', 'missed', 'winning', 'awards', 'heavy', 'competition', 'LOTR']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

It is of course these things, but the subtle human dramas and richly-drawn characters give the film as much power and energy as the raging oceans it is played out on.Perhaps the best story in this Peter Weir masterpiece is that between the ship's doctor, played wonderfully by Paul Bettany, and the formidable but equally human Captain Aubrey, of course played by Russell Crowe, who just oozes with honor, courage and nobility in this role.Chasing the French ""phantom ship"", the Acheron, from Brazil to the Galapagos Islands becomes a side story to the relationship between the doctor and commander, who come to realize that, as men, they are not as different as they outwardly appear. Captain Aubrey's steadfast commitment to duty, order and discipline closely mirrors the doctor's passionate hold on science, discovery and his strong sense of morality and reason.

Mazza.The film is about as realistic in setting as one could make it. There are a few inconsistencies in the sailing, but only noticeable to an experienced sailor - they don't take away from the film anyway.The film catches the right balance between focusing on the crew and its adventures and daily life, versus the Napoleonic Wars. In otherwords, no need to be a student of that period to understand or appreciate the movie.There is no romance, which has probably hurt the film in terms of broad popularity; perhaps in the same sense of the movie ""Tora Tora Tora !"" from the 70s. It was one of the best war films ever made (subjective, I know:). Point is, both are 'limited' by lack of romance in their plots. The two share excellent settings and historical research.I will point out that M&C; distinctively shows the antecedents of 'modern' military leadership: the Capt must balance his personal ambitions with care for the crew, he must coach the young midshipmen (Hollom, Blakeney, Callamy, etc), and use a persuasion to get the sailing master and more experienced Officers and crew to follow him in dire situations.

I thought, ""Nice, but I'm not sure if I care.""But recently I caught it during a showing on HBO, on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon and watching it was like a completely different experience for me.  It's actually far less opaque than I first thought it was -- it's a carefully measured yarn -- and I'm not sure what made me enjoy more than before, if it was the comfortable home setting or the repeat viewing or the fact that its 2.40:1 aspect ratio had been pared down to 1.33 (I'm a complete purist when it comes to watching widescreen movies in letterboxed format but... I'm afraid to say that the pan-and-scanning may have scaled the movie back to a less intimidating level for me; and I did, however, immediately buy a used copy at Ballbuster and watch the movie again in its proper aspect ratio).Whatever the reasons, I'm now a big of the movie and although earlier I'd thought Peter Weir was just doing a quick paycheck action movie, I see now how complicated a feat the movie was in terms of condensing the material and the logistics of filming large boats with a large crew in lots of different locations.

747858,A4YLFRSBBC3RZ,B00008W64E,classicmoviefan,"[2, 3]","I agree with the other 5 star reviews of this film here on Amazon.com that this film IS highly entertaining... for those seeking action and ALSO for those who love a good story with lots of character study... and in those areas, this film will not disappoint... but I am also have a great passion for the recreation of history, in spirit if not in literal terms... and this film is right ""on target"". It is a work of art consistant with history from the first frame (sensitively designed title text), to the the finale.I was fortunate to be able to visit the HMS SURPRISE (actually built in 1970 as a replica of a 1750s British warship called the ROSE) used in this film. It is currently docked in San Diego harbour and open to the public. I saw it prior purchasing the DVD. I stood on the actual deck and examined the recreated planking, rigging and details on board, and even up close, it is like stepping back in history... it looks so carefully outfitted. Below deck is a display of the film's costumes, musical instruments and props used in the film behind glass showcased walls, and they are remarkable. The costumes are authentic down to the delicate hand sewn details, the brass with perfect patina, and the china and silver table service looks museum quality... most of it recreated just for this film.It was no surprise that with such attention to detail, the film has such an authentic look on screen, but what ultimately won my praise for this film was the respect for the ""correctness"" in manners, gesture and story the actors showed here.  Whether it was minutely accurate is not important, but with so many films now on DVD that simply do not care about the historic look or beauty of period film or costume (""Shanghai Knights"" and ""First Knight"" immediately come to mind) it was great to see a work on film that displayed the texture and look of past in such authentic way.  The music, much of it classical, is not all of the period, yet it still felt ""right"" for the film and adds to the sweeping vistas and first rate cinematography... which is remarkable in this filim.I loved the story, I also thought the characters were wonderfully developed. Crowe is marvelous... and his character showed the intensity, power, determination, loyalty, that a captain would have had... and yet also the sensitive nature and a bit of humor that would have kept his crews loyalty through horrendous times. His portrayal is on a par with his performance in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Gladiator"".There were many reasons to love this film... overall it is a real adventure.

747861,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00008W64E,C. Middleton,"[4, 5]","This film is a wonderful story taken from the novel's by Patrick O'Brian. One can think of other well-made classic maritime films such as Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, and my other favourite, Horatio Hornblower, starring Gregory Peck. These films will always be classics, as they have withstood the test of time, as Master and Commander will most certainly do in the future.This high praise comes from the obvious, as this film is almost flawless in many respects, artistically, technically and its historical realism. However this unqualified praise really comes from the fact that my expectations before finally viewing the film were actually quite low. In fact, up until a few months ago, I had totally overlooked that Peter Weir was the film's director, and this man has proven himself to be one of the current greats in Hollywood. His past triumphs, such as Witness, staring Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was one of the top ten films made in the eighties. Considering my expectations were nothing to speak of, Master and Commander turned out to be a great surprise.For the most part this film is a story about leadership, courage, tenacity, friendship, honour and loyalty. And this is all done in the film without having to resort to unnecessary sentimentalism or platitudes. Captain Jack Aubrey is the manifestation or epitome of all these virtues and more. What an inspiring character. Russell Crowe delivered a believable performance as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot;. Crowe has a tremendous amount of presence in front of the camera, which is the exact skill or gift necessary to play this particular character. If anything, most if not all the performances in this film were first rate.The soundtrack, too, was appropriate for the film. As a classical music admirer and listener, for once I've been prompted to purchase the recording (which doesn't happen often) as well as the DVD to add to the library. Master and Commander is an &quot;all-rounder&quot; and will be a pleasure to watch many times over.

747865,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B00008W64E,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[5, 6]","Master And Commander shares with Crowe's earlier movie Gladiator something rare in contemporary filmmaking.  Both films actually tell us a story about people and worlds unfamiliar to us.  Too often in ""historical"" films although the dress and settings are in the past the characters display attitudes, beliefs and conflicts that reflect more modern concerns.  What we often get are contemporary ""morality plays"" acted out in costume dramas in either a past age or in outer space.  These have their value but often fail as storytelling.Master And Commander is a tale of a world (Napoleonic seafaring warfare) in which the characters hold to values and loyalties we do not immediately grasp.  Crowe as Aubrey drives this story according to the imperatives of command.  To succeed in a mission against a superior opponent with whom he is horribly mismatched, Crowe must summon courage, determination, and shrewdness to avoid defeat several times to finally triumph.  The ship's surgeon (Paul Bettany) serves as Aubrey's best friend and sometime conscience questioning Aubrey several times whether he is pursuing his quest against the French warship out of a sense of loyalty and duty or because his pride.  Is Aubrey preserving his self-respect at the expense of the crew's welfare?The truth is (as in all of us) Aubrey's motives are mixed.  While he does act out of a need to do his duty as England herself is threatened with invasion, Aubrey also does not want to be bested by a French captain.  Still, while his motives may be tainted, Aubrey is not dissuaded from the fight.  Yet any suspicions that the ship's surgeon himself was counseling out of weakness and lack of courage are dispelled in the events to follow.This is no simple tale of triumph.  The harshness of sea life and the absolute ruthless measures used to maintain order under primitive conditions are not slighted.  The good men are inhumanely sacrificed to save the ship.  Those who fail to do their duty are mercilessly whipped to uphold authority.  Battle at sea is show not so much as gallant rivalry as the savage butchery it was.  Finally, the heavy loss of life of seaman and officer alike in combat shows that success and doing one's duty are quite costly.It is a certain kind of courage to do something difficult.  It takes a different kind of courage to meet a challenge when there is a real possibility and likelihood one will lose.  Would we have thought it worth the sacrifice and pain to capture just one ship from all the oceans of the world?  Could we have driven others under our responsibility to suffer so much for any goal?  Maybe not.  But Master And Commander shows us men who did and a world we have largely forgotten.  This is an excellent movie that you will watch several times and catch something new each time.  Can we have another film to follow this one?

The Royal Navy had such a tradition by 1805 (the year of this film) that its ships really were little floating islands of England.

These thoughts went through my head after watching ""Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World"" because the film so convincingly models the attitudes and feel of a 19th-century man-of-war.I have not read the source material - the Maturin-Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brien - so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film to the books.  However, as director Peter Weir points out, the plots aren't nearly so important as the relationships between the boat and its crew, between the crew-members themselves, and the books' historical authority on the Age of Sail.  Thus, this doubly-named film (""Master and Commander"" and ""The Far Side of the World"" are, in fact, two different stories) concentrates on the accuracy of costumes, rigging, and speech.  This accuracy is essential, as immerses the viewer into the film, so when the action does take place, it is all the more poignant.  The basic plot - Capt. Aubrey hunting a larger and better armed French ship around the Cape - allows for some spectacular footage.  There are the obligatory sea battles and a visit to the Gallopagoes (filmed on location in the very islands), but the best part of the film is probably the storm as the ship rounds the Cape of Good Hope.  Combining location footage, computer animation, and model work (both full and 1/6 scale), the storm is hang-on-to-your armrests convincing.  This brings up the point of the effects; they are so seamless that they are unnoticeable, and this is possibly the film with the best-ever visual effects.So why only 4/5 stars?  Viewing this film on my system, it does move a little slow.  It works better in a movie theatre, I think, but since this is a review of the DVD, I have to deduct a star for the DVD-watching experience.  The extras on this two-disc set are interesting, but not complete.  There is ample footage of the film being made - including a 20-minute feature on the fantastic score and some deleted scenes - but there are no background featurettes on historical context, little on the anatomy/vocabulary of a square-rigged frigate, etc.  I think most people who would buy this DVD set would also be interested in this information, and not so much in information that is so similar to the extras on the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings special-edition DVD's.",4,An evocation of a time and place,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2723,"['oft-quoted', 'line', 'movie', 'ship', 'be', 'home', 'ship', 'England', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'had', 'tradition', '1805', 'year', 'film', 'ships', 'really', 'were', 'little', 'floating', 'islands', 'England', 'good', 'bad', 'made', 'formidible', 'opponents', 'was', 'morale-boosting', 'crew', 'etc', 'course', 'also', 'embodied', 'imperialistic', 'chauvenism', 'English', 'as', 'well', 'stratified', 'society', 'thoughts', 'went', 'head', 'watching', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'film', 'so', 'convincingly', 'models', 'attitudes', 'feel', '19th-century', 'man-of-war.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'Maturin-Aubrey', 'series', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'accuracy', 'film', 'books', 'However', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'points', 'out', 'plots', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'so', 'important', 'relationships', 'boat', 'crew', 'crew-members', 'books', 'historical', 'authority', 'Age', 'Sail', 'Thus', 'doubly-named', 'film', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'are', 'fact', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'accuracy', 'costumes', 'rigging', 'speech', 'accuracy', 'essential', 'immerses', 'viewer', 'film', 'so', 'when', 'action', 'take', 'place', 'more', 'poignant', 'basic', 'plot', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'hunting', 'larger', 'better', 'armed', 'French', 'ship', 'Cape', 'spectacular', 'footage', 'are', 'obligatory', 'sea', 'battles', 'visit', 'Gallopagoes', 'filmed', 'location', 'very', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'probably', 'storm', 'ship', 'Cape', 'Good', 'Hope', 'Combining', 'location', 'footage', 'computer', 'animation', 'model', 'work', 'full', '1/6', 'scale', 'storm', 'hang-on-to-your', 'armrests', 'convincing', 'up', 'point', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'seamless', 'are', 'unnoticeable', 'possibly', 'film', 'best-ever', 'visual', 'effects.So', 'why', 'only', '4/5', 'stars', 'Viewing', 'film', 'system', 'move', 'little', 'slow', 'better', 'movie', 'theatre', 'think', 'review', 'DVD', 'have', 'deduct', 'star', 'DVD-watching', 'experience', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'set', 'are', 'interesting', 'not', 'complete', 'ample', 'footage', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'including', '20-minute', 'feature', 'fantastic', 'score', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'background', 'historical', 'context', 'little', 'anatomy/vocabulary', 'square-rigged', 'frigate', 'etc', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'interested', 'information', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'so', 'similar', 'extras', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'special-edition', 'DVD']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747868,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00008W64E,Craig Matteson,"[7, 10]","It was wonderful watching a movie with well-drawn characters that have personalities and humanity with foibles, strengths, fears, and a sense of time and place in history.  I enjoyed the ""quiet"" scenes where we are able to get to know the men of the Surprise.  The friendship between Aubrey (Crowe) and Dr. Mautrin (Bettany) is a glue for the whole movie.  The state of their friendship is a barometer for the state of affairs for the mission of the ship.  Being a musician, I loved the scenes of them passing time making music (and the raucous music of the crew as well).Max Pirkus plays the 13-year-old Lord Blakeney with amazing skill.  His maturity reminds us of the time when children were not condescended to as creatures of little capacity and less responsibility as they are today.  Some may find such adult expectations of such a young person abhorrent, but given the life expectancy of the times to 13 was to be about a third of your lifespan.  They had to mature early and Lord Blakeney is a wonderful character with emotional strength, courage, and intellect beyond most adults.There are two major battle scenes and a storm scene off the southern tip of South America that provide the action scenes of the movie.  They are wonderfully done and are quite rousing.  The scenes of surgery on the ship are filmed in a way that is not visually grisly, but so emotionally intense that you will want to look away because of what you might see, but don't.I think it is always wonderful to capture a past time and place accurately.  While I am not a historian and I am sure that those historians who pay close attention to this period will find things to complain about, I did like the details they captured about the living conditions of a crew aboard such a confined space.  I don't know if all the details are right, but it was fun to watch a movie with details that added to the understanding of the plot rather than making one roll one's eyes at the implausibility of it all.A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends.",5,Big story full of interesting people and events,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,2120,"['was', 'wonderful', 'watching', 'movie', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'have', 'personalities', 'humanity', 'foibles', 'strengths', 'fears', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'history', 'enjoyed', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'Surprise', 'friendship', 'Aubrey', 'Crowe', 'Dr.', 'Mautrin', 'Bettany', 'glue', 'whole', 'movie', 'state', 'friendship', 'barometer', 'state', 'affairs', 'mission', 'ship', 'Being', 'musician', 'loved', 'scenes', 'passing', 'time', 'making', 'music', 'raucous', 'music', 'crew', 'as', 'well', '.Max', 'Pirkus', '13-year-old', 'Lord', 'Blakeney', 'amazing', 'skill', 'maturity', 'time', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'not', 'condescended', 'creatures', 'little', 'capacity', 'less', 'responsibility', 'are', 'today', 'may', 'find', 'such', 'adult', 'expectations', 'young', 'person', 'abhorrent', 'given', 'life', 'expectancy', 'times', '13', 'was', 'be', 'third', 'lifespan', 'had', 'mature', 'early', 'Lord', 'Blakeney', 'wonderful', 'character', 'emotional', 'strength', 'courage', 'intellect', 'most', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'battle', 'scenes', 'storm', 'scene', 'southern', 'tip', 'South', 'America', 'provide', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'are', 'quite', 'rousing', 'scenes', 'surgery', 'ship', 'are', 'filmed', 'way', 'not', 'visually', 'grisly', 'so', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'will', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'think', 'always', 'wonderful', 'capture', 'past', 'time', 'place', 'accurately', 'am', 'not', 'historian', 'am', 'sure', 'historians', 'who', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'period', 'will', 'find', 'things', 'complain', 'did', 'details', 'captured', 'living', 'conditions', 'crew', 'aboard', 'confined', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'details', 'are', 'right', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'details', 'added', 'understanding', 'plot', 'rather', 'making', 'one', 'roll', 'one', 'eyes', 'implausibility', 'great', 'adventure', 'bordering', 'epic', 'populated', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'few', 'would', 'treasure', 'friends']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Yes, Crowe is astonishing as usual and he has every bit of what it takes to COMMAND a role, and that he does here.  It wasn't until seeing it for the second time that I started to appreciate it more, you know, for what it was.  What it is is a great naval movie, not more or less about the battles and the death but about the life people led living on the ships, never seeing home.  The small sub plots which at first I felt took away from what I was waiting for actually served their purpose after watching it again.

Surprise the British ship seems an unsuitable match for their quarry. The enemy vessel has greater firepower and is seemingly impervious to cannons fired from Aubrey's battery. It becomes clear after the first engagement between the two that Aubrey  is going to have to rely on his wits to outwit his adversary.Down the coast of South America, around the vicious Cape Horn and north to the Galapagos Islands the Captain stays doggedly on the tail of the Archeron, narrowly missing his own destruction until the final heart pounding confrontation.Australian director Peter Weir holds no punches in his portrayal of life aboard an early nineteenth century warship and Russell Crowe along with his ""Beautiful Mind"" co-star Paul Bettany both give sterling performances as the Captain and his best friend Ships Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Simply put ""Master and Commander"" is a triumph of movie making and arguably one of the best movies to be put out by a major studio in recent years.Similarly the DVD holds no punches presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio in a fine transfer.

747878,AIO7DRHJAWJNO,B00008W64E,"Dave ""David""","[5, 5]","I think Jeff Shannon's review of the movie sums it up so nicely.  This is a must watch film for anyone who loves adventure and life on the high seas.  It is the most realistic film of life aboard an English Ship of the Line (warship) that I personnaly have ever seen.  Having served in the navy for many years as an officer on submarines, I know so well what life is like away from loved ones and so many months at sea with only the men around you and work.  We didn't have the ale or rum though, hehe.  Some of them you come to hate, others you call friends, and some you come to love as a brother, just like in the movie.  And as an officer you must always maintain discipline, as depicted in the movie, much to the dislike of even Captain Jack. I know some of you reading this may not like me saying that, but in the military, that is a matter of fact.  It always will be. Many men at that time were pressed into service and of course did not like that.  They were in general disruptive, unruely and insubordinate, so harsh things were done at times.  I don't approve of it, but that was the way it was.  And in fact, when we still had a draft in this country, situations were similar for some draftees.  Most performed their duty well and were a wonderful credit to their country, family and friends.  A few though were maybe not so much a credit, as like in the movie.  At that time though, and still today in many countries as ours, men and women will rise to the call of duty for their country and do it proudly, just like Captain Jack when he told his men to prepare for the final battle.I am sure the conditions were as depictited as in the movie because I think the author did allot of homework, and the sets for the movie were incredible.  I am a historian of sorts concerning the middle ages, but now I get a very good view of what life is like in the early nineteenth century from this movie, at least on the high seas. I have not read the books, but I think I will now, because as always, the books are so much more captivating and fullfilling in the pictures the author is trying to convey.If you like a swashbuckling tale which just puts you right there in the action, this movie is for you!

The brilliant plot is adapted from Patrick O'Brian's two novels written in the 1800's about war hero Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Crowe.  No other actor could have played him better.  He proves that he continually evolves as an actor through every film.  His tremendous talents are rare in modern-day entertainment.  Director Peter Weir leads the cast and crew to creating this masterpiece.  All of the realisms and hardtimes are greatly expressed in this film.  Such tremendous film quality offers audiences a great, unforgettable experience.  The action scenes are intense, keeping the battles raging and the ocean storms like a roller coaster.  Yet, the emotional aspect never dies.  During moments of peace and rest, the expressed struggles keep the emotional tides to the fullest, namely depression and fear.The elaborate background settings add the entertainment pleasure.  The Oscar winning sound editing and cinematography wonderfully add intensity to the action scenes and desplict the characters' surroundings fuller.  The costume design are accurate to the actual styles of 1805.  The visual effects greatly desplict the realities of the times.

That said, I enjoyed ""Master and Commander"" immensely.  I thought that director Peter Weir captured the claustrophobia of being aboard a warship circa 1800 and the feeling of being embattled at sea.  The construction of the ships, from every creaking plank and rusting nail, is flawless.  The sound and cinematography here is superb.  As far as the story, it's slow going at first but as the film progresses and the characters become more fleshed out it picks up momentum.  As far as the performances, what can you say about Russell Crowe, probably one of the most versatile actors working today.  He can add another memorable character in Jack Aubrey, the cocksure and determined captain of the H.M.S. Surprise.  He is equalled by Paul Bettany, the ship's surgeon and naturalist, Stephen Maturon.  These two are as much confidantes as adversaries.  Whereas Aubrey obsesses over attacking a state of the art French ship, the Acheron, Maturon lobbies Aubrey about taking a more cautious approach.  One could almost draw an obvious parallel in modern pop culture(dare I say it? Kirk and McCoy).

747887,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00008W64E,Deborah Earle,"[10, 13]","In "".L.A. Confidential"", Russell Crowe was the cop with  the dark and tragic past who found love in an unlikely place. In his Oscar-winning turn in ""Gladiator"" he showed us that man cannot live by bread and circuses alone. In ""A Beautiful Mind"", he takes the audience on a bizarre journey between genius and madness, and now, in this seafaring epic to which Peter Weir gives a surprisingly lighthanded direction, based on the novelsby Patrick O'Brian, Crowe lends his formidable stance to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey as he leads the crew of HMS Surprise in a campaign against the French ship Acheron in 1805.As the story commences, we view the British ship on the glistening waters off the coast of Brazil. The pre-dawn calm is shattered by the sound of the Acheron's cannonfire.Soon, the audience bears witness to the poignancy of lost innocence, graphic surgeries at sea, and the general claustrophobic conditions of a battleship in the early 19th century. A viewer can almost smell the stench, taste the awful food, and feel directly in the presence of both the lesser and greater of two weevils.The monotony is broken up with singing by the crew members, upperclassmen as well as underlings, and occassionally the elegant sound of Aubrey's violin as it mingles with the cello played by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (a role in which Crowe is reunited with  his 'Beautiful Mind' co-star, Paul Bettany)on a duet or two. As Aubrey's friend, the more analyticalMaturin provides a stablizing influence on the Captain.The camaraderie among the men deepens during Aubrey's dinnertime anecdotes, and outrageously bad puns as he loosens up a little while slightly inebriated.But the astute captain is firm and consistant in running his ship.  The film drives home the point that the young boys who served (personified by the angelic Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney) were not coddled because of their tender ages, and were made to grow up quickly in an era that had less respect for childhood.Viewers follow the crew through tragedies caused by natural or man-made disasters, and they also receive psychologicalprofiles of men who are forced to serve in such confining conditions.Aubrey often faces some wrenching dilemmas, but after many years at sea, never wavers in his certainty of whatever course of action he chooses. He spends a good bit of onscreen time  bestriding the deck with eyes that narrow and a perfect Cupid's bow mouth twisting into a scowl of determination during battle. A lot of the drama that cannot be expressed in words is expressed in close-ups  of Crowe's gracefully oval-shaped visage. When speaking in a jesting or slightly jesting manner, his large, deep-set  eyes-- which can never decide between emerald and opalescence--widen, and grow round as if he were daft.But he is mostly staid and stoic although we do see his delight in his work as he climbs up to and down from the highest heights of his ship to be rewarded with a more panoramic view of the ocean with upperclassman James D'Arcy at his side.Occassionally the men serving under him share his delight, and are relieved from months of confinement at sea when they weigh anchor in the Galapagos Islands where Dr. Maturin does his naturalist research and the crew play cricket as a respite from their duties. There is a sense of gentleness and serenity  brought on by the  beautiful Oscar winning-cinematography of the curious seals, tortoises, and other creatures as they receive a rare visit from humans. In a few brief moments the maimed Lord Blakeley has a chance to be a child as he roams about joyously in loose clothing as an assistant to the recently injured Maturin.Soon enough the pursuit of the Acheron is resumed. But the trip to the Galapagos results in Aubrey's gaining insight on how to lure and overtake the enemy ship. Strangely, the film's battle scenes didn't strike me as too intense, and while this film has its inevitably  dark and brooding moments, the lighter moments compliment and compensate for them quite nicely. There is a very stirring moment when Aubrey finally  views the corpse of his mortal enemy. Perhaps he feels some satisfaction...But how young and handsome his rival looks even in death. One wonders what his story was and how hard Aubrey had to try to suppress any feeling of common humanity as he accepted the French Captain's sword in surrender.Suppression of any such feelings may not have been too difficult when we see the high price of victory, laid out in sewn-up hammocks on the deck of the British ship...Men and boys of all ages in whom we've invested a few hour's time...The loss of sage advice of the elderly seamen, and the permanently halted ambition of the young men are dramatically emphasized as we view them lined up, pale and still, awaiting their final journey...But soon life aboard HMS Surprise resumes its normalcy, and when a piece of misinformation is revealed to Aubrey the merry pursuit of duty continues and as the crew go to quarters, we are left with a stringed duet to remember them by.",5,The Savage Grace of the Mariner's World,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,5048,"['.L.A', 'Confidential', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'cop', 'dark', 'tragic', 'past',

747890,A2BFNWTI57900U,B00008W64E,"D. E. Hill ""follower of the art of Natural Hi...","[1, 13]","I've really tried to like this movie.  In watching it on blu-ray after watching it on DVD, I can truly say that the blu-ray quality is really quite good, with a few poor shots from the original film intact, and the sound is great.  I have several major problems with the movie, all of which I think seriously detract from its quality.  First, the story line really drags on, and the relationship between the French and British combatants is not really developed to the extent that it deserves, as the movie focuses more on the personal relationship of the commander (R. Crowe) and the ship's doctor/naturalist.  There are a lot of minor side plots going on, like suicidal depression, and an inordinate number of surgeries.  The time scale of the pursuit around Cape Horn, like most events in this film, is lost on the viewer.  After a while, the consistently upbeat attitude of the commander is almost maniacal!  Then there is the ununatural but substantial natural history- an unusually large part of this film, as the ship's doctor is portrayed in a Darwinesque fashion, in the Galapagos.  The first strange episode involves the identification of meal worm (Tenebrionidae) larvae as ""weevils,"" part of a pun by the commander, but clearly demonstrating the ineptness of his naturalist friend.  This gets worse on the Galapagos, particularly where impossible telescopic views of remote animals are depicted, and the naturalist releases a captured lot of common green iguanas (Iguana iguana), a species that does not occur in the Galapagos Islands.  At least in Gladiator Ridley Scott (whose work I greatly respect) used a European Robin.  Imagine your reaction if he used an American Robin in a Roman battle scene!  Terrence Mallick, in The Thin Red Line, and in The New World, has also focused on natural history, but takes care to accurately depict the local flora and fauna (more than anyone).  Given the emphasis on Natural History in this film, and its obvious cost, care should definitely have been taken in this area.  It's either sloppy movie-making, or distain for natural history.",2,"Blu-ray quality good, movie has real problems",1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,2090,"[""'ve"", 'really', 'tried', 'like', 'movie', 'watching', 'blu-ray', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'few', 'poor', 'shots', 'original', 'film', 'intact', 'sound', 'great', 'have', 'several', 'major', 'problems', 'movie', 'think', 'seriously', 'detract', 'quality', 'First', 'story', 'line', 'really', 'relationship', 'French', 'British', 'combatants', 'not', 'really', 'developed', 'extent', 'movie', 'more', 'personal', 'relationship', 'commander', 'R.', 'Crowe', 'ship', 'doctor/naturalist', 'are', 'lot', 'minor', 'side', 'plots', 'going', 'suicidal', 'depression', 'inordinate', 'number', 'surgeries', 'time', 'scale', 'pursuit', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'most', 'events', 'film', 'lost', 'viewer', 'while', 'consistently', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'commander', 'almost', 'maniacal', 'Then', 'ununatural', 'substantial', 'natural', 'history-', 'unusually', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'ship', 'doctor', 'portrayed', 'Darwinesque', 'fashion', 'Galapagos', 'first', 'strange', 'episode', 'identification', 'meal', 'worm', 'Tenebrionidae', 'larvae', 'weevils', 'part', 'pun', 'commander', 'clearly', 'demonstrating', 'ineptness', 'naturalist', 'friend', 'worse', 'Galapagos', 'particularly', 'where', 'impossible', 'telescopic', 'views', 'remote', 'animals', 'are', 'depicted', 'naturalist', 'captured', 'lot', 'common', 'green', 'iguanas', 'Iguana', 'iguana', 'species', 'not', 'occur', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'least', 'Gladiator', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'work', 'greatly', 'respect', 'used', 'European', 'Robin', 'Imagine', 'reaction', 'used', 'American', 'Robin', 'Roman', 'battle', 'scene', 'Terrence', 'Mallick', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'New', 'World', 'also', 'focused', 'natural', 'history', 'care', 'accurately', 'depict', 'local', 'flora', 'fauna', 'more', 'anyone', 'Given', 'emphasis', 'Natural', 'History', 'film', 'obvious', 'cost', 'care', 'should', 'definitely', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'area', 'sloppy', 'movie-making', 'distain', 'natural', 'history']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747891,A3S7WU6DIH71CC,B00008W64E,Denny Vu Quach,"[8, 8]","Master and Commander is not just for Patrick O'Brian fans. Anyone who enjoys action and drama will enjoy this film. It ranges from great battle scenes with the tang of salt spray to human drama. The primary plot involves a cat and mouse game, set in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars, between Captain Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) ship Surprise and his enemy a French ship Acheron. (...)along for the ride we experience sailing, sea tactics, and life on board a ship of this era. The apprenticeship approach to schooling officers during the Napoleonic era placed children on board fighting vessels. We even see a brief glimpse of a lesson in navigation Captain Aubrey is giving the young midshipmen. Life in harm's way as the sea becomes a battlefield spares neither young nor old. The crowding, stale food, and mental toll that are a fact of life on vessels that are at sea for long periods of time are graphically portrayed. The mood is lightened by the exhilaration of the hunt and moments of courage, kindness, and Aubrey's penchant for terrible puns, which fans of O'Brian's books will recognize.Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), the side kick of this famous duo, provides a counterpoint to Aubrey's sense of duty. Through him we see medicine of the period grope its way toward the future. As an amateur naturalist, Dr. Maturin visits the Galapagos Islands much as Darwin would have during his famous trip on HMS Beagle 30 years after the 1805 date of the movie. In fact, Dr. Maturin's desire to visit the Islands becomes a source of conflict between himself and the single minded Aubrey. The resolution to the conflict is a measure of the friendship between Dr. Maturin and ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey.",5,The Battle Is On,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,1697,"['Master', 'Commander', 'not', 'just', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'fans', 'Anyone', 'who', 'action', 'drama', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'great', 'battle', 'scenes', 'tang', 'salt', 'spray', 'human', 'drama', 'primary', 'plot', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'set', '1805', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'ship', 'Surprise', 'enemy', 'French', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'ride', 'experience', 'sailing', 'sea', 'tactics', 'life', 'board', 'ship', 'era', 'apprenticeship', 'approach', 'schooling', 'officers', 'Napoleonic', 'era', 'placed', 'children', 'board', 'fighting', 'vessels', 'even', 'see', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'lesson', 'navigation', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'giving', 'young', 'midshipmen', 'Life', 'harm', 'way', 'sea', 'battlefield', 'young', 'old', 'crowding', 'stale', 'food', 'mental', 'toll', 'are', 'fact', 'life', 'vessels', 'are', 'sea', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'are', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'mood', 'lightened', 'exhilaration', 'hunt', 'moments', 'courage', 'kindness', 'Aubrey', 'penchant', 'terrible', 'puns', 'fans', ""O'Brian"", 'books', 'will', 'recognize.Dr', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'side', 'kick', 'famous', 'duo', 'counterpoint', 'Aubrey', 'sense', 'duty', 'see', 'medicine', 'period', 'grope', 'way', 'future', 'amateur', 'naturalist', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'much', 'Darwin', 'would', 'have', 'famous', 'trip', 'HMS', 'Beagle', '30', 'years', '1805', 'date', 'movie', 'fact', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'desire', 'visit', 'Islands', 'source', 'conflict', 'single', 'minded', 'Aubrey', 'resolution', 'conflict', 'measure', 'friendship', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

This is one of the best movies of the year and probably the best seafaring film in the last thirty (not counting submarine movies), but this DVD could take a cue or two from the franchise that totally beat it out last year The Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson knows how to treat his fans and he knows that giving us something besides the pathetic HBO first look documentary and only a FEW, albeit insightful, behind the scenes vignettes can go a long way to racking up DVD sales and creating a buzz around a film with the DVD release instead of it being some forgotten day in the middle of April (oh, did Master and Commander come out this week?  Maybe I'll pick that up sometime).Who else is tired of DVDs proclaiming deleted scenes as such a big bonus?  Either incorporate them back into the movie or get rid of them.  It seems all the studio or Peter Weir has to do is sweep up the cutting room floor and dump all of the garbage onto a disc and we'll buy it for a few dollars more (well I did, but you don't have to).No commentary either.  None.  LOTR has no less than four.  FOUR per movie.  This film, one of the greatest historical dramas and historically accurate portrayals of the napoleonic wars (not actual events, but methods) gives us no insight from the mind behind the movie (director and co-writer of a truly fantastic period script as far as period scripts go).  Peter Weir has to wake up.  I consider him to be among the few directors to have never had a misstep in his career (Fearless being the closest).  All he does is make perfect movies, but a little love for emerging technology couldn't hurt his fan base.  I would even have settled for a Collee or Crowe commentary.  Anything.To sum up.

Sadly, I have to say that this movie completely fell short on all fronts of what I was expecting.The movie is about the tale of Sailor Stephen Mataurin as he sails out to sea too see the wonders and strangeness of the richness of the lands on the 'far side' of the world while the Napeleonic Wars rage on in France.The good points which are rather sparse are good. The various shots of the oceans and the ships sailing are absolutely beautiful and spellbinding. The landscapes are also stunning as well. The various battle scenes are intense and bring out the graphic nature of what real life Pirate battles were really like and the sad results of war throughout the ages. The action scenes though only amount up to maybe ten or fifteen minutes of the movie. That's pretty much it for what's really enjoyable about this movie.The good points though are negated by the excessively slow pace of this movie. It drags and drags on that one can't help but feel tested at his or her ability to maintain interest in a slow movie for over two hours.

Right off the bat, the French ship surprises Aubrey and his men, causing them to flee the French ship.  The attack leads the crew to dub the Acheron 'The Phantom.'  We come to discover that the Acheron is a new type of vessel, constructed in a way that it is superior in design, speed, and firepower to the Surprise.The biggest surprise comes in the movies climax, as Aubrey and the crew of the Surprise engage the Acheron for the final time.  This is some of the finest naval warfare captured on film.  Few movies equal the cinematography of the clash between the two crews.  The only draw back to the scene is that it is often difficult to tell the two crews apart.  In addition, many of the characters have similar hair styles and costumes, so it is often confusing as to who was just stabbed, shot, or slew an enemy.After Russell Crowe, the character receiving the most attention is Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  Maturin is played by Paul Bettany.  Unlike the rest of the crew, Maturin's skills do not lie in combat or sailing, but in medicine and the natural sciences.  Much is made of his being a naturalist, and the lessons he gives to a young naval officer resound throughout the movie.  His character is a great foil for Aubrey as he is more conservative and thoughtful.'Master and Commander' is a very enjoyable film.  It falls just short of getting five stars because it borders on being just a bit too long.  In addition, portions of the film remind the observant viewer of 'Moby Dick' (substitute the Acheron for a whale) and 'Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner' (a large gull follows the ship and leads to some key scenes).  I haven't read the books, so I cannot discuss how the movie stacks up.  One last warning, there are some medical scenes after the first battle that the squemish would be best served by getting a friend to tell them whens it over.  I give this movie a good recommendation.",4,Surprise--In More Ways than One,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2352,"[""'Master"", 'Commander', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'Aubrey', 'received', 'orders', 'take', 'Surprise', 'crew', 'South', 'Atlantic', 'coast', 'South', 'America', 'pursue', 'Acheron', 'French', 'vessel', 'Acheron', 'captain', 'been', 'given', 'letter', 'marque', 'act', 'privateer', 'French', 'commandeering', 'British', 'ships', 'prizes.Aubrey', 'ship', 'not', 'only', ""'Surprise"", 'movie', 'Right', 'bat', 'French', 'ship', 'surprises', 'Aubrey', 'men', 'causing', 'flee', 'French', 'ship', 'attack', 'crew', 'dub', 'Acheron', ""'The"", 'Phantom', 'come', 'discover', 'Acheron', 'new', 'type', 'vessel', 'constructed', 'way', 'superior', 'design', 'speed', 'firepower', 'Surprise.The', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'movies', 'climax', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'Surprise', 'engage', 'Acheron', 'final', 'time', 'finest', 'naval', 'warfare', 'captured', 'film', 'Few', 'movies', 'equal', 'cinematography', 'clash', 'two', 'crews', 'only', 'draw', 'back', 'scene', 'often', 'difficult', 'tell', 'two', 'crews', 'apart', 'addition', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'similar', 'hair', 'styles', 'costumes', 'often', 'confusing', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'slew', 'enemy.After', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'receiving', 'most', 'attention', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Maturin', 'played', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'rest', 'crew', 'Maturin', 'skills', 'do', 'not', 'lie', 'combat', 'sailing', 'medicine', 'natural', 'sciences', 'Much', 'made', 'being', 'naturalist', 'lessons', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'resound', 'movie', 'character', 'great', 'foil', 'Aubrey', 'more', 'conservative', 'thoughtful', ""'Master"", 'Commander', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'just', 'short', 'getting', 'five', 'stars', 'being', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'addition', 'portions', 'film', 'remind', 'observant', 'viewer', ""'Moby"", 'Dick', 'substitute', 'Acheron', 'whale', ""'Rhyme"", 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'large', 'gull', 'ship', 'key', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'discuss', 'how', 'movie', 'up', 'One', 'last', 'warning', 'are', 'medical', 'scenes', 'first', 'battle', 'squemish', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'served', 'getting', 'friend', 'tell', 'give', 'movie', 'good', 'recommendation']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747897,AFITDZEWKJKAM,B00008W64E,D. Keating,"[1, 1]","Russell Crowe does a solid job as the British captain ordered to hunt down a French ship. His crew includes some interesting characters, but the main focus is on how the captain handles the multitude of situations he faces. For example, at one point the captain must decide between saving one of his crew vs. endangering the rest of them in the rescue attempt. Pretty heavy stuff. I rather enjoyed this leadership aspect of the film because it forces the viewer to think through ""what would I do in that situation"".One thing I did not like was the Darwin like sub-plot that involves the ship's doctor and his desire to explore the Galapogos islands. Some might find this interesting stuff, but I thought it was rather distracting and took away from the momentum during the second half of the film.I am a big fan of military history, but usually prefer ground combat to naval engagements. Having said that, Master and Commander is very entertaining, and gives what I consider to be an accurate portrayal of naval warfare in the early 1800s. Most of the sailor's time is spent in mundane tasks (like daily maintenance of the vessel), with occasions of great excitement during combat engagements. The director does a great job with the fighting scenes. He captures the chaos involved that leaders faced, and the courage required of the crew to gain victory.I recommend this film to anyone interested in how naval combat was fought during this time period. If you are a Russell Crowe fan, you will also enjoy it, although it is not his best.",4,Entertaining tale about Men at war on the sea,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,1537,"['Russell', 'Crowe', 'solid', 'job', 'British', 'captain', 'ordered', 'hunt', 'down', 'French', 'ship', 'crew', 'interesting', 'characters', 'main', 'focus', 'how', 'captain', 'multitude', 'situations', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'captain', 'must', 'decide', 'saving', 'one', 'crew', 'vs.', 'endangering', 'rest', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'Pretty', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'leadership', 'aspect', 'film', 'viewer', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', '.One', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'Darwin', 'sub-plot', 'ship', 'doctor', 'desire', 'explore', 'Galapogos', 'islands', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'distracting', 'took', 'away', 'momentum', 'second', 'half', 'film.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'military', 'history', 'usually', 'prefer', 'ground', 'combat', 'naval', 'engagements', 'Having', 'said', 'Master', 'Commander', 'very', 'entertaining', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'naval', 'warfare', 'early', '1800s', 'Most', 'sailor', 'time', 'spent', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'daily', 'maintenance', 'vessel', 'occasions', 'great', 'excitement', 'combat', 'engagements', 'director', 'great', 'job', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'chaos', 'involved', 'leaders', 'faced', 'courage', 'required', 'crew', 'gain', 'victory.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'how', 'naval', 'combat', 'was', 'fought', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'fan', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'not', 'best']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747898,A3CEPFGG336O73,B00008W64E,DL,"[0, 0]","First off, this is perhaps one of the best movies of 2003 if not the last decade. It's difficult to imagine why it received a luke-warm reception at the box office, but then again so many great movies often don't do as well as they should. Russel Crowe's other notable period piece, Gladiator, achieved phenomenal success with a fraction of the historical detail and depth of dialogue that this film has to offer. I can't think of another film that does this great of a job paying tribute to English naval commanders of that era.While I'm not intimately familiar with British naval history, I get the impression from this film that the warship commanders of the day were cunning tacticians, charismatic leaders, and fearless explorers in their own right. If that is true, then I believe that their story needs to be told in a theatrical format that is both visually stunning and intellectually captivating. This film did just that. Prior to watching this, my last recollection of a memorable film set in this context was ""The Bounty"" with Anthony Hopkins and Liam Neeson. It was a terrific film, but had more of a documentary-themed storyline as opposed to action-oriented fiction.One of the more interesting aspects is the unique chemistry that plays out between the lead characters Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, and Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany. Capt. Aubrey is the ship's commander, an officer of the British Royal Navy. Dr. Maturin has the official duty of being the ship's surgeon, but has a broader, more informal role as a naturalist / scientist. Throughout the film, we see occasional glimpses into their personalities as they interact with one another. They have very distinct, contrasting perspectives that at times can be a source of conflict between them. Aubrey, being the ship's commander, has the final say in all matters, but his rank does not preclude his respect and consideration for his good friend and occasional advisor, Dr. Maturin.To put it plainly, their character development is a twist on the relationship between Star Trek's Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. As is obvious, Kirk is the Star Trek counterpart to Aubrey. The starship Enterprise's science officer, Spock, is a role similar to that of scientist/naturalist Dr. Maturin. However, the similarities end there. The persona portrayed by Bettany as Dr. Maturin contradicts the boring, unfeeling, calculating scientist stereotype -- a stereotype perpetuated by the almost satirically ""logical"" Mr. Spock. The scientific nature of Mr. Spock is in fact presented as a flaw of character that limits his ""human-ness"" to the point of his being socially inept.What we see from Dr. Maturin is a psychological 180. Not only is he human, but he is what some would call a ""humanist."" He is opposed to disciplinary floggings, taking the side of the offending sailor in one scene. He makes allusions to his disdain for tyrannical establishments, accusing Aubrey of ""abusing power"" at one point. He is both compassionate and conscientious. Not only does he mentor the midshipman Mr. Blakely in the ways of science, but while exploring the Galapagos he has the sense of mind to release his coveted live specimens instead of leaving them needlessly imprisoned in cages. His passion for observing nature stems from his appreciation for nature itself, not just from a desire to achieve fame through new discoveries. He provides Aubrey with powerful insight into the intricacies of human nature. This happens when Aubrey expresses his befuddlement over the zealousness of the enemy captain, to which Maturin replies, ""He fights like you, Jack.""His ability to tune out the daily militarized routine of the HMS Surprise by reinventing himself as a naturalist is an attribute that indirectly expands the breadth of their mission. But, as Aubrey put it, ""We do not have time for your damned hobbies, sir!"" It's clear that Maturin's approach to leadership is not befitting an officer in his majesty's navy -- nor is he one. In fact his interpretaton of serving king and country runs counter to that creed on a fundamental level, and that is one more reason why he is an antithesis of the Mr. Spock stereotype.",5,Intriguing Capt.

Case in point:  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, Peter Weir's epic depiction of life at sea in the early 19th Century.  Here we find gritty authenticity where absolutely nothing is spared, from the suffocating stench of below decks, to the mirth and mayhem of the ship's officers dining together, to the brutality of hand-to-hand combat as one ship overtakes another.  It's all as believable as it is spellbinding, as we follow HMS 'Surprise' as it plays a cat-and-mouse game across two oceans with a vastly superior French frigate.Russell Crowe is the headliner playing Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a most approachable commander with a winning disposition paired with astonishing resolution; Captain Aubrey is going to take the French ship, dire consequences or no.  This often puts him at odds with the ship's surgeon and Jack's personal friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany); Maturin serves as a sort of barometer for the crew, and is allowed to be upfront and frank with the captain.  These exchanges create remarkable tension, as both men have unwavering mutual respect.  Meanwhile we're privy to the ongoing adventures of the 'Surprise' as it sails the Atlantic, rounds the Cape of South America, and heads into the immense waters of the Pacific; from battle to meatball surgery to topsails to camaraderie to rigid discipline to the sailors' infatuation with superstition.  The cast playing the crew is stellar, including Billy Boyd (who will always be known to me as Pippin).

Maybe not a movie you will see 3-4 times, but, certainly a movie you will see twice..... once at the theatre (highly recommended) and once (1 time) again when the DVD comes out (for the Directors' Commentary - my plan anyhow).Good script writing, great cinematography, great acting, great sets, great props and costumes, wonderful music.The realism of the sets including the ships, the ocean cinematography, and the cat & mouse naval conflict makes this a big screen must see.  The ship is a real replica 1800s-era British tall ship (Rose - from Rhode Island).  The big screen viewer is truly transported to another time.Unfortunately, the action and dialog doesn't make you crave watching and dissecting the film a half dozen times like other big screen action films.

A highly demanding lot they are, accustomed to the best writing this side of Earth. Yes, I know, and the four stars average (after 480 reviews) does not really surprise me...I read ALL 21 of Patrick O'Brian's novels about Captain Aubrey & Dr. Stephen Maturin before watching this. Not to get prepared for the movie (ha, the very thought...), but because a friend keyed me on to the fact that Patrick O'Brian > Ayn Rand, Gore Vidal, James Joyce, et al. Despite (or rather, his worth is further confirmed by) not being taught in college.Read his novels. If not, you really are cheating yourself of the best historical literature available today. Yes, we are talking over two thousand pages. Yes, it is that good.As for this movie, bear in mind a film maker has to compress a lot of action into two hours. That means lots of meaning, detail and humor gets cut, sadly. Which is why I am saying: read the books. But, if you have read the books, your mind can supply the missing details, and you will enjoy the familiar characters brought to life on film. I have always liked Crowe and think he does a competent job, though I definitely pictured Aubrey differently (bigger and blonde, for one). What I really applaud is the fine ship they've made and the battle action. I am pleased that movies are being made about quality novels, finally.Yes, there could have been many improvements; I am reminded of the difficulty in bringing ""The Lord of the Rings"" to film.

We see and feel a lot here and this film is in no hurry to rush to the climax as one is very likely to be hooked after the first scene.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:'MASTER AND COMMANDER: The Far Side of the World', Directed by Peter Weir is a film based on two novels of the same names, set in the Napoleanic War by author Patrick O'Brian. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.--* THE MAJOR PLAYERS *--Russell Crowe - Captain Jack AubreyPaul Bettany - Dr. Stephen MaturinBilly Boyd - Barrett BondenJames D'Arcy - 1st Lt.

Thurlow,"[4, 4]","""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship ""Acheron"".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.This movie is highly recommended as a thrilling drama and as a glimpse into the British Royal Navy at what was arguably its peak as the best navy in the world.",4,Lucky Jack Aubrey Comes to Life,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,1541,"['Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'dramatization', 'characters', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'Naval', 'novels.Set', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'storyline', 'built', 'pursuit', 'British', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'Captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'ship', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'French', 'warship', 'Acheron', 'pursuit', 'encounter', 'South', 'Atlantic', 'smaller', 'Surprise', 'off', 'second', 'best', 'Aubrey', 'repair', 'ship', 'sea', 'pursue', 'Acheron', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'South', 'Pacific', 'ship', 'crew', 'will', 'enjoy', 'brief', 'visit', 'stunning', 'Galapagos', 'returning', 'hunt', 'climax', 'movie', 'second', 'confrontation', 'Surprise', 'Acheron.Russell', 'Crowe', 'pitch-perfect', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'firm', 'fair', 'master', 'commander', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'equally', 'perfect', 'ship', 'doctor', 'commander', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'mitigate', 'effects', 'crew', 'Aubrey', 'obcessive', 'pursuit', 'Acheron', 'halfway', 'world.The', 'movie', 'rich', 'period', 'detail', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'life', 'British', 'warship', 'crewed', 'tough', 'sailors', 'officered', 'interesting', 'collection', 'sometimes', 'desperately', 'young', 'officers', 'sequences', 'sea', 'rounding', 'Horn', 'horrendous', 'weather', 'boarding', 'enemy', 'vessel', 'are', 'thrilling', 'well-executed.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'thrilling', 'drama', 'glimpse', 'British', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'what', 'was', 'arguably', 'peak', 'best', 'navy', 'world']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

747911,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00008W64E,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[6, 7]","Russell Crowe is magnificent as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey, captain of the HMS Surprise.  Aubrey and his crew are hoping to intercept and destroy Acheron, a powerful and speedy French warship. The year is 1805, and the French are at war with the British. Capturing Acheron would give the British a much-needed naval victory against Napoleon. However, Aubrey and his crew soon discover that Acheron's captain is an extremely clever tactician and a formidable opponent.  After a crippling battle, Aubrey must decide whether to lick his wounds and head for home or continue his pursuit of Acheron.Peter Weir gets high praise for his meticulous direction of &quot;Master of Commander.&quot;  The movie looks authentic down to the smallest detail.  Weir shows us how crewmen behaved while living for months on board a warship.  Scenes of tempestuous storms, raging battles, wounded men screaming in agony, and young boys trying to act as courageous as their adult heroes are unforgettable.  The cinematography by Russell Boyd and Sandy Sissell is breathtaking.Russell Crowe completely inhabits the body and soul of Jack Aubrey, who at times acts like a man possessed.  His pride and strong sense of duty sometimes blind him to reality.  Yet, Aubrey is also a man of principle, compassion, and deep feeling, who cares very much about the men under his command. Paul Bettany is Crowe's counterpart as the intellectual, sensitive, and outspoken Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's talented surgeon and a gifted naturalist. On quiet evenings, Stephen plays classical music with his old friend, Captain Aubrey, but the two men eventually clash over Aubrey's obsession with completing his mission successfully.Although &quot;Master and Commander&quot; takes place in the nineteenth century, its themes are relevant to the times in which we live. Weir raises very interesting questions about the nature of patriotism and leadership.  Crowe, in a gritty and sharply delineated performance, demonstrates the agony of making decisions that will inevitably lead to a loss of life.&quot;Master and Commander&quot; is a swashbuckling movie that one rarely sees these days, and it is also a thoughtful look at courage, determination, love of country, and humanity.  It is a wonderful movie that is one of the best of 2003.",5,&quot;This ship is England.&quot;,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,2302,"['Russell', 'Crowe', 'magnificent', 'quot', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'quot', 'Aubrey', 'captain', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'are', 'hoping', 'intercept', 'destroy', 'Acheron', 'powerful', 'speedy', 'French', 'warship', 'year', '1805', 'French', 'are', 'war', 'British', 'Capturing', 'Acheron', 'would', 'give', 'British', 'much-needed', 'naval', 'victory', 'Napoleon', 'However', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'soon', 'discover', 'Acheron', 'captain', 'extremely', 'clever', 'tactician', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'crippling', 'battle', 'Aubrey', 'must', 'decide', 'lick', 'wounds', 'head', 'home', 'continue', 'pursuit', 'Acheron.Peter', 'Weir', 'high', 'praise', 'meticulous', 'direction', 'quot', 'Master', 'Commander.', 'quot', 'movie', 'authentic', 'down', 'smallest', 'detail', 'Weir', 'how', 'crewmen', 'behaved', 'living', 'months', 'board', 'warship', 'Scenes', 'tempestuous', 'storms', 'raging', 'battles', 'wounded', 'men', 'screaming', 'agony', 'young', 'boys', 'trying', 'act', 'as', 'courageous', 'adult', 'heroes', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'cinematography', 'Russell', 'Boyd', 'Sandy', 'Sissell', 'breathtaking.Russell', 'Crowe', 'completely', 'body', 'soul', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'who', 'times', 'acts', 'man', 'possessed', 'pride', 'strong', 'sense', 'duty', 'sometimes', 'blind', 'reality', 'Aubrey', 'also', 'man', 'principle', 'compassion', 'deep', 'feeling', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'men', 'command', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Crowe', 'counterpart', 'intellectual', 'sensitive', 'outspoken', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'ship', 'talented', 'surgeon', 'gifted', 'naturalist', 'quiet', 'evenings', 'Stephen', 'classical', 'music', 'old', 'friend', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'two', 'men', 'eventually', 'clash', 'Aubrey', 'obsession', 'completing', 'mission', 'successfully.Although', 'quot', 'Master', 'Commander', 'quot', 'place', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'themes', 'are', 'relevant', 'times', 'live', 'Weir', 'very', 'interesting', 'questions', 'nature', 'patriotism', 'leadership', 'Crowe', 'gritty', 'sharply', 'delineated', 'performance', 'agony', 'making', 'decisions', 'will', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'loss', 'life.', 'quot', 'Master', 'Commander', 'quot', 'swashbuckling', 'movie', 'one', 'rarely', 'days', 'also', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'courage', 'determination', 'love', 'country', 'humanity', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'best', '2003']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

I thought would like this movie because:a)It got so many good reviews and usually that is a sign that it is a good movie.b)Russell Crowe usually picks good movies(Remember ""A Beautiful Mind.""I really enjoyed how this movie made you feel that you were actually on a boat. The preformanceswere also great. Russell Crowe could be nominated for an Oscar. The problem with this movie was that it was a little dull. The movie is about two and a half hours, and I felt that some of the scenes could have been deleted from the movie. I felt the same way and I stated that in my review for ""Cold Mountain."" I also gave that three stars for the exact same reasons. Both of these movies wee good but had scenes that were useless. I also didn't feel that the plot for this movie came early enough. The storyline started pretty late in the movie. This movie also ends it as if there is defintly going to be a sequal. They probally will because it made alot of money already, and because it is based on a seris of books. There is more to the story then this.The story is about Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany as Captain Jack and Dr. Stephan Maturin. It takes places in April of 1805 and the only thing that stands between Napoleon and the world is the British Army. Jack is ordered to take his warship and intercept the French. But the French have caught up to Jack's boat and after a brutal attack, Jack's boat escapes into the fogbank. Jack's choice to fix the boat at sea instead of going to a port does not feel right to his right hand man, friend, and doctor to the boat Stephan Maturin. As Jack continues to follow the French boat, they try to avoid more attacks, and they push the crew and the young men on the boat to their limits. But Jack becomes determined to catch the French to the point where Maturin begins to question his professional choices, and if they are the right ones or not.I wrote a review for ""Master and Commander,"" when I first saw it a few months ago but it didn't make it to amazon. So I decided to rewrite it and try to explain more what could have made the film worked. Like I said above, the movie made you feel that you were really on a ship. But some of the scenes also were not needed. Take the scene where Maturin gets shot, and preforms the operation on himself. I liked that scene, but it didn't fit in to the story. It was a good movie, but I was very hopeful that it would be a great movie. Mixed reviews for this one. Should have waited for the video.

While the part of Stephen Maturin is sadly miscast (and he never gets to show off his role as a secret agent extraordinaire), Russell Crowe makes a surprisingly believable and effective Jack Aubrey.  However, this may have been a mistake as well, since the Jack Aubrey series by Patrick O'brian spans 21 novels, and Russell Crowe is nothing if not an expensive actor, I wonder if the movie people can ever afford to do any sort of a sequel of what is admittedly, a genre of limited appeal.

Croson,"[3, 3]","Although other reviewers have pointed out that the film is based on Patrick O'Brian's ""canon"" of 20 books which constitute, in their entirety, a 7,000 page novel, complaints that 'Master and Commander' doesn't tell the story of any one of the books are misplaced, in my opinion. In fact, the film cherry-picks the highlights of certain themes that run through most of the 20 novels, and does it very well. The personality conflicts that give life and substance to the friendship of the two principal characters -Captain Jack Aubrey and physician/naturalist Stephen Maturin, are revealed, but not overdone. The depiction of the early 19th century British Navy as a square-fisted, hard-drinking band of brothers brought together by shared hardship and mortal danger is vividly displayed in a way not often found in cinematic nautical adventure stories.Perhaps this is a narrow viewpoint, but in my opinion the visual effects of HMS Surprise seal this film as one of the greats in its genre. This is not a model in a millpond, but a genuine working square-rigged ship: the Rose, renamed Surprise for the film. The scenic shots of the ship under way are breathtaking. So often in sailing films we see sails flapping in the breeze so as to make it seem ""real"" in Hollywood's misguided opinion. In 'Master and Commander' every sail is drawing, luffs quivering, lines taut... in other words, it seems real because it is real. The depiction of the almost unimaginably crowded and Spartan conditions, taken as quite normal by the men of those times, are wonderfully brought to life.The music is delightful, based as it is on a significant element of the story. Aubrey and Maturin are in fact fairly accomplished musicians on the violin and cello respectively, and that shared delight is a strong part of the glue that holds them together. Use of period music (Bach, Corelli) for violin and cello as background for well chosen scenes is inspired. The ship and the music flow together, giving both a visual and aural sense of the times.Crowe was an excellent choice for the Aubrey character. He seems to understand that while Aubrey isn't given to excessive displays of emotion (except laughing while drunk at table, or in the midst of battle), he is not immune to them. Crowe resists the temptation to overplay Aubrey's subdued emotional reactions in order to ""give them life"", and instead gives us the man imagined by the novelist: naturally inclined to a jovial nature, extroverted, often kind, but quite steely when it came to his ship and his duty. Crowe captures the man splendidly.The Maturin character is sometimes cited as miscast, but in my view the only miscasting lies in his appearance; the Maturin of the novels is frequently described as ""ill-looking"". Given the Hollywood obsession with good looks, it must be hard to cast for ""ugly"" and still get excellent acting skills, the field being so limited. And having Maturin reasonably good looking doesn't really detract from the story, except for the purist. He is otherwise true to character in the film.It would be easy for a devoted follower (of which I am one) of Patrick O'Brian's canon to concentrate on the mixed plot inconsistencies and thus mutter through the movie.

Even with it's clear advantages, the French frigate avoids battle whenever circumstances favor the British, instead catching the HMS Surprise off guard several times in situations even more favorable to the French. The British are able to repeatedly escape, but a final, climactic, battle is inevitable.

Master and Commander is the story of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his men of the HMS Surprise in 1805, during the British-French war. His ship is searching for the French Acheron, a larger, more-heavily gunned warship. In a terrific scene at night in fog, a young midshipman senses something ahead, but isn't certain enough to sound an alarm. Suddenly, the French ship is upon them and all hell breaks loose. It is a true picture of combat, whether in 1805 or in Iraq today. These kinds of scenes of daily life and terrible fighting give a reality to this film - a reality that overwhelms you with its attention to detail. Russell Crowe does a splendid performance as Captain Aubrey - capable, dedicated, yet caring for his men. The film has bloody scenes, but not as bad as ER scenes on TV.

747935,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00008W64E,Get What We Give,"[2, 3]","Master and Commander...is the visceral visual embodiment of what naval war films and stories have always strived to achieve but have never been able to do:  capture the realities of 19th century naval life and warfare.  Based on a series of novels, Master and Commander is an amalgamation of several of the novels I am told.  It is my hope that we will see more films of a similar nature in the future.I don't know who made this film - was it the Brits, the Aussies, or the Americans, but whoever did so, paid attention to detail (or kept to the source material's detail)? The great attention to detail leads me to believe it could not have been an American made film (we're notorious for throwing any reality out the window for the sake of a climactic scene or explosion).  What do I mean?Watch any film old Hollywood or British film that covers 19th century seafaring subject matter (Billy Budd, Captain Blood, Mutiny on the Bounty, etc.) and you'll notice quickly that there are a large number of ""older"" actors present as the mates on the ships.  Now take a look at Master and Commander... You'll notice that there are fewer than 10% of the crew who are over the age of 30.  The fact of the matter was that people, in general, just didn't live terribly long at the time.  Throw in military service at sea and you can reduce the age limit even more.Take a look at the midshipmen...""Ridiculous!"", you say.  They're portrayed as mere boys.  That's exactly what they were.  Boys were educated at home in the basics and then sent off to apprentice under a master in whatever trade they were expected to learn, be it blacksmiths, carpenters, accounts, etc.  In the case of the young boys in this movie, they are the 19th century equivalent of ""interns"" of ""management trainees"" to the officers in charge of the ship.  Midshipmen  came from well-to-do, or upper class, families of military heritage.  The boys of such officers were expected to take up the trade.  Lower classes could not hope to become officers in the military.  I have never before seen this accurately portrayed on film before.The film is not too unlike Moby Dick in its singular, relentless plot:  Russell Crowe, as a British captain, is charged with finding the French frigate Acheron off the coast of Brazil.  He is to stop or destroy the ship.  The movie revolves around this singular plot.  You see, Crowe's ship is much smaller, less well equipped, slower, and more vulnerable than the French ship.This is probably not a woman's movie.  There is no love interest in this film unless you think of the men pining for their wives or girlfriends who do not appear on screen.  Then there are the brief glimpses of native girls at one of the Brazilian islands where the ship gathers supplies.That's it.  There's no hanky panky.  There's no sex.  There's no nudity.  In fact, I could only count one curse word, and that was only because I was watching the movie with subtitles on part of the time to understand some of the quick cockney dialogue.  Now, violence, there's plenty of it.  There's blood, but really there's no guts.  It's all blood of the the red Karo syrup variety and none of the oozing or spewing wound variety.  There are no great special effects awards to be won for best dismemberments or amputations or decapitations.  Frankly, it's a visceral movie, but nothing like most of the films out there.Yes, the dialogue is machine gun fast and said with an ear for accuracy.  This means that unless you really understand the dialogue you're going to be lost.  Now, I watch the Britcoms all the time and I was lost.  That's why I turned on the subtitles.  It helped tremendously.The film is very emotional and nerve racking.  Frankly, I was actually a bit disappointed with the ending.  I half expected it to continue.  It seems to set itself up for a sequel. Or not.  I just don't know.  It could be that I'm just expectant of a sequel in a society that automatically provides one when a film doesn't tie up every little loose end nice and tightly.I highly recommend this film.",5,This is what all naval battle films have strived to be,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,4056,"['Master', 'Commander', 'visceral', 'visual', 'embodiment', 'what', 'naval', 'war', 'films', 'stories', 'have', 'always', 'strived', 'achieve', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'capture', 'realities', '19th', 'century', 'naval', 'life', 'warfare', 'Based', 'series', 'novels', 'Master', 'Commander', 'amalgamation', 'several', 'novels', 'am', 'told', 'hope', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'similar', 'nature', 'future.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'Brits', 'Aussies', 'Americans', 'whoever', 'did', 'so', 'paid', 'attention', 'detail', 'kept', 'source', 'material', 'detail', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'leads', 'believe', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'American', 'made', 'film', ""'re"", 'notorious', 'throwing', 'reality', 'window', 'sake', 'climactic', 'scene', 'explosion', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'Watch', 'film', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'British', 'film', '19th', 'century', 'seafaring', 'subject', 'matter', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'Captain', 'Blood', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'quickly', 'are', 'large', 'number', 'older', 'actors', 'present', 'mates', 'ships', 'Now', 'take', 'look', 'Master', 'Commander', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'are', 'fewer', '10', '%', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'age', '30', 'fact', 'matter', 'was', 'people', 'general', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'terribly', 'long', 'time', 'Throw', 'military', 'service', 'sea', 'can', 'reduce', 'age', 'limit', 'even', 'more.Take', 'look', 'midshipmen', 'Ridiculous', 'say', ""'re"", 'portrayed', 'mere', 'boys', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'Boys', 'were', 'educated', 'home', 'basics', 'then', 'sent', 'off', 'apprentice', 'master', 'trade', 'were', 'expected', 'learn', 'be', 'blacksmiths', 'carpenters', 'accounts', 'etc', 'case', 'young', 'boys', 'movie', 'are', '19th', 'century', 'equivalent', 'interns', 'management', 'trainees', 'officers', 'charge', 'ship', 'Midshipmen', 'came', 'well-to-do', 'upper', 'class', 'families', 'military', 'heritage', 'boys', 'such', 'officers', 'were', 'expected', 'take', 'up', 'trade', 'Lower', 'classes', 'could', 'not', 'hope', 'become', 'officers', 'military', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'film', 'before.The', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'singular', 'relentless', 'plot', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'British', 'captain', 'charged', 'finding', 'French', 'frigate', 'Acheron', 'coast', 'Brazil', 'stop', 'destroy', 'ship', 'movie', 'singular', 'plot', 'see', 'Crowe', 'ship', 'much', 'smaller', 'less', 'well', 'equipped', 'slower', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'French', 'ship.This', 'probably', 'not', 'woman', 'movie', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'think', 'men', 'pining', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'screen', 'Then', 'are', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'native', 'girls', 'one', 'Brazilian', 'islands', 'where', 'ship', 'supplies.That', 'hanky', 'panky', 'sex', 'nudity', 'fact', 'could', 'only', 'count', 'one', 'curse', 'word', 'was', 'only', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'part', 'time', 'understand', 'quick', 'cockney', 'dialogue', 'Now', 'violence', 'plenty', 'blood', 'really', 'guts', 'blood', 'red', 'Karo', 'syrup', 'variety', 'none', 'oozing', 'spewing', 'wound', 'variety', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'awards', 'be', 'won', 'best', 'dismemberments', 'amputations', 'decapitations', 'Frankly', 'visceral', 'movie', 'nothing', 'most', 'films', 'out', 'there.Yes', 'dialogue', 'machine', 'gun', 'fast', 'said', 'ear', 'accuracy', 'really', 'understand', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'Now', 'watch', 'Britcoms', 'time', 'was', 'lost', 'why', 'turned', 'subtitles', 'helped', 'tremendously.The', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'nerve', 'racking', 'Frankly', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'half', 'expected', 'continue', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'not', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'be', ""'m"", 'just', 'expectant', 'sequel', 'society', 'automatically', 'one', 'when', 'film', ""n't"", 'tie', 'up', 'little', 'loose', 'end', 'nice', 'tightly.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

747938,A21XVS00AIENLX,B00008W64E,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[2, 3]","Director Peter Weir delved deeply into the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew as they embark on a cat and mouse game to capture or destroy the highly advanced French enemy frigate, Acheron. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Capt Jack Aubrey was finely tuned to create a brilliant tactician with wit, humor and intense leadership qualities with much humanity.  He was able to laugh with his men yet instill the highest standards of discipline and expected protocol to be followed to the tee.  The ship's doctor, a naturist and healer, does not understand the military mindset and understands even less the fine line between friendship and duty.  It's through their banter we come to understand the leadership-style and character of Capt Jack Aubrey.The great plus of this movie resides in the extensive detail that is put into recreating a late 17th century era from both a Naval and Darwinian viewpoint.  Orders, protocol, uniforms, salutes, meals, canons and even choice language is very well depicted in this movie.  The actors make it seem as if their whole lives had been on that ship.  You really felt like you were part of that crew. Equally realistic is the doctor's fascination with the creatures of the Galapagos Islands, calling the animals by their scientific name and keeping a detailed diary of drawings.The director definitely wanted to highlight the emerging presence of modern science and how it could be challenging to centuries of tradition and values.  This is clearly paralleled in the doctor's and Capt Aubrey's distinct philosophies. But Weir is clever enough to resolve this by showing the two can co-exist and prove quite a powerful, if not necessary, combination.If you're expecting a movie with a lot of barking orders, swashbuckling and canon-fire in scene after scene, just all out action, then you could be mistaking this for Pirates of the Carribean or even Gladiator. This is very much a serious drama with engaging action sequences built into it, not the other way around. So it can be slightly off-putting, if not a bit boring.Nonetheless a worthwhile and insightful film.

747939,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00008W64E,Glen Engel Cox,"[6, 6]","I was wary of this movie from the previews, as it seemed like it had focused on only one part of the wonderful Patrick O'Brian books--the character of ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey--and used that as a vehicle for Russell Crowe. No other actor got ""named"" in the preview, for one, and the whole focus of the preview seemed to be on Crowe looking pensive or decisive or jumping into action. But the preview isn't the movie, and even though all those things are in the movie, there's a whole lot more.I really shouldn't have worried, as the director and co-screenwriter is Peter Weir, whose films I have enjoyed in the past (most recently, The Truman Show, another ""vehicle"" for a star at the top of the heap of the moment). And, having read some of the source material, I knew that there was depth to these characters. My interest in the books had as much to do with the interplay between the patriotic, stuffed-shirt Aubrey and the subversive, idealistic Maturin as it did with the minutia of who had the weather gauge and the day-to-day life for nearly 200 men aboard a floating bunch of wood.The film captures both quite well, although Crowe's Aubrey doesn't come across quite as proud and full-of-himself as he does in the books (in fact, the movie hardly shows a chink in his armor). But it shows his character's cleverness and resourcefullness, just as it shows the doctor's inquistiveness and sea naiveity. It also emphasizes on the roughness of the life, showing the bilge, the carpentry, the lash, the need for rum and provisions, and the constant practicing with the guns. But, best of all, while Crowe's character is important, for most of the plot, he is ancilliary as we follow aspects of the rest of the crew: the midshipman whom the others see as a ""Jonah,"" the young lord who loses his arm in the first battle, and the doctor himself, wounded at a critical juncture. I hesitate to say more about the plot, as that might detract from someone's enjoyment of the story, and for an action movie, it truly is the story that makes this one shine.The soundtrack is perfect, with the wood constantly creaking and groaning, and I'm thankful that no one has ever perfect smell-o-vision, because the visuals were enough of a suggestion in that direction.There's twenty books in the O'Brian series, and I'm sure that some studio head is slavering at the box office receipts and thinking sequel. If so, I hope that the next will feature a director as good as Weir and bring in some of the romantic subplot with Sophie or the undercover exploits of Maturin. This movie has established the main characters, just as the first book did, and if a sequel is to be any good, it has to do just as O'Brian did and be more than ""Hornblower, Too"" but a fascinating look into a very alien world, so unlike our own today.",4,Captures the spirit of the life aboard a navy vessel,1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,2799,"['was', 'wary', 'movie', 'previews', 'seemed', 'had', 'focused', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'wonderful', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'books', 'character', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'used', 'vehicle', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'other', 'actor', 'got', 'named', 'preview', 'one', 'whole', 'focus', 'preview', 'seemed', 'be', 'Crowe', 'looking', 'pensive', 'decisive', 'jumping', 'action', 'preview', ""n't"", 'movie', 'even', 'things', 'are', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'more.I', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'director', 'co-screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'films', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'past', 'most', 'recently', 'Truman', 'Show', 'vehicle', 'star', 'top', 'heap', 'moment', 'having', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'knew', 'was', 'depth', 'characters', 'interest', 'books', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'interplay', 'patriotic', 'stuffed-shirt', 'Aubrey', 'subversive', 'idealistic', 'Maturin', 'did', 'minutia', 'who', 'had', 'weather', 'gauge', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'nearly', '200', 'men', 'floating', 'bunch', 'wood.The', 'film', 'captures', 'quite', 'well', 'Crowe', 'Aubrey', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'quite', 'proud', 'full-of-himself', 'books', 'fact', 'movie', 'hardly', 'chink', 'armor', 'character', 'cleverness', 'resourcefullness', 'just', 'doctor', 'inquistiveness', 'sea', 'naiveity', 'also', 'roughness', 'life', 'showing', 'bilge', 'carpentry', 'lash', 'need', 'rum', 'provisions', 'constant', 'practicing', 'guns', 'best', 'Crowe', 'character', 'important', 'most', 'plot', 'ancilliary', 'follow', 'aspects', 'rest', 'crew', 'midshipman', 'whom', 'others', 'see', 'Jonah', 'young', 'lord', 'who', 'arm', 'first', 'battle', 'doctor', 'wounded', 'critical', 'juncture', 'hesitate', 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'might', 'detract', 'someone', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'action', 'movie', 'truly', 'story', 'one', 'shine.The', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'wood', 'constantly', 'creaking', 'groaning', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'one', 'ever', 'perfect', 'smell-o-vision', 'visuals', 'were', 'enough', 'suggestion', 'twenty', 'books', ""O'Brian"", 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', 'studio', 'head', 'slavering', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'thinking', 'sequel', 'so', 'hope', 'next', 'will', 'feature', 'director', 'as', 'good', 'Weir', 'bring', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Sophie', 'undercover', 'exploits', 'Maturin', 'movie', 'established', 'main', 'characters', 'just', 'first', 'book', 'did', 'sequel', 'be', 'good', 'do', 'just', ""O'Brian"", 'did', 'be', 'more', 'Hornblower', 'Too', 'fascinating', 'look', 'very', 'alien', 'world', 'own', 'today']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Director Peter Weir and the producers of this masterpiece are to be commended for their audacity in creating and releasing a film of this genre in the first place-it just doesn't fit in with the formula age we now live in (just look at some of the mindless reviews this film has received here on amazon).The fictional, though clearly fact-based story takes a snippet of a voyage of the HMS Surprise, an English warship assigned to capture or destroy the Archeron, a French vessel of superior armament and design.  From the very beginning of the film one is assaulted with the idea of just what it was like to be a crewmember on a naval sailing vessel in 1805.  Napoleon Bonaparte was at his zenith on the European Continent; the only place he was not able to dominate was the sea.This film has a realism matched by only the best of the modern war genre; 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan' come to mind.  Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) must make decisions that literally mean life and death to his crewmen, some of whom are mere children.  Painful consequences are written all over the actor's battleworn faces.The incredible battle sequences and the amazing navigation of Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America) are a tour de force of cinematography, CGI effects, and the simply magnificent soundtrack.  I can honestly say the DTS format on this film is among the best sound I have heard in any DVD-it is that good.I have watched this film three times now, and am still as impressed as the first time I saw it.  There is nothing else in the sailing-era genre of naval warfare film that compares with Master and Commander.

747943,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00008W64E,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a movie that is almost impossible not to like. The idiosyncratic world of life aboard a ship (a man-o-war) is in many ways like viewing the universe through the wrong end of a telescope: life with all the relationships, fear, lust, camaraderie, bigotry, animal drives for survival, agony of death from the eyes of the dying and the eyes of those surviving become a microcosm of life beyond the vast stretches of sea to that on the Continents of the civilized world in the year 1805. Patrick O'Brien's epics are well served down to the last detail of grit and grime and ship etiquette as captured by director Peter Weir.The claustrophobia of confinement aboard a ship at sea is staggeringly well depicted. The lighting, the inevitable fog, the allegiance of a crew to its Captain, the British use of young midshipmen, the close relationship between the Captain and his ship's physician (they rise above the rawness of ship life by playing duets on the violin and cello at night in the Captain's quarters), the gore of naval battles both across ships and after boarding an enemy ship - all are extraordinary. The actors are excellent - especially Paul Bethany as the physician and Russell Crowe as the Captain. The music score is utterly breathtaking as it uses Ralph Vaughn-Williams ""Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis"", Bocherini, Bach and some wonderful sea shanties to realize a very British atmosphere. The music is there when it is necessary, not merely to bolster the magnitude of the sound of noisy battle.So why is the sum of the parts greater than the whole? For this viewer all the splendor and production values somehow bury the importance of who these men truly are. Perhaps that is Weir's (and O'Brian's) choice - that the thrust of the story should be about one ship and its crew and destiny. I wonder. This is a splendid movie and I recommend it highly.

We see and feel a lot here and this film is in no hurry to rush to the climax as one is very likely to be hooked after the first scene.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:'MASTER AND COMMANDER: The Far Side of the World', Directed by Peter Weir is a film based on two novels of the same names, set in the Napoleanic War by author Patrick O'Brian. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.--* THE MAJOR PLAYERS *--Russell Crowe  - Captain Jack AubreyPaul Bettany  - Dr. Stephen MaturinBilly Boyd  - Barrett BondenJames D'Arcy  - 1st Lt.

I first saw this movie in a small theater, and was thoroughly captivated by it.The movie starts out with the 28-gun HMS Surprise, Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (a spectacular Russell Crowe) commanding, sailing somewhere off the coast of northern Brazil. Jack has orders to intercept the French privateer Acheron and ""Sink, Burn, or take her a Prize,"" as the French ship is trying to take the Napoleonic wars into Pacific waters.Close to the beginning of the film, the Acheron comes into view in heavy fog. It rakes the Surprise with heavy cannonfire numerous times, giving ship surgeon and captain's friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (an excellent Paul Bettany) numerous casualties to operate on. Jack returns fire but cannot even penetrate the ship's hull at 200 yards with the Surprise's smaller guns.After escaping from the enemy by using the dense fog to their advantage, the Surprise is later found again by the French and pursued at length by the Acheron. ""Lucky"" Jack can think of no way to beat the 44-gun ship in open water until an up-close look at an intricate piece of nature, provided by his friend the doctor, gives him a brilliant idea.With his ship well-disguised, Jack springs his trap in extremely close quarters with the Acheron. He unleashes a broadside and sweeping musket fire on the French privateer before leading his men over the side to board it. The battle that follows is full of suspense, great swordfighting, very well-done and realistic musketry, and other perfectly historically accurate items.The entire movie is very historically accurate, and the immense attention to every little intricate piece of life (and death) aboard a British ship is accurate to the extreme. The period weaponry is fantastic, and the battles are very realistic and well-done. The scenes of the ships sailing in calm, storm, and battle are absolutely convincing, showing what a great job the crew did in utilizing a 20th century replica of a real British ship (the HMS Rose) along with exact replica sets, miniatures, and computer designs.All of the roles (and the entire ship's crew) were cast with the utmost care, with not one bit of bad acting done. Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, and each and every one of the others did an excellent job in his place in the ranks of the Surprise's men. I can think of no one better for the role of captain than Crowe, who did a job that in my opinion should have won him an Oscar for best leading actor.The soundtrack of the film is another distinguishing facet of this movie, making excellent use of percussion and stringed instruments for superb music in any of the film's diverse environments and situations.The documentaries included in the special features of this Collector's Edition are very interesting and informative, showing how the entire cast and crew pulled off such a great film that has already become a classic.All around, this movie is an excellent piece of film-making and not the least bit boring as some say. The intense battles, realistic sailing scenes, perfect historical accuracy, great characters, captivating story, and more make this the must-have film that is sure to become the master and commander of your DVD collection.",5,A Classic and All-Around Excellent Seafaring Story,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,3358,"['two', 'words', 'title', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'outline', 'greatness', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'long', 'review', 'express', 'complete', 'excellence', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'small', 'theater', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'captivated', 'it.The', 'movie', 'out', '28-gun', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'Captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'spectacular', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'commanding', 'sailing', 'somewhere', 'coast', 'northern', 'Brazil', 'Jack', 'orders', 'intercept', 'French', 'privateer', 'Acheron', 'Sink', 'Burn', 'take', 'Prize', 'French', 'ship', 'trying', 'take', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'Pacific', 'waters.Close', 'beginning', 'film', 'Acheron', 'view', 'heavy', 'fog', 'Surprise', 'heavy', 'cannonfire', 'numerous', 'times', 'giving', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'captain', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'excellent', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'numerous', 'casualties', 'operate', 'Jack', 'fire', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'penetrate', 'ship', 'hull', '200', 'yards', 'Surprise', 'smaller', 'guns.After', 'escaping', 'enemy', 'using', 'dense', 'fog', 'advantage', 'Surprise', 'later', 'found', 'again', 'French', 'pursued', 'length', 'Acheron', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'can', 'think', 'way', 'beat', '44-gun', 'ship', 'open', 'water', 'up-close', 'look', 'intricate', 'piece', 'nature', 'provided', 'friend', 'doctor', 'brilliant', 'idea.With', 'ship', 'well-disguised', 'Jack', 'trap', 'extremely', 'close', 'quarters', 'Acheron', 'broadside', 'sweeping', 'musket', 'fire', 'French', 'privateer', 'leading', 'men', 'side', 'board', 'battle', 'full', 'suspense', 'great', 'swordfighting', 'very', 'well-done', 'realistic', 'musketry', 'other', 'perfectly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'items.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'very', 'historically', 'accurate', 'immense', 'attention', 'little', 'intricate', 'piece', 'life', 'death', 'British', 'ship', 'accurate', 'extreme', 'period', 'weaponry', 'fantastic', 'battles', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'well-done', 'scenes', 'ships', 'sailing', 'calm', 'storm', 'battle', 'are', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'showing', 'what', 'great', 'job', 'crew', 'did', 'utilizing', '20th', 'century', 'replica', 'real', 'British', 'ship', 'HMS', 'Rose', 'exact', 'replica', 'sets', 'miniatures', 'computer', 'designs.All', 'roles', 'entire', 'ship', 'crew', 'were', 'cast', 'utmost', 'care', 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'bad', 'acting', 'done', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'one', 'others', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'place', 'ranks', 'Surprise', 'men', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'better', 'role', 'captain', 'Crowe', 'who', 'did', 'job', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'leading', 'actor.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'distinguishing', 'facet', 'movie', 'making', 'excellent', 'use', 'percussion', 'stringed', 'instruments', 'superb', 'music', 'film', 'diverse', 'environments', 'situations.The', 'documentaries', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative', 'showing', 'how', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'already', 'become', 'classic.All', 'around', 'movie', 'excellent', 'piece', 'film-making', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'boring', 'say', 'intense', 'battles', 'realistic', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'perfect', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'great', 'characters', 'captivating', 'story', 'more', 'make', 'must-have', 'film', 'sure', 'become', 'master', 'commander', 'DVD', 'collection']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[8, 9]","I am beginning to believe Russell Crowe is currently the most consistent working actor in terms of starring in quality productions. Of his last nine feature-length films, four were nominated for Best Picture, with ""Master and Commander"" a likely candidate at next year's. Of those four nominations, two - ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" - went on to win the grand statuette.Crowe's recent work is so popular it is no wonder he has been spotted sipping booze with the likes of the Weinstein brothers. In other words, moviegoers haven't seen an act such as Crowe since prime-time Jack - as in Jack Nicholson circa 1969 through 1989.What's more is that Hollywood's leading man is despised by the cinematic powers that be. In an industry now ankle-deep in mediocrity, banking on a successful opening weekend rather than long-term commitment, studios can afford to drop a rank egg and still pocket some sort of profit. Quantity over quality is the mindset. Even though most big-name actors occasionally subscribe to this method, Crowe outwardly stands against such deceptive ploys.To be sure, the day I witness Crowe making a cameo in some Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock chick flick is the day Marlon Brando reveals he is in fact an otherworldly humanoid.In director Peter Weir's latest triumph, ""Master and Commander,"" Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, an Englishman so fierce that the year's other Capt. Jack - Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow - pales in comparison. In fact, if Jack Sparrow can be considered a loose caricature of Keith Richards, then Jack Aubrey is a rigid depiction of Ted Nugent.With 197 souls under his thumb, Lucky Jack - as he is affectionately known - is the commander of the HMS Surprise and has orders to intercept the Acheron, a revolutionary French privateer headed by a man just as intelligent and gritty as Aubrey himself.Shot to appear phantom-like in the foggy waters off the Brazilian coastline, it is the Acheron that deals the first blow after somehow gaining insight to the Surprise's position. With a mighty barrage of firepower, the Acheron handily whips the Surprise in their first encounter, but through uncanny leadership Aubrey is able to slip away behind the blanket of fog and avert total disaster.However, as sung through the vocals of Vera Lynn, ""We'll meet again/ Don't know where/ Don't know when.""Weir takes the opportunity to acquaint the spectator with the crew. Each on-screen construct, no matter how miniscule the role, is true to life. This sets ""Master and Commander"" apart from the ""Pearl Harbors"" and ""Wind Talkers"" of the world. Granted, ""Master and Commander"" is an action film. However, where most contemporary films of the genre resort to such lows as gushy love triangles to complement the medley of special effects, this film relies on faultless acting, a superb script and exceptional camera work. Three irrefutable fail-safes, if I may say.",4,"Finally, an action film as smart as it is riveting",1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2899,"['am', 'beginning', 'believe', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'currently', 'most', 'consistent', 'working', 'actor', 'terms', 'starring', 'quality', 'productions', 'last', 'nine', 'feature-length', 'films', 'four', 'were', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Master', 'Commander', 'likely', 'candidate', 'next', 'year', 'four', 'nominations', 'two', 'Gladiator', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'went', 'win', 'grand', 'statuette.Crowe', 'recent', 'work', 'so', 'popular', 'wonder', 'been', 'spotted', 'sipping', 'booze', 'likes', 'Weinstein', 'brothers', 'other', 'words', 'moviegoers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'act', 'such', 'Crowe', 'prime-time', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'circa', '1969', '1989.What', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'man', 'despised', 'cinematic', 'powers', 'be', 'industry', 'now', 'ankle-deep', 'mediocrity', 'banking', 'successful', 'opening', 'weekend', 'rather', 'long-term', 'commitment', 'studios', 'can', 'afford', 'drop', 'rank', 'egg', 'still', 'pocket', 'sort', 'profit', 'Quantity', 'quality', 'mindset', 'Even', 'most', 'big-name', 'actors', 'occasionally', 'subscribe', 'method', 'Crowe', 'outwardly', 'such', 'deceptive', 'ploys.To', 'be', 'sure', 'day', 'witness', 'Crowe', 'making', 'cameo', 'Hugh', 'Grant/Sandra', 'Bullock', 'chick', 'flick', 'day', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'reveals', 'fact', 'otherworldly', 'humanoid.In', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'latest', 'triumph', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Crowe', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Englishman', 'so', 'year', 'other', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'pales', 'comparison', 'fact', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'loose', 'caricature', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'then', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'rigid', 'depiction', 'Ted', 'Nugent.With', '197', 'souls', 'thumb', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'affectionately', 'known', 'commander', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'orders', 'intercept', 'Acheron', 'revolutionary', 'French', 'privateer', 'headed', 'man', 'just', 'intelligent', 'gritty', 'Aubrey', 'himself.Shot', 'appear', 'phantom-like', 'foggy', 'waters', 'Brazilian', 'coastline', 'Acheron', 'first', 'blow', 'somehow', 'gaining', 'insight', 'Surprise', 'position', 'mighty', 'barrage', 'firepower', 'Acheron', 'handily', 'Surprise', 'first', 'encounter', 'uncanny', 'leadership', 'Aubrey', 'able', 'slip', 'away', 'blanket', 'fog', 'avert', 'total', 'disaster.However', 'sung', 'vocals', 'Vera', 'Lynn', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'again/', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where/', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'Weir', 'opportunity', 'acquaint', 'spectator', 'crew', 'on-screen', 'construct', 'matter', 'how', 'role', 'true', 'life', 'Master', 'Commander', 'apart', 'Pearl', 'Harbors', 'Wind', 'Talkers', 'world', 'Granted', 'Master', 'Commander', 'action', 'film', 'However', 'where', 'most', 'contemporary', 'films', 'genre', 'resort', 'such', 'lows', 'gushy', 'love', 'triangles', 'complement', 'medley', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'faultless', 'acting', 'superb', 'script', 'exceptional', 'camera', 'work', 'Three', 'irrefutable', 'fail-safes', 'may', 'say']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

One minor quip is the dialog channel is weak and needs equalization, as its often drowned out by sound effects.The BD transfer has the flatness of movie film but details are far sharper and clearer, so many of the background elements have more detail given the higher quality of BD.  However, the BD version is far less a revolution in clarity, the DVD is still quite good.While I know nothing of the book vs movie version, the Napoleon era nautical style and medicine I know something of.  History buffs will revel at the detailed accuracy of much of the movie, making it worth watching multiple times: small details as the knots used, the way sails are deployed, faint mumblings in the background of nautical commands as the ship in put in order, the surgical equipment and style, the dialog old English, are all period accurate with ne'er a fault, IMHO.The deleted scenes are a shame, as its inclusion as a director's cut would have added more to the characters than the theatrical release, and are well worth viewing.

Read the other reviews for information on the acting and action, I am writing to stand up for the lowly Iguana.Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana, the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal which lives on land but grazes on a variety of seaweed, either on exposed rocks or by diving into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas, provides them with an abundant food source but can make them vulnerable to predation by sharks and other large fish.In the movie, there are scenes reminiscent of Darwin's ""Voyage of the Beagle"", many of the characters are seen collecting what are supposed to be marine iguanas.  However, are these actual Galapagos marine iguanas?  No.  These are actually the common Green Iguanas of South America.  They are not even using costumes or makeup, just their natural green skin.  It is like they are acting on the stage.  Do these iguanas get credit at the end of the movie?  No!  Like Kermit the frog said, Its not easy being green.

747977,AQJDBWTIWQW08,B00008W64E,JBGood,"[6, 6]","Excellent Napoleonic seafaring tale recounting the lone pursuit by HMS Surprise of the French warship Acheron set in 1805 in the South Atlantic and Pacific. The acting performances are top level throughout whether we're talking about Russell Crowe's Captain Aubrey of the Surprise or any of the other shipboard mates and midshipmen. The movie provides close-up and brutal battle action featuring 18-inch guns and on-board swashbuckling scuffles that take the fight right into your 5.1 surround home theater room.Highlights of this atmospheric film include the opening battle with the Acheron, sailing through a dangerous storm at Cape Horn with enormous waves thrusting at the ship, an all too brief visit by the ship's naturalist to the Galapagos to check out the animal life, musical duet by Crowe and ship's surgeon Paul Bettany, and the final encounter and victory over the Acheron.In between we get a realistic look at daily shipboard life and the usual protocol and conflicts between midshipmen and the crew and the captain. While impatient viewers may lust for more intense action here, these scenes do everything to make the story all the more realistic. This is the kind of film that becomes even more appreciated on repeated viewings.The Blu-ray production is mostly first-rate including ship detail, uniforms, facial features, and even the texture of paper on written letters and seacharts. It did seem like some initial terrain scenes in the Galapogos were far less than 1080 lines.Special Features. Fox previews are here where they belong. The Map feature allows you to press Enter anytime to display a map in the lower corner which indicates the current position of the HMS Surprise.Deleted scenes - Many of these should have been left in the release: A guy getting his tooth pulled the old-fashioned way is quite humorous as is that of the lad getting tattoed with the basic ink and needle method. Scenes of the Surprise cruising in the open ocean and especially those on the Galapagos where the scene with the tortoses is expanded and the blue-footed booby is examined. These scenes may have added another 15 minutes but would have been worthwhile (future Director's release of course).

747978,A3GUHL469JV8Y1,B00008W64E,"J. C. Liu ""Dr. Jimbob""","[10, 10]","I had admired Master and Commander as a fine film when I saw it in the theater.  We rented the standard widescreen DVD of the set, and fell further in love with it, and tended to leave it on when one of the cable channels was rebroadcasting it.  So I wound up buying a copy of the super-genius deluxe edition.It's a 2-disc set.  The first disc is identical to the standard edition release.  Interestingly there's no director's commentary -- leaving Weir as one of the few filmmakers who wants to have the film speak for itself.The second disc is chock full of behind-the-scenes features, much of which concentrates on the phenomenal levels of effort that were required to synthesize much of the footage in the movie.  The CGI team worked with a life-sized recreation of a 19th century tall ship, a ""bigature"" (very large miniature) in a tank, footage taken as a Captain Cook recreation sailed around Cape Horn, and a batch of other stuff.  Weir started off committed to trying to make the thing look and feel as realistic as possible, and it becomes clear from the featurettes on model shots, CGI work and sound design that there isn't a thing on the screen that Weir didn't want to be there.  His group's fanatical attention to detail reminds me of the behind the scenes work of Akira Kurosawa's team at its very finest.  And each reviewing of the movie brings out more levels of detail (even as the illusion has been broken -- no, that's not really a guy being left behind in a storm at Cape Horn, though I was fooled in the theater), including the interesting characterization of Lord Blakeney as the sort of ""fighting naturalist"" that he mentions in the film -- part man-of-action as Aubrey is, part contemplative man-of-science as Maturin is.  Too bad there are no plans for a sequel; I for one would love to see how Blakeney turns out.For devotees of the film, filmmaking and Peter Weir, this is more than worth the money and an essential part of our library.",5,CGI finds its Kurosawa,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,1965,"['had', 'admired', 'Master', 'Commander', 'fine', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'rented', 'standard', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'set', 'fell', 'further', 'love', 'tended', 'leave', 'when', 'one', 'cable', 'channels', 'was', 'rebroadcasting', 'So', 'wound', 'up', 'buying', 'copy', 'super-genius', 'deluxe', 'edition.It', '2-disc', 'set', 'first', 'disc', 'identical', 'standard', 'edition', 'release', 'Interestingly', 'director', 'commentary', 'leaving', 'Weir', 'one', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'film', 'speak', 'itself.The', 'second', 'disc', 'chock', 'full', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'much', 'phenomenal', 'levels', 'effort', 'were', 'required', 'synthesize', 'much', 'footage', 'movie', 'CGI', 'team', 'worked', 'life-sized', 'recreation', '19th', 'century', 'tall', 'ship', 'bigature', 'very', 'large', 'miniature', 'tank', 'footage', 'taken', 'Captain', 'Cook', 'recreation', 'sailed', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'batch', 'other', 'stuff', 'Weir', 'started', 'off', 'committed', 'trying', 'make', 'thing', 'look', 'feel', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'clear', 'featurettes', 'model', 'shots', 'CGI', 'work', 'sound', 'design', ""n't"", 'thing', 'screen', 'Weir', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'group', 'fanatical', 'attention', 'detail', 'reminds', 'scenes', 'work', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'team', 'very', 'finest', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'out', 'more', 'levels', 'detail', 'even', 'illusion', 'been', 'broken', 'not', 'really', 'guy', 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'storm', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'was', 'fooled', 'theater', 'including', 'interesting', 'characterization', 'Lord', 'Blakeney', 'sort', 'fighting', 'naturalist', 'film', 'part', 'man-of-action', 'Aubrey', 'part', 'contemplative', 'man-of-science', 'Maturin', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'plans', 'sequel', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'how', 'Blakeney', 'out.For', 'devotees', 'film', 'filmmaking', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'more', 'money', 'essential', 'part', 'library']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747979,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00008W64E,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 0]","Master and CommanderFabulous View from the Crowe's NestI avoided ""Master and Commander"" for awhile, unwilling to face disappointment. The movie looked cool, and with the ever-admirable Russell Crowe at the helm, seemingly a sure winner. But what if it was terrible?I finally faced my fear and found to my delight that ""Master and Commander"" is a wonderfully rich and varied experience that was well worth the wait. The film's action is fairly straightforward. An English man-o-war, the ""Surprise,"" must intercept the much swifter and stronger French ""Acheron"" before it reaches the Pacific and spreads Napoleon's empire into that hemisphere. But to this basic period chase story is added a fast-paced plot, a wonderful cast, superb effects, excellent performances and more twists than a cat-o-nine. Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, a brave and audacious pilot who has spent much of his life aboard the Surprise. The boat is well past its prime, but Audrey knows how to squeeze every ounce of speed out of her. Paul Bettany shines, or rather glowers as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is a cynic, an old friend of Aubrey's and the ship's talented surgeon, whose land-bound habits and moral code make him a perfect foil for Crowe. When the two aren't fighting each other, they are playing classical strings pieces in the Captain's cabin.""Master and Commander"" masterfully mixes disparate are elements - the sailors' superstitions and their Christian piety when burying at sea; their fighting prowess alongside their tenderness toward their sick comrades; their love of grog along their dogged will to work. The film includes a number of scenes and characters that could easily have descended into clich&eacute;: the amputation; the noble-yet-caring captain; the encounter with native women. But smart writing and a focus on the mission keep both the Surprise's crew and the film's plot focused. Special applause goes to Max Pirkis as a doughty young midshipman. Sharp-eyed viewers will also note Billy Boyd (filmed in the midst of his role as Pippin in ""The Lord of the Rings"") as a rambunctious coxswain.M&C; is quick-footed and thrilling, with battle scenes that are breathtakingly brutal. The effects of cannon shot on a ship's hull have never been so convincingly rendered. The camaraderie among the crew is heartwarming and sincere. The plot line is far from predictable. And finally, a movie that does not insult a viewer's intelligence! The film's final shot tells us, without needing to show us, what happens as the credits are rolling. Terrific, terrific, terrific!(There are no DVD extras to speak of apart from a few previews. Alas!

I had watched the movie through once and felt I had missed a lot because much of the dialog seemed gibberish.  I immediately watched it a second time with closed captioning on and it helped a lot.This movie has humor action and a certain reality of sea warfare.  Imagine a 12 year old officer, son of a lord commanding a group of low born navel sailor.  If you had a hard time imagining Luke Skywalker leading Rogue Squadron at age 16 and Princess Leia leading the rebels at age 19, how about age 12.  This was the royal navy in 1805.  A 16 year old was a third Lt. ranking high enough to join the officers mess and lead men into a battle.  And the navy men followed.The movie is PG13 but the violence was not gory.  There is no nudity or cursing that we recall so we judge this movie to be family friendly.  More evidence that a director can make a great movie with a superior script, great acting and outstanding cinematography and special effects.  The opening battle with the sound of projectiles flying by makes you feel you are right there.. Makes you want to duck down.Russell Crowe is incredible as the extremely bright, creative naval tactician and captian of the HMS Surprise who leads his men with a positive, confident swagger.  The men have nicknamed him Lucky Jack Aubrey.So many things make this an outstanding movie that I must give it a, rare for me, 5 star rating.

However, it is the acting, the relationships, and the subplots that make this movie soar for me. I think Crowe does a great job. There is a good supporting caste. Crowe displays well the inner turmoil over the hard decisions he has to make that affect the life of his crew. The sea is itself a character in the movie. The images of daily life on the sea are compelling as well. The battle scenes are done well. The strategies and subterfuge the opposing captains play on each other are enjoyable.

747983,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00008W64E,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 0]","Russell Crowe (Capt. Jack Aubrey) stars in this classic sea epic about naval warfare during the Napoleonic wars.  The year is 1805 and Napoleon's armies are set to invade England.  The world's oceans have now become battlefields as well.  The French frigate Acheron has been sent to the South Atlantic Ocean to journey around South America and into the Pacific Ocean to raid English whaling vessels.Capt. Aubrey's vessel, the HMS Surprise, stands in the Acheron's way.  After a battle off of the Brazillian coast in which the Surprise suffered considerable damage, the French ship made good its escape.  Faster than its English counterpart, it is able to increase the distance between itself and the slower British ship.During the course of the movie, the viewer gets to experience sailing, sea tactics, and life in general aboard a sailing ship.  Young officers who were in fact pre-teenage children were routinely placed aboard these vessels to learn the art of seamanship from the more experienced crewmembers.  Capt. Aubrey lends in his navigational talents to the training.  Battles are ferocious and often deadly, and young and old alike are the unfortunate casualties.  The overcrowding, poor food, and mental stress of being cramped on a ship for months on end is accurately portrayed, as well.  However, the men are sustained by the thrill of the chase and moments of courage, especially by Capt. Aubrey.Tough choices are made as well, such as when one of the crewmembers is swept overboard, but Capt. Aubrey is forced to make the agonizing decision to leave him behind rather than risk his ship and crew.Starring along with Crowe is Paul Bettany, who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  He provides a kind of antithesis to Capt. Aubrey's sense of duty.  The pair play music together, eat together, and get drunk together, and there is a true sense of trust and friendship among them.  While chasing the Acheron, the Surprise stops in the Galapagos islands, where Dr. Maturin discovers many different species of animals, but Capt. Aubrey informs the doctor that the Surprise must resume the pursuit of the Acheron.  This decision drives a wedge between the Captain and the doctor.Upon sighting the Acheron, Capt. Aubrey comes up with a plan to disguise his ship as a whaling vessel in the hopes of drawing the bigger and heavier-armed Acheron closer.  The plan works, and a teriffic sea battle ensues.  Will the Acheron win, or will Aubrey's Surprise pull of a ""surprise"" of its own?This is an excellent movie.  The action is non-stop, and Russell Crowe does a magnificent job as the charismatic Capt. Aubrey.  Life aboard a sailing ship in the early 1800s is accurately shown, and the sea battles are truly exhilarating.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of great sea action and adventure will surely enjoy this great movie.",5,An Epic Sea Adventure,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2862,"['Russell', 'Crowe', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'classic', 'sea', 'epic', 'naval', 'warfare', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'year', '1805', 'Napoleon', 'armies', 'are', 'set', 'invade', 'England', 'world', 'oceans', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'battlefields', 'well', 'French', 'frigate', 'Acheron', 'been', 'sent', 'South', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'journey', 'South', 'America', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'raid', 'English', 'whaling', 'vessels.Capt', 'Aubrey', 'vessel', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'Acheron', 'way', 'battle', 'Brazillian', 'coast', 'Surprise', 'suffered', 'considerable', 'damage', 'French', 'ship', 'made', 'good', 'escape', 'Faster', 'English', 'counterpart', 'able', 'increase', 'distance', 'slower', 'British', 'ship.During', 'course', 'movie', 'viewer', 'experience', 'sailing', 'sea', 'tactics', 'life', 'general', 'sailing', 'ship', 'Young', 'officers', 'who', 'were', 'fact', 'pre-teenage', 'children', 'were', 'routinely', 'placed', 'vessels', 'learn', 'art', 'seamanship', 'more', 'experienced', 'crewmembers', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'navigational', 'talents', 'training', 'Battles', 'are', 'ferocious', 'often', 'deadly', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'casualties', 'overcrowding', 'poor', 'food', 'mental', 'stress', 'being', 'cramped', 'ship', 'months', 'end', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'men', 'are', 'sustained', 'thrill', 'chase', 'moments', 'courage', 'especially', 'Capt', 'Aubrey.Tough', 'choices', 'are', 'made', 'well', 'such', 'when', 'one', 'crewmembers', 'swept', 'overboard', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'forced', 'make', 'agonizing', 'decision', 'leave', 'rather', 'risk', 'ship', 'crew.Starring', 'along', 'Crowe', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'kind', 'antithesis', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'sense', 'duty', 'pair', 'play', 'music', 'together', 'eat', 'together', 'get', 'drunk', 'together', 'true', 'sense', 'trust', 'friendship', 'chasing', 'Acheron', 'Surprise', 'Galapagos', 'islands', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'many', 'different', 'species', 'animals', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'doctor', 'Surprise', 'must', 'resume', 'pursuit', 'Acheron', 'decision', 'wedge', 'Captain', 'doctor.Upon', 'sighting', 'Acheron', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'up', 'plan', 'disguise', 'ship', 'whaling', 'vessel', 'hopes', 'drawing', 'bigger', 'heavier-armed', 'Acheron', 'closer', 'plan', 'teriffic', 'sea', 'battle', 'ensues', 'Will', 'Acheron', 'win', 'will', 'Aubrey', 'Surprise', 'pull', 'surprise', 'own', 'excellent', 'movie', 'action', 'non-stop', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'magnificent', 'job', 'charismatic', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'Life', 'sailing', 'ship', 'early', '1800s', 'accurately', 'shown', 'sea', 'battles', 'are', 'truly', 'exhilarating.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'Fans', 'great', 'sea', 'action', 'adventure', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'great', 'movie']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
747984,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B00008W64E,Jeremy Berman,"[5, 5]","Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is the latest attempt by the Hollywood establishment to revive the nautical adventure genre that enjoyed great popularity during Hollywood's ""golden age."" Based on Patrick O'Brian's phenomenally successful novels about British heroism during the Napoleonic Wars, the film traces the efforts of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his loyal crew to intercept and destroy an errant French warship in the Pacific waters near the Galapagos Islands. Although this movie will disappoint any audience member who is expecting a great deal of background information about the historical intricacies and personalities of the Napoleonic Age, it will thrill and entertain all filmgoers who love the kinetic energy and old-fashioned showmanship of a well directed swashbuckler.Veteran director Peter Weir is entitled to an Oscar nomination simply for staging some of the most dazzling and exhilarating naval battle sequences of all-time. The violent encounters between Aubrey's HMS Surprise and its French counterpart the Acheron were so gripping and realistic that several audience members at the showing I attended were literally gasping for breath as they left the theater (the sound of cannon fire and rushing water no doubt reverberating in their ears). However, Weir deserves the most credit for his detailed and provocative portrayal of every aspect of life aboard a British warship, circa 1805. Audiences get to see the chief lieutenants create strategies and chart courses, the midshipman cope with the responsibilities holding authority over much of the crew while still conforming to the expectations of their superiors, and the common sailors, mates and boatswain confront unbearable weather and inedible food as they prepare to risk their lives for the country they love. Several characters leave an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of viewers, particularly Max Pirkis as a prepubescent crew member who faces the amputation of an arm with unwavering courage and Lee Ingleby as an indecisive midshipman who becomes convinced that his presence is cursing the ship. The battle scenes owe much of their punch and power to Weir's realization that it is far more engaging to watch complex, multifaceted figures battle it out for God and country than it is to watch caricatured personalities scramble through combat without purpose or motivation.At the center of the fray is Russell Crowe, who thoroughly captures Captain Aubrey's intensity and charisma. It isn't easy to play a character that orders the vicious beating of an unruly sailor in one scene and makes charming toasts to wives and sweethearts (""may they never meet!"") in another, but Crowe succeeds brilliantly by imagining Aubrey as an impulsive individualist who stands by his instincts and emotions in any context. When the Captain engages in heated philosophical discussions about loyalty and leadership with his friend Dr. Steven Maturin (Paul Bettany), it is riveting to watch the star's fascinating portrait of a man obsessed with his own righteousness. Crowe will almost certainly reap some significant awards from this impressive performance, and at the very least he has found a profitable new franchise to sail through the rest of the decade with.",5,Masterful and Commanding,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3271,"['Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'latest', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'establishment', 'revive', 'nautical', 'adventure', 'genre', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'popularity', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'Based', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'novels', 'British', 'heroism', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'film', 'efforts', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'loyal', 'crew', 'intercept', 'destroy', 'errant', 'French', 'warship', 'Pacific', 'waters', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'audience', 'member', 'who', 'expecting', 'great', 'deal', 'background', 'information', 'historical', 'intricacies', 'personalities', 'Napoleonic', 'Age', 'will', 'thrill', 'entertain', 'filmgoers', 'who', 'love', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'old-fashioned', 'showmanship', 'well', 'directed', 'swashbuckler.Veteran', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'entitled', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'simply', 'staging', 'most', 'dazzling', 'exhilarating', 'naval', 'battle', 'sequences', 'all-time', 'violent', 'encounters', 'Aubrey', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'French', 'counterpart', 'Acheron', 'were', 'so', 'gripping', 'realistic', 'several', 'audience', 'members', 'showing', 'attended', 'were', 'literally', 'gasping', 'breath', 'left', 'theater', 'sound', 'cannon', 'fire', 'rushing', 'water', 'doubt', 'reverberating', 'ears', 'However', 'Weir', 'most', 'credit', 'detailed', 'provocative', 'portrayal', 'aspect', 'life', 'British', 'warship', 'circa', '1805', 'Audiences', 'get', 'see', 'chief', 'lieutenants', 'create', 'strategies', 'chart', 'courses', 'midshipman', 'cope', 'responsibilities', 'holding', 'authority', 'much', 'crew', 'still', 'conforming', 'expectations', 'superiors', 'common', 'sailors', 'mates', 'boatswain', 'confront', 'unbearable', 'weather', 'inedible', 'food', 'prepare', 'risk', 'lives', 'country', 'love', 'Several', 'characters', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'hearts', 'minds', 'viewers', 'particularly', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'prepubescent', 'crew', 'member', 'who', 'amputation', 'arm', 'unwavering', 'courage', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'indecisive', 'midshipman', 'who', 'convinced', 'presence', 'cursing', 'ship', 'battle', 'owe', 'much', 'punch', 'power', 'Weir', 'realization', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'watch', 'complex', 'multifaceted', 'figures', 'battle', 'out', 'God', 'country', 'watch', 'caricatured', 'personalities', 'scramble', 'combat', 'purpose', 'motivation.At', 'center', 'fray', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'intensity', 'charisma', ""n't"", 'easy', 'play', 'character', 'orders', 'vicious', 'beating', 'unruly', 'sailor', 'one', 'scene', 'charming', 'toasts', 'wives', 'sweethearts', 'may', 'never', 'meet', 'Crowe', 'brilliantly', 'imagining', 'Aubrey', 'impulsive', 'individualist', 'who', 'instincts', 'emotions', 'context', 'When', 'Captain', 'engages', 'heated', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'loyalty', 'leadership', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Steven', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'riveting', 'watch', 'star', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'man', 'obsessed', 'own', 'righteousness', 'Crowe', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'reap', 'significant', 'awards', 'impressive', 'performance', 'very', 'least', 'found', 'profitable', 'new', 'franchise', 'sail', 'rest', 'decade']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

The writing was more appropriate to a period peice from the silent movie era than a current film.  And it has every stock character from a naval movie ever.  The weak officer, the near mutiny, the enemy ship who always appears like a ghost, the superstitous old sailor, etc., etc.  The dialogue was as wooden as the dialogue in Star Wars Phantom Menace and rarely gave Russell Crowe a chance to demonstrate his talent.It gets two stars for being SO formulaic.  At least all of the completely predictable events were there, enough to give all of the hack critics out there a woody.

I'm sure those who read the book will be happy with it, but why you would want to pay eight bucks for something with no new fresh life is beyond me.There's a reason this movie got beat out by Elf in it's debut week (despite the fact that Elf had already been out a week).

747999,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00008W64E,John Kwok,"[12, 12]","Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey. Dr. Stephen Maturin. These are the most celebrated pair of characters in 20th Century fiction; the nautical equivalents of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, or perhaps more aptly, the British Royal Navy counterparts of Starfleet's Captain James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock. Now thanks to the splendid direction by Peter Weir and the elegant writing by him and his fellow screenwriters, they have finally been brought to life, thanks in no small measure to the splendid performances given by actors Russell Crowe (Aubrey) and Paul Bettany (Maturin). Theirs are performances which should not be ignored by the Academy Awards early next year, along with yet another stellar performance from the young Max Pirkus as Midshipman Lord Blakeney. Weir's splendid film is the finest nautical epic I've seen, a gripping, painstakingly, realistic depiction of what life was like aboard a British Royal Navy frigate during the Napoleonic wars. Fellow diehard fans of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series may quibble with Weir's translation of ""The Far Side Of The World"" (the film is a loose adaptation of that novel, coupled with scenes from the first in the series, ""Master and Commander"" and one scene that seems to have come straight from the pages of ""Desolation Island"".), but Weir has successfully translated O'Brian's fictional histories to the silver screen. With the notable exception of Paul Bettany's Maturin, who seems a bit too tall for the part, the actors portraying lieutenants Pulling and Mowett and coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, The Lord of the Ring's ""Pippin""), strongly resemble the literary portraits depicted in O'Brian's finely crafted, exquisite, and often lyrical, prose. Hopefully this won't be the last installment in a cinematic series based on O'Brian's novels.The year is 1805. Her Britannic Majesty's 28 gun frigate HMS Surprise, under the command of the legendary frigate captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, is off the coast of Brazil, in pursuit of a larger French privateer, the Acheron, which is known to be sailing towards the Pacific Ocean and the lucrative whaling grounds favored by British whalers (Editorial Note: In O'Brian's novel, the enemy ship is a large American frigate, USS Norfolk, on the same errand as the French privateer.). Caught off guard by his deadly foe in a brief, almost fatal, ambush, Aubrey must command his crew to make repairs aboard ship. Meanwhile he finds himself engaged in a spirited test of wills with his thoughtful, eloquent friend - and the ship's surgeon and naturalist - Stephen Maturin. Aubrey takes the Surprise around Cape Horn, on a perilous chase, soon after the Acheron is sighted off the Patagonian coast. Once in the Pacific, Aubrey must contend with calm seas, an unexpected injury to Maturin, and the prospect of an idyllic interlude in the Galapagos Islands, before waging a final, desperate battle against the larger French warship.I have waited a long time for this film, wondering whether it could ever be done right. Thankfully, Peter Weir and his team have created an intellectuall action-adventure masterpiece that remains true to the spirit of O'Brian's fiction.

748003,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00008W64E,Joseph Haschka,"[2, 3]","MASTER AND COMMANDER is one of those Hollywood, old-style swashbuckling epics produced just for the fun (and expected profit) of it. It's without any touchy-feely social agenda, tiresome political correctness, or warm and fuzzy lessons of the ""I'm ok; you're ok"" ilk. I loved it!Russell Crowe is Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, commanding His Britannic Majesty's fighting ship, the 28-gun Surprise. It's 1805, England is at war (again!) with the French, and Aubrey is ordered to  the waters off Brazil to take out a marauding French privateer, the Acheron. Within the first 20 minutes, the Surprise is ambushed in the fog by the Acheron, and barely escapes. We never find out why Jack is called ""Lucky"", but we do learn that he's a generally victorious commander. So, it's not unexpected that he takes this defeat badly, and spends the rest of the film stalking the much larger (40+ guns) and more modern French vessel.The focus of M&C; is on Aubrey and his friendship with the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who's the only one aboard with the license to tell the Captain when he's lost perspective. And, one of the film's most interesting aspects is its depiction of the at-sea, combat surgery of the time. It's not a visit to your friendly HMO.Perhaps the most intriguing character, beyond Aubrey, is that of Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), a boy of perhaps 10 or 11 years, who loses an arm in the first engagement with the Acheron. Viewers may be surprised to learn that such youngsters served in the Royal Navy during that period. You grew into a man in short order. The performance by young Pirkis may merit an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Accustomed as we are to fast police chases on the evening news, it's revealing to see the nature of ocean pursuits in the days of sail. It sometimes took many, many hours for one ship to overtake another to the point of being within firing range. And, when it does, all hell breaks loose. In the low-ceilinged gun deck, the seaman must dodge recoiling cannons, while managing not to slip on the blood-slick, pitching deck nor concuss his head on the overhead.It must be noted that there are no significant female roles in M&C.; At one point, 4 working girls appear in a skiff beside a re-victualing Surprise, but they're gone without speaking after merely seconds of screen time. This is all about Guys bonding, playing sailor, going without baths, and swinging sharp blades.Near the end of the film, Captain Jack exhorts his men to do their duty ""for England"" and ""the prize"". While the last is, in context, the Acheron, Twentieth Century Fox may see it as the Best Picture Oscar.

I've never been able to notice this sort of thing well so I won't bore anybody with my pathetic observations. I just want to explain the main points I feel this movie impresses on the viewer. Films never seem to be neutral - they always say something about how to live, or at least what comprises normal living. And a lot of the modern material Hollywood pumps out strikes me as shallow and unbeneficial. I can only see so many movies with great, awe-inspiring, muscular action heros who have no moral backbone before I start getting disillusioned with the cinema scene.What I really liked about this movie was that it had a great view of what it's like to be a good man and leader. It showed the difficult decisions a leader like Jack Aubrey has to face, the courage and shrewdness required, the necessity of laughter and a good sense of humor, and a good sense of moral behavior and fulfillment of duty. It showed the need for not just fighting ability but also wisdom and culture - Captain Aubrey read literature, played his violin, and clearly was an educated man as set apart from the no-brains-all-brawn hero of too many of today's films. It portrayed the bravery and heroism possible even in boys; I thought the boy who had his arm amputated played his part very well, showing courage and conviction. A good dose of these traits are useful in the life of any man (or woman, for that matter).I suppose it can be argued whether this was a technical masterpiece or something of a loser (I lean toward the former, of course *grin*). But I think it is clear from the get-go that this movie teaches very well how a leader should live. If I ever have any children, and boys in particular, I will definitely want them to watch this at the appropriate time. Courage and uprightness are something I think every parent would be proud to see in their children. This movie can help bring that about.",5,Good movie for boys to watch,1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,1971,"['lot', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'technical', 'points', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'notice', 'sort', 'thing', 'well', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'anybody', 'pathetic', 'observations', 'just', 'want', 'explain', 'main', 'points', 'feel', 'movie', 'viewer', 'Films', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'neutral', 'always', 'say', 'something', 'how', 'live', 'least', 'what', 'normal', 'living', 'lot', 'modern', 'material', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'strikes', 'shallow', 'unbeneficial', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'great', 'awe-inspiring', 'muscular', 'action', 'heros', 'who', 'have', 'moral', 'backbone', 'start', 'getting', 'disillusioned', 'cinema', 'scene.What', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'great', 'view', 'what', 'be', 'good', 'man', 'leader', 'showed', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'leader', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'face', 'courage', 'shrewdness', 'required', 'necessity', 'laughter', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'good', 'sense', 'moral', 'behavior', 'fulfillment', 'duty', 'showed', 'need', 'not', 'just', 'fighting', 'ability', 'also', 'wisdom', 'culture', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'read', 'literature', 'played', 'violin', 'clearly', 'was', 'educated', 'man', 'set', 'apart', 'no-brains-all-brawn', 'hero', 'too', 'many', 'today', 'films', 'portrayed', 'bravery', 'heroism', 'possible', 'even', 'boys', 'thought', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'arm', 'amputated', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'showing', 'courage', 'conviction', 'good', 'dose', 'traits', 'are', 'useful', 'life', 'man', 'woman', 'matter', 'suppose', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'was', 'technical', 'masterpiece', 'something', 'loser', 'lean', 'former', 'course', '*grin*', 'think', 'clear', 'get-go', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'leader', 'should', 'live', 'ever', 'have', 'children', 'boys', 'particular', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'appropriate', 'time', 'Courage', 'uprightness', 'are', 'something', 'think', 'parent', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'see', 'children', 'movie', 'can', 'help', 'bring']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

First of all, Peter Weir proved to be a very intelligent director, making the viewers totally at ease and making me feel I was part of Aubrey's crew. Sometimes it seemed I was on the deck of HMS Surprise.Second, though the story is not original and really showed no surprises (no pun intended), the screenplay is very good. At first sight, a 130-minute movie that goes on pratically only aboard a ship seems dull and boring. But the scenes are always significant to the context of the film, and the screenplay provides interesting insights on the characters' personalities, not only the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and the Doctor Maturin) but minor ones as well. I think the children's and teenagers' acting was great. The battle scenes are impressive, and the quiet and sometimes funny scenes on Galapagos Islands proved to be a nice interlude.Surprisingly, Russel Crowe is not in his acclaimed usual macho-style as in ""Gladatior"" and ""Proof of life"". He plays Jack Aubrey as a commanding but sensitive man (his musical scenes with the doctor are great - in fact the music in the movie is very good and appropriate).

Russell Crowe turns in another wonderful performance as the captain, and the rest of the cast gives a wonderful feeling of being on a real ocean-going sea vessel.Watch out for the first character you see on film:  don't let his size fool you, nobody in this movie is the size of a hobbit!",4,"Good movie, with a few dull spots",1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,920,"['When', 'say', 'dull', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'boring', 'rather', 'confusing', 'unnecessary', 'Not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'one', 'fight', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'disorienting', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'was', 'winning', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'not', 'chaotic', 'sub-par', 'fight', 'sequence', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'five', 'stars', 'True', 'fight', 'dark', 'dank', 'ship', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'clear', 'clear', 'watch', 'two', 'knights', 'horses', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'took', 'world', 'film', 'tried', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'eyes', 'were', 'telling', 'me.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'however', 'highest', 'calibre', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'captain', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'feeling', 'being', 'real', 'ocean-going', 'sea', 'vessel.Watch', 'first', 'character', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'size', 'fool', 'nobody', 'movie', 'size', 'hobbit']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

748019,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00008W64E,Kaya Savas,"[2, 5]","MOVIE: This film is about the story of Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew on the HMS Surprise. The film takes place during the times of the Napoleonic Wars at sea. What makes this film a winner is the fact that it was able to stay incredibly historically accurate and still maintain is entertaining value. Most movies that try to be historically accurate tend to fail miserable due to them being . . . well . . . boring! Take Gods and Generals for example. Anyway, the film documents the adventures and journeys of this ship as it fights for their country and themselves. I guess what made this movie so exciting was the incredible sound and visuals. At $150 million, the movie was no cheap fare to make. Unfortunately it did horribly at the box office and was the reason that the movie was split between three different distributors (20th Century Fox, Universal, and Miramax). What really makes this film so enjoyable is the fact that it has such a fantastic ensemble cast. As you've expected, Russell Crowe is the star of the show, but without the supporting cast his performance would have gone to waste. A terrific film, one of the best of its kind, and something that you can take with you to history class and to your home theater.VIDEO: The video of this DVD is incredible. Your HDTV will certainly get its run for the money, mine sure did. This two disc set comes in anamorphic widescreen in a 2.40:1 ratio.AUDIO: Here you get an amazing DTS and Dolby 5.1 mix that will knock your socks off. The sound of this movie is incredible and needs mixes like these.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I have the two disc edition. I personally feel that the only reason why we have the choice of one disc and two disc editions is because of the poor performance at the box office. So in order to get as much money as they could, they put two discs in a fancy shmancy box and charge a lot for it. Then they give the option of a disc with absolutely nothing on it so buyers of the two disc set feel special. Honestly the extras are nothing to bananas over. It's not a great amount and they are not all that special. In this set you get trailers and tv spots, 70 minute behind the scenes documentary, how they adapted the movie from the books, moviemaking secrets, sound design featurette, cannon demonstration, 6 deleted scenes, multi angle scenes, and a split scene vignette. When someone buys something they always want it to be the better of its kind. So knowing how the human mind works, Fox released a bare bones release and a normal two disc set wrapped all pretty and slapped a big price tag for that. Naturally the consumer will buy the better set. I don't see why the consumer has to suffer just because their marketing failed during the theatrical release. The set is good though, I'm just complaining about how they released it and priced it, that's all.Movie Score: (4 Stars / 5 Stars)DVD Score: (8 / 10)",4,A Rare Film That Is Historically Accurate & Entertaining,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,2895,"['MOVIE', 'film', 'story', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'film', 'place', 'times', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'sea', 'What', 'film', 'winner', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'stay', 'incredibly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'still', 'maintain', 'entertaining', 'value', 'Most', 'movies', 'try', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'tend', 'fail', 'miserable', 'due', 'being', 'well', 'boring', 'Take', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'example', 'Anyway', 'film', 'documents', 'adventures', 'journeys', 'ship', 'country', 'guess', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'exciting', 'was', 'incredible', 'sound', 'visuals', '150', 'million', 'movie', 'was', 'cheap', 'fare', 'make', 'did', 'horribly', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'split', 'three', 'different', 'distributors', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Universal', 'Miramax', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'star', 'show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'waste', 'terrific', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'kind', 'something', 'can', 'take', 'history', 'class', 'home', 'theater.VIDEO', 'video', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'HDTV', 'will', 'certainly', 'get', 'run', 'money', 'mine', 'sure', 'did', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '2.40:1', 'ratio.AUDIO', 'Here', 'get', 'amazing', 'DTS', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'mix', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'sound', 'movie', 'incredible', 'mixes', 'these.PACKAGING', '/', 'EXTRAS', 'have', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'personally', 'feel', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'have', 'choice', 'one', 'disc', 'two', 'disc', 'editions', 'poor', 'performance', 'box', 'office', 'So', 'order', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'could', 'put', 'two', 'discs', 'fancy', 'shmancy', 'box', 'charge', 'lot', 'Then', 'give', 'option', 'disc', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'buyers', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'feel', 'special', 'Honestly', 'extras', 'are', 'nothing', 'bananas', 'over', 'not', 'great', 'amount', 'are', 'not', 'special', 'set', 'get', 'trailers', 'tv', 'spots', '70', 'minute', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'how', 'adapted', 'movie', 'books', 'moviemaking', 'secrets', 'sound', 'design', 'featurette', 'cannon', 'demonstration', '6', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'multi', 'angle', 'scenes', 'split', 'scene', 'vignette', 'When', 'someone', 'something', 'always', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'kind', 'So', 'knowing', 'how', 'human', 'mind', 'works', 'Fox', 'released', 'bare', 'release', 'normal', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'wrapped', 'pretty', 'slapped', 'big', 'price', 'tag', 'Naturally', 'consumer', 'will', 'buy', 'better', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'consumer', 'suffer', 'just', 'marketing', 'failed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'set', 'good', ""'m"", 'just', 'complaining', 'how', 'released', 'priced', 'all.Movie', 'Score', '4', 'Stars', '/', '5', 'Stars', 'DVD', 'Score', '8', '/', '10']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Along the way, we see Aubrey's softer side, his human side, that usually isn't portrayed in a character of his magnitude and position.  We are shown the bonds of brotherhood that keep the crew together through good times and bad.  We also see how life on a warship can swiftly change from boredom to life-and-death situations, as well as discipline carried out by ranking officials.Overall, I've yet to see a film that reveals so much action, so many emotions, and so much reality into two-and-a-half hour production.

748028,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00008W64E,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","The year is 1805 and the British are in war with Napoleon, who rules over France and most of Europe.  This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.

This film manages to capture the flavor of the books while adding a few twists of it's own.The movie itself is a course in naval history.  Similar period works like the ""Bounty"" opted to almost ignore the complexities involved in operating a ship.  M&C; hits you with a lot of them  at the same time, but credits you with enough intelligence to follow it.No matter what you're looking at; the uniforms, the duties people performed, the tactics, the language, the ship and its fittings, or any other item on the screen, it is both historically accurate and in keeping with the spirit of the book series.  I've heard people complain about the film's depiction of the young midshipmen who acted as junior officers on the ship.  This is how it was, and again the film pulls no punches as to how demanding and brutally unfair this type of life could be.  Others have complained about the ""cheeziness"" of some of the spontaneous singing and instrument work in the movie.  But again I give the film credit for daring to highlight what was actually done for entertainment in those days, long before CD's & TV made music a passive, solitary, spectator event.The only ""groaner"" point in the movie for me involved a bad pun referring to some unwanted vermin in the food.  In the books, Jack is relentlessly unquick when it comes to a play on words.  Yet he'll proudly refer back to the rare incidents years earlier when he actually ""got in a good one"".  In the book series, this adds another tone to the character; but in the movie it came off as a little forced.  Most people are completely unaware of the state of food supplies on a Napoleonic warship, and the movie could have provided an earlier reference to the presence of mold, maggots, weevils, and rats on the ship; and how these extra passengers were accepted matter-of-factly by the crew.I was a little worried about Russel Crowe when I heard he was cast.  The Aubrey character from the books is a hulking, borderline fat, scarred up giant, and I had always pictured the man who played the British officer in ""Last of the Mohicans"" whenever I read the books.  But Crowe delivers again.  Bettany is perfect as Dr. Maturin (significant portions of this character are not revealed in the movie and remain a treat for those who read the books).  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Bonden (played by one of the Hobbit guys).  If I remember correctly from the books, Bonden was a prizefighter, not at all a match for the physicality of this actor. (If I've gotten this wrong please forgive me).One final note is that this movie should have been nominated for, and should have won, an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  To comb through 20 books looking for which bits and peices could be brought together to make a viable, watchable movie, while still remaining true to the source material is an incredible task (the movie differs significantly from the 2 novels named in the title).  This movie pulled it off beautifully.  Even minor characters are given enough screen time to establish them firmly.  From Killick worrying about the silver and muttering under his breath, to ""Awkward"" Davies, a man more useful in a fist-fight than for anything involved with sailing a ship.If you want historically accurate, informative, exciting, complex action, involving some of the most popular, relevant, and influential characters in historical fiction, than this movie is for you.

748035,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B00008W64E,Kona,"[4, 5]","This magnificent, swashbuckling epic takes place during the Napoleonic Wars, aboard the British frigate, HMS Surprise.  Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has orders to destroy, or take as prize, the French warship Acheron, off the coast of Brazil.  Most of the film concerns the day to day life aboard ship and we get to know the men very well.  The Captain is a warm, intelligent man who enjoys puns and playing the violin as much as he loves the sea.  There is the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany) who is the Captain's friend and confidant and  Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), one of many young boys who are learning about the sea and will one day be captains of their own ships.  The crew engage the Acheron in battle, and  the Captain asks the men to defeat the enemy for England, for home, and for the prize.This is Russell Crowe's best role to date, and he rates a 10 on the Macho-Meter.  He is gallant, brave, handsome, and kind in a very appealing performance.  The story is told at a leisurely pace, allowing us to feel the rolling of the ship, the camaraderie of the men, the adventure of it all.  The battle scenes are exciting, but not gory.

748036,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00008W64E,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 1]","MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD stars Russell Crowe as Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, master and commander of the 'HMS Surprise,' on war patrol during the first worldwide war of the Napoleonic era (1805). Crowe is perfectly cast as Aubrey, an intelligent, erudite captain who can both inspire and lead his men with fairness and firmness, only occasionally resorting to the knout.MASTER AND COMMANDER is gorgeously done, the ships are authentically recreated, and the atmosphere of the film never thins. For anyone familiar with the history of seafaring conditions in those days, the film is somewhat sparse in showing us the true underside of life before the mast on board a late eighteenth century/early 19th century British man-o'-war: A stinking, dirty, dark, dank, impossibly cramped and crowded space most often painted red to hide the bloodstains from work wounds, war wounds, and fights. Compared to the reality, the 'Surprise' might as well be the 'Mauretania,' but beyond this lapse, the film is an honest portrayal. Sailors, be they professional, military, or recreational, will love it.Some reviewers have derided this film as being ""boring."" It is not. However, a drawback of making accurate films about the Age of Sail is that a jack tar's life in those years was defined by backbreaking, repetitive daily labor altogether adding up to long stretches of ennui, punctuated by short, incredibly violent and bloody exchanges with the enemy. To be an honest portrayal, a film cannot find its way around this central fact.Captain Aubrey and his crew and ship, including his friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a surgeon and naturalist, are attacked by the French battle ship 'Acheron.' After being trounced, Captain Aubrey becomes as obsessed as Melville's Ahab with hunting down the adversary, and takes his vessel around Cape Horn, into the Southern Ocean, the Pacific, and to the Galapagos Islands to meet battle.While at the Galapagos, Maturin discovers dozens of new species of life and formulates a theory regarding the origin of these species, but the demands of the service call the 'Surprise' away before he can collect specimens or coalesce his ideas, leaving it to Darwin to do so not many years later.As the film closes, the 'Surprise' continues on her war patrol, leaving the door open for a sequel.RECOMMENDED",4,"""The lesser of two weevils.""",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2338,"['MASTER', 'COMMANDER', 'FAR', 'SIDE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'master', 'commander', ""'HMS"", 'Surprise', 'war', 'patrol', 'first', 'worldwide', 'war', 'Napoleonic', 'era', '1805', 'Crowe', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Aubrey', 'intelligent', 'erudite', 'captain', 'who', 'can', 'inspire', 'lead', 'men', 'fairness', 'firmness', 'only', 'occasionally', 'resorting', 'knout.MASTER', 'AND', 'COMMANDER', 'gorgeously', 'done', 'ships', 'are', 'authentically', 'recreated', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'never', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'history', 'seafaring', 'conditions', 'days', 'film', 'somewhat', 'sparse', 'showing', 'true', 'underside', 'life', 'mast', 'board', 'late', 'eighteenth', 'century/early', '19th', 'century', 'British', ""man-o'-war"", 'stinking', 'dirty', 'dark', 'dank', 'impossibly', 'cramped', 'crowded', 'space', 'most', 'often', 'painted', 'red', 'hide', 'bloodstains', 'work', 'wounds', 'war', 'wounds', 'fights', 'Compared', 'reality', ""'Surprise"", 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', ""'Mauretania"", 'lapse', 'film', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Sailors', 'be', 'professional', 'military', 'recreational', 'will', 'love', 'it.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'derided', 'film', 'being', 'boring', 'not', 'However', 'drawback', 'making', 'accurate', 'films', 'Age', 'Sail', 'jack', 'tar', 'life', 'years', 'was', 'defined', 'backbreaking', 'repetitive', 'daily', 'labor', 'altogether', 'adding', 'up', 'long', 'stretches', 'ennui', 'punctuated', 'short', 'incredibly', 'violent', 'bloody', 'exchanges', 'enemy', 'be', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'central', 'fact.Captain', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'ship', 'including', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'surgeon', 'naturalist', 'are', 'attacked', 'French', 'battle', 'ship', ""'Acheron"", 'being', 'trounced', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'as', 'obsessed', 'Melville', 'Ahab', 'hunting', 'down', 'adversary', 'vessel', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'Southern', 'Ocean', 'Pacific', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'meet', 'battle.While', 'Galapagos', 'Maturin', 'dozens', 'new', 'species', 'life', 'theory', 'regarding', 'origin', 'species', 'demands', 'service', 'call', ""'Surprise"", 'away', 'can', 'collect', 'specimens', 'coalesce', 'ideas', 'leaving', 'Darwin', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'many', 'years', 'later.As', 'film', 'closes', ""'Surprise"", 'war', 'patrol', 'leaving', 'door', 'open', 'sequel.RECOMMENDED']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Russell Crowe plays Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, in one of his best performances of his career, Captain of HMS Surprise. Paul Bettany plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, Surgeon on the HMS Surprise, in the best performance of his career, so far. HMS Surprise is attacked in the beginning of the movie by the Acheron, a much stronger and faster battleship. Some of Aubrey's men were wounded and some of them died. As the movie progresses, we get to learn how the characters are feel and we feel the same exact thing that the characters because of the fact is that we know and get how they feel. Aubrey gets surprised twice by the captain of the Acheron and vows there will not be a third time. Men are lost in the balance of the attack and chase to find the Acheron. Men that were good people and fought for their country very well. At the end of this movie, they set a trap on the Acheron so they won't be the ones that are surprised and this trap does work brilliantly to Aubrey's advantage. This movie is set during the era of the French Revolution, and it is quite brilliant how Peter Weir and his crew made ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" come to life so brilliantly. The acting is superb as the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany's were. The directing by Peter Weir is brilliant and superb at its finest hour. The screenplay by Weir and John Conlee is excellent without compromise. The visual effects by INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC & ASYLUM is brilliant without compromise. The costume design is dynamic and brilliant. The production design is wonderful and brilliant. The film editing is great. The cinematography (Oscar Winner) is superb and dynamic without compromise. The music is brilliant and excellent. I like this movie very much, because it was brilliantly different from the movies we have seen this year, because it doesn't go for swashbuckling at all. The Acheron is the shark from ""Jaws"". It hides and it waits for its attack to happened.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[21, 23]","This is one of those big movies that I would've dearly loved to have made it to the theaters to see but never found the time which is a bit of a personal disappointment as this film, I'm sure, would've been even that much better on the silver screen.  While this great film has it's glorious battle scenes, it is a film based not so much in big action sequences but more in the intelligent dialogue and narrative.  Few films have so aptly displayed what a harsh life sailors of this particular era lived as well as this film does.  Youthful dreams of such a life may have been deftly squashed for many by seeing the harsh realities displayed in this film.  Simply put, this film is well paced with an apt balance between intense battle scenes and almost an almost poetic script.For many years now, Russell Crowe has displayed exceptional performances in several movies, showing that he has a wide range of acting abilities and this film is no exception to that as he brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life.  Paul Bettany's performance in this film is quite exceptional as well.  I believe the only other film I've seen him in was another Russell Crowe film in ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Clearly his future performances are to be looked forward to.  Another notable cast member is Billy Boyd, most well known for his role in ""The Lord of the Rings"" as Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took.  Although his role in this film is minor, he does stand out.Director Peter Weir has had a long and storied career directing in Hollywood with such notable films as ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Witness.""  This film will certainly go down in the history books as one of his best.The Premise:The fate of the British Empire seemingly rests on the shoulders of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he commands a British Naval warship that is suddenly attacked by a much larger French warship that he's been given the mission to capture or destroy.  After his first fateful encounter with the behemoth he must repair his ship and embarks on a trip spanning two oceans to capture or destroy the French ship or die in the trying...What follows from there is, as stated above, an extremely well made film that in its dialogue rings to a subtle but poignant tune and its action carries the weight of a big hitter.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:Strangely enough, the Special Features for this film seem to be somewhat of an afterthought and few at that.

748043,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008W64E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","I strongly suspect that those of us who have read the entire Aubrey-Maturin series are going to think more highly of &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; than those landlubbers who have not worked their way through the two sea faring yarns written by Patrick O'Brian.  That is because Peter Weir has effectively translated the original novel to the screen.  By &quot;original novel&quot; I mean &quot;The Far Side of the World,&quot; because that is clearly the basis for this film and not the first volume in the series, &quot;Master and Commander.&quot;  By &quot;effectively translated&quot; I fully take into account that the conflict is now between Jack Aubrey's H.M.S. Surprise and a French frigate during the Napoleonic War rather than with an American vessel during the War of 1812, that the entire subplot regarding Stephen Maturin's spy mission has been omitted, and that Stephen is suddenly a lot taller than Jack.  The attention here is to the spirit of the novels rather than the letter.  Given what Hollywood has so often done to beloved literary works, we are way ahead of the game with what we can only hope is the first in a series of films with these characters (at least until we get to my favorite scene in the series, when Jack is pilloried in &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;).The story of &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; essentially begins after the start and ends before the ending, which is not unusual in a Patrick O'Brian novel.  The Surprise is off of Brazil and we are privy to Aubrey's orders, which are to engage the French privateer Acheron and prevent the enemy vessel from sailing around Cape Horn and start raiding British whalers in the Pacific.  The only problem is that the French ship is not only bigger and faster but has more guns that shoot farther, while the volleys from Surprise bounce off the Acheron's sides.  The mismatch is proven in an initial engagement that is almost a complete disaster.  Discretion might demand the Surprise limp back to England for repairs, but &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack has his orders.  Jack insists it is the call of duty while Stephen dares to suggest it might be pride, but the result is the same.The result is that &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; is a chase film that runs over two hours (forget about looking at your watch and watch the movie).  The pursuer and the pursued change at critical times in the film, and there are uncomfortable lulls when sailors and surgeons can take deep breaths, all the while keeping an eye on the horizon to spot enemy sails.  But &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey will bide his time to prove the maximum about lucky being the residue of hard work, such as gunnery practice, and inspiration provided by his particular friend and a young midshipman.  My only serious complaint about the film has to do with the rampant jump cuts during the climactic battle, but still there are a couple of things you have never seen in a film about a naval engagement that are rather impressive when you realize that fact.Still, those of us who have read the O'Brian novels have the weather gage in this encounter, because the names of Killick, Padeen, Bonden, and Pullings all mean something to us and the richness of the supporting cast enhances the film even for the uninitiated.  Crowe effortlessly embodies Aubrey, and if O'Brian had lived to see this film he would not have regretted that this film was not made in in the previous century when his ideal choice for the role, Charlton Heston, could have essayed the role.  The choice of Paul Bettany will be the one that will trouble the purists, but it seems clear that Weir and co-writer John Collee wanted their Maturin to be more of a match for Aubrey.  To this end he is no longer oblivious of what is happening on the ship and apparently gets from ship to shore and back again without falling into the ocean.  Towards this same end there is a moment when readers of the novels expect Jack to dive into the ocean to save another able bodied seaman, but the film wants to make a very different point.  It might not be gospel, but it rings true in the moment, which is the greatest testament this film could pay to O'Brian and his readers.",5,Beat to Quarters.

748048,A383PPSVXNB0NB,B00008W64E,Leigh Fitzpatrick,"[3, 3]","This movie is pitch perfect in depicting a ship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic wars.  It is an exciting blend of action, acting, design, music, and pinpoint depictions of very complex characters.Even though most of the movie involves one ship chasing another halfway around the world, the movie never felt slow.  Every scene offered something compelling whether it was the interactions between Aubrey and the doctor, the subplot of the Jonah who is bringing bad luck to Lucky Jack's ship, how the crew responds to the death of a popular seaman, or realizing just how young the midshipmen (junior offices) were when they first went to sea.  The fact that these young boys were expected to lead grown men in battle was simply amazing.I also loved how the movie highlights just how rare this kind seafaring was and how awestruck the crew could be at sights such as the Galapagos Islands.  The West was on the cusp of great discoveries and visits like the Surprise's to the islands symbolizes the rapid gains that would soon be made.  The doctor's excitement and then let down about being allowed to explore the islands is one of the most poignant aspects of the movie.And then of course there are the battle scenes.  Any kind of warfare is awful and early 19th century naval warfare was particularly brutal with body parts being blown off by cannon fire, wood splinters skewering men, and musket fire raking the decks.  The Surprise is lucky to have a real doctor....most ships were stuck with barely educated saw bones who could do more harm than good.  The movie doesn't shy away from the violence of the times or the certain brutal joy that the men seemed to take on in combat.  Truly a different era.I highly recommend all aspects of this movie.

And every modern advanced filming technique as been used with perfection to bring it all to life.  It made the experience not just one of merely watching a film.  I felt I was actually on that ship  during the storms and the battles and the quiet times when there was no wind.  I got to know each of the characters and watched their complex personalities interact and develop in this small wooden world which was their life and their livelihood.Russell Crowe is the captain of the HMS Surprise.  He rules his ship with a tough minded decisiveness that earns him respect from his men.  Off the coast of Brazil, they are suddenly attacked by a French ship.  They manage to get away but know they will be attacked again.  Russell Crowe is determined to win -- so determined in fact that it made me think of Moby Dick and Captain Ahab's quest for the great white whale.  Cast in an equally important role is Paul Bettany.  He is the ship's doctor and we get to see him perform some medical marvels for his time.  Some of these scenes made me wince, especially one scene where he amputates the arm of young Max Pirkis, a 13-year old midshipman who immediately won my heart, especially as he manages to not only continue to perform his shipboard duties with one arm, he also absorbs the doctor's true passion for biology, and draws replicas of new plants and insects that they discover during their travels.There is more to this film that the technically masterful battles and storms.  There is also an unusually amount of intense detail of daily life on the ship as well as a great deal of character development.  The Captain and the doctor have a deep friendship, and even play duets on a violin and cello.  They are constantly engaged in philosophical discussions and there is often tension between them.  The doctor wants to spend time on the Galapagos Islands, studying the biological diversity of the terrain.  The captain, however, is obsessed with fighting the French ship.  How this all plays out shows each man's respect for each other.We also get to meet a whole cast of sailors on the ship and there are several interesting subplots which add reality to the film. I felt I was right there with them, sharing their life at sea.  Perhaps this was because I saw the film on a big screen in a theater.  But I suspect I'd love it just as much on a DVD and would probably watch all the special features about the challenge of filming it.  As far as I'm concerned this film has it all -- action, adventure, personal conflicts, questions of integrity and hard choices that have to be made.

748053,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B00008W64E,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[1, 3]","Yes, that's what this movie looked like at the outset. It's 1805--Trafalgar Year! When Master and Commander Russell Crowe is at dinner with his officers, one of them musters up the courage to ask him, ""Sir have you ever met the Admiral?"" We are then treated to Crowe's reverential view of Horatio Lord Nelson. Then, after a nasty battle, a young lad has had to have his arm amputated. M&C; Crowe visits the lad whilst recuperating. He is moved to see what's happened to this little tyke, and says something to the effect of, ""Well, here's something you can read in the meantime!"" and out comes a life story of Nelson. And, in case some in the audience are light on their Nelson lore, the first few pages of the book are turned to show Nelson with his empty sleeve pinned up--he's an amputee, just like Our Brave Lad. The Lad looks up at M&C; Crowe and puts it to him: ""What's he like, sir?"" Yet Our Man can give no answer, but just moves away.Well, having been prepared with these Nelsonic emblems, I thought I could predict a thing or two about this movie. The mission of the ship is to track down a French vessel in the Western Hemisphere and stop/sink her. But just a few minutes into the flick comes that sea battle mentioned above that seriously cripples M&C;'s ship. Everyone's for going back to refit, except--most importantly of course--M&C.; He says, I've got my orders and that's it. I, TutorGal, then waited to hear him express WHY this had to be, because of all the Nelson stuff earlier. I mean, it just hung there in the air waiting to be verbalized: BECAUSE ENGLAND EXPECTS THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD DO HIS DUTY. Those are the most famous words of Lord Nelson, you see. Interestingly enough, though, not a peep about this. Now of course, one could argue that the saying comes from the Battle of Trafalgar, which hadn't happened yet in this movie, and you'd be right. But couldn't M&C; have said, since he seems really into Nelson, something like, ""Every time I ever heard him, he commented on how important it was to do your duty."" Not the real famous quote, but something that would suggest that Nelson communicated how essential he found this value to the young M&C.;I also have since learned that this movie is based on a rather well-known and loved book series. This explains something which had baffled me during the movie, precisely: why was I supposed to be into the ship's doctor's scene? He and M&C; are always exchanging ""meaningful glances"" which if you hadn't read these books (like me) you might interpret as ""these guys have something going on the side"". Actually, it's that they are the best of friends--soulmates but just of the same gender. But herein also must have been a disappointment for those who had come to the theatre because of having loved the books. At one point, M&C; is trying to figure out how come these French guys are always able to psych out the English ship's position. Doctor replies, The French navy has their spies, as do we. Then, another of those ""glances"". What was that about? Even if you were a spy on the English ship, well, what were you going to do with this purloined information--toss it overboard in a bottle? But evidentally, the ship's doctor--in the books--is himself a spy, of all things. But since nothing else was made of this, it was a line that was just there as a table scrap to book readers.After a while, Sea Literature 101 starts to loom on the horizon. There's some junior officer who always seems to have bad luck on his watch and others begin to grumble that he's...Jonah! Uh oh, know what you have to do with a Jonah, don't you? Then remember, M&C; won't listen to reason about turning back. Doctor tried to get through to him. He seems as obsessed as if he were hunting down...a white whale! Well, metaphorically at least. And then, of all things, what starts flying around just above the deck? Did you guess it already? Did you? An...albatross! And some stupid guy gets out a gun and then...calamity!!! Which leads to the most outlandish operation scene I've ever seen in any movie, period. I don't want to spoil it entirely, but let's just say there are some things you just can't do yourself, and abdominal surgery is one of them.Now, lest you think that this movie ought to be beached, not the case at all!! Actually, it has a lot going for it. Russell Crowe makes for a nice captain--none of that Bligh stuff on this boat. The little kid is quite scrappy and likeable, as are most of the crew. There is a sense of real exhilaration when M&C; puts his boot up on the side of his ship and sails along with his ponytail in the wind. And when there's a battle scene, they go for it! So I liked this movie in spite of my scribblings above.It's a good movie in many respects, but it just seems to be lacking something, which is I expect something from the books themselves.

748054,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B00008W64E,L. J Nary,"[0, 1]","This movie really reflects navel life at sea. The way it was filmed and acted was so real life and believable. The words that were filled with sea tanged royal marine life, felt as if you were beside the men manning the deck, paving the way for a battle upon the high waves of the ocean, near some mysterious tropical island or remote tossing about like a toy on a world of water. The movie fills the screen with two excellent actors, one is Russell Crowe and the other his name forgotten, yet his skill in the performing arts shines. The movie reflects the camaraderie of the men and their well founded esteem for the capitan and the doctor. There are men of all ages, the youngest being pre-teen. They all are excited to be serving the crown, fighting against the French fleet. The movie is about the cat and mouse pursuit between the Surprise manned by the Brits and the Avature bespoken by the French. Russells ship or Captain Jack's ship is not as well made as the stronger faster rival. The movie shows the chase and their strategies in finally meeting and fighting for the prize. The images in the film are so beautiful with color and the desire to be in that moment. A sumpetious feast of symbolic brilliance. The crashing waves filled with dark mystery. The bounty floating below the wooden rails, ships brimming with perfumed fruit and lovely native men and women selling their wares. I loved the scene where the men share their dinner, young and old with anectadotes of their travels and meetings with important others. The crystal and the silver, the meals prepared by the grouchy cook. The nautical equipment was visually attractive to look at and creating imaginings of yourself in that experience. The music and the friendship displayed by Stephen the doctor and the captain. Their respect for one another, tested by the lessons of life. I especially liked the expeditions journied by the doctor learning about faraway lands and animals that had not been logged in books. His drawings and his discoveries plus his knowledge at doctoring patients, crusty with salt and young with beads of sweat. The sweltering heat when the sails sat still as did the ship upon the smoothed over wrinkles of the deep blue. The grand adventures that came from their voyages, like the Gallpagos Islands fed my yearnings for faraway places.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[1, 2]","Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an all-male, testosterone-fueled, seafaring adventure about a British naval captain who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a faster, more advanced French warship.  The time of the film is 1805, when Napoleon was seeking to conquer Europe, and England had declared war.  The film is based on the historical fiction novels of the same title by Patrick O'Brian.Russel Crowe heads an excellent cast as Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Jack Aubrey, a hard-headed, disciplined military man bent on capturing the Archeron at all costs.  Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's opposite, a gentle, intellectual doctor who is ship surgeon and naturalist.  Maturin and Aubrey are constantly butting heads, making M & C kind of a high-seas buddy pic.The story is tightly paced and the music score is low-key.  It is music you might expect to hear watching a chess match, rather than swelling orchestral strains one expects during these types of historical pictures.  But indeed, the deadly stalking of the two ships is very much like a chess game.I loved this exciting, old-fashioned movie.The film is available to watch in Spanish and French dubs and subs.Unless you have a remote on whatever machine you are watching this DVD on, you cannot access special features.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","Given the number of excellent movies that have been made about sailing ships and the breadth of coverage of those movies, at first you might wonder how yet another movie is going to add anything to the genre. If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question. This story is as compelling as ""Moby Dick,"" and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains. However, it cannot be, for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents. In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy. Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good. The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous. Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book ""Two Years Before the Mast."" While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed. We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own. We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different.Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery. In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool. In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in ""Jurassic Park,"" you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics. While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast. ""Master and Commander"" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but ""The Return of the King"" overshadowed this superb historical fiction. It is gratifying to see such quality in film making. This movie is well worth five stars and then some.Enjoy!",5,Authentic Swashbuckler,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,3100,"['Given', 'number', 'excellent', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'sailing', 'ships', 'breadth', 'coverage', 'movies', 'first', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'yet', 'movie', 'going', 'add', 'anything', 'genre', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'need', 'answer', 'question', 'story', 'as', 'compelling', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'captain', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'just', 'as', 'driven', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'though', 'generally', 'not', 'mad', 'was', 'Ahab.The', 'story', 'first', 'be', 'classic', 'story', 'strategic', 'sea', 'chase', 'two', 'captains', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pursuer', 'pursued', 'frequently', 'change', 'position', 'English', 'pursuer', 'weaker', 'two', 'opponents', 'order', 'have', 'chance', 'enemy', 'longer', 'range', 'guns', 'more', 'speed', 'nearly', 'impenetrable', 'hull', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'will', 'need', 'luck', 'bravery', 'superb', 'strategy', 'Fortunately', 'three', 'will', 'eventually', 'work', 'favor', 'least', 'sufficiently', 'make', 'grand', 'finish', 'movie.Three', 'things', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'predecessors.First', 'detail', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'good', 'research', 'conditions', 'sailing', 'ship', 'era', 'was', 'apparently', 'quite', 'extensive', 'details', 'operation', 'ship', 'were', 'numerous', 'Details', 'regarding', 'relationships', 'officers', 'crew', 'also', 'appeared', 'quite', 'authentic', 'recalling', 'dim', 'book', 'Two', 'Years', 'Mast', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'attention', 'detail', 'very', 'detail', 'much', 'movie', 'delight', 'watch.Secondly', 'two', 'captains', 'were', 'bit', 'as', 'crafty', 'two', 'captains', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'portrayed', 'only', 'see', 'results', 'French', 'captain', 'efforts', 'see', 'result', 'efforts', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'realize', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'met', 'someone', 'talent', 'least', 'equal', 'own', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'scenarios', 'movies', 'such', 'Enemy', 'Below', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'yet', 'one', 'movies', 'scenario', 'similar', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'will', 'find', 'course', 'movie', 'ending', 'be', 'different.Third', 'special', 'effects', 'benefit', 'decades', 'development', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'movies', 'days', 'gone', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'rely', 'heavily', 'miniature', 'ships', 'floating', 'about', 'big', 'pool', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'ship', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'can', 'guess', 'computer', 'images', 'were', 'used', 'try', 'not', 'focus', 'aspect', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'distract', 'story.Russell', 'Crowe', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'well', 'supported', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Master', 'Commander', 'received', 'ten', 'nominations', 'Academy', 'Awards', '2003', 'other', 'year', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'won', 'many', 'more', 'awards', 'two', 'won', 'Return', 'King', 'overshadowed', 'superb', 'historical', 'fiction', 'gratifying', 'see', 'such', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'then', 'some.Enjoy']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Crowe is ideally cast and Bettnay proves to be an able support. Rest of the cast was quite historical as there were blacks aboard these ships. Using kids as midshipmen were also very accurate as most midshipmen were 12-14 years old boys. I think the real key elements of this movie was that it very historically accurate. The shipboard life, handling of the ship and all that was done superbly well. The movie basically centered around Crowe's character and how he affects those around him. In this, its a fantastic effort by Crowe and its very reflective on the screen. But this is a ""man's movie"" and not a date film in my opinion. There are no sex scene, no romantic scene and no pretty woman outside of that brief moment during resupply. There are a lot of character building, bloody combat and interpersonal conflicts. Because it is historically correct, many people whose knowledge of history is rather limited, might find some part of this movie rather confusing and its lingo, very foreign like. But its a great movie and don't make the mistake of one mother and her three kids who thought this was some sort of Pirates of the Carribean type of movie.For the history interested crowd....in April 1805 when the movie start, Napoleon was master of only France and her immediate territory.

I have not read the Jack Aubrey books on which this movie is based, but I love this movie.  It has so much to commend it.  There are amazing battle sequences, a storm scene that has me checking my living room floor for overflow water, great sadness, great excitement and a host of memorable characters.  Among this host are not only the captain and the ship's doctor, but also the very young midshipman who loses an arm early on in the film, yet surmounts his disability with great dignity and pluck, the older midshipman paralyzed by his own fears, which end up costing two lives, and the ever grumbling Killick, Aubrey's servant, whose running commentary provides some comic relief.  Add to that a great score, full of classical music, and fabulous photography and special effects (especially the effects of canon fire at night and in fog) and what's not to love!In addition to the action scenes and blood and guts, the film explores quiet moments of ship life, from the opening scenes of the sleeping crew, through scenes of the doctor and captain playing string duets to the doctor engaged in his scientific pursuits both on the ship and on the Galapagos Islands.  There is a wealth of detail about shipboard life in the Georgian navy and of the organization of its personnel.The interpersonal conflicts and interactions are believable and memorable.  But probably the most impressive thing about the movie is the study it presents in the choices that may confront a leader in wartime.  From the light-hearted ""lesser of two weevils"" moment we are led through several episodes that illustrate the brutal truth that lies behind the joke.  In war the leader must often choose the lesser of two evils:  to sacrifice one life to save the other 196, to punish insubordination even when you don't want to do it for the sake of ship discipline, to sacrifice one's mission in order to possibly save the life of the ship's surgeon who is also your friend.

That is to say it combines both of these depictions of war, never truly making one or the other seem the way it was. And I believe that that is what it would actually boil down to; a combination of the physical and emotional scars of war as well as the admiration of men of courage.The story takes place in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is in command of the H.M.S. Surprise with instructions to ferret out the Acheron, a French ship that has been wreaking havoc off the coast of South America. With a hardy crew and a combination of battle scarred and fresh faced officers, they set out to do the task they were assigned.But rather than wait till half way through the film to have these two adversaries confront one another, the film nearly opens with a full blown sea battle. But this one is unlike most offered in films from the past. The glowing heroics of jumping from ship to ship, the always missing cannonballs, the smiling faces are replaced with a more realistic atmosphere.The Surprise is caught off guard and pelted with cannon fire, ripping the ship apart. The battle is not so much fought using guns and swords as it is using tactics and maneuvering. A combination of these two (as well as the fog bank from which the Acheron was able to launch its attack) and the ship and crew are saved. Broken but not yet destroyed, Aubrey and his crew set out to find the Acheron while making repairs as they go.With this adrenaline rush completed for the viewer, we are now offered a glimpse into the real life that was found at sea. The daily routine of making sure the ship was taken care of, the talking between the ships crew that eventually leads to the death of one of the officers, the camaraderie of the crew who would follow their captain to hell and back and yet would never consider sharing more than a cursory glance at the officers. These were two separate classes brought together for a common cause, but that never made them friends.And yet when a kind word or situation presents itself, it is offered. The deeds and misdeeds of those on board bring about a closeness between this group and they rise to the task before them.Not only does this story present itself (more in visual deed than in word), the observations of the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) towards his friend and commander are seen. The pair shares an interest in classical musicianship and an interest in the crew. But while Aubrey feels the need for battle and to rid the seas of his countries enemy, Maturin takes the more intellectual approach, voicing his opinion that rest is needed, that time should be taken rather than pursue the Acheron. Some might see this as a metaphor for the recent battles in Congress over the war in Iraq. That could be said. But I saw this more as the question that all men ask before launching into war. And the answers are never simple nor easily made.There is an underlying complexity to the character of Aubrey that Crowe brings forth. While he longs to face his enemy and to win, he also cares deeply for his ship and for its crew. His desire to win may cause him to make a wrong decision now and then, but deep down he would never put his men in the face of danger if he were not convinced he could save them.A final face off is inevitable but to reveal who wins would not only be a tremendous spoiler but would take away the effect it has on the viewer. Suffice to say that the movie truly never quite has an ending. But in a good way, not a ""here we go again"" one.The movie depicts the life of a sailor in these times in more realistic fashion than any movie I've seen before. While we are usually given old sea faring gents, this one shows us a combination of men who have no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure. The range of ages was exactly that in those days.While a single hole in a ship meant a fast sinking vessel in most movies, this one shows that repairs could be and were made. The ships were not that easy to down. But it also allows us to see the damage caused by the cannonballs that slammed hard into the ship, inflicting more human damage than they could to the ship.While a sobering look at sea warfare, the movie also has its lighter moments. It also offers a testament to the human spirit as well. But most importantly it offers us something sorely lacking in today's world, something that has bothered me tremendously. It offers us a hero. A steadfast man capable of making mistakes but owning up to them and then rallying his troops to face off against a common enemy. The world lacks heroes these days. Perhaps we will only find them in film. But at least a new generation will have the chance to have that hero.",4,DUTY...HONOR...BATTLE,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,4949,"['most', 'movies', 'depicting', 'rigors', 'war', 'battle', 'days', 'focus', 'glory', 'heroism', 'gore', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'MASTER', 'AND', 'COMMANDER', 'instead', 'more', 'realistic', 'aspect', 'say', 'depictions', 'war', 'never', 'truly', 'making', 'one', 'other', 'seem', 'way', 'was', 'believe', 'what', 'would', 'actually', 'boil', 'down', 'combination', 'physical', 'emotional', 'scars', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'admiration', 'men', 'courage.The', 'story', 'place', '1805', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'command', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'instructions', 'ferret', 'out', 'Acheron', 'French', 'ship', 'been', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'coast', 'South', 'America', 'hardy', 'crew', 'combination', 'battle', 'scarred', 'fresh', 'faced', 'officers', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'task', 'were', 'assigned.But', 'rather', 'wait', 'till', 'way', 'film', 'have', 'two', 'adversaries', 'confront', 'one', 'film', 'nearly', 'full', 'blown', 'sea', 'battle', 'one', 'most', 'offered', 'films', 'past', 'glowing', 'heroics', 'jumping', 'ship', 'ship', 'always', 'missing', 'cannonballs', 'smiling', 'are', 'replaced', 'more', 'realistic', 'atmosphere.The', 'Surprise', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'pelted', 'cannon', 'fire', 'ripping', 'ship', 'apart', 'battle', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fought', 'using', 'guns', 'swords', 'using', 'tactics', 'maneuvering', 'combination', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'fog', 'bank', 'Acheron', 'was', 'able', 'launch', 'attack', 'ship', 'crew', 'are', 'saved', 'Broken', 'not', 'yet', 'destroyed', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'Acheron', 'making', 'repairs', 'go.With', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'completed', 'viewer', 'are', 'now', 'offered', 'glimpse', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'found', 'sea', 'daily', 'routine', 'making', 'sure', 'ship', 'was', 'taken', 'care', 'talking', 'ships', 'crew', 'eventually', 'death', 'one', 'officers', 'camaraderie', 'crew', 'who', 'would', 'follow', 'captain', 'hell', 'back', 'yet', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'sharing', 'more', 'cursory', 'glance', 'officers', 'were', 'two', 'separate', 'classes', 'brought', 'together', 'common', 'cause', 'never', 'made', 'friends.And', 'yet', 'when', 'kind', 'word', 'situation', 'presents', 'offered', 'deeds', 'misdeeds', 'board', 'bring', 'closeness', 'group', 'rise', 'task', 'them.Not', 'only', 'story', 'present', 'more', 'visual', 'deed', 'word', 'observations', 'ship', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'friend', 'commander', 'are', 'seen', 'pair', 'shares', 'interest', 'classical', 'musicianship', 'interest', 'crew', 'Aubrey', 'need', 'battle', 'rid', 'seas', 'countries', 'enemy', 'Maturin', 'more', 'intellectual', 'approach', 'voicing', 'opinion', 'rest', 'needed', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'rather', 'pursue', 'Acheron', 'might', 'see', 'metaphor', 'recent', 'battles', 'Congress', 'war', 'Iraq', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'saw', 'more', 'question', 'men', 'ask', 'launching', 'war', 'answers', 'are', 'never', 'simple', 'easily', 'underlying', 'complexity', 'character', 'Aubrey', 'Crowe', 'forth', 'face', 'enemy', 'win', 'also', 'deeply', 'ship', 'crew', 'desire', 'win', 'may', 'cause', 'make', 'wrong', 'decision', 'now', 'then', 'deep', 'would', 'never', 'put', 'men', 'face', 'danger', 'were', 'not', 'convinced', 'could', 'save', 'them.A', 'final', 'face', 'off', 'inevitable', 'reveal', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'tremendous', 'spoiler', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'effect', 'viewer', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'truly', 'never', 'quite', 'ending', 'good', 'way', 'not', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'one.The', 'movie', 'life', 'sailor', 'times', 'more', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'usually', 'given', 'old', 'sea', 'faring', 'gents', 'one', 'combination', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'mingling', 'young', 'lads', 'who', 'long', 'adventure', 'range', 'ages', 'was', 'exactly', 'single', 'hole', 'ship', 'meant', 'fast', 'sinking', 'vessel', 'most', 'movies', 'one', 'repairs', 'could', 'be', 'were', 'made', 'ships', 'were', 'not', 'easy', 'down', 'also', 'see', 'damage', 'caused', 'cannonballs', 'slammed', 'hard', 'ship', 'inflicting', 'more', 'human', 'damage', 'could', 'ship.While', 'sobering', 'look', 'sea', 'warfare', 'movie', 'also', 'lighter', 'moments', 'also', 'testament', 'human', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'importantly', 'something', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'today', 'world', 'something', 'bothered', 'tremendously', 'hero', 'steadfast', 'man', 'capable', 'making', 'mistakes', 'owning', 'up', 'then', 'rallying', 'troops', 'face', 'off', 'common', 'enemy', 'world', 'heroes', 'days', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'only', 'find', 'film', 'least', 'new', 'generation', 'will', 'have', 'chance', 'have', 'hero']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

I had forgotten all about it and did not remember whether it had good reviews upon release, but I picked it up at the video store to rent on a whim. We both enjoy English history, sailing and Russell Crowe so I thought it would be worth $4 to give it a look. What a perfect movie night we had.The film is visually breathtaking. The attention to every detail of costume and set design is remarkable. You really do feel as though you were on an early 19th century war ship, creaky, leaky and rum-soaked in the bowels but erudite and elegant in the captain's quarters. Unlike many special effects extravaganzas and costume dramas, this is not a poor-to-mediocre film in a fancy package. The script is witty, the character development is effective, the pacing brisk, and the acting from Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany and the supporting cast reliably excellent. It is fascinating to watch how the ship works. It's really a microcosm of British society at the beginning of its great 19th century imperial expansion (albeit without women), with its class distinctions and power structures. Crowe's character, the ship's captain, represents pragmatic, confident leadership and the conviction that Britain knows what should be done and shall make sure it gets done. Paul Bettany's character, the ship's physician, represents the intellectual curiosity that led to the industrial revolution and the theory of evolution. The battle scenes are engrossing, and with a few exceptions, I don't really care for war movies.Although it's rated PG-13 and some scenes are probably too intense for young children (especially the scene where a child sailor has his arm amputated without benefit of anesthesia), I really did not see anything objectionable for any age group.I'm off to order DVDs for my husband for our anniversary and for my father-in-law for Father's Day.

Actually, the facts are not all that important to director Peter Weir as are the sights and sounds of this film.  Capt. Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is about the most likable and mild-mannered sea-faring Captain since Captain Kangaroo; a casting mistake if ever there was one.  The ship's more level headed doctor (Paul Bettany) seems more like an early nineteenth century character dealing with tragedy on a daily basis.  The plot is terribly simple with battle after battle with buddy bonding scenes around the dinner table spliced in between.  The only original highlights are the Galapagos scenes.  However, one must give high points to Weir for his realistic battles, ships and special effects.  The sounds are inspiring and everything looks and sounds true.  In fact, the effects are the true stars of this film.  I can't say I would recommend purchasing this DVD, but a viewing on a boring Sunday afternoon would do it justice.  There are some standard trailers and the widescreen format can't be beat with any epic story.  2 stars for story and 4 stars for visuals and sound seem fair.",3,Sort of a Master and Commander,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1234,"['Fans', 'author', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'miffed', 'plot', 'change', 'British/American', 'skirmish', '1812', 'British/French', '1805', 'Actually', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'are', 'sights', 'sounds', 'film', 'Capt', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'most', 'likable', 'mild-mannered', 'sea-faring', 'Captain', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'casting', 'mistake', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'ship', 'more', 'level', 'headed', 'doctor', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'more', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'character', 'dealing', 'tragedy', 'daily', 'basis', 'plot', 'terribly', 'simple', 'battle', 'battle', 'buddy', 'bonding', 'scenes', 'dinner', 'table', 'spliced', 'only', 'original', 'highlights', 'are', 'Galapagos', 'scenes', 'However', 'must', 'give', 'high', 'points', 'Weir', 'realistic', 'battles', 'ships', 'special', 'effects', 'sounds', 'are', 'inspiring', 'everything', 'looks', 'true', 'fact', 'effects', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'boring', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'would', 'do', 'justice', 'are', 'standard', 'trailers', 'widescreen', 'format', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'epic', 'story', '2', 'stars', 'story', '4', 'stars', 'visuals', 'sound', 'seem', 'fair']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748071,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00008W64E,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","Fans of Russell Crowe will love his newest film, MASTER AND COMMANDER.  Crowe continues his tradition of playing strong-minded characters in his role of Captain Jack Aubrey, the commander of Her Majesty's Ship, The Surprise, during the English-French war of 1805.  What director Peter Weir brings to the screen is an exciting and as astonishing a sea adventure saga that combines the best of the Horation Hornblower series with Captain Kirk from STAR TREK.  Weir captures the essence of what it must have been like to be a sailor of that time.  Part of the believability lies in Weir's portrayal of the natural elements of shipboard life: the cold, the hunger, the salt spray, the lack of women.  But what makes this film click is a series of subtexts that explores the infinitely illogical relationship between duty and frienship.  Serving as ship's doctor is Lieutenant Stephen Maturin (Peter Bettany, who played Crowe's non-existent roommate from A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  Maturin is more than just the rather youngish ship's surgeon.  He is a naturalist one generation before Darwin.  He longs to explore the unknown flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands.  Several times, Captain Aubrey promises him the opportunity to do so but each time the exigencies of war force him to do otherwise.  This clashing of wills is only but the most obvious of themes that elevate MASTER AND COMMANDER to a superior sea war film.  Director Weir further examines the delicate balancing act that any commanding officer faces when deciding just how close that officer can allow himself to be towards his crew.The plot is straightforward and uncomplicated.  Aubrey is ordered to seek out and destroy the Acheron, a vessel that is much faster and more heavily armed than Aubrey's.  During this chase, each ship takes turns chasing the other, with the ultimate confrontation resulting in a roaringly load sea battle that seems as exciting as it was undoubtedly authentic.  There is more than a few passing references to Star Trek, especially the episode where Kirk disguises himself as a Romulan to defeat a vessel of superior technology.  MASTER AND COMMANDER seems sure to garner a few Oscars, probably for Best Picture and Best Actor.

748072,A1UB187HB0RKAM,B00008W64E,M. A. Treu,"[6, 9]","-The film, Master and Commander, based on the novels of Patrick O'Brian, speaks to the pinnacle achievements of European culture. What a great pity that the world is now suffocated by a poisoned atmosphere of jealousy and hate directed against Caucasian Europeans, such that many proud inheritors of their singular Western Culture are afraid to speak its name, or to herald its praises directly and without apology or explanation. The creators of this film have pushed at the envelope of containment that surrounds every possible celebratory depiction applauding Europeans, or the achievements of Western Culture and Christian-based societies. However, despite the courage of the director, co-screen writer, and co-producer: Peter Weir, and despite the fact that this work is bolder and more honest than other products coming from the entertainment industry, not everything here is boldly spoken. There is a great deal to be absorbed by analyzing the symbolism and the metaphoric content of this film-a great deal of the message is delivered in metaphor, and with the music.The overall musical presentations of this film are very impressive, and the CD of the musical score is far from a disappointment. The skillfully repetitious use of percussion instruments throughout the film successfully recreates the sound of a thumping on the ship's hull: a sound that chills the heart of every sailor and alerts him to danger. The blood, the bravery, the glories of battle, as well as the continued yearning to acquire knowledge and  explore the unknown, are punctuated by the music of Mozart, Corelli, Bach, and Boccherini, each of whom is the product of a refined, highly developed  European culture, represented here by one French and one British warship on the untamed, empty sea.Russell Crowe, as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey of H.M.S. Surprise, and Paul Bettany, as the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin-reunited after their fine performances in A Beautiful Mind-symbolize the intricate structure, the delicate balance, the intellectual and artistic achievements, and even the fragility of European civilization, as their characters perform in the great-cabin of a 19th Century warship, some of the most beautiful and sophisticated classical music ever written. Also a product of European culture is the clever, unseen captain of the French frigate Acheron, who hounds and bedevils Aubrey-on the far side of the world- as this remarkable film reveals the story of a conflict between two European empires played out on the bloody decks of two warships, in the era of Napoleon I.The action, for the most part, takes place aboard H.M.S. Surprise, amid a plethora of subtle contrasts skillfully woven into the structure of the story.  These contrasts define the men, their race, and their culture: science vs. superstition, boldness vs. complacency order vs. disruption, leadership vs. permissiveness, intelligent adaptation vs. extinction.The choices made by the ships company and how they act and react, in the face of these contrasts, makes a statement about who they are and what they represent.Captain Aubrey reminds his crew to always stand tall and uphold their beliefs and their people, for wherever their small ship sails it represents England. Again and again, the cameras show a small ship in a vast expanse of ocean, floating into an uncertain future under a darkening sky. An excellent metaphor pointing to the uncertain future of White Europeans and Western Culture, which are already under relentless attack from the socialist remnants of collapsed Communism, and from ""politically correct"" historical revisionism striving to diminish or remove any reference to heroic Caucasian males, like Captain Jack Aubrey.The original score's musical reverberations suggest a beating against the hull, rather than the sound of cannons shooting-there is no sharp ""crack"" as might be expected with the sound of gunfire. This simplicity of deep aboriginal-like drumming is a counterpoint to the sweet complexity of the classical compositions punctuating the story, which at first appears to address only the interactions of two ships. It is only upon closer analysis that the racial and cultural aspects become apparent. The real threat to England and H.M.S. Surprise is not from France, a fellow European nation, or from France's warship Acheron; the threat is from that percussive thumping on the hulls of both ships, as if something on the outside wanted to get inside-inside the warships and inside the ships-of-state represented by Surprise and Acheron.The several all too brief glimpses into the great-cabin of Surprise, where Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin play on violin and cello respectively-while outside the endless, untamed sea stretches to infinity-are among the most moving I have seen. The most compelling is when Surprise is sailing slowly ahead, and the camera angle is from outside the great-cabin looking in through the wide-open stern windows, as though the viewer were seeing through the eyes of a skulking enemy, or the sea itself. The ship, and the heroes, and the music are warm and candle-lit inside, but the wild sea, the unknown future, and unknown dangers are watching from close behind-a powerful suggestion of man's Darwinian struggle for survival, for procreation, for adventure, and sometimes for fun.The classical music is used as a skillful surgeon uses a scalpel, to separate the light from the dark, to define the good and the glory, to contrast hope from hopelessness, and to inspire today's sons and daughters of men like ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey and his disciplined, faithful crew to look around them and prepare to fight off, yet again, threats to their future, their culture and their people. As the sweet music fills the cabin and drifts away, the small ship sails alone on an endless sea-above all, there is the music.If, indeed, all art aspires to the condition of music, then the miraculous melodies in this film represents the culmination of two thousand, and more, years of unequaled European cultural achievements.

748073,A13TO1ZFAH9SVN,B00008W64E,Matthew Edmundson,"[1, 1]","Master and Commander-The Far Side of the World is a fantastic movie in so many ways. There are so many things that make it great and the flaws are few.In Master and Commander we have Captian ""Lucky Jack Aubrey. He has been given orders by the British empire to take down the French privateer Acheron. After a sneak attack by the French it's up to Jack to strike back. The ship needs repair and morale is low. He will also find himself torn between duty and friendship as he tries to fulfill his commands and stay true to himself.Russel Crowe is the man. He is easily one of the greatest actors still in the business today. He plays Jack Aubrey to perfection. Russel Crowe lives the part and becomes the character and he does that in this movie. He is simply amazing and I love watching this guy on the big screen. In almost any other year Crowe probaly would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this performance. It is that good.Paul Bettany is great as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He displays human emotions very well. It's a great character and he plays it very well. Like Crowe his performance is good enough for an academy nomination and in almost any other year and he would have gotten one.Peter Weir has directed a cinematic masterpiece. Not since Steven Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan has a war movie had such detail put into it. Everything looks great in the film. The sets are real and authenic. The costumes are great. All the little details are great. They used real ships and filmed this in the tank that was made for Titanic. Mad props have to be given to Weir for the dedication and work he put into the film.The one flaw that can be said about the movie is it is slow in places. The friendship between Aubrey and the Doctor does drag in places and they did go a little far with some of the character development. We don't need to learn as much as we did with some of the side characters. They don't do really do anything to enhance the plot of the movie at all.One problem this movie had was the success of Pirates of the Carribean. Far to many people went to this film expecting to see something like  that. Instead of a comedy you get a pretty serious war-action-drama movie. The comedic points are low and most of them are based out of irony. Far to many people expected Pirates and knocked the film because of it.The film was nominated for 10 academy awards. The two big ones were nominatons for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director."" It won for Best Sound and Best Cinematograpy. It's a pretty big statement when a movie gets this much academy attention. It would have won more if it hadn't been for Return of the King.This is a great film. It's slow in places but is well worth it. It's a beautiful made movie and I'm glad I own it. It's enjoyable and I recommend it to all.",4,A Great Made Movie,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,2788,"['Master', 'Commander-The', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'great', 'flaws', 'are', 'few.In', 'Master', 'Commander', 'have', 'Captian', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'been', 'given', 'orders', 'British', 'empire', 'take', 'down', 'French', 'privateer', 'Acheron', 'sneak', 'attack', 'French', 'up', 'Jack', 'strike', 'back', 'ship', 'repair', 'morale', 'low', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'torn', 'duty', 'friendship', 'fulfill', 'commands', 'stay', 'true', 'himself.Russel', 'Crowe', 'man', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'still', 'business', 'today', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'perfection', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'part', 'character', 'movie', 'simply', 'amazing', 'love', 'watching', 'guy', 'big', 'screen', 'almost', 'other', 'year', 'Crowe', 'probaly', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'good.Paul', 'Bettany', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'human', 'emotions', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'good', 'enough', 'academy', 'nomination', 'almost', 'other', 'year', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'one.Peter', 'Weir', 'directed', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Not', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'war', 'movie', 'had', 'such', 'detail', 'put', 'Everything', 'great', 'film', 'sets', 'are', 'real', 'authenic', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'great', 'used', 'real', 'ships', 'filmed', 'tank', 'was', 'made', 'Titanic', 'Mad', 'props', 'have', 'be', 'given', 'Weir', 'dedication', 'work', 'put', 'film.The', 'one', 'flaw', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'slow', 'places', 'friendship', 'Aubrey', 'Doctor', 'drag', 'places', 'did', 'go', 'little', 'far', 'character', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'side', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'enhance', 'plot', 'movie', 'all.One', 'problem', 'movie', 'had', 'was', 'success', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'Far', 'many', 'people', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'something', 'Instead', 'comedy', 'get', 'pretty', 'serious', 'war-action-drama', 'movie', 'comedic', 'points', 'are', 'low', 'most', 'are', 'based', 'irony', 'Far', 'many', 'people', 'expected', 'Pirates', 'knocked', 'film', 'it.The', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '10', 'academy', 'awards', 'two', 'big', 'ones', 'were', 'nominatons', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'won', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Best', 'Cinematograpy', 'pretty', 'big', 'statement', 'when', 'movie', 'much', 'academy', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'more', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Return', 'King.This', 'great', 'film', 'slow', 'places', 'well', 'worth', 'beautiful', 'made', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'enjoyable', 'recommend']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748074,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00008W64E,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is probably the best movie ever made about life aboard an early 19th Century naval vessel. There is an epic storytelling quality here that is reminiscent of  classics like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". It also has a grace and elegance not often seen in movies - epic or otherwise - these days.Ironically, all these fine qualities may have limited its commercial appeal. The bulk is the movie is about the two main characters - Capt. Jack Aubrey [Russell Crowe] and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin [Paul Bettany] and their relationship with each other and with the rest of the crew. There are only two major battles scenes, which, while impressive, run only a few minutes each.Capt. Aubrey is commander of the Surprise, a rather small and outdated British vessel. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and England is in danger of invasion by the French. Aubrey and crew are off the coast of Brazil, where they spot a very fast and modern French ship. Aubrey decides to pursue it, and the chase takes him all the way around the tip of South America to the Galapolos Islands off the coast of Chile. There, the final confrontation between the two vessels takes place.Crowe and Bettany are superb as two friends whose differences make them perfect counterpoints. To those who are more into narrative than action, watching these two play off each other is the highlight of the movie.""Master and Commander"" is marvelous entertainment and quite possibly the best big studio movie of 2003.",5,An outstanding movie acheivement,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,1566,"['Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'life', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'naval', 'vessel', 'epic', 'storytelling', 'quality', 'here', 'reminiscent', 'classics', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'also', 'grace', 'elegance', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'movies', 'epic', 'otherwise', 'days.Ironically', 'fine', 'qualities', 'may', 'have', 'limited', 'commercial', 'appeal', 'bulk', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', '[', 'Russell', 'Crowe', ']', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', '[', 'Paul', 'Bettany', ']', 'relationship', 'other', 'rest', 'crew', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'major', 'battles', 'scenes', 'impressive', 'run', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'each.Capt', 'Aubrey', 'commander', 'Surprise', 'rather', 'small', 'outdated', 'British', 'vessel', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'are', 'full', 'swing', 'England', 'danger', 'invasion', 'French', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'are', 'coast', 'Brazil', 'where', 'spot', 'very', 'fast', 'modern', 'French', 'ship', 'Aubrey', 'pursue', 'chase', 'way', 'tip', 'South', 'America', 'Galapolos', 'Islands', 'coast', 'Chile', 'final', 'confrontation', 'two', 'vessels', 'place.Crowe', 'Bettany', 'are', 'superb', 'two', 'friends', 'differences', 'make', 'perfect', 'counterpoints', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'narrative', 'action', 'watching', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Master', 'Commander', 'marvelous', 'entertainment', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'big', 'studio', 'movie', '2003']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748075,A32BPER1JFW1AQ,B00008W64E,M. Aves,"[0, 0]","Taken from the Aubrey-Maturin tales of author Patrick O'Brian, this film focuses on the Captain and crew of the H.M.S. Surprise, based on the captured (and renamed) french corvette of the same name.Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the film does an excellent job of portraying naval life and strategy of the early 19th Century, including the harsh conditions and to a degree the brutal discipline that typified the Royal Navy of that period.  Crowe plays the dashing Captain &#34;Lucky Jack&#34; Aubrey, loved and admired by his crew for his compassion, daring, and bravery and is counterbalanced by his close friend and ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany.  It is their friendship, and their ensuing personal conversations throughout many scenes in the film that provide most of the depth and internal struggles of these main characters as moving subplots to what is mostly a military drama.Focusing on the cat and mouse sea chase between the much larger and heavily armed/armored French Frigate Acheron, and the smaller lighter H.M.S. Surprise, the film also sheds light on a world before Darwin, when most of the known world had yet to be explored, and when navigation was done by sextant rather than GPS.As perhaps the only modern naval drama of the contemporary period, the film spares no opportunity to shed light on this age of tall wooden ships.  The brutality of naval warfare, and the crudeness of shipboard medical care is on full display and one cannot help but be both impressed and awed by the character and courage of the men who sailed in this period.The transfers are of excellent quality, and the bonus features - which include a pop-up map feature to indicate where the current action is taking place, are enjoyable but not distracting.  In fact I felt that this edition has the proper balance of special features and price as to not feel bloated with worthless add-ons to make for a very good value.Though Crowe's star has faded somewhat in recent years, this Blu Ray captures the actor at his peak even though his performance  is comparably subdued.  Crowe is alternately dark and severe, then light and raucous, and again boyishly mischievous - all the qualities one would expect to emanate naturally from a Royal Naval Captain, and some of his best moments on screen are when he says nothing at all and we see that drama playing out behind his eyes.  The scene where he makes eye contact with an indigenous woman while requisitioning is one fine example.I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, five stars being reserved for truly timeless and classic films worthy of such superlative rankings.  However, movie goers who are searching for gripping story lines with brilliants acting and cinematography will not be disappointed and will see their money well spent investing in this edition.",4,"A brilliant, character-driven period drama.",1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2826,"['Taken', 'Aubrey-Maturin', 'tales', 'author', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'film', 'Captain', 'crew', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'based', 'captured', 'renamed', 'french', 'corvette', 'same', 'name.Set', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'naval', 'life', 'strategy', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'including', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'degree', 'brutal', 'discipline', 'typified', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'period', 'Crowe', 'dashing', 'Captain', '34', 'Lucky', 'Jack', '34', 'Aubrey', 'loved', 'admired', 'crew', 'compassion', 'daring', 'bravery', 'counterbalanced', 'close', 'friend', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'played', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'friendship', 'ensuing', 'personal', 'conversations', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'provide', 'most', 'depth', 'internal', 'struggles', 'main', 'characters', 'moving', 'subplots', 'what', 'mostly', 'military', 'drama.Focusing', 'cat', 'mouse', 'sea', 'chase', 'much', 'larger', 'heavily', 'armed/armored', 'French', 'Frigate', 'Acheron', 'smaller', 'lighter', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'film', 'also', 'light', 'world', 'Darwin', 'when', 'most', 'known', 'world', 'had', 'yet', 'be', 'explored', 'when', 'navigation', 'was', 'done', 'sextant', 'rather', 'GPS.As', 'perhaps', 'only', 'modern', 'naval', 'drama', 'contemporary', 'period', 'film', 'opportunity', 'shed', 'light', 'age', 'tall', 'wooden', 'ships', 'brutality', 'naval', 'warfare', 'crudeness', 'shipboard', 'medical', 'care', 'full', 'display', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'awed', 'character', 'courage', 'men', 'who', 'sailed', 'period.The', 'transfers', 'are', 'excellent', 'quality', 'bonus', 'include', 'pop-up', 'map', 'feature', 'indicate', 'where', 'current', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'distracting', 'fact', 'felt', 'edition', 'proper', 'balance', 'special', 'features', 'price', 'not', 'feel', 'bloated', 'worthless', 'add-ons', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'Crowe', 'star', 'faded', 'somewhat', 'recent', 'years', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'actor', 'peak', 'even', 'performance', 'comparably', 'subdued', 'Crowe', 'alternately', 'dark', 'severe', 'then', 'light', 'raucous', 'again', 'boyishly', 'mischievous', 'qualities', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'emanate', 'naturally', 'Royal', 'Naval', 'Captain', 'best', 'moments', 'screen', 'are', 'when', 'nothing', 'see', 'drama', 'playing', 'out', 'eyes', 'scene', 'where', 'eye', 'contact', 'indigenous', 'woman', 'requisitioning', 'one', 'fine', 'example.I', ""'d"", 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'could', 'five', 'stars', 'being', 'reserved', 'truly', 'timeless', 'classic', 'films', 'worthy', 'such', 'superlative', 'rankings', 'However', 'movie', 'goers', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'gripping', 'story', 'lines', 'brilliants', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'see', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'investing', 'edition']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748076,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B00008W64E,M. B. Trapp,"[11, 12]","The trailers and TV ads for this film billed it as an action movie, a sort of Braveheart on the sea, and while the film does contain two major battles, it is a very different breed of historical epic: more introspective, more character-oriented than plot-oriented, and with an eye for historical detail to match any period documentary. I can only assume that the Patrick O'Brian novels are as elegant as Weir's script, and the performances by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany remind the viewer how different the present age is from ages past. There is no historical revisionism here, no transference of late 20th century liberal thought and practices onto historical characters who would have never held them.Crowe's Captain &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey is more than a fierce soldier: he is human as well. He embodies the effective leader. We see, for example, his fatherly love and respect for his junior officers alongside his fierce willingness to &quot;grind whatever grist the mill requires&quot; to fulfill his duty to king and country. But it is in the poignant moments with his friend, the ship doctor Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany) that the real man comes out. Capt. Aubrey is committed enough to make many sacrifices to fulfill his mission, but respects the counsel of his non-military minded friend as well. My favorite moments of the film are when Maturin and Aubrey put aside their jobs and enjoy a round of playing the violin and cello, respectively, in Aubrey'a quarters. There is a subtle beauty to these scenes that is likely inaccessible to moviegoers who have been weaned on knee-jerk action scenes and rushed character development.The plot itself is simple but masterful, centering on the nautical chess match waged between two determined and cunning foes: Capt. Aubrey and the nebulous French captain of the Acheron. The numerous subplots would be effective mini-films in themselves apart from the accompanying battles with the Acheron. We see in Aubrey and Maturin two very different men: one committed to warfare, the other to science, and this conflict of interests that exists throughout the film comes to a head when Aubrey must decide whether to allow Maturin to wander the Galapagos Islands studying new species or to push the Surprise on in an ill-starred attempt to capture the mighty Acheron. There is a give and take in this conflict that is the heart of the film, and I will leave it to you to witness the beauty of it.

The length, it wasn't ""appropriate"" to watch it at that particular moment in time, and the fact that I couldn't (notice the past tense) stand Russell Crowe. But when you're thinking that you'll never agree on a movie to watch, out comes the one that you've never had a chance to watch yet.The thing about M&C; is that it's very much a movie aimed at men. There is only one scene which features women, and it's very brief. The rest of the movie features men - manly men, wimpy men, rugged men, MEN. Now, while us ladies like our men, it can be a little bit overpowering especially in a 138 minute long movie. And when some of the cast look like they should be appearing in Oliver. But when you consider that the rumoured love interest for Russell's character was supposed to be Keira Knightley - I'll stick with all the men thanks.But back to the movie. For a 138 minute long movie, I'm surprised that it actually went by so fast. Even the setting didn't get boring - 90% of it is set on a ship after all. And the other setting was Galapagos Islands (I still don't know how to pronouce it).There's a pretty basic plot, but at the same time it's pretty involving, and at one point I was clenching my fists, desperate for the right ship to win. My only quibble was the cast - there was so many of them, I eventually lost track of who was who, and didn't even recognise Paul Bettany, despite having just watched him in Wimbledon. (I thought it was Jason Isaacs - duh.) The cast was very impressive, and all of them played their roles very well - even though I still have no idea who was who. A few of the cast could have easily walked off the ship and straight into a production of Oliver, which made me smile quite a lot.Russell was surprisingly good as well. I tend to stay away from his movies, as I just don't see the appeal. But he's not a terrible actor, and his portrayal of Capt.

I feel like I'm one of those people who loved Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies, but never read Tolkien's books! Apparently, fans of the M&C; novels are emotionally divided over this film version, just like fans of TLOTR books are over the movies. But I have to join those who feel that Master and Commander (the movie) must be an excellent adaptation of books to film.The single feature, I have to admit, which made me buy this DVD, is the inclusion in the film score of Ralph Vaughan Williams's, ""Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis"", used twice in the film when the pathos of death is invoked. It brings me close to tears whenever I listen to the entire tone poem; and heard during emotionally wrenching moments in M&C;, it did bring me to tears. So, ""Gotta have it!""I especially enjoyed the ""ship captain and his doctor friend"" relationship: so familiar to Star Trek (the OS) fans. It seems like a perenial pairing of opposite personality types. And Russell Crowe's captain to Paul Bettany's doctor are the central character dynamic that powers this story. They both admire each other, have a gulf-wide difference in what motivates their careers (which is at odds: the captain feels the doctor's scientific interests are mere ""hobbies""); and share a penchant for chamber music (which some members of the crew endure with muted agony).

748081,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00008W64E,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 6]","It should come as no surprise that Peter Weir's 2003 film ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" would come away from the Academy Awards with two Oscars after receiving ten Oscar nominations.  Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King""), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films ""The Truman Show"" (1998), ""Dead Poet's Society"" (1989) and ""Witness"" (1986). He also directed the films ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" (1982) and ""Gallipoli"" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director.""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" was based upon the 1970 novel ""Master and Commander"", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, ""The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey"", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of ""Master and Commander"" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby.With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three ""Lord of the Rings"" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.

The ship's captain (played by Russell Crowe) engages in a battle of wits, wills, and firepower with a rival captain during the perilous sea trek.This is a vivid, exciting tale of naval warfare, but it's also a satisfying and moving portrayal of a unique community: the company of a warship.  The film is full of stirring action scenes, but it is equally rich in the details of the men's everyday life: their food, shipboard entertainment, naval tradition, etc.  It's a sweaty, muscular portrait that really puts you in the midst of this fascinating world.Weir gets superb performances from the large ensemble cast.  Crowe won my heart as the captain: he portrays a man who is tough and witty, but also humane and reasonable.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, both a loyal friend and verbal sparring partner for the captain; it's a marvelously realized relationship.  The rest of the cast rises to the high mark set by these excellent performers; Max Pirkis in particular shines as a courageous young midshipman.There are some intense scenes of violence and combat surgery.  But this material is not gratuitous, and is handled with care by Weir, who never loses sight of his characters' humanity.  And the film is also about much more than war; it's also about exploring a distant land and seeing wondrous sights.  There are nice moments of humor to balance out the film's serious themes of military discipline, ethics and tactics.  Overall, M&amp;C is a rousing adventure story, told with heart.

Or do you ever feel that by taking a weekend or so off from the movies that you missing some great films? And then you hear you friends chatting about them, it makes the already bad situation even worse? Many can lay claim to being in that very situation, missing out on noting-worthy independent and less commercial films that eventually found their way to be acknowledged by the Motion Picture Academy at the 76th Annual Academy Awards in February 2004, while others weren't quite so lucky. Such note-worthy features that failed to receive recognition include Bad Santa, Phone Booth and The Singing Detective. This isn't to say that nominated projects such as Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and Lost in Translation aren't worthy of acknowledgment, far from it. It is to say this one thing in Hollywood has yet to change: The bigger the studio, the bigger the trophy case will be.The story is based on the tenth novel, ""The Far Side of the World"" in the ""Master and Commander"" series by Patrick O'Brian, who wrote twenty installments of the high-seas adventure series until his death in January 2000. The feature starts off in 1806 - Napoleon has proclaimed himself emperor of France after a failed attempt on his life and from there wages a military campaign which conquers Italy, Genoa, Vienna, and most of Austria and Germany. The Third Coalition, which consisted of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, has all but been decimated by severe defeats on land, thus leaving Britain and its advanced naval sea power as the only thing standing in the way of Napoleon and total victory over Europe. One of Britain's most impressive ships is the HMS Surprise, captained by the ambitious and commanding Jack Aubrey, who travels the world with his friend Stephen Maturin, who is also the ship's doctor. Along the Eastern coast of South America, Aubrey and his crew are ambushed by the French frigate, the Acheron. Though they escape in relatively one piece, the ship is deeply weakened and there is talk of turning back home to England. Faced with the fate of his crew and his country in his hand, Jack Aubrey must show true leadership by putting everything on the line and making quick decisions, no matter the cost. The story for Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the few films out there that embroils itself deeply in a certain time period of history but doesn't require its audience to have such extensive knowledge of events that it alienates certain demographics. Though the film doesn't demand background knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you go in with at least some idea of the events that the story surrounds itself with.Though Master & Commander contains a rather large cast, few have actually made a name for themselves that they are easily recognizable by a majority of the movie-going audience but that doesn't matter so much in that only one person requires the audience's full attention, that being Russell Crowe. Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his performance in Gladiator and was nominated for A Beautiful Mind, was certainly worthy of at least a nomination with his commanding performance as Captain Jack Aubrey, in which he combines slight humor, enduring emotions, and dignified atmosphere that envelops the audience and keeps them focused with the actions on screen. Unfortunately, despite the film itself receiving ten nominations, the academy failed to recognize Crowe's amazing performance but that is easily forgettable as long as the audiences that watch this film get their money's worth of the film, thanks mostly to Crowe's engaging Jack Aubrey. And it's not just Crowe but the character's actions within the film itself ... the fact that he darts across the deck of the ship in an attempt to be almost everywhere at once, his ability to be charming and eloquent while playing his violin while being forceful and compelling in battle, and sticking to his guns despite certain opposition and small consequences that occur because of that decision.Overall, Leadership, patriotism, and a true sense of responsibility and duty, all of which are desperately needed amongst a certain portion of the American people today, take center stage even away from Crowe's most commanding role to date. The most astonishing thing Peter Weir and his follow filmmakers have been able to do, besides elegantly and tastefully poking fun at the French, is to create a story that is slow and lumbering at times but not so much so that it results in a boring and lusterless feature, in fact Master & Commander is quite the opposite. It successfully keeps the audience members at the edge of their seats not only for the action occurring on screen but by keeping them in utter anticipation of events yet to unfold in the film as well. A beautifully mastered musical score, created by Christopher Gordon, Iva Davies and Richard Tognetti, keeps the historical time period in the context of the occurring actions in slower portions of the film while still engaging the audience with a rousing complement to the battle sequences. But the film's most powerful quality is its message of enduring leadership and dedication to one's country despite nearly impossible odds and the cost of friendship and life appearing to be worth more then the end result. The United States faces that exact challenge today but as the Jack Aubrey discovers, there is no more important value in life then a devotion to one's country and the commanding leadership that drives not only the crew but the heart and soul of one's country as well.",4,The Moose Hole - Weir 'Commands' 'Master'ful Film,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,5787,"['Do', 'feel', 'are', 'missing', 'films',

Moore,"[14, 14]","Having never read Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, I can't address how faithful Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is to the source material. (I have gleaned that the fans of O'Brian's novels probably wouldn't be satisfied with ANY film version.) I can definitely say, however, that Weir rivets our attention from the very first seconds of this movie, taking us into the far corners of the tall ship in the early morning fog, and never lets go of it until the final credits. Aided immeasurably by the magnficent camera work of Russell Boyd, Weir takes us into realms of thought, feeling and experience where the cinema seldom goes. He gives us a vivid picture of life aboard a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic wars, and draws us so deeply into the teamwork and camaraderie of the crew that we feel as if we're climbing the riggings ourselves. In a way, the actors are just as much a crew as the sailors they portray; none of them stands out, but all of them put their shoulders together and work as a perfect team, each man (there are, of course, no women on board) holding up his end to perfection. Even the starring performance of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, courageous and consummately skilled ship's captain, is a masterpiece of understated team playing; different in degree but not in kind from his mates, he commands the movie but never overwhelms or bullies it. Likewise, Paul Bettany--standing a little apart from the rest of the crew as ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin--is a marvel of quiet, unobtrusive authority. There are some great debates between Aubrey, man of action, and Maturin, man of intellect, on the conduct of war and the nature of command; yet in the end they work together as a team, their essential harmony symbolized by their duets on the violin and cello. (Of the other actors in the film, special mention must be made of 13-year-old Max Pirkis as midshipman Lord Blakeney, who--after suffering a series of extreme traumas--lives up to his promise as a budding commander of men.) ""Master and Commander"" is such a consistently compelling action film that it catches you by surprise with its frequent moments of tragic emotion (hint: don't get too attached to any of the characters).

748090,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00008W64E,"""mobby_uk""","[1, 1]","If ever there are prizes for the best directorial comebacks, then surely Peter Weir should have one. The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..I found myself transfixed at the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end of the film, elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.The scenery is quite impressive, especially the ones filmed in the Galapagos islands.Now the acting,I don't if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe! He simply plays the part to perfection, and you can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead role and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one.

If I had any complaints it would be that it needed more &#34;broadsides&#34; combat (although it was based on the novel and such combat may have been limited in the story itself) and the deleted scenes should have been blended into the movie to make an extended version (director's cut).

It's important for a film to grab the viewer or at least set a few things up to spark interest.  The first 20 minutes did just that.  BUT....... the next 1 hour plus just dragged and dragged with nothing happening of any importance and this is where the movie spun its wheels really badly.  It wasnt sure what to do with itself and just plodded along with some meaningless side-stories and situations.  I started yawning at one point just hoping that the early excitement came out again.  It barely did.  One interesting but too short battle sequence late and then it just fizzled off and was over.Russell Crow's character was pretty cool but I wasn't rooting for the guy or anything.  Most of the other shipmen were throw aways.... noone stood out or made anything of themselves.  Too bad.The battle scenes and camera work were solid and the sound of the cannons was awesome.  But, there was not enough action and too much dilly-dallyin' around.  Ultimately, this movie is boring and will help you sleep if you're having trouble.  The good reviews here at Amazon must be coming from large boat owners/hobbyists or ex-navy members because the general public will be squirming in their seat waiting for it to be over.The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes long and about a half hour of it actually has anything happening.

IMO it is wonderful! I am one who seeks out widescreen DVDs rather than full screen, and I found the picture and sound quality to be nearly identical to what I experienced upon first seeing the movie in the theatre. Those who found the movie ""too dark"" or had trouble understanding some of the dialogue will no doubt have the same criticism of the DVD presentation, but neither were a problem for me. The bonus material is excellent in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the made-for-DVD documentary ""The Hundred Days,"" which takes the viewer behind the scenes of the making of the movie, and ""In The Wake of O'Brian,"" a shorter documentary where Weir answers some of the questions about the focus of the movie that bothered many devotees of the canon. There are also short documentaries that cover the battle scenes, audio effects, and the storm scene, which are of especial interest to movie buffs. There is a companion booklet that would be helpful for those not familiar with the series and/or the careers of Peter Weir and Patrick O'Brian. The small map included is a little gimicky in my opinion, but your children or grandchildren might like it!

Let me state that I am a long time movie fan, have a large select library of movies and books, and feel the movie industry is letting us down generally. NOT HERE. Master and Commander is, I feel, Peter Weir's best effort and holds its own against Gregory Peck's Moby Dick as a historically accurate portrayal of the rigors of 1805 Naval life and battles. No detail is overlooked in superstition, man overboard, loss of life and limb,discipline by flogging, and the range of education/lack thereof within the crew. The acting is wonderful and the second disc fascinating showing how they did it all making the film.You feel the ship move, smell the smoke in battle, and feel the sea air as they climb the rigging. WOW.I was happily surprised by the use of classical music and the wonderful score done by Iva Davies,Christopher Gordon, and Richard Tognetti, Australian composers. This score is a true character in this movie used during the montages of daily shipboard duties, evading attack into the fogbank,beating to quarters,battles, and burial procedures. Wonderful treatment and SO important!The relationship between the two main male characters, the captain(Russell Crowe)and the ship's Doctor (Paul Bettany) is elevated by the fact they play stringed instuments well together and share that as a much needed outlet in the hardships,boredom, and terror of their life at sea.The final scene of Captain and Doctor playing a memorable piece as the ship turns about..WONDERFUL!

Peter Weir, director of 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, disrupts this trend with his skillful use of Crowe as the captain of a British warship in 1805, during the first war with Napoleon.  A French privateer ship called the Acheron is to be stopped by the British warship HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey.  The two ships chase each other all over the Southern Atlantic Ocean and in doing so, provide an excellent look at what life was like aboard a 19th century warship.  The harsh realities of the day-to-day grind, the fierce seas, the constant danger of attack, and the political struggles involving the ship's leadership - all make important contributions to this adventure story, which keeps the audience on the edges of their seats during its entire 138 minute runtime.LikeBlack Hawk Down, Master and Commander is more focused on the events and the crew, rather than on any single character.  The director's efforts to reproduce the realistic environment in which a sailor of the British fleet would find himself during the early 1800s are evident from the sheer volume of detail that is included in this picture.  Production designer William Sandell, and set decorator Robert Gould successfully manage to recreate the 19th century British style of decoration down to the smallest possible details.  The attempt to portray the events realistically does not end there as Weir has the actors covered in grime, grease, sweat, and filth, in contrast to the traditional Hollywood attempts at glossing over the grittier elements of film settings.  'Master and Commander' is more in keeping with the amazing work done by Wolfgang Petersen inDas Boot - The Director's Cutthan with the mediocre efforts inU-571 (Collector's Edition).  Director Peter Weir further avoids Hollywood clich&eacute;s by not engaging in excessive special effects during battle scenes, leaving out the dramatic fireballs that pervade the action genre, in favor of much more realistic explosions, damage, and injuries.  Russell Crowe shines in his role as Captain Aubrey in much the same way that he excelled in his role in 'Gladiator.'  The audience is able, through this movie, to experience the same awe and wonderment as those of the period must have experienced upon discovering all of the treasures in the New World.  Peter Weir's directorial prowess enables him to sail 'Master and Commander' into a level of distinction which will no doubt usher it into a place in the Best Picture category of next year's award ceremonies.

Weir takes all the great elements from O'Brien's fantastic novels (no less than three, by my count) and seamlessly creates a rousing story one delights in immersing himself in.The resulting script is even and satisfying, the effects stupendous, the music gorgeous, the costumes absolutely meticulous.From its slow opening, the film's momentum very quickly picks up.

Occasionally, an enemy ship will engage in battle; then the thrills and action will be accompanied by blood and fatalities.Welcome aboard the Surprise, a British navy ship during the Napoleonic Wars. Peter Weir (Gallipoli, The Truman Show) gives a grim and realistic picture of early 19th century battles and ship life. Russell Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) plays ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, captain of the Surprise. After attacked by a greater French ship, the Acheron, Aubrey is determined to find and defeat the ""Phantom Boat"", as it is at first dubbed. However, Aubrey's determination leads to near obsession as he peruses the Acheron (which is also following him) no matter what the odds are.The sails on the sailing ships are grimy, but still beautiful as they billow in the breeze. The movie itself is gritty but magnificent, and the sets and costumes are all created with exquisite care. Sailors are fairly grubby, the food is unappetizing, and light is faint when lanterns are its only source. The ships themselves are gorgeous, though tiny when compared to the number of men who serve on them.The scenery is absolutely stunning, even though most of the shots involve simply a ship or two surrounding by water, miles and miles of water. There are a few detours to the Galapagos Islands, which are filmed just as breathtakingly as the other scenes.Acting is first rate. Crowe is excellent, of course, as the dogged and resolute Captain Jack Aubrey, popular leader of the Surprise. The surgeon, played by Paul Bettany (Dogville, A Beautiful Mind), is another interesting character. He is an intellectual who questions the accepted British hierarchy and sailor superstitions, and is enthralled by natural science. Other characters include a young boy, Max Pirkis, in his first movie role, and an indecisive midshipman, played by Lee Ingleby. Most characters are not elaborated, but they are all believable and serve for some poignant moments.Dialogue is wonderful, literate, though it could be considered corny at times. The violence can be very grisly, especially in the aftermath of fighting, though the battles themselves are mercifully swift and blurred.Master and Commander is supported by rousing music. Despite its gore and realism, the movie is entertaining and stirring. Highly recommended, though the queasy may cringe at scenes. Fans of sea tales and adventures of any sort should not miss this.Minor Quibble: With the extensive attention to every detail in this movie, I wish they could have made the captain and the doctor look like they were actually playing stringed instruments.

748109,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B00008W64E,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[4, 5]","Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander,"" set in the Napoleanic era and based on the books by Patrick O'Brian, is probably one of the best films--of its genre--that I have seen in years. I was sorry that it missed out at Oscar Time, as I consider it superior to ""The Lord of the Rings."" (Although I'm a dedicated fan of the ""Rings"" trilogy, this is simply a better movie.) The script is fairly good, Weir's direction is excellent, and the cast is superb. The phone-throwing bad boy, Russell Crowe, may be a hellion offscreen, but he is a wonderful actor, who conveys the spirit and essence of Captain Jack Aubrey with verve and sensitivity. Paul Bettany, another brilliant and versatile actor, portrays the scholar/humanist/ship's physician Stephen Maturin, who is also Aubrey's best mate.Aubrey's frigate, the HMS Surprise, has been ordered to locate, and if possible, take as a prize, the Acheron, a French ship of greater size and strength. The film opens with a brief but violent skirmish between the two vessels, an encounter that leaves Aubrey with a desire for revenge, as well as the need to fulfill his mission. In the days and months that follow, ""Lucky Jack"" is forced to deal with the repairs to his damaged ship, grisly medical issues, disciplinary problems among the crewmen, a deadly storm, a suicide, and an accidental injury to Dr. Maturin--which occurs just at the moment that the elusive Acheron appears to be within reach. A rousing and realistic battle scene follows, as Aubrey uses trickery to face down the massive, more heavily armed French ship.""Master and Commander"" captures the atmosphere of life aboard ship, and the claustrophobic environment below decks, as no other film has done, with the exception of ""Das Boot."" Some viewers complained about the ""choppy"" quality of the final fight scene's cinematography, but this ""choppiness"" serves a purpose. You actually feel as though you are standing on deck with the ship rolling beneath you, surrounded by the haphazard chaos of battle. Throughout the film Weir's use of music, as in nearly all of his movies, contributes to the emotional draw of the imagery. Excerpts from works by Boccherini, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and other composers, as well as folk tunes, are used to good effect.In addition to remarkable performances by Crowe and Bettany, we see excellent work by virtually the entire crew. Particularly memorable are Max Pirkis as the very youthful midshipman Lord Blakeney, Lee Ingleby as the sadly insecure midshipman Hollom, James D'Arcy as Lieutenant Pullings, Robert Pugh as Mr. Allen, the sailing master, and Max Benitz as another brave young midshipman. An element of comic relief is provided from time to time by David Threlfall, as Aubrey's dour-faced steward, and Richard McCabe, as the surgeon's mate. Billy Boyd, of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame, makes an appearance as Bonden, the coxswain. Scenes between Bettany and an angel-faced young Max Pirkis are particularly appealing, as the doctor/naturalist imparts his enthusiasm for scientific discovery to an intelligent and willing pupil.DVD extras include an entertaining documentary, ""The Hundred Days,"" and an ""HBO First Look,"" as well as other tidbits and a few deleted scenes.",5,Quite masterful!,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,3220,"['Peter', 'Weir', 'Master', 'Commander', 'set', 'Napoleanic', 'era', 'based', 'books', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'was', 'sorry', 'missed', 'out', 'Oscar', 'Time', 'consider', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""'m"", 'dedicated', 'fan', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'simply', 'better', 'movie', 'script', 'fairly', 'good', 'Weir', 'direction', 'excellent', 'cast', 'superb', 'phone-throwing', 'bad', 'boy', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'may', 'be', 'hellion', 'offscreen', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'who', 'conveys', 'spirit', 'essence', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'verve', 'sensitivity', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'brilliant', 'versatile', 'actor', 'scholar/humanist/ship', 'physician', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'who', 'also', 'Aubrey', 'best', 'mate.Aubrey', 'frigate', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'been', 'ordered', 'locate', 'possible', 'take', 'prize', 'Acheron', 'French', 'ship', 'greater', 'size', 'strength', 'film', 'brief', 'violent', 'skirmish', 'two', 'vessels', 'encounter', 'Aubrey', 'desire', 'revenge', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'days', 'months', 'follow', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'forced', 'deal', 'repairs', 'damaged', 'ship', 'grisly', 'medical', 'issues', 'disciplinary', 'problems', 'crewmen', 'deadly', 'storm', 'suicide', 'accidental', 'injury', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'just', 'moment', 'elusive', 'Acheron', 'be', 'reach', 'rousing', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scene', 'Aubrey', 'trickery', 'face', 'down', 'massive', 'more', 'heavily', 'armed', 'French', 'ship', 'Master', 'Commander', 'atmosphere', 'life', 'ship', 'claustrophobic', 'environment', 'decks', 'other', 'film', 'done', 'exception', 'Das', 'Boot', 'viewers', 'complained', 'choppy', 'quality', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'cinematography', 'choppiness', 'purpose', 'actually', 'feel', 'are', 'standing', 'deck', 'ship', 'rolling', 'beneath', 'surrounded', 'haphazard', 'chaos', 'battle', 'film', 'Weir', 'use', 'music', 'nearly', 'movies', 'contributes', 'emotional', 'draw', 'imagery', 'Excerpts', 'works', 'Boccherini', 'Ralph', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'other', 'composers', 'as', 'well', 'folk', 'tunes', 'are', 'used', 'good', 'effect.In', 'addition', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Crowe', 'Bettany', 'see', 'excellent', 'work', 'virtually', 'entire', 'crew', 'Particularly', 'memorable', 'are', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'very', 'youthful', 'midshipman', 'Lord', 'Blakeney', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'sadly', 'insecure', 'midshipman', 'Hollom', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'Lieutenant', 'Pullings', 'Robert', 'Pugh', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'sailing', 'master', 'Max', 'Benitz', 'brave', 'young', 'midshipman', 'element', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'time', 'time', 'David', 'Threlfall', 'Aubrey', 'dour-faced', 'steward', 'Richard', 'McCabe', 'surgeon', 'mate', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fame', 'appearance', 'Bonden', 'coxswain', 'Scenes', 'Bettany', 'angel-faced', 'young', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'are', 'particularly', 'appealing', 'doctor/naturalist', 'enthusiasm', 'scientific', 'discovery', 'intelligent', 'willing', 'pupil.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'Hundred', 'Days', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'tidbits', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Jack Aubrey who commands the HMS Surprise to patrol the South Atlantic in search of the Acheron, an elusive French warship that is larger, faster, and has more cannon decks. Russell Crowe's bold command is often challenged by his friend and ship's surgeon played by Paul Bettany.The film is mostly accurate as to details on sailing vessels of the 19th century as well as the types of tasks sailors had to undertake. The film shows that sailors were not only hoisting sails on ships but that each ship had specialists on board to tend to various matters: carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, soldiers, etc. The film also accurately captures what tactics and battle conditions would have been like during that period of time. The only inaccuracy is where one ship is in pursuit of the other and the ship in front is blowing smoke: if one pays attention, one will see the smoke blowing back against the wind and towards the ship in pursuit. This presents a physical impossibility as the smoke would have to be blowing in the same direction as the wind and not against it.Despite some technical inaccuracies, the film is exquisite in every way. The film is has good character development and the plot is well paced; I didn't feel the time pass. The film is rated PG-13 but the violence is not so light as to make it childish.

The story, excellent special effects, moving score, and stunning acting is what makes this movie great.The Story: The HMS SURPRISE, a Brig `O War, has been sent to the region around South America.  Their mission is to destroy the French ship named: The ACHERON, which is, intent on taking the war to those regions.  The story fleshes out as Capt. Jack Abrey must use every trick up his sleeve to win against the bigger, better Acheron.  The story is very good and the writers should be applauded.The Special Effects:  The opening scene of the Surprise and Acheron dueling it out is a testament of how great spcial effects can look.  Splinters of wood fly everywhere, and the cannons look realistic.  The scenes of the Surprize sailing are very amazing.  The ship is very detailed and looks like a real ship was used.The Score:  The violen music by Yo Yo MA is definately something that added to this movie.  He plays the violen better than anyone I have ever heard.  The music that is done by the orchestra is similarily excellent.  Music ranges from fast-paced battle music, to sad, quiet music.  I highly suggest buying the score along with the movie.The Acting:  As always, Russell Crowe, (Jack Aubrey) delivers a stunning performance as a Captain of an English Warship. Paul Bettany, (Stephen Maturin)likewise performs his roll very well as a doctor.  The other actors in this movie do a great job at their parts.Verdict:  Buy this movie along with the soundtrack.

748112,A14B2NR2XELLQ0,B00008W64E,Omer Belsky,"[112, 208]","I came to 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' with little expectations beyond reasonable entertainment.  I was thus surprised that this was a powerful little human drama about a vicious chase in the high seas.What makes 'Master and Commander' successful is not the plot, which is a straightforward cat and mouse story.  Rather, it succeeds because of its gritty sense of realism and the ability to capture the feel of time and place.While most historical movies feature ordinary, contemporary people in period dress (see 'Gangs of New York'), Master and Commander does feel like it takes place in the early 19th century.  It is little things, like Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) motivating his troops by demanding ""Do you want your children to sing 'La Marseillaise'?"", or the real excitement the characters display in discussing Nelson.Also powerful is the film's feel for the hardships of warfare on the Sea.  Early in the film, a child loses his arm, and throughout the movie real characters suffer casual death.  At one point Jack Aubrey must choose between saving one man and saving his crew, and he allows the man to drown.  This form of realism is so rare in Hollywood films, in makes 'Master and Commander' truly unique.The great weakness of the film is its episodic nature.  There is scarcely a plot - the hunt for the French frigate ""Acheron"" is merely a framework for the individual happenings, which include a storm, a suicide, and most infamously, a rather overlong subplot about Crowe's sidekick's (Paul Bettany) Darwin-like expedition to Galapagos Islands.Indeed, the emergence of this subplot makes the second half of the film slow and much less interesting then the first half. Although the scenery is breathtaking, the story just fails to move, until Bettany's accidental discovery of the Acheron, which sets the stage for the climatic battle.Director Peter Weir and his crew should be commanded for a great adaptation of Patrick O'Brien's seafaring adventure.

748113,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00008W64E,OverTheMoon,"[2, 8]","M&C; is not the best film you will ever see, nor is it the best marine film you will ever see, or the best war film you will ever see, but it is nautical miles ahead of the other disastrous `pirate movies' (M&C; is a mix of oldskool pirate films and war on the sea genres), except for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which has set a standard that M&C; can not seem to match - except on the acting/dialogue front and possibly the cinematography, however the choreography for the action sequences is not good, appears disjointed, and many elements of the story are simply left to drift ashore while we sail through a boring patch of the four seasons.M&C; is a film of many elements (Darwin, science vs war, superstitions, commanders matching wits), but sadly remains somewhat disengaging throughout the whole affair and this is a problem of not fleshing out the characters enough... or trying to cope with too many characters. In fact we learn very little, if nothing, of our heroic sailors save for the various moments in Captain Jack's (Crowe) dining quarters where he makes some philosophical statements about sailing and that is that. Emotions are derived from watching children die in the heat of battle and although at times this is gruelling to watch, you will soon get board of this theme.Film director Peter Weir does miss the mark as many critics have pointed out. While correctly opting for lots of battle sequences, he doesn't pull everything off so well and confusion reigns in several key action moments. So when the camera is not focused on cannon shells flying through masts it is drifting between umpteen characters and ship hands who all have a line, but little more than that. Even one of our favourite hobbits (Boyd) only shows up for a few scenes. Also Crowe's role is almost eclipsed by Paul Bettany playing Dr. Stephen Maturin the Surgeon who becomes a major pivotal character and a plot device, but this is because M&C; looses control of who should be at the helm at times but never really tries to be anything more than just a battle between two boats on the sea (The Brits on the `Surprise' vs Napoleon's `Acheron'). For this reason many who go to see the acting will get a little of what they wanted. Those who want to see planks splinter and riggings hurtling through the air will get their fair share of that too. However together the gel doesn't really glue and something tells this reviewer that some more character development on the pivotal roles would have a gone a long way.... even to the far side of the world. While this movie has mammoth production values (everything looks sublime and the boats awesome) a finely tuned script would not have hurt this piece one little bit.Weir has given us a good movie that is well worth watching but does not really register as something you will remember the next day. As far as the DVD release goes, you will certainly find a lot worse and for all intensive purposes this is a family film with some moderate historical violence. I guess if you are looking for a more gung-ho ""Gladiator"" type of film you will disappointed.

748114,AE03WS2GERIQF,B00008W64E,Parity,"[0, 0]","I went to the theatre thinking this may be an okay film and came out totally enthused. This is well written, well directed, well shot, well acted, well scored, humourous, action packed, thoughtful, with fantastic effects that for the most part you don't even notice are effects (perhaps more a testament to how engrossed I was than anything else).Seeing it again on DVD I have to concede it loses some of the big screen impact but what adventure doesn't?I could got into the plot in detail but why spoil things, you don't have long to wait for things to happen in any case. Rent / buy the movie sit down and let things take their own course. If you're at all squeamish then there are one or two points at which you may need to close your eyes, or perhaps your mind's eye as nothing is ever really too graphic it just seems that way because the director has led you to what is happening rather than presenting it in the modern 'in your face style'. If you like action it's there, if you like the majestic tall ships of old they are beautifully recreated. Russel Crowe is perfect as Captain Aubrey and wonderfully played off against Paul Bettany's ships doctor.If you like older movies for their craft but appreciate more modern production values (particularly cgi guys who appreciate the value of keeping as many shots as possible anchored in reality by using real footage as the foundation) then this will delight you. The waves around the Horn are built upon footage shot there. Some of the sequences set on the Galapagos islands were filmed there. They had a real ship that they used at sea with a full-size recreation gimballed in the water tank and immaculately crafted large scale models all blended together seamlessly on celluloid. You've got to love it for the attention to detail if nothing else.Watch. Be delighted. This is a keeper.P.S.

748117,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00008W64E,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[1, 1]","The year was 1805 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.  France and England were in a seemingly relentless life and death struggle for control of the seas.  In those days the oceans were where the major battles were fought.  Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has drawn an especially difficult assignment.  As Commander of the British man-of-war ""Surprise"" he has been ordered to pursue the bigger, faster and highly elusive French privateer ""Acheron"" and ""burn, sink or take her a prize.""  Furthermore, unbeknownst to his crew Aubrey has been ordered to chase the ""Acheron"" all the way to Brazil and beyond if necessary.  ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" is director Peter Weir's unforgettable account of this high stakes game of cat and mouse.  This is not the kind of film that I ordinarily enjoy very much but much to my surprise it worked for me on a great many levels.As the film opens we find the ""Surprise"" under attack by the ""Acheron"".  In the course of this battle royale the ""Surprise"" is severely damaged and its rudder disabled.  Although I am not usually a big fan of special effects I thought that they were used quite effectively in this film.  I definitely got the sense of what it must be like to be a participant in such a battle  It was painfully realistic I thought.  Meanwhile, in retaliation ""Surprise"" manages to score several direct hits on the French boat.  Unfortunately the cannon balls were unable to penetrate the hull of this newly designed ship.  If it were not for the fact that the ""Surprise"" was able to manuever itself into a foggy patch this ongoing battle would have been over right then and there.  Much to the chagrin of his crew Captain Aubrey vows to track down and capture or destroy his nemesis ""no matter the cost"".  Many of the men complain that this is a suicide mission and want no part of it.  We follow the crew of the ""Surprise"" as it pursues the ""Acheron"" down the east coast of South America.  One of the things that is most striking about this crew is that many of the sailors appear to be just teenagers.  In fact there are a few young boys on the ship who seem to be only 12 or 13 years old!  I simply cannot imagine being placed in these kind of circumstances at such a tender age.Along the way we meet other members of the crew.  Paul Bettany does a workmanlike job in his portrayal of Dr. Stephen Maturin the ship surgeon.  Maturin is a close personal friend of Captain Aubrey and is not afraid to tell the boss when he is convinced that he is making the wrong decision.  We also catch a glimpse of how the officers and crew spend their down time.  We discover that Captain Aubrey enjoys playing of all things the violin!  My wife especially enjoyed the work of James D'Arcy as First Lt. Thomas Pullings and Edward Woodall as Second Lt. William Mowett.  She is a big fan of Charles Dickens and noted that these colorful charactors could have been created by Dickens himself!  One of the most poignant scenes in ""Master and Commander"" is when Captain Aubrey has to make a split-second decision to cut loose a young sailor who went overboard while trying to repair a sail.  It seems that the mast snapped and fell over dumping the young man into the sea with it.  Tragically, the weight of the mast threatened to capsize the entire boat and so the decision was made to cut the mast loose to save the crew.  It was a heartbreaking moment to say the least.  Oh, the burdons of command!The pursuit of the ""Acheron"" continued right around Cape Horn at the bottom of South America and right on into the Pacific.  Before the final climactic battle the ''Surprise"" stops at the Galapagos Islands.  While there we catch a glimpse of some of the exotic birds and mammals that are indigenous to this island.  For just a brief moment you get the feeling that you are watching some kind of sci-fi flick. Dr. Maturin has been waiting all his life to see specimens like this but duty calls and the Captain orders the ship onward and outward in pursuit of its real prize.  Before long the pivotal final battle will take place.I was quite surprised to learn that ""Master and Commander""  The Far Side of the World"" is one of the most expensive movies ever made. This film was nominated for an impressive total of 10 Academy Awards including ""Best Picture"" and came away with two awards.  I thought that the photography throughout this film was magnificent.  Meanwhile, I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredible music score much of which was written and perfomed by the noted Australian violinist Richard Tognetti (no relation).  In fact,  Mr. Tognetti acually coached Russell Crowe on how to play the violin in preparation for this film.  One final word.  ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" is a great family movie.  Just be prepared for a couple of scenes that feature some very necessary but gruesome medical procedures performed by Dr. Maturin.  The good doctor even assists in surgery on himself!  As the President might say this could be used as one of those ""teachable moments"" to explain to your kids about the horrors of war.  ""Master and Commander""  turns out to be a film that greatly exceeded my expectations. This is not usually the kind of film I go for.

I felt that Peter Weir took several volumes of O'Brian's incredible opus, cut them to pieces, shook 'em in a basket, then pulled out random bits and duct-taped them together.  I don't see why.  Even one book could have been filmed as a miniseries.Crowe, Bettany, et al did their best, I'm sure.  Killick was perfect.  The shipboard details were superb.  Maturin's little office looked much like the one on the Victory.  The look and sound were superb, but the plot had no shape or direction.Trying to shove book 1 & book 10 together was as graceful as a front-end collision.  Taking chunks of story from different decades and mixing them like hash made for some really stupid bits.  Maturin wouldn't have been complaining about someone getting flogged for shoving an officer -- not after he'd been aboard for several years.  Likewise the old salt explaining to the youngster the difference between a pirate and a privateer.  This kid's been on board for months -- that would have been explained long since.  It was in character but out of sync -- as Gene Roddenberry once said, it would be like Joe Friday explaining how a pistol works.There were breathtaking scenes:  the storm at sea, where wreckage must be cut away to save all the men aboard, but at the cost of a life.  The scenes of the ship moving quietly through the water, to the sound of the violin and cello... the heart-stopping battle scenes, with the amplified boom making the theatre rattle.  As usual these days, special effects were superb.  The actors were wonderful.  The cast gave uniformly skilled performances, and did their best with what they had to work with.But the story ... I felt that the writers who eviscerated and reconstituted the story didn't have a clue about the heart of this remarkable series.  It will probably do well.  It has fine acting, superb cinematography, convincing battle scenes, and almost no soul at all. Book One, Master and Commander, would have made a fine film all on its own, and I can't for the life of me understand why they buggered it up so thoroughly.I understand that O'Brian's son, who apparently inherited the rights to the books, had a lot of resentment toward his father.

Master and Commander intends to be an intelligent epic, qualites more than the intelligence that hold us. It's a big picture that yet doesn't feel compromised. There are moments, especially when the story fatalistically hints at inexplicable/supernatural forces, when it feels very much like a Weir movie.

Here, he plays ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a warship on the trail of the Archeron, a French raider in Napoleon's navy heading down the South American coast. Just as James Cameron used state-of-the-art movie technology to transport his audience inside the fabled and ill-fated luxury liner Titanic, so too does Weir - and using the same studio facilities in Baja California that Cameron used - to portray life in the Royal British Navy of the period. Sparing no details, he provides the most vivid depiction yet of the sea battles of those days, and as harrowing as some of the sequences are, you may feel the same as the young seaman whom Aubrey employs to play a desperate and dangerous trick on the Archeron.

748125,A2EJP1CB7YGPNK,B00008W64E,Philip B. Yochim,"[1, 2]","Wow! What a spectacular adventure! I thought to myself after seeing this movie. Even the slow parts kept my attention. It could have been a six-hour mini-series and I still would have sat through it!Within the short time of watching life abroad the HMS Surprise, I felt as if I was part of the crew, I knew the men so well. The studious ship surgeon, salty old seamen, insecure junior officers, and the crusty cook. Of course, none commanded the respect of the captain, ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey.Russell Crowe demands the same respect from the audience as he did in ""Gladiator,"" as someone who leads by his presence, strength, and umimpeachable sense of duty. The viewer feels his conviction as he orders his men to pursue the French ""Acheron,"" a more powerful warship that has already crippled his ship. In a desperate race, he patches up the ship and pursues it around South America chasing it into deadly high seas contest.Even though Aubrey comes across as a ""nice guy"" much of the time, it's clear he is ""master and commander"" and tolerates no disrespect, be it a mouthy seaman or his best friend.While Crowe drives much of the movie, it is also fueled by an equally strong performance by Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's surgeon and naturalist. What makes him such a strong foil for Crowe is not their differences, but their similarities. Both are driven by a sense of duty, but their goals are different and conflicting. Knowing they are close friends makes their conflict all the more intense.The sense of realism strikes true for much of the film too. You can feel the freezing winds of the Horn, experience the loneliness of a professional sailor's heart, hear the snapping lines in the gale, smell the stench of gunpowder, and feel the heat of the doldrums.

748126,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B00008W64E,"Phred ""Phred""","[3, 3]","Final recommendation first: This is a good movie. Possibly the best of the Napoleonic period, navy movies -ever (full stop, no further qualifications)Now for the review:Once upon a time His Majesty's Royal Navy had the following officer ranks: Midshipman, usually a child or very young boy whose main job was to learn the seafaring craft. His battle station would normally be amidships, where he would best be able to repeat the orders of the Captain.Lieutenant - a Midshipman who has passed his examination or by heroic action been advanced to permanent rank. A lieutenant was generally considered to be able to perform any duties normally assigned to a Naval Officer.Captain, or Post Captain. Once you made ""Post"" you were deemed fitted to command a ship, note that in this case the term `Ship' means more than a big boat. As in a ship rigged or ship or the line.Once you made Post, all you had to do was live long enough and you could expect to make the final rank: Admiral. As an Admiral, you could be expected to command fleets or similar major shore commands.A Lieutenant, placed in command of a smaller ship, such as a small frigate, would be a Lieutenant (Commanding). He would have over-all charge of the ship and final responsibility as regards to her mission and general state of readiness. The ships master or Sailing Master was the person charged with the navigation and general sailing of the ship. Where the Admiralty felt that the Lieutenant (Commanding) was an accomplished sailor, he would be titled as Master and Commander.With that as background, we have ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander of his favorite ship - HMS Surprise (variously a 5th rate or 6th rate frigate rating 28 guns) wherein, many years before he had first served as midshipman. Indeed, the HMS Surprise still caries his initials carved into the top of the mainmast where he had been ""masted"" as punishment.Serving along side of Lieutenant (Master and Commander) Aubry is best friend and ships surgeon, Stephen Maturin.  The Ship's mission is to hunt down and destroy the American built, French ship the Acheron (44 guns and at least a 3rd rate ship). The French ship is larger, faster and almost magically better informed about the Surprise. None of these facts would have mattered to the British Admiralty. The Admiralty would have gladly broken Lucky Jack and left him beached, with no paying commission as they all knew that HM's frigates never lost in single ship actions.Unfortunately the Acheron would open the movie by dealing a hugely destructive and unanswered broadside to the surprised, Surprise.  The Acheron would then sail off to the far side of the world: Around the Horn and into the Pacific. The Surprise would be left to make and, mend before, acting in excess of her orders begin the hard, life threatening trek in the wake of the Acheron. Meantime there would remain the problem of how the little Surprise would succeed her next meeting.So much for the plotThe Aubrey Maturin books by Patrick O' Brian are among the true classics of Naval Literature. I have read them all at least twice, heard them on CD or tape at least as many times, and will likely do the same again. I fully agree with those would compare his style to Jane Austin's with the important difference that O'Brian has things happen and does not need the extra 200 pages to get to them.Jack Aubry and Horatio Hornblower would have enjoyed each others company. O'Brian's writing  however is a far more nuanced and complex than Forester's.Master and Command the Movie, is a mash up of several of the early Aubrey, Maturin novels. This may offend the true literary loyalist, for me it was not a problem. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Lucky Jack. This is the same performance he gives in Gladiator and Robin Hood, never mind it works here. Paul Bettany, could have been born to play Steven Maturin. He is physically, mentally and otherwise the right foil and true friend to Crowe's Aubrey.The only real complaint I have ever had about this movie is that it so completely captures the seagoing aspects of the O'Brian Novels that there is no need for a sequel. Of late I am going to pin my hopes on the fact that this movie only scratches the surface of the many faces of Dr. Maturin, Physician, Naturalist and not portrayed here, Spy! Further, Lucky Jack is a man of many problems dealing with life ashore. Between a few love affairs too many, bad political and financial judgments there is much left in the literary series that could be made into more Aubrey/Maturin movies.Movie makers are you listening?",5,"Worth it!

It's period and naval history is unequaled.  I've never seen a movie that shows so much of 19th century naval tradition and warfare.  If you are a military history buff, you will really appreciate the level of detail in this movie.  Especially if you opt for this special edition with loads of extra stuff.If you are less on history and more on action, this movie also has plenty to offer.  You will be dazzled as Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the HMS Surprise stick it to the Frenchies!  The violence is gritty and shocking, but relevant to the style of warfare and reality of the time.However don't be fooled by the violence and militaristic machismo in this movie.  This movie is as smart and sophisticated as they come.  The character development between the Captain and his Doctor best-friend is as compelling as the action in the film.  And the sophistication really kicks in when there is a scene where they play a violin-cello duet (some felt this was too slow of a scene but I felt it was a great relaxiing break from all the tension).

748132,A260X99UW6HA9Z,B00008W64E,Prauge Traveler,"[6, 6]","The movie debut of Patrick O'Brian's amazing series of Naval Fiction was an event I regarded with a mixture of anticipation and dread.  Anticipation because the enjoyment that resulted in reading his books could be relived in a new medium on the big screen, and dread because I feared that Hollywood would do to the books what it seems to do best: butcher them.  I am pleased to say that Peter Weir's rendition of the Aubrey/Maturin novels does the books justice.  This movie is very enjoyable, to both those who have read the books, and those who have not.Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are reunited (the pair did an excellent job in ""A Beautiful Mind""), and continue to perform very well together.  I can say that when I began rereading the series here in Baghdad to pass the time, I now see both of them in my mind's eye as I read, and it has enhanced the experience, not distracted me.  The other cast and crew do noteworthy jobs as well.The ship used to represent the HMS Surprise was the recreated HMS Rose, a tall ship that currently sails the seas today- I believe you can visit the website somewhere on the internet.  I believe the ship deserves almost as much note as the actors, because without her the movie would have been far lacking.  I've been fortunate enough to sail in her once myself, and Weir uses the Rose to good effect in this film: the sailing scenes and battle scenes are the best I've ever watched, by far.The story presented here is composed of a composite of conversations, and events, pulled from throughout the book series, and I believe that this was a good decision.  We can hardly expect Crowe, Bettany, and Weir to produce a 20 movie run.  However, they can take the best elements of the series and (hopefully) make a memorable movie series that is loosely based on the novels.In this film, Aubrey and Maturin are given the mission of `taking, sinking or burning' a French frigate, the Acheron, sent to prey on the British shipping in the Pacific.  The movie takes them from the waters of the south Atlantic to the Pacific and a long naval battle that pushes their ship and the men to the limits.  The Acheron has a seemingly uncanny appreciation for what Aubrey will do, giving way to a desperate conclusion that will keep you on the edge of your seat.This special edition DVD release contains some great special features, including the usual `making of' documentaries, cut scenes, and interviews.

748133,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00008W64E,Publius,"[6, 6]","Many have critiqued this movie as overly long and boring.  I would contend that that was precisely what director Peter Weir was trying to do.  Look, this movie is about a ship of war and the men on it during the height of the Napoleonic war.  The movie is book ended by two incredibly filmed battle scenes.  In between, life on a ship in the early 19th century is examined in harsh detail.  Of course, to any reader of Patrick O'Brian's novels, the highlight of the film is the relationship between Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin.  No one could have played the temperamental Aubrey better then Crowe, and no one could have played the intellectual Maturin better then Paul Bettany.  Probably the one scene that contrasts these two characters is where the ""Surprise"" reaches the Galapagos.  Here we see Maturin stare out the port side contemplating biology and nature, while Aubrey stares out the starboard side looking for any evidence of the enemy.  Aubrey is the man of action who holds onto the notion of national pride, while Maturin, always the intellectual, is indeed a man of the future.  Although they are two different personalities, they complement each other well and their friendship forms the spine of not only the movie but also the great series of books.  After watching this movie, especially in the theater, one could almost feel that they were actually on the H.M.S. Surprise for 2 hours.  Peter Weir has always directed pieces that demonstrated the terrible stress and travails of war.  There was probably a temptation by the producers to dumb down the movie and not talk about weather gauges, mizzen-masts or broadsides.  This temptation must have been great because four separate studios financed the project.  (20th Century Fox, Miramax Films, Universal Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn Films LLC).  Much credit should be given to Weir for not dumbing down the original spirit of O'Brian's work.

Viewers, however, have to have clear expectations about this film.  This is not a direct translation of any of Patrick O'Brian's historical novels about Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin to the screen.  It is fairer to say that this is a historical adventure movie inspired by the Aubrey/Maturin books.  It would be impossible and totally unfair to expect reproduction of any or all of the Aubrey/Maturin books on the screen.  The movie format doesn't really allow the character development inherent in any of these outstanding novels and the constraints of a movie don't allow the range of characters and scenes possible in a novel.  The makers of this film have taken a number of episodes from the Aubrey/Maturin canon, modified and combined them into an essentially new plot.  Significant compromises have been made in the interest of dramatic intensity.  Aubrey is the center of the story with Maturin playing an important but ancillary role.  The movie necessarily lacks the depth and complexity of the books.  With these points in mind, this is an excellent movie.  The attention to period detail seems excellent.  The depictions of life aboard a Napoleonic warship and naval combat are riveting.  Some of the scenes of HMS Surprise (actually the Rose, a Canadian made contemporary reproduction of a square rigged ship) under sail are beautiful.  The director, Peter Weir, and the screenwriters made the very intelligent decision to make the ship, HMS Surprise, itself, and the crew, important characters in the story.  This is not actually novel.  In a sense, this movie is a 19th century version of an established Hollywood genre, the submarine movie.  In submarine movies, a boat, crew, and officers are pitted against a largely unseen set of enemies, very similar to the plot of this movie.  Weir and his team are careful also to introduce much of the humor that is an important component of O'Brian's books.  The quality of acting, including a literally commanding performance by Russell Crowe, is excellent.  I do feel that the script could have done a better job of reproducing the early 19th century English idioms that O'Brian features but the decision to use a more contemporary English is understandable.  I hope this film is a significant commercial success.  The screenplay clearly sets the stage for a sequel and my guess is that the screenwriting team has developed a plot outline for one or two sequels that would incorporate more of the Aubrey/Maturin saga and more completely develop the characters of Aubrey and especially Maturin.",4,Excellent,1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,2670,"['very', 'enjoyable', 'realistic', 'historical', 'adventure', 'film', 'greatly', 'level', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Viewers', 'however', 'have', 'have', 'clear', 'expectations', 'film', 'not', 'direct', 'translation', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'historical', 'novels', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'screen', 'fairer', 'say', 'historical', 'adventure', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Aubrey/Maturin', 'books', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'totally', 'unfair', 'expect', 'reproduction', 'Aubrey/Maturin', 'books', 'screen', 'movie', 'format', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'character', 'development', 'inherent', 'outstanding', 'novels', 'constraints', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'range', 'characters', 'scenes', 'possible', 'novel', 'makers', 'film', 'have', 'taken', 'number', 'episodes', 'Aubrey/Maturin', 'canon', 'modified', 'combined', 'essentially', 'new', 'plot', 'Significant', 'compromises', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'interest', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'Aubrey', 'center', 'story', 'Maturin', 'playing', 'important', 'ancillary', 'role', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'depth', 'complexity', 'books', 'points', 'mind', 'excellent', 'movie', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'excellent', 'depictions', 'life', 'Napoleonic', 'warship', 'naval', 'combat', 'are', 'riveting', 'scenes', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'actually', 'Rose', 'Canadian', 'made', 'contemporary', 'reproduction', 'square', 'rigged', 'ship', 'sail', 'are', 'beautiful', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'screenwriters', 'made', 'very', 'intelligent', 'decision', 'make', 'ship', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'crew', 'important', 'characters', 'story', 'not', 'actually', 'novel', 'sense', 'movie', '19th', 'century', 'version', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'genre', 'submarine', 'movie', 'submarine', 'movies', 'boat', 'crew', 'officers', 'are', 'pitted', 'largely', 'unseen', 'set', 'enemies', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'movie', 'Weir', 'team', 'are', 'careful', 'also', 'introduce', 'much', 'humor', 'important', 'component', ""O'Brian"", 'books', 'quality', 'acting', 'including', 'literally', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'excellent', 'do', 'feel', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'reproducing', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'English', 'idioms', ""O'Brian"", 'features', 'decision', 'use', 'more', 'contemporary', 'English', 'understandable', 'hope', 'film', 'significant', 'commercial', 'success', 'screenplay', 'clearly', 'stage', 'sequel', 'guess', 'screenwriting', 'team', 'developed', 'plot', 'outline', 'one', 'two', 'sequels', 'would', 'incorporate', 'more', 'Aubrey/Maturin', 'saga', 'more', 'completely', 'develop', 'characters', 'Aubrey', 'especially', 'Maturin']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Russel Crowe's Jack Aubrey demonstrates that trait beautifully.Leadership aside though, the movie's attention to seafaring detail is phenomenal.  Although I was part of the modern Navy, the DTS soundtrack of the movie captures the constant intrusions of sounds at sea; all the squeaks, clanks, snores, footsteps, splashes, wisps and howls of the wind are an ever present character in the film.  Of particular note was the use of the ""chipset,"" a simple device that used knotted line to accurately give the ship's speed in ""knots.""  Also, though easy to miss, there is a scene while the ship is attempting to ""round the Horn"" at the tip of South America, where it shows a sailor using the ""head,"" the nautical term for the toilet on the ship.  If you look carefully as the camera pans from the front to the back of the ship, you'll see a sailor with his pants around his ankles sitting on a holed plank off the front or ""head"" of the ship.  For obvious reasons the head was placed as far as possible from the captain's quarters, the area at the far aft (back) of the ship.Finally, the acting in the movie is exceptional, the battle scenes chaotic, and the cannonball shots impressive. You almost want to duck as the cannonshots approach and tear through the ship.  Whether you buy the DTS encoded DVD or Blu-ray, the battle scenes will impressively exercise your home theater system.",5,Outstanding leadership example with incredible attention to seafaring details,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,1844,"['former', 'naval', 'officer', 'remember', 'sitting', 'showing', 'movie', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'leadership', 'classes', 'movie', 'was', 'used', 'demonstrate', 'contrasting', 'leadership', 'styles', 'Master', 'Commander', 'had', 'been', 'available', 'decades', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'movie', 'demonstrate', 'calm', 'calculating', 'thought', 'often', 'accentuated', 'smile', 'required', 'leader', 'when', 'faced', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'trait', 'beautifully.Leadership', 'aside', 'movie', 'attention', 'seafaring', 'detail', 'phenomenal', 'was', 'part', 'modern', 'Navy', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'constant', 'intrusions', 'sounds', 'sea', 'squeaks', 'clanks', 'snores', 'footsteps', 'splashes', 'wisps', 'howls', 'wind', 'are', 'ever', 'present', 'character', 'film', 'particular', 'note', 'was', 'use', 'chipset', 'simple', 'device', 'used', 'knotted', 'line', 'accurately', 'give', 'ship', 'speed', 'knots', 'Also', 'easy', 'miss', 'scene', 'ship', 'attempting', 'round', 'Horn', 'tip', 'South', 'America', 'where', 'sailor', 'using', 'head', 'nautical', 'term', 'toilet', 'ship', 'look', 'carefully', 'camera', 'front', 'back', 'ship', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sailor', 'pants', 'ankles', 'sitting', 'holed', 'plank', 'front', 'head', 'ship', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'head', 'was', 'placed', 'as', 'far', 'possible', 'captain', 'quarters', 'area', 'far', 'aft', 'back', 'ship.Finally', 'acting', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'battle', 'chaotic', 'cannonball', 'shots', 'impressive', 'almost', 'want', 'duck', 'cannonshots', 'approach', 'tear', 'ship', 'buy', 'DTS', 'encoded', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'battle', 'scenes', 'will', 'impressively', 'exercise', 'home', 'theater', 'system']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Galeano Valencia,"[4, 4]","Director Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) had against him that ""Master and Commmander: The Far Side of the World"" was released the same year that the world was still processing the unfolding marvel of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Had it been otherwise, ""Master and Commander"" would have probably caught much more of the Academy's attention as the truly great film it is. In my opinion, one of the best movies ever.For many connaiuseurs this may be the best-looking film ever made about naval warfare. It is an adaptation of many of the adventures and characters narrated by Patrick O'Brien in his series of naval novels written in the 20th century. Naval experts agree that filmmakers carefully researched ships of this particular historic period and paid extreme attention to naval details, historic settings and naval jargon.The story is simply captivating: it is August 1805 and the Napoleonic Wars are at its best. The HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is stationed off the east coast of Brazil with the mission of stopping the French privateer Acheron. After a first engagement which ends in a near disaster for the Surprise; the French ship escapes.  Thereafter, a chase begins, with the Surprise pursuing the Acheron south through the Atlantic Ocean, around Cape Horn, and through the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands.Underneath the main story line, lies the close and honest friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor (marvelously portrayed by Paul Bettany). If you happen to like the movie I would also very strongly recommend to buy the film's soundtrack. It is a delightful and captivating selection of pieces handpicked to match the greatness of the story. I myself cannot help but to hear in my mind the beautiful notes of Boccherini's ""La musica notturna delle strade di Madrid"" while revisiting the beautiful sea landscapes, breathtaking scenery and spectacular photography of this excellent movie.Simply brilliant!",5,Simply brilliant,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,2014,"['Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'had', 'Master', 'Commmander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'world', 'was', 'still', 'processing', 'unfolding', 'marvel', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Had', 'been', 'otherwise', 'Master', 'Commander', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'caught', 'much', 'more', 'Academy', 'attention', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever.For', 'many', 'connaiuseurs', 'may', 'be', 'best-looking', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'naval', 'warfare', 'adaptation', 'many', 'adventures', 'characters', 'narrated', 'Patrick', ""O'Brien"", 'series', 'naval', 'novels', 'written', '20th', 'century', 'Naval', 'experts', 'agree', 'filmmakers', 'carefully', 'researched', 'ships', 'particular', 'historic', 'period', 'paid', 'extreme', 'attention', 'naval', 'details', 'historic', 'settings', 'naval', 'jargon.The', 'story', 'simply', 'captivating', 'August', '1805', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'are', 'best', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'commanded', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'stationed', 'off', 'east', 'coast', 'Brazil', 'mission', 'stopping', 'French', 'privateer', 'Acheron', 'first', 'engagement', 'near', 'disaster', 'Surprise', 'French', 'ship', 'escapes', 'Thereafter', 'chase', 'Surprise', 'pursuing', 'Acheron', 'south', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'Pacific', 'Galapagos', 'Islands.Underneath', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'close', 'honest', 'friendship', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'ship', 'doctor', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'happen', 'like', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'very', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'delightful', 'captivating', 'selection', 'pieces', 'handpicked', 'match', 'greatness', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'hear', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'notes', 'Boccherini', 'La', 'musica', 'notturna', 'delle', 'strade', 'di', 'Madrid', 'revisiting', 'beautiful', 'sea', 'landscapes', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'photography', 'excellent', 'movie.Simply', 'brilliant']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

748147,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B00008W64E,ribcage,"[1, 2]","Master and Commander is a marvelous film. It is extremely beautiful and in its slavish attention to the detail of life on an early nineteenth century British Navy vessel it is one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen.The film tells the story of Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the H.M.S. Surprise as they attempt to track and destroy an enemy vessel, the superior French boat the Archeron.It is epic, but also intensely personal. For the entirety of the film we see only the events from the viewpoint of the members of the Surprise's crew. Director Peter Weir essentially enlists the audience in Britain's Navy for the two hour runtime. We are there with them for every moment, and like them, we cannot leave. The film feels almost documentary-like both for its intimate approach and for the amount of detail in day to day workings on the ship.There isn't any character development to speak of, but none is needed. We are seeing a ""slice of life"" so we don't need to see Aubrey overcome his near-compulsive oath to duty, nor any other such character revelations.The story is simple, but this movie is written more like a theatrical play where the spotlight is fully on the actors and their characters rather than piling melodramatic events to create an epic.Being confined to just one boat, and with not much more story than a long game of cat and mouse, however, can leave the film feeling slow at times. There were also a few scenes where the jump between scenes was rather awkward, making me feel like I missed something between the two, exactly like when you watch a movie edited for time on television.For an epic that doesn't try to blow it all out on spectacle and intense moments, but stays very realistic throughout and delivers very human characters, look no further than Master and Commander.",4,Master and Commander,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1815,"['Master', 'Commander', 'marvelous', 'film', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'slavish', 'attention', 'detail', 'life', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'British', 'Navy', 'vessel', 'one', 'most', 'immersive', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'film', 'story', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'attempt', 'track', 'destroy', 'enemy', 'vessel', 'superior', 'French', 'boat', 'Archeron.It', 'epic', 'also', 'intensely', 'personal', 'entirety', 'film', 'see', 'only', 'events', 'viewpoint', 'members', 'Surprise', 'crew', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'essentially', 'audience', 'Britain', 'Navy', 'two', 'hour', 'runtime', 'are', 'there', 'moment', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary-like', 'intimate', 'approach', 'amount', 'detail', 'day', 'day', 'workings', 'ship.There', ""n't"", 'character', 'development', 'speak', 'none', 'needed', 'are', 'seeing', 'slice', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Aubrey', 'overcome', 'near-compulsive', 'oath', 'duty', 'other', 'such', 'character', 'revelations.The', 'story', 'simple', 'movie', 'written', 'more', 'theatrical', 'play', 'where', 'spotlight', 'fully', 'actors', 'characters', 'rather', 'piling', 'melodramatic', 'events', 'create', 'epic.Being', 'confined', 'just', 'one', 'boat', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'long', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'however', 'can', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'slow', 'times', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'jump', 'scenes', 'was', 'rather', 'awkward', 'making', 'feel', 'missed', 'something', 'two', 'exactly', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'edited', 'time', 'television.For', 'epic', ""n't"", 'try', 'blow', 'out', 'spectacle', 'intense', 'moments', 'very', 'realistic', 'delivers', 'very', 'human', 'characters', 'look', 'further', 'Master', 'Commander']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

748151,A33U71MQ0QU2KN,B00008W64E,Richard Leveson,"[140, 145]","Those of us who have read the entire series of Patrick O'Brien's books on the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his dear friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin during the Napoleonic wars and have soaked up the atmosphere and sense of history so unfailingly captured in those books, are going to be hard to satisfy with any film representation. So although I have great respect for Peter Weir, I did not have high hopes as I sat down to watch the movie.The opening scenes, of a darkened sea and a silent three-masted 'Surprise', with only night watch on deck and most hands asleep below, gives as true a sense of period as any I could possibly imagine - and captivated me immediately. The attention to detail is remarkable and the handling of the crew; surely one of the most difficult aspects of making such a film; utterly masterful. You can smell the lower deck with the hammocks tight-packed with sleeping, farting, snorting bodies and livestock penned into the same quarters. The battle scenes are stunningly effective and the impact of shot and ball makes you wince in a manner that you'd not think possible in an age where we constantly see violent action and are inured to the sight of exploding flesh. That you could not follow who was who in the melees - or determine quite how the various battles between ships were unfolding - didn't matter, because that is exactly how such actions are in reality. Who knows how many died by friendly fire in the confusion of those hand-to-hand encounters? The percentage must have been sizable, as it is even today.Russel Crowe's performance as the utterly resolute and masterful sailor, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, is truly brilliant. His English accent falters little and he gives the role all the subtlety required of a character whose own subtlety is not immediately evident. Aubrey is a commander who is intensely sensitive to the mood of his crew - knows all their names - and treats them with a rare humanity for the early 19th century Royal Navy. We know he acquired this sense, in part, because as a young midshipman, he was once demoted to the rank of common sailor; and in this experience, came to understand them as few officers could.The disappointment, for me, was in the lack of development of Dr. Maturin's character. In the books, Maturin (played here by Paul Bettany) is in a sense the main character and much of what happens is seen through his eyes. He is an immensely complex man, deeply learned, and with a quaint 18th century manner of speech which contains much Irish mannerism. ""You are to consider"" he will say, or ""I am persuaded that ..."". His turn-out for formal dining occasions is the subject of much affectionate amusement among the crew (for they take pride in him as 'their' learned physician, who cares deeply for his patients) - and vexation for his Commander; for he may appear at dinner in a heavily blood-stained jacket, unwashed for several days, or with his wig awry. He is also evidently a man whose apparent age ""might have been anything between twenty and sixty"" and he is small and ""ill-looking"". He and Jack are total opposites and it is the interplay between the two characters; the great affection they hold for one another, that is the spirit of the books. So I say that I was disappointed that Stephen was not better cast and his character was not more defined. I can however also say that those scenes where the two of them make music together do succeed, by the nature of the music chosen, in coming close to the spirit of the book. I should also emphasize that we cannot blame Paul Bettany for this; the problem lies in the casting and in character development (Paul Bettany looks too young and well-kempt for the part and is given little chance to 'be' Stephen).So on the visual level this is a brilliant film and Crowe is most convincing in his role. Weir has performed a labour of love and has soaked himself in the period and the genre.People who read the books, and say that they cannot get past the vast amount of technical detail, will find no relief in the film.

Set in the early 19th Century during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) and the crew of the British warship HMS Surprise embark on a mission to intercept and destroy the French privateer Acheron. After narrowly escaping their first encounter with heavy damages and casualties, Captain Aubrey continues the pursuit of his powerful adversary into the Pacific Ocean. Directed by Peter Weir (Witness & The Truman Show), ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is an outstanding well-crafted epic movie that successfully combines great storytelling and strong human drama. The visual effects are terrific. The climatic sea battle sequence is thrilling and very entertaining. Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany deliver great performances. ""Master and Commander"" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.The Blu-Ray release of ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" misses its mark. The 2003 war drama is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the DVD but unfortunately it isn't a solid choice to show off your High-Def television. With its fine clarity and thunderous bass, the DTS-HD audio is the real winner in this release. Its only extras are six deleted scenes, a pop-up trivia track and the film's theatrical trailer.

Is Captain Jack obsessed with a  formidable foe? Has he rejected reason for the pursuit for French ship Acheron, his Moby Dick? There are allusions to the albatross and the curse of Jonah. Another neglected theme was the relationship that developed between Lucky Jack and Dr. Stephen Maturin. The doctor has scientific ambitions that would have permitted him to beat Charles Darwin to the punch. However, each time he is promised an opportunity to explore the Galapagos, Captain Jack pulls out to pursue his military duties. The relationship briefly presents the case that our wars have prevented us from progressing as a culture. That could have been cool, but then changes direction. In the end, the cohesive theme is that Captain Jack is a superhero mariner who can do no wrong. Even during his brief displays of obsession, the crew seems to collectively roll their eyes in a knowing manner. Even when overmatched, he cannot lose. And what is the deal with the doctor and captain playing their violin and cello sideways like guitars at the end?

Atlantic in search of the French war ship, Acheron.  The Archeron had been raiding English whalers and seizing their cargo.  Captain ""lucky Jack"" Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has been charged with the taking her a prize or sinking of the Archeron, which he knows will be a difficult job, as the Archeron is a bigger, faster and more heavily armed war ship.The Archeron finds the HMS Suprise first and fires upon her out of a fog bank, killing and injuring many of the crew.  The tale ensues like a cat and mouse game, with each captain trying to get the best of the other.The realism and authenticity in this film is breath taking.  The tight quarters and bad food, combined with the saltyness of the sailors makes one feel like he is actually on board the ship.There is a fond friendship between captain Aubrey and the ship's surgeon, Dr Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  A conflict arises when Dr Maturin wants to go ashore in the Galapagos Islands to study the fauna and capain Jack refuses, however, when Dr Maturin is accidently shot,  Aubrey abandons the chase to give medical attention to his friend on the island.Though they are sailors and soldiers, the men are superstitious and believe one of the ship's officers is a ""Jonah"" and has been bringing them bad luck.  Even the man himself believes it and commits suicide.  Physical punishment here is a reality.  When one of the sailors is given 10 lashes for failing to salute.Director, Peter Weir has done a masterful job making this film work and bringing the viewer back in time to experience life aboard an 1805 English ship of the line.  The realism is truely amazing.  Russell Crowe is an inspiring commander.  I would follow him into battle anywhere.I really enjoyed this film and would like to see others of its kind.

748157,A1HFRNJMWCKXDP,B00008W64E,"Robert E. Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[4, 4]","I watched this movie not expecting much at all.  I though it would be like some over-produced and more bombastic ""Horatio Hornblower"" episode, but to my delight I was pleasantly surprised by a cinematic marvel of a film that uses a great cast, superb visuals and soundtrack with a decent story to provide something for everyone.  That being said I felt the movie was missing the proper exposition needed for a period piece: we find out only too late the record of Jack Aubrey, his relationship and his foibles.  This however, only provides a reason to watch the film again, or again and again.  The film focuses on Captain Aubrey's ship ""HMS Surprise"" voyage around Cape Horn in pursuit of the French ship ""Acheron"" (named for a river in hell, which I don't think is all that realistic but it sure is fun).  But beyond just this chase the film weaves a yarn about the intricate and close knit life on a British ship of the line during the Napoleonic Wars.The film is overwhelmingly realistic as it shows the microcosm of an early 19th century ship at sea with gritty honesty.  Literally seeing the blood sweat and tears of the sailors and the pomp and circumstance of the officers it is easy to see why tension was always high and justice was brutal on the high seas.  Paul Bettany, plays his role well as the ships surgeon who has a penchant for natural science.  The part where he is shot by one of the sailors is somewhat farfetched but it makes the scenes one the Galapagos Islands all the better.  One touching scene is when the young cadet who has had his arm amputated after a battle is given A book about Lord Nelson (who also had an amputated arm). The fighting is magnificently done and the storm scenes are almost too realistic.  This is one of those films you could enjoy even with the sound off.In the end ""Master and Commander"" is a really fun movie: it is not a life changing experience but is enjoyable and worthy of several watches.  Russel Crowe, as he often does, earns his money with his great performance.  The other actors too perform well and this movie has good attention to detail.  I recommend this movie as a great family film for older children as well as anyone with a thirst for adventure.

748160,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00008W64E,Robert Graves,"[3, 3]","In a world of look-a-like movies, ""Master and Commander"" stands strongly apart from the rest. While the temptation would be for the filmmakers to take this to the nautical lows of ""A Perfect Storm"" in an action-ocean-war flick, they made it into a true character movie with remarkable moments of drama, tension, and yes, action.The true stars of ""Master and Commander"" are Russell Crowe (Captain Aubrey) and Paul Bettany (Dr. Maturin). I've loved Bettany in everything he's done - he adds this comfortable tenor to all his films, and in this case he really balances out Crowe's stern Aubrey. We are in 1805, and the film takes place almost entirely at sea, yet never gets boring due to the great character development with Aubrey and Maturin in a classic protagonist/antagonist setup. Aubrey is obsessed with his ship and his mission, to hunt down the French ship Archeron. Its captain, however, is an even match for Aubrey and consistently outwits him.This game of cat and mouse ensues for most of the film, but is nicely counterbalanced by Dr. Maturin, a naturalist, who discovers several new species on the Galapagos Islands using only a telescope as they flank the archipelago. This leads to his insistence that they land there so he can explore further, causing great scenes of tension between the two men.This movie has pretty much everything, though I could see some people feeling it's a little drawn out during the parts of island exploration by Maturin. What you initially think is going to be just a little dip in the storyline quickly turns into one of the major subplots in the film.

It lacks the metaphysical and religious elements, but just as Ahab is pursing his white whale, so does Capt. &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey pursue the French fighting ship Acheron, which is larger, better gunned, and faster than his own H.M.S. Surprise.  This is not a deep movie.  It is not, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, a morality tale.  It is simply an adventure yarn, but as such, it is one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long while.  The movie stars Russell Crowe as Aubrey, and while this isn't one of the more challenging roles he has played, he did his usual stellar job.  Paul Bettany has the second lead as Aubrey's close friend, classical music partner, and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The rest of the cast (including Billy Boyd who I saw earlier today as Pippin in RETURN OF THE KING) is uniformly excellent and makes a fine ensemble cast.  There is one other costar, and that is the ship used to portray the H.M.S. Surprise.  They really went all out in making a perfect recreation of a late 18th century frigate.  I kept thinking about the gigantic number of ropes that seemed to be required to make the ship functional.This is a chase movie.  There is little or no preface and build up to the action.  We are immediately told that the assignment for the Surprise is to find and capture or sink the French ship the Acheron.  The rest of the film consists either the two ships engaging one another, or the Surprise chasing the Acheron.  The substance of the film beyond that consists entirely of the relations between the various members of the crew, with the exception of a trip to the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin, as a naturalist, gets to glimpse the animals that Charles Darwin would make so much of only a couple of decades later on the Beagle.  Apart from some TV documentaries, this is the only movie I can ever remember having seen that was actually shot on location in the Galapagos Islands, and it was, moreover, the only parts of the film shot on dry land.Some serious film buffs might turn their noses up at this film, because it doesn't try to do anything but entertain, but it does that so well, that I would suggest that they think about nose jobs.",5,An absolutely first rate sea yarn,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2236,"[""n't"", 'quite', 'updating', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'metaphysical', 'religious', 'elements', 'just', 'Ahab', 'pursing', 'white', 'whale', 'so', 'Capt', 'quot', 'Lucky', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'pursue', 'French', 'fighting', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'larger', 'better', 'gunned', 'faster', 'own', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'not', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'morality', 'tale', 'simply', 'adventure', 'yarn', 'such', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'movie', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Aubrey', ""n't"", 'one', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'played', 'did', 'usual', 'stellar', 'job', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'second', 'lead', 'Aubrey', 'close', 'friend', 'classical', 'music', 'partner', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'who', 'saw', 'earlier', 'today', 'Pippin', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'KING', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'one', 'other', 'costar', 'ship', 'used', 'portray', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'making', 'perfect', 'recreation', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'frigate', 'kept', 'thinking', 'gigantic', 'number', 'ropes', 'seemed', 'be', 'required', 'make', 'ship', 'functional.This', 'chase', 'movie', 'little', 'preface', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'are', 'immediately', 'told', 'assignment', 'Surprise', 'find', 'capture', 'sink', 'French', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'rest', 'film', 'two', 'ships', 'engaging', 'one', 'Surprise', 'chasing', 'Acheron', 'substance', 'film', 'entirely', 'relations', 'various', 'members', 'crew', 'exception', 'trip', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'where', 'Maturin', 'naturalist', 'glimpse', 'animals', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'would', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'couple', 'decades', 'later', 'Beagle', 'Apart', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'only', 'movie', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'having', 'seen', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'location', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'was', 'moreover', 'only', 'parts', 'film', 'shot', 'dry', 'land.Some', 'serious', 'film', 'buffs', 'might', 'turn', 'noses', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'anything', 'entertain', 'so', 'well', 'would', 'suggest', 'think', 'nose', 'jobs']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748163,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00008W64E,Robert Morris,"[5, 6]","Those who enjoyed the various Horatio Hornblower films (one of which stars Gregory Peck) will especially appreciate this adaptation of material from a series of novels written by Patrick O'Brian. Directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander examines life aboard a British warship during the Napoleonic Wars as it encounters and is battered by a French privateer, the Acheron, and then pursues its enemy from the coast of Brazil southward around Cape Horn to The Galapagos Island until the final, inevitable and decisive encounter. The acting is first-rate, beginning with Crowe but including Paul Bettany (who previously appeared with Crowe in A Perfect Mind) as ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin, and Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney, one of several midshipmen aboard H.M.S. Surprise. Weir brilliantly juxtaposes violent battle scenes at sea with quiet, at times tender moments aboard ship. There is also a fascinating sequence during which Dr. Maturin and two youthful companions leave the ship to gather scientific specimens until unexpectedly....The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, receiving one (Russell Boyd for cinematography). Given the competition, it probably did not deserve others but suggesting that in no way damns with faint praise. (Praises with faint damnation?) This is a delightful, stirring, and on occasion moving account of a charming and resourceful captain and his loyal crew who, when necessary, summon exceptional courage with style and grace. I was surprised to learn how self-sufficient such ships must be, especially in terms of repairing damage resulting from combat. Because all of the film is set aboard the British warship, I also realized how confining, if not claustrophobic it must have seemed at times to crew members. On occasion, I did have a problem catching some of the dialogue but that may be more indicative of my hearing ability (or loss thereof) than of the quality of the soundtrack.

What a mistake.  This movie ought to be seen on the big screen.  Somehow, my TV set did not do justice to Weirs incredible cinematography.Having read almost all of C.F. Foresters Hornblower series, I was wondering if Weir could capture the atmosphere of a 19th century man-of-war.  I was not disappointed.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie was Weirs meticulous attention to detail. It was simply amazing.  Weir captured the nuances of 19th century naval warfare- crowded berths, the rotten food, and constant danger due to accident or war.We can learn much about leadership from Master and Commander.  Leaders are paid to make decisions and many of those decisions are not easy to make- does Aubery rescue the drowning sailor, or risk his crew to save him? He lets the sailor drown.  Leaders just do not make decisions, they must motivate people to follow them.  As Master and Commander, Aubery motivates his crew to do the impossible, engage and defeat a much more powerful enemy.Was this a great movie? Not really.

There is simply no doubt about that.  The viewer is literally transported and immersed into the brutal and harsh service of the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe perfectly portrays Captain Jack Aubrey (""lucky Jack"") of the Patrick O'Brian novels.  The acting, sets, everything, simply crackle with authenticity.  The attention to detail in this film is astounding.The storyline is not bad either, although in my opinion it moves a bit slowly.  But the relatively slow pace of the storyline is for a purpose, to draw the viewer into the subtle nuances that the film is trying to convey--that this was a hard age, the Royal Navy of the times was a brutal and merciless service which brooked no disobedience and yet was not lacking in humanity.  Russell Crowe portrays a Captain Aubrey who is both harsh and humane in an age of hardship and adventure.I deprived this film of the fifth star because I did feel that the storyline could have been made to move at a brisker pace without sacrificing the nuances that the film accomplishes so well.

The two naval battle scenes between the tall ships in the time of Napoleon and the Regency are certainly realistic, frighteningly so.  If this has ever been done better on film, I'm unaware of it.The sailing ships look right, complicated and untidy.  The stunts are perfect, dangerous.  The acting is okay so far as the script allows.  But somehow I wanted to know more about the motivation, especially of the English captain, played by Russell Crowe.  He is dogged in his pursuit of the French enemy, exceeding his orders by pursuing the foe vessel around Cape Horn and far up the west coast of South America.  The action starts in medias res, so we did not get to see the beginning of the voyage--or know how long the crew had been together--or what their motives were.  In short, I think the filmaker needed to move a bit closer inside the men.This is worth seeing for the action and special effects, the same reason the last Titanic film was worth a look.

748171,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00008W64E,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 18]","***1/2 The odd thing about ""Master and Commander"" is that its strengths and its weaknesses both seem to derive from one and the same source: its subtlety.Based on the novels by Patrick O'Brian, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is a seafaring adventure tale more notable, perhaps, for its straight-ahead action sequences than for its finer elements of characterization and conflict.  O'Brian has certainly given writer John Collee and writer/director Peter Weir plenty to work with here, starting with an Ahab-type main character named Jack Aubrey, a British sea captain in 1805 who becomes obsessed with overtaking and attacking a much larger French man-of-war ship that defeated his vessel in battle off the coast of South America.  Aubrey, albeit a man of sensibility and compassion, often endangers the lives of his men in an effort to complete his ""mission,"" even though he is routinely challenged by cooler heads on the ship to acknowledge the fruitlessness of the endeavor and to set sail for home an honorably defeated man.Aubrey is nowhere near as neurotic and delusional as Ahab, and that perhaps is the biggest problem with the film.  Aubrey, for all his bluster, is really not all that interesting a character.  Although we can see where the filmmakers are trying to take us, they never seem able to crack open Aubrey's mind to help us get inside and learn what really makes him tick.  One thing about Ahab is that we always knew why the stakes were so personal for him.  With Aubrey we don't really understand why he is so single-mindedly set on getting his target.  Perhaps the confrontations he has with his crewmen are just a trifle too low-keyed and underplayed to reveal very much about his character.  ""Master and Commander"" may be a more realistic yarn than ""Moby Dick"" but, in this case at least, subtlety comes with a hefty price.  An adventure film set on the high seas needs to hit more dramatic high points than ""Master and Commander"" is eventually able to muster.Having said all that, it seems a bit perverse and paradoxical to now point out that ""Master and Commander"" also draws its greatest strength from the fact that it doesn't rely on cheap melodramatics to achieve its power.  Thanks to outstanding direction, set design and special effects, we really feel as if we are on one of those early 19th Century sailing vessels, a feeling that is enhanced even more in the battle scenes which are executed with a stunning eye for believability and detail.  And there are many moments of silent intensity particularly between Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident naturalist, obviously modeled on Charles Darwin (though 30 years earlier than Darwin), who can't understand why Aubrey has to go off fighting Bonaparte's forces when all Maturin wants is to be able to go traipsing all over the Galapagos Islands in search of new and fascinating faunal specimens (at least Darwin didn't have to contend with some pesky war when he was off developing his Theory of Evolution).  The subtle interplay between these two characters provides for some of the most gripping moments in the film.  Russell Crowe manages to convey both authority and compassion in his role of Aubrey, and Paul Bettany creates a compelling foil for him in Maturnin.  Aubrey is also up against the superstitious nature of his disgruntled crew who attribute much of their troubled journey to the curse laid upon them by a vindictive god (vide ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"").  The filmmakers also do an effective job exploring the internal decision-making process a person in authority often has to go through in weighing the good of the group against the good of the individual.  The fact that Aubrey isn't a raving lunatic (like Ahab) lessens the drama but heightens the verisimilitude of the piece.""Master and Commander"" is a bit of a close call for me, but taken as a whole, its virtues ultimately outweigh its flaws.",3,mixed bag but much to recommend,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,3956,"['odd', 'thing', 'Master', 'Commander', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'seem', 'derive', 'one', 'same', 'source', 'subtlety.Based', 'novels', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'seafaring', 'adventure', 'tale', 'more', 'notable', 'perhaps', 'straight-ahead', 'action', 'sequences', 'finer', 'elements', 'characterization', 'conflict', ""O'Brian"", 'certainly', 'given', 'writer', 'John', 'Collee', 'writer/director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'plenty', 'work', 'here', 'starting', 'Ahab-type', 'main', 'character', 'named', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'British', 'sea', 'captain', '1805', 'who', 'obsessed', 'overtaking', 'attacking', 'much', 'larger', 'French', 'man-of-war', 'ship', 'defeated', 'vessel', 'battle', 'coast', 'South', 'America', 'Aubrey', 'man', 'sensibility', 'compassion', 'often', 'lives', 'men', 'effort', 'complete', 'mission', 'even', 'routinely', 'challenged', 'cooler', 'heads', 'ship', 'acknowledge', 'fruitlessness', 'endeavor', 'set', 'sail', 'home', 'honorably', 'defeated', 'man.Aubrey', 'nowhere', 'near', 'neurotic', 'delusional', 'Ahab', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'Aubrey', 'bluster', 'really', 'not', 'interesting', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'never', 'seem', 'able', 'crack', 'open', 'Aubrey', 'mind', 'help', 'get', 'inside', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'tick', 'One', 'thing', 'Ahab', 'always', 'knew', 'why', 'stakes', 'were', 'so', 'personal', 'Aubrey', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'single-mindedly', 'set', 'getting', 'target', 'Perhaps', 'confrontations', 'crewmen', 'are', 'just', 'trifle', 'too', 'low-keyed', 'underplayed', 'reveal', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'Master', 'Commander', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'yarn', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'case', 'least', 'subtlety', 'hefty', 'price', 'adventure', 'film', 'set', 'high', 'seas', 'needs', 'hit', 'more', 'dramatic', 'high', 'points', 'Master', 'Commander', 'eventually', 'able', 'muster.Having', 'said', 'bit', 'perverse', 'paradoxical', 'now', 'point', 'out', 'Master', 'Commander', 'also', 'greatest', 'strength', 'fact', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cheap', 'melodramatics', 'achieve', 'power', 'Thanks', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'one', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'sailing', 'vessels', 'feeling', 'enhanced', 'even', 'more', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'executed', 'stunning', 'eye', 'believability', 'detail', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'silent', 'intensity', 'particularly', 'Aubrey', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'resident', 'naturalist', 'obviously', 'modeled', 'Charles', 'Darwin', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'Darwin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Aubrey', 'go', 'off', 'fighting', 'Bonaparte', 'forces', 'when', 'Maturin', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'traipsing', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'search', 'new', 'fascinating', 'faunal', 'specimens', 'least', 'Darwin', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'contend', 'pesky', 'war', 'when', 'was', 'off', 'developing', 'Theory', 'Evolution', 'subtle', 'interplay', 'two', 'characters', 'most', 'gripping', 'moments', 'film', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'convey', 'authority', 'compassion', 'role', 'Aubrey', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'compelling', 'foil', 'Maturnin', 'Aubrey', 'also', 'up', 'superstitious', 'nature', 'disgruntled', 'crew', 'who', 'attribute', 'much', 'troubled', 'journey', 'curse', 'laid', 'vindictive', 'god', 'Rime', 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'do', 'effective', 'job', 'exploring', 'internal', 'decision-making', 'process', 'person', 'authority', 'often', 'go', 'weighing', 'good', 'group', 'good', 'individual', 'fact', 'Aubrey', ""n't"", 'raving', 'lunatic', 'Ahab', 'drama', 'verisimilitude', 'piece', 'Master', 'Commander', 'bit', 'close', 'call', 'taken', 'whole', 'virtues', 'ultimately', 'outweigh', 'flaws']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748172,A1CSOUJBFJJZGF,B00008W64E,"Rowena Ravenscroft ""Interested teacher""","[13, 18]","I agree with every good thing that's been said about this film here by customers, but I have one caveat.  If you are a fan of the novels, as I am, you will likely be dissatisfied with the movie, not because it isn't a great film, which it is, but because it does a SEVERE lack of justice to the books.  And it's additionally annoying because Peter Weir got the hard stuff right, and the easy stuff wrong.  Russell Crowe was as perfect as probably possible for Jack Aubrey, but Paul Bettany was jaw-droppingly, unbelieveably wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Because of that, the script also had to be all wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Maturin is supposed to be tiny, dark, and ugly--he is half Irish and half Catalan Spanish.  He is physically uncoordinated and has a rather sour secretive disposition, with a tendency toward depression.  Because of the latter he is a drug addict.  But he is a fantastically erudite physician and polyglot, and a very successful spy for the British government.  The Patrick O'Brian books are just as much about the spying adventures of Maturin as they are about the sailing adventures of Aubrey, but because Paul Bettany could not possibly be convincing as anything more than a physician who doesn't know much about ships, half of what's good about the books had to be excised.  That is unfortunate, because the two characters have their own strengths and weaknesses and complement each other perfectly.  Read the books--they are far better.  And I guess we'll just have to wait for the BBC to do a series of movies a la Horatio Hornblower before anything like justice gets done to the books on film.",4,"Excellent film, but.....",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,1626,"['agree', 'good', 'thing', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'here', 'customers', 'have', 'one', 'caveat', 'are', 'fan', 'novels', 'am', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'movie', 'not', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'SEVERE', 'lack', 'justice', 'books', 'additionally', 'annoying', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'got', 'hard', 'stuff', 'right', 'easy', 'stuff', 'wrong', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'as', 'perfect', 'probably', 'possible', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'was', 'jaw-droppingly', 'unbelieveably', 'wrong', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'script', 'also', 'had', 'be', 'wrong', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Maturin', 'supposed', 'be', 'tiny', 'dark', 'ugly', 'half', 'Irish', 'half', 'Catalan', 'Spanish', 'physically', 'uncoordinated', 'rather', 'sour', 'secretive', 'disposition', 'tendency', 'depression', 'latter', 'drug', 'addict', 'fantastically', 'erudite', 'physician', 'polyglot', 'very', 'successful', 'spy', 'British', 'government', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'books', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'spying', 'adventures', 'Maturin', 'are', 'sailing', 'adventures', 'Aubrey', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'convincing', 'anything', 'more', 'physician', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'ships', 'half', 'what', 'good', 'books', 'had', 'be', 'excised', 'unfortunate', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'complement', 'other', 'perfectly', 'Read', 'books', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'BBC', 'do', 'series', 'movies', 'la', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'anything', 'justice', 'done', 'books', 'film']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

748183,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B00008W64E,Sarah Schenkkan,"[13, 14]","Even from the very first preview of Russell Crowe's new nautical blockbuster, I had high hopes, and the much anticipated release didn't lead me, or audiences astray. Set much aboard the English ship ""H.M.S. Suprise"", it follows the story of Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Crowe), and his faithful crew, on a mission to capture and destroy a superior French cruiser tracking them during the Napoleonic Wars. When the French launch a suprise attack against the Suprise, badly damaging the ship and injuring much of the crew, Captain Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he embarks on a journey across two oceans to seek revenge. The stakes run high; the mission's success could preserve the Suprise and its crew as heroes, but on the other hand, it could cost them all their lives. From the coast of Brazil, to the tumultous Cape Horn to the icy waters of the Far Side of the World (hence, the title) it all draws closer to the climatic sea battle between the French, and Captain Jack.In my opinion, the performances in this film are wonderful, considering they could have easily been overdone. As the rough and troubled Captain, Russell Crowe shows the true range of his talents, from the way he yells orders, to his expressions and faraway look in his eyes as he weighs the difficult decisions at hand. As the ship's doctor Stephen Maturin, Paul Bettany is equally as good, adapting to his character, and the thoughts and feelings that come with it, with an natural ease that only the best of the best possess. The duo who also appeared in last years ""A Beautiful Mind"", play up their chemistry again in this film, which adds to the splendor onscreen.""Master and Commander"" is certainly one of this year's most decadent films, much of it owed to director Peter Weir. A three-time Oscar nominee, he brings to the screen a realistic depiction of life aboard a navy vessel in the 1800s, with a style and grace all his own. The cinematography is jaw-dropping, and the choices in shots during sea battles and aerial views of the wide open oceans give it a whole new dimension. Every cannon shell hitting and splintering the deck is heard, and you can almost taste the salty air on your tongue as you are gloriously transported back into the naval world during the Napoleonic Wars. Although it has some gory surgery scenes to turn even the strongest of stomachs, this film is truly a masterpiece, and recommended for all ages.",4,"Artful ""Master"" Commands The Screen",1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,2427,"['Even', 'very', 'first', 'preview', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'new', 'nautical', 'blockbuster', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'much', 'anticipated', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'audiences', 'astray', 'Set', 'much', 'English', 'ship', 'H.M.S', 'Suprise', 'story', 'Captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Crowe', 'faithful', 'crew', 'mission', 'capture', 'destroy', 'superior', 'French', 'cruiser', 'tracking', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'When', 'French', 'launch', 'suprise', 'attack', 'Suprise', 'badly', 'damaging', 'ship', 'injuring', 'much', 'crew', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'torn', 'duty', 'friendship', 'journey', 'two', 'oceans', 'seek', 'revenge', 'stakes', 'run', 'high', 'mission', 'success', 'could', 'preserve', 'Suprise', 'crew', 'heroes', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'cost', 'lives', 'coast', 'Brazil', 'tumultous', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'icy', 'waters', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'hence', 'title', 'closer', 'climatic', 'sea', 'battle', 'French', 'Captain', 'Jack.In', 'opinion', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'considering', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'overdone', 'rough', 'troubled', 'Captain', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'true', 'range', 'talents', 'way', 'orders', 'expressions', 'faraway', 'look', 'eyes', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'hand', 'ship', 'doctor', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'adapting', 'character', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'come', 'natural', 'ease', 'only', 'best', 'best', 'possess', 'duo', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'last', 'years', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'play', 'up', 'chemistry', 'again', 'film', 'splendor', 'onscreen', 'Master', 'Commander', 'certainly', 'one', 'year', 'most', 'decadent', 'films', 'much', 'owed', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'three-time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'screen', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'life', 'navy', 'vessel', '1800s', 'style', 'grace', 'own', 'cinematography', 'jaw-dropping', 'choices', 'shots', 'sea', 'battles', 'aerial', 'views', 'wide', 'open', 'oceans', 'give', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'cannon', 'shell', 'hitting', 'splintering', 'deck', 'heard', 'can', 'almost', 'taste', 'salty', 'air', 'tongue', 'are', 'gloriously', 'transported', 'back', 'naval', 'world', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'gory', 'surgery', 'scenes', 'turn', 'even', 'strongest', 'stomachs', 'film', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'recommended', 'ages']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

The thing is, Capt. Jack is obsessed.We have various relationships occurring on board; we get to know the men as they fight against weather and against becalmed conditions and as well shrapnel from well-placed cannon fire from the Acheron.What makes the movie great is how the captain has to decide between his duty,  his ship and the men aboard, even if it means some have to die in order for the ship to be saved.  He does not take these lightly and it adds to the drama and suspense.  A man is caught on a mast as it crashes into the ocean.  Because of the storm conditions, the ship is anchored.  He has to cut the mast free but that will mean the death of the survivor in the water.  Tough decision.This movie is fairly realistic - an arm cut off from a 12 year old boy is especially hard to watch.  The doctor is a scientist as well and has a good relationship with the captain, though this is strained when the captain decides to break his promise to the doctor to explore the Galapagos Islands in favor of the chase for the frigate.If it were not for the year 1805 or the trappings of the time, I could easily see this story as a Star Trek episode, chasing the enemy despite everything for God and country.Favorite scenes include the realistic battles between frigate and the HMS Surprise, a chat about Lord Nelson and his demand for salt, and the clever French in how they disguise their captain which I thought was simply hilarious.  There's a lot of medical procedures too that are at times hard to watch!Bottom Line:  Russell Crowe makes a stern, calm yet determined sea captain - this is a must-see film.  It's visceral, the mood of the period is flawlessly captured, and you find yourself rooting for the British!  This film is based on the books by Patrick O'Brien.

Sounds like a very boring premise, right? Wrong! Director Peter Weir has done an outstanding job in creating an exciting atmosphere and hooking the viewer throughout the duration of the film.It is April 1805 and Napoleon has only one last barrier to cross in order to rule over Europe: the British Fleet. Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) is the captain of the Surprise, an English ship sailing in the north coast of Brazil, when the Acheron, a French ship that outclasses them in speed and weaponry, attacks them. The Surprise, which was surprised by the Acheron, was saved by miracle of the fog, were they lost themselves preventing their doom. Now Lucky Jack has to decide whether to return home for repairs and reinforcements, or go after the aggressor and try to defeat this dangerous enemy. Obviously, Jack chooses the latter path, even against the advice of some of his nearest officers in rank.One of the aspects that make this movie extremely interesting is that it reveals the way of living aboard a battle ship in the beginning of the nineteenth century. For example, the audience gets to see the relationship forged between these men and the rules of honor that determine their conduct. Among these rules, we can observe that the value of friendship is paramount.This production of epic magnitude delivers what it promises: action, glorious settings, impeccable performances and a nail biting chase between to ships that become archrivals. In some aspects, the relationship between Lucky Jack and the Acheron reminds me of the one between Captain Ahab and Moby Dick. Finally, if you ever watched the America's Cup and rejoiced in the strategy that it entails, you will find yourself pleased with the amount of strategy involved in this battle too.",5,"""A home in the far side of the world""",1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,1895,"['Imagine', 'movie', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'only', 'confrontation', 'two', 'ships', 'coast', 'South', 'America', 'very', 'boring', 'premise', 'right', 'Wrong', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'creating', 'exciting', 'atmosphere', 'hooking', 'viewer', 'duration', 'film.It', 'April', '1805', 'Napoleon', 'only', 'one', 'last', 'barrier', 'cross', 'order', 'rule', 'Europe', 'British', 'Fleet', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'captain', 'Surprise', 'English', 'ship', 'sailing', 'north', 'coast', 'Brazil', 'when', 'Acheron', 'French', 'ship', 'speed', 'weaponry', 'Surprise', 'was', 'surprised', 'Acheron', 'was', 'saved', 'miracle', 'fog', 'were', 'lost', 'preventing', 'doom', 'Now', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'decide', 'return', 'home', 'repairs', 'reinforcements', 'go', 'aggressor', 'try', 'defeat', 'dangerous', 'enemy', 'Obviously', 'Jack', 'latter', 'path', 'even', 'advice', 'nearest', 'officers', 'rank.One', 'aspects', 'make', 'movie', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'way', 'living', 'battle', 'ship', 'beginning', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'example', 'audience', 'see', 'relationship', 'forged', 'men', 'rules', 'honor', 'determine', 'conduct', 'rules', 'can', 'observe', 'value', 'friendship', 'paramount.This', 'production', 'epic', 'magnitude', 'delivers', 'what', 'action', 'glorious', 'settings', 'impeccable', 'performances', 'nail', 'biting', 'chase', 'ships', 'become', 'archrivals', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Acheron', 'one', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Finally', 'ever', 'watched', 'America', 'Cup', 'rejoiced', 'strategy', 'will', 'find', 'pleased', 'amount', 'strategy', 'involved', 'battle', 'too']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

Where's his wig? Maturin always wore a wig. Second, the character was supposed to be Irish, and quite a bit more eccentric than he is portrayed in the film. This Maturin was quite normal, and even rather dull. Hmmm... Not how I envisioned this character.

As Captain Jack Aubrey, Crowe plays the Commanding officer of the British vessel the HMS Surprise.  Severely damaged by a new and more militarily advanced French warship, Aubrey must choose whether to abandon his mission and repair his ship, or do the best he can and seek revenge.  As expected, Crowe's performance was excellent.  He plays the role of an early 19th century naval Captain extremely well.  A second standout performance was delivered by Paul Bettany who played the ship's doctor;  He was definitely the character I sympathized with the most and Bettany should be lauded for his performace.The strength of this movie resides in it's intense realism.  From the setting, to the manner in which life onboard a 19th century vessel is portrayed, to the carnage and gruesomeness of the battles, this film did a remarkable job of recreating an authentic atmosphere to make the viewer believe he or she is actually watching 19th century naval history.

748196,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00008W64E,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[24, 24]","A friend of mine and I have a tradition of seeing every film that has an Oscar nomination before the Academy Awards are aired, so we've been blitzkrieging the cinemas in our area, trying to see them all. I am so glad that &quot;Master and Commander&quot; was nominated, because I'm not sure if I would have otherwise bothered to see it. What a fantastic film!As someone who has had 3-near drowning experiences and who makes it a priority to not only avoid the water, but films involving water where people might drown, I am not much into seafaring films. Nothing about living on a stinky boat for months on end without modern medical care appeals to my interest... but this film had me on the edge of my seat. I was so quickly drawn into this film; it was more than just a story, but truly an experience. I felt as though I was a member of the crew of the HMS Surprise in 1805.The HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is on a mission to intercept the French warship, the &quot;Archeron.&quot;  The resourceful crew ranges from elderly sea salts probably in their late 60s, to the youngest crewmember who looks to be all of 12 or 13 years old.Their first encounter with the Archeron in heavy fog is quick and deadly. Many crewmen on the Surprise are killed or injured, and the youngest of the crew, Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), receives a broken arm in the battle, which results in amputation without the luxury of modern medicine or anesthetic. Pirkis's performance is breathtaking. Expect to see this young man many more times in the future. The ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany - Crowe's co-star from &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;), is a loyal, but opinionated friend of Captain Aubrey. He serves as Aubrey's friend, motivator and muse, but he does put their friendship to the test on more than one occasion.While there is blood and violence, the most memorable feeling is one of being overwhelmed and engaged by the experience. The &quot;F-word&quot; was used once, but other than that, there is no real foul language, nudity or suggestive scenes and I believe the PG-13 rating is appropriate.During their first encounter, the Surprise must limp away in dense fog to escape with their lives, and although they hit the Archeron with cannon balls and musket fire, they hardly raise a splinter on the larger, faster, thicker hulled ship. Dr. Maturin claims it is pride, but Aubrey insists that it is duty and loyalty to England that is driving him to engage the Archeron again... a ship that appears to outgun them and outclass them in every way.Aubrey proves that he is a brilliant battle commander and manages to outwit the Archeron captain, who appears to be his equal in brinksmanship and cunning.Their Pacific journey forces them to the coast of South America to trade tools for livestock and foodstuffs... and many of the crew pick up a parrot or a squirrel monkey along the way. The ship is driven south in heavy snow and ice, then north again to a windless, rainless, utterly hot and humid region of the see that drives the men crazy.  They turn on a less-than-capable crewmate who does not take the pressure well, as they believe he is the personification of the Biblical Jonah and must be toss overboard to save them from God's wrath. They go the Galapagos Islands to repair damage to their ship from another encounter with the Archeron. There are so many exquisite, incredible things along their journey, it is truly breath taking. Little things that would have been omitted in a lesser film, such as the attention to detail in repairing the ship, including chiseling and patching up the maiden gracing their stern, make this a film worth savoring.It has been a long time since I have felt so &quot;in&quot; a film - I could almost smell the salt air and feel the sea spray on my face. The friend I saw the film with reported feeling the same about this cinematic experience. While seafaring voyages do little to evoke my interest, I was totally engaged in every aspect and moment of this film - less like a voyeur, but rather a crewmember in the shadows, observing and participating. This is how a film should be made.Director Peter Weir is no stranger to filmmaking. He has directed such hits as &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; and &quot;Witness,&quot; but this is clearly his masterpiece.  If you've been putting off this film for any reason, do not delay. Seeing it on the big screen is preferable - being surrounded by the empty calm sea, or deluged in waves, helps to enhance the experience that much more.",5,Masterful and engaging,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,4608,"['friend', 'mine', 'have', 'tradition', 'seeing', 'film', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'aired', ""'ve"", 'been', 'blitzkrieging', 'cinemas', 'area', 'trying', 'see', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'quot', 'Master', 'Commander', 'quot', 'was', 'nominated', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'bothered', 'see', 'What', 'fantastic', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'had', '3-near', 'drowning', 'experiences', 'who', 'priority', 'not', 'only', 'avoid', 'water', 'films', 'involving', 'water', 'where', 'people', 'might', 'drown', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'seafaring', 'films', 'Nothing', 'living', 'stinky', 'boat', 'months', 'end', 'modern', 'medical', 'care', 'appeals', 'interest', 'film', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'was', 'so', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'truly', 'experience', 'felt', 'was', 'member', 'crew', 'HMS', 'Surprise', '1805.The', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'command', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'mission', 'intercept', 'French', 'warship', 'quot', 'Archeron.', 'quot', 'resourceful', 'crew', 'elderly', 'sea', 'salts', 'probably', 'late', '60s', 'youngest', 'crewmember', 'who', 'be', '12', '13', 'years', 'old.Their', 'first', 'encounter', 'Archeron', 'heavy', 'fog', 'quick', 'deadly', 'Many', 'crewmen', 'Surprise', 'are', 'killed', 'injured', 'youngest', 'crew', 'Midshipman', 'Blakeney', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'broken', 'arm', 'battle', 'results', 'amputation', 'luxury', 'modern', 'medicine', 'anesthetic', 'Pirkis', 'performance', 'breathtaking', 'Expect', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'future', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Crowe', 'co-star', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'loyal', 'opinionated', 'friend', 'Captain', 'Aubrey', 'Aubrey', 'friend', 'motivator', 'muse', 'put', 'friendship', 'test', 'more', 'one', 'occasion.While', 'blood', 'violence', 'most', 'memorable', 'feeling', 'one', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'engaged', 'experience', 'quot', 'F-word', 'quot', 'was', 'used', 'once', 'other', 'real', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'believe', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'appropriate.During', 'first', 'encounter', 'Surprise', 'must', 'limp', 'away', 'dense', 'fog', 'escape', 'lives', 'hit', 'Archeron', 'cannon', 'balls', 'musket', 'fire', 'hardly', 'raise', 'splinter', 'larger', 'faster', 'thicker', 'hulled', 'ship', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'pride', 'Aubrey', 'duty', 'loyalty', 'England', 'driving', 'engage', 'Archeron', 'again', 'ship', 'outgun', 'outclass', 'way.Aubrey', 'brilliant', 'battle', 'commander', 'manages', 'outwit', 'Archeron', 'captain', 'who', 'be', 'equal', 'brinksmanship', 'cunning.Their', 'Pacific', 'journey', 'forces', 'coast', 'South', 'America', 'trade', 'tools', 'livestock', 'foodstuffs', 'many', 'crew', 'up', 'parrot', 'squirrel', 'monkey', 'way', 'ship', 'driven', 'south', 'heavy', 'snow', 'ice', 'then', 'north', 'again', 'windless', 'rainless', 'utterly', 'hot', 'humid', 'region', 'see', 'men', 'crazy', 'turn', 'less-than-capable', 'crewmate', 'who', 'not', 'take', 'pressure', 'well', 'believe', 'personification', 'Biblical', 'Jonah', 'must', 'be', 'toss', 'overboard', 'save', 'God', 'wrath', 'go', 'Galapagos', 'Islands', 'repair', 'damage', 'ship', 'encounter', 'Archeron', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'exquisite', 'incredible', 'things', 'journey', 'truly', 'breath', 'taking', 'Little', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'lesser', 'film', 'such', 'attention', 'detail', 'repairing', 'ship', 'including', 'chiseling', 'patching', 'up', 'maiden', 'gracing', 'stern', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'savoring.It', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'felt', 'so', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'could', 'almost', 'smell', 'salt', 'air', 'feel', 'sea', 'spray', 'face', 'friend', 'saw', 'film', 'reported', 'feeling', 'same', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'seafaring', 'voyages', 'do', 'little', 'evoke', 'interest', 'was', 'totally', 'engaged', 'aspect', 'moment', 'film', 'less', 'voyeur', 'rather', 'crewmember', 'shadows', 'observing', 'participating', 'how', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made.Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'stranger', 'filmmaking', 'directed', 'such', 'hits', 'quot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'quot', 'quot', 'Witness', 'quot', 'clearly', 'masterpiece', ""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'film', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'delay', 'Seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'preferable', 'being', 'surrounded', 'empty', 'calm', 'sea', 'deluged', 'waves', 'enhance', 'experience', 'much', 'more']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

748199,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B00008W64E,Simon Crowe,"[3, 3]","MASTER AND COMMANDER is a film inspired by Patrick O'Brian's 20 novels about the British navy during the Napoleonic wars. I was recently talking with a man who, like me, is a great fan of the books. He was aghast that the filmmakers had had the nerve to combine plots from different novels and change the identity of the villains (from American to French)!  Well, it's true the film's storyline is cobbled together, but whether you're a fan or coming to this material for the first time, you'll get a film true to the spirit of the books.Director Peter Weir makes almost no concessions to the audience. Almost immediately we're watching Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and the crew of the SURPRISE clear the decks for action. Indeed, most of the film involves Jack's pursuit of the French ship ACHERON that cripples the SURPRISE in the opening battle. Weir, like O'Brian in the books, puts us right in the middle. We get a sense of the work required to kepp the ship afloat, the close quarters, and the brotherhood of the men.Russell Crowe is terrific here, I can't think of another star of his magnitude who would have been right for the role. Matching him as surgeon and Jack's friend Stephen Maturin is Paul Bettany, who deserves an Oscar nom for the scene where he performs surgery on himself. There's a brief detour to the Galapagos Islands where Maturin, naturalist, collects specimens until his trip is cut short.MASTER AND COMMANDER is a wonderful, intelligent epic made in the spirit of its source material.

I wasn't expecting to be gripped and captivated as much as I was. This is set during the Napoleonic wars and follows an English ship as it is chased and as it chases a French warship of superior size and strength. This basic premise may seem rather staid, but this has so much tension, as the cat and mouse game is played out, that the just over two hour duration goes by in the blink of an eye.This conjures up the tensions, fears and excitements of life on the high seas and offers a fascinating look at life onboard one of these ships, from the captains table to the men on deck. You will enjoy the rough camaraderie and carousing amongst the crew, as well as the superstitions and cabin fever long stretches at sea engenders.This film is shot very well and you are quickly pitched into the cramped and close quarters of life onboard. You see how the men live and fight and the hierarchy onboard as well. All the accents are `most frightfully British' and whilst it seemed mildly annoying at the start, it very quickly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Crow acts surprisingly well in this film and you can feel his charisma and drive as a captain throughout.

748205,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00008W64E,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[2, 3]","Just when you'd think we'd had enough movies about the history of Europe--geez, already, is this the only continent in the world besides North America?--along comes ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World,"" a ripping sea yarn worthy of C.S. Forester.  Though it lifts quite a bit from Forester's ""Horatio Hornblower"" novels--and the TV series, ""Star Trek,"" which was inspired in part by Hornblower--Peter Weir's film production is quite satisfying.  Russell Crowe continues to move up the acting food chain, steadfastly commanding both ship and screen as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, a character few contemporary actors could inhabit.  Crowe, a legitimate movie star, appears to relish the role nearly every boy dreams of some day having--heroic sea captain.  The story is reminiscent of the second Star Trek film, as Aubrey's H.M.S. Surprise (a la Enterprise) battles a mysterious French raider that initially leaves his ship crippled and then plays a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the survivors (a la Star Trek II).  Crewed by both boys and men (wonderfully played by all involved), the Surprise is out-of-date technology (a la Star Trek II) but with the help of the ship's doctor (a la Dr. McCoy), Aubrey trades blows with his deadly opponent.  The entire production is topnotch, with a keen eye to such details as the proper salute for the early 19th century and the relative youth of the ship's officers, the only flaw being a battle tactic that is forecasted so clumsily even people stepping out to use the restroom would figure it out.  Still, a sequel is definitely called for--and Weir and Crowe should continue to make worthy films like this one.",5,A Great Sea Tale,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1670,"['Just', 'when', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'movies', 'history', 'Europe', 'geez', 'already', 'only', 'continent', 'world', 'North', 'America', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'ripping', 'sea', 'yarn', 'worthy', 'C.S', 'Forester', 'quite', 'bit', 'Forester', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'novels', 'TV', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'inspired', 'part', 'Hornblower', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'film', 'production', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'move', 'up', 'acting', 'food', 'chain', 'steadfastly', 'commanding', 'ship', 'screen', 'Captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'character', 'few', 'contemporary', 'actors', 'could', 'inhabit', 'Crowe', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'star', 'relish', 'role', 'nearly', 'boy', 'dreams', 'day', 'having', 'heroic', 'sea', 'captain', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'second', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'Aubrey', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'la', 'Enterprise', 'mysterious', 'French', 'raider', 'initially', 'ship', 'crippled', 'then', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'survivors', 'la', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Crewed', 'boys', 'men', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'involved', 'Surprise', 'out-of-date', 'technology', 'la', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'help', 'ship', 'doctor', 'la', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'Aubrey', 'blows', 'deadly', 'opponent', 'entire', 'production', 'topnotch', 'keen', 'eye', 'such', 'details', 'proper', 'salute', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'relative', 'youth', 'ship', 'officers', 'only', 'flaw', 'being', 'battle', 'tactic', 'forecasted', 'so', 'clumsily', 'even', 'people', 'stepping', 'use', 'restroom', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'Still', 'sequel', 'definitely', 'called', 'Weir', 'Crowe', 'should', 'continue', 'make', 'worthy', 'films', 'one']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748206,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00008W64E,Steve Douglas,"[7, 7]","Why this film did not win the Academy Award for best sound editing is beyond me.  The initial release of Master and Commander on Standard DVDs contained DTS Audio which is relatively rare for most non Blu Ray DVDs and the production on the Standard DVD version was really quite good.  The Blu Ray version simply raises the bar and does it outstandingly.  I never like to summarize story lines as some do.  I am only really interested in the quality of the disc.  A viewer can determine for themselves the quality of the plot and acting.  The video transfer on Blu Ray is quite excellent with deep rich colors and great details in the dark and shadowy areas.  No complaints here at all.  There are plenty of extras but, for me , the most important are the deleted scenes.  Sometimes the deleted scenes really deserve to be a part of an 'extended' version.  However, is was plain to me that these deleted scenes were justifiably cut from the theatrical release.  Some of the deleted scenes were redundant aerial shots that would have added nothing more to the film than the aerials already included in the release.  Some of these same scenes, and others, were clearly not finished in post production as some of them are the only scenes where you can notice blown out whites and artifacting in the water.  Other deleted scenes were interesting in that they further showed parts of the life of the crew's daily life or, in one scene, an extended build up to the movies flogging scene.  That this one was cut didn't seem to matter to me but it is also one that could have been included in the release.As I stated previously, it is the rare release where the Audio shares top billing with the video transfer. The DTS HD audio stands as one of, if not the best, of my growing Blu Ray collection replacing the standard DVDs I own.  Incredible and appropriate use of all 5 channels makes you feel as if you were on the ship itself. Yes, the battle scenes explode all around you as the cannons give a great workout for your sub woofer.  However, it is even in the quiet scenes below deck where the surrounds are still used to a great amount.  I have been on dive ships for most of the last 30 years and have grown accustomed to the sounds of a ship's creaking, anchoring chains and other ambient noise and the audio in Master and Commander replicates that audio ambience like no other I have seen or heard.  You really are immersed in the ship's hold with the rest of the crew as they eat and talk amongst themselves. The creaking and unseen tapping of metal on metal or silverware on plates comes through and envelopes you as if you were on board yourself.  Even the musical duets on cello and fiddle are beautifully spread across the sound stage with the cello on the left channel, spread across the center to the fiddle on the right channel with musical ambience across the rears.I just can't imagine any one being disappointed in the quality of the video and audio transfer.  They are that good and are only limited by the quality of your home theater to reproduce what the Blu Ray version provides.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Master and Commander on Blu Ray,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,3434,"['Why', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'sound', 'editing', 'initial', 'release', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Standard', 'DVDs', 'contained', 'DTS', 'Audio', 'relatively', 'rare', 'most', 'non', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVDs', 'production', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'simply', 'bar', 'outstandingly', 'never', 'summarize', 'story', 'lines', 'do', 'am', 'only', 'really', 'interested', 'quality', 'disc', 'viewer', 'can', 'determine', 'quality', 'plot', 'acting', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'quite', 'excellent', 'deep', 'rich', 'colors', 'great', 'details', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'areas', 'complaints', 'here', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'most', 'important', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Sometimes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'really', 'deserve', 'be', 'part', ""'extended"", 'version', 'However', 'was', 'plain', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'justifiably', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'release', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'redundant', 'aerial', 'shots', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'nothing', 'more', 'film', 'aerials', 'already', 'included', 'release', 'same', 'scenes', 'others', 'were', 'clearly', 'not', 'finished', 'post', 'production', 'are', 'only', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'notice', 'blown', 'out', 'whites', 'artifacting', 'water', 'Other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'further', 'showed', 'parts', 'life', 'crew', 'daily', 'life', 'one', 'scene', 'extended', 'build', 'movies', 'flogging', 'scene', 'one', 'was', 'cut', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'also', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'release.As', 'stated', 'previously', 'rare', 'release', 'where', 'Audio', 'shares', 'top', 'billing', 'video', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'HD', 'audio', 'stands', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'growing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'collection', 'replacing', 'standard', 'DVDs', 'own', 'Incredible', 'appropriate', 'use', '5', 'channels', 'feel', 'were', 'ship', 'Yes', 'battle', 'explode', 'around', 'cannons', 'give', 'great', 'workout', 'sub', 'woofer', 'However', 'even', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'deck', 'where', 'surrounds', 'are', 'still', 'used', 'great', 'amount', 'have', 'been', 'dive', 'ships', 'most', 'last', '30', 'years', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'sounds', 'ship', 'creaking', 'anchoring', 'chains', 'other', 'ambient', 'noise', 'audio', 'Master', 'Commander', 'audio', 'ambience', 'other', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'really', 'are', 'immersed', 'ship', 'hold', 'rest', 'crew', 'eat', 'talk', 'amongst', 'creaking', 'unseen', 'tapping', 'metal', 'metal', 'silverware', 'plates', 'envelopes', 'were', 'board', 'Even', 'musical', 'duets', 'cello', 'fiddle', 'are', 'beautifully', 'spread', 'sound', 'stage', 'cello', 'left', 'channel', 'spread', 'center', 'fiddle', 'right', 'channel', 'musical', 'ambience', 'rears.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'one', 'being', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'transfer', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'only', 'limited', 'quality', 'home', 'theater', 'reproduce', 'what', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'provides.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

What it doesn't offer is a particularly compelling story. The rather thin plot blends two novels by Patrick O'Brian, and most of both of them seems to be missing. This film, I guess, isn't about telling a story - it's about recreating life aboard an English naval vessel in 1805, and on that count it succeeds brilliantly, not only in the vividly realised physical details and extraordinary battles, but in the group psychology of men. Still, the central relationship between Captain Aubrey (Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin (Bettany) doesn't go much beyond the &quot;morality vs. duty&quot; cliche - the story doesn't give it a chance to. Overall, this isn't a five-star affair. For all its big-budget realization, it offers little more than a good episode of LWT's &quot;Hornblower&quot;. Actually, I think it offers a bit less.

Go in with an open mind ready to receive a favorable impression!Why this plea?!?! Well, I was quite depressed when my 20-something year old friends panned the movie & said it was one of the worst ever.If you are brand new to O'Brian & his works, then it may help for you to understand a few things. O'Brian was a tireless historian & naturalist. Every battle in his books (not those in the movie, though) were battles that really happened with the 19th century British Navy. All the details of the ship build, the meals eaten, the language, the countries visited, etc. are all true to the times. And, thankfully, the movie has been very faithful to this detail.However, I think my friends were confusing the glimpse we get at this distant culture with their modern day version of life. For instance, in the movie the captain makes a truly shameless pun which WAS said at the time...it shows you the kind of humor the sailors used to get through their tough life. However, my friends took that to be the humor of the movie itself, which is a very different thing. The humor in the script is a very subtle one based on character development & understanding.So, that all said, I think the movie was absolutely fantastic. You have to pay attention some to see where minor characters are developed, where dialogue is important, and where subtle themes are brought through the movie (which you can do with many viewings of the DVD). But, if you do, I don't think you will be disappointed. I think Weir does a masterful job of bringing together great action scenes & fine, tender themes.As for the cast:- Crowe was a flawless Captain Aubrey. He really makes the movie, and everything hangs on his performance. You believe in his integrity, his care & his grit.- Bettany was a very good match as the doctor. He showed both the strength of his personality (a good balance for Aubrey) and also his neurotic weaknesses.- Boyd (a plug for the LOTR actor) did quite admirably in a very different role for him. Rather than act as the ignorant mischief-maker (Pippen), he is the go-to sailor. He is there at crunch-time & is fully reliable. He seems to have enjoyed this role & filled it well.- The rest of the crew filled in their places admirably in order for you to be truly absorbed in this tale.And, finally, perhaps one of the most riveting aspects that they captured so well was the ship's delicate constitution - not the boat but the crew. They had to bear tight quarters, extreme weather, sickness, lack of food, battles & traumatic losses - all while staying strong & preparing for the next challenge. I thought this movie did a phenomenal job in showing how the sailors and officers lived & survived emotionally in such a world.

748222,A3OWUMRVHG0VGT,B00008W64E,The Lou,"[2, 2]","Master and Commander is bloody superb. This is a historically authentic picture (not to be mistaken for actual events and people but bits and pieces of real history sown together) takes us aboard Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) British war ship the ""HMS Surprise"". You can almost feel the sting of the frigid air and smell the salt water in this truly immersive exploit into the Napoleonic war between France and Britain. The Surprise and her crew are set in 1805 and have direct orders to hunt the French warship ""Acheron"" on the South American coast.  This is one of those rare epic movies with literally no flaws despite its grand nature. Peter Weir directs this saga of British life on the high seas and holds his cast to nothing short of impeccable acting. The battles scenes are gripping full of cannon ball explosions sending shards of wood into there victims along with fierce sword fighting. This movie is triumphant at demonstrating how difficult it was to be aboard a sea fairing ship whether an British officer or deck-hand. It conveyed well the highs and lows of moral and how punishment was swift and firm. Best of all Crowe demonstrates how a captains judgment is a tight rope leading to victory or defeat. Although only winning two Oscars this movie was nominated for ten including best picture and director only losing the other eight categories to Lord of the Rings the Return of the King (Hobbit Billy Boyd is among the cast of M&C;).Acting (Impeccable): Some of the cast members are quite young but even they deliver strong believable performances. Max Pirkis (who also gives a strong performance as the young Gaius Octavian in the hit HBO show Rome) character is young Midshipman William Blakeney which he plays with depth beyond his years. Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, who is also terrific) role demonstrates effectively how crude medical attention was but how without it many more souls would die. Bettany and Crowe relationship as captain and doctor plus friends adds many more layers to this already deep story. This leviathan of a movie has scene after a scene of deep heartfelt acting that never missed a beat or felt out of place.Score (Brilliant): The music is a variety of selected baroque and classical pieces some of which are played by the highly noted Yo-Yo Ma. This score hits the nail on the head throughout the whole sea faring adventure. The music does an eloquent job of setting the tone of each scene enhancing the overall mode whether hopeful or depressed. It's one of my all time favorite scores.Wardrobe/effects (Realistic): The outfits are varied and printed out to the exact detail from the British officers, able shipman, Royal Marines to the French navel outfits of the time. The ship looks spectacular whether in calm or rough seas. The cannon exchange from ship to ship is exhilarating due to the high quality effects maintained in this picture. Be warned there will be blood (no pun intended) in the battle scenes not a movie for younger viewers.Last take (solid purchase): This is a must see for all lovers of Patrick O'Brian books (this story was taken from several of his books), Horatio Hornblower, Russel Crowe, or lovers of an epic British driven Navel adventure. No female cast or campy love story thrown into this movie but there also wasn't any need for one when keeping to historical accuracy.

748223,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00008W64E,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[1, 2]","Russell Crowe is perfectly cast for this role. I can really believe in him as a commander who is one part fighter, one part man of learning. In one of my favorite recurring sequences in this movie, he and Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's doctor/naturalist/philosopher, perform classical duets on violin and cello, just for fun. (How they keep moisture and salt out of those instruments, which always seem to be sitting in the open, I cannot imagine.) Not only do these scenes set them both up as cultured men, but they dramatize that this relationship has been going on long before we join up with them. It's a brilliant way of getting a chunk of back-story out of the way in seconds.The protagonists' strong friendship, however, gets put to the test early on. There's no doubt Russell's character, like Russell himself, is a fair man with his fists, and when push comes to shove, like Russell himself, he prefers duels to duets. That's why he's put in charge of the HMS Surprise, a British warship sailing the seas during the Napoleonic Wars. (That's the early 1800s, for all you who have History For Dummies on your Amazon wish list.)  When the ship encounters a bigger, faster, meaner French vessel that wants to blow them out of the water, Russell goes on the offensive and chases the Frenchies around Cape Horn, through some of the nastiest storms this side of FEMA.Coincidentally, I rented this movie the same day as Steven Spielberg's Munich, and both films vaguely share a theme: fists or brains? Reason or violence? Neither film finds an answer (as if one could) but in both case characters take each side of the debate and argue passionately their beliefs, thoughts which are as old as the ancient Greeks at least. Yet despite some excellent moments in each film, and the high-minded intentions of each, somehow both come out feeling a little hollow somehow.Perhaps it is the attempt to rationalize what are, at bottom, irrational acts--terrorism in Munich and a style of warfare that was very much like terrorism, or at least guerilla warfare, in the early 19th century. It's gratifying to hear Crowe and Bettany debating fists vs. books downstairs in the captain's quarters. At the same time, I feel we've all been here before, and neither one has anything new to add.To be sure, all the prep work has been done. Early on we meet a young lad of about 12 who has been pressed into service. He loses an arm, yet he still wants to fight and is inspired by Crowe's meeting, when he was also about 12, with Lord Nelson, who also lacked one limb. There's something fascinating here about such a young man being forced to serve, losing an arm, and wanting to continue on, in the way this parallels Crowe's own early years in the service.  Yet as with the fight vs. think duality between Crowe and Bettany, the film never quite makes enough out of it. We are just presented these spectacles to observe, but they don't develop, or at least not much.Some parts of Master and Commander, however, are masterful. The storm sequences are stunning, the scenes where we watch the crew handle the ship make us feel like we are with them. The tricks and double-tricks of early naval warfare are fascinating to watch. Australian director Peter Weir is masterfully understated at times--there's a scene where an officer does a Dick Cheney on the ship's doctor, and the doctor has to operate on himself while someone else holds up a mirror so he can peer into his own wound. This could have been done with much gratuitous gore. Instead Weir gives us what we need to know and no more. And the Galapagos Island scenes are like a breath of fresh air: we feel as relieved as they to get off that cramped, damp ship. (Again, *how* did they keep the moisture out of those instruments?)While on the Galapagos Islands, making proto-Darwinian observations about creatures great and small, they stumble again upon the French warship, which sends Crowe in a tizzy because of his desire to get the better of a faster, bigger enemy. Somehow this had the feeling of inevitability to it, to the point that my wife, watching it with me, said as soon as they disembarked ""They're going to find that ship again."" It had a slightly mechanical quality to it. And although Kirk and Spock--I mean Crowe and Bettany--kick around the philosophical bean bag, neither really has a revelation or learns from the other. They end where they began. Quite literally.Compare this with another film with some similar themes which I think is one of the all-time neglected masterpieces, Never Cry Wolf (1983). The central character here is living at peace with nature--and two Inuits whom he thinks are the antithesis of modern civilized man with all his problems. Then one of those men shakes him up. While sitting on a rock cleaning his rifle, he tells our hero that he would have no qualms hunting and killing the wolves our hero adores because he has to buy rifle bullets and he needs a new snowmobile and wolf pelts go for several hundred dollars and he has to feed his family and...And we realize then and there that the whole set-up of the ""Noble Savage"" has been shattered by this one quiet scene. (For those of you not familiar with the concept, look it up in Wikipedia.) After that scene our hero--and we--are changed--in ways he only comes to grips with in the film's deeply moving, almost haiku-like coda.  In the present movie, there *is* a bit of a twist at the very end, and no, I couldn't foresee it, and neither will you.  But it didn't feel like enough. (It does leave the film open for a nice sequel, though. There are something like 20 novels in this series, so there are lots to choose from. It could become like Harry Potter.)To me the film could never convincingly settle on being either a cerebral drama about the dawning of the age of science or a tense cat-and-mouse thriller. (Parts of it reminded me of a cross between Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot and Steven Spielberg's Duel, believe it or not.) I'm aware that Weir likes to combine and blur American genres--his Witness (1985) is a great and effective example of this. But I don't feel this film was as seamlessly joined.The cast is uniformly excellent, however, and all the technicals are first-rate. Indeed very quickly we forget all about the Hollywood trickery and believe we are really at sea, traveling through storms and battles. Like a lot of films, this could have been a bit shorter, but the first half in particular has many edge-of-the-seat moments. In fact, we get so wrapped up in the events on board the Surprise that when the French ship finally appears up close, it almost feels strange to realize here is another craft with its own crew, its own captain--until now they've been abstractions. It's at this point I felt the film turned into another, different movie--a rather straightforward action film, with Russell Crowe slashing the enemy to bits with a feral quality reminiscent of...Russell Crowe. As I said, there's a twist at the end, but it wasn't enough and it left me feeling oddly unsettled, as if I'd just given the filmmakers two and a half hours of my time and got neither a resolution nor an open-ended question, just another chase.Still, for the spectacle alone this is worth a rental. I just don't agree with some people, such as my erstwhile colleague James Liu (""Dr. Jimbob"" in these pages) that this is a modern Kurosawa-esque film. Kurosawa would have left us more of a moral dilemma to chew on. He would have expressed it more fully, gone deeper. He wouldn't have raised interesting issues, only to step away from them to go fight another battle.",4,Russell's gonna need a bigger boat,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,7623,"['Russell', 'Crowe',

One example would have to be a bank of fog that his ship retreats into after being ambushed by a french ship during the time of war.The year is 1804, and France and England are at war as Napolean is conquering Europe one country after another. Only England's fleet of warships stands in Napoleans way of ruling the seas, so the tensions and battles at sea between different ships is at an all time high. Aubrey has been given the command to sink or capture a French ship named the Acheron, before it sinks any British ships.The whole story isn't just about playing a cat and mouse game between Aubrey and the French captain. Aubrey's crew start to wonder if the French ship is some type of phantom ship after numerous sneak attacks lead them to question if there is a curse on one of the sailors, like the famous story of Jonah. Aubrey must keep control of the ship but at the same time he still needs time to keep the men happy at the same time.There are also several other small stories in this movie, from the ship reaching the Galapagos islands and all the men looking at the strange creatures they never saw in their lives, to a storm at sea and a man being washed overboard, some great action scenes with just mother nature pounding on the ship. There's even a scene where the crew builds a floating device that reseambles a ship at nighttime to lure the french phantom ship away after yet another sneak attack.We don't see much of the French crew during the movie, and 95% of the story takes place on the British ship. However you do see the respect Aubrey has for the French captain, and he is determined to prove he is better of the two during their chasing games back and forth as both ships manage to get behind the other during several ambush attacks.The acting is superb, especially by Russel Crowe and the ship's doctor. The action scenes during the cannon fights and the climactic ending battle are well worth checking out. Emotional near the ending as men die for what they fought to protect, both on the French and British side.The extras have:Some behind the scenes shots of the movie and subtitles in English and Spanish. The ending of the story itself has a twist near the end, see if you can spot it before the characters in the story unveil the truth.

748230,ABKDVUJXBA1SZ,B00008W64E,Titus,"[2, 3]","Master and Commander is a terrific movie. Russell Crowe is perfectly cast as Cpt. Jack Aubrey, commander of the frigate H.M.S. Surprise during the Napoleonic Wars. His foil, Dr. Stephen Maturin, is played by the equally capable Paul Bettany. Both actors do a masterful job of portraying the deep, complex friendship that exists between the dyed-in-the-wool sailor Aubrey and the anarchist/Darwin wannabe Dr. Maturin. Bettany in particular does a wonderful job at exhibiting the naturalist Maturin's arrogance and intellectual snobbery that is the hallmark of so many of his 21st century descendents.The best moments of the film are when Aubrey, more in touch with what is beyond our senses, makes Maturin eat a little humble pie.In addition, the entire film just exudes ""the sea"". From the spectacularly staged battles to the depiction of life on board a 19th century sailing ship to the soundtrack I could practically smell the sea air coming out of my DVD player.It is a crying shame that this film did not do better at the box office. It is an even greater shame that it was not recognized in a more formal manner by the powers that be in the movie industry. I suppose its positive depiction of piety and Christian faith on the part of Aubrey and his crew did nothing to further its cause in a Hollywood overrun by secular humanist/atheists.I hope that Russell Crowe makes a career out of this franchise role the way Harrison Ford did with Indiana Jones.To sum up this is a film well worth your time and money.",5,Masterful and Commanding,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,1513,"['Master', 'Commander', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Cpt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'commander', 'frigate', 'H.M.S', 'Surprise', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'foil', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'played', 'equally', 'capable', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'actors', 'do', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'deep', 'complex', 'friendship', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'sailor', 'Aubrey', 'anarchist/Darwin', 'wannabe', 'Dr.', 'Maturin', 'Bettany', 'particular', 'wonderful', 'job', 'exhibiting', 'naturalist', 'Maturin', 'arrogance', 'intellectual', 'snobbery', 'hallmark', 'so', 'many', '21st', 'century', 'descendents.The', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Aubrey', 'more', 'touch', 'what', 'senses', 'Maturin', 'eat', 'little', 'humble', 'pie.In', 'addition', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'sea', 'spectacularly', 'staged', 'battles', 'depiction', 'life', 'board', '19th', 'century', 'sailing', 'ship', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'practically', 'smell', 'sea', 'air', 'coming', 'DVD', 'player.It', 'crying', 'shame', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'even', 'greater', 'shame', 'was', 'not', 'recognized', 'more', 'formal', 'manner', 'powers', 'be', 'movie', 'industry', 'suppose', 'positive', 'depiction', 'piety', 'Christian', 'faith', 'part', 'Aubrey', 'crew', 'did', 'nothing', 'further', 'cause', 'Hollywood', 'overrun', 'secular', 'humanist/atheists.I', 'hope', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'career', 'franchise', 'role', 'way', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'did', 'Indiana', 'Jones.To', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'money']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

While it does take liberties with its source material (something others have scored the movie very lowly for) and cannot be considered historically accurate, it does achieve an excellent representation of the period (circa War of 1812).The sets (comprised mostly of just the ships) are extremely authentic looking, as are the costumes. In addition, the script is excellent. The acting is top-notch, with Russell Crowe doing an outstanding job (much better than I thought he was capable of) and the entire supporting cast turning in admirable performances.

748234,A38QJ7JUUTVLKX,B00008W64E,"Tom Servo ""Robot""","[4, 4]","Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is like a sea journey, sailing on for 138 minutes without any particular destination in mind. You see plenty of lovely sights, and get a few snatches of swashbuckling and derring-do, but you get all that without benefit of plot or character development. This is a film that is literally all about the journey, not the destination. It is, though, a rather entertaining journey at times, and never a dull one. YES you read right, despite the length, this film is good. Not as good as Lord of the Rings mind you, but better than The Last Samaria. Plot is following Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, who must be a great actor because he's so likable in his movies even though he's a jerk in real life. The year is 1805, and Aubrey is piloting the HMS Surprise, out chasing down one of Napoleon's boats, which is said to be intent on spreading the Napoleonic Wars to South America. The Surprise is damaged in an early skirmish with the French vessel, but Aubrey does not turn back. He insists on repairing the ship at sea even as it continues its pursuit. This is folly, says the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin ), who is also Aubrey's best friend. Stephen suggests it's Aubrey's personal pride that's getting in the way of making a more rational decision, and that his crew's lives are at stake. Aubrey says no, that's not it, and the matter is dropped. Did you blink? Because if you did, you missed all you're going to get in the way of character arcs or personal struggles. Unlike most protagonists, Aubrey does not learn, grow or change over the course of the film. He's presented as a larger-than-life leader who doesn't make mistakes, and even his apparent mistakes turn out for the best. Sad thing is, I know people like that! The direction by Peter Weir (""The Truman Show,"" ""Dead Poets Society"") is praiseworthy indeed, as nearly the entire film takes place on the open sea, and the guy actually had a real ship built for that reason. It is far more exhilarating to see actual people on an actual boat on the actual ocean than it is to see them computer-generated, or to have scenes shot in water tanks on studio lots. Where trickery has been used, it's been integrated seamlessly with the real thing. As a viewer, it's a little thrilling to be part of a seafaring adventure, even if we're not really going anywhere. All in all I say that this is time at the cinema well spent and you should definately go and see it.",5,4.5stars,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,2479,"['Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'sea', 'journey', 'sailing', '138', 'minutes', 'particular', 'destination', 'mind', 'see', 'plenty', 'lovely', 'sights', 'get', 'few', 'snatches', 'swashbuckling', 'derring-do', 'get', 'benefit', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'literally', 'journey', 'not', 'destination', 'though', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'journey', 'times', 'never', 'dull', 'one', 'read', 'right', 'length', 'film', 'good', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'mind', 'better', 'Last', 'Samaria', 'Plot', 'following', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'actor', 'so', 'likable', 'movies', 'even', 'jerk', 'real', 'life', 'year', '1805', 'Aubrey', 'piloting', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'chasing', 'down', 'one', 'Napoleon', 'boats', 'said', 'be', 'intent', 'spreading', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'South', 'America', 'Surprise', 'damaged', 'early', 'skirmish', 'French', 'vessel', 'Aubrey', 'not', 'turn', 'back', 'repairing', 'ship', 'sea', 'even', 'pursuit', 'folly', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'who', 'also', 'Aubrey', 'best', 'friend', 'Stephen', 'Aubrey', 'personal', 'pride', 'getting', 'way', 'making', 'more', 'rational', 'decision', 'crew', 'lives', 'are', 'stake', 'Aubrey', 'not', 'matter', 'dropped', 'Did', 'blink', 'did', 'missed', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'way', 'character', 'arcs', 'personal', 'struggles', 'most', 'protagonists', 'Aubrey', 'not', 'learn', 'grow', 'change', 'course', 'film', 'presented', 'larger-than-life', 'leader', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistakes', 'even', 'apparent', 'mistakes', 'turn', 'out', 'best', 'Sad', 'thing', 'know', 'people', 'direction', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'praiseworthy', 'indeed', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'open', 'sea', 'guy', 'actually', 'had', 'real', 'ship', 'built', 'reason', 'far', 'more', 'exhilarating', 'see', 'actual', 'people', 'actual', 'boat', 'actual', 'ocean', 'see', 'computer-generated', 'have', 'scenes', 'shot', 'water', 'tanks', 'studio', 'lots', 'Where', 'trickery', 'been', 'used', 'been', 'integrated', 'seamlessly', 'real', 'thing', 'viewer', 'little', 'thrilling', 'be', 'part', 'seafaring', 'adventure', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'say', 'time', 'cinema', 'well', 'spent', 'should', 'definately', 'go', 'see']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World

I've written many reviews on here before and I've never been so excited to write on such an astounding film.Based on parts of the amazing Patrick O'Brian novel series, ""Master & Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" (combining the titles of the 1st and 10th book in the 20-book series) follows the story of Jack Aubrey, captain of the British ship Surprise and the adventure of its battle with the enemy Acheron ship of the French. This, of course, is an extremely simplified version, but explains the basic jist of this seafaring masterpiece. Fans of both the books and Crowe will certainly not be disappointed.With an absolutely brilliant performance by Russell Crowe (I definitely smell Oscar nomination despite Crowe not living up to the large size of Aubrey deliberately detailed in the books) and impeccable direction by Peter Weir, ""Master & Commander"" quite arguably becomes the best film ever made in this line of subject matter. Its engrossing, invigorating, captivating and above all: absolutely entertaining. Weir immediately jumps into the action from the get go in a scene that goes from a foggy figure in the distance to a full-blown epic battle. To top it all off, the visuals are inexplicably perfect, capturing the natural beauty of its locations with a tinge of perfect special effects.To pass this up would not only be foolish, but downright wrong.

748240,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008W64E,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 8]","See this opening credit.  Three big powers of Hollywood --  Miramax, Universal, and 20th Century Fox -- joined forces to produce ""Master and Commander,"" a thrilling adventure tale of HMS Surprise, led by Captain Jack Aubrey, set in 1805.  He is ordered to capture (or sink) the formidable emeny ship the Acheron, without any support from other ships.The story, based on Patric O'Brien books, is simple.  Russell Crowe's Captain is determined to chase the Acheron, whatever it takes, and in the following two hours you see the fierce battles, and very brief, quiet time of peace.  Paul Bettany is doctor of the ship, and Captain's most trusted friend, and their friendship also plays the major part of the film.But you want to know whether the battle scenes of the film deserve your time and money.  They do.  The authentic descriptions of the fighting on the sea in the 19th century, when good use of the wind and the cannonballs decided the winner, are presented with confidence and tact.  They are not bloody as the real ones perhaps, but the danger of being there is easily felt.My complaint is the film's occasional lull (including the literal one), in which the onward action so far, suddenly without warning, changes to a different theme.  When you think a chase between the two ships is about to start, the scene switches to a big storm.  When you think the ship is heading south, nearing the icy continent, you find the ship had already changed its course, going north.  This quick change, with episodic mode, comes probably from the way of adaptation of the original books, which are too long to be put into film.Russell Crowe (who put on weight for the role) is always good at playing this kind of character with machismo, and that's no surprise when he is so perfect, but more astonishing is Paul Bettany, who underwent the complete transformation from his past gangster No. 1 images to a thoroughly intelligent Dr. Maturin.  You recongnize in him no ""MC Chaucer"" he did ""Knight's Tale,"" and that is amazing.Peter Weir's direction is assured and well-paced, but to some the film's pace looks too slow at first.  He does not hurry to show the excitement of the battles or storm, and that shows his unshaken confidence in the material.  In fact, ""Master and Commander"" is a good case of ""the images tell everything,"" and to watch it is like seeing a majectic battleship gliding gracefully on the ocean.

The Acheron surprises the Surprise twice and Jack vows it won't happen again.

While it contains the excitement of many older and wonderful naval films such as Captain Blood or The Black Pirate, you won't find anyone swinging from ropes in this film as it is much more realistic as far as individual feats. The excitement and action are tempered with an attempt to portray the horror and butchery of 19th century naval warfare in a fairly realistic manner. When solid shot hits the ship, splinters rain death and destruction on everyone nearby. No one looks clean or pretty after any of the battle scenes.What sets this action film apart from most action pictures in recent years is it has a script! Action scenes are brief and exciting, but the real story comes from the character development and respectably written dialog. The friendship between the ship's surgeon and the captain as well as that between the surgeon and a very young officer are well developed and draw you into the story so that you do care what happens to these characters. You'll want to sing Rule Britannia when the crew goes into combat in the final battle scene of the film!The film balances the excitement and romance of The Age of Sail nicely with its more unpleasant features, like bug-ridden biscuits, water shortages and the terrors of combat and being lost at sea, all while creating memorable characters.

748247,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00008W64E,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""","[3, 4]","Bottom Line: In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more or this suburb movie about naval action in the 19th century.Master and Commander opens with the following caption: April 1805 Napoleon is master of Europe. Only the British Fleet stands before him. Oceans are now battlefields.Directed by Peter Weir with screenplay by Weir and John Collee, Master and Commander is based on two novels by Patrick O'Brian, part of a twenty-book series of Royal Navy Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey's adventures spanning the later 18th - early 19th centuries.This particular installment followed Captain Aubrey, superbly portrayed by Russell Crowe as he captains the 24 gun 6th Rate frigate HMS Surprise.  Aubrey's orders are to intercept French 4th Rate 44-gun Frigate Acheron currently en-route to the Pacific Ocean with the intention of making war in those waters off the coast of Brazil.  Aubrey is to either sink, burn, or take the French warship as a prize.In the first five minutes of the movie however the larger, faster, more heavily armed Acheron draws first blood, when materializing out of a fog bank she delivers a devastating broadside to the HMS Surprise, damaging the ships bowstrip, mainmast, and rudder, severely crippling the ship.  If it weren't for the same prevailing fog, the quick thinking of Aubrey and able rowers, the HMS Surprise would have surely been lost and well, the movie ended.Against all opposition Aubrey decides not to sail home for a refit of his shattered vessel, but to effect repairs at sea in a quite little inlet off the Brazilian coast.  Repairs completed the game of cat-and-mouse is taken up again as the HMS Surprise chases the Acheron around Cape Horn into the Great South Sea (Pacific), where she looses her mizzen topmast and a well liked seaman.The chase final ends at the Galapagos Islands (of all places) where British whalers are currently plying their trade, creating the perfect backdrop for the Acheron  to do her worst, and for the climatic battle scene to take place.My ThoughtsAs it unwinds, mostly onboard the HMS Surprise, the plot evolves into an extended game of cat-and-mouse: encounters with the aptly named Acheron as the ""phantom ship"" are in juxtaposition with prolonged glimpses into life onboard a 19th century Royal Navy Frigate.  We are treated to little interaction with the French crew, save through spyglass.  Most of the human interplay is reserved for Aubrey and his mixed crew of seasoned naval veterans, conscripts involuntarily impressed into service, young midshipmen, and powderboy's who are far too young to see battle.Weir's concentration on the HMS Surprise and her crew brings home a realism seldom seen in Hollywood productions; indeed the battle scenes between the HMS Surprise and the Acheron  seem cursory to the telling of the lives of men too harshly lived.  And Weir's passion for detail is evident in every frame as he brings to life O'Brian's rich historical details -- the sailors' routine, the pettiness and superstitions, the grim realities of 19th-century navies, the realistic battle scenes, the blood, and horror, and heroism, the honor and devotion to duty and country, are all portrayed in a stark often macabre reality.The cast is rich, varied, and too numerous to list in narrative, but the relationship between Aubrey and his old friend, and ships doctor, Stephen Maturin, portrayed by Paul Bettany is well worth exploring and receives the most attention throughout the movie.  Maturim is Aubrey's alter ego, his rational voice, and his musical partner.  It is through their music that we are treated to the two men's attempt to bring civility to an otherwise uncivilized pursuit.But Maturin is Aubrey's intellectual equal (Aubrey's military mind and almost mindless devotion to duty is offset by Maturin's humanity, conscience and scientific curiosity).  They are both endowed with a similar sense of honor, and know each other well enough--although we are not told from where their relationship sprang--to playfully, and oft-times earnestly challenge their respective positions, though Aubrey has to obvious upper hand; as captain the final word is his.  Their friendship was made warm and believable by their obvious onscreen chemistry; the closeness they shared while locked in a battle of wills made me wish for the same kind of uncompromising male friendship in my life.  Watching their verbal spars in the officer's mess and their infrequent musical duets together (Aubrey play the violin and Maturin plays the Cello) was for me clearly one of Master and Commander's greatest pleasures.Though through necessity there is ""nautical"" speech peppered throughout Master and Commander, it is only used to lend realism to the story, and contemporary speech is used otherwise. The use of contemporary chatter is designed to keep the less nautical engaged in the movie drawing them deeper into the action, allowing them to care, and enveloping the story in a cloak of humanity as the HMS Surprise pursues the Acheron  across two oceans.In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more; the movie ended just as the Aubrey and Maturin were once again engaged in play, and the ship was clearing the decks for action, once more in pursuit of the Acheron after Aubrey learns a prickly bit of information. This is testimony to the movies draw, it has everything one would expect from a high-seas adventure movie set in the 19th century--exhilarating battles, menacing weather conditions, honor, bravery, devotion to duty, treachery, superstition, God, and a wonderfully cast of characters that brings life onboard the HMS Surprise to a point where you can virtually taste and smell the salt laden sea spray on your lips and feel the fresh sea air on your skin.",5,I Didn't Want it to End!,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,5798,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'final', 'analysis', 'credit', 'rolled', 'felt',

Russell Crowe does a fine job as Captain 'Lucky Jack' Aubrey, a man with a history of experience and well respected by his sometimes grumbling men. The supporting cast is excellent with a list of characters that adds to the richness of life on a seafaring ship of that era.Crowe doesn't grandstand and take over the movie allowing the story, other characters and action to speak for themselves.

He is convincing as Captain Aubrey but instead of acting and emoting he does more posing than anything else. Maybe it's because the movie itself had absolutely no storyline to connect the viewers to the individual characters. The sea is beautiful, the Galapagos adventure amazing, the period pieces and ship detail as accurate as I could imagine, but there just is no plot. Two boats travel about a restless ocean trying to anniliate one another over political control, so what!

At its foundation, this is a very emotional film, essentially a series of love stories. Love of the ship, love of the ocean, fellowship of men, love of danger and adventure.At the center is the relationship between the men and the ship and sea.  The film does such an incredible job of bringing the ship to life on the ocean, of putting the men in the ship in such realistic ways that you are there with them, you feel the wood at your feet, the sea water on your face. You smell the blood and feel the bite of canon debris on your face and body.  You are aghast at the youth of some of the crew, the hardships.  The terrible choices that have to be made by the captain.  You are totally enaged by all the relationships that keep the ship afloat, that are the necessary foundation to the success of the Surprise.The detail is simply amazing.  Besides the technical aspects which are unsurpassed, I was amazed by the little touches, such as the scene where Aubrey is celebrating the turn back up north with a pudding cake.  He gives a portion to Lord Blakeney who is about 12 years of age.  And during the scene, as they are eating and rejoicing, his youth is betrayed by the chocolate markings of pudding on his mouth, such subtle detail. Another is when the captain is teaching the young 'uns about how to navigate.  You see them holding the instrument, both hands are required to hold the instrument, and you fear Weir may have forgotten that Blakeny now only has one hand, but sure enough, of the two hands holding Blakeney's instrument, you see that the other hand belong's to the Captain.  The continuity on this film is amazing.But the soul of the film is the relationship between the captain as played charismatically by Crowe and the doctor, embodied so compassionately by Bethany. And as if that weren't enough, the score is peerless with its combination of classical and original music.Really, every element comes together to form an almost flawless film.

The emotional depth is there and the acting just strengthens what is already strong.The synopsis is as follows: Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) is ordered by the British government, or whoever orders around the navy, to search for a certain French ship and take them over.  What is interesting about this plot is the ship's (HMS Surprise) small size compared to the French ship's grandeur.  You always think the Surprise could never stand up against such a ship, but there are so many twists and turns externally and internally that keep you locked on the story and continuously captivated.Peter Wier directs the film, and does a wondeful job, Oscar-worthy.  Most of the movie takes place within the Surprise, and Wier masterfully creates an intimate environment out of a small shell one would think too compact to bear so much life.  I really think this is one of the best directing jobs of the year.  Watch how he creates such a wonderful place, such a complex place, out of the ""Surprise.""The best acting credit goes to Paul Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, the crazy roommate) for conveying such a quiet person's inner bieng and depth so beautifully.  His character always makes you smile, and always seems so fearless when it comes to standing up to his Captain.  His naturalist buddy, a small boy whose arm is amputated, and he share this relationship that Bettany elevated to a level where most anyone can go to.  It's that level of relaitionship where you'd do anything to keep the person alive, no matter what age they are, because they make you feel so complete.  The little boy is like Bettany's best friend, and also does a wonderful job for a young actor.I have only one disclaimer, and that is to not expect there to be a naval battle at every corner, because there are long stretches of conversations and injuries that are exciting in itself, but not what one might expect.

748252,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00008W64E,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 3]","An amazing film, Peter Weir's Master and Commander manages to capture all the hazards of the high seas. Russell Crowe plays &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey commander of the HMS Surprise. His mission is to pursue the French ship Acheron and destroy her preventing the French from further attacks on British ships. I've never read any of Patrick O'Brian's novels but this strong adaption by Weir written with John Colle switches the time frame of the British/American conflict of 1812 to the war between Britian and Napoleon's France in 1805.Weir manages to breath life into O'Brian's creations with very authentic ships and settings. He captures all the brutality and grim, violent moments that sailors faced at sea. In many respects, the ship was more than home and more than country for these sailors; she was sanctuary and tomb for these sailors. The HMS Surprise was the only thing providing refuge from the harsh elements of the high seas. In battle, the ship if not well commanded could also become a death trap. If caught in a losing battle, these sailors were at the mercy of the ocean and the ocean was a brutal and deadly mistress.Crowe and co-star Paul Bettany (Crowe's co-star from A Dangerous Mind)give outstanding performances. Their onscreen chemistry and conflicts generate enough dramatic sparks to keep the film heated during the sequences between battle. Bettany plays ship's surgeon and friend/confidant to Aubrey. He also acts as Aubrey's conscience providing him with a link to the civilized world he left behind. Although Aubrey doesn't always take his advice it provides perspective and an honest sense of how far he can push his crew.The CGI ships and visual effects are very impressive. It's difficult to distinguish the sets from the CGI effects. The battle sequences are impressive. As a member of the audience you feel as if you've been dropped into a battle from two hundred years ago. As someone who hasn't read the books and has no sailing experience (or Naval experience), I still found the film fascinating, powerful and involving. Crowe's commanding presence also gives added power to this fine film. Although it isn't Weir's best film (and Weir has directed a number of outstanding films including The Truman Show, Picnic At Hanging Rock, The Last Wave, Witness, Fearless and The Year of Living Dangerously among many), it has moments as powerful and involving as his best. Although the film sags a bit in the middle as Aubrey searches for the French vessel the Acheon, the power of the material and performances keeps the audience interested and involved.",4,Crowe and Weir command your attention,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,2589,"['amazing', 'film', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Master', 'Commander', 'capture', 'hazards', 'high', 'seas', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'quot', 'Lucky', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'commander', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'mission', 'pursue', 'French', 'ship', 'Acheron', 'destroy', 'preventing', 'French', 'further', 'attacks', 'British', 'ships', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'novels', 'strong', 'adaption', 'Weir', 'written', 'John', 'Colle', 'time', 'frame', 'British/American', 'conflict', '1812', 'war', 'Britian', 'Napoleon', 'France', '1805.Weir', 'manages', 'breath', 'life', ""O'Brian"", 'creations', 'very', 'authentic', 'ships', 'settings', 'brutality', 'grim', 'violent', 'moments', 'sailors', 'faced', 'sea', 'many', 'respects', 'ship', 'was', 'more', 'home', 'more', 'country', 'sailors', 'was', 'sanctuary', 'tomb', 'sailors', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'providing', 'refuge', 'harsh', 'elements', 'high', 'seas', 'battle', 'ship', 'not', 'well', 'commanded', 'could', 'also', 'become', 'death', 'trap', 'caught', 'losing', 'battle', 'sailors', 'were', 'mercy', 'ocean', 'ocean', 'was', 'brutal', 'deadly', 'mistress.Crowe', 'co-star', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Crowe', 'co-star', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'conflicts', 'generate', 'enough', 'dramatic', 'sparks', 'keep', 'film', 'heated', 'sequences', 'battle', 'Bettany', 'ship', 'surgeon', 'friend/confidant', 'Aubrey', 'also', 'Aubrey', 'conscience', 'providing', 'link', 'civilized', 'world', 'left', 'behind', 'Aubrey', ""n't"", 'always', 'take', 'advice', 'perspective', 'honest', 'sense', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'push', 'crew.The', 'CGI', 'ships', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'sets', 'CGI', 'effects', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'impressive', 'member', 'audience', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dropped', 'battle', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'sailing', 'experience', 'Naval', 'experience', 'still', 'found', 'film', 'fascinating', 'powerful', 'involving', 'Crowe', 'commanding', 'presence', 'also', 'added', 'power', 'fine', 'film', ""n't"", 'Weir', 'best', 'film', 'Weir', 'directed', 'number', 'outstanding', 'films', 'including', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'Last', 'Wave', 'Witness', 'Fearless', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'many', 'moments', 'powerful', 'involving', 'best', 'film', 'bit', 'middle', 'Aubrey', 'searches', 'French', 'vessel', 'Acheon', 'power', 'material', 'performances', 'keeps', 'audience', 'interested', 'involved']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
748253,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00008W64E,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[5, 5]","This is a fantastic movie about the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey, stalking the French vessell Acheron to the ""far side of the world"" during the Napoleanic era.  The filem is intricately detailed, and while I am no sailor, most of the details strike true.  I do know that the British Navy by the time of this story absolutely revered Lord Nelson, and that reverance is played out in this movie when several younger offciers ask the Captain for impressions of Nelson during one of his two meeting with the Admiral.  The cannons have names, the bells number the hours of the shipboard day.  A knotted rope line is played out to measure the ship's speed in knots.  A sounding is taken to read the depth of the sea, and sextant lessons are given to measure true noon.  In fact the level of detail is overwhelming, but the story is just as good.The Acheron is the superior ship, and at first it seems the Captain is also superior.  He surprises the Surprise twice, once coming out of the fog at the beginning of the movie and once by hiding in an inlet and letting the Surprise chase on by.Captain Aubry only barely manages to escape into the fog the first time, and into the night the second.But in the end, Captain Aubrey wins out, but not before the ship and crew has made many sacrifices.Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubry is spectacular.  I was also immensley impressed with Max Pirkis's portrayal of young Mr. Blakeny.  The photography and camera work were absolutely first rate, as well as the tremendous attention to detail.This is a really great movie on so many levels.

748254,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00008W64E,Westley,"[3, 3]","""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" depicts the adventures of the HMS Surprise, a British frigate trolling the Atlantic during the Napoleonic Wars.  The ship's captain, ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is ordered to track down and engage the French frigate, Acheron.  One foggy night, the Surprise happens upon the Acheron, with full out battle following.  The Surprise is forced to retreat, and a genuinely exciting game of cat and mouse between the two ships ensues for the rest of the film.Clunky title notwithstanding, ""Master and Commander"" is a truly superb action film.  I have never been a fan of movies about 19th century seafaring.  The battle scenes are too often both static and confusing.  However, Peter Weir is more than up to the task here; he's always been an outstanding director, but this film is among his best work.  The chase scenes and ensuing battles are suspenseful and fully engaging.  Weir also manages to infuse a great deal of humanity - each time a member of the Surprise is killed or even injured, it's heart-breaking.  Fortunately, he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for directing, his fourth.The Oscar nominated script is beautiful but never cloying, with wonderful acting contributing to its success.  Crowe and Bettany (as Dr. Stephen Maturin) brilliantly portray the complex relationship between their characters - close friends who respect but also challenge each other.  The film is, of course, based on two novels from the esteemed series by Patrick O'Brian.  I have not read any of the Aubrey-Maturin books, so I cannot attest to how accurate the film is.  However, clearly a viewer need not have read the books to enjoy the film.  Incidentally, I immediately purchased the first book in the series and hope to tackle it soon.  Finally, every technical aspect of ""Master and Commander"" is exceptional - the score, cinematography, costumes, and so forth.  All these elements add up to a lush modern classic.",5,"""Run like smoke and oakum!""",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1971,"['Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'adventures', 'HMS', 'Surprise', 'British', 'frigate', 'trolling', 'Atlantic', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'ship', 'captain', 'Lucky', 'Jack', 'Aubrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'ordered', 'track', 'down', 'engage', 'French', 'frigate', 'Acheron', 'One', 'foggy', 'night', 'Surprise', 'Acheron', 'full', 'out', 'battle', 'following', 'Surprise', 'forced', 'retreat', 'genuinely', 'exciting', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'two', 'ships', 'ensues', 'rest', 'film.Clunky', 'title', 'notwithstanding', 'Master', 'Commander', 'truly', 'superb', 'action', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'movies', '19th', 'century', 'seafaring', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'static', 'confusing', 'However', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'here', 'always', 'been', 'outstanding', 'director', 'film', 'best', 'work', 'chase', 'scenes', 'ensuing', 'battles', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'fully', 'engaging', 'Weir', 'also', 'infuse', 'great', 'deal', 'humanity', 'time', 'member', 'Surprise', 'killed', 'even', 'injured', 'heart-breaking', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'rewarded', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'directing', 'fourth.The', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'script', 'beautiful', 'never', 'cloying', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'contributing', 'success', 'Crowe', 'Bettany', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Maturin', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'relationship', 'characters', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'respect', 'also', 'challenge', 'other', 'film', 'course', 'based', 'two', 'novels', 'esteemed', 'series', 'Patrick', ""O'Brian"", 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Aubrey-Maturin', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'how', 'accurate', 'film', 'However', 'clearly', 'viewer', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Incidentally', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'hope', 'tackle', 'soon', 'Finally', 'technical', 'aspect', 'Master', 'Commander', 'exceptional', 'score', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'so', 'forth', 'elements', 'add', 'up', 'lush', 'modern', 'classic']",Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
