Alcorn,"[8, 8]","It has been a very long time since my name went on the ""notify me when this product is available"" list for the balance of Diagnosis Murder, one of my all-time favorite television series.  I bought the first three seasons as soon as they became available, but was forced to anxiously await the others.  Each season contains some of the most memorable episodes and having a complete collection to view as often and whenever I wish is my goal.  It was a frustrating wait for seasons four and five, and I only hope that the remaining seasons are released more promptly.  This is a fantastic cast who feel like family to those of us who watched them on TV each week and I now say, ""Welcome home!""",5,Worth the Long Wait,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,691,"['been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'name', 'went', 'notify', 'when', 'product', 'available', 'list', 'balance', 'Diagnosis', 'Murder', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'bought', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'as', 'soon', 'became', 'available', 'was', 'forced', 'anxiously', 'await', 'others', 'season', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'having', 'complete', 'collection', 'view', 'often', 'whenever', 'wish', 'goal', 'was', 'frustrating', 'wait', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'only', 'hope', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'are', 'released', 'more', 'promptly', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'who', 'feel', 'family', 'who', 'watched', 'TV', 'week', 'now', 'say', 'Welcome', 'home']",Diagnosis Murder: Season 4 Part Two
