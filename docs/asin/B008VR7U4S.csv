1577023,AKGUA506COKQG,B008VR7U4S,Alison Jones,"[3, 4]","Since the movie, Nipples and Palm Trees, currently only has a handful of reviews, I thought I'd take the time to weigh in and put up a review of my own.  I'm not a big movie buff, although I do watch quite a few on Amazon each week, and I think I know good entertainment when I see it.The filming style is rather gritty, not as slick looking as big-budget movies usually are.  There isn't a lot of music, but what little there is is selected well, and placed well throughout the movie.  I like the theme, I LOVE the characters.  I thought the supporting cast was more brilliant in spots than the leads.  Overall, I think this is a refreshing twist on the tired, old rom-com genre.  As some other reviewers have noted, there are some darn good one-liners in this movie that had me rolling in laughter.Worth the watch, to be sure.  Its not your everyday flick in any sense and I wish the writer/actor great success now and in the future.  I, personally, would love to see more movies like this one.",4,"Its funny, its sweet, I'll likely watch again in near future",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,996,"['movie', 'Nipples', 'Palm', 'Trees', 'currently', 'only', 'handful', 'reviews', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'time', 'weigh', 'put', 'up', 'review', 'own', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'movie', 'buff', 'do', 'watch', 'quite', 'few', 'Amazon', 'week', 'think', 'know', 'good', 'entertainment', 'when', 'see', 'it.The', 'filming', 'style', 'rather', 'gritty', 'not', 'slick', 'looking', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'music', 'what', 'little', 'selected', 'well', 'placed', 'well', 'movie', 'theme', 'LOVE', 'characters', 'thought', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'more', 'brilliant', 'spots', 'leads', 'Overall', 'think', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'tired', 'old', 'rom-com', 'genre', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'are', 'darn', 'good', 'one-liners', 'movie', 'had', 'rolling', 'laughter.Worth', 'watch', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'everyday', 'flick', 'sense', 'wish', 'writer/actor', 'great', 'success', 'now', 'future', 'personally', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'one']",Nipples & Palm Trees
