180178,A3GGSAENATIAW1,155890834X,Ace,"[1, 1]","Nothing To Lose is one of those rare films that has truly universal appeal. Tim Robbins is utterly convincing in this comedy turn, the perfect foil to Martin Lawrence's trademark exacerbation! It's a surprisingly lighthearted comedy, despite the physical violence and adult language! The screenplay invokes very familiar social conflicts (poor vs. rich; black vs. white, et. Al) which subjects us to typical class warfare, but with a very honest spin to it. Even though we've seen this set up before, the execution was masterful. Giancarlo Esposito and John C. McGinley play thugs that were existential in their approach, which is very rare for a comedy. In my humble opinion, I am surprised that this movie wasn't more popular; it's more well known for the hit single ""Ladie's Night"" from the soundtrack. Today's comedies tend to rely on us dropping our intellect and our moral standards (see ANY teen or stoner film, or the Hangover series and the like), and Nothing To Lose now seems, in retrospect, a product from an endangered era.",5,A comedy for all generations!,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1036,"['Nothing', 'Lose', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'truly', 'universal', 'appeal', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'comedy', 'turn', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'trademark', 'exacerbation', 'surprisingly', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'physical', 'violence', 'adult', 'language', 'screenplay', 'very', 'familiar', 'social', 'conflicts', 'poor', 'vs.', 'rich', 'black', 'vs.', 'white', 'et', 'Al', 'typical', 'class', 'warfare', 'very', 'honest', 'spin', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'set', 'up', 'execution', 'was', 'masterful', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'play', 'thugs', 'were', 'existential', 'approach', 'very', 'rare', 'comedy', 'humble', 'opinion', 'am', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'popular', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'hit', 'single', 'Ladie', 'Night', 'soundtrack', 'Today', 'comedies', 'tend', 'rely', 'dropping', 'intellect', 'moral', 'standards', 'see', 'ANY', 'teen', 'stoner', 'film', 'Hangover', 'series', 'like', 'Nothing', 'Lose', 'now', 'retrospect', 'product', 'endangered', 'era']",N/A

They committ a couple of robberies in Arizona and are mistaken for another white and black man (John C.  McGinley and Giancarlo Esposito). Nick Beam (Robbins) hated Terrance P.  Davidson (Lawrence) at first but he met the Davidson family and change his  perspective completly.

180240,ABLBRUT8DALNN,155890834X,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Before Hollywood got it's hands on him, Martin Lawrence was an outrageous and hilarious stand-up comedian. In recent years, he was been toned down, in an effort to turn him into another Will Smith, but back in the day, there were few who were as funny or extreme as Martin Lawrence. Nothing To Lose is a great example of just how good, Lawrence was during his prime. The story follows Nick Beam, (Tim Robbins) a man who has seen something that no man should ever see. Devastated and downtrodden, Beam drops everything and goes for a drive, when a street thug named T, (Martin Lawrence) puts a gun in his face and tries to take his car. Beam's responds by laughing and saying, ""Boy did you pick the wrong guy on the wrong day,"" and then he floors it, taking us into an improbably, but terrific adventure. Ever since his portrayal of Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption, Tim Robbins has been tight-cased into these high profile dramatic roles, making it hard to remember that he actually got his start doing comedy. The lanky, loveable, anger-crazed man he plays in this film is absolutely hysterical. The chemistry between Robbins and Lawrence is what makes this film work. They both have a distinct form of comedy that you wouldn't expect to work as well as it does, but I can say without hesitation that this under the radar comedy is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,1401,"['Hollywood', 'got', 'hands', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'outrageous', 'hilarious', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'recent', 'years', 'was', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'effort', 'turn', 'Will', 'Smith', 'back', 'day', 'were', 'few', 'who', 'were', 'funny', 'extreme', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Nothing', 'Lose', 'great', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'prime', 'story', 'Nick', 'Beam', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'something', 'man', 'should', 'ever', 'see', 'Devastated', 'downtrodden', 'Beam', 'everything', 'drive', 'when', 'street', 'thug', 'named', 'T', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'gun', 'face', 'take', 'car', 'Beam', 'responds', 'laughing', 'saying', 'Boy', 'did', 'pick', 'wrong', 'guy', 'wrong', 'day', 'then', 'taking', 'improbably', 'terrific', 'adventure', 'Ever', 'portrayal', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'been', 'tight-cased', 'high', 'profile', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'making', 'hard', 'remember', 'actually', 'got', 'start', 'doing', 'comedy', 'lanky', 'loveable', 'anger-crazed', 'man', 'film', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'chemistry', 'Robbins', 'Lawrence', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'have', 'distinct', 'form', 'comedy', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'hesitation', 'radar', 'comedy', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time']",N/A
