1008647,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000H0MKO2,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 5]","Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is perhaps the most detested man in America.  As a smoking lobbyist, he must put a good face on the hated and waning tobacco market.  He is savvy and smart, making appearances on news interviews and daytime talk shows.  He creates spin in the cleverest ways.  (For instance, he must address a panel on ""The Joan Lunden Show"" and face an-ex smoker, a child who is dying from cancer.  He says that they don't want people to die of cancer because they would lose their customers, and he only recommends cigarettes when they are grown up.)  He must lobby ""to pay the mortgage,"" but he also must keep his son's respect.  Eventually, like many others, his son is caught up in the spin of his father's saviness.  He learns to become as persuasive as his father. Yet, for Nick, persuasion is still a challenge: He must stand up to a back-stabbing boss and his two partners in crime, one (Maria Bello) the alcohol advocate, and one for firearms.  Although his biggest nemesis is the senator of Vermont (William Macy), a pompous politician whose attempts to squash Naylor seem futile.  His second biggest contender is a beautiful reporter who exposes him when he is oddly vulnerable.Based on a Christopher Buckley novel, ""Thank You for Smoking"" is a satire that hits the right delivery.  It is not subtle, but it doesn't really become self-righteous.  The movie is funny, yet obvious, without beating the viewer over the head.  Sometimes the tension of the plot wains, but it is seldom unengaging.  The performances are good--especially Aaron Eckhart as the smooth, conniving Naylor.  It should be said that the previews are excellent, but they do give away too many of the punchlines.  (For those who are uninitiated, plug your ears if they start to show this film before you see it.)  For others who are sensitive, there is a great deal of profanity and a sex scene (which does make a point, by the way) that may deter some away.  Overall, it is a solid comedy with fine portrayals and enough punches to go around (politics, entertainment, and the tobacco industry).",4,High-tar (and Feather) Humor,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,2086,"['Nick', 'Naylor', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'perhaps', 'most', 'detested', 'man', 'America', 'smoking', 'lobbyist', 'must', 'put', 'good', 'face', 'hated', 'waning', 'tobacco', 'market', 'savvy', 'smart', 'making', 'appearances', 'news', 'interviews', 'daytime', 'talk', 'spin', 'cleverest', 'ways', 'instance', 'must', 'address', 'panel', 'Joan', 'Lunden', 'Show', 'face', 'an-ex', 'smoker', 'child', 'who', 'dying', 'cancer', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'die', 'cancer', 'would', 'lose', 'customers', 'only', 'cigarettes', 'when', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'must', 'lobby', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'also', 'must', 'keep', 'son', 'respect', 'Eventually', 'many', 'others', 'son', 'caught', 'up', 'spin', 'father', 'saviness', 'become', 'as', 'persuasive', 'father', 'Nick', 'persuasion', 'still', 'challenge', 'must', 'stand', 'up', 'back-stabbing', 'boss', 'two', 'partners', 'crime', 'one', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'alcohol', 'advocate', 'one', 'firearms', 'biggest', 'nemesis', 'senator', 'Vermont', 'William', 'Macy', 'pompous', 'politician', 'attempts', 'squash', 'Naylor', 'seem', 'futile', 'second', 'biggest', 'contender', 'beautiful', 'reporter', 'who', 'when', 'oddly', 'vulnerable.Based', 'Christopher', 'Buckley', 'novel', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'satire', 'right', 'delivery', 'not', 'subtle', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'self-righteous', 'movie', 'funny', 'yet', 'obvious', 'beating', 'viewer', 'head', 'tension', 'plot', 'wains', 'seldom', 'unengaging', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'smooth', 'conniving', 'Naylor', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'previews', 'are', 'excellent', 'do', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'punchlines', 'who', 'are', 'uninitiated', 'plug', 'ears', 'start', 'show', 'film', 'see', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'sensitive', 'great', 'deal', 'profanity', 'sex', 'scene', 'make', 'point', 'way', 'may', 'deter', 'away', 'Overall', 'solid', 'comedy', 'fine', 'portrayals', 'enough', 'punches', 'go', 'around', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'tobacco', 'industry']",N/A

How could it be?Nick Naylor is one of the most interesting protagonists to come along in quite a while, and the topic is a very blunt ""smoke smoke smoke!"" message.  The movie is based on a novel which I haven't read but which must surely also be about him.  He's an interesting guy.What I see here is a brilliant balancing act.  The humor manages to go over the top without ever sacrificing character, credibility, or even plot.  I honestly didn't expect a plot, but rather a one-joke film.  So it was a pleasant surprise there.I will say that you have to be in the right mood, though.  The first time I fired up the DVD, I stopped after about 30 minutes and put it aside for later.

1008649,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000H0MKO2,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Thank You for Smoking, 2006 filmThe film opens on a TV show with Joan Lunden. A 15-year old was diagnosed with cancer. Neil Naylor, a lobbyist for a tobacco company, is one of the guests. Twelve hundred people die each day from smoking tobacco. Is there a link between nicotine and cancer? [No, it's the tars and residue from the smoke.] Naylor is a ""spin doctor"", an advocate for his cause. Watch him work! The ""St. Euthanasius"" school? Lobbyists talk for living. People who tell you what to do and what to think (like newspaper columnists). ""Challenging authority""? Does an ""endless appeals system"" make our government the greatest? Can it be proved? ""If you argue correctly you are never wrong."" [Can that be proven?] ""That was unnecessary."" Do movies sell cigarettes? [Yes.]Senator Ortolan Finisterre is from Vermont, he is against smoking. Big Tobacco hopes to put cigarettes in all the movies, like in the past. The conversation is comically cynical. ""What motivates you?"" ""Population control."" ""California is not a safe place."" Jeff McGall is a power in Hollywood. He has ideas for cigarettes. [Are multinational corporations like child murderers?] Naylor has to deliver a suitcase full of money to a man in Southern California. ""Let's talk."" The talk is funny. ""How did you know he'd take the money?"" One man calls in a threat to Naylor. What will he do? Terrorists kidnap Naylor in broad daylight from a street in Washington! Where is Homeland Security? He wakes up in a hospital. ""Cigarettes saved your life."" But he must quit cigarettes. ""Nicotine patches are deadly."" Public sympathy is on Naylor's side now. Reporter Heather Holloway has a story on Naylor: he is doing it for the money. Bad publicity! Naylor is fired because of this scandal. He is going downhill. Joey cheers him up.Naylor has new ideas. He has a press conference to say he will testify at the Senate Hearing. Naylor proclaims the dangers of cholesterol from the cheese of Vermont! His advocacy of ""personal choice"" and individual freedom trumps the idea of a skull and crossbones on each pack of cigarettes. He will be rehired as a lobbyist now. Or will he? The last scenes show what happened to the other people. ""There is no direct evidence that links cell phone usage to brain cancer."" [But they carry this warning label in Europe!]I suspect the book was better than this film. It is funny in spots as a satiric comment on advertising in society. But the humor requires a point of view to agree with the story. This film is clever in presenting situations that are ambiguous so it plays to both points of view. Big Tobacco and its lobbyists are the heroes, a Senator from Vermont is the villain.

1008650,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000H0MKO2,Adam Craig,"[2, 3]","Normally, I am not a very big fan of satire.  In general, I think that satires are too smart for their own good.  By saying that, I mean that most satires tend to identify their target in too serious of a manner that greatly affects the film's ability to make you laugh.  Thank You For Smoking definitely does not fit into that category, I am happy to say.The film's main character, Nick Naylor, is a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, which is based in Washington and is funded by conglomerate tobacco to get statistics that are favorable to cigarettes, their dangers, and their addictiveness.  Naylor is immediately identified as the ""bad guy,"" as we first see him on The Joan Show, where he has to defend himself against an army of experts and ""cancer boy.""  Naylor shows off his ability to defend himself, and cigarettes, to a bitterly hostile group of people ready to devour his soul.  When a senator from Vermont launches a campaign to put a ""poison"" label on cigarette packs (complete with a skull and crossbones), Naylor is summoned by his company and ""the Captain"" to go out to Hollywood to persuade a major Hollywood talent agent to get his stars to start smoking in films again, to make it cool.  While that is the basic storyline of the movie, the film also goes out of its way to create a really cool relationship between Naylor and his son.  Apparently, this wasn't in the book and is totally a creation of Reitman's script, and it is what really makes the movie complete and somewhat meaningful.  Naylor's grooming of his son to become as talented a talker as he is is really entertaining, and is what really holds the film together.Not only is the story good, but the jokes are also very funny.  Unlike most other satires, Thank You For Smoking directly identifies its target very clearly, but it remains entertaining and light-hearted by basically playing both sides of the fence.  Both sides of the political spectrum will be reddened by some of the things that are depicted in this film.  And, it seems, the film applies smoking (a very controversial issue these days) to many other situations that have a very similar concept that are also very prevalent in our society.I have to also mention the amazing all-star cast that is in the film.  Whenever your film's cast list includes the names of talent such as Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, William H. Macy, Maria Bello, and Rob Lowe, you know that acting is pretty much an ace-in-the-hole.  Surprisingly enough, the best performance in the movie, in my opinion, was by far David Koechner.  Koechner plays the representative for the gun companies in the weekly meetings of the MOD (merchants of death ) squad.  Whenever Koechner was entered into a scene, I almost started laughing immediately, and I hope his performance in this film makes his name a little more widely known around Hollywood, because he has great talent (as also shown in Anchorman).This movie is a definite recommendation for anyone that enjoys not only satires, but what most would refer to as ""intelligent comedy.""  It is really great to be able to go see a film and laugh your butt off while also feeling like your IQ level didn't just drop 50 points.",4,(4.5) A bitterly funny satire,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,3198,"['Normally', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'satire', 'general', 'think', 'satires', 'are', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'saying', 'mean', 'most', 'satires', 'tend', 'identify', 'target', 'too', 'serious', 'manner', 'greatly', 'film', 'ability', 'make', 'laugh', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'definitely', 'not', 'fit', 'category', 'am', 'happy', 'say.The', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'lobbyist', 'Academy', 'Tobacco', 'Studies', 'based', 'Washington', 'funded', 'conglomerate', 'tobacco', 'get', 'statistics', 'are', 'favorable', 'cigarettes', 'dangers', 'addictiveness', 'Naylor', 'immediately', 'identified', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'see', 'Joan', 'Show', 'where', 'defend', 'army', 'experts', 'cancer', 'boy', 'Naylor', 'ability', 'defend', 'cigarettes', 'bitterly', 'hostile', 'group', 'people', 'ready', 'devour', 'soul', 'When', 'senator', 'Vermont', 'campaign', 'put', 'poison', 'label', 'cigarette', 'packs', 'complete', 'skull', 'crossbones', 'Naylor', 'summoned', 'company', 'Captain', 'go', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'persuade', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'agent', 'get', 'stars', 'start', 'smoking', 'films', 'again', 'make', 'cool', 'basic', 'storyline', 'movie', 'film', 'also', 'way', 'create', 'really', 'cool', 'relationship', 'Naylor', 'son', 'Apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'totally', 'creation', 'Reitman', 'script', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'complete', 'somewhat', 'meaningful', 'Naylor', 'grooming', 'son', 'become', 'talented', 'talker', 'really', 'entertaining', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'together.Not', 'only', 'story', 'good', 'jokes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'most', 'other', 'satires', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'directly', 'target', 'very', 'clearly', 'entertaining', 'light-hearted', 'basically', 'playing', 'sides', 'fence', 'sides', 'political', 'spectrum', 'will', 'be', 'reddened', 'things', 'are', 'depicted', 'film', 'film', 'applies', 'smoking', 'very', 'controversial', 'issue', 'days', 'many', 'other', 'situations', 'have', 'very', 'similar', 'concept', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'prevalent', 'society.I', 'have', 'also', 'mention', 'amazing', 'all-star', 'cast', 'film', 'Whenever', 'film', 'cast', 'list', 'names', 'talent', 'such', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'know', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'ace-in-the-hole', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'far', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Koechner', 'representative', 'gun', 'companies', 'weekly', 'meetings', 'MOD', 'merchants', 'death', 'squad', 'Whenever', 'Koechner', 'was', 'entered', 'scene', 'almost', 'started', 'laughing', 'immediately', 'hope', 'performance', 'film', 'name', 'little', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'talent', 'also', 'shown', 'Anchorman', '.This', 'movie', 'definite', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'refer', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'really', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'butt', 'off', 'also', 'feeling', 'IQ', 'level', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'drop', '50', 'points']",N/A

This movie ends before it starts, its one of those where you want to rewind it in the middle of watching just to make sure that you didn't miss any thing.  Yes, it's just that blunt.  If Aaron Eckard who plays big tobacco lobbyist does not condition you to think differently about smoking or some thing other conversational topic then maybe you need to watch this movie again.  The body of the message of this film portrays is not that you should pick up smoking, that is it right and that you should go out and buy your child a pack on their 18th birthday.  But rather this movie's real message is about challenging the viewer to think for himself or herself.  Amen!  A film that makes people to think for themselves in the world of movies where you walkout dumber than you go in and then you wonder, why did I just pay for that?Naylor's job is to get himself caught in the middle of the controversy of smoking in America.  His message is that people should think for themselves and that big tobacco needs customers, so it to their benefit of people who have cancer to continue to smoke and if they die it would be a loss for the smoking industry.  Naylor's personal and professional life are one in the same, as he is convinced himself that when you on the right side of the argument you can never be wrong.  And even if you have to change your argument half way through it you can always be right, even when right is all negotiable.For all the films produced today that believe their causes are to inform and pump information into your head, fact or fiction, Thank You For Not Smoking ask you the question of whether or not thinking that way is correct, and if so, why?

1008653,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000H0MKO2,Alistair McHarg,"[5, 6]","Here's a good example of how smart, literary satire doesn't translate well onto the screen.  Thank You For Smoking does have some big laughs, but it just doesn't hang together as a movie.  The titles are extremely good - and it does contain one high concept joke - no one is actually ever seen smoking a cigarette throughout the entire picture.  But film is a ""show me don't tell me"" medium, and Nick's tiresome monologues, required to set up point of view and plot turns, show the fingerprints of a director with young and heavy hands.What this film does get right is the pitch; cynicism is rampant and shows up consistently, there are no heroes.  Robe Lowe is perfectly cast as the completely soul-less super-agent, and the brief moments his assistant spends on screen are memorable.  The reliable Sam Elliott is note perfect - his moral outrage quivers visibly with the proximity of cash.  Robert Duvall, who by now could mail in a performance like this, is very comfortable as the ""Captain"" - tobacco industry ruler - and even seems to exhibit some remorse at the idea of killing his grand-daughter.  J.K. Simmons - a consistently excellent actor - is outstanding as BR, our protagonist's ruthless boss who pretty much epitomizes opportunism.  Katie Holmes as Heather Holloway is enchanting as she steals our hope that the fourth estate might be on a morally higher plane than everyone else in the miasma.The kidnapping episode, the book's lynch pin, is used, but abused, it seems to drop out of the air then conveniently disappear.  But that's not the film's overriding problem.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick is winning, but completely uninteresting.  Any engaging substance this film might have generated would have come from Nick's personality, and inner struggle with the facile way he bends truth.  Since we never see anything remotely resembling a personality, we can't like him or dislike him, we just look at him as a hideous reflection of what we've become, a symbol of the manipulative and disingenuous forces surrounding us.

While it's a rare thing that I can laugh at a Hollywood movie, it's even rarer when I can revel in it.""Very few people know what it is to be truly hated...""So begins the story of Nick Naylor, the Tobacco industry's chief lobbyist in Washington. From the conference room of the Academy of Tobacco Studies to the back room in a Washington restaurant, Nick is great at talking shop. And when the camera turns his way, he's always ready to carry the day by turning accepted wisdom on its head.""You know the guy who can pick up any girl? I'm him-on crack.""""Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk.""Yes, Mr Naylor is good at what he does and he knows it. In his line of work, it comes with the territory. But things are not quite so rosy for old Nick. He's divorced. He's trying to raise his son right despite his ex despising what he stands for. His ideas for his industry's future get ripped off by his boss. He's even got to go on the occasional trip to bribe former tobacco icons. And then there are the live TV death threats. Yet despite it all, Naylor remains upbeat enough to still go back into the lions' den and sit for interviews with anti-smoking crusaders on TV, newspapers and even in Congress.One of the things that makes this movie great is its casting. Aaron Eckhart gives a wonderful performance as Naylor, but the supporting cast is just as well considered. Cameron Bright gives a remarkably subtle performance as son Joey. Maria Bello and David Koechner are the perfect foils for one another as Naylor's lobbyist compatriots. Even Rob Lowe gives a shamelessly smooth performance as the Katzenberg-inspired agent Jeff Megall. When the score is tallied, you have a movie that does for lobbyists what ""Wag the Dog"" did for PR flacks, yet without the megawatt star power of Robert De Niro or Dustin Hoffman.I love this movie-it's a gem. Writer and first-time director Jason Reitman has definitely learned something good from his father, legendary ""Animal House"" producer and ""Ghostbusters"" director Ivan Reitman, about how to put together a movie that is both funny and subtle at the same time. Fox Searchlight has put together a pretty good streak of intelligent low-budget movies lately, and this is another notch in their belts. How good is it?

1008658,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000H0MKO2,Andrew Desmond,"[4, 8]","Let me be upfront, I loved this film!  It's original, quirky and funny.  An unusual mix in today's Hollywood.The essence of the film is the story of Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart.  He is a lobbyist for big tobacco.  Typically, such a person is to be reviled.  We all know that smoking is not good for your health.  So, how can anyone defend the indefensible?  Well, Nick does it with humour and he does a good job of it.  Nick is a man of great charisma notwithstanding the fact that his bosses are deemed by many to be the devil incarnate.If this film has a message it is that tolerance still has a place in our society.  All too often, individuals and groups think it is there right to impose their values on others.  Think not just tobacco, but anti-alcohol lobbyists, Christian vigilantes and environmentalists.  The list is almost endless.  These people think they know what is good for you even if you apparently don't.  To question these zealots is to leave oneself open to attack.  Only they know what is good for you and society.  There opinion matters.  Your opinion is of no value.""Thank You for Smoking"" is not an excuse for smoking.  Rather it is a black comedy about those who strive to make decisions for you.  The plot is quick paced and the acting is wonderful.  Eckhart is supported by Maria Bello as a liquor industry lobbyist and David Koechner as spokesman for the firearms industry.  Together they are ""merchants of death"".  They are also a very clever trio that works well as a unit.I'm sure the self-righteous amongst us will condemn this film.  Too bad!  Life entails risks that we can determine for ourselves.

Tobacco companies, gun manufacturers, alcohol producers and distributors, fast food chains.  All of these businesses are enormous and often villified (often times for good reason).  The lobbyists' job is to spin the facts into positive arguments for their employers or to make the opposition look bad.  Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is one such lobbyist, and he sure is good at it.Thank You For Smoking is narrated by Naylor, who refers to himself as a coked-up version of ""that guy who could pick up any girl at a party"".  Talking is what he's good at, and it seems to be the greatest job imaginable.  He didn't need an advanced degree to get his job, and yet he makes a considerable amount of money defending Big Tobacco from health organizations and the US government.  Naylor's boss is known simply as B.R. (J.K. Simmons), a tough-as-nails Vietnam veteran who gets results from his constant insults to his employees.  Nick is divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens) who is sick and tired of him always sweet-talking her, and, in a bit of irony, is now seeing a doctor.  Nick's son Joey (Cameron Bright), an impressionable young boy, begins to take an interest in his father's work, and shows that he may have inhereted his father's flair for persuasion.  Every week, Nick meets up with his two friends who are also lobbyists.  Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) work for the alcohol and gun lobbies, respectively.  Their conversations tend to focus on whose product kills the most people and the best ways to get around negative press.  The thing about Nick is that he knows that he's BSing people, but he needs to pay the mortgage somehow.The great thing about this movie is its shameless satire.  No one is safe; yeah, the tobacco company has a lot of shots taken at it, but it also skewers the government, Hollywood, and reporters.  Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) is made a fool of numerous times, and Naylor's ""cheese defense"" is priceless.  What's even more amazing about the film is that, due to the way he spins things, many of Nick's arguments for cigarettes really work (the car/airplane one he uses right before the cheese one don't work in my opinion though, but most of the others actually do, which is pretty scary).It's a shame that this movie is only getting a fairly limited release, which means that not a lot of people will see it.  I think that this is a movie that everyone should see at least once.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't so that people can learn from it, because it definitely does not preach, but because it's such a great satire.",5,Thank You For Making This Movie,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2701,"['Lobbyists', 'job', 'defend', 'defenseless', 'big', 'corporations', 'people', 'hate', 'Tobacco', 'companies', 'gun', 'manufacturers', 'alcohol', 'producers', 'distributors', 'fast', 'food', 'chains', 'businesses', 'are', 'enormous', 'often', 'villified', 'often', 'good', 'reason', 'lobbyists', 'job', 'spin', 'facts', 'positive', 'arguments', 'employers', 'make', 'opposition', 'look', 'bad', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'one', 'such', 'lobbyist', 'sure', 'good', 'it.Thank', 'Smoking', 'narrated', 'Naylor', 'who', 'coked-up', 'version', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'party', 'Talking', 'what', 'good', 'be', 'greatest', 'job', 'imaginable', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'advanced', 'degree', 'get', 'job', 'yet', 'considerable', 'amount', 'money', 'defending', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'health', 'organizations', 'US', 'government', 'Naylor', 'boss', 'known', 'simply', 'B.R', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'tough-as-nails', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'who', 'results', 'constant', 'insults', 'employees', 'Nick', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'who', 'sick', 'tired', 'always', 'sweet-talking', 'bit', 'irony', 'now', 'seeing', 'doctor', 'Nick', 'son', 'Joey', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'impressionable', 'young', 'boy', 'take', 'interest', 'father', 'work', 'may', 'have', 'inhereted', 'father', 'flair', 'persuasion', 'week', 'Nick', 'up', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'lobbyists', 'Polly', 'Bailey', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Bobby', 'Jay', 'Bliss', 'David', 'Koechner', 'work', 'alcohol', 'gun', 'lobbies', 'respectively', 'conversations', 'tend', 'focus', 'product', 'most', 'people', 'best', 'ways', 'get', 'around', 'negative', 'press', 'thing', 'Nick', 'BSing', 'people', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'shameless', 'satire', 'one', 'safe', 'yeah', 'tobacco', 'company', 'lot', 'shots', 'taken', 'also', 'government', 'Hollywood', 'reporters', 'Vermont', 'Senator', 'Ortolan', 'Finistirre', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'made', 'fool', 'numerous', 'times', 'Naylor', 'cheese', 'defense', 'priceless', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'film', 'due', 'way', 'things', 'many', 'Nick', 'arguments', 'cigarettes', 'really', 'work', 'car/airplane', 'one', 'right', 'cheese', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'opinion', 'most', 'others', 'actually', 'do', 'pretty', 'scary', '.It', 'shame', 'movie', 'only', 'getting', 'fairly', 'limited', 'release', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'think', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'so', 'people', 'can', 'learn', 'definitely', 'not', 'preach', 'such', 'great', 'satire']",N/A

Friendly but competitive chats of this ""M.O.D. Squad"" often entail how many die annually from products they espouse, the point being: the more dangerous the product, the more lofty its spokesman's mission.Nick is fearless in his defense of Big Tobacco. On panel shows, he runs smoke rings around cancer patients, scientific studies and experts who declare that cigarettes are deadly. When tasked with increasing movie product placement to supplement his employers' new ""smoking is cool"" campaign, Nick takes his adoring 12-year-old son (Bright) along so he can watch daddy in action.Eventually, Big T's front man grows a conscience, albeit not a fully developed one. He grudgingly admits to the hazards of smoking but hedges by falling back on the right of ADULTS to choose and the personal responsibility this entails. The correct message is sent when a horrified Nick instinctively knocks a lit ciggie from his boy's mouth during an impromptu press conference.Of special note are Robert Duvall's amusing caricature of a tobacco company CEO, William H. Macy's virulently anti-smoking senator from Vermont, Rob Lowe as a kimono-clad Hollywood producer and Sam Elliott's cancer-stricken yet mercenary Marlboro Man. Snickering laughs and intelligent dialogue are plentiful in this well-paced film.

This movie should have been done especially after Michael Mann's The Insider, just to show us the ""other side"", to hear arguments of the people who have a right to be heard as everyone else in any free country. And in its cynicism and recklessness Thank You For Smoking came out to be extremely ruffian-like and hilarious as for example People VS Larry Flynt or Private Parts. You can't resist admiring this picture as girls usually can't resist bad guys' charm. What's even more preposterous and outrageous, but inevitable I guess, is that you feel empathy for Aaron Eckhart's character, a character who earns money by persuading people into smoking, who profits from others' misery if you will. You like his character. I just loved him! He is smart enough to prove his point even if he's wrong, more than that - he's smart enough to persuade people to do something they absolutely don't need to do. He's the ultimate puppeteer, a Dr. Evil. You'll ask how it is possible to admire such person? But see, he doesn't put cigarettes into anyone's mouth, people do it themselves, and only they are to blame. We usually tend to blame everyone else in our misfortune, but it's us and only us who is responsible. I smoke myself, but if I get ill of it I'll never start blaming a tobacco industry - I have my own head on my shoulders to make decisions. In another words if people are fools it's nobody's fault except their own. And if you can manupulate people with a spoken word you're a genious, and I personally admire such persons. And this film is not about proving the point that smoking is good, Aaron Eckhart's character says himself he doesn't think smoking is good, he just thinks everybody is entitled to his own opinion and has a right to share it with others. It's parents' and schools' business to educate and teach to distinguish right from wrong.There was only one thing that seemed strange at first glance in this film. Just imagine - it's a movie about smoking, but there's no single person smoking on screen throughout the entire picture! Was that an attempt to make the flick politically correct or director Jason Reitman's deliberate concept? I think it's rather the second, and if it's really like this it's extremely funny. I also had a feeling about the film trying to seem politically correct, when Aaron Eckhart's character quit his job as a tobacco lobbyist in the end. But moments later we see him explaining to some executives in a mobile phones company there is no evidence phones cause brain tumor.

Eckhart's great charm and enthusiasm invigorates a story that may not be plot-heavy but is laced with wry observance and sharp asides, one-liners and telling character details.Fast and light on its feet, the film benefits by a first rate cast turning in nicely nuanced turns, and congratulations to Jason Reitman and his backers for keeping the film true to its vision and not allowing it to go soft and mushy or copping-out in any sense all the way to its conclusion.Amazingly, every once and awhile one of these films comes along that gets made the way it should, and is allowed to remain intact and un-Hollywoodized or otherwise reduced to mass comfortability.

Aaron Eckhart plays Nick Naylor who is a VP and ""chief talking head"" for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.The Academy is supposed to research the link between nicotine and cancer.  Who would have thought that they would never find any connection?Nick gets himself into trouble with his ""flexible morals"" and his errant lobbying ways; but never loses the support of his young son Joey,  played by Cameron Bright (despite what his ex wife calls his ""dependency issues"").This is a great satirical piece; it was based upon a novel by Christopher Buckley and was the first full feature film directed by Jason Reitman (of Juno fame).In terms of sensitivities, the film has little.  This is not an endorsement of the cigarette industry; but it still does present a callous view of the deep sufferings of many (all caused by nicotine).  If this does not hit close to home for you, the satire is well done and Naylor learns a lesson about the emancipation of those enslaved by nicotine himself in a not so presidential manner.Nick swaps horses; but doesn't seem to have lost any of his stripes by the end of the flick.

The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise I've ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting do-gooders and do-badders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you don't laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.Young Jason Reitman's direction and screenplay are deft and light. He is never heavy-handed, or worse, condescending (as might have happened once or twice in WAG THE DOG). Based on a novel by Christopher Buckley (the son of William F. Buckley), the script is the star here. The double, triple, and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a star-studded ensemble cast, who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Every reviewer opines that this will be Aaron Eckhart's break-out role. With his Dudley-Do-Right face and ""that guy who always gets the girl----- on crack"" charm and glibness, his Nick Naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctor's prescription: ""the means justify the end"".The casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director. Rob Lowe as the ""genius"" behind Hollywood ""EGO"", a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement, is note-perfect in a ""small role"". With William H. Macy, the Vermont Senator who takes on the tobacco industry, Maria Bello, a fellow Merchant of Death lobbyist, and Robert Duvall, the ""Captain"" of this particular industry--- the cast is jaw-dropping, and sublimely funny.  Katie Holmes, pre-TomKat, is gorgeous, seductive, and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her story.Nick Naylor's relationship with his son is the lens which focuses Nick on his own behavior. Even that relationship is neither treated as a clich&eacute;, nor completely reverently by the satirist, who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our self-righteousness.

It's all about twisting the truth, being supposedly ""fair and balanced,"" and dealing with spin... and counter-spin. In fact, this movie could have just as easily been titled ""Lobbyists and Politics in the USA"" although that wouldn't have been quite so catchy... and the movie is all about techniques used to catch the public's attention, sway the opinions of the masses, and make your opponents look inept and dishonest.It's hard to say if the protagonist (Nick Naylor played by Eckhart) is a hero or an anti-hero. He cuts through as much BS as he produces. Involving Naylor's 12-year-old son in the plot was a brilliant device to force the protagonist to confront the true nature of his lobbying efforts and I'm glad to say that the writer didn't take the easy way out by having the protagonist renunciate his role as a lobbyist for big tobacco. (Those who see this movie as being primarily about the tobacco industry are likely to miss some of its allegorical potential. For instance, the Bush administration bears a tremendous number of similarities to big tobacco as portrayed in this movie.)The version of the DVD that I purchased includes many valuable Special Features that help elucidate the making of the movie. It includes extensive commentary, deleted scenes, and an interview with Charlie Rose. The deleted scenes includes an alternative ending where the protagonist does compromise the integrity of his character (by plucking a cigarette out of his son's mouth in public), but fortunately the director selected a more challenging ending.",4,Lobbyists and Politics in the USA,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,1664,"['Thank', 'Smoking', 'topic', 'smoking', 'explore', 'how', 'political', 'system', 'United', 'States', 'twisting', 'truth', 'being', 'supposedly', 'fair', 'balanced', 'dealing', 'spin', 'counter-spin', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'titled', 'Lobbyists', 'Politics', 'USA', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'catchy', 'movie', 'techniques', 'used', 'catch', 'public', 'attention', 'sway', 'opinions', 'masses', 'make', 'opponents', 'look', 'inept', 'dishonest.It', 'hard', 'say', 'protagonist', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'played', 'Eckhart', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'as', 'much', 'BS', 'Involving', 'Naylor', '12-year-old', 'son', 'plot', 'was', 'brilliant', 'device', 'force', 'protagonist', 'confront', 'true', 'nature', 'lobbying', 'efforts', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'having', 'protagonist', 'renunciate', 'role', 'lobbyist', 'big', 'tobacco', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'being', 'primarily', 'tobacco', 'industry', 'are', 'likely', 'miss', 'allegorical', 'potential', 'instance', 'Bush', 'administration', 'tremendous', 'number', 'similarities', 'big', 'tobacco', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'version', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'many', 'valuable', 'Special', 'Features', 'help', 'elucidate', 'making', 'movie', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interview', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternative', 'ending', 'where', 'protagonist', 'compromise', 'integrity', 'character', 'plucking', 'cigarette', 'son', 'mouth', 'public', 'fortunately', 'director', 'selected', 'more', 'challenging', 'ending']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 5]","There's something to be said for a film that makes no apologies for being completely politically incorrect, and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING certainly has something to say.That audiences may find themselves cheering on ""the bad guy"" will make this movie all the more entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (SUSPECT ZERO) stars as Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the tobacco companies, and he's very good at what he does. One of his sayings is ""If you argue well enough, you're never wrong."" The moral flexibility Nick has is akin to an ethical gymnast. But his son Joey (Cameron Blight, ULTRAVIOLET) is growing up fast and is learning the ways of the father. We see Nick navigating these parental waters with a touch of dignity and a splash of chagrin. Can he be a good father while towing the line for the tobacco companies and telling everyone that cigarettes are a personal choice rather than a death sentence?William H. Macy (EDMOND) stars as Senator Finistirre, ""the good guy"" who is trying to get a skull and crossbones image stamped on every carton of cigarettes. But he's also a politician, trying to further his own career. He represents a state that produces tons of fatty cheeses, thus adding to Americans weight and cholesterol problems. And he most certainly isn't above taking campaign contributions from businesses, is he?That the film is filled with contradictions and hilarious moral dilemmas is a tribute to the author of the book, Christopher Buckley. That he can turn the tables on alcohol, tobacco and firearms (all of which are addressed in the name of ""business"") is a testament to some damn fine writing.What makes the movie work so well is Aaron Eckhart's affable portrayal of Nick. He's so darn likeable yet utterly incomprehensible (in the moral sense) that the audience will be grudgingly cheering him on. That he can out-maneuver his opponent (Macy) makes the movie-watcher dislike whom they really should be cheering for! What a turnabout!The ensemble cast is incredible, too. In addition to Eckhart, Macy and Blight, there's Mario Bello (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE), Sam Elliot (TOMBSTONE), Katie Holmes (PIECES OF APRIL), Rob Lowe (THE WEST WING, TV series), Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE), and quite a few other notables.This film must certainly be on people's top-ten list of movies to watch ...if they haven't caught it already.",5,No Apologies,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,2333,"['something', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'apologies', 'being', 'completely', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'SMOKING', 'certainly', 'something', 'say.That', 'audiences', 'may', 'find', 'cheering', 'bad', 'guy', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'SUSPECT', 'ZERO', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'lobbyist', 'tobacco', 'companies', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'One', 'sayings', 'argue', 'well', 'enough', ""'re"", 'never', 'wrong', 'moral', 'flexibility', 'Nick', 'akin', 'ethical', 'gymnast', 'son', 'Joey', 'Cameron', 'Blight', 'ULTRAVIOLET', 'growing', 'up', 'fast', 'learning', 'ways', 'father', 'see', 'Nick', 'navigating', 'parental', 'waters', 'touch', 'dignity', 'splash', 'chagrin', 'Can', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'towing', 'line', 'tobacco', 'companies', 'telling', 'everyone', 'cigarettes', 'are', 'personal', 'choice', 'rather', 'death', 'sentence', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'EDMOND', 'Senator', 'Finistirre', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'skull', 'crossbones', 'image', 'stamped', 'carton', 'cigarettes', 'also', 'politician', 'trying', 'further', 'own', 'career', 'state', 'tons', 'fatty', 'cheeses', 'thus', 'adding', 'Americans', 'weight', 'cholesterol', 'problems', 'most', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'taking', 'campaign', 'contributions', 'businesses', 'film', 'filled', 'contradictions', 'hilarious', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'tribute', 'author', 'book', 'Christopher', 'Buckley', 'can', 'turn', 'tables', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'firearms', 'are', 'addressed', 'name', 'business', 'testament', 'damn', 'fine', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'affable', 'portrayal', 'Nick', 'so', 'darn', 'likeable', 'yet', 'utterly', 'incomprehensible', 'moral', 'sense', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'grudgingly', 'cheering', 'can', 'out-maneuver', 'opponent', 'Macy', 'movie-watcher', 'dislike', 'whom', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'cheering', 'What', 'turnabout', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'incredible', 'too', 'addition', 'Eckhart', 'Macy', 'Blight', 'Mario', 'Bello', 'A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'TOMBSTONE', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'PIECES', 'OF', 'APRIL', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WING', 'TV', 'series', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'THE', 'APOSTLE', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'notables.This', 'film', 'must', 'certainly', 'be', 'people', 'top-ten', 'list', 'movies', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'already']",N/A

Occasionally while reading it there was a slight movement of my lips that could be interpreted as the very beginning of a smile. Chris, old buddy, you really let me down with this one I thought when I finished it.One day in an inexplicably strange mood I decided to buy the DVD. Let me say at the onset that I totally love black humor. Perhaps I thought that maybe the screenplay would include some great black humor. I don't know. I do know that while watching the movie my lips began to move again. A laugh? No, a yawn.First of all the anti hero of the story is a shallow, empty person who has only one talent: the ability to spin, and he is quite good at that. I kept saying to him as I watched him: ""Go away, get out of my living room."" Mind you I can tolerate evil characters; Shakespeare created a lot of them, and some of them are deliciously evil. But this guy? He's a cipher that is so concscienceless that he takes his young son with him on his travels so that he can learn the trade of being a facile liar. Son becomes quite proud of dad. Our hero is so hated by the public (including, perhaps, most of the movie audience) that he is kidnapped and plastered from head to toe with nicotine patches. I kept thinking ""die, die.""Most of the humor in the movie concerns listening to spin. Don't we get enough spin in our everyday life? Why is this funny? No one in the whole movie has a soul, neither the tobacco executives, the hollywood agent, the pretty lady newspaper reporter (who beds our spinmeister so that he will reveal all), the liquor industry spokeslady, the NRA spinner, or the young son. This undoubtedly is part of the message to us, but I can't quite understand the concept of let's show a bunch of shallow people, and do it in a very shallow way. Yes that surely will make us all laugh.The humor too subtle for me? Well I do like black humor that does come crashing down on me, but I do think this flick is farce without the funny.

There's really no need to point out that it's a political satire; the title alone makes that perfectly clear, and for that, we can thank Christopher Buckley for writing the original novel. This is a movie that couldn't have been released in any other period of film history; only recently has American society planted such an obsessive focus on health within the mainstream consciousness, and only now is it falling on deaf ears. (Don't believe me? Just look at the stats on obesity to see what I mean.) What better time is there to examine the various stances on health, especially when it comes to smoking? Granted, it's a humorous examination, but if you stop and think about it, the way that opposing groups go about defending themselves--which in this case involve the tobacco industry and anti-smoking parties--is shamefully comedic. Maybe a movie like this will help people understand just what goes into arguing for a particular side and gaining the upper hand through persuasion.And when it comes to persuasiveness, no one is better at it than Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a smooth talking tobacco lobbyist who knows just how to get a point across. He works for a company headed by Budd ""BR"" Rohrabacher (J.K. Simmons); a hardheaded boss-type who only cares about financial success. Naylor doesn't seem to mind that he's one of the most hated men in America (at one point during Dennis Miller's call in talk show, an anonymous caller claims that Naylor is going to suffer). He also doesn't care that he's promoting a product that kills thousands of people a day. According to him, it's all about ""paying the mortgage,"" making a living only because it's necessary for survival. Talking is just something he happens to be good at, and what better way to use that skill than in defense of a powerful (and some would say evil) corporate entity? In today's day and age, they certainly need all the help they can get.Naylor is but one lobbyist seen in this film. He regularly dines with spokespeople from two other controversial industries: Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), who represents alcohol; and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), who represents guns. The three call themselves the MOD Squad (meaning Merchants of Death), and they always seem to be conversing on how to work with the system in order to get their unpopular messages out to the public. One piece of advice Bliss has is to be careful around female reporters with nice looking breasts; while it may appear pleasing on camera, it can result in a potentially damaging scenario. Naylor finds this out the hard way when he gets physically involved with Heather Halloway (Katie Holmes), a reporter with an agenda.Things get complicated when Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy) launches a new campaign aimed at putting a permanent dent in the tobacco industry's goals. The idea is to print a gruesome skull-and-crossbones logo on every pack of cigarettes; maybe then people will understand that inhaling a puff of smoke is akin to inhaling poison. In order to fight against this, Naylor suggests using movies as a tool to make cigarettes appealing again. It would be like it was in the old days of Hollywood, when stars like Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis made smoking seem sexy. What follows is one of the wittiest representations of movie industry-banter I've ever seen. Naylor flies to Los Angeles to meet with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), the head of a talent agency called Entertainment Global Operations (or EGO, if you get the joke). The two decide to make a science fiction film and have a brand of cigarettes tie in with its release. Supposedly, the product would be featured during an interstellar sex scene between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta Jones.But there's more to ""Thank You For Smoking"" than feuding industries. This is also a very human story, and it shows through the interaction between Naylor and his twelve-year-old son, Joey (Cameron Bright). He's a smart, articulate young man who seems genuinely interested in what his father does for a living, not so much in what he endorses but in how he endorses it. A couple of very important scenes show them engaged in fascinating conversations; basically, Joey wants to understand the methodology behind arguing and winning an argument (which is a skill he's rapidly developing). He also just wants to spend more time with his father, which is why he goes with him on his business trips. This is something that Naylor's ex-wife, Jill (Kim Dickens), has never been thrilled with. However, she does recognize the good relationship they share.There's also an intriguing subplot involving Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliot), the former Marlboro man (who supposedly only smoked Kools). The fact that he's dying of cancer has understandably made him bitter and resentful towards Big Tobacco, and because of this, Naylor is sent with a suitcase full of cash. Hopefully, this will get Lutch to keep quiet for the remainder of his life. Obviously I can't say whether or not the money is accepted, but I will say that the thought process behind the decision is quite original. Naylor's people skills are used to their full extent during this scene, especially in the way he weighs Lutch's options.I think what makes ""Thank You For Smoking"" so entertaining is its refreshing honesty and its uncompromising commentaries on American business. And despite what some may think, it's not a film that attempts to label any political stance as right or wrong; neither side is entirely correct just as neither side is entirely incorrect. It's enough to make one think about the decisions we make. Are we influenced to try something dangerous, or are we able to make up our own minds? There are no easy answers to those questions, and that's exactly the point this film is trying to make. Its ability to look beyond previously conceived notions made this a worthwhile experience. I urge anyone of moral conviction to see it; it may just make you look at your ideals in an entirely different light.",5,Big Tobacco Has Never Been So Witty,1145059200,"04 15,

Sure I had a couple but they never once became an addiction. Ironically there are people out there whose sole job it is is to get people to smoke. Criticized for having no moral compass, they basically smooth talk their way into media's hearts by saying the wrong words the right way. As Aaron Eckhart's character says, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong. That is the basic for this film: nobody is really right or wrong, it's just a question of who sounds the most convincing.Eckhart plays Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies whose basic job is to downplay the dangers of tobacco and smoking and turn things around in their favor. He doesn't necessarily lie, he just makes the truth sound so cool. But when politicians want to put a more grim warning label on cigarettes, Naylor is called into action but a reporter has that come crashing down and he has to once again, talk his way out of rough waters.A film like this usually rests on one actor, unlike most where it's an ensemble film. Eckhart is one of those kind of actors that he's so good when he's actually given a good part to play although roles in Paycheck and the Core were at least watchable but here he kind of flexes his muscles. The rest of the cast is great as well with funny cameos from Adam Brody of the O.C, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot as the Marlboro Man. The only thing about some of the cast members is that they do feel like cameos with Naylor's ex dating a doctor that practically appears in 2 scenes and Katie Holmes as the reporter just feels miscast (someone like Rachel McAdams would've been perfect).What's enjoyable about the film is that not only is it funny (one favorite is the senator who wants to eliminate all incidents of cigarettes from movies, complete with hilarious alternatives) but it never really feels like an anti-smoking ad in the guise of a film. It argues its pro-smoking points just as well as its anti-smoking ones and leaves it to the viewer to figure out who seems better to you. If its got any faults is that when we start to learn more about Nick the man and not Nick the silver-tongued man on a mission, it doesn't really have the energy when the film ramps up in satire.I'm not sure if you'll end up buying this, but it's a great rental and up to you whether to completely go ahead and buy it.

It is the anti-smoking government agency who profits with a bigger budget if the boy dies.Naylor is divorced.  His ex-wife is living in what used to be his house with their son, Joey, and her boyfriend.  When Nick goes to career day and greets Joey on the way to the front, the boy whispers a plea begging Nick to not ruin his childhood.I don't want to take away the enjoyment of discovering this wonderful plot from you, but one of the great bits in the story is the weekly lunch Nick has with his friends who are lobbyists for the liquor and gun industries.

I thoroughly enjoyed the book TYFS, which I still rate as one of Christopher Buckley's best.  In movie form TYFS is even more impactful, due to the stronger sensory experience of the cinema, while being equally funny and insightful - but not, of course, as pleasingly long or in-depth.What makes TYFS succeed so brilliantly is Buckley's satirical behind-the-scenes view of how Washington politics and politicians work, and what they say, feel and do, both in public and behind closed doors (which, of course, is quite a contrast).  Although certain scenes in TYFS are a bit over-the-top, and one might quibble with certain things the characters say and do, one gets the sense that there is a lot more truth about our political system in TYFS than there is in today's 6 o'clock evening news.Movie writer/director Jason Reitman faithfully transfers Buckley's views to the silver screen, and the production values of TYFS are top-notch.  Aaron Eckhart us simply amazing as lead character Nick Naylor: he is perfectly cast as the handsome, well-spoken lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry, and he gives a great performance.  The supporting cast also turns in a series of fine performances: notable are Katie Holmes as an unscrupulous investigative reporter, Maria Bello as a fellow lobbyist (for the alcoholic beverages industry), Robert Duvall as the patriarch of the tobacco industry, and Sam Elliott as the original Marlboro Man.  The settings and cinematography are outstanding, and the producers even got Joan Lunden and Dennis Miller for a couple of talk show scenes.

1008691,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000H0MKO2,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","`Thank You for Smoking' is one of the funniest and freshest comedies I've seen in a long time.  It's smart and witty and capitalizes on its assets brilliantly, leading Aaron Eckhart to what has to be is greatest performance to date (a Golden Globe nod should be a lock at this point).  As Nick Naylor, Eckhart is smart, effective and confident as the voice behind big tobacco.  He's so into his job that he even goes as far as to somewhat promote smoking to his son's elementary class.  Nick regularly meets with his fellow lobbyists (David Koechner & Maria Bello) for lunch, donning the name MOD squad (merchants of death), where they discuss and or compete for the greatest death count.When Nick becomes involved with a reporter (Katie Holmes at her most delicious...screw you Tom Cruise) things slowly spiral out of control, and as his son (Cameron Bright) becomes all the more interested in his fathers line of work Nick begins to wonder if he's really setting the right example for his son.  He goes from shameless to selfless by the end of the film, but he does it all with his confident yet cocky demeanor.  The film was a riot, I mean utterly hysterical from start to finish (Rob Lowe was brilliant as the Asian obsessed motion picture tycoon...I mean that whole Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones discussion was priceless), and it was original enough to deem itself worthy of multiple viewings.

1008692,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000H0MKO2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","This is an intelligent, excellent satirical film, so don't get caught up in the title, for I think it can be misleading.  Smokers, for example, will likely suspect this film of being a vengeful attempt to make Big Tobacco look like Satan's most loyal servants, while anti-tobacco's attack dogs may suspect some hidden agenda to actually make smoking look cool.  Neither would be correct.  Thank You For Smoking launches its barbs into both sides of the tobacco conflict, shining a good bit of the harsh light of truth onto both.  No matter which side you're on, you can enjoy this brilliant little film.The sad fact is that the debate over smoking oftentimes has nothing to do with cigarettes; it's really all about money and power and politics.  Look at Al Gore, who could cry about the loss of his sister to cancer even as he profited from tobacco, or Bill Clinton (who did things with a cigar that even Big Tobacco would never condone), whose attack on Big Tobacco conveniently served him as a smokescreen to distract the public from his many personal problems.  Obviously, many people do oppose smoking for very sincere reasons, but some politicians jump on board merely as a means to power and influence.  In this movie, they're represented by Vermont's Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy), who is leading the effort to put a large poison label on cigarettes.  He's not exactly all heart, though: berating his assistant for not choosing someone obviously on death's door for his ""cancer boy,"" lamenting the fact that one of his enemies didn't actually die after being attacked by anti-smoking vigilantes, and generally engaging in the same kind of self-profiting spin as the representatives of Big Tobacco.Finistirre's nemesis is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the smooth-talking de facto spokesman for the tobacco industry.  Eckhart's brilliant performance keeps the film far away from the many pitfalls that would seem to dominate the landscape for this kind of satire.  Naylor is almost untouchably good at his job, able to deftly and quickly take a hostile crowd and win them over (or at least stave them off) with his defense of freedom and personal choice in America.  What does he do what he does?  That's never definitively answered, but paying the mortgage is alluded to by Nick and several other characters.  One thing that Nick alone has, however, is a human and sympathetic persona, as revealed in his relationship with his son.  The presence of the boy adds to the story's otherwise absurdist atmosphere, as we watch the boy look up to and begin to emulate his father's debating skills.  More than that, it shows us a human side to Nick, and that is something this film almost had to have in order to succeed.Nick's character is sort of morally ambivalent, but you can't help but like him - and he certainly comes off in a better light than Senator Finistirre and a certain reporter played (passably at best) by Katie Holmes.  Nick should have known better than to sleep with a journalist, as Heather Holloway goes about doing her job much the same way Nick goes about doing his.  Her only concern is the story and the attention it will bring her.  She and Finistirre, much more than Nick and his fellow spokesmen from the alcohol and firearms industries (who jokingly refer to themselves as the MOD [Merchants of Death] Squad and argue over which of their products is more deadly) are the real villains of the story.  Even if and when they might do the right thing, they do it for all the wrong reasons.  Nick may engineer good spin for Big Tobacco, but at least he doesn't pretend to be someone he isn't.The film features a surprisingly good cast (excepting Katie Holmes, of course, whose ""steamy"" scene with Eckhart is almost too far away from the camera to be seen with the naked eye), including the likes of Eckhart, Elliott, Macy, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, and - in a really funny cameo - Dennis Miller.  Jason Reitman may be a young filmmaker, but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film.  Making a film about Big Tobacco that never deviates from its satirical position to moralize either for or against smoking, skewers all concerned parties equally, defies the dangerous modern-day obsession with political correctness, and maintains a consistently intelligent, funny atmosphere throughout, is quite an accomplishment indeed.  Unless you simply can't take a joke (or you're the reviewer from the LA Times or some similar leftist rag), you're going to enjoy this movie.",5,A brilliant satire that smokers and non-smokers alike can enjoy,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,4518,"['intelligent', 'excellent', 'satirical', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'title', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'misleading', 'Smokers', 'example', 'will', 'likely', 'suspect', 'film', 'being', 'vengeful', 'attempt', 'make', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'look', 'Satan', 'most', 'loyal', 'servants', 'anti-tobacco', 'attack', 'dogs', 'may', 'suspect', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'actually', 'make', 'smoking', 'look', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'correct', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'launches', 'barbs', 'sides', 'tobacco', 'conflict', 'shining', 'good', 'bit', 'harsh', 'light', 'truth', 'matter', 'side', ""'re"", 'can', 'enjoy', 'brilliant', 'little', 'film.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'debate', 'smoking', 'oftentimes', 'nothing', 'do', 'cigarettes', 'really', 'money', 'power', 'politics', 'Look', 'Al', 'Gore', 'who', 'could', 'cry', 'loss', 'sister', 'cancer', 'even', 'profited', 'tobacco', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'who', 'did', 'things', 'cigar', 'even', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'would', 'never', 'condone', 'attack', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'conveniently', 'served', 'smokescreen', 'distract', 'public', 'many', 'personal', 'problems', 'Obviously', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'oppose', 'smoking', 'very', 'sincere', 'reasons', 'politicians', 'jump', 'board', 'merely', 'means', 'power', 'influence', 'movie', ""'re"", 'represented', 'Vermont', 'Senator', 'Ortolan', 'K.', 'Finistirre', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'leading', 'effort', 'put', 'large', 'poison', 'label', 'cigarettes', 'not', 'exactly', 'heart', 'berating', 'assistant', 'not', 'choosing', 'someone', 'obviously', 'death', 'door', 'cancer', 'boy', 'lamenting', 'fact', 'one', 'enemies', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'die', 'being', 'attacked', 'anti-smoking', 'vigilantes', 'generally', 'engaging', 'same', 'kind', 'self-profiting', 'spin', 'representatives', 'Big', 'Tobacco.Finistirre', 'nemesis', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'smooth-talking', 'de', 'facto', 'spokesman', 'tobacco', 'industry', 'Eckhart', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'film', 'far', 'away', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'would', 'seem', 'dominate', 'landscape', 'kind', 'satire', 'Naylor', 'almost', 'untouchably', 'good', 'job', 'able', 'deftly', 'quickly', 'take', 'hostile', 'crowd', 'win', 'over', 'least', 'stave', 'off', 'defense', 'freedom', 'personal', 'choice', 'America', 'What', 'do', 'what', 'never', 'definitively', 'answered', 'paying', 'mortgage', 'alluded', 'Nick', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'One', 'thing', 'Nick', 'alone', 'however', 'human', 'sympathetic', 'persona', 'revealed', 'relationship', 'son', 'presence', 'boy', 'story', 'otherwise', 'absurdist', 'atmosphere', 'watch', 'boy', 'look', 'begin', 'emulate', 'father', 'debating', 'skills', 'More', 'human', 'side', 'Nick', 'something', 'film', 'almost', 'had', 'have', 'order', 'succeed.Nick', 'character', 'sort', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'certainly', 'off', 'better', 'light', 'Senator', 'Finistirre', 'certain', 'reporter', 'played', 'passably', 'best', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Nick', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'sleep', 'journalist', 'Heather', 'Holloway', 'doing', 'job', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Nick', 'doing', 'only', 'concern', 'story', 'attention', 'will', 'bring', 'Finistirre', 'much', 'more', 'Nick', 'fellow', 'spokesmen', 'alcohol', 'firearms', 'industries', 'who', 'jokingly', 'refer', 'MOD', '[', 'Merchants', 'Death', ']', 'Squad', 'argue', 'products', 'more', 'deadly', 'are', 'real', 'villains', 'story', 'Even', 'when', 'might', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Nick', 'may', 'engineer', 'good', 'spin', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'least', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'someone', 'film', 'features', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'cast', 'excepting', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'course', 'steamy', 'scene', 'Eckhart', 'almost', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'camera', 'be', 'seen', 'naked', 'eye', 'including', 'likes', 'Eckhart', 'Elliott', 'Macy', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'really', 'funny', 'cameo', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'may', 'be', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'nailed', 'just', 'aspect', 'film', 'Making', 'film', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'never', 'satirical', 'position', 'moralize', 'smoking', 'skewers', 'concerned', 'parties', 'equally', 'dangerous', 'modern-day', 'obsession', 'political', 'correctness', 'consistently', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'indeed', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'joke', ""'re"", 'reviewer', 'LA', 'Times', 'similar', 'leftist', 'rag', ""'re"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

Then there are the surrounding characters ranging from a Vermont Senator to a tobacco baron to a couple of other lobbyists who represent alcohol companies and gun manufacturers.

The plot races along as Nick falls in with a foxy reporter who takes him to bed and the cleaners when she reveals his behind-the-scenes machinations.

Because it seems like every time I go to the movies I remember back to one of the classics in literature that I callously never read.  It was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal I thought back on after finishing THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, because I now realize that modern satire is joke.Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt, In The Company of Men)  is as smooth as the cigarettes he's promoting.  As the main lobbyist for big tobacco, it's his job to look America in the eye and say ""Want to smoke.""  The film follows him as he convinces group after group that Big Tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains.  There are bumps along the way, including a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy), a nosy journalist (Katie Holmes), and a few attempts on his life.  But with some good old American B.S. he may just make it.THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is an almost biting satire, it presents all the characters a great satire needs, and it's full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it.  But squanders them by playing too safe, by not taking sides, and by coping out at the last moment.  Great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical, psychological, or farcical bloodbath. Like in Swift's A Modest Proposal, where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism.  The hero of the story should be standing next to God, or burning in hell for his misdeeds.  THANK YOU FOR SMOKING just winks at you, provides a couple of laughs, and that's all.The major problem is that the screenplay, by Jason Reitman (who also directs), falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything.  That's would be fine, but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victory's seem paltry.  His Villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound.  Satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointless.As for the performances they just sit there.  No one is big enough.  That actors wander in and out of each scene, and the only one we really get to know is Nick.  But Nick is not that vulnerable, even when the script tries to paint him that way.  Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once.  Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie.  It's pretty funny and  It's quite timely.  But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches.

I wanted Sandra Oh to suffer for making me suffer throught that film. However, a lot of people liked ""Sideways"". A lot of people also like ""Prarie Home Companion"" and think that ""Dilbert"" is among the great mines of caustic wit. These are the people who will enjoy ""Thank You for Smoking"". For everyone else, I've written several good reasons for you to avoid this movie.1) The film doesn't work as satire because it's too unfocused and tries to make everyone happy. Why not a scating rebuke of the tobacco industry and leave it at that? Why make everyone and everything (and I do mean everything) a target? Don't believe me? Allow me to whip out my ""Easy Target"" checklist - TYFS has evil corporations, silly feel-good anti-freedom liberals, politicians, Hollywood kiss-up Assistants, out of touch Left-coast new age ""industry types"", smarmy lobbyists, whiny intellectuals, and finally THE MEDIA!!! Those unethical journalists who only pretent to love you until they get the story. Like that guy who *said* that he worked for the Penny Saver and told me that he loved me until. . .nevermind.2) The tobacco industry, its influence, and how it's evil? Really? Why not a satirical piece about how we stole land from the indians? Or maybe a satire about the Kennedy Administration? Or the Iran-Contra affair? Probably because they aren't timely and people wouldn't care - and good satire (espescially when it isn't cleverly couched in a more metaphorical context) needs to be timely, even in the case of a film that deals with events past - the subject matter itself needs to be timely (i.e. Three Kings, Barbarians at the Gates). Which is why The Daily Show works so well now, but old episodes (say from 7 or 8 years ago) are as funny as trip and fall down a long, unfunny staircase. This movie just felt stale and its satirical choppers, therefore, had no bite. What remained was:3) Postmodernism - postmodernism, or the grating self-awareness of watching and, in the case of Mr. Eckhart, being in a movie coupled with overdose levels of irony and the big pat on the back to the audience that ""you guys all get it. If you laugh at the movie, you get it. You know that corporations are bad and evil and, unlike every character in this film, you are a young, hip, aware, educated moviegoer who is savvy enough to figure it out"". Postmodernism makes you feel good for wasting your life in front of a television or knowing anything at all about our culture. Specifically, this film (if you think about it) was fairly devoid of plot - I mean, when you think about it, its all right there in the trailer. In other words, completely by the numbers (but by the numbers of other films that share the same basic structure - i.e. company man who realizes that there are things more important than his evil,evil career helping save ""The Man"") to the point that it lazily doesn't even bother playing out the protagonist's redemption. Rather, you get the following: freeze frame on A.E. at that critical moment followed by dialogue: ""I bet you think I took the job and the money, I didn't. Some things are more important"". Cut to shot of his son (A.K.A. creepy child from that Nicole Kidman movie where he claims to be her dead husband) riding in car. In fact, there's no enlightenment in this age of Truth commercials and anti-corporate flag waving. We get it, corporations are bad. They want our money and don't care about us. But a movie about a tobacco lobbyist who's all smarm and teeth. Sweet baby jeebus, it's one Leslie Neilsen away from a spoof.The reason the film worked is because you've seen it before in its other incarnations. Which isn't a crime - a lot of movies do that. But I have a tendency to not call out the ones that do it well. This had a few well placed jokes, but it didn't have any teeth. I didn't leave feeling enlightened, and didn't feel that A.E. was some kind of power lobbyist. For example, that he won over a Senate hearing with the line ""High cholesterol kills more people than smoking, shouldn't we have that label on cheese"" would, if presented as argument in a real senate committee, draw raised eyebrows and the simple counter ""cheese isn't directly related to the deaths of its customer base and, if you check the facts, smoking is a large factor in cases of high cholesterol"". But in the film, which has been written, we take for granted that A.E. is a wunderkind Svengali snake-oil salesman who can convince ANYONE of ANYTHING, despite the fact that he only debates people whose couldn't form a counter-argument to genocide. It's like trying to sell me on someone being the greatest boxer in the world, but they only fight old women and four year-olds. Don't just tell me the guy's the world's greatest arguer - show me. Have him convince me of something other than the laziness of the screenwriter.4) If Katie Holmes was set on fire she couldn't convincinly play a person on fire.",2,"Sadly, I hated this

1008697,A1DAOL3NMHEPLS,B000H0MKO2,David F. Nolan,"[2, 3]","""Thank You for Smoking"" is a mixed bag, mixing sharp observations about the American Political System with occasional droll humor... but it fails to realize its full potential for a couple of reasons.First and foremost, it is ambivalent as to whether the lead character, Nick Naylor, is a hero or a villain.  Personally, I liked a lot of what he had to say about freedom of choice, but the way it was presented, it seemed that the movie was mocking those sentiments. Of course, the liberal do-gooders also get their fair share of mocking, but ultimately the movie lacks a point of view.Second, I found it odd that although a crucial plot development centers on the fact that Nick would have to be a fairly heavy smoker to survive one particular event, he is never shown actually smoking. In fact, hardly anybody smokes throughout the entire movie, including all the tobacco industry people.Also, although I have no problem with profanity or ""bad language"" when it serves a real purpose, I thought they used the ""f"" word far too often in this movie, when it didn't serve a purpose.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but not as much as I thought I would. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that were an option; I'm going with 3 to bring the average down from its current 4-star level.  (I thought the funniest moment was in one of the deleted scenes, where the tobacco guys are considering various versions of a skull-and-crossbones logo.

1008698,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000H0MKO2,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 1]","One of the many ironies in this blatant satire (which is NOT a documentary) is that at no time is anybody seen smoking!  No Hollywood cinematic light ups.  Even Nick Naylor, who is vice president of the smoking PR conglomerate, does not actually light up on screen.  We see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one, that's it.The joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way.  Now you might think that, well, a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does, certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see.  However, if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away, the message would surely be mixed.No mixed messages here.  Aaron Eckhart who stars as Nick Naylor is a sort of charming sociopath.  He describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed.  In an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have Katie Holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the ""Washington Probe"" newspaper who gets him into bed, all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks.  He was owned, so to speak, and taken advantage of sexually.Eckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways.  You may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film In the Company of Men (1997), which I highly recommend.  (See my review.)  Here he is a little sweeter, a little more charming, and amazingly enough a good role model for his son Joey (Cameron Bright), who, by the way, has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well.  How this is pulled off is something to behold, for sure.  But basically the rationale is that Nick is doing it all ""to pay the mortgage"" (""the yuppie Nuremberg defense"") and that is the lesson that Joey learns, and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows up.Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy) holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while Nick tells him that the Vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks; Nick hanging out with a RP person representing the interests of alcohol (Maria Bello), and another (David Koechner) whoring for the gun industry.  They like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killed.Robert Duvall has a modest part as the ""Captain"" of tobacco and Rob Lowe gets to play Jeff Megall, a big time, Machiavellian Hollywood money man, who is lining up Catherine Zeta-Jones and I forget who, to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenes--for a price to be paid for by Big Tobacco.  The joke here is that this practice has long been a source of Hollywood film production up-front revenue.  There's a scene showing old Hollywood stars with PC touch ups of their movies, showing them with lolly-pops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettes.The script (adapted from a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of conservative pundit William F. Buckley) and direction by Jason Reitman deserve some kind of award for originality.  The film is definitely a put down of industry PR people, yet somehow it makes them look human.",4,Clever satire,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3421,"['One', 'many', 'ironies', 'blatant', 'satire', 'NOT', 'documentary', 'time', 'anybody', 'seen', 'smoking', 'Hollywood', 'cinematic', 'light', 'ups', 'Even', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'who', 'vice', 'president', 'smoking', 'PR', 'conglomerate', 'not', 'actually', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'see', 'once', 'look', 'empty', 'pack', 'cigarettes', 'wishing', 'had', 'one', 'it.The', 'joke', 'square', 'movie', 'smoking', 'nobody', 'associated', 'movie', 'be', 'accused', 'supporting', 'smoking', 'way', 'Now', 'might', 'think', 'well', 'movie', 'smoking', 'bad', 'light', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'tobacco', 'companies', 'want', 'see', 'However', 'movie', 'producers', 'also', 'threw', 'few', 'scenes', 'stars', 'puffing', 'happily', 'away', 'message', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'mixed.No', 'mixed', 'messages', 'here', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'sort', 'charming', 'sociopath', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'woman', 'bed', 'relentlessly', 'ironic', 'follow', 'up', 'have', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'playing', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'Washington', 'Probe', 'newspaper', 'who', 'bed', 'better', 'get', 'reveal', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'was', 'owned', 'so', 'speak', 'taken', 'advantage', 'sexually.Eckhart', 'perfect', 'part', 'handsome', 'winning', 'ways', 'may', 'recall', 'played', 'corporate', 'sexist', 'pig', 'sociopath', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'Company', 'Men', '1997', 'highly', 'recommend', 'See', 'review', 'Here', 'little', 'sweeter', 'little', 'more', 'charming', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'son', 'Joey', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'who', 'way', 'lot', 'sharp', 'lines', 'delivers', 'well', 'How', 'pulled', 'off', 'something', 'behold', 'sure', 'basically', 'rationale', 'Nick', 'doing', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'yuppie', 'Nuremberg', 'defense', 'lesson', 'Joey', 'presumably', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'adapt', 'more', 'socially', 'correct', 'employment', 'when', 'up.Some', 'satirical', 'bits', 'include', 'Marlboro', 'Man', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'cancer', 'getting', 'bribe', 'senator', 'Vermont', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'holding', 'senate', 'hearing', 'getting', 'skull', 'crossbones', 'logo', 'put', 'cigarette', 'packages', 'Nick', 'Vermont', 'cows', 'cheese', 'are', 'causing', 'clogged', 'arteries', 'heart', 'attacks', 'Nick', 'hanging', 'out', 'RP', 'person', 'representing', 'interests', 'alcohol', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'David', 'Koechner', 'whoring', 'gun', 'industry', 'like', 'sit', 'around', 'dinner', 'compare', 'number', 'people', 'products', 'have', 'killed.Robert', 'Duvall', 'modest', 'part', 'Captain', 'tobacco', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'play', 'Jeff', 'Megall', 'big', 'time', 'Machiavellian', 'Hollywood', 'money', 'man', 'who', 'lining', 'up', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'forget', 'who', 'play', 'naked', 'space', 'movie', 'serious', 'smoking', 'scenes', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'joke', 'here', 'practice', 'long', 'been', 'source', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'production', 'up-front', 'revenue', 'scene', 'showing', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'PC', 'touch', 'ups', 'movies', 'showing', 'lolly-pops', 'pencils', 'hanging', 'mouths', 'instead', 'cigarettes.The', 'script', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Christopher', 'Buckley', 'son', 'conservative', 'pundit', 'William', 'F.', 'Buckley', 'direction', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'deserve', 'kind', 'award', 'originality', 'film', 'definitely', 'put', 'down', 'industry', 'PR', 'people', 'yet', 'somehow', 'look', 'human']",N/A

Though they share the same title and some of the same plot points, the novel and movie are completely different. In order to make the movie stay within in an hour and a half, the director/screenwriter took out a main character who was crucial to the novel. In doing so, the film has a completely different feel than the movie. The moral of the book is to basically watch one's back because a friend or co-worker could be your greatest enemy. However, the moral of the movie is that you should never tell anything to a reporter even if you are sleeping with her and she seems sweet. In other words, the enemy is from the outside. Due to this, the ending of the novel and that of the film are almost exact opposite of each other. While the film eliminated a pivotal co-worker character, it added Nick's son. Though the scenes between father and son were humorous, I don't believe that it added anything to the movie. In contrast, the book only mentions Nick's son once or twice which further shows Nick's alienation from his family and any kind of love. Lastly, the novel puts a great emphasis on Nick's relationship with the owner of the Academy of Tobacco Studies (known as the Captain).

Since then, he has been waffling in leading man roles, but luckily, he comes back to form as the appropriately named Nick Naylor, tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire, in first-time director/writer Jason Reitman's wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills. The film's perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters morally ambiguous, but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors. The zigzag plot follows Nick from the bogus, cigarette company-funded Academy of Tobacco Studies to the pretentiously Zen office of an equally pretentious Hollywood Studio mogul to a dicey encounter with a former Marlboro man to the welcoming arms of an ambitious reporter. The unpredictable journey provides Reitman an opportunity for both broad, whack-a-mole comedy to piercing, observant zingers that resonate with the truths they expose.Reitman has recruited a first-class cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by Eckhart, who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable. At their favorite watering hole, Nick's two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by David Koechner as the Bush-sound-alike firearms specialist and especially the wondrous Maria Bello as the sharp-tongued alcohol representative. There are also inspired turns from very unlikely sources with Rob Lowe hilarious as Jeff Megall, the honey-voiced, Asia-obsessed mogul; Sam Elliott defiantly cagey as the Marlboro Man; and even Katie Holmes surprisingly convincing as Heather Holloway, the morally bankrupt reporter who appears to be Nick's kindred spirit. Scene stealing is quite democratic with clever turns by Robert Duvall as the tobacco kingpin; William H. Macy as the unctuous, anti-tobacco senator from Vermont looking to put a skull-and-crossbones logo on all packs of cigarettes; J.K. Simmons as Nick's immoral boss BR; and a very funny Adam Brody as Megall's obnoxious assistant.Beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits, the plot goes in unexpected directions, and while the ending is a bit soft, the overall movie more than satisfies. In fact, I doubt if I have laughed harder in a movie theater since last year's ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", but the smart, provocative barbs really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful to the audience. Even the comparatively soft-centered scenes of Nick with his son have a nice edge, and with his translucent blue eyes, Cameron Bright strikes the right, non-judgmental notes as Joey. Reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most Capra-esque situation.

Hollywood makes movies good, not good movies. And this film is a prime example of that maxim: good set-up, good actors, good directing, good camera work...bad movie.Now, before you get all hot and bothered about the fact that I didn't like a movie that you thought was funny and cute, stop and think for a minute. What makes a movie good? Is it the special effects? The visuals? The cute female (male) lead? The fact that you laughed? Well, no, actually. (Although all those things help.) What makes a movie good is the IDEA behind it. And this movie was based on a very bad one.If you watch the special features, you'll hear a lot of people say that this movie is about ""spin."" That's pure spin. The movie (if you pay close attention to what the director says) is about ""political correctness."" In this case, since you are rooting for the ""bad guy"" (an amoral liar and all round despicable person), and boo-ing the ""good guy"" (the be-sandaled Senator from Vermont), the ""correctness"" part can be argued. Is it merely politically correct to try and curtail smoking? Is it on a par with saying ""physically challenged"" or ""differently abled"" rather than disabled or crippled? No, it is not. It is a hard, proven fact that cigarettes do indeed kill, that the tobacco lobby doesn't give a rodent's derriere about that, and that any laws passed through the efforts of lobbyists (like the protagonist of this film) will cause you direct and personal harm.The other reason this film is bad is that it simply didn't work as a film. You can't make a feel-good movie about a man who is immoral. The teary-eyed Child who loves and supports Dad doesn't make you feel all warm and fuzzy. Instead you feel like slapping him, as much for the sentiment as for the stilted, all too adult-sounding, and blatantly expository lines he is forced to deliver. There is no godly reason for us to feel good about the son, or about the ex-spouse for that matter, who somehow, inexplicably decides to support her ex-hubby in the end. No, a plot like that only works if the main character comes through with a change of heart. And this one didn't.Two thumbs down on this one.

What I got was that and much more.This film touches on the continuing role that sophistry plays in our society.  A bane to society since the days of Socrates, practicioners of this ancient art can ""win"" any argument, by changing the subject, appealing to emotion, using buzz words, or by employing countless other tricks.The goal isn't to find truth, the goal is to persuade the sheep-like masses, who all too often ""go with their gut"" instead of analyzing statements rationally.  The central character, Nick Naylor, is a master of this art. As a spokesperson for the tobacco industry, he fields questions about smoking's harmful effects on countless TV shows and in other forums.Rather than address the issue, he reframes the debate into a discussion about freedom  of choice, attacks the motives of his accusers, and responds to questions with queries of his own.  In short, he is a slippery weasel par excellance.The film follows him going about his job with his adolescent son in tow.He teaches the boy the fine points of sophistry while dispensing hush money and conspiring with Hollywood to make smoking look sexy.One thing I loved about the movie is that there are no clear good guy/bad guy roles.  Everyone's motives are suspect, even the crusading anti-smoking senator who refuses to admit that his state's cheese products are laden with cholesterol and thus a primary factor in heart disease.This is why I titled my review as I did.

Based on the very edgy novel by Christopher Buckley, director Jason Reitman has adapted the story for the screen, populated his diatribe with a fine cast of actors, and directs the whole concept with deft precision. While many not familiar with the book's bite will be put off by the title, rest assured that no one escapes this exploration of the tobacco industry, the health industry, and the political industry unscathed.Aaron Eckhart is spot on as the tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, a man of style and spin who can talk his way through any confrontational encounter and come out the winner.  He is supported by the tobacco kings  Budd 'BR' Rohrbacher (J.K. Simmons) and 'The Captain' (Robert Duvall), the movie mogul Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), by his buddies in crime Maria Bello and David Koechner with similar lobbyist roles in alcohol and firearms, and confronted by Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy in another jewel of a role), ex-Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), and journalist Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). How he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story, a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the anti-smoking brigade.The lines are fast and furious and Eckhart is superb in his role. Somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between Eckhart and his son (Cameron Bright - as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today)  make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum, but that is Hollywood covering its tracks.

This film will only be an eye opener to someone who has been in a coma for the last few decades. The ending, where the lead character feels some moral responsibility toward his son is phony. The movie spends most of its running time showing us how utterly amoral the character is. Are we really supposed to believe that he suddenly feels remorse because of his son? More likely (and I know this type), he would keep his son in the dark about the true nature of his work. Katie Holmes looks horrible here.

1008715,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000H0MKO2,Isaac,"[2, 5]","""I front an organization that kills 1,200 people a day,"" says Nick Taylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist for the tobacco industry. His job is to stand up for tobacco companies that are being attacked by knuckleheads who accuse the businesses of being murdering bastards. Talyor loves what he does, and he's very good at it. He is able to attack his opponents from every angle imaginable. But as clever as he is, he never observes the fact that smoking is essentially long term suicide, and that some people who do smoke are too dumb to make an attempt to quit.As a conservative Republican, I think that the attack on the tobacco industry is just as ridiculous as the attacks on gun manufacturers and McDonald's. Some may remember the outrageous lawsuit a number of years ago in which a woman spilled hot McDonald's coffee all over herself, sued the establishment, and won. But it get's better. Now obese people are taking McDonald's to court. Obese people aren't obese because of McDonald's. They are obese because they choose not to burn away the calories or because of their inescapable genetic makeup. In ""Super Size Me,"" the great 2004 documentary by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, we were educated on the theory that there is a point where corporate responsibility ends and personal responsibility begins. Corporate responsibility ends at the cash register, and personal responsiblity begins when you digest the food.The same aspect applies to the gun industry, and in 2003, the endlessly fascinating ""Runaway Jury,"" which was based on a novel by John Grisham, explored lawsuits against the gun industry. Although I disagreed with the outcome, I still gave the film four stars, but the bottom line is simple: companies aren't responsible for what their products do to people, especially by other people. A hopeless dote who blows his co-workers away can't be controled by the gun company that he purchased the firearm from. In the same way, a smoker should not be allowed to sue a tobacco company for hospital treatment for lung cancer. Any judge with a brain would dismiss the case immediately, give the plaintiff a middle finger, and wish him luck on his journey up the creek without a canoe or a paddle.""Runaway Jury"" and ""Super Size Me"" were answers to the ridiculous arguments against corporations. ""Thank You For Smoking"" is more of a hokey outcry rather than an answer. When Nick Taylor stands up for what he believes in, he is more than certain that he is right. He is just as determined as Uri Orlov from last year's excellent ""Lord of War,"" who sold illegal arms to every army but the Salvation Army. Taylor is an orator, no more, no less. He is payed to talk, and tobacco companies world wide consider him a go-to man in their time of need.""Thank You For Smoking"" draws the curtain on American stupidity, revealing both sides of an argument that will never reach compromise. Taylor's job requires sometimes very dangerous work. He crosses paths with a number of characters in the media and political underworld, much like an assassin would in a gangster film. He is good friends with two very interesting people: Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), an alcoholic who is a lobyist for the alcohol industry, and Jay Bliss (David Koechner), a firearms industry spokesperson. Together, they call themselves The MOD (Merchants Of Death) Squad, meeting in a quiet restaurant for sandwiches and drinks on a regular basis, and discussing marketing their little club with t-shirts and bumper stickers.Nick has a son named Joey, played by Cameron Bright, who we saw three weeks ago capping his father and being kidnapped by murderous pedophiles in ""Running Scared."" Here he is being homeschooled by his father, not just in academics, but in the tricks of his father's trade. Nick's boss is BR (J. K. Simmons), an aggressive hot-head who is determined to boost cigarette sales. Nick suggests the movies, in one of the film's most memorable sequences, so that tobacco can begin to appeal to all ages. He also suggests that all of the characters smoke, because, as he so cleverly observes, ""these days when anybody smokes in the movies, they are either Europeans or psychopaths.""But wait, there's more. Nick even encounters Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), a sexy journalist doing an investigaton for The Washington Probe. There is Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a corporate mongul who works as a vessel for Nick's ideas. There is Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), a former Marlboro Man who is dying of lung cancer and ready to speak out against the tobacco industry. There is also the Captain (Robert Duvall), a tobacco tycoon based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who sees Nick as a revolutionary for Amercian society. And then there is the matter of Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who is quick to attack the tobacco industry from multiple directions but slow to realize that his homestate of Vermont, which produces cheddar cheese, is, in the context of his own arguement, a contributer to cholesterol, the leading cause of death in the United States, something that Nick is educated enough to point out by himself.""Thank You For Smoking"" would be the result if Quentin Tarantino were to attempt a social and politcal satire. Since Nick is such an intelligent professional, and because he is able to knock down his enemies one at a time, subtly pinpointing the stupidity of their own argument, the film is wide open for humorous, quotable dialogue that only continues to resonate once it penetrates your eardrums. On the part of writer/director Jason Reitman, no praise is too high. Like Paul Haggis did in devising ""Crash,"" Reitman is able to juggle a number of very diverse characters and bring them to life with spirited animation. This is also one of the first satires I've seen in a while in which the humor is never of the goofy slapstick caliber, and seems to emerge so naturally from the material that you almost miss it once it emerges.What makes the film so effective is that Nick is an obnoxious jerk that you can't help but adore. He is played with quiet enthusiasm by Aaron Eckhart, an actor who goes shamefully unmentioned when movie snobs gather together to discuss their obsession. He is so effective, with his smirk grin, uplifting voice, and sprawling confidence, that you actually accept him as a lobbyist. Nick belongs there. He has the look and behind-the-scenes personality as a confident professional who takes pleasure in doing his job. Even in handling the character of Nick, the film never goes into the conventional atmosphere of the genre. Unlike in ""Lord of War,"" the hero never goes through a period in the third act in which he pays dearly for his sins. Nick makes out like a bandit.Jason Reitman has directed a number of short films, but with his first full length project, he has struck gold and set up a mine. The only way to prevent myself from digging into the deeper layers of the film is to end my review. Checking out his resume on imdb.com would lead you to believe that he would never find a niche for himself in the world of filmmaking. Well, he has.",5,Thank You For Smoking,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,7085,"['front', 'organization', '1,200', 'people', 'day', 'Nick', 'Taylor', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'lobbyist', 'tobacco', 'industry',

There were a few misplays. The kidnapping was just strange and I am not sure how that explained anything.There is another review talking about smoking in the movie. I disagree. After the first few minutes, I noticed there was no smoking. I started to play close attention. There was very little or no smoking in the movie. Ebert comments on the same observation in his review. Again, the movie is poking fun at lobbyists. Everyone knows smoking is bad for you. What's the point of spoofing the tobacco industry?My favorite part in the movie was the debate about the MOD (ministers of death) squad about who caused more deaths: smoking, drinking or guns. Another good point is the father/son relationship. The son knows his father is hated by everybody, but his father is very good at what he does, which is talking. The father doesn't apologize for what he does, except, maybe at the very end.

1008718,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000H0MKO2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","""Thank You for Smoking"" was an entertaining movie. I enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of Hollywood types. The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing you know. Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in ""The Gift"". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like ""I want to f*** you, when I watch you on TV"" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye.Even though this is Jason Reitman's first feature film he is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that ""Smoking"" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.I like the message behind ""Thank You For Smoking"" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking.

Not hard to see why. This movie is probably one of the best American comedies of the year; Satire doesn't come around as often in film as it used to and when it does, it's usually not done very well. ""Thank You for Smoking"" does it perfectly. Aaron Eckart ('Suspect Zero') plays Nick Naylor, the Vice President of The Center of Tobacco Studies. Nick's job is to talk to people and convince them that smoking is not as bad as it seems. He even gets together with friends (Maria Bello & David Koechner), who work to make light of simalar products, to see who's product causes the largest death toll. This group, I might add, is called The M.O.D. Squad (short for ""Merchants of Death""). Nick's job interferes with his personal life. He's divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens, 'Truth or Consequences, N.M.') and only sees his son (Cameron Bright, 'Birth') on weekends; A sexy reporter (Katie Holmes) is using him to score a big story; And he even ends up getting kidnapped at one point. The movie's all-star cast also features Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons (who plays Nick's boss BR), Adam Brody, Rob Lowe, and Dennis Miller. The movie's got some great one-liners, countless great scenes, and some in-your-face politically incorrect humor (when BR talks about an environmentalist, the word ""Pussy"" flashes at the bottom of the screen). The opening scene is truly hilarious. One of the most critical elements of this film however is the performances. The things the main character represents are despicable, so you need to like the character. Having said that, Eckhart is brilliant. He plays the character so convincingly, you half-believe a lot of the stuff he says. The critics were not lying about this film.

Make up your own mind based on that.

So, it was a surprise for me, both in genre and the story.Nick Naylor is a spinner of a spokesperson for the tobacco industry.  He's so savvy with words that he could convince anyone that smoking is actually good for you.  Even if he doesn't necessarily believe it himself.Nick has everything going smoothly for him.  He meets once a week with 2 other lobbyists (guns and alcohol).  They call themselves ""the MOD"" (Merchants of Death).  He isn't afraid of his boss because he knows that THE man of tobacco (Duvall) has his back.  He's off to Hollywood to get cigarette smoking back on screen.The governor of Vermont (Macy) wants a televised political debate with him.  However, he needs leverage.  Unknown to the governor, a reporter (Holmes) wants to do an article on Naylor.  Drawn to her charm, wits and sexiness, he spills the beans to her.  Well...as long as he is getting a ""side dish"".  Of course, the reporter has an ulterior motive, which is to expose Naylor as who he really is.Predictably, things spiral down as soon as the article is released which contains secrets and identities of those behind the tobacco industry.  The governor just cannot wait to debate with Naylor as well as making him look like a fool.Can Naylor turn things around and save face as well as the tobacco industry?  Has the provobial cat gotten his tongue?I like *Thank You for Smoking* because it was stimulating for discussion with friends after the movie.

The lines are funny; the acting is convincing and the movie manages to make a great point about ""spin"" (aka bulls***) in today's world.The action begins with tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) appearing on a talk show to put a spin on the fact the smoking causes cancer. Nick, smirking all the way, says that the tobacco companies want a boy with cancer to live so they could keep another customer. Nick argues further that health officials would love to see the young ""cancer boy"" die so their budgets would be fatter. This is just the tip of the iceberg, folks; Nick goes through his whole life putting a spin on tobacco to make it seem safe, romantic and glorious.Nick's partners in crime include two people he meets for lunch from time to time; and they call themselves ""The Mod Squad."" Look for great performances by Maria Bello as Polly Bailey and David Koechner as Bobby Jay Bliss who work for the alcohol and gun lobbies respectively. Nick's slave driving boss, B.R. (J.K. Simmons) puts in a great performance and the head honcho of the tobacco group, simply referred to as ""Captain,"" is played wonderfully by Robert Duvall.Nick's personal life isn't peachy--he's separated from his wife. When a seductive female reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) gets the real scoop on Nick's secrets and lets it all out in a tell-all article in a prominent Washington, D.C. newspaper, Nick's world comes crashing down around him.Will Nick be able to bounce back from the negative publicity he gets? Will he keep his friends and his job? What will his young, impressionable son Joey (Cameron Bright) think of him when the whole truth comes out?

We get an interview with Aaron Eckhart and others on The Charlie Rose Show; there are quite a few deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; there's a brief ""making of"" featurette; a director and cast commentary; storyboard and more! I am very impressed.Overall, I would highly recommend Thank You For Smoking for people who enjoy indie movies that are really funny and try to playfully make a point at the same time. You'll notice that no one in the film is ever filmed smoking a cigarette! However, this is not a family movie; there is a fair amount of swearing and there are some violent scenes that could upset small children.

If you merely want to watch a feel-good film, I strongly urge you to avoid this dvd. On the other hand, if you are eager to think a little bit more, and don't mind a sometimes acerbic sense of humour, this is the right movie for you.The main character is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist and spokesman for the American tobacco industry that is a master of media spinning and doublespeak, and that is glad of having ""a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people"". Nick has a son, Joey, and thus has to try to be a role model to him, despite his polemic job. That is specially difficult after a beautiful reporter (Katie Holmes) with whom he had an affair betrays his trust, writing a tell-all article about him.It is pretty interesting to watch Nick as he twists logic in order to defend the right of everybody to smoke, saying that has to do with freedom of choice. In his words, ""that's the beauty of arguing, because if you argue correctly you are never wrong"". This film has fictional characters, but is also based on some real facts, something that makes it specially interesting.

There are few political satires that come out of La-La Land, and even fewer--""Dr. Strangelove"" comes to mind--that are commercially successful. This is why Jason Reitman's ""Thank You for Smoking,"" based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, is so welcome. Particularly in today's poisonous political atmosphere, it is wonderful and refreshing to see a movie that is so clever, so witty, and so worldly-wise about America's true national sport--spin-doctoring--and how all sides play it to their advantage. Aaron Eckhart is wonderfully sleazy as Nick Naylor, a hired gun for the tobacco industry who delights in unleashing his brilliant verbiage in the service of making anti-smoking advocates look like the Gestapo. Only occasionally--such as when he's with his young son (Cameron Bright)--does Nick feel any twinges of conscience about using his talents in order to persuade people to suck poison down their lungs. But then again, Nick is positively cuddly compared with some of his adversaries, such as backstabbing reporter Heather Hathaway (Katie Holmes) and self-righteous Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), whose crunchy-granola politics mask the heart of a ruthless political hatchetman. ""Thank You for Smoking"" is stuffed with excellent comic performances, including Maria Bello and David Koechner as Nick's fellow spin doctors in the alcohol and firearms industries; J.K. Simmons as Nick's treacherous, blowhard boss; Rob Lowe and Adam Brody as a couple of flaky, motormouthed Hollywood egomaniacs; and especially the great Robert Duvall as ""The Colonel,"" a courtly throwback to the time when Big Tobacco was King.

1008752,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000H0MKO2,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","For his first feature-length film, Jason Reitman has adapted Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel ""Thank You for Smoking"", a satire of Capitol Hill lobbyists, Senators, and, most of all, political correctness. The hero, or anti-hero, of our story is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), hustler extraordinaire and lobbyist for the tobacco industry. His job is spin control, and Nick delights in the hatred that his powers of persuasion inspires. Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy), a Birkenstock-wearing liberal from Vermont, wants to require that a skull and crossbones be displayed on cigarette packages. Nick's hard-nosed boss ""BR"" (J.K. Simmons) is panicked at the state of cigarette sales. It's up to Nick to save the day by promoting onscreen smoking in Hollywood and taking on Finistirre in Congress. But a certain pretty reporter (Katie Holmes) is out to dish the dirt on the tobacco lobby.There is some very funny stuff in ""Thank You for Smoking"", and Aaron Eckhart is perfect for the part of this fast-talking, energetic, unscrupulous charmer. The self-described Merchants of Death, or ""MOD Squad"", the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms lobbyists who meet for lunch to brag about their deceptions and compare death tolls, are hilarious. I could easily watch alcohol's Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), the gun lobby's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), and tobacco's Nick Naylor gab for half an hour. That would be a side-splitting short film in itself. My hat is off to that trio of actors. J.K. Simmons' barking ""BR"" is equally comical. Where the film arguably fails is in being too sentimental. Jason Reitman has given Nick a young son, Joey (Cameron Bright), who is not in the book. Joey humanizes Nick by looking up to his father. Reitman's reasons for creating the boy are obvious, but I wonder if it was wise to soften Nick's character. A relentless Nick would have been better.""Thank You For Smoking"" skewers political correctness and spin doctors in line with the novel's intentions. It doesn't condone or discourage smoking. It pokes fun at the people who manufacture spin and the people who eat it up. I can only speculate, but I assume that Christopher Buckley chose the tobacco lobby because it is absurd and essentially innocuous. The tobacco lobby has gone to extraordinary lengths to tell people a bunch of lies that no one ever believed. This is a lifestyle lobby. It's perfect fodder for satire, as are self-righteous anti-tobacco crusaders. ""Thank You for Smoking"" excels in characterizations but doesn't have the guts to be uncompromising satire. Still, it's enjoyable if you're looking for politically incorrect comedy.  Ironically, no one smokes in this film.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features include 13 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; a Charlie Rose Show (18 min) with Jason Reitman, Christopher Buckley, Aaron Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; 2 featurettes; a Poster Art Gallery (7 posters); an Art Department Gallery with logos and artwork from the film; a Storyboard Gallery of 112 storyboards from quite a few scenes; a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min); and a Soundtrack Spot (30 sec). ""Unfiltered Comedy: The Making of Thank You For Smoking"" (9 min) features interviews with cast and Jason Reitman, who talk about characters and the film's think-for-yourself themes. ""America: Living In Spin"" (5 min) is examples of ""spin"" from the movie and real media with commentary. I recommend the Charlie Rose feature and the Making Of feature. There are 2 audio commentaries: The first is by director Jason Reitman. The second is by Reitman and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. Most of what Reitman says in the 2nd commentary repeats what he said in the 1st. So, if you're going to listen to one commentary, listen to the 2nd one.

It's definitely one of the best adult comedies of 2006, joining the ranks of Scoop and Little Miss Sunshine.It's one of the best satires I've seen.  It's done really well, with a great story, and it's relatively brave in staring Tobacco Companies straight in the face.The story, as satirical as it is, also tends to be endearing at times when the focus is on the father-son relationship.The casting is perfect...after all, as the saying goes, Aaron Eckhart was born to play Nick Naylor. The supporting cast is just as perfect.  I completely bought each and every one of their performances, from Maria Bello to J.K. Simmons, and the legend Robert Duvall.  I'm still split on Katie Holmes though.  She's not bad, she's just very ""Katie Holmes-ish"", whatever that turns out to be.The performance I enjoyed the most though had to be from William H. Macy.  I'm not a fan of his at all, but he was just perfect as the Vermont Senator campaigning against the tobacco industry.  His performance was PRICELESS!  I got the biggest laughs out of him, from him in his office to him at the Senate Hearing at the end.If for anything, this movie is worth watching just for those last 10 minutes and William H. Macy's performance during the Senate Hearing.  That will forever remain one of my favorite scenes of all time.This is a movie I'd definitely recommend.

I know what you're thinking.  I didn't like the movie.  Right?  Wrong! Thank You For Smoking is a good movie.  It's thought-provoking and clever and feindishly un-PC and I like that.

Well-written and perfectly casted (Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, and more!) Thank You For Smoking follows along with the exploits of Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aron Eckhart) who's greatest asset is his ability to BS and argue.  While pushing a product like cigarettes onto the citizens of the world Naylor still manages to keep himself grounded,trying to teach life lessons to his 12 year old son.  Are cigarettes poison?  Not enough evidence to suggest that, as Naylor would say.  It's big business vs. anyone with so-called morales.  Poignant without being pushy, Thank You For Smoking makes you think while you laugh.  There are alot of subjects touched upon here that will make certain people squirm or look away, and that I think is why I enjoyed it so much.  Was it drop dead funny?

This comedy is one of these movies.  The movie revolves around the life and career of Nick Naylor, PR person for Big Tobacco, and begins with him taking on and taking out his political opponents live on a national talk show.  We then come to see him comment and explain his work to his son, his son's classmates, his counterparts in the alcohol and firearms industries, his boss, and unfortunately for him, an investigative reporter with a knack for twisting words every bit as much as him.  Put together, we see the tobacco industry and the PR industry stood on its head and examined from the top down.Though smooth, ironies abound in the life of Nick.  First, his ex-wife is now married to a doctor who hates smoking.  Second, his opponents in the health care industry and Congress actually make him invaluable to Big Tobacco by their efforts to limit smoking.  Third, he uses the most roundabout reverse psychology possible to bribe an ex-smoker into keeping mum about the hazards of tobacco use.  Watching the movie from beginning to end, and seeing how the foes and friends of tobacco act, we get an interesting, and funny, examination of American society.  All in all, a great movie.

1008760,A6JQ6I9LGKXBG,B000H0MKO2,Paul Wiseman,"[1, 1]","Can a movie be morally reprehensible and wickedly wonderful at the same time? Apparently, yes. ""Thank You For Smoking'' is hilarious fun. Aaron Eckhart, his star power running full blast, is perfect as tobacco industry lobbyist Nick Naylor. (""You know the guy who can pick up any girl? I'm him. On crack.'') And he gets great support from gun lobbyist David Koechner and alcohol lobbyist Maria Bello - as fellow members of the MOD (Merchants of Death) Squad; from the underrated Rob Lowe as a weird Hollywood power broker; and from J.K. Simmons as Eckhart's bug-eyed boss. But something started bothering me about this movie. I probably wouldn't have thought much of it if I hadn't watched a special features interview with director Jason Reitman. Reitman clearly views the anti-smoking movement with contempt. He seems to think that Eckhart's character - who makes big bucks deliberately misleading the public about a product that kills nearly half a million people every year - is no worse and perhaps more admirable than sanctimonious blowhards who want to tell others what to do. The message of the movie seems to be: Don't let anyone tell you what to believe or what to do. Decide for yourself. But is it really so simple when an industry uses bogus research and cutting-edge media manipulation to get people to use a deadly, addictive product? Shouldn't a responsible government do something to counter industry propaganda - even if it doesn't impose the ridiculous skull-and-crossbones label that senator William H. Macy wants to see on every pack of cigarettes? Reitman seems to believe that nothing really matters. You should use whatever skills you have to make as much money as you can and to take care of your family. As Margaret Thatcher put it: ""Who is society? There is no such thing. There are individual men and women and there are families.''

I'm sure you've heard that it's a satire of the tobacco industry, in which a ""spokesperson"" for big tobacco (played by Aaron Eckhart) twists the words of others, scoffs at science and shows not a whiff of conscience.  He appears on talk shows and wins over skeptical audiences.  He's constantly spinning the truth, always grabbing at a chance to defend cigarettes and smokers.  He's very good at his job...mostly because he's VERY likeable.The fun thing about the film is that Eckhart makes his character sympathetic.  His nerve is flabbergasting and admirable (while he spouts the most ridiculous things, he oozes sincerity.  We know he doesn't believe his spiel, but he sure sells it).  He has a great relationship with his teenage son.  He's whip-smart.  He's funny, but not unbelievably so.The movie is a satire of many things.  Some of the best jabs are taken at the expense of ""big"" Hollywood, personified by Rob Lowe as a movie-mogul in a kimono, who helps Eckhart seal a deal on some product-placement in a big-budget sci-fi movie.  Lowe is priceless...just seeing him brings on laughs.  It also satirizes ""Birkenstock-wearing"" liberal politicians (embodied in William Macy).  There are jabs at the alcohol and gun industries.  It's really more about now brazenly industries, politicians, Hollywood, individuals (you name it) will spin lies into truth to help their causes.If you like satires, this will be a treat...whether you smoke or not.  And the movie has moments of real power (the scenes when Eckhart approaches a dying Marlboro Man [wonderful Sam Elliott] with what amounts to a bribe is chilling), plus moments of warmth...such as the scenes between Eckhart and his son, who is trying to get a handle on what dad does for a living.Everyone is great.  J.K. Simmons (a real favorite of mine) doing a spin on his character from Spiderman...just better.  Robert Duvall in a small but fun role.  Katie Holmes.  Maria Bello.  William Macy.  Cameron Bright. Sam Ellliott.  And especially Eckhart, who has found a perfect role.  While he was brilliant in IN THE COMPANY OF MEN...he was also VERY easy to despise.  Here, while his character's actions are quite despicable...he is charming, handsome, smart, well-dressed and vulnerable.  I hope people see the film and start appreciating this guy more.It wasn't a often a laugh-out-loud film.  It's humor evokes smiles, chuckles and knowing ""ah-ha's.""  There's no slapstick.

1008768,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000H0MKO2,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[1, 3]","Based on a best-selling 'insider' novel of the same name, this film examines how the multi-million dollar tobacco industry promises one thing to the public and then privately does another.People who would be 'crying foul' with almost any other industry are actually convinced the tobacco industry is on their side. It is an unspoken truth that Big Tobacco's 'anti-smoking' initiatives are actually enticing kids to try--and become hooked on their products. Constantly producing a new generation of consumers (especially important when you are producing a product whose only result is to kill people!) is very important for this industry.Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, Vice President of and the chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, a tobacco lobby funded by cigarette companies to ""research"" the links between smoking cigarettes and health. Naturally because this is an in-industry organization, no links are ever made--and his other job requires him to defend 'smokers rights'.After a 'skull and crossbones' bill is proposed, Nick suggests that Hollywood do their part to publicize smoking again, people seeing their favorite stars light up will think it is 'cool'. The dichotomy between this, his membership in the self-referenced Merchants Of Death (M.O.D. Squad) and then attempts to build a loving relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright) are wide. He is not a moral man, but Naylor is not subhuman scum either.Other powerful performances are delivered by Katie Holmes. She plays investigative reporter Heather Holloway, skeptical of M.O.D. Squad. An article she writes ultimately allows Nick to really light up his son's life.Everybody needs to see this film at least once if they want to understand the full power of marketing upon the human psyche and the political power of effective advertising.

1008769,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000H0MKO2,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","Jason Reitman`s ""Thank You For Smoking"" would make an interesting companion piece to ""Lord of War,"" since both are sharp, acerbic satires about industries - one tobacco, the other small arms - whose practitioners are often referred to as ""merchants of death.""Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, ""Thank You For Smoking"" centers on Nick Naylor, a smooth-talking lobbyist for Big Tobacco whose job it is to counter all the medical charges leveled against cigarettes so that people will go right on using the product despite the fact that Americans are dropping dead from heart disease, cancer and emphysema at the rate of well over 430,000 people a year.  The triumph of the film is that it resists the temptation to paint everything in broad strokes or to reduce all its figures to the level of simpleminded caricatures.  Naylor may be an amoral cretin in the profession he has chosen to pursue, but as played by the brilliant Aaron Eckhart, he also has a bit of a conscience and the semi-redeeming traits of insecurity, vulnerability and a deep and abiding love for his devoted young son.  Writer/director Jason Reitman ""humanizes"" the characters even as he skewers them mercilessly for how they have chosen to live their lives.  Naylor, for instance, is part of an informal group labeled ""the Mod Squad,"" - short for ""Merchants of Death"" - consisting of Naylor plus two other lobbyists, one from the alcohol industry and one from the gun manufacturers, who meet regularly at a local bar to bemoan their standing as social pariahs and to argue over which of the three industries scores the most deaths per annum.  These characters could easily have been overdrawn and turned into callous villains, but we find ourselves actually liking them - much as we do Naylor - partly because they remain loyal to their buddy when the going gets tough for him and his world threatens to fall to pieces around him.Indeed it is this feeling of ambivalence we have towards Naylor that makes ""Thank You For Smoking"" more than just an anti-smoking jeremiad, for the movie beautifully approximates the seductive power of men like Naylor and makes us aware of how easily we too fall under their spell.  Eckhart is so charismatic, charming and convincing in the role of Naylor that we find ourselves in the unusual position of practically rooting for him to prevail, even though, intellectually, we can pretty much see through the speciousness of his arguments.  The filmmakers are to be commended for not softening the material by turning Naylor into the conventional anti-hero who eventually sees the evils of his ways and does everything in his power to make reparations for the damage and suffering he has caused.  For even though Naylor does have a ""soft,"" likable side to his personality, it isn't always enough to make him do the right thing in every situation or to make all the politically correct speeches the audience believes should be coming from the mouth of a reformed wrongdoer.  The filmmakers make it clear that Naylor ""reforms"" only up to a point, for there is still a great deal of flimflamery lurking in the core of his genes.  Moreover, Buckley and Reitman don't let the anti-smoking forces entirely off the hook either.  The movie often shows them as both extreme (one group even kidnaps and nicotine-poisons Naylor to get him to stop what he's doing) and insufferably self-righteous and petty (one senator wants to digitally erase all the cigarettes from old movies).Eckhart, who has always been a very fine actor despite never having achieved superstar status in Hollywood, should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his dazzling, finely-tuned turn here as a man it is easy to criticize but hard to hate.  He is bolstered by an outstanding cast that includes J.K. Simmons, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Kim Dickens, William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe and Sam Elliott.  Special note should be taken of young Cameron Bright (""X-Men 3""), who brings spirit and depth to the role of Naylor's impressionable but clear-eyed and levelheaded teenage son.""Thank You For Smoking"" is a rarity among American films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time.",4,Lighting up at the movies,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,4238,"['Jason', 'Reitman', 's', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'companion', 'piece', 'Lord', 'War', 'are', 'sharp', 'acerbic', 'satires', 'industries', 'one', 'tobacco', 'other', 'small', 'arms', 'practitioners', 'are', 'often', 'referred', 'merchants', 'death', 'Based', 'novel', 'Christopher', 'Buckley', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'centers', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'smooth-talking', 'lobbyist', 'Big', 'Tobacco', 'job', 'counter', 'medical', 'charges', 'leveled', 'cigarettes', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'right', 'using', 'product', 'fact', 'Americans', 'are', 'dropping', 'dead', 'heart', 'disease', 'cancer', 'emphysema', 'rate', 'well', '430,000', 'people', 'year', 'triumph', 'film', 'temptation', 'paint', 'everything', 'broad', 'strokes', 'reduce', 'figures', 'level', 'simpleminded', 'caricatures', 'Naylor', 'may', 'be', 'amoral', 'cretin', 'profession', 'chosen', 'pursue', 'played', 'brilliant', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'also', 'bit', 'conscience', 'semi-redeeming', 'traits', 'insecurity', 'vulnerability', 'deep', 'abiding', 'love', 'devoted', 'young', 'son', 'Writer/director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'humanizes', 'characters', 'even', 'mercilessly', 'how', 'have', 'chosen', 'live', 'lives', 'Naylor', 'instance', 'part', 'informal', 'group', 'labeled', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'short', 'Merchants', 'Death', 'consisting', 'Naylor', 'two', 'other', 'lobbyists', 'one', 'alcohol', 'industry', 'one', 'gun', 'manufacturers', 'who', 'meet', 'regularly', 'local', 'bar', 'bemoan', 'standing', 'social', 'pariahs', 'argue', 'three', 'industries', 'most', 'deaths', 'annum', 'characters', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'overdrawn', 'turned', 'callous', 'villains', 'find', 'actually', 'liking', 'much', 'do', 'Naylor', 'partly', 'remain', 'loyal', 'buddy', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'world', 'fall', 'pieces', 'him.Indeed', 'feeling', 'ambivalence', 'have', 'towards', 'Naylor', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'more', 'just', 'anti-smoking', 'jeremiad', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'seductive', 'power', 'men', 'Naylor', 'aware', 'how', 'easily', 'too', 'fall', 'spell', 'Eckhart', 'so', 'charismatic', 'charming', 'convincing', 'role', 'Naylor', 'find', 'unusual', 'position', 'practically', 'rooting', 'prevail', 'even', 'intellectually', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'speciousness', 'arguments', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'not', 'softening', 'material', 'turning', 'Naylor', 'conventional', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'eventually', 'evils', 'ways', 'everything', 'power', 'make', 'reparations', 'damage', 'suffering', 'caused', 'even', 'Naylor', 'have', 'soft', 'likable', 'side', 'personality', ""n't"", 'always', 'enough', 'make', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'situation', 'make', 'politically', 'correct', 'speeches', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'coming', 'mouth', 'reformed', 'wrongdoer', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'clear', 'Naylor', 'reforms', 'only', 'up', 'point', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'flimflamery', 'lurking', 'core', 'genes', 'Moreover', 'Buckley', 'Reitman', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anti-smoking', 'forces', 'entirely', 'hook', 'movie', 'often', 'extreme', 'one', 'group', 'even', 'kidnaps', 'nicotine-poisons', 'Naylor', 'get', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'insufferably', 'self-righteous', 'petty', 'one', 'senator', 'digitally', 'erase', 'cigarettes', 'old', 'movies', '.Eckhart', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'never', 'having', 'achieved', 'superstar', 'status', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'dazzling', 'finely-tuned', 'turn', 'here', 'man', 'easy', 'criticize', 'hard', 'hate', 'bolstered', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Special', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'young', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'X-Men', '3', 'who', 'spirit', 'depth', 'role', 'Naylor', 'impressionable', 'clear-eyed', 'levelheaded', 'teenage', 'son', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'rarity', 'American', 'films', 'genuine', 'food', 'thought', 'amusing', 'heck', 'same', 'time']",N/A

But I was very disappointed.Its idea of making a lobbyist for a tobacco consortium the ""hero"" of the film held promise. This could have been an opportunity to satirize a lot of the political correctness that has been surrounding the whole subject of smoking and health and big business. But I don't think that promise was even remotely fulfilled in this film.What I saw was essentially (and no doubt inadvertently) just another dreary public service ad like the ones that lamely try to convince people not to smoke. The ads on TV pander to teens with slogans like ""Smoking stinks"" or ""Smoking isn't cool.""  In this movie the clich&eacute;d message is conveyed by having anyone who ever smoked die. The Marlboro Man, played here by Sam Elliott painted in embittered wasting purple hues - dies. When our lobbyist hero needs to talk to Mr. Big of the tobacco consortium, played by Robert Duvall, our hero can't because, of course, the Duvall character has - died.  I expected a lot more of this movie than such obvious lecturing.In addition to its overall failure though, I found this movie to be made up of many little failures. It's a series of non-sequiturs, loosely cobbled together.  The disconnect starts early with the lobbyist's opening monologue when he says, ""Manson kills; I talk.""Later, he gets kidnapped by some unidentified group, and is plastered over with nicotine patches. He survives this assault, but his system is left so compromised, he can never again take even one puff of a cigarette without risking death. I'm not aware of any medical consequence like that. Nevertheless, when he later defies Doctors' advice and takes a puff, he does pass out with near-fatal anoxia. This and a dozen other scenes are not funny exaggeration - they are simply ridiculous, random insertions.The writer's/director's lack of any coherent vision for this film becomes plainer yet if you watch the DVD extras, such as the deleted scenes. One of these shows the lobbyist coming down the steps of the Capitol after having delivered a rousing speech on freedom of choice before a Congressional Hearing Committee. As he pauses on the Capitol Building steps, his son (about 12-years-old?) takes a cigarette out of his pocket and starts to light up. His father, glancing over in alarm, slaps the cigarette out of the boy's hand. What was supposed to be the point of this scene - that the father is a hypocrite and is willing to override any ""freedom of choice"" argument when it comes to HIS son who is smoking? But why would such a young boy even be carrying cigarettes to such a formal occasion in the first place and why would he choose that most public moment to flaunt his smoking habit? It doesn't make sense! But the writer/director didn't axe this scene on the basis of logic. They say in their commentary that they loved the scene, but were forced to cut it simply for reasons of pacing.The DVD commentary overall reveals how flimsy and illogical this whole project was. That commentary degenerates into what is essentially just a round of good old boy jocularity and mutual admiration. The men involved in this project congratulate each other on every point. They praise the tricky brilliance of making the blinds in one scene into the shape of enlarged cigarettes. This touch is absolutely undetectable to the viewers, and would be meaningless even if evident.Then the actors and director repeatedly laud Christopher Buckley, who wrote the book on which this script is based. I can't help but think his father William's reputation for verbal cleverness got transferred to Christopher, unjustifiably at least in the case of this film.

1008773,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000H0MKO2,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 7]","There are two kinds of high school debate: the classic Lincoln-Douglas singular clash over morals and values, and the more obscure (but more prestigious and interesting) policy debate, in which a team of two develops a plan to address singular problem. Immigration, for example. Or health care. Or foreign policy. To sit in on a round of this debate is to inhabit a world where, according to the affirmative team, the apocalypse is imminent if the plan is not adopted, and, according to the negative team, apocalypse is imminent if it is. And the kids speed spit the words auctioneer-style, the better to overwhelm the opponent with evidence, arguments, subpoints. A judge has to sort it all out, take on faith that the evidence says what the kids says it does, and tab a victor.A lot of Washington lobbyists cut their teeth on this stuff, as do media pundits, lawyers, and GOP strategists named Karl Rove. Policy debate teaches a variant of the Michael Corleone philosophy: You can convince anyone of anything. Considering we live in an America that cuts taxes during a war we must win for our survival - but must also be won without a draft - well, this is a pretty true and murderous thing.So ""Thank You For Smoking,"" a clever satire about tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) just isn't sobering enough. It's engaging intellectually - enough so to recommend it - it's very funny, snarky, at times thoughtful. But writer-director Jason Reitman - son of 80s comedy icon Ivan Reitman - is comfortable right there. It's a solid debut, but he never lingers too greatly on Nick's life as a tool. Working from Christopher Buckley's novel, the movie puts Nick in a few tight spots and gives him pause, but its final scenes either reward Nick for his fraudulence or advance some libertarian philosophy not previously articulated. Nick may wiggle away to jerk chains for another focus group - but he's just running another hamster wheel.The lead lobbyist for an ""institute of tobacco studies,"" Nick is charged with insisting cigarettes are safe - he presents ""facts"" on talk shows and in congressional hearings - and fun, which he intends to do by partnering with a Hollywood agent/producer (Rob Lowe). He also has to pay off a former cigarette pitchman (Sam Elliott) dying of cancer while bedding an agenda-driven magazine reporter (Katie Holmes), which he fits around weekly lunches with The Merchants of Death, his lobbying pals from the alcohol and firearms industry. Nick's inquisitive son (Cameron Bright) is stuffed into several scenes as minor conscience, but mostly as a prompt for Nick's monologues about the American Way. And then there's a bizarre, left-field sequence that gives Nick a taste of the opposition and his own product.There's a lot happening, and a lot of faces for Nick to wear. But Eckhart nails it. Maybe too well - he's too likable and having too good a time. Unlike Eckhart's attractive-yet-amoral persona in ""In the Company of Men,"" Nick wears his burdens lightly, convinced his smooth resourcefulness can slip him out of jams. And it does, including a moment in which he's asked a question that any parent would answer one way, except Nick. Reitman's handling of this scene suggests he has a greater affinity for his lead than a sense for how pitiful it is to lie out of integrity for a faulty position. Reitman depicts of Holmes' character cynically too; reporters may not have scruples, but they have more savvy than this.We're left with a distinct, original portrait of America that preaches moral equivalency years after the Big Tobacco question has been answered. A smarter movie than ""Thank You for Smoking"" doesn't pretend Nick got out just before the roof caved in, but shows a tobacco lobbyist in post-lawsuit era free to admit cigarettes kill to a nation happy to smoke anyway. I'm looking at a courtyard full of smokers right now, who will return to work in 10 minutes to pass another wave of smokers. Few of them- maybe none of them - will see this movie.

Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and calls himself the Colonel Sanders of Nicotine.  He's divorced, but stays very involved in Joey's (his twelve year old son) life.  Joey (Cameron Bright - Running Scared, The Butterfly Effect) looks up to his father, often seeing him in a Godlike way.Nick belongs to what they call the MOD Squad (Merchants Of Death).  He and his two friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello - Secret Window) who works for the Moderation Council and is an alcoholic, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) who works for SAFETY (The Society for the Advancement of Firearms and Effective Training for Youth), meet for lunch one a week and discuss the deaths related to their current jobs.The movie begins with Nick appearing on the Joan Lunden show, against anti-tobacco groups and a young boy suffering from tobacco related cancer.  Nick, the best of the spin-artists, walks away smelling like a rose.  On his case over his defense of Big Tobacco is Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who leads a sub-committee dedicated to labeling cigarettes with the skull and crossbones poison symbol.Nick, while waiting for the sub-committee hearing, travels to see The Captain (Robert Duvall), head of the tobacco company and founder of Nick's employer.  Nick's boss stole his idea to use Hollywood to promote tobacco (by getting stars to smoke on screen) and the Captain wants Nick to fly to California to get the ball rolling.  Taking Joey along, Nick meets with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood super agent who heads up EGO (Entertainment Global Offices).  (Jeff and the whole Hollywood scene is so over-the-top ""typical"" that it's hilarious)  Jeff and Nick agree on 25 Million dollars to get Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones to smoke on screen after a futuristic $ex scene. (unbelievable!)  While in California, he takes a huge money payoff to the original Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott) who's now dying of lung cancer.  He also appears on the Dennis Miller show against Senator Finistirre, and receives a death threat from a caller.Nick comments on his life as being the most hated person on Earth.  It's pretty much true.  He's kidnapped, stripped, covered in nicotine patches and left at the Lincoln statue.  He almost dies and can never smoke again because of the overdose, but spins it into how cigarettes saved his life because a non-smoker would have died.  The reporter he's dating, Heather, takes all their private pillow talks and publishes an extremely derogatory article about him.  (You'll have to watch the movie to see how he pays her back)  Nick has to balance his life between his moral-less job and being a father to his son.  The things he teaches Joey aren't right or wrong but how to win, an approach Joey's mother disapproves of.Whether you're a non-smoker or even a smoker, the actions of the Big Tobacco will make you red with fury.  Eckhart plays a good role as Nick, totally unconcerned with his job as lobbyist for a known killer.  (as expressed in the meetings of the MOD Squad)  Though not based on a true story or even real statistical facts, the casual way Big Tobacco treats their ""customer's"" lives rings true.  Adding in Polly and Bobby Ray as advocates of alcohol and firearms holds a certain irony to the film.  Though the movie has a good premise (as far as satire goes) and an excellent cast who all perform well, it never quite advances itself into either comedy or drama.  The pace is a little to slow, and the debates not long enough or heated enough.  It's interesting enough if you want to watch a benignly evil man do his effort to spread poison, but not worthy of a purchase.  Rent first.

1008776,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000H0MKO2,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","Jason Reitman may have gotten into movies via nepotism (his dad is Ivan Retiman of ""Ghostbusters"" fame), but with ""Thank You for Smoking,"" he proves that he belongs in the game.  This is one of the smartest, funniest satires in years.Two things make the movie work.  The first is Reitman's restraint.  This is a movie about smoking, and yet we don't get any of the obvious scenes of people miserably puffing away on cigarettes, slowly killing themselves for our amusement.  Instead, nobody really smokes in the movie - the best humor in this situation, lies in America's hypocrisy about smoking rather than the act of smoking itself.""Thank You For Smoking"" examines the ludicrous truth that one of America's most profitable industries essentially kills 1,200 people a day.  And why does it do so?  For several reasons, but mainly because Americans are sheep willing to be sheared, so long as we are told what we want to hear.Enter Nick Naylor, played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart (""In the Company of Men,"" ""Erin Brockavich"").  Naylor is head spokesman for the tobacco industry, and he was born to do it.  The self-proclaimed Michael Jordan of spin can go onto a TV talk show, face an audience of sanctimonious nitwits who want nothing more than to boo the evil tobacco industry, and walk off the stage having received the handshake of a teenaged lung cancer victim and also having created the impression that the tobacco industry cares more about its customers' lives than the public interest groups who merely want a martyr.Naylor is riding high, and becomes the heir apparent to the Colonel (Robert Duvall), Mr. Big in Big Tobacco.  Naylor goes to Hollywood to negotiate with Mr. Hollywood (Rob Lowe) about getting cigarettes back into movies.  Naylor does this while lunching with fellow MOD Squad (""Merchant of Death"") members, lobbyists representing alcohol and firearms, and trying to educate his son about what is great about America.  Our greatness boils down to two things, Naylor tells his son - our endless appeals system, and the fact that if you can argue correctly, you are never wrong.Eckhart nails this role (pardon the pun).  What makes this a great performance is that Eckhart does not play Naylor as a true believer, either in tobacco or the morality of the game he plays.  He is just very, very good at his job, and he's got a mortgage.  ""99% of what goes on in the world, for good or evil, is motivated by the fact that people have to pay the mortgage.""Naylor's life takes a sudden turn south as he is (a) threatened with murder (and there is something about the threat that makes it realistic) and (b) starts sleeping with a probing journalist (Katie Holmes), when he should know better than nothing will be 'off the record.'

If you like your comedies crisp and caustic, you will probably get a kick out of this look at the absurd yet powerful world of corporate lobbyists.Rest assured, no one escapes unscathed. It takes an actor with a great deal of charm to pull off the role of a devious spin-doctor and still be likable, but Aaron Eckhart fits that to a tee. His scenes with his son are laced with such humor and dichotomous morality that they form some of the most engaging moments in the film. William Macy is always a stamp of high quality. Here, as a dogged senator with the right vision but poor debating acumen, he evokes just the right touch of sympathy and rancor.Whether you smoke or not, the banter is hilarious. For instance, the refrain ""The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly you're never wrong"" is probably baloney, but it is delivered with such pizazz that you nearly find yourself wanting to believe it. The script is strewn with memorable quips, but it all leads to a denouement that has its heart in the right place.The DVD is very satisfactory. Besides several interviews with the production team, it also contains almost a dozen deleted scenes, many of which are interesting, but one appreciates the editing effort that led to their exclusion. There's also an interesting mini-feature with the cast and crew that admits that the film should leave audiences laughing but also asking some educated questions. Oddly enough, Eckhart is the only one who sees the movie as a straight comedy and not political in its undertones.All in all, this one's a keeper. Get it.

SMOKING's key character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in the performance of his career to date), is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic.  Divorced, with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for, Naylor believes that Americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will.  He knows he manufactures a product that causes death, but he can be wickedly hilarious about it.  Like with Cancer Boy on THE JOAN LUNDEN SHOW:  ""Why would I want this young boy to die?  We would lose one more potential adult smoker.""  Then he invades an elementary school classroom, where one little girl tells him, ""My Mommy says that cigarettes can kill you.""  ""Oh?  Is your Mommy a doctor?  A scientific researcher?  Then maybe she doesn't have all the facts.""  This is a hysterically funny and inspired satire.Curiously, the villain of the piece may be William H. Macy as the unpleasant Vermont Senator who sells ""cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks,"" replies Nick.  Nick also has a reporter (DAWSON CREEK's Katie Holmes) want to do a story on him; the two end up as literally strange bedfellows.  Meanwhile, the head of the Tobacco Lobby, Robert Duvall, dies of lung cancer.  And the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for Americans' rights to drink and fire guns, hopefully not at the same time.The source here is a novel by Christopher Buckley and it must be a lulu.  It would be fun to know whether or not Mr. Buckley smokes.  I am a lifelong non-smoker with asthma.  Nick Naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke, knowing the dangers of cigarettes.  The movie makes such a complex case for both sides, which is a tribute to director Reitman's brilliant screenplay.  One wishes both it and Eckhart's fabulous performance could be Oscar nominees next Spring for this 2006 comedy delight.  But the whole cast is a dream--Macy, Holmes, Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody; and the dialogue is brilliant.  If you want a good time at the movies, don't even consider missing the wonderfully funny THANK YOU FOR SMOKING on DVD.The movie is in Panavision and letterboxed on DVD.  Bonuses include a superb CHARLIE ROSE SHOW with Buckley, Reitman, Eckhart, and producer David O.

The script is filled with insider information, however, which delightfully skewers Big Tobacco. Our hero Nick Naylor has four tasks: (1) make sure the cigarette makers' announced fifty-million-dollar campaign to dissuade teenagers from smoking has the opposite effect; (2) negotiate product placement in glamorous Hollywood; (3) somehow regain the respect of his pre-teen son, who despises everything his father stands for; and (4) obstruct a Vermont senator's campaign to require a skull-and-crossbones on every pack.

I thought it was one of the best films around. It was smart, witty, and spoke volumes about the hypocrisy of the anti-smoking attitudes.No, I'm not a smoker but I'm not a zealot neither. I don't need Atlantic City to become smoke free. It would lose it's appeal as the only place in New Jersey where smoking is not only tolerated but allowed. Have we become a society where smoking is villified as public enemy number? Smoking is a choice. We know all the dangers about it from the cigarette pack labels and how smoking kills you.Yes, smoking can lead to lung cancer, emphysema, and heart problems but so can stress, anxiety, and unhealthy eating habits. The health food gestapo is already on our case about that we drink and eat poorly. Yes, I know soda is not good for me healthwise but I can't change my habits after a lifetime. I know that eating chocolate, cheese, and junk food is unhealthy but it's still my choice.Smokers have the right to choose to stop smoking or continue. The smokers who blame their addictions on the smoking industry are looking for compensation for their addiction when it was themselves who placed the cigarette in their mouths without force. Smoking is not healthy and probably caused my father to die sooner than he should but I don't blame the tobacco industry for our country's ills.You are far more dangerous to get killed by somebody talking on his/cell phone while driving. Smoking is used by most smokers to alleave the stress and anxiety in their lives. If you can cure stress and anxiety for all of us, we wouldn't need smoking or any other vice like caffeine to stop us. Until then, let smokers be who and what they are.

Suckers who are willing to forgo every piece of information available as long as they have one person telling them what they want to believe is right, as long as it's what they want to hear. Into this void steps Nick Naylor (Adam Eckhart), a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, whose job is convincing everyone to take a rolled up tube of paper stuffed with carcinogens, set it on fire and suck the fumes into your body because you have the right to do so. Naylor is the best in the biz, making everyone around him take pratfalls while he tries to be a good dad to his precocious son (unfortunately a clich&eacute;d part, played up by Cameron Bright).While predominantly a satire on spin and the gullibility of consumers, ""Thank You For Smoking"" often misses the bulls-eye for the very thing its premise is based on: SPIN. No-one in the movie smokes. Even the wizened old Patriarch of the firm (played great by Robert Duvall) never lights one up, even as he tells everyone about his great discoveries. Naylor is momentarily seen fidgeting with an empty pack, but that's as close as it gets. It gets difficult to believe the bleating about being too PC when everyone in the film as politically correct as they can be. Even Katie Holmes, as a sleazy journalist, gets one-upped by the ever cunning Naylor.This is a deep and darkly funny film, but it just doesn't go far enough. The best film in this genre, the Political SatireWag the Dog, both hit the funny bone and slugged your gut, while TYFS pulls the final punches after about 2/3's of the way in by taking away Naylor's smarminess and turning him into a Disney Dad. Satire can be outrageous, but there also has to be an endgame. The feel-good ending here seems tacked on rather than thought through. It was fun watching Nick spar with the hapless Senator (William H. Macy, delightful as always), but had his name been something less convoluted than Ortolan Finistirre, it might have been less of an obvious ploy. (Ooo look! All American Lobbyist takes on nerdy Gov-Wonk with dopey name!)""Thank You For Smoking"" wussed out when it really could've taken the Spin-Zone to task.

He plays a ""lobbyist,"" Nick Naylor, for the Institute of Tobacco Study, or some such bogus concoction the likes of which acutally existed when I was in grad school. Playing that role, he's able to justify anything he does, to come up with even more bizarre rationalizations than you and I, with our senses of humor, could come up with. When he's cornered with why he does that, he thinks briefly and says, ""The mortgage.""For your trivial information, and perhaps a little of an irony, the DC building they uses for this tobacco lobbying outfit is the US Dept. of Health and Human Services. That broke me up.Of course, he's part of a threesome: the MOD (Merchants of Death) squad consisting of a woman working for the alcohol industry (thought they attributed her membership, I think, to Moderation Management, which is an honorable alternative to the ubiquitous and ideological/religious 12-step mania, not a front for alcohol) and a guy who represents, you got it, firearms.Naylor comes up with an idea or two, is sent to meet with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe) who claims he's a ""facilitator."" He just brings people together with ideas. Yeah. And they come up with a film idea, starring Brad Pitt and some woman flame (sorry, I'm not good with show-biz names) sharing sexual ecstacy before having several smokes.Lowe's aide, by the way, is a caricature of everying California, and is award material despite his short role.Well, the problems start when Naylor has lunch with a reporter. While they're---intimate---he spills the beans. What he didn't bargain for was that she'd print what he said!His career is over, right? It seemed that way. But he had the shrewd idea of making himself the victim! And it worked!The funny thing is, just the afternoon I saw the film, I was reading about one of a recent Republican hit man--I don't remember if it was Ollie North--if not is was someone in a similar political role, who broke the law, then spun the situation to make himself the victim. And a good portion of the public bought it.Naylor ends up leaving the tobacco lobbying outfit--which went belly up after a multi-billion dollar settlement. But he opens his own consulting firm where he trains people to be as effectively evasive as he is. Then the three-member MOD squad also adds reps from the fast food, oil, and hazardous waste industries...and the hits keep on comin'.Oh, and I can't leave out one of my favorites: William H. Macy. In fact, he's what drove me to see the film. He plays Senator Ortalan Finnister from Vermont who's zealously fighting tobacco. Just the looks on his face make the film worth seeing. And there are others to add charm to the story.Of course, it was a satire, therefore a caricature of what really goes on. But, what with the scandals overwhelming the capital these days, we find they aren't TOO much of a caricature.And, again, Eckardt's now on the map.

1008797,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000H0MKO2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues.Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company.The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch.Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J.

1008798,ACQ2YU0CP68WC,B000H0MKO2,Turiel,"[1, 1]","""Thank you for smoking"" is an easy to digest ""Black comedy""(I use the term loosely) that seems to use precise as a snipers shot methods at minorly offending traditional PC norms.  Although those methods are often the bits that keep the story moving along.  It should only really offend those who are extra sensative about being politically correct, or who are stuck in a pre 1995 pop culture mindset(so any politican).The story itself is rather predictable, but I think its meant to be, and thats whats comforting about it.  The pace of the story keeps good, and the way the film is shot vaguely reminds me of much of the cinematography of Fight Club, which is a good thing.  As far as comedy's go lately this has been one of the few of late that hasn't made me feel brain dead due to endless frat boy humor.  The comedy is sharp enough to keep the attention of your more jaded movie goer, but not so sharp that the previously mentioned frat boy would be left out in the cold.  Also the narration in the movie is a nice touch, I believe this movie comes out of a novel, so i'm not suprised at the amount of narration given.  My favorate moment of the film is when he explains that when he flys on company buisness, that if he can convince one person to start smoking, he has paid for his tickets round trip.

I love the dark and very smart humor. It was well written, had a fantastic cast and the acting was superior. Now as I am writing this and thinking that this movie was just great and flawless... I remember one glaring FLAW. Katey Holmes was completely and totally miscast. I can only imagine that she got the role because of her recent publicity filled relationship with the grinny idiot Tom Cruise and their sham relationship. The character is described by somebody in the cast before you even meet her as this bombshell babe of a reporter with great chest that would melt and had melted many a man into spilling his guts. So who do we get? Who is this brick you know what house that can seduce any man? Why it is 14 year old looking and acting Katey 'Kate' (to her grinning ingnoramous of a sudo husband) Holmes. I don't think much of her in any role unless it is of a 14 year old and certainly she was totally miscast in this movie that has cast every other character dead on. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine them filling this cast with Aaron Ekhart, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Maria Bello or anybody else in this top notch cast and then saying, ""you know who we should get for the bombshell sexpot reporter?!!! Why let's get KATEY HOLMES!!!"" And somebody saying, ""I have to have her! She is our first and only choice!""

Taking the most demonized now of our society's legal but dangerous products, the cigarette, through Nick Naylor, the lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry in Washington, D.C. the film provokes thought about how we judge people.Instead of playing Naylor as simply an overly slick salesman, the story shows Naylor, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, as a committed father trying to create a better relationship with his son. Through this dedicated parenting we see the smiling lobbyist as a real person fighting the good fight for a losing side. An air of admiration actually takes hold for Naylor as everyone does have bills to pay. Therefore the movie is littered with points of view that in an entertaining fashion reveal how ludicrous much of our condemnation is towards what most people understand to be a dangerous product. Naylor is clearly fantastic at the game of spin, but so is everyone else who is in the game of trying to shape public opinion. Therefore even the public servant trying to put a skull and cross bones on cigarette packs or the dying cancer victim railing against the tobacco industry is revealed to be very good at the same manipulations and/or carry the same self-centered motivations as a skilled tobacco lobbyist.The questions then that Thank You For Smoking keeps asking is when has our scorn towards Naylor gone too far, as every good argument does need a counter-argument.",5,Delicious politically incorrect film,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1534,"['Thank', 'Smoking', 'delicious', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'film', 'fun', 'knee-jerk', 'PC', 'nature', 'most', 'unlikely', 'ways', 'Taking', 'most', 'demonized', 'now', 'society', 'legal', 'dangerous', 'products', 'cigarette', 'Nick', 'Naylor', 'lead', 'lobbyist', 'tobacco', 'industry', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'film', 'provokes', 'thought', 'how', 'judge', 'people.Instead', 'playing', 'Naylor', 'simply', 'overly', 'slick', 'salesman', 'story', 'Naylor', 'portrayed', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'committed', 'father', 'trying', 'create', 'better', 'relationship', 'son', 'dedicated', 'parenting', 'see', 'smiling', 'lobbyist', 'real', 'person', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'losing', 'side', 'air', 'admiration', 'actually', 'hold', 'Naylor', 'everyone', 'have', 'bills', 'pay', 'movie', 'littered', 'points', 'view', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'reveal', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'much', 'condemnation', 'towards', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'understand', 'be', 'dangerous', 'product', 'Naylor', 'clearly', 'fantastic', 'game', 'spin', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'game', 'trying', 'shape', 'public', 'opinion', 'Therefore', 'even', 'public', 'servant', 'trying', 'put', 'skull', 'cross', 'bones', 'cigarette', 'packs', 'dying', 'cancer', 'victim', 'railing', 'tobacco', 'industry', 'revealed', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'same', 'manipulations', 'and/or', 'carry', 'same', 'self-centered', 'motivations', 'skilled', 'tobacco', 'lobbyist.The', 'questions', 'then', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'keeps', 'asking', 'when', 'scorn', 'towards', 'Naylor', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'good', 'argument', 'need', 'counter-argument']",N/A

It's evil. It kills. Everything kills. It's not smoking that kills. It's people killing people by making the choice to smoke. It's all about choices. Your choice, my choice everyone's choice smoking is a choice just like driving, deciding to get out of bed and having a mammogram. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) makes a living using this type of logic (and debating with little girls among others) and justifying the existence and use of cigarettes by everyone. He's a lobbyist. He's there to argue that common sense and decency are malleable. He works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies where most of the studies about smoking goes on. That's like letting companies dictate the studies that should be done about their medication; they'll always design the studies to the best effect for the company. Nick uses the same arguments that Captains of Industry use to excuse gouging you for gas, medicine and any other essentials in life. Naylor and his friends (The MOD Squad or merchants of death) justify their existence by protecting the corporations of the world via spin. The spin suddenly changes when he becomes more than hated but a target and has to examine his core values.Brilliantly acted, scripted and directed by Jason Reitman the film brilliantly captures Christopher Buckley's book without being too literal. ""Thank You for Smoking"" features perfect casting as well. Aaron Eckhart is probably our most underrated actor. He's brilliant at playing confident and conflicted equally well.It's a marvelous film.Some of the special features are cooler than what you'll find in a carton of Kool; We get a feature length commentary one with Jason Reitman solo and a second with the director and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. There are also deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman. ""The Charlie Rose Show"" episode featuring Buckley, producer David Sax, Aaron Eckhart and director Reit man discussing the challenges of translating Buckley's novel to the screen also appears.""Unfiltered Comedy"" is a making of featurette with the standard clips and talking heads but it's the comments that make it worthwhile to watch. ""America: Living in Spin"" features plenty of clips from the film along with cast and crew discussing the world of spin that we live in where everything bad can be good. We also get a trio of galleries including poster art, behind-the-scenes stills and a storyboard which focuses on the first 15 minutes of the film. From the storyboard it looks to me like they were originally aiming for Oprah for the talk show. We wind things up with the theatrical trailer and a promo spot for the inspired soundtrack.A very funny book gets a very funny cinematic translation to the screen.

1008804,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000H0MKO2,Wheelchair Assassin,"[18, 28]","If you're anything like me, you've probably gotten pretty annoyed by the anti-smoking crowd these days.  I swear, if cigarettes are cancer, some of these people are chemotherapy.  We've all seen those obnoxious TRUTH ads where a bunch of unkempt, college-know-it-all types harass people trying to do their jobs and use all kinds of manipulative devices and questionable ""facts"" to push their anti-cigarette agenda (I should note in passing that I've never had a cigarette in my life, so I don't have a horse in this particular race).  With their prohibitive taxes and bans on smoking on private property, they've become even more controlling and arrogant lately, as they've done everything but force smokers to enjoy their habit in their basements while wearing haz-mat suits and spraying a fire extinguisher after each puff.  Whatever happened to personal choice?  Whatever happened to independent thought?  Whatever happened to open and honest debate?  Well, Thank You For Smoking is here to address those very questions for your viewing pleasure, with plenty of hilarious moments to accompany its amoral anti-message.Based on the excellent comic novel by Christopher Buckley, Thank You For Smoking isn't a satire so much as a classic black comedy in the Dr. Strangelove mold (not to say this movie is as good as Dr. Strangelove; I'm not about to commit movie heresy), aiming less to critique anything in particular than to defend the indefensible, so to speak.  The indefensible in this case is Nick Naylor, divorced father and fast-talking vice-president of the Academy for Tobacco Studies, a Washington firm that lobbies on behalf of Big Tobacco.  In lieu of a conventional plot, the movie basically just consists of a series of looks into Nick's life and work, with tons of little asides, flashbacks, and voice-overs from Nick giving it a sort of stream-of-consciousness feel.  The tone of the whole thing is pretty slick and smirky, but given its subject matter and protagonist I really don't think it could've worked any other way.  Aaron Eckhardt, who hasn't really impressed me that much in the past, was seemingly born for the role of Nick, as he pretty much embodies what I imagine a tobacco lobbyist would have to be like: cynical, smarmy, and utterly resistant to idealism of any sort.  He's made himself a pretty nice living by exempifying the truism that if you argue correctly you're never wrong, and he always manages to find a way to undercut the emotional appeals of the moralists who think they have him in a rhetorical corner.  Nick is actually rather similar to Nicolas Cage's soulless gun dealer from Lord of War, but not quite as much of a moral vacuum.  Nick's a friendly enough type, and a good dad to his too-smart-for-his-age son, but his line of work has made him very good at compartmentalizing and playing the role of devil's advocate.  I for one couldn't help but like the guy, especially since many of those on the other side were so obnoxious.  Besides, he's gotta pay the mortgage somehow, as he points out in what he terms the ""yuppie Nuremberg defense.""It also helps that for such a short movie, Thank You For Smoking manages to generate a lot of memorable supporting characters, even if it doesn't quite have the time to develop them all.  Thankfully, Nick's informal membership in the MOD (as in Merchants of Death) squad, one of my favorite aspects of the novel, made it into the movie, and the roles of Nick's compatriots were cast about as well as you could hope for.  Maria Bello was a bit underused as alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, but she's still just as great as she was in A History of Violence, and David Koechner is brilliantly over the top in the role of vaguely rednecky gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss (sure, it's not all that different from the role he played in Anchorman, but it's funny just the same).  The MOD Squad's lunch meetings provide some of the most blackly funny moments in the movie, as Nick, Polly, and Bobby Jay compare strategies and death tolls and argue about who's the most hated.  It's sort of interesting in a morbid way, seeing three people brought together by the common bond of their seemingly despicable jobs.Going outside Nick's main circle, the movie provides a pretty unflattering portrayal of those who inhabit Washington in general, which isn't really anything new but still ends up being pretty refreshing in this case.  If there's one thing Thank You For Smoking makes clear, it's that lobbyists aren't the only people in the District with their hands dirty.  The movie shows us a political climate where pretty much everybody has a hidden agenda, from Katie Holmes's scheming reporter to J.K. Simmons's backstabbing boss to William H. Macy's grandstanding senator, all of whom make Nick look downright decent.  Indeed, the most honorable character in the movie is probably The Captain, the drawling, unreconstructed tobacco magnate who founded Nick's lobbying firm.  Brought to memorable life by Robert Duvall in what's basically a series of cameos, the Captain may have gotten rich by selling a hazardous product, the movie seems to be saying, but at least he's not bullying or manipulating people.In the end, how much you like Thank You For Smoking will probably come down to your stance on smoking itself.  If you think cigarettes are a scourge and those who produce them the embodiment of evil, you probably won't be able to make much of a connection with this movie's impious stance.  However, if you think the U.S of late has become too PC, too uptight, and too totalitarian, you'll probably appreciate seeing something that (at least partially) turns the moral tables for once.  Sure, it probably won't change the world, but Thank You For Smoking should at least help you laugh at it.",4,Movie funny,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,5777,"[""'re"", 'anything', ""'ve"", 'probably',

Adams,"[3, 3]","It would be difficult to live up to the hype I heard about this film, and in fact, the movie does not quite rise, in my opinion, to the estatic reviews I read several months ago when it was on the big screen in big cities. There are indeed some big laughs, and many smiles and smirks generated by the cynical story line: honorable man, good dad, makes a living shilling for a horrid product. Along the way he meets and beds a dishonorable reporter, confronts and bests sleazy talk show hosts and Congressmen, and tries to balance loving his son with a public promise to ""buy him his first pack of cigarettes when he turns 18 if he wants them."" It was an interesting choice for the film's creators to try to humanize a tobacco lobbyist, and in my view, they succeeded at that. Despite despising the product he promotes, I had to root for Nick to prevail in his various trials. If there could exist such a compliment as ""At least he is honestly dishonest"" Nick would have earned it.

This movie was actually very funny and pointed out a number of thing that I think we all realize but never verbalize.  This is based in the late 90's prior to the tobacco settlement, the main character is a Lobbyist for the tobbacco industry.  It explores his job and his life and why he did the job. Many people write him off as a murderer, but this movie adresses this and more.  Throw in his dinner meetings with his Lobbyist friends from Alcohol and Firearms, I would not have thought i could laugh at the movie, but I did. The movie was well written, great voiceovers where needed, and dialog flowed well.  The movie is best summed up by one of the lines ""you have to pay the mortgage"".

I truly owe my friend, because this is the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a while.  I'm reasonably conservative, and on first glance, a film of this type might not seem to cater to those interests.  It certainly serves a good deal of criticism to industries that conservatives typically fight for.The film, however, comes across as very even-handed.  This is accomplished by making the protagonist, Nick Naylor expertly played by Aaron Eckhart, very likeable and human.  Whereas many dark comedies go the route of complete darkness, this film has enough hope and humanity to seem both a dark comedy and a drama.As others have mentioned, the cast is full of big names.  Aaron Eckhart, Maria Bello, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes (good here) and many other recognizeable faces all ensure that the film is expertly acted.  Perhaps what really gives the comedic element its punch is that you really end up caring about the characters, and Eckhart's acting is a large component of that.  I haven't liked Eckhart before primarily because the movies he was in were mediocre (Suspect Zero, Paycheck).  After seeing this, I'll have to look out for his other stuff.The comedy, itself, almost feels like a buffet.  While tobacco is the main target, a variety of topics are parodied, and typically both sides of the argument are lambasted. CAUTION: you may want to be careful about eating or drinking during the movie- I nearly choked on my drink twice because one part or another was just so shockingly funny.Finally, I'll mention the score because it kicks in during important sequences and almost feels like its own character.  It buttresses the emotional elements of character relationships and also does a godd job characterizing the original smoking establishment (you'll see).I've tried to stay away from specifics because I found the film to be such a refreshing surprise and I don't want to ruin it.
