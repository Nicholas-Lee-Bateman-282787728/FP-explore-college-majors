807931,A240SFVTFJRCPG,B0001JXOMG,C. Davis,"[0, 0]",What a sad story.  But it is true.  This mother's love is so great that she gives her daughter a better life even though she must abandon her to do it!  The difficulty she has is enormous but she always has her daughter's safety and well-being first on her mind.  Truly a story of biblical wisdom.  Does the Mother keep her child and condemn her to a life of poverty; or does she give her child a better life and a future by letting someone else raise her child knowing that she will never see her again?
