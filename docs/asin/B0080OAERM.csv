1540704,ARPZ2W2XKD11Z,B0080OAERM,Anthony,"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s.  Christopher Collet was outstanding playing the part of Jake in this movie.  The only other movies I saw him in were The Manhattan Project (also an excellent movie), Prayer of the Rollerboys, and The Langoliers.  I always wondered why he didn't act in more movies than this because he is such a strong actor.  Peter Weller was also a standout actor in this movie ... he was very convincing.  He played the part so well that he made me not like him at all ... that is, I didn't like the character at all.  He probably should have been nominated for an academy award for this part.  This was Corey Haim's first movie, and he also did an excellent job.  And Teri Garr I have always been a fan of ... this is perhaps her best performance in a dramatic role.  The movie seemed realistic to me ... it's the kind of movie that draws you in and you believe that everything you're seeing is really happening ...  and you actually relate to them and care about them as people.  I really felt bad for the two kids and what they were having to go through.

This movie veers to the darker side of a family affected by divorce and integration of a new adult into the family. Both boys give genuine roles and display traits of changes that come when a single parent starts to date. Corey Haim's character is an innocent boy but who is wise beyond his years. The scene where he ends up in the principal's office shows the confusion and anger children often display in situations like this. Jake tries to save his mother and keep his cool at the same time but slips from time to time: lashing out at his friend the young Robert Downey Jr. and then again misbehaving in class.A movie about youth who are confused and troubled by the changes in their own home yet cannot do much about them.

To be honest, the only thing that really links this film to that time is the music.The kids are the heroes in this film.  The adults are completely ineffectual, checked out, self-absorbed or bullies.  Set against the backdrop of a ""good"" neighborhood and a ""good"" school, the kids are the ones who have to make the rational decisions, as the principal adults can't or won't.  Christopher Collet and Corey Haim do a remarkable job of conveying frustration, fear and strength in this film.  Terri Garr plays their weak mom fairly sympathetically, but it's hard not to dislike her character.  Peter Weller plays her villain boyfriend to slimy perfection, but he comes off like such a weak loser, it's not surprising Christoher Collet's character could kick his ass. I think the character would have been stronger and more malevolent had an actor like Tommy Lee Jones been given the part.
