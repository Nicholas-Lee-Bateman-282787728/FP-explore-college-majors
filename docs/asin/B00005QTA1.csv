The story is supposed to be based on Shirley Temple Black's autobiography ""Child Star"" and I only saw a handful of items that were actually taken from the book, the rest of it was just fluff. Plus they didn't go past Shirley's early teens when the book covers up until after she marries her second husband. They seemed to only want to focus on the happy aspects of Shirley's life but she and her family were not always so happy go lucky. Ashley Orr is horrific at playing Shirley-first of all she's too old to play 5,6,7 and even 8 year old Shirley and she was too sticky sweet, I know Shirley was too but not that sweet. I would have actually given this movie 0 stars if I had the option, it was horrible. So if you want to know the real story find her book ""Child Star"" and if you want to see the real Shirley work her magic on the screen go find any of her movies and stay away from this one.""Bright eyes"" , ""Heidi"" , and ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" are good movies to start off with.",1,Check out the real Shirley instead,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1156,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'played', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'Shirley', 'fan', 'was', '9', ""'m"", 'now', '21', 'when', 'was', 'watched', 'was', 'highly', 'dissapointed', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Black', 'autobiography', 'Child', 'Star', 'only', 'saw', 'handful', 'items', 'were', 'actually', 'taken', 'book', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'fluff', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'past', 'Shirley', 'early', 'teens', 'when', 'book', 'up', 'second', 'husband', 'seemed', 'only', 'want', 'focus', 'happy', 'aspects', 'Shirley', 'life', 'family', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'Ashley', 'Orr', 'horrific', 'playing', 'Shirley-first', 'too', 'old', 'play', '5,6,7', 'even', '8', 'year', 'old', 'Shirley', 'was', 'too', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'know', 'Shirley', 'was', 'too', 'not', 'sweet', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'given', 'movie', '0', 'stars', 'had', 'option', 'was', 'horrible', 'So', 'want', 'know', 'real', 'story', 'find', 'book', 'Child', 'Star', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'Shirley', 'work', 'magic', 'screen', 'go', 'find', 'movies', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'Bright', 'eyes', 'Heidi', 'Poor', 'Little', 'Rich', 'Girl', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'start', 'off']",N/A

The movie does a good job of setting the time period, the depression by using newsreel footage and radio broadcasts. Many of her most famous routines are faithfully recreated, sometimes as clips from the movies, other times as if they were filming the movie.The acting is good. Ashley Rose Orr ""sparkles"" as Shirley (Shirley's mother always told her to ""sparkle""). It's tough recreating a living legend, but she can sing and dance and act quite well, although she did say ""Oh, my goodness"" a bit too many times. Connie Britton is good as Shirley's mother, although Colin Friel is bland as her father. A standout is Hinton Battle as Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson.Shirley Temple fans will enjoy this movie. She's one of those rare child stars who seems well-adjusted, so there's nothing really controversial in the film. Anything that is controversial, such as Shirley's father spending almost all her money, is sugar-coated, perhaps because Shirley was a consultant on the movie. Unfortunately, the movie veers off course in the end by showing Shirley as a teenager. A much better ending would have been her leaving the 20th Century Fox studios when they terminated her contract.DVD extras include an audio commentary by Melissa Joan Hart, who produced the movie along with her mother, and an interesting feature on the making of the movie.",3,Nice Look Back,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1468,"['Based', 'autobiography', 'Child', 'Star', 'story', 'fame', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'perhaps', 'most', 'loved', 'child', 'star', 'time', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'time', 'period', 'depression', 'using', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'Many', 'most', 'famous', 'routines', 'are', 'faithfully', 'recreated', 'sometimes', 'clips', 'movies', 'other', 'times', 'were', 'filming', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Ashley', 'Rose', 'Orr', 'sparkles', 'Shirley', 'Shirley', 'mother', 'always', 'told', 'sparkle', 'tough', 'recreating', 'living', 'legend', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'act', 'quite', 'well', 'did', 'say', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'good', 'Shirley', 'mother', 'Colin', 'Friel', 'bland', 'father', 'standout', 'Hinton', 'Battle', 'Bill', 'Bojangles', 'Robinson.Shirley', 'Temple', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'child', 'stars', 'who', 'well-adjusted', 'nothing', 'really', 'controversial', 'film', 'Anything', 'controversial', 'such', 'Shirley', 'father', 'spending', 'almost', 'money', 'sugar-coated', 'perhaps', 'Shirley', 'was', 'consultant', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'veers', 'off', 'course', 'end', 'showing', 'Shirley', 'teenager', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'leaving', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'studios', 'when', 'terminated', 'contract.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'who', 'produced', 'movie', 'mother', 'interesting', 'feature', 'making', 'movie']",N/A

Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than Temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as the Shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her on screen or off screen persona. So what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If one wants to see that side of her, one can just watch one of her movies.

The songs and dances are very enjoyable. But the DVD edition has very few bonuses, although they're really good.

Ashley Rose Orr does a great acting job here, although I don't think she looked much like the real Shirley Temple. Sure, she had those same dimples and the curls, but I didn't see as much of a resemblance as I thought I would. But that doesn't matter, because it's Ashley Rose Orr's energy and adorable smile that made her believable as Shirley Temple, the little girl who stole the hearts of people worldwide during the Great Depression. The song and dance numbers were performed extremely well by Orr, and she was well supported by Connie Britton and Colin Friels, who portrayed Shirley's parents in the movie. I just found this to be a really sweet movie which gives viewers a good background on Shirley's younger life in the moviemaking business. Like Cherie Hapney, I'm also disappointed that Shirley Temple didn't get the part of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" although Judy Garland did play the part well.

Based on Shirley Temple Black's autobiographyChild Star(Black was also a consultant on the film), and co-executive-produced by Melissa Joan Hart of TV's SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH, this film is a lovely tribute to Shirley, with newcomer Ashley Rose Orr magnificent in the title role.  Emily Hart, Melissa's sister, plays the older Shirley in later scenes.  Hinton Battle does a magnificent job as legendary tapper Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, and choreographed the entire movie, reproducing the dance numbers perfectly (almost identically, in fact, to the originals from Shirley's movies).  The DVD contains audio commentary from Melissa Joan Hart, a ""making-of"" mini-doc, and English, French, and Spanish subtitles.I have ten Shirley Temple movies on DVD.  A few years ago, I purchasedCaptain January,Little Miss Broadway,Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm,Just Around the Corner, andYoung People.  More recently, I addedStand Up and Cheer!,Curly Top, and theShirley Temple - America's Sweetheart Collection, Vol. 3 (Dimples / The Little Colonel / The Littlest Rebel)to my collection.  Unfortunately, my favorite Shirley movie of all,Poor Little Rich Girl, which has the great ""Military Man"" number, Shirley's best tap routine ever in my opinion, has yet to be released on DVD in this country, only on VHS, although there is a French version available, which cannot be played on U.S. DVD players.  I hope that 20th-Century Fox Home Entertainment corrects this oversight soon.Had Shirley Temple remained in musical comedy as an adult, she probably would have challenged Ann Miller and Eleanor Powell for Hollywood's Queen of Tap Dancing; she was that good, even as a child.  Her later dramatic films didn't work, and it was probably fortunate that she gave up show business and had a happy ""second life"" with second husband Charles Black, who passed away in 2005.  Shirley ably served her country as a diplomat and ambassador, became a mother and grandmother, and received a well-deserved Kennedy Center Honor in 1998.  Given the tragic fate of so many other child stars who battled drug abuse, alcoholism, and depression, and, in some cases, eventually passed away - think of the late Gary Coleman and Dana Plato for starters - Shirley Temple Black made the right choice. Her long, wonderful life finally ended on February 10, 2014, when she passed away in her California home at age 85, two months before her 86th birthday.God bless you, Ambassador Shirley Temple Black - we love you!
