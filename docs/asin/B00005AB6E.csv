Like other reviewers, I think he's vastly underrated (in the same vein as Michael Franks, Al Jarreau, Fran Sinatra). But Kenny's got a much better voice. He moves across octaves without the obvious breaks that mere mortals have.  What's more amazing to me is that his voice is as rock solid on stage as others can get in a studio.This is a nice foray into jazz.  Ans this is clearly a good CD. But, like most live albums, the sounds quality isn't as good as a studio recording. The issue is one of the superior acoustics and recording quality of a studio. (Of course, there are those who talk about the ""energy"" and such of the live performance.  But ""energy"" sounds strange in the context of Kenny's laid-back style.)So, for straight sound quality, pick up a studio CD. To appreciate what he can do live, this DVD or the ""Bottom Line Encore"" CD will get you started until he makes it to your town.",4,Not the best recording ever,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,919,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Kenny', 'fan', 'other', 'reviewers', 'think', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'same', 'vein', 'Michael', 'Franks', 'Al', 'Jarreau', 'Fran', 'Sinatra', 'Kenny', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'voice', 'octaves', 'obvious', 'breaks', 'mere', 'mortals', 'have', 'What', 'more', 'amazing', 'voice', 'rock', 'solid', 'stage', 'others', 'can', 'get', 'studio.This', 'nice', 'foray', 'jazz', 'Ans', 'clearly', 'good', 'CD', 'most', 'live', 'albums', 'sounds', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'studio', 'recording', 'issue', 'one', 'superior', 'acoustics', 'recording', 'quality', 'studio', 'course', 'are', 'who', 'talk', 'energy', 'such', 'live', 'performance', 'energy', 'strange', 'context', 'Kenny', 'laid-back', 'style', 'So', 'straight', 'sound', 'quality', 'pick', 'up', 'studio', 'CD', 'appreciate', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'live', 'DVD', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Encore', 'CD', 'will', 'get', 'started', 'town']",The Jazz Channel Presents Kenny Rankin

Not through any fault of this concert.  This is really good. The best I've ever heard (or seen) him.  Really shows off his vocal abilities. Filmed before a small audience, in a way it makes a more intimate setting. Like many of the jazz channel productions, sound guality is excellent (dts), ditto on video quality.  Camera work is not terribly exciting.  And I would have made just a few changes in song selection.

576785,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00005AB6E,Craig Connell,"[2, 2]","This is about as mellow and pleasant as you'll find in a nightclub ""act.""  Kenny has to be one of the more relaxed, down-home singers I've seen. He talks to you as if it's just you and he face to face, commenting briefly before each song.  He not only has a pleasing manner but a very pleasing, soft voice.The songs are all mellow, with just Kenny, his guitar and a bass player here, a pianist there or soft drumming.  This is nice, light jazz when you want to chill.It's nice....real nice.",4,Chillin' With Kenny,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,490,"['about', 'mellow', 'pleasant', ""'ll"", 'find', 'nightclub', 'act', 'Kenny', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'relaxed', 'down-home', 'singers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'face', 'face', 'commenting', 'briefly', 'song', 'not', 'only', 'pleasing', 'manner', 'very', 'pleasing', 'soft', 'voice.The', 'songs', 'are', 'mellow', 'just', 'Kenny', 'guitar', 'bass', 'player', 'here', 'pianist', 'soft', 'drumming', 'nice', 'light', 'jazz', 'when', 'want', 'chill.It', 'nice', '.real', 'nice']",The Jazz Channel Presents Kenny Rankin

Gallagher,"[3, 3]","As a college professor, with a love of music of all kinds, and a proud owner of several Kenny Rankin discs - I hope to buy them all - I played a portion of this concert to one of my classes and then played his stunning, classic version of ""Blackbird"" to another class.  At this time, the Fall of 2009, I was not aware that Mr. Rankin, one of the best vocalists of the 20th (and 21st) Century had passed during the previous summer.  I just wanted to share his work to an intelligent, open-minded group of students in their late teens who had never heard of this man before.  They were both moved and impressed!  They sat still, though class was ending, as we watched  ad listened to ""Haven't We Met?"" in this very DVD - a MUST for anyone who is a Rankin fan if you never exeperienced him in concert, and even if you did - and I could tell they gladly would have stayed for more.  There is no one who sings like Kenny Rankin - one of his mentors, Laura Nyro, comes close, in her own beauty, passion and grace evident in Rankin's singing.  This DVD is from a Jazz Channel concert and, while by no means does it give you everything this man crafted with such care over the years, it certainly gives you the kind of modest, intimate concerts Mr. Rankin gave throughout the years, concerts that offered his great talent with the guitar (from the 1950's which he always used) and piano. And classics such as ""Peaceful"" and others.  I am so blessed to have seen him in December 2005, at Fairfield Theatre Co, CT, front row, where he played, sang, and offered amusing and tender insights to his life, career and family. He was a New Yorker, tough, but tender, and with a voice that Paul McCartney said delivered some of the best versions of the Beatles songs.  Please check out his live CD from the Bottom Line as well.  I write this with great honor - and incredible sadness - because I had hoped to see him perform again live soon.  I remember, at evening's end, in '05, there was Mr. Rankin, who had played for millions in his lifetime, sitting quietly alone at a table, offering his autograph and kind words to his audience.  His was a brilliant, beautiful, singular talent and this beautifully shot DVD does him every justice.  It is beyond ""5 stars"".  So was Mr. Rankin. So was the incredible, timeless music he created.",5,"A brilliant, beautiful voice of warmth, passion, and jazz",1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,2317,"['college', 'professor', 'love', 'music', 'kinds', 'proud', 'owner', 'several', 'Kenny', 'Rankin', 'discs', 'hope', 'buy', 'played', 'portion', 'concert', 'one', 'classes', 'then', 'played', 'stunning', 'classic', 'version', 'Blackbird', 'class', 'time', 'Fall', '2009', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'Mr.', 'Rankin', 'one', 'best', 'vocalists', '20th', '21st', 'Century', 'had', 'passed', 'previous', 'summer', 'just', 'wanted', 'share', 'work', 'intelligent', 'open-minded', 'group', 'students', 'late', 'teens', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'man', 'were', 'moved', 'impressed', 'sat', 'still', 'class', 'was', 'ending', 'watched', 'ad', 'listened', 'Have', ""n't"", 'Met', 'very', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'anyone', 'who', 'Rankin', 'fan', 'never', 'exeperienced', 'concert', 'even', 'did', 'could', 'tell', 'gladly', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'more', 'one', 'who', 'Kenny', 'Rankin', 'one', 'mentors', 'Laura', 'Nyro', 'close', 'own', 'beauty', 'passion', 'grace', 'evident', 'Rankin', 'singing', 'DVD', 'Jazz', 'Channel', 'concert', 'means', 'give', 'everything', 'man', 'crafted', 'such', 'care', 'years', 'certainly', 'kind', 'modest', 'intimate', 'concerts', 'Mr.', 'Rankin', 'gave', 'years', 'concerts', 'offered', 'great', 'talent', 'guitar', '1950', 'always', 'used', 'piano', 'classics', 'such', 'Peaceful', 'others', 'am', 'so', 'blessed', 'have', 'seen', 'December', '2005', 'Fairfield', 'Theatre', 'Co', 'CT', 'front', 'row', 'where', 'played', 'sang', 'offered', 'amusing', 'tender', 'insights', 'life', 'career', 'family', 'was', 'New', 'Yorker', 'tough', 'tender', 'voice', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'said', 'delivered', 'best', 'versions', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'Please', 'check', 'out', 'live', 'CD', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'well', 'write', 'great', 'honor', 'incredible', 'sadness', 'had', 'hoped', 'see', 'perform', 'again', 'live', 'soon', 'remember', 'evening', 'end', ""'05"", 'was', 'Mr.', 'Rankin', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'millions', 'lifetime', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'alone', 'table', 'offering', 'autograph', 'kind', 'words', 'audience', 'was', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'singular', 'talent', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'DVD', 'justice', '5', 'stars', 'So', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Rankin', 'So', 'was', 'incredible', 'timeless', 'music', 'created']",The Jazz Channel Presents Kenny Rankin

A master of reinterpretation with a voice that is flexible with an extraordinary range.  One of the most melliflous voices I've ever heard.  He has this way of taking almost any song and making it a Kenny Rankin song.  Over the years he's only gotten better.This DVD shows him with an outstanding small group and string section.  David Finck and Joe Beck are amazing on this recording on bass and guitar respectively.Kenny is at home in both the jazz, pop or popular standard genres.  He has a unique vision. He takes a song like ""More Than You Know"" and does it in a way in a whole new way accentuating notes and phrases with subtlety.This performance is fresh, vital and he does this music in a state of bliss, or so it comes across.  He also shows himself to be quite the guitar player.  Very good technique.You can't go wrong getting this.  This DVD is what good concerts are about.  A good solid group, extraordinary vocalist in an intimate setting with songs coming to life in that unique Kenny Rankin way.I also enjoyed the interview portion of this DVD, it was very well done.",5,A stellar performance by an amazing vocalist,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1178,"['Kenny', 'Rankin', 'one', 'truly', 'identifible', 'musicians', 'Two', 'notes', 'know', 'who', 'master', 'reinterpretation', 'voice', 'flexible', 'extraordinary', 'range', 'One', 'most', 'melliflous', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'way', 'taking', 'almost', 'song', 'making', 'Kenny', 'Rankin', 'song', 'years', 'only', 'gotten', 'better.This', 'DVD', 'outstanding', 'small', 'group', 'string', 'section', 'David', 'Finck', 'Joe', 'Beck', 'are', 'amazing', 'recording', 'bass', 'guitar', 'respectively.Kenny', 'home', 'jazz', 'pop', 'popular', 'standard', 'genres', 'unique', 'vision', 'song', 'More', 'Than', 'Know', 'way', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'accentuating', 'notes', 'phrases', 'subtlety.This', 'performance', 'fresh', 'vital', 'music', 'state', 'bliss', 'across', 'also', 'be', 'quite', 'guitar', 'player', 'Very', 'good', 'technique.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'getting', 'DVD', 'what', 'good', 'concerts', 'are', 'good', 'solid', 'group', 'extraordinary', 'vocalist', 'intimate', 'setting', 'songs', 'coming', 'life', 'unique', 'Kenny', 'Rankin', 'way.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'interview', 'portion', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done']",The Jazz Channel Presents Kenny Rankin
