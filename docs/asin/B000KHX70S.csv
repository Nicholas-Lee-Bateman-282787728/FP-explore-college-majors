1034223,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000KHX70S,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 10]","Picturesque and unbridled, THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG is Mongolian in the extreme. More of a stream of consciousness in terms of style, The Cave of the Yellow Dog's director, Byambasuren Davaa, gives us her second feature length film that has the look and feel of a wayward docudrama but gives us a story that materializes by happenstance (her first being the well-doneThe Story of the Weeping Camel).Watching the extra features on the DVD gives one the insights you'll need to understand Ms. Davaa's style of filming. No script. No actors. Just real people doing real lines ...for the most part. The only ""story"" that weaves its way in is that of the yellow dog and his cave, revealed by an old crone who lives near our Mongolian family's current location.The family is the Batchuluun family, a husband, wife, a mischievous (and very young) son, a young daughter, and another daughter -- the eldest -- Nansal. It is Nansal who we get to know best as she returns from school in ""the city"" to her family's nomadic grounds in mountainous western Mongolia. The panoramic shots of the surrounding countryside are achingly beautiful, with fiery sunsets, Grand Canyon-sized valleys, and hillocks of grazing lands mixed with flowering blooms. The topography is often more interesting than the story itself, which meanders hither and thither; from children playing ...to working the farm to finding a not-yellow dog in a nearby cave.The puppy that Nansal finds is the culmination of what should have been the film's central point. Her obsession over the dog and befriending it causes a rift between Nansal and her father, who doesn't want the dog to attract prowling packs of wolves to their homestead and their goat herd. Nansal loses interest in everything but the pup, even going so far as to not pay attention to the family herd and, eventually, to lose sight of her young brother whom she's supposed to be keeping an eye on. When Nansal stumbles upon an old lady living in a distant yurt, she learns the story of what can happen when someone finds a dog in a cave (although the old lady's story-dog was yellow and Nansal's is black and white ...and named Spot.) ... I won't say anymore, though, for fear of giving away what could be considered the ""plot.""Getting back to the extra features...Director Davaa all but admits that they really had no plan on what to film, just taking it day-by-day and letting the story unfold as it may. So what became an actual plot developed by accident, which I find a bit irritating and refreshing. What if the plot hadn't developed and all we'd gotten were glimpses into the life of a western Mongolian family? I can't help but think that this would've been disastrous for the film. But, thankfully, the story DID come through and we get something unique and pretty darned original.",3,A Western Mongolian Family With No Script...,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2814,"['Picturesque', 'unbridled', 'THE', 'CAVE', 'OF', 'THE', 'YELLOW', 'DOG', 'Mongolian', 'extreme', 'More', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'terms', 'style', 'Cave', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'director', 'Byambasuren', 'Davaa', 'second', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'wayward', 'docudrama', 'story', 'happenstance', 'first', 'being', 'well-doneThe', 'Story', 'Weeping', 'Camel', '.Watching', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'one', 'insights', ""'ll"", 'need', 'understand', 'Ms.', 'Davaa', 'style', 'filming', 'script', 'actors', 'Just', 'real', 'people', 'doing', 'real', 'lines', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'story', 'way', 'yellow', 'dog', 'cave', 'revealed', 'old', 'crone', 'who', 'Mongolian', 'family', 'current', 'location.The', 'family', 'Batchuluun', 'family', 'husband', 'wife', 'mischievous', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'young', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'eldest', 'Nansal', 'Nansal', 'who', 'get', 'know', 'best', 'school', 'city', 'family', 'nomadic', 'grounds', 'mountainous', 'western', 'Mongolia', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'surrounding', 'countryside', 'are', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'fiery', 'sunsets', 'Grand', 'Canyon-sized', 'valleys', 'hillocks', 'grazing', 'lands', 'mixed', 'flowering', 'blooms', 'topography', 'often', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'hither', 'thither', 'children', 'playing', 'working', 'farm', 'finding', 'not-yellow', 'dog', 'nearby', 'cave.The', 'puppy', 'Nansal', 'culmination', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'central', 'point', 'obsession', 'dog', 'befriending', 'rift', 'Nansal', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'dog', 'attract', 'prowling', 'packs', 'wolves', 'homestead', 'goat', 'herd', 'interest', 'everything', 'pup', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'family', 'herd', 'eventually', 'lose', 'sight', 'young', 'brother', 'whom', 'supposed', 'be', 'keeping', 'eye', 'When', 'Nansal', 'old', 'lady', 'living', 'distant', 'yurt', 'story', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'someone', 'dog', 'cave', 'old', 'lady', 'story-dog', 'was', 'yellow', 'Nansal', 'black', 'white', 'named', 'Spot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'though', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'plot', 'Getting', 'back', 'extra', 'features', 'Director', 'Davaa', 'admits', 'really', 'had', 'plan', 'what', 'film', 'just', 'taking', 'day-by-day', 'letting', 'story', 'unfold', 'may', 'So', 'what', 'became', 'actual', 'plot', 'developed', 'accident', 'find', 'bit', 'irritating', 'refreshing', 'What', 'plot', 'had', ""n't"", 'developed', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'were', 'glimpses', 'life', 'western', 'Mongolian', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disastrous', 'film', 'thankfully', 'story', 'DID', 'come', 'get', 'something', 'unique', 'pretty', 'darned', 'original']",The Cave of the Yellow Dog
1034224,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000KHX70S,Brian E. Erland,"[44, 44]","Note: Mongolian with English and Spanish subtitles [also contains optional English dubbed version].`The Cave of the Yellow Dog"" released in '05 is a remarkably unique and fascinating journey into the landscape and soulscape of a real life Mongolian family. Join Nansal and her younger sister, little brother and parents on their neverending nomadic journey as the quide their flock of sheep from one grazing field to the next.The film chronicles the daily activities of a solitary nomadic family trying to survive the elements, packs of wolves and vultures while trying to raise three small children.  The story centers on the oldest child, Nansal. Nansal is approximately eight or nine years and lives with relatives in the city most of the year so she can attend school. Now that summer has arrived she has returned to her family where she resumes her old way of life. She helps with the sheep, collects dung and watches over her younger siblings. On one dung collecting expedition she finds a dog and forms an immediate bond with the animal. She names her new playmate Konchar and brings him home. Her parents reaction to their new guest is mixed and the question arises; is the dog a hindrance that will attract wolves into their camp, or was it sent by fate for some undisclosed purpose. It is here that the concept of reincarnation delicately weaves its thread through the storyline. Will stubborn little Nansal be able to convince her parents that the arrival of the dog is a good thing or will she have to abandon her new friend when it's time to move on?The affectionate nature of this delightful family exudes onto the screen as the two adoring parents continue living a life style that is fast growing extinct. The story is enchanting, the three children adorable and the Mongolian landscape magnificent. Whether approached as documentary, travel log, family faire, intelligent drama, or spiritual teaching, the film works well within all the fore mentioned categories. `The Cave of the Yellow Dog' also possesses a simple but elegant soundtrack reminiscent of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is a remarkable cinematic achievement and a moving, unforgettable experience that so clearly points out that even in so vastly different cultures and lifestyles how alike we truly are.",5,"""You Can't Play With Buddha"" ~ Herding Ship And Collecting Dung Along The Endless Cycle Of Reincarnation",1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2292,"['Note', 'Mongolian', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', '[', 'also', 'optional', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', ']', 'Cave', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'released', ""'05"", 'remarkably', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'landscape', 'soulscape', 'real', 'life', 'Mongolian', 'family', 'Join', 'Nansal', 'younger', 'sister', 'little', 'brother', 'parents', 'neverending', 'nomadic', 'journey', 'quide', 'flock', 'sheep', 'one', 'grazing', 'field', 'next.The', 'film', 'daily', 'activities', 'solitary', 'nomadic', 'family', 'trying', 'survive', 'elements', 'packs', 'wolves', 'vultures', 'trying', 'raise', 'three', 'small', 'children', 'story', 'centers', 'oldest', 'child', 'Nansal', 'Nansal', 'approximately', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'relatives', 'city', 'most', 'year', 'can', 'attend', 'school', 'Now', 'summer', 'arrived', 'returned', 'family', 'where', 'old', 'way', 'life', 'sheep', 'dung', 'watches', 'younger', 'siblings', 'one', 'dung', 'collecting', 'expedition', 'dog', 'forms', 'immediate', 'bond', 'animal', 'new', 'playmate', 'Konchar', 'home', 'parents', 'reaction', 'new', 'guest', 'mixed', 'question', 'dog', 'hindrance', 'will', 'attract', 'wolves', 'camp', 'was', 'sent', 'fate', 'undisclosed', 'purpose', 'here', 'concept', 'reincarnation', 'delicately', 'thread', 'storyline', 'Will', 'stubborn', 'little', 'Nansal', 'be', 'able', 'convince', 'parents', 'arrival', 'dog', 'good', 'thing', 'will', 'have', 'abandon', 'new', 'friend', 'when', 'time', 'move', 'affectionate', 'nature', 'delightful', 'family', 'exudes', 'screen', 'two', 'adoring', 'parents', 'continue', 'living', 'life', 'style', 'fast', 'growing', 'extinct', 'story', 'enchanting', 'three', 'children', 'adorable', 'Mongolian', 'landscape', 'magnificent', 'Whether', 'approached', 'documentary', 'travel', 'log', 'family', 'faire', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'spiritual', 'teaching', 'film', 'well', 'fore', 'mentioned', 'categories', 'Cave', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'also', 'simple', 'elegant', 'soundtrack', 'reminiscent', ""'Crouching"", 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'remarkable', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'moving', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'so', 'clearly', 'points', 'out', 'even', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'cultures', 'how', 'truly', 'are']",The Cave of the Yellow Dog

1034226,AAPA4KQWA7UXN,B000KHX70S,cvairag,"[3, 3]","first - i wish to express my utter disagreement with reviewers who call this ""unprofessional"" film-making - what we have here is not merely professional - it's cinematic genius - when i compare a film of such power and elegance in story telling, as layered with sub-text as crucial to the advancement of our understanding as The Cave of the Yellow Dog is - with the c**p that is regularly churned out of Hollywood on bloated mispent budgets, not for art, but to gouge a profit - one must, I say must, simply cringe once again at the excesses of American society.Lao-tzu, the venerable icon of Taoism, said that he wanted to get rid the Confucian ideal of jen, or rationally derived ""fellow feeling"" or ""empathy"", in order that we could begin to love again.  What he meant by love was what the ancient Chinese, and be assured the Mong people were at one with them in at least this much, called ""the great sympathy"" or the primordial interfusion that undergirds the basis of our integrity as sentient beings.The search for primordial love, within the hard barriers manifested by the inviolate limitations of life is what the film tries to recover for us.  That search is mandatory.  Our intuitive nature, our inner hunger for love, drives us to it.The complexities which emerge in this film, easily one of the greatest of the young century thus far, are far too rich to be dealt with in what is appropriate for a review.  But, let me confess, I am no dog lover.

Last year we met a woman from Mongolia through a friend.  People from other countries love it when you ask about their culture, and I talked with her for hours one Saturday afternoon.  Then we invited her to cook for us.  She also brought some pictures.  One of the pictures was of herself as a child, and I was just haunted by her eyes; such beautiful eyes with a touch of pride.  So that re-tweeked my interest in Mongolia so I got this movie.One of the intentions of the director was to display this culture and the land.  The landscape shots are breathtaking and capture the mood of the terrain like the movie ""Blue Crush"" captured the beauty of the Hawaiian surf.  Also there are displays of the lifestyle, the food, the housing, the education, and family structure.  One gets a peek at this culture.  One of the things that struck me was the eyes of the little girl were exactly like my friend's eyes in the picture.  The little girl has the cutest little face.  Who doesn't like cute little girls?

Eyon ""Little Raven""","[21, 23]","While not as original asThe Story of the Weeping Camel, YELLOW DOG is still a visually beautiful film set in Western Mongolia (not in the Gobi of WEEPING CAMEL). Once again, it's a fascinating peek at a real-life Mongolian couple living in a yurt with their 3 children, including a daughter home from school who finds a stray dog. And, it's the documentarian glimpse at the family's life that entrances me.The sense of artificial drama is stronger here than in WEEPING CAMEL. In fact, the found dog and little girl rings of Disney. And that feeling becomes even stronger when she is drawn into dire situations by her fondness for him. (At least the girl, Nansal Batchuluun, is a thousand times more appealing than the insufferable Kevin Corcoran.)

The BD and DVD on this set are virtually identical and contain the same faults.

On both discs the focus and color is not as good as one would expect and frequently throughout the film there is a lot of mild movement jerking. A good example is around the 22 minute mark when the father sets off on his motorbike to sell some skins. As the camera pans across the herd there is a lot of jerkiness that does not appear on my other DVD and overall I find this DVD sharper and without any obvious fault.

The basic story is very simple: whether the father of Nansai, the eldest daughter and protagonist, will allow her to keep Zochor (Mongolian for ""Spot""), the little dog she finds in a cave. Nansai and Zochor, as Hitchcock might tell you, are the McGuffins; the real story is how the Batchuluuns live in a yurt on the treeless steppes of western Mongolia, tending their sheep, and moving as the weather and the availability of grass and water dictate. Davaa lovingly records the details of the Batchuluuns' life, as they ride shaggy ponies to lead the flocks to grass (Mr. Batchuluun has a motorcycle when he needs to get somewhere in a hurry) and gather dried dung for fires to smoke the meat they need to survive.Aided greatly by the magnificent camerawork of photographer Daniel Schoenauer--who is equally effective in recording the endless, ever-changing skies above Mongolia and the exquisitely colorful fabrics that decorate the interior of the Batchuluuns' yurt--Davaa presents a quietly compelling portrait of a dying way of life. Nansai spends most of the year in school in Ulan Bator, coming home only for summer vacations, and her little sister and brother will soon follow. Her parents talk about how they might be forced someday to move to the city and get jobs there. Meanwhile, Davaa captures exquisite moments in the Batchuluuns' life. When baby brother plays with the family's porcelain figure of Buddha, his sister upbraids him: ""You can't play with God!"" As Davaa says in a German-language interview that's an extra on this disc, you can't script a moment like that.While this in many ways is an ideal film for the whole family, I fear that its slow pace would bore many children, though they certainly would identify with Nansai, the scrapes she gets into, and her love for her family and her little dog. The real audience for ""Cave of the Yellow Dog"" is for contemplative adults who appreciate pictorial beauty, an exotic and endangered way of life, and the universal appeal of a family whose members love and support each other. The final image of the Batchuluuns moving their herd to new pastures, as a truck drives by blaring a reminder to vote in the next election, is one you won't soon forget.",5,Simple and beautiful.,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,2556,"['Cave', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'amazing', 'simplicity', 'beauty', 'perfect', 'example', 'Neo-Realism', 'such', 'even', 'Vittorio', 'Sica', 'never', 'achieved', 'director', 'Byambasuren', 'Davaa', 'persuaded', 'actual', 'nomadic', 'Mongolian', 'family', 'Batchuluuns', 'star', 'film', 'essentially', 'was', 'improvised', 'details', 'daily', 'lives', 'basic', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'father', 'Nansai', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'protagonist', 'will', 'allow', 'keep', 'Zochor', 'Mongolian', 'Spot', 'little', 'dog', 'cave', 'Nansai', 'Zochor', 'Hitchcock', 'might', 'tell', 'are', 'McGuffins', 'real', 'story', 'how', 'Batchuluuns', 'live', 'yurt', 'treeless', 'steppes', 'western', 'Mongolia', 'tending', 'sheep', 'moving', 'weather', 'availability', 'grass', 'water', 'dictate', 'Davaa', 'lovingly', 'details', 'Batchuluuns', 'life', 'ride', 'shaggy', 'ponies', 'lead', 'flocks', 'grass', 'Mr.', 'Batchuluun', 'motorcycle', 'when', 'get', 'somewhere', 'hurry', 'dried', 'dung', 'fires', 'smoke', 'meat', 'need', 'survive.Aided', 'greatly', 'magnificent', 'camerawork', 'photographer', 'Daniel', 'Schoenauer', 'who', 'equally', 'effective', 'recording', 'endless', 'ever-changing', 'skies', 'Mongolia', 'exquisitely', 'colorful', 'fabrics', 'decorate', 'interior', 'Batchuluuns', 'yurt', 'Davaa', 'quietly', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'dying', 'way', 'life', 'Nansai', 'most', 'year', 'school', 'Ulan', 'Bator', 'coming', 'home', 'only', 'summer', 'vacations', 'little', 'sister', 'brother', 'will', 'soon', 'follow', 'parents', 'talk', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'forced', 'someday', 'move', 'city', 'get', 'jobs', 'there', 'Meanwhile', 'Davaa', 'exquisite', 'moments', 'Batchuluuns', 'life', 'When', 'baby', 'brother', 'family', 'porcelain', 'figure', 'Buddha', 'sister', 'upbraids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'God', 'Davaa', 'German-language', 'interview', 'extra', 'disc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'script', 'moment', 'that.While', 'many', 'ways', 'ideal', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'fear', 'slow', 'pace', 'would', 'bore', 'many', 'children', 'certainly', 'would', 'identify', 'Nansai', 'scrapes', 'love', 'family', 'little', 'dog', 'real', 'audience', 'Cave', 'Yellow', 'Dog', 'contemplative', 'adults', 'who', 'appreciate', 'pictorial', 'beauty', 'exotic', 'endangered', 'way', 'life', 'universal', 'appeal', 'family', 'members', 'love', 'support', 'other', 'final', 'image', 'Batchuluuns', 'moving', 'herd', 'new', 'pastures', 'truck', 'drives', 'blaring', 'reminder', 'vote', 'next', 'election', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",The Cave of the Yellow Dog

It is hard to comprehend how the movie can be so compelling while being so straight forward. I like the scene when the husband returned home from a long journey to the city to sell off their sheep skin. With part of that money, he bought his wife a plastic laddle of bright green color and his wife received it as if it was a diamond ring. Beyond this movie, it makes me wonder what influences modern day city life have on these last vestiges of nomads. The parents already sent the older daughter to school in the city and more and more conveniences are introduced to their daily life.

The people wear brightly colored silk robes with contrasting sashes and flowers and ribbons in their hair while doing their ordinary tasks like collecting dung.  What a nice way to live! When they move on to another location, they perform a ritual thanking the area for allowing them to spend the season there! Mostly the beauty of the family is a treat to watch.  After decades of movies about sick, dysfunctional families, what a treat to see a family that lives so harmoniously.  Their love is not sentimental but expresses itself in the most natural, practical ways.  Maybe it's the fresh air, uncomplicated lifestyle or the fresh yak milk, but these people are even physically splendid.  It is a real family, too!  I usually cringe at ""cute"" child actors, especially, the recent batch of ""so-homely-they're-adorable"" kids we've been subject to. (argh) These are the real thing... beautiful, natural, children, with some of the rosiest cheeks you'll ever see! Just watching them wriggle in bed is a treat!  There's not a tense bone in these kids.The plot is simple---just enough story to give us some reason for enjoying the delightful scenes of everyday life in this remarkable culture.  The shots are gorgeous---I loved watching the dismantling of the yurt.  The overhead view of the structure of the roof reminded me of the best of ""modern art."" I disagree with the reviewer who complained that this was Disneyesque.  On the contrary, it is the freedom from Hollywood conventions that makes this film worth seeing.When I saw this, the audience seemed really into it...lots of spontaneous laughing and comments and people applauded at the end.

To appreciate it fully, one needs the DVD, for the interview with the director, a Mongolian woman who studied film making in Germany.  The movie is partly documentary insofar as the actors are, not professional actors, but people playing themselves in a simple plot.  You can choose either Spanish or English captions for the Mongolian dialog.  Unfortunately, the interview in German has captions only in English.I have not noticed that other customer reviews mentioned the music, and somebody should.  It is very good, whether typically Mongolian or not, making the movie many times more enjoyable and also more meaningful.The title seems misleading.  The shallow cave is seen only briefly.  The dog is there only temporarily.  He is not yellow, but white and black, as you can see from the DVD cover.  The dog does not really have a large role, except maybe as a plot gimmick.
