The story follows two brothers, Sam  and Dean Winchester (Jared Padalecki of Gilmore Girls fame and Jensen Ackles of DeVour) as they make their way  cross-country searching for their missing father who has blazed a trail of  vengence killings against monstrous terrors in search of what killed his wife and the mother of his two sons years before. Dean, the older brother, has issues with Sam (Padalecki) who has gone on with his life while he helped Dad go on a demon hunting spree. When Dad ends up missing,  Dean tracks down Sam  in hopes he will help track down Dad. Sam  reluctantly takes out time from school  for a short time but when his girlfriend, Jess,  ends up killed in the same fashion as Mom, Sam is soon hot on the trail also. Each of the first seasons 22 episodes follows the  brothers encounters with strange beings from urban legends and various otherworldly creatures. Filled with laughs and genuine shocker scares, this show takes on the genre where Buffy left off, comfortably  filling  the void with great stories,  good performances and loads of  horror/fantasy fun!

993593,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B000FP2OPY,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[0, 0]","The funny thing about this show is that I really wasn't into it the first time I watched it. At the time, it didn't feel like there was a bigger back story. It just felt like the standard fantasy procedural where the characters go out, investigate some strange incident, and solve the problem by fighting some demon or another. I'm not sure why that bothered me, since there are so many shows like this and I actually enjoy most of them. Which might be why I decided to give it another try.I have now watched the entire show to date and I'm glad I did. It turns out, there definitely was a bigger story going on-yellow eyes, Sam's demonic abilities, Dean's role in the apocalypse, oh right...and the apocalypse. It turns out that what I like most about the series is, in fact, those very things that I thought the show was missing. Where some fantasy shows struggle to build from one season to the next-how bad can things get after all?-this show has done an excellent job of making on season impact the next one so that to every action there is a bigger reaction coming. (See the end of this season, where we meet God, sort of.)Supernatural follows Sam and Dean, two brothers who have grown up, raised by their father in the rough world of demon hunting after their mother is killed by a demon with yellow eyes. Sam attempts to leave this life to go to college, only to be pulled back in when his girlfriend is killed the same way.The show has struggled over the years to add in a few more characters. In came:Ruby, a demon who seems to be on the side of goodBobby Singer, a fellow hunter and father figure in the boys' livesEllen and Jo- Ellen is a saloon owner who is constantly in contact with hunters and Jo who becomes a hunterBela, a self-centered thiefCastiel, an arch-angel who becomes an allyAnna, a fallen angel who eventually gains her wings againThese are some of the bigger characters who have come into the story at some point or another. Bobby's introduction originally felt forced and abrupt but he has since better integrated into the show and now feels like a good fit. The need for important characters also comes from a lack of tension-there is no chance that the brothers can be killed off so we have to care about others who might be killed.One of the big issues about the show is that we have essentially seen that death is not really ever permanent. There are a myriad of ways in which a person might be resurrected. Because of this, we can never really be sad when someone dies and the fear that we might lose someone is never really there. This, in my opinion, is one of the primary issues with sci-fi and fantasy in general (think about Stargate SG-1 where Daniel dies every few episodes). It lowers the stakes of any problems happening. Despite this problem, the show has managed to make things build up from season to season. Even now, when you start wondering how we could have gotten bigger than the coming of Lucifer, we learn that there can be bigger problems.There is also a general lack of female characters (which is where Bela and Ruby came in). It would be nice to have a bit more female energy on the show. The writers seem to be struggling with this. They are never really satisfied with their female characters and therefore none have stayed so far. I'm hoping they manage this eventually (I liked Jo, Ruby, and Anna personally but supposedly other viewers did not). I am hoping they will find and stick to one or two, perhaps someone who is equal to the brothers and not someone who needs protecting (like Dean's most recent love interest).Castiel wound up being one of the most interesting characters on the show, as we watched him grow from an unquestioning angel to someone who has come to question, think, and act of his own volition. interestingly, this is what leads to the issue of the coming season. The brothers are often self-centered and it is this lack of paying attention to others that ultimately leads to Castiel's wild behavior.I like how far the show's mythology has gone and I am curious to see where they plan to take things. At the same time, it does feel like the show is winding down. I am not sure how much longer it can run.",4,Stronger Than Expected,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,4191,"['funny', 'thing', 'show', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'bigger', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'felt', 'standard', 'fantasy', 'procedural', 'where', 'characters', 'go', 'out', 'investigate', 'strange', 'incident', 'solve', 'problem', 'fighting', 'demon', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'bothered', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'most', 'Which', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'try.I', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'entire', 'show', 'date', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'out', 'definitely', 'was', 'bigger', 'story', 'going', 'on-yellow', 'eyes', 'Sam', 'demonic', 'abilities', 'Dean', 'role', 'apocalypse', 'oh', 'right', 'apocalypse', 'out', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'series', 'fact', 'very', 'things', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'missing', 'Where', 'fantasy', 'struggle', 'build', 'one', 'season', 'next-how', 'bad', 'can', 'things', 'get', '-this', 'show', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'season', 'impact', 'next', 'one', 'so', 'action', 'bigger', 'reaction', 'coming', 'See', 'end', 'season', 'where', 'meet', 'God', 'sort', 'Supernatural', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'raised', 'father', 'rough', 'world', 'demon', 'hunting', 'mother', 'killed', 'demon', 'yellow', 'eyes', 'Sam', 'leave', 'life', 'go', 'college', 'only', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'killed', 'same', 'way.The', 'show', 'struggled', 'years', 'add', 'few', 'more', 'characters', 'came', 'Ruby', 'demon', 'who', 'be', 'side', 'goodBobby', 'Singer', 'fellow', 'hunter', 'father', 'figure', 'boys', 'livesEllen', 'Jo-', 'Ellen', 'saloon', 'owner', 'who', 'constantly', 'contact', 'hunters', 'Jo', 'who', 'hunterBela', 'self-centered', 'thiefCastiel', 'arch-angel', 'who', 'allyAnna', 'fallen', 'angel', 'who', 'eventually', 'gains', 'wings', 'againThese', 'are', 'bigger', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'story', 'point', 'Bobby', 'introduction', 'originally', 'felt', 'forced', 'abrupt', 'better', 'integrated', 'show', 'now', 'feels', 'good', 'fit', 'need', 'important', 'characters', 'also', 'lack', 'tension-there', 'chance', 'brothers', 'can', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'have', 'care', 'others', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'killed.One', 'big', 'issues', 'show', 'have', 'essentially', 'seen', 'death', 'not', 'really', 'ever', 'permanent', 'are', 'myriad', 'ways', 'person', 'might', 'be', 'resurrected', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'sad', 'when', 'someone', 'fear', 'might', 'lose', 'someone', 'never', 'really', 'there', 'opinion', 'one', 'primary', 'issues', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'general', 'think', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'where', 'Daniel', 'few', 'episodes', 'stakes', 'problems', 'happening', 'problem', 'show', 'managed', 'make', 'things', 'build', 'up', 'season', 'season', 'Even', 'now', 'when', 'start', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'bigger', 'coming', 'Lucifer', 'learn', 'can', 'be', 'bigger', 'problems.There', 'also', 'general', 'lack', 'female', 'characters', 'where', 'Bela', 'Ruby', 'came', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'female', 'energy', 'show', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'struggling', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'satisfied', 'female', 'characters', 'therefore', 'none', 'have', 'stayed', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'manage', 'eventually', 'liked', 'Jo', 'Ruby', 'Anna', 'personally', 'supposedly', 'other', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'am', 'hoping', 'will', 'find', 'stick', 'one', 'two', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'equal', 'brothers', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'protecting', 'Dean', 'most', 'recent', 'love', 'interest', '.Castiel', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'show', 'watched', 'grow', 'unquestioning', 'angel', 'someone', 'who', 'come', 'question', 'think', 'act', 'own', 'volition', 'interestingly', 'what', 'issue', 'coming', 'season', 'brothers', 'are', 'often', 'self-centered', 'lack', 'paying', 'attention', 'others', 'ultimately', 'Castiel', 'wild', 'behavior.I', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'mythology', 'gone', 'am', 'curious', 'see', 'where', 'plan', 'take', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'show', 'winding', 'down', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'run']",N/A
993594,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000FP2OPY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[42, 46]","Described as ""The X Files Meets Route 66"", Supernatural came along last fall on the WB and quickly became the one bright spot for new programming. Feeling the withdrawl of no more ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"", this new show helps fill in that void, if not totally making up for it. Better than expected for this type of show on a network like WB, Supernatural is a tight and well shot show that is a little ""mini horror movie"" every week, but having it's own mythology and season story arc. The show's weekly stories delve into folklore and famous urban legends. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki play Dean and Sam Winchester, brothers who drive across the country tracking down supernatural happening and beings and helping people. They have their own personal motives that drive them that include horrible tragedies that have happened to them both and their family. Like Mulder who is searching for his sister, the boys are searching for their father. ""Pilot"" is an exceptionally well done first episode that sets everything up very nicely. Other top highlights featured in the debut season include ""Bloody Mary"", where the brothers confront that famous legend about a ghostly apparition in mirrors. ""Hook Man"" puts a new and modern spin on the 'ol crazy killer with a hook hand at lovers lane tale and pulls it off. Ackles gets to show off his acting chops in the shape shifting episode ""Skin"". The boys' tragic past comes back to haunt them in the exceptional ""Home"", one of the first season's best episodes. ""Asylum"" is one of the top best as the brothers try to explore strange things going on in an abandoned asylum. ""Scarecrow"" is a wonderful little thrill ride about strange cititzens and their ties to a murderous scarecrow. Buffy's Julie Benz(Darla)appears in ""Faith"". Another alum of the Joss Whedon universe, Angel's Amy Acker, appears in ""Dead In The Water"". ""Hell House"" is a lot of fun and has a funny reference to Buffy, and vampires themselves pop up in ""Dead Man's Blood"". The two brothers are the only regulars on the show, and they carry the series very nicely. Ackles is the real star of the show. His Dean character is complex with a great sense of humor and cockiness. Padalecki's Sam is a little more dour who barely cracks a smile. The show's look is sometimes light, but a lot of the time dark and gritty. It's tone is just right, and it's production values are top notch. One of the best aspects of the show is it's kickin' classic rock soundtrack. What's not to love?. Well, ""Bugs"" for one, but that's about it. Supernatural is a richly layered and conceived series that could have a long and successful run. The writing is wonderful, the ideas are fresh and inventive, and the two leads can carry the show without any other regulars. The brother relationship is strong at times and fragile the next.

993597,A1806QLIG0NXHR,B000FP2OPY,"B. L. Ruiz ""book devourer""","[17, 19]","Eric Kripke has learned from the masters, most especially Joss Whedon. He keeps just enough humor in the show to keep you guessing when the scares will come and just enough truly scary, creepy moments to make you jump.Additionally, he's brought in Kim Manners, McG, David Nutter, John Shiban (and newly added Ben Edlund!) as well as some amazingly talented (and underrated) actors in Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.People initially panned this show, thinking that two actors as relatively unknown as Jensen Ackles (Smallville and Dark Angel) and Jared Padalecki (House of Wax and Gilmore Girls) could not possibly carry the weight of an entire series, simply because they would be the only two recurring characters in every episode.They've surprised everyone. The chemistry and interaction between these two is incredible! They are believable as brothers and as hunters. Jensen Ackles has taken the character of Dean Winchester, a devil-may-care leather-jacketed gun-toting demon hunter and lifted it from the potential stereotype into a truly multi-dimensional character. Jared Padalecki can at times be a bit more uneven in his characterization, but he comes into his own toward the end of the season and plays well off his co-star.Add to the mix Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Grey's Anatomy and Weeds) as their father and the three of them keep you glued to the screen. The tension literally jumps off the screen when the three of them work together.Basic Premise:John Winchester (Morgan) witnessed his wife's death at the hands of a demon 22 years ago. Since then, he's become obsessed with hunting down and killing the thing that took his Mary from him.Dean Winchester (Ackles) was 4 at the time, and carried his baby brother, Sam, from the house at his father's behest. Since then, he has been the glue that held their family together. Hunter, protector and sometimes referee.Sam Winchester (Padalecki) left the family to pursue a normal life at Stanford - a life that is interrupted in the pilot in a brutal on-screen way, driving him back into his family's drifting, hunting lifestyle.Spooky, dark, funny, and angsty - this show is the real ""MUST SEE TV""!",5,One of the Best in Years!,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,2157,"['Eric', 'Kripke', 'learned', 'masters', 'most', 'especially', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'show', 'keep', 'guessing', 'when', 'scares', 'will', 'come', 'just', 'enough', 'truly', 'scary', 'creepy', 'moments', 'make', 'jump.Additionally', 'brought', 'Kim', 'Manners', 'McG', 'David', 'Nutter', 'John', 'Shiban', 'newly', 'added', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'as', 'well', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'underrated', 'actors', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Jared', 'Padalecki.People', 'initially', 'panned', 'show', 'thinking', 'two', 'actors', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Smallville', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'House', 'Wax', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'carry', 'weight', 'entire', 'series', 'simply', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'two', 'recurring', 'characters', 'episode.They', ""'ve"", 'surprised', 'everyone', 'chemistry', 'interaction', 'two', 'incredible', 'are', 'believable', 'brothers', 'hunters', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'taken', 'character', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'devil-may-care', 'leather-jacketed', 'gun-toting', 'demon', 'hunter', 'lifted', 'potential', 'stereotype', 'truly', 'multi-dimensional', 'character', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'uneven', 'characterization', 'own', 'end', 'season', 'plays', 'well', 'co-star.Add', 'mix', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Weeds', 'father', 'three', 'keep', 'glued', 'screen', 'tension', 'literally', 'screen', 'when', 'three', 'work', 'together.Basic', 'Premise', 'John', 'Winchester', 'Morgan', 'witnessed', 'wife', 'death', 'hands', 'demon', '22', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'become', 'obsessed', 'hunting', 'down', 'killing', 'thing', 'took', 'Mary', 'him.Dean', 'Winchester', 'Ackles', 'was', '4', 'time', 'carried', 'baby', 'brother', 'Sam', 'house', 'father', 'behest', 'then', 'been', 'glue', 'held', 'family', 'together', 'Hunter', 'protector', 'sometimes', 'referee.Sam', 'Winchester', 'Padalecki', 'left', 'family', 'pursue', 'normal', 'life', 'Stanford', 'life', 'interrupted', 'pilot', 'brutal', 'on-screen', 'way', 'driving', 'back', 'family', 'drifting', 'hunting', 'lifestyle.Spooky', 'dark', 'funny', 'angsty', 'show', 'real', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'TV']",N/A
993598,AN6Y4IYXXDNVV,B000FP2OPY,Bob02,"[1, 1]","This review is written by a totally blind consumer, so don't expect much pertaining to DVD picture quality.  I'm more interested in story.  So if you're still interested, read ahead by all means.I jumped on the Supernatural bandwagon when season 4 premiered, so I didn't get to see season 1 until I bought the first 4 seasons on dvd in anticipation of s5's release.  I have to say for a first season, I was very impressed.  I'm a sucker for all things related to horror and the premise of this show is just so bloody addictive.You're introduced to this happy family in the first scene and you're thinking,""Ok, so what could happen here?""  Evil supernatural force breaks into the house, kills mommy, and sends dad and sons running for their lives. And this is only the teaser of the very first episode!  Dad trains sons to become hunters of all ghoulies, ghosties, and long leggedy beasties, and things that go bump in the night. They spend the first season looking for whatever killed mommy aka Mary Winchester.  If I had seen this masterpiece of a series from episode one, I would have been hooked along with all the other viewers.  Well, I was from s4 episode 1 but that's a review for another day.All that to say that this series is extremely addictive and if you've never seen it but have been meaning to pick this first season up, you won't regret it.  Now I'm not much for series with a multitude of one shot episodes.  I enjoy things a bit more serialized, but this show starts delivering more continuity after the first 8 or so episodes.  The viewer is usually left speculating what is going to happen next even if the episode is one of those featuring a monster/vengeful spirit of the week rather than addressing the overall story arc of the season.This series is allot of fun to watch after dark.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Sure blind people get jittery at night when watching shows like this.  At least I do.  But that's part of the fun, in my opinion anyway.  And you gotta love the writing this season as well.(Eric Kripke is a genius.)  Don't get me started concerning the talented Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles who portray hunters Sam and Dean Winchester.  And let's not forget Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays John, their tough as nails father.  We're also introduced to Bobby Singer, portrayed by the incredible Jim Beaver, at the end of season 1. Singer is a fellow hunter as well as a friend of the Winchester family.  Bobby ties with Sam and Dean in terms of favorite characters.  I could write pages upon pages pertaining to how much I enjoy both characters and actors, but don't have the time.Recurring villains, you ask?  Oh yes indeed, there are.  That's another one of the things I love about this show.  Baddies aren't dispensed with and never return in this show.  Well, sometimes they are.  But you never know which villain you'll see popping up again later on down the line.  I love a good series which isn't so cut and dried.  And I really can't stand it when episodes are all wrapped up at the end with nice little bows on said packages. Hence why I love Supernatural so much.  Always leaves you wanting more, and it delivers.So if you like scary/suspenseful action packed edge of your seat types of series with a continuous story arc spanning season after season, pick up season 1 and give this series a go.  I will warn you though that season 1 ends on a tremendous cliffhanger.  My word, how did fans endure the wait between seasons?  I don't think I could have done that.  Anywho, you probably won't stop after season 1 if this is your first viewing, so have a blast and happy hunting, folks. Long live the Winchesters!

993601,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B000FP2OPY,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","The premise of this show is not bad. Two brothers whose job it is to hunt supernatural demons, ghosts, spirits, etc.. Each episode has a new incident and a new mystery to solve. The writers are fairly creative in coming up with new monsters to kill each week. The show mixes mystery and suspense which I like. I do not like shows that rely solely on suspense to keep the audience entertained (""How are they going to get out of this?""). I like there to be some mystery (""What is really going on here?"") otherwise I tend to get bored. Before they kill the demons or ghosts, Dean and Sam usually have to figure out what is actually going on, and having that mystery helps keep me interested.There are two other quick things I want to praise about the show before offering a few complaints. First, the production values are quite good. The special effects are all well done. Bad production values on a show about the supernatural can really pull you out of the show, but I have never been pulled out of this show by the thought ""That looked stupid"". Second, the show creates a good atmosphere. The color palette is very dark and grey. The hunters tend to be grizzled and unshaven (including Dean and Sam's father). I have to give the show credit for capturing what I think is the appropriate atmosphere for a show about demon hunting.However, the writing leaves a lot to be desired in a number of important respects. First, the fact that the show is about demons and ghosts and other supernatural creatures gives the writers a lot of free rein to just invent their way out of problems. It is like the writers write themselves into corners (""How are Dean and Sam going to get out of this one?"") and then just invent some ""fact"" about the demon or ghost they are fighting to get them out (""I know, what if the demon they are fighting is killed by light, etc.""). The solution often seems very contrived and invented for a very specific purpose (to get Dean and Sam out of a bind).Second, the characters are sort of boring. Dean and Sam are the typical, archetypal brothers. The extroverted man of action, who loves fast cars, and never questions authority (Dean), and the introverted intellectual, who reads books, and is constantly questioning authority (Sam). There is nothing wrong with those archetypes. They have been used for centuries to great effect. The problem is, the characters never really get beyond the familiar tropes, and achieve the status of genuine individuality. Think, for example, about how interesting Fox Mulder was as a character, and compare that to the characters in this show. I do not think this show holds up well under the comparison.The characters lack depth and complexity. Sam and Dean are both way too noble. They lack moral complexity. They are constantly beating themselves up for making honest mistakes, for failing to save someone through no fault of their own (""I should have been able to save her!""). They are always more than willing to die (literally) to save others. These are admirable qualities, but it would be nice to see a few genuine faults, and some genuine moral complexity. I get tired of watching perfect characters berate themselves about the outcome of some event that was totally out of their control. As if their inability to predict the future, or perfectly control the course of the world, were a moral failing.Third, a lot of the drama of the show is extremely repetitive and sentimental. Dean and Sam have the same argument over and over and over. In virtually every episode Dean and Sam get into the same argument about their father, or about Sam wanting to lead his own life etc., and then it gets resolved in a very sentimental way. I get annoyed with shows like this because things never progress. The argument never gets anywhere. They reach some new understanding at the end of an episode (Sam realizes he was being too hard on his father, Dean admits that he admires his brothers independence, etc.), but then the next episode they are right back where they started, having the same exact argument. The arguments between Dean and Sam are probably the most tiresome part of the show, and they get worse in the second season.Fourth, there is a familiar trope that is used a lot in this show: the hero (usually Dean) and the villain (usually a demon in the form of a beautiful woman) meet face to face and engage in a verbal repartee. They go back and forth using that sarcastic tone of voice that is supposed to be clever and slightly menacing at the same time (Demon: ""Oh, its so good to see you, Dean. How's your father?"" Dean: ""I should send you to hell"" Demon: ""Now that's not very nice"", etc.). There are entire scenes where all the dialogue is in that annoying sarcastic tone of voice, plus, the scenes are poorly written and usually poorly acted as well. The same goes for the emotional monologues, which tend to be overly sappy and sentimental. The writing on this show, in general, is just not that great.All that having been said, the show can be entertaining. So, whether or not you will like it will depend on how you feel about the criticisms I mentioned. Some people do not care that much about contrived writing, cliched characters, or repetitive drama. If those kinds of things are not that important to you I would recommend giving this show a try. If your main interest is in horror and suspense then this is a pretty good show and you will almost certainly be entertained. If the things I mentioned are important to you I would recommend watching this one for free before buying it. I would also recommend checking out The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or Veronica Mars first if, for some strange reason, you have not watched those shows yet. They are all, in my opinion, a lot better than this show.",3,Entertaining...,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,5785,"['premise', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'Two', 'brothers', 'job', 'hunt', 'supernatural',

The two actors who play the Winchester brothers play very well off of one another and have great chemistry. Jensen Ackles, who plays the older brother is really the break out star of this show as his performances are outstanding. On the surface he appears to be little more than the smart ass big brother who simply wants to hunt down and destroy any supernatural creature he possibly can. It doesn't take long for us to see that Sam (the youngest) is not the only compassionate brother. They both want to find their father and avenge their mother's death as well as help others along the way. Add the character of the father to the mix and things get even more interesting. This show is not just about two demon-hunting brothers. It also skillfully explores the complicated relationship not only between the brothers, but between the brothers and their father as well. Supernatural only gets better and better as the season progresses and has become much more than just a monster of the week show. Every episode has wonderful, witty dialogue and unlike some other 'generic' horror/sci-fi shows targeted at younger audiences, Supernatural purposely tries to be different and to stand out from the crowd (and succeeds). By the end of this first season, I was completely enthralled by the storylines and looked forward to the show every week. The action only gets better and better until the season finale that leaves you wondering, what are the Winchesters going to do next and how will they possibly top this in season 2?",5,Great characters and premise...,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1676,"['watched', 'show', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'premise', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Winchester', 'brothers', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'who', 'older', 'brother', 'really', 'break', 'star', 'show', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'surface', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'smart', 'ass', 'big', 'brother', 'who', 'simply', 'hunt', 'down', 'destroy', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'possibly', 'can', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'see', 'Sam', 'youngest', 'not', 'only', 'compassionate', 'brother', 'want', 'find', 'father', 'avenge', 'mother', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'others', 'way', 'Add', 'character', 'father', 'mix', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'demon-hunting', 'brothers', 'also', 'skillfully', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'not', 'only', 'brothers', 'brothers', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'Supernatural', 'only', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'progresses', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'monster', 'week', 'show', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'other', ""'generic"", 'horror/sci-fi', 'shows', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audiences', 'Supernatural', 'purposely', 'be', 'different', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'storylines', 'looked', 'forward', 'show', 'week', 'action', 'only', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'finale', 'wondering', 'what', 'are', 'Winchesters', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'how', 'will', 'possibly', 'top', 'season', '2']",N/A

993609,A3TKDDLMCYJKT1,B000FP2OPY,"C. Chung ""Christopher Chung""","[93, 96]","As a horror fan, I thought I'd seen it all.  However, in the near infinite myriad of programming vying for one's attention, Supernatural stands out as something both unique and refreshing.  If I could sum up the show in one word, it would be: SPECTACULAR!  The beauty of the show is it takes a simple premise: ""the great American road trip"" and it twists and turns it into a whole new entity and places it in the same category as some of the other great shows in the genre such as the 'X-Files' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', yet it still retains its own identity.First off, character development is outstanding.  With only two primary cast members, this was a critical issue to deal with, but Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles deliver their roles perfectly, almost as if they were brothers in real life.  The tension of the boys' relationship with their father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is also a noteworthy aspect of the show's excellent interpersonal dynamics, as it transcends the usual conventions and adds layer upon layer of love, hate, respect, and fear.  In addition, throughout the first season each character evolves as their battle with evil (and good) intensifies.  In the end everyone is stripped of their protective facades and are left vulnerable and exposed, with nothing but their true personas serving as a shield against an overwhelming enemy that seemingly can't be stopped.  Not only does this add a boost of realism, but it also charts the character's growth throughout the season leaving us with complex individuals instead of stagnant cardboard cutouts reset back to their ""same-old, same-old"" status quos by the end of the episode.Another refreshing aspect of the show, is, it doesn't insult the audience.  Existing horror conventions are borrowed, but almost all of them are updated into something new, as it successfully blends the insider info found in cult shows with the broader appeal of horror and action for the more mainstream audience.  What we get is a hybrid of the two.  On one hand terms and names of creatures or books are mentioned without any further explanation alluding to the notion that the show expects you to have some prior knowledge of the subject matter (such as skinwalkers).  Yet on the other hand it reassures you that if you don't know what they're talking about, you will by the end of the episode.  But there is never needless exposition.  Certainly you'll always get the crucial information at what's directly involved in the current plot, but the writers take the liberty of keeping some things a mystery, furthering the appeal of the show.  We as the viewer are assumed to know about some stuff, but if not, we're guaranteed to eventually know if we hitch a ride with the Winchester brothers and tag along for the journey.Stylistically, the show hits a home run by its deliberate use of a gritty and rural gothic look.  Ingrained in the series is a blue collar feel, an organic ""earthiness"" that lowers our defenses and brings things closer to home.  The Winchesters are not wealthy or flashy, nor are their friends or allies.  And with the exception of the beautiful and elfish Meg (Nicki Lynn Aycox), most of the characters are designed as everymen---the average Joes that could easily pass as our brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbors, or friends.  These people live cluttered lives far from the unrealistically neat and pristine glamor found in other shows.  Supernatural is not a trendy new pair of pants, it's the old pair of faded blue jeans with the holes in the knees that are the most comfortable to wear.  This is also demonstrated by music.  Gone is the high school Emo or current pop hit single, instead we get the Classic Rock that is so crucial for those long road trips when you need a good beat to keep you awake while driving the lonely highways at night.The show also boasts some impressive production values.  The film crew makes masterful use of lighting, and they're thankfully not afraid to film in the dark or to use heavy shadows.  I'm also repeatedly impressed with the excellent sound effects done by the Foley artists and sound designers.So why should you buy this? Supernatural is a crescendo of characterization, horror, action, twists, and sheer ingenuity that comes to a shocking season finale.  It's grounded in the notion that in our normal, everyday lives, something evil lurks just out of sight ready to strike, and odds are you won't be able to handle it without the help of two men in a black '67 Impala.If you're a fan of horror, urban legends, or just in the mood to watch something new, you owe it to yourself to check this show out.

993611,A7M2PR1AN8MQR,B000FP2OPY,celeste,"[0, 0]","The first season starts off with a young Sam and Dean who watch as their mother horrifyingly bursts into flames in front of them. Traumatized by this event, and in a spirit of revenge, they carry on their father's mission to become the sheriffs of all things supernatural. The first season has the main theme of Sam and Dean trying to find their mother's killer. Each episode of the first season involves Sam and Dean fighting creatures and killers from just about every horror film you can think of, which is a cool concept. I am not a fan of recurring formulas in a show (like SVU and similar shows). I like them to have substance and good storytelling. The second season was meh, much of what I remember was the brothers whining a lot. But then the 3rd season came along...Yes! This was what I had been looking for. Sam and Dean stopped whining so much and there was a new formula to the show. Instead of killing random thriller movie villains, Sam and Dean now have to stop the world from ending and still find their mother's killer. Also, we meet Castiel, the friendly angel and part of the comic relief in the show.The show remained great until the 6th season where things just got spastic and weird.

993613,AB34G6VKP28L,B000FP2OPY,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[14, 14]","Five minutes into the first episode, I knew the show had me hooked. It centers around two brothers making a desperate search of the paranormal for the creature that viciously attacked their mother and incinerated her in the family nursery. Dean, the elder of the two, is much more family-oriented. Tough on the outside but with a softer heart than he would like to admit, he's something of a ladies' man but when it comes to kicking demon backside, there's none better. Sam, the younger, by contrast, is something of an unwilling recruit, joining the ranks of ghost-slayers only because of the loss of his girlfriend, Jess. Throughout the first season, the boys meet and destroy a different evil being each week, while learning more about one another, themselves, and their elusive father, John.The DVD set is very nicely packaged. I was happy that the pilot episode is back to its normal length -- when it premiered on television, several minor scenes were cut and/or trimmed to adjust the running length. I had seen the full-length pilot online and thus was disappointed in the changes, but it's back to normal now. The only complaint I have is that I have had trouble with the final disk. The last episode sometimes plays, and sometimes freezes up and/or skips ahead, leading me to believe there may be a problem with the disk's internal formatting. Believing it was just an issue with my player, I asked around and it turns out several of my friends have had the same problem.

993620,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B000FP2OPY,Christie W.,"[4, 5]","Scary, spooky, edge-of-your-seat, eerie, suspenseful show. Supernatural takes on subjects of urban legends, lore- anything that goes bump in the night and uses those nightmares to create ""real-life"" battles of good versus evil (creatures of darkness-demons/ghosts/zombies etc).  The special effects are impressive for a TV show.It's riveting to watch; most times you can't imagine just what exactly is coming.  Season 2 is shaping out to be just as good.  The chemistry between the brothers is amazing- the comedic timing and overall combative relationship often results in hilarious laugh-out-loud moments.  Classic moments like Dean's fear of flying are played off perfectly; you can't help but chuckle over their antics.Even though I've already seen all the episodes, the show is entertaining enough to watch more than once.  The special features, though, are what really make the purchase worthwhile (at least for me).  They showcase the on-screen and off-screen antics between the two star characters (played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles).  They do the commentary on one episode and literally talk all the way through the whole episode- but it's ok because it's funny.  They seem to get along just as well off-screen as they do on.  Though, the bloopers and a day in the life of Jared and Jensen are my favorite- so ridiculous, it's hilarious!And for an added bonus- the fact that it stars two very cute guys doesn't hurt.. =DOverall a must-see show, don't miss out!",5,Supernatural-- A Must- Watch Show,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1479,"['Scary', 'spooky', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'eerie', 'suspenseful', 'show', 'Supernatural', 'subjects', 'urban', 'legends', 'lore-', 'anything', 'bump', 'night', 'nightmares', 'create', 'real-life', 'battles', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'creatures', 'darkness-demons/ghosts/zombies', 'etc', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'TV', 'show.It', 'riveting', 'watch', 'most', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'just', 'what', 'exactly', 'coming', 'Season', '2', 'shaping', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'chemistry', 'brothers', 'amazing-', 'comedic', 'timing', 'overall', 'combative', 'relationship', 'often', 'results', 'hilarious', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Classic', 'moments', 'Dean', 'fear', 'flying', 'are', 'played', 'off', 'perfectly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'antics.Even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', 'show', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'make', 'purchase', 'worthwhile', 'least', 'showcase', 'on-screen', 'off-screen', 'antics', 'two', 'star', 'characters', 'played', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'do', 'commentary', 'one', 'episode', 'literally', 'talk', 'way', 'whole', 'episode-', 'ok', 'funny', 'seem', 'get', 'along', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'off-screen', 'do', 'Though', 'bloopers', 'day', 'life', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'are', 'favorite-', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'hilarious', 'added', 'bonus-', 'fact', 'two', 'very', 'cute', 'guys', ""n't"", 'hurt..', '=DOverall', 'must-see', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out']",N/A

With a fresh new take on classic ubarn myths such as Bloody Mary, the Wendigo, and the Hook Man, as well as classic monsters such as ghosts, vampires, and witches, the series provides great entertainment and well written plotlines.  Our two strong lead characters don't hurt either.The series focuses on two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester(Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively), who lost their mother to a mysterious demonic force when they were young.  Ever since then, their father(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has become determined to destroy the monster, and has been training them to defeat all supernatural threats.  Sam eventually leaves and tries to start a life of his own, but after his girlfriend is killed in the exact same fashion as the mother and the father goes missing, he reunites with Dean to finally destroy the monster for good.  Complicating matters is that they're being hunted by a mysterious girl(Nicki Lynn Aycox) that seems to have a connection to the same demon that's been the source of all their troubles.As many sci-fi/horror series, it focuses on about 6 or so episodes worth of story while the others are pretty much monster-of-the-week fare, but even these are quite entertaining, providing enough twists and turns throughout each individual story to keep the viewer glued.  Padalecki and Ackles also work extremely well as the two brothers, Ackles in particular as Dean, who can be quite a bit of a smartass, providing a few amusing moments through all the usual terror that's going on.The WB has recently had it tough with their sci-fi/horror genre.

It looked interesting and, of course, I had no idea what was going on. I watched about 3 episodes of Season 8 and thought I will get Season 1 and figure it out. It is really weird(a good weird) watching the beginning and the current. Let me tell you that I am a total fanatic in a hell of a hurry. I absolutely love this show and it grabbed me from behind from the get go and no let up on the grip. I stay up way too late watching. I cannot get enough of this one. I love the 1st season and my favorite episode is Skin where the shape-shifter turns into Dean. He is the ultimate smart ass and I identify with that. He has the best one-liners that I have ever heard in my life. The writing is fantastic and you would actually think the 2 actors are brothers in real life. They have such an obvious on-screen chemistry, such that I have never seen before. The chemistry was obvious from the get go. It also helps that the 2 of them are extemely easy on the eyes, let alone that they are really great actors and they make it look effortless. It is so addicting and what a wonderful addiction to have. I was busy doing martial arts when this one started so not being home I missed this one, thankfully getting them on DVD is just the best. Whether you are new to the series(as I am) or a fan from the beginning, there is no denying that this show is superb and sublime. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes this genre. I would give it 10 stars if that were an option. The boxed set is great and I love the extras. The gag reel included is worth it in itself, seeing the goof ups and the humor. The music hooked me from the beginning too. The references they make with the dectective names is something that surprised me in that I actually get them.

In fact, the first episode flat out left me bored.  Despite that I gave the rest of the season a try and it wasn't long before it became one of my favorite shows.The characters are dynamic and deep.  The storyline, though it at first seems quite simple, turns complicated and intelligent.  It's not a soap opera/chick flick and it's nothing like the Twilight-esque shows we're being bombarded with lately (Vampire Diaries, True Blood, etc.).  It's dark, deep and surprisingly hilarious.

993632,A1R6RKKE44AYA8,B000FP2OPY,"Diane K. Miller ""diinIN""","[5, 7]","If you are even remotely considering buying this DVD set, hesitate no further.  Supernatural ended basically a 30-year boycott of TV for me, during which time I saw just enough to decide that nothing out there was worth watching.This one is different.  Never dreamed I would plan my schedule around a TV show...  If it hadn't been advertised on the internet, I would never have found it, as I didn't even know a WB channel existed.  But Yahoo's little tease was enticing (""Is this show too scary for television?""), and I actually sat there and watched the entire pilot on a 4"" screen, and was hooked in the first 4 minutes.  So is my family--ages 11 to 53, as are my 70-ish parents.The entire cast and crew is stellar, and the all-around quality is light-years better than anything I've ever seen.  Jared and Jensen have mastered their art with these characters, so much so that you forget they are acting.  Sam is the brainy, sensitive, perceptive, troubled guy, while Dean is cocky, sarcastic, impulsive, and has no respect for authority.  They are polar opposites in every respect, and sometimes butt heads at critical moments.  But there is a deep bond between them, a love that comes out in subtle ways, but simply can't be demonstrated overtly.  That just wouldn't be cool.  (""Hey.  No chick flick moments."")  The relationship of the brothers and complex family dynamic is the #1 reason I watch.The classic rock music has become a signature of the show, really fits the characters and the setting, and has opened up for me a whole new world that I missed the first time around because I was too busy listening to schmooze.But aside from the exceptional acting, fascinating characters, and cool music, the series has everything that makes a show excel: compelling storylines, unexpected humor at the most unlikely moments, conflict, suspense, gore, and three really hot guys (I include the dad, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), not to mention some ""smokin'"" (as Dean puts it) women guest stars, eye candy for all the men watching out there.  The viewer truly becomes emotionally engaged with the characters.  It's been refreshing to discover a series that is so carefully and skillfully crafted.  How they put it all together on the fast-paced timetable of series TV is beyond comprehension.The season gets still better as it goes along.  The guest stars in the latter part of the season were just incredible.  This is a show for both genders, but being scary and sometimes bloody and gross, it's not for young kids.  It's rated TV14, though I'd consider that pretty conservative.If I were forced to choose which episodes were the worst, I'd settle on Bugs (storyline was lame), Water (guest stars were marginal), and Route 666 (guest stars were horrible, story wasn't too hot either).  But even those three are worth watching.  There's always something to save the show.  In Bugs, it's a really critical conversation between Sam and Dean, and some great humor.  In Water, the story was good.  In Route 666, Sam's pesky little brother routine was great.The best episodes for me were Pilot, Home, Asylum, Skin, Benders (Wow!), Nightmare (AWESOME), Hell House (hilarious!), Wicked, Provenance (really spooky), Salvation, and Trap.  I know, that's hardly narrowing it down, but hey, you just can't.  It's too good.  I didn't exactly like the vampires in Blood, but the writers did well with it, and Luther made the vamps worth watching...not to mention that one of my favorite scenes of the season was in that episode, an intense fight between Sam and his father showcasing some incredible acting by Jared.My only complaint is the absolutely wretched cliffhanger at the end.  Did the writers honestly think they had to pull something like that to get us to come back next season??  Thank heaven for spoilers, or this summer would have killed me.You will not be disappointed if you buy this DVD set.  You will likely watch each episode more than once, so you're talking many hours of entertainment for a reasonable cost.  The extras are so much fun--several cut scenes, a hilarious gag reel, and more fun commentaries and visits on the set.  It's cool to see what goes on behind the scenes, very neat to see the guys as they truly are, and fascinating to hear how all this came about.AWESOME job, cast and crew!  You should be proud!  You're not killing yourself for nothing up there in Vancouver.THANK YOU to the CW for picking this show up.

No sooner do we lose shows like Buffy and Firefly, then along come high calibre shows like Dr Who and Supernatural to take up the slack.Supernatural follows the adventures of two brothers - Sam and Dean Winchester, played respectively by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. The show focuses on the these two guys as they do battle with a variety of monsters, all the time trying to locate their missing father and find the demon that killed their mother 20 years previously, and that more recently killed Sam's girlfriend. Having been trained by their father to hunt down and destroy ghosts, monsters etc, following the death of their mother, each episode sees them take on creatures such as The Wendigo, Bloody Mary, vampires, spirits, dead serial killers, killer trucks... to name just a few!All the time though, little bits of information come their way regarding their father, and the nature of the demon that they are trying to track down. This gives the whole series a real flow and while each episode is a self contained and generally excellent story, everything builds up nicely to the series finale which is superb when it arrives.Characterisation is really good, the banter and bonhommie between the two brothers is well realised and enjoyable. Jensen Eckles is great as the wise cracking and protective older brother - Dean. Jared Padalecki shines as the sensitive and thoughtful Sam, the younger brother who has been forced by events to go 'hunting', rather than be there by choice. Equally clashes between the two brothers are shown and realistically depicted.Their father is very well played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan when he makes his appearances, and is a well fleshed out portrayal of sadness and pathos.I have watched every episode of Supernatural and like any series, some episodes are better than others. Taken as a whole though, this is first class entertainment and really is a credit to its cast and makers.

The licensing for just those sound clips must take a large chunk out of the show's budget, I can tell you that.Another cool thing about Supernatural is the Batman-like black vintage sports car the brothers ride around in.

Now I'm working my way through the seasons, starting from the beginning.This first season is a real mixed bag. At it's core there's clearly potential right from the pilot episode. But there's also a lot of stand alone ""monster of the week"" type stuff that doesn't do much for me.The show started on the WB network and then transfered to the CW when WB and UPN merged. It shows. There's a distinctly WB look and feel at least in these early episodes. Young cast, lots of music, montages etc.The cast of regular characters is very (too) small. Basically the Winchester brothers have to hold everything together themselves and the two actors, though clearly picked for their looks, actually hold up their ends pretty well.But the lack of any sort of supporting cast (there are only two other actors who appear more than once) is a major problem and the show rapidly falls into formula and feels like it's treading water.Yes there are some nice bits of brotherly interaction. But we have the meet a nice girl, but have to part ways story played out twice in the first season.  The show just needs a larger recurring cast.Fortunately the character of Meg Masters shows up in episode 11 and we finally get to see some progress in the story arc.

The first season has a few stumbles with awkward acting between two guys who really try their best to create a brother dynamic. Then, there is an episode or two with awkward plot or poor effects. All this aside, it is hands down a solid first season. Throughout it all, the show defines the world it takes place in; we find out how the brothers came to hunt all things that go bump in the night and we also find out what tools they use for the most common jobs. Kinda of a family roadshow that really should be rated R but still kicks butt at a PG-13.The show really shines in its use of mythologies from around the world. A lot of the demon-talk falls into Russian and Japanese folklore, American urban legends, the wendigo are from Native American lore, and it seems they are always looking for ways to further the 'standard jobs', e.g. a hunt may start off seeming to be one thing, but the brothers later learn it's actually something else. No trope is overused however.The DVD set has my all time favourite special feature, never before seen - the ability to not watch the 'previously, on Supernatural' shorts. Watching Supernatural quickly becomes a daily event: get home from work, eat dinner, send the kids to bed and watch an episode or three. The pace of the storytelling gets a bit more mileage without the story so far segments. The commentaries are insightful: we hear how the car used eventually became the '67 Impalla (because it sounds like a monster), why Dean listens to a lot of 80's hair rock and Classic rock (the songs were cheaper on the production budget). Then there are the stand-bys: a few behind the scenes, deleted scenes and the like.The show is about family. And it seems that the cast and crew became just that during the first year of the show.

By interest in the occult, I assumed that he meant that he found my sacrifice of a virginal chicken upon the passing of the Winter Solstice to be a slight deviation of social memes.  I immediately shot back that ""social memes"" is a big brain talking point for nerd-ville and that the marking of a new growing season has always been recognized in blood, and THAT should be the social meme, not a jolly fat man sneaking into your house to drop off candy for your kids.  Sheesh, it's like I have to explain everything!Anywhoo,This series follows the lives of two brothers who hunt demons and find a way to end up shirtless by the end of every episode.  It's kind of like The Ghost Whisperer in that way.  In EVERY episode Jennifer Love Hewitt is seen, at least once, walking around in a night gown.  She hunts ghosts or something... but she wears a silky nighty.  Every episode.  It is spectacularly awesome.  Seriously, it's the best show ever.  Watch the show if you doubt me.Often times the mythos and creatures that are fought off every episode are not particularly compelling or original.  However, do not let this dissuade you from watching.  The true creative genius of this show is the brother dynamic that is both carefully and skillfully written into each episode.  There is pure comic timing as well as tender moments expressed between the sensitive brother Jared Padaleckidakciakdibikcicky (Sam) and the strong and obnoxious Jensen Ackles (Dean).  The first season introduces the characters, the basic monster of the week premise and an overarching mother-killing-demon conspiracy.This is what is original.This is what is compelling.Lest you forget, original founders of this great country that is the United States of America were hunting witches and killing Bigfoots (BigFeet?) the moment they got off the boat during that tea party in Boston.  I'm pretty sure I read that Christopher Columbus was a ghost hunter in his down time.  Or a spice merchant... I always get it mixed up....In any event, beyond the monsters stories, comic timing, and character development, there are the rippling abs of the two costars...  Never before have I witnessed such fine specimens of human physiology....  Not that their bodies do anything for me, per say, I like women!  I do!  I'm married and everything!  That's proof right?  But my wife LOVES Dean, and therefore the show.  I'm not sure she knows there are even monsters involved... if you were to ask her she'd say the show is about two brothers driving around the country acting as farm hands....Silly girl...Now, where's that Ghost Whisperer show....",5,Preternatural...in my world anyway...,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2728,"['dear', 'friend', 'mine', 'first', 'lent', 'series', 'DVDs', 'thinking', 'might', 'enjoy', 'given', 'interest', 'occult', 'interest', 'occult', 'assumed', 'meant', 'found', 'sacrifice', 'virginal', 'chicken', 'passing', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'be', 'slight', 'deviation', 'social', 'memes', 'immediately', 'shot', 'back', 'social', 'memes', 'big', 'brain', 'talking', 'point', 'nerd-ville', 'marking', 'new', 'growing', 'season', 'always', 'been', 'recognized', 'blood', 'should', 'be', 'social', 'meme', 'not', 'jolly', 'fat', 'man', 'sneaking', 'house', 'drop', 'off', 'candy', 'kids', 'Sheesh', 'have', 'explain', 'everything', 'Anywhoo', 'series', 'lives', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'hunt', 'demons', 'find', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'shirtless', 'end', 'episode', 'kind', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'way', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'walking', 'around', 'night', 'gown', 'ghosts', 'something', 'silky', 'nighty', 'episode', 'spectacularly', 'awesome', 'Seriously', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'Watch', 'show', 'doubt', 'me.Often', 'times', 'mythos', 'creatures', 'are', 'fought', 'off', 'episode', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'original', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'dissuade', 'watching', 'true', 'creative', 'genius', 'show', 'brother', 'dynamic', 'carefully', 'skillfully', 'written', 'episode', 'pure', 'comic', 'timing', 'as', 'well', 'tender', 'moments', 'expressed', 'sensitive', 'brother', 'Jared', 'Padaleckidakciakdibikcicky', 'Sam', 'strong', 'obnoxious', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Dean', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'basic', 'monster', 'week', 'premise', 'overarching', 'mother-killing-demon', 'conspiracy.This', 'what', 'original.This', 'what', 'compelling.Lest', 'forget', 'original', 'founders', 'great', 'country', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'were', 'hunting', 'witches', 'killing', 'Bigfoots', 'BigFeet', 'moment', 'got', 'off', 'boat', 'tea', 'party', 'Boston', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'read', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'was', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'down', 'time', 'spice', 'merchant', 'always', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'event', 'monsters', 'stories', 'comic', 'timing', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'rippling', 'abs', 'two', 'costars', 'Never', 'have', 'witnessed', 'such', 'fine', 'specimens', 'human', 'physiology', 'Not', 'bodies', 'do', 'anything', 'say', 'like', 'women', 'do', ""'m"", 'married', 'everything', 'proof', 'right', 'wife', 'LOVES', 'Dean', 'therefore', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'even', 'monsters', 'involved', 'were', 'ask', ""'d"", 'say', 'show', 'two', 'brothers', 'driving', 'country', 'acting', 'farm', 'hands', '.Silly', 'girl', 'Now', 'where', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'show']",N/A

Years later when their father disappears, they take up his journal in hopes of finding him and some answers but end up taking up where he left off solving the mysterious of the paranormal.The series has all the fun and creepiness of ""The X-Files"" minus romantic tension (with a substitution of sibling rivalry) and the absence of bureaucracy and Cigarette Smoking Man. Dean and Sam hit the road with reckless abandon drifting from place to place surviving on money they make hustling people at pool and poker so they can continue the hunt for answers.Sam (Jared Padalecki) left his college to go on this road trip with his brother after a mysterious incident with his girlfriend passing the exact same way as his mother and being driven into the same obsession as his father (Jeffery Dean Morgan). Dean (Jensen Ackles) is an obedient son with a bit of swagger whose quest in the supernatural has been ongoing his entire life. In this formula, Sam is Luke Skywalker and Dean is Han Solo and their classic muscle car is the Millennium Falcon. Their relationship is constantly being tested through these ghost hunts and the buddy road trip vibe serves the series well.Padalecki and Ackles have an easy going relationship and chemistry that ties each individual episode together. Each episode is like a mini-movie, but the fluctuations of their interactions create the overall arc of the tension in their family and search for their father and their mother's killer.The urban legends are fantastic with everything from Bloody Mary to the man with the hook that kills the boyfriend, to the ghost woman getting picked up on the side of the road wanting to go home, to a freaky scarecrow god in a field! Doubtless, there is something for everyone here and thrills and chills galore.Bonus Features:There are over five hours of additional content! Tons and tons of extras for your viewing pleasure.Supernatural: Tales from the Edge of Darkness is purely a making-of featurette about how the series was created, the casting of the two stars, and what challenges the show faced in shaping the concept to get picked up. A Day in the Life of Jared & Jensen follows them as they explore the catering table and go through filming in an episode. There is a Paley Festival Panel Discussion featuring Cast & Crew talking about the first season of ""Supernatural"" and answering questions from the audience and discussing how the brothers were cast.Devil's Road Map: Interactive Map Guide to Season One's Urban Legends and Unusual facts is the best feature on this set because you can go episode by episode and watch interviews about how and why a certain story was developed, myths about actual local legends in a given area, and if you click on haunted icons, there is an easter egg surprise. There is also access to pages of their dad's journal.Commentary on the ""Pilot"" by series creator Eric Kripke, director David Nutter, and producer Peter Johnson reveals what true nerds they all are and how much they love their work investigating all these urban legends and old stories and finding ways to incorporate them into the show. They talk about all the different drafts of the pilot and how it evolved over time. Commentary on ""Phantom Traveler"" by co-stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles consists of the two of them joking a lot but also talking about the acting perspective in creating the episode.

993669,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000FP2OPY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","A new series is always something delicate because we must forget about all other series and try to get into the new one without any preconceived ideas. And that is difficult.I am going to deal with ideas that will be true for the next seasons first. The main idea, the center of the series itself is a triad of three things: the car, the family and the demon. Note what's more that from the very start the family is reduced to three men, the father John and his two sons Dean and Sam Winchester.This triad of father-elder-son-younger-son is kind of constituted from the very start of the first episode. The elder son comes up one day and literally seizes his younger brother from college to go get their father who has been absent for something like a week. Then this triad is only two looking for the third one. In this season the father will appear as a glimpse in the ninth episode when the two sons come ""home"" to clean up the house where their mother was killed. Then he will materialize for good in episode 16, then he disappears again and finally turns back up in the last three episodes of the season in which he is at least at the end possessed by THE demon the sons and father have been hunting down. Dean realizes at the end the father is not normal but cannot shoot him and then Sam will have the opportunity to do it but he will wound the father and let the demon go away. So much for the family.There are many demons, some being more powerful than others. The ""yellow-eyed"" one that the two brother and the father are after is a really powerful one, and can command lower ranks demons (that are recognizable by their black eyes). So the father and sons have been chasing the various supernatural phenomena, because it is what they know how to deal with and what they consider to be their job. Yet they are often no links with the demons (yet the more the series go on, the more they are caught in a large web drawn by higher forces from Hell and Heaven). The demons are an extraordinary and rare supernatural opponent that the brothers are not skilled enough to fight properly (yet). Their path is drawn by the supernatural events that are coming onto their way and that they must take care of, learning as they do, to be brothers again. This is then a long picaresque voyage across America but entirely dressed in supernatural and partly horror garb.The third element is the car, a black Chevrolet Impala 1967, Dean's car actually that becomes the car of the hunt. The car is the only means of transportation or nearly. Only one episode involved planes and a plane flight (And Dean is actually scared to get in it, which defines, in a way, a circle that cannot be left, drawn around the car). The car takes the brothers from one place to the next and the road is their world. Along with this road we go from one motel to the next and from one diner to the next, not to speak of gas stations, not too many, true, and other road ""furniture and contraption"" without which there would be no travelling. Actually the series does not insist on that too much and along with this horse powered picaresque search we are constantly entertained by music, mostly rock music (which is strange since radio stations are always local and thus can vary a lot from one place to the next, and we do not get any country music nor gospel and other Christian music, nor, and that is absolutely amazing, black music, I mean negro spirituals, jazz, black rock and roll, rap and other forms of that ethnic musical world) (In some episodes we can see that they actually use tapes, and besides, they are able to switch the channel).We should wonder about the geography of the journey: it goes from California to New York and covers practically all the regions except the South. Actually that exclusion, so far, of the south enables the authors and producers to avoid Voodoo (or Vodun) magic and witchcraft. This means the demon they are looking for is a white demon, a demon from the white tradition. Malefic of course, diabolical of course and deeply antichristian: it is thus sensitive to holy water, salt and other standard protections, not to speak of the possibility to exorcize it out of the possessed people. We will note it is visually identified as some kind of dark smoke coming out of the possessed person through the mouth and the master demon is absorbing the soul of a sleeping child through his mouth and out of the child's mouth in a form of a luminous vapor. We remain in the medieval tradition as for that, including the devil's trap in episode 22, fundamentally a pentacle or pentagram in a circle in a triangle representing the devil contained in the circle of God's creation contained in God's trinity.Note, the Yellow-eyed demon does not feed on the babies, but actually feed them (selected babies that are supposed to possess some special abilities - Sam being one of them) with demon blood to make them stronger.Many other subjects should be examined but I would like to say a few words on the father and his sons. There is a strong tradition of authority and respect of authority in this family, and it is common for a son to say ""yessir"" to his father. Sam actually represents a certain amount of rebellion against that authority and this rebellious spirit should be scrutinize, though it is an essential dramatic element because it is always at a crucial moment this element occurs. It dictates some very deeply dramatic and potentially tragic emotions in the spectators when that rebellion comes just when the worst catastrophe is going to happen, and when the stake is to kill the father because he is possessed. What son will ever be able to do that?The two brothers on the other side are deeply attached to each other. Their love is absolute and it means death if it is necessary to save the other and it means complete and permanent cooperation. It also has some moments of doubt and rebellion but these deepen the relation instead of breaking it. They live in absolute spatial promiscuity but the film is very careful not to show it, and when it does it does so with great modesty. In fact this physical promiscuity is constantly present in the series because the two brothers are always looking into each other's eyes. It is ocular promiscuity to a degree that justifies the joke in episode 8 about their gender or sexual orientation. It is true Dean is quite often looking at girls and both of them have an episode from time to time, but in fact less than we should expect from two healthy young men slightly over twenty.But the next season is prepared with the escape of the master demon and the salvation of ,the father. Let's wait for the next episode.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU (with some help of Ivan EVE)",5,"So far fascinating, though some episodes are off-key",1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,6728,"['new', 'series',

993675,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000FP2OPY,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[8, 11]","Supernatural is probably the best new show next to Prison Break. It stars Jared Padalecki (House of Wax, Cry Wolf) as Sam and Jensen Ackles (Dark Angel, Smallville season 4) as Dean who are  two brothers who set out to destroy the evil that's all over the world. After their mother was killed by a demon when they were little, it became sort of a family business. Sam wants out though and to go to college. He decides to stick with Dean once his g/f is killed the same way their mother was. Throughout the season they are also curious to where their dad is and why he hasn't called. He too is out hunting demons and evil spirits.The show isn't always scary and it can be silly how they easily walk on crime scenes and make believe they are cops or anyone else for that matter. Plus there's a little too many earlier episodes that just end with them cruising away in Dean's car listening to classic rock. Still though this is good tv and two leads are always fun together. Even if it isn't scary, it's always entertaining. Jensen Ackles gets a character that he's really good at playing....a sarcastic wiseass with funny one-liners. He was wasted in Smallville as Lana's b/f Jason who was mostly just there to be jealous of her and Clark. Here he actually gets to shine and play a fun kickass character.While Invasion and Surface were already canceled while they both claimed to have been season finales, I hope this show comes back. Especially with how the season ended. Canelation would be a shame since the WB needs this show since Charmed is gone and since Smallvile was disapointing last season since they focused way way way too much on the super played out Lana/Clark relationship. Then when they put her with Lex things even got worse. So the WB needs Supernatural bad, it's a show that has Buffy or Charmed potential or eventually maybe it could be even better than both.",4,The best new series next to Prison Break!,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,1879,"['Supernatural', 'probably', 'best', 'new', 'show', 'next', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'House', 'Wax', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'Sam', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Smallville', 'season', '4', 'Dean', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'evil', 'world', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'demon', 'when', 'were', 'little', 'became', 'sort', 'family', 'business', 'Sam', 'out', 'go', 'college', 'stick', 'Dean', 'once', 'g/f', 'killed', 'same', 'way', 'mother', 'was', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'curious', 'where', 'dad', 'why', ""n't"", 'called', 'too', 'out', 'hunting', 'demons', 'evil', 'spirits.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'always', 'scary', 'can', 'be', 'silly', 'how', 'easily', 'walk', 'crime', 'scenes', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'cops', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'little', 'too', 'many', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'just', 'end', 'cruising', 'away', 'Dean', 'car', 'listening', 'classic', 'rock', 'Still', 'good', 'tv', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'together', 'Even', ""n't"", 'scary', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'character', 'really', 'good', 'playing', '.a', 'sarcastic', 'wiseass', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'was', 'wasted', 'Smallville', 'Lana', 'b/f', 'Jason', 'who', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'be', 'jealous', 'Clark', 'Here', 'actually', 'shine', 'play', 'fun', 'kickass', 'character.While', 'Invasion', 'Surface', 'were', 'already', 'canceled', 'claimed', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'finales', 'hope', 'show', 'back', 'Especially', 'how', 'season', 'ended', 'Canelation', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'WB', 'show', 'Charmed', 'gone', 'Smallvile', 'was', 'disapointing', 'last', 'season', 'focused', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'super', 'played', 'out', 'Lana/Clark', 'relationship', 'Then', 'when', 'put', 'Lex', 'things', 'even', 'got', 'worse', 'WB', 'Supernatural', 'bad', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Charmed', 'potential', 'eventually', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'better']",N/A

Actually, I think the character's have very good chemistry, also like the classic rock music, muscle cars, & the beautiful cast. So what I don't care for is this show is lacking in suspense & storylines aren't as good as a show like Smallville. The storylines can be better for each episode.

One day I was ill and caught a couple of episodes on daytime reruns.  I thought it seemed interesting and decided to pick up the first season on DVD just to see if it all would be as watchable as the ones I saw.  It didn't take long to become fully hooked, buy the other four seasons, and preorder season 6.Even though the theme material is complete fantasy, it's completely believable.  It's done so well, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see someone's eyes do the demon thing and think ""Well, I always wondered about him/her!""  It's also been fun learning things about the different myths and cultures.The characters are amazing and are played amazingly well.  Very real.  The surprise has been Jensen Ackles who plays Dean Winchester.  I kind of thought he would be a ""one-note"" actor.  He plays such a tough guy in this series, much like his character in the My Bloody Valentine remake.  However, as you watch you see many sides to this versatile actor.  He can be very funny.  Check out Hollywood Babylon (season 2) and see what I mean.  He can also be very tender and has often brought me to the verge of tears.It's a tribute to Jared Padalecki that he can play Sam Winchester as such a compassionate, caring character with such strength that he doesn't get lost in the wake of Dean's charge ahead attitude.And, did I mention the eye candy factor?Anyway, both my 12 year old son and I really enjoy this series.

The premise is interesting and the creatures they fight are fleshed out nicely in each episode. It's genuinely scary, but rises far above simple horror entertainment. The characters are three dimensional, with issues and emotions that seem very real in spite of the fantastical context of the series. The chemistry between Ackles and Padalecki is excellent. They play so well off each other, you'd swear they were brothers in real life too. There's a lot of fun, witty banter and great pop culture references. The music is awesome and perfectly matches the ambience of the show. It pretty much has everything I'm looking for in a series- action, drama, and humor. The only thing it lacks is romance. There's a few one episode love interests but I'd rather see something more ongoing. But that's a minor quibble and I can understand how fitting in a long term romance would be difficult given the way the show's layed out. Anyway, I highly recommend this series.

The costumes, locations, and sets are heavy on black, gray, navy, hunter green--it's got a wonderful dark and creepy feel.  The two leads are just gorgeous to look at--and they are also fine actors with deep expressive voices.  Their emotional relationship is the heart of the show.  I'm not a huge horror fan--I close my eyes during some of the special effects that draw in the most fans, I suppose.  It's only ""monster of the week"" on a superficial level--and it has plenty of that.  But there's an emotional journey--the relationship between the brothers evolves, the relationship between them and their father is revealed slowly, and Sam starts to develop some interesting abilties that will be important later and freak his brother out a bit.  The relationship between the boys has a Mulder-Scully feel of deep caring.  There's plenty of sibling rivalry and brotherly pranks and humor, too.  This show is a lot of fun--it's deep and dark, but funny and touching.  It's perfect for late at night in a dark and quiet house.  A few of the episodes are weaker than the others--but the number of really quality episodes is quite high.The show is both scary and emotionally satisfying.

But it is the chemistry between the brothers that keeps me entranced. The older operates on gut instinct, and is quicker to have a physical response. The younger, who has left college to join his older brother, is more intuitive and thoughtful. And what a wicked, referential sense of humor the script has! Referencing everything from Orville Redenbacher to the film ""Deliverance,"" it's a treat for TV and movie trivia buffs.

I love how the right mood is set with the lighting, directing, and the music.  The visual effects are incredible-with the greatest details. It is horror movie but very tastefully done.

If you are a fan of the X-files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer you will also like this series.The episodes that are included:Episode I (pilot) Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) hook up due to their Dad being on a ""hunting trip"" from which he has never returned. They encounter a mysterious ghost, and accomplish their first ghost killing mission together as adults.  Sam's girlfriend mysteriously dies the same way the boys Mother died soon after Sam was born.Wendigo  Sam and Dean encounter a a strange spirit of Indian lore while hunting for their Father.Dead in the Water A series of drownings in a lake in Wisconsin soon becomes seen by Sam and Dean as the work of a vengeful spiritPhantom Traveler  A jet crashes due to a phantom that takes over pilots/random people/stewardesses on a flight. Sam and Dean attempt an airborn exorcism.Bloody Mary  Sam and Dean discover a ghoul who lives in mirrors who gorges out the eyes of its prey that must be stoppedSkin A demonic shape shifter, who also appears at one point as Dean, causes a lot of mischeif and mayhem.Hook Man  Based on the suburban myth of the man with a hook who attacks couples on datesBugs  Sam and Dean investigate outbreaks of insects in a developement that was once a sacred Indian land (that has a curse attached)Route 666  Sam and Dean investigate a series of murders by someone-or something-in a big truck that targets African American victims at first.  A pretty blonde who is a recurring character with a secret starts appearing.Nightmare  The two brothers pose as priests in order to gain access to a house where their has been a mysterious murder. Sam realizes his psychic abilities.The Benders  Shades of Deliverance abound in this tale about backwoods people who like to hunt humans. Sam is taken as a prize and Dean has to rescue himShadow  A shadow killer is hunting random people-or so it seems.  Sam uses his psychic powers to help find potential victims.Hell House  A house is a place for a homicidal spirit, but Sam and Dean's efforts are thwarted by a pair of strange paranormal investigators who want to use ghosts to pick up girls.Something Wicked  A witch is terryfying a small town, and this witch has ties to the boyhoods of the Winchester brothers.Provenance  A portrait of a long dead family has an equally horrifying history and causes murders when purchased.Dead Mans Blood  The boys Father (played by Jeffrey DEan Morgan) is finally reunited with his sons.  The Vampires  have gotten possession of a gun that is rumoured to kill anything, ghost or demonic.Salvation  A demonically possessed woman Sam met reappears, with disasterous consequences-she wants the gun that can kill anything, and John (the boys Father) is kidnapped so she can get it.Devil's Trap  This is the season finale.  Anything is game concerning the gun, and getting back Dad.  A riveting final shot ends the series of season IAlso, the special features are wonderful on this DVD set, particularly the Gag real.

If you liked those two shows you will love Supernatural, and if you did not like those two series you will enjoy Supernatural anyway. It's a modern action-adventure/horror/thriller/mystery/supernatural drama classic. Also, if you enjoy classic rock music and cool vintage cars, it will be hard to turn this show off. Supernatural does everything right to captivate an audience and leave them wanting more.Once you start following Dean and Sam Winchester across the country tracking and killing evil things, you will be trapped in their world, wanting more stories after every episode.

I made an exception for Supernatural!So many things could have been wrong with this show...how do I even start?  The special effects could have been crappy, the dialogue could have been flat, the plot twists could have been unnatural...BUT none of them were!  I was so impressed with the cunning cinematography that offers just the right amount of horror and tension without depending on CG animation for a scare factor.  I love how the premise of two brothers chasing demons was only the beginning of the show, not the audience's final conclusion.  The audience can actually feel smarter for watching Supernatural, because it is so much better compared to countless other shows.  It is simultaneously heartfelt and comedic, dangerous and fun, suspenseful and tragic.  How two guys in a cool car can make that kind of show, I don't know, but I wish I could meet them!This show is mix of the Hardy Boys and Harry Dresden.  The main characters are two who could have been normal guys, but chose not to be.  They may be on the wrong side of the law, but their mission is to help others and bring justice to evil monsters everywhere.  These guys are all-American patriots with a bit of a bent on solving the unfathomable.  Both leads in this show are rich in character; Sam's energy and Dean's endurance sustain them through countless tough situations, but as they learn to depend on one another, the more they come to value each other's unique skills.  Sam's character instantly won me over with his smart initiative, and I sympathized with him: The younger brother who struggles to find his place in a world gone mad.  But it was Dean's character that became my fast and definite favorite and I particularly enjoyed how it was revealed through the first season.  He is unflinchingly brave and tough as nails, but under his rough exterior is a more sensitive man who struggles with showing his true emotions.  He is the older protective brother who will do anything humanly possible (and a lot that isn't) to keep his family safe.Please do yourself a favor and watch this show.  It is the most moving and understated bit of television on the market right now and it deserves as big a following as it can achieve.The only thing I regret about this show is that I did not discover it sooner.

993702,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000FP2OPY,Marc Cabir Davis,"[5, 12]","I really think that this is the gayest show on television right now.There is even a video homage on Youtube that dwells on the un-subtle sexual tension between lead actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. I don't know if this is true, but when I watched the Special Features (a documentary entitled ""A Day with Jared and Jensen""), it was clear that both the actors had eyes for no one but each other. They hold hands, go piggy-back riding, look fondly into each others' eyes, and finish each others' sentences. Sorry, but I don't remember doing things like this with my best friend - I only did these things with the person I was in a relationship with. Watch the Special Features section just for this - the sexual tension between both actors is so palpable, it would take only the most stoic of fans not to acknowledge it.The show itself is a fine effort. The brothers, Sam and Dean, along with their father, go from town to town facing increasingly macabre and frightful demons and monsters. Some episodes are quite convoluted and a mess (the `vampire' one, especially), and also the one where they're trapped in a mental asylum and go crazy themselves. Some of the supposed-to-be scary monsters aren't very scary either, which I found a huge turn-off. However, the smart writing, and the boys' tumultuous relationship with their never-present father is a great storyline, and these emotions were very well acted out.A Hollywood source on a Jared fansite states that the two actors who play brothers are in fact in a real life relationship with each other. Seriously, I couldn't care less, but even before I knew this, I was struck with the very homoerotic undertones to the entire series. The actors play the brothers more like jilted lovers who run back to each other after they have a fight, and Jensen Ackles' body language in particular should be seen to be believed. If there was ever an actor who was `into' a fellow actor, Jensen is the one. I seriously think they should have slapped on a few kissing scenes to get it over with.Not everyone would share my opinion in this review, but I do think that the love affair between the lead actors leads to some fine chemistry. The documentary only proves this. On screen, it translates to some great timing and in-sync acting from both. Jared Padalecki in particular is especially good when he has dialogue with Jensen Ackles. At other times he looks a little lost and directionless. In fact, the producers' attempts to pair these actors off with women in some of the episodes look very `forced'. And their heterosexual romantic scenes here are not very interesting.Its funny, because I got this thinking it to be a fine horror/mystery type television show, but its one big gay lovefest. Not that that's a bad thing, its just that I didn't expect it. I just hope that they tone down the homoerotic overtones in Season 2 because seriously it was inappropriate considering the two leads in love are playing brothers.Three Stars.",4,Fact : Incestuous Show about Two Gay Brothers,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,2983,"['really', 'think', 'gayest', 'show', 'television', 'right', 'now.There', 'even', 'video', 'homage', 'Youtube', 'un-subtle', 'sexual', 'tension', 'lead', 'actors', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'when', 'watched', 'Special', 'Features', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Day', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'was', 'clear', 'actors', 'had', 'eyes', 'one', 'other', 'hold', 'hands', 'go', 'piggy-back', 'riding', 'look', 'fondly', 'others', 'eyes', 'finish', 'others', 'sentences', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'doing', 'things', 'best', 'friend', 'only', 'did', 'things', 'person', 'was', 'relationship', 'Watch', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'just', 'sexual', 'tension', 'actors', 'so', 'palpable', 'would', 'take', 'only', 'most', 'stoic', 'fans', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'it.The', 'show', 'fine', 'effort', 'brothers', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'father', 'go', 'town', 'town', 'facing', 'increasingly', 'macabre', 'frightful', 'demons', 'monsters', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'vampire', 'one', 'especially', 'also', 'one', 'where', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'mental', 'asylum', 'go', 'crazy', 'supposed-to-be', 'scary', 'monsters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'found', 'huge', 'turn-off', 'However', 'smart', 'writing', 'boys', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'never-present', 'father', 'great', 'storyline', 'emotions', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'out.A', 'Hollywood', 'source', 'Jared', 'fansite', 'states', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'brothers', 'are', 'fact', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'other', 'Seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'struck', 'very', 'homoerotic', 'undertones', 'entire', 'series', 'actors', 'play', 'brothers', 'more', 'jilted', 'lovers', 'who', 'run', 'back', 'other', 'have', 'fight', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'body', 'language', 'particular', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'was', 'ever', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'fellow', 'actor', 'Jensen', 'one', 'seriously', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'slapped', 'few', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'get', 'over', 'with.Not', 'everyone', 'would', 'share', 'opinion', 'review', 'do', 'think', 'love', 'affair', 'lead', 'actors', 'fine', 'chemistry', 'documentary', 'only', 'screen', 'great', 'timing', 'in-sync', 'acting', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'particular', 'especially', 'good', 'when', 'dialogue', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'other', 'times', 'little', 'lost', 'directionless', 'fact', 'producers', 'attempts', 'pair', 'actors', 'off', 'women', 'episodes', 'look', 'very', 'forced', 'heterosexual', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'interesting.Its', 'funny', 'got', 'thinking', 'be', 'fine', 'horror/mystery', 'type', 'television', 'show', 'one', 'big', 'gay', 'lovefest', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'just', 'hope', 'tone', 'down', 'homoerotic', 'overtones', 'Season', '2', 'seriously', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'considering', 'two', 'leads', 'love', 'are', 'playing', 'brothers.Three', 'Stars']",N/A

Over the past 8 years I have introduced probably 3 dozen new fans to the Supernatural universe. To be frank, each season is different. The first two seasons of the show focuses more on monster of the week stories mixed in with family drama. However, once the show progresses the storylines add a great deal of character development, and give the character's lives purpose. The Winchester boys start out as young novice monster hunters to seasoned, professional monster hunters/heroes. In the more recent seasons you learn the truth about their lineage, the history of the Supernatural world, and lore about every kind of monster/demon/angel imaginable. In truth, some of the episodes are better than others. Not everyone will appreciate all of the storylines, especially about Heaven, Hell and Angels. Personally, it never bothered me.

993717,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000FP2OPY,Michael Butts,"[1, 3]","SUPERNATURAL has a lot going for it:  it is generally spooky, even though the storylines are derived from horror stories we've all seen before, but to the writers and directors credit, they are twisted enough to make them seem fresh again.  We get vampires, urban legends, Wendigos, witches, etc., and our heroes are stout warriors against them.  To reiterate the basic premise, Sam and Dean are brothers who are following in the footsteps of their supernatural investigator father in the quest to find the demon that killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend, while fighting various other horrors along the way.  Jared Padalecki is the sullen younger brother Sam, whose quest for a ""normal"" life ends with his lady's murder and his brother's insistence he join him in his quest to find their missing father.  Jensen Ackles is all dimple and macho bravado as Dean, the protective brother who is intent on dedicating his life to his demon demolishing.  While the actors are both adequate, there are times when their affectatious mannerisms grow tedious.  Also, their bickering and oneuppance get repetitious; there's not one episode where they're not arguing about something or differing on just what their goal in life is.  A little less focus on their bickering might have made the series episodes move a little tighter.  Anyway, this is one of the better horror series of recent television history and I did enjoy the first season...and it has a heck of a cliffhanger.

993718,A21HAN5XF6M22X,B000FP2OPY,Michael L. Emery,"[1, 1]","First of all, I only started watching this show in January of 2011, meaning the 6th season is currently airing and I have much to catch up on. I am halfway through season 2 right now, and for the most part really like it alot!Since this is a review of Season One, I will comment about that.The premise is interesting; two brothers, Sam and Dean, trained by their Father in hunting evil are searching for their missing Father who went missing during a ""hunt"", while handling evil shenanigans along the way. The characters are very likable...I especially like Dean because his sense of humor and behavior at times mirror my own. The brothers use various fake police/federal IDs to help them gather information about victims and such from local residents and authorities. Each episode is basically ""urban legand of the week"" but I feel it is done in ways that have not already been done to death. It's not until the last handful of episodes of the season that the true main storyline begins to be revealed...and it's an interesting one, in my opinion.Though some reviewers on here have said they find the acting wooden, and that Dean's behavior makes them question why anyone would believe he was a police officer/marshall/FBI Agent, etc, I have to disagree with these reviewers. I like the acting just fine; it's not over the top nor understanded, and they seem to actually feel the emotions they're expressing. And as for the believability of anyone buying that they are with the police/marshall/FBI, etc, I wonder if these reviewers are even watching the show, because many times they have gotten caught having lied about their credentials. Besides, most times the episodes take place in small towns, not big cities, so it's logical to assume that the townfolks and local authorities haven't had enough interactions with these branches of authorities to easily spot when someone's real or not.As for the quality of the stories themselves, they feel like nice mini-horror movies to me. And it's especially refreshing that the brothers are at times wrong or screw up, instead of being unrealistically spot-on all the time.The writing itself is nicely done, in my opinion, though a couple of times they tried to pull a fast one. For example.....{{{{SPOILER ALERT}}}}Near the end of ""Bugs"" Sam and Dean learn what's going on and rush to the home of the developer who unknowingly built homes on cursed land. According to the story, this is the last night of the curse, which ends at 6am. Sam and Dean arrived at the developer's home around midnight...yet despite the fact that bugs arrived at the home moments after Sam and Dean got there, only about 5 minutes or so passed until it was suddenly 6am and the bugs left. That's cheating, no matter how you try to explain it away.{{{{END OF SPOILER}}}}Since I believe that the music in a series adds emotion and sometimes power to a scene, the selection of classic rock songs is well placed! Amazingly, ALL THE MUSIC from the aired episodes are in these DVD episodes. That's incredible, considering how common it is for companies to replace the music with cheaper crap when releasing a series on DVD. So if you're a fan of classic rock, you'll get to enjoy the original tunes by the original artists!I was surprised how visually graphic they were on this show at times. I mean that in a ""WOAH! COOL!"" sort of way, I assure you. It just impressed me that for a network series they were allowed to show things I'd only expect to find on cable or an R-rated movie. Oh, and there's strong language at times...strong for a CW series, anyway. It's nothing that's done in every episode, it happens here and there.My only real gripe (other than my ""Bugs"" one) is that a few times things got predictable. Not in a ""eh, seen that done already"" but in a ""I suspected things long before it was confirmed."" It was not bad enough to turn me off from the series, obviously, however it did kind of take away from the enjoyment of the episodes where it happened. I'm an analytical person though, so perhaps it was just me.If you're a fan of Buffy, X-Files, Kolchek: The Night Stalker (original, not that crap they did a few years ago), or Friday The 13th: The Series, you'll probably like this show.If however, you're looking for ""Dawson's Creek with monsters"" pass on this...very little warm fuzzy moments on here.",4,Am hooked on this show...but...,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,4340,"['First', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'January', '2011', 'meaning', '6th', 'season', 'currently', 'airing', 'have', 'much', 'catch', 'up', 'am', 'halfway', 'season', '2', 'right', 'now', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'review', 'Season', 'One', 'will', 'comment', 'that.The', 'premise', 'interesting', 'two', 'brothers', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'trained', 'Father', 'hunting', 'evil', 'are', 'searching', 'missing', 'Father', 'who', 'went', 'missing', 'hunt', 'handling', 'evil', 'shenanigans', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'especially', 'Dean', 'sense', 'humor', 'behavior', 'times', 'mirror', 'own', 'brothers', 'use', 'various', 'fake', 'police/federal', 'IDs', 'help', 'gather', 'information', 'victims', 'such', 'local', 'residents', 'authorities', 'episode', 'basically', 'urban', 'legand', 'week', 'feel', 'done', 'ways', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'not', 'last', 'handful', 'episodes', 'season', 'true', 'main', 'storyline', 'be', 'revealed', 'interesting', 'one', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'said', 'find', 'acting', 'wooden', 'Dean', 'behavior', 'question', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'believe', 'was', 'police', 'officer/marshall/FBI', 'Agent', 'etc', 'have', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'acting', 'just', 'fine', 'not', 'top', 'understanded', 'seem', 'actually', 'feel', 'emotions', ""'re"", 'expressing', 'believability', 'anyone', 'buying', 'are', 'police/marshall/FBI', 'etc', 'wonder', 'reviewers', 'are', 'even', 'watching', 'show', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'gotten', 'caught', 'having', 'lied', 'credentials', 'Besides', 'most', 'times', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'towns', 'not', 'big', 'cities', 'logical', 'assume', 'townfolks', 'local', 'authorities', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'enough', 'interactions', 'branches', 'authorities', 'easily', 'spot', 'when', 'someone', 'real', 'not.As', 'quality', 'stories', 'feel', 'nice', 'mini-horror', 'movies', 'especially', 'refreshing', 'brothers', 'are', 'times', 'wrong', 'screw', 'up', 'instead', 'being', 'unrealistically', 'spot-on', 'time.The', 'writing', 'nicely', 'done', 'opinion', 'couple', 'times', 'tried', 'pull', 'fast', 'one', 'example', '..', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'end', 'Bugs', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'learn', 'what', 'going', 'rush', 'home', 'developer', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'built', 'homes', 'cursed', 'land', 'According', 'story', 'last', 'night', 'curse', '6am', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'arrived', 'developer', 'home', 'midnight', 'yet', 'fact', 'arrived', 'home', 'moments', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'got', 'there', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'passed', 'was', 'suddenly', '6am', 'bugs', 'left', 'cheating', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'explain', 'away', 'END', 'OF', 'SPOILER', 'believe', 'music', 'series', 'emotion', 'sometimes', 'power', 'scene', 'selection', 'classic', 'rock', 'songs', 'well', 'placed', 'Amazingly', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'aired', 'episodes', 'are', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'incredible', 'considering', 'how', 'common', 'companies', 'replace', 'music', 'cheaper', 'crap', 'when', 'releasing', 'series', 'DVD', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'classic', 'rock', ""'ll"", 'get', 'enjoy', 'original', 'tunes', 'original', 'artists', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'visually', 'graphic', 'were', 'show', 'times', 'mean', 'WOAH', 'COOL', 'sort', 'way', 'assure', 'just', 'impressed', 'network', 'series', 'were', 'allowed', 'show', 'things', ""'d"", 'only', 'expect', 'find', 'cable', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'Oh', 'strong', 'language', 'times', 'strong', 'CW', 'series', 'anyway', 'nothing', 'done', 'episode', 'here', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'other', 'Bugs', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'things', 'got', 'predictable', 'Not', 'eh', 'seen', 'done', 'already', 'suspected', 'things', 'long', 'was', 'confirmed', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'series', 'obviously', 'however', 'did', 'kind', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'episodes', 'where', 'happened', ""'m"", 'analytical', 'person', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'me.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Buffy', 'X-Files', 'Kolchek', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'original', 'not', 'crap', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'show.If', 'however', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'monsters', 'pass', 'very', 'little', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'moments', 'here']",N/A

Mostly because the bulk of the money and imagination was spent on the pilot before the networks decide to pick up certain shows.  If you're not a patient person, or really into the genre of this show then you probably won't be blown away.  It is worth the watch though, even if this is not your kind of show.  If for no other reason, simply because of the leads Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles.  The latter really is a truly gifted actor with mannerisms and a persona that really make his character of Dean believable.  Jared comes into his own as Sam also.  But watching for the different directors in each episode and their styles is also fun.  And once you begin to see where the creators and writers are taking you with the mythology of this series, you really get hooked.  It's because they somehow manage to make a weekly creature-feature and include the over-arching story line in every episode at the same time.

993741,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000FP2OPY,P. Hardy,"[0, 0]","At first glance (or rather after watching DIRECT-TV's WB Fall Sneak previews) SUPERNATURAL didn't strike me as something I would be interested in. I went as far as thinking it was the 'Buffy Replacement'. Any show I've watched, save MEDIUM, have been victims of Television Cancellation either by the first or second season. (I'm a broken record, I know, just bear with me here). My Mom and Dad were absolutely hyped about this show, yet another reason I wanted to dislike it, and decided to watch when it premiered. After the first and second episode premired, I decided to do the same having given it the benefit of the doubt. Sufficed to say I'm not ashamed to say that the ""Pilot"" episode did not fail to reel you in with its opening gambit.The Winchester Family (Mary, John, Dean, and Baby-Sam) are spending what seemed like a routine night together in the house, November 2nd 1982. However things go awry on a routine check on Sam. Mary Winchester, is found by her husband John on the ceiling right above their infant's crib. John is devistated and grief stricken by the tragedy that has fallen on his family. Fast forward 22 years later of the same date in 2005, Sam Winchester is now a senior student in Stanford University and living his desired 'normal' life without his remaining family. Of course his ideal lifestyle is brought to a serious halt when he comes face to face with his older brother Dean Winchester, caught lurking about in his dorm. Granted the neither man is happy to see the other for unforeseen reasons beyond a 'falling out' between the family. Instead of going over old wounds Dean request that his little brother come with him in his search for their Father, who has gone missing. Sam reluctantly agrees and follows his brother. Their fist case together is figuring how several missing people are connected to the urban legend of the Woman in White, Constance Whelch, who is connected to finding their father. From there the series goes from slightly lighthearted blending with an atmosphere  that is truly chilling and stumbles further into darkness that made ANGEL so popular.For starters I commend the creators for giving the audience a little insight on the Winchester family life before jumping 22-years-later into the lives of Dean and Sam Winchester. It gave you the sense of familiarity with the characters even if you didn't know them at all. The series Pilot was probably one of the better constructed PILOT-episodes I've seen for WB series. Adrianne Palicki (Kara of SMALLVILLE) as Sam's girlfriend was a nice little role, though I could hardly see the chemistry between herself and Jared, so I wasn't too broken up with her fate, though I could sympathize with Sam afterward. The ""Woman In White"" mytho as its foundation was nice. It lalso acked the necessary scare-factor that would otherwise have me saying, ""the ghost is in the car, run for your life Sam!"" Which is fine because the latter episodes pick up on the slack and give you an actual reason to shudder. The series itself is a marvel and should please even the most fans who BUFFY, The X-FILES, ANGEL. Early episodes (much like ""Bugs"" and ""Nightmare"") are set up in the 'Monster/Freak Of The Week' mannerisms but end up being little more than what is first concepted. Each episode's feature creature -- mentioned or shown -- has its own special little quirk based on myth behind it. Or its just completely made up. I especially liked the twist they used for the vampires in ""Dead Man's Blood"". The human guised villains (posessed or canibalistic), weren't crafted like the usual 'oversexed' (female-wise) villains that you'd seen in every other television series. Meg Masters is an especially interesting villian introduced in ""Scarecrow"". She behaved like a character more focused on achieving the mission and ridding herself of those who stood in her way.SEASON I slowly reveals the past of the brothers, their relationship, and their lives after the death of Mary along with the deteriorating relationship between themselves and John Winchester. The storyline for the series itself is superior to that of any series starting off in its first season, which is surprisingly becoming a trend among the sicence-fiction/supernatural shows. Granted the premise of two brothers searching for their missing father hardly seems like anything worth watching, but thankfully it doesn't focus entirely on this subplot, though its important. The humor, while sparse is amazingly funny (see ""Hell House"") and believable. Another thing worth mentioning is the reoccurring nameless 'DEMON'-story arc. This is the true hallmark of the series that will be nothing short of hard to rise above the realms of excellent story telling, especially with the way they left one hanging.It takes a while to get used to the Actors/Characters. At first, both brothers will be more than sure to irritate you. After a while you get used to their characterization. Jensen Ackles was just coming off of SMALLVILLE as Jason Teauge (the half baked-boyfriend of Lana Lang) and I had a hard time liking him as Dean Winchester. Jared Padalicki was hailing from GILMORE GIRLS, as Alexis Densisofts, so-called crazy boyfriend Dean Forester. That alone was reason to dislike him. It took a total of three episodes for me to get used to the actors and appreciate them. Nevertheless their acting is excellent and the two play off of each other quite well, thus creating a quirky onscreen chemistry that I never figured would come from either. Jensen as Dean, of course, turns out to be the more interesting Winchester brother. The brash, ever-cocky and overprotective brother who always proclaims to know best. He's always right even when he's not (he man enough to admit at times). If Dean had just been that, I probably would've gravitated more toward Sam. However, he is given much more depth which showcases Ackles dramatic acting quite well. Jared Padalicki as Sam is the usual ""prodigal son"" character that gripes about their father's manner of raising them as children (giving him a gun at the age of four-years didn't set well with him), his brother's so-called immaturity, undying loyalty to John, and John's obsession with finding ""The thing that killed Mom."" Thus the Winchester brother's relationship is put to the test through their constant conflicts of opinion. Other times both characters can be unbearably annoying to the point you want to shove a sock in their cakeholes. Jefrey Dean Morgan (JDM) as John Winchester took some time getting use to. As a warily regarded character of the series, John was someone who was hard not to hate -- especially with the way Sam regards him and the fact that his character is not seen again until ""Scarecrow."" Through flashbacks and later episodes you learn to understand John Winchester a little better than before, to the point you pity the man before you.The CGI in the series is much better than SMALLVILLE or CHARMED put together. Like LOST, it at least tries to put effort into little details like floating knives and the supernatural beings. However, like anything, it still shows the familiar irks that tells you a certain scene is computer generated (tch, duh). The original score reeks of the usual TV-esque styled composition if not just better composed than most. You'd notice If you really listened that much to the music going on in the background, which is few and far between the majority of the time. The real musical highlight is the decision to use CLASSIC ROCK songs as opposed to the typical status-quo use of Modern Artists to my great delight. From AC/DC, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Blue Oyster Cult, the majority of the licensed music from the 1970s and 1980s (and beyond) used is pretty good.[EPISODE LISTING]:01.01: Pilot - 3/501.02: Windigo - 3/501.03: Dead in the Water - 4/501.04: Phantom Traveler - 5/501.05: Bloody Mary - 3/501.06: Skin - 5/501.07: Hook Man - 3/501.08: Bugs - 3/501.09: Home - 3/501.10: Asylum - 4/501.11: Scarecrow - 4/501.12: Faith - 5/501.13: Route 666 - 3/501.14: Nightmare - 4/501.15: The Benders - 5/501.16: Shadow - 5/501.17: Hell House - 4/501.18: Something Wicked - 4/501.19: Provenance - 3/501.20: Dead Man's Blood - 4/501. 21: Salvation - 4501.22: Devil's Trap - 4/5Lastly, another hallmark of the show it the 1967 Chevy Impala otherwise known as the ""Metallicar"" by the fans. So all in all, SUPERNATURAL turns out to be another supernatural/thriller worth picking up and watching. It exceeds all expectations and lowers few. If you haven't already seen the this season, now's a great time to pick up. ----- [a 4 out of 5](Originally Written in 2006)",4,"And So It Begins ....

I did not know what to really expect, but in the end I ended up enjoying the show very much. At first it was a bit hard to get in to the show, but by the third or fourth episode I was hooked. The chemistry between the two brothers Dean and Sam is what makes this show so great. Dean has this cockiness and a funny charm that always lightens up the show, while Sam has this innocence all of which bring the show down to earth. At times I found myself jumping at the scary parts which is very rarely do with a TV series. The show has some scary episodes and has the feel of a movie to it which makes it that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend this great show to anyone who enjoys tales of urban legends or great old fashioned American folklore.",5,Supernatural is a great new show I highly recommend!,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,812,"['recently', 'completed', 'watching', 'entire', 'season', 'Supernatural', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'expect', 'end', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'get', 'show', 'third', 'fourth', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'chemistry', 'two', 'brothers', 'Dean', 'Sam', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'Dean', 'cockiness', 'funny', 'charm', 'always', 'up', 'show', 'Sam', 'innocence', 'bring', 'show', 'down', 'earth', 'times', 'found', 'jumping', 'scary', 'parts', 'very', 'rarely', 'do', 'TV', 'series', 'show', 'scary', 'episodes', 'feel', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'tales', 'urban', 'legends', 'great', 'old', 'fashioned', 'American', 'folklore']",N/A

Blending horror and family drama, the show has become a cult hit with a fiercely loyal fanbase. Unlike most recent series that dabbles in horror/supernatural/science fiction, ""Supernatural"" goes the route of ""The X-Files"", mainly comprised of stand alone stories with occasional mythology episodes, but unlike ""The X-Files"", the mythology is this show is fairly simple and won't get as complicated or confusing.I had been looking forward to this show for almost a year before it premiered, back when it was first announced that The WB was developing it. Fortunately the show turned out to be just as good as I thought it would, although it's not without it's flaws.The show stars Jensen Ackles (Dark Angel, Smallville) and Jared Padalecki (Gilmore Girls) as two adult brothers who are on a quest to find their missing father. Along the way they hunt down spirits, demons, and monsters, but this is nothing new to them: when they were children their mother was murdered by a demon and their father, hellbent on revenge, taught himself how to hunt and taught his children to do the same. Since, Sam had a falling out with his father and left to go to college, but his brother has pulled him back into this dangerous world of hunting.""Supernatural"" is a very fun, very entertaining series. It's not usually scary for me, nor will it be for those who have been exposed to the horror genre for many years, but the show does terrify many. You may be surprised at how effective and creepy the show can sometimes get, but overall the writers need to learn set up, and how to make things truly scary - psychological horror is often more effective than things jumping out at you, but the writers seem to forget that a lot. The other flaw is that Jared sometimes overacts his ""emotional"" scenes, and it's enough to make you roll your eyes.Overall, ""Supernatural"" is a great series. Creepy and stylish, it's bound to attract those who love ""The X-Files"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and other similar shows. And if you're a guy, like me, don't let the often misleading advertising or high number of tween fangirls fool you: this show is not your typical drama from The WB, and is written by a bunch of guys, and therefore is equally as appealing to male horror fans. During much of the season there also tends to be a ""beauty of the week"" that figures into the story, which sure didn't bother me.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",5,"Flawed, But Very Fun",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2642,"['Premiering', '2005-2006', 'season', 'WB', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'ever', 'network', 'merged', 'UPN', 'become', 'CW', 'Supernatural', 'proved', 'be', 'only', 'new', 'hit', 'network', 'would', 'have', 'Blending', 'horror', 'family', 'drama', 'show', 'become', 'cult', 'hit', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'fanbase', 'most', 'recent', 'series', 'horror/supernatural/science', 'fiction', 'Supernatural', 'route', 'X-Files', 'mainly', 'comprised', 'stand', 'alone', 'stories', 'occasional', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'X-Files', 'mythology', 'show', 'fairly', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'complicated', 'confusing.I', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'show', 'almost', 'year', 'premiered', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'WB', 'was', 'developing', 'Fortunately', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'would', 'not', 'flaws.The', 'show', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Smallville', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'two', 'adult', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'quest', 'find', 'missing', 'father', 'way', 'hunt', 'down', 'spirits', 'demons', 'monsters', 'nothing', 'new', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'mother', 'was', 'murdered', 'demon', 'father', 'hellbent', 'revenge', 'taught', 'how', 'hunt', 'taught', 'children', 'do', 'same', 'Sam', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'father', 'left', 'go', 'college', 'brother', 'pulled', 'back', 'dangerous', 'world', 'hunting', 'Supernatural', 'very', 'fun', 'very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'not', 'usually', 'scary', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'horror', 'genre', 'many', 'years', 'show', 'terrify', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'effective', 'show', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'writers', 'need', 'learn', 'set', 'up', 'how', 'make', 'things', 'truly', 'scary', 'psychological', 'horror', 'often', 'more', 'effective', 'things', 'jumping', 'out', 'writers', 'seem', 'forget', 'lot', 'other', 'flaw', 'Jared', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'enough', 'make', 'roll', 'eyes.Overall', 'Supernatural', 'great', 'series', 'Creepy', 'stylish', 'bound', 'attract', 'who', 'love', 'X-Files', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'other', 'similar', 'shows', ""'re"", 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'often', 'misleading', 'advertising', 'high', 'number', 'tween', 'fangirls', 'fool', 'show', 'not', 'typical', 'drama', 'WB', 'written', 'bunch', 'guys', 'therefore', 'equally', 'as', 'appealing', 'male', 'horror', 'fans', 'much', 'season', 'there', 'also', 'be', 'beauty', 'week', 'story', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'me.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre']",N/A

Blending horror, sci-fi, religious overtures, and dysfunction in the family, the show deserves a wider audience.Basically, even with its ""monster-of-the-week"" format, the show centers around the brothers Winchester and their quest to rid the country of demons, werewolves, and other little ""beasties.""  Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles are very good in their roles as the brothers, playing so well off each other that it's hard to not think that they are related.  The creators of the show have given Ackles - as the elder ""Dean"" - the chancee to be the more sardonic of the two, making a balance to Sam's (Padalecki) ""innocence.""If the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences weren't so biased against the fantasy/sci-fi genre, the two young men would've garnered ""Best Actor"" nominations for this landmark first season.The writers also place the pair in situations that rely on both their physical strength and mental acumen in order to defeat the things that go bump in the night, of which it seems that the country is plagued with.The show's Vancouver locations add to gloomy and dark story lines, although they are sometimes not quite as believable when trying to pass them off as mid-America.The third star of the show is the black 1967 Impala that transports the boys to their ""jobs.""  However, if the boys try to be inconspicuous, that car isn't the one to blend into the crowd.Also, the pair must have deep pockets in order to travel around the country, with no visible means of financial support.This compilation should win additional fans to a show that already has a devoted following...of which I am one.",5,"Who ya gonna call?

The show did a good job of delivering plenty of both aspects.While this season does have an episodic feel, I don't mind that as, without viewers posessing knowledge of the creatures and antagonist that Sam and Dean are trying to find, how else could this show get to 9 seasons now?Now I do have two slight issues with this season.

993751,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000FP2OPY,Robert Moore,"[12, 17]","I originally watched the first several episodes of SUPERNATURAL when it first came on, was not very impressed, and stopped watching. For reasons I won't go into, I decided to watch the first three seasons on DVD (and probably Season Four when it comes out on DVD in September). Rewatching the episodes of Season One that I had already seen and then watching the rest of the season really hasn't altered my assessment of the show. I like the two leads on the show and think they are fine, strong main characters. But that is pretty close to all that I can say good about the show. All in all, I think that this is a show that is limited by its rather strict adherence to its genre, it's close to near faithfulness to the standalone format, and its unwillingness to try new, bold things. I'll say more of this below. While I think there is more wrong with the show than there are things right about it, let me start off by saying what is rightI think SUPERNATURAL's greatest strength are Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Dean and Sam Winchester. I think most of the show's success with its group of fans has been based on the interplay between these two. They have great interpersonal chemistry and pretty much carry the show on their two shoulders. Some shows can work with less than ideal leads, but luckily SUPERNATURAL doesn't have that problem. The show's other great strength is the very high production values. The special effects are always superb and they do a great job of maintaining the fantasy. The show always has a great look with great art direction and make up. I've been a fan of a lot of Vancouver-based shows so watching this is a lot of fun for me because it is fun seeing locations used in countless other shows, not to mention the large stable of local Canadian actors. You can do a lot list of actors who have also been on SMALLVILLE or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or DARK ANGEL or JAKE 2.0 or THE 4400 or KYLE XY or EUREKA or what have you.As I watched Season One of SUPERNATURAL, I kept thinking of another show dealing with the supernatural, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. For whatever reason, TV critics (as opposed to its cult fans) have not found much fondness for SUPERNATURAL, in contrast to BUFFY, which was both a critics' darling and the most heavily studied show by academics in TV history. Why did one show dealing with the supernatural generate an immense amount of serious and in depth reflection, while this new one has not? Asked another way, although SUPERNATURAL has gained a substantial number of fans, definitely qualifying it as a cult show, why has it failed to gain even a small portion of the respect that BUFFY has enjoyed. In answering these questions, one gets to the heart of why I watch TV to begin with. Although I'm a huge fan of BUFFY, I'm not especially a fan of shows dealing with the supernatural. It isn't enough for me that a show deal decently with a certain kind of subject matter; the show has to be good regardless of its genre.BUFFY was a highly subversive show, mixing several genres and creating one of its own (BUFFY is usually credited with being the first Dramedy). Blending fantasy, comedy, drama, teen soap opera, and horror, it stretched all of those genres (not to mention recreating what it was possible to do on TV with very long story arcs), BUFFY was a truly revolutionary show, not to mention a brilliantly written one. BUFFY constantly shocked and surprised, always transcending one's expectations. In contrast - and this gets at the heart both of why I have had trouble truly enjoying SUPERNATURAL and why I think it has failed to garner any critical acclaim - SUPERNATURAL stays completing and safely within the confines of the fantasy/horror genre. It doesn't attempt to redefine what you can do with those genres and it doesn't push against the limitations of the genre. It is a safe, conservative show. And as such it is hard to see it exerting any influence on subsequent series. At the end of Season One I can honestly say that the show had not surprised or challenged me a single time.Closely connected to all this is the weakness of the writing. This comes out in a number of ways, such as the over simplicity of the narrative. In virtually every episode, the storytelling holds up only if you don't examine it very closely. There are dozens of questions that you can pose in any episode that they writers just slough over. There are all kinds of leaps of logic and fact and essential steps that are simply skipped. Let me give one example, pretty much at logic. In one episode a number of individuals have been killed by a killer truck, the reincarnation of another truck that had been deposited in a lake. A few minutes after expressing the need to look at this truck, we see them pulling the truck out of the lake. Questions the writers hope we won't ask: (1) Where did they get the tractor at such notice? (2) How did they learn to operate a tractor? (3) How did they locate the truck so quickly? (4) How did they attach the chain (and how did the chain manage to be long enough) without any apparent diving equipment? OK, all TV story telling requires occasional short cutting. Example: In BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Lee Adama gained a great deal of weight during the period when he was in charge of Pegasus while the humans were living on New Caprica. After the escape from New Caprica Lee remains very overweight for an episode, but then actor Jamie Bamber suddenly shed his fat suit and became the lean ripped person he had been before. Why? Creator Ron Moore says that they did this because watching Lee lose weight like that for half the season would be boring. He miraculously lost the weight because it led to better storytelling. It was a shortcut, but a shortcut for the greater good of the show. Now, one could argue that the endless shortcuts they take on each episode of SUPERNATURAL are shortcuts of the same kind. I could buy that if they were rare rather than commonplace. When shortcuts become as prevalent as they are on SUPERNATURAL, it is almost a mission statement. It is as if they've decided to ignore cogent, intelligent storytelling.The weakness of the writing also comes out in the simplistic way each story is told. We see a monster or demon and we pretty much instantly know what they are going to do. They kill their victims. There is a consistent linearity about this. We see a person. We see a demon/monster/possessed person. We see a death. For a show dealing with the supernatural, there is a shocking like of surprise on the show. The show almost always goes to the obvious. Contrast this with a show like FRINGE, where you can usually eliminate the most obvious solution.If you don't have a special affinity toward fantasy and horror, it isn't probable that you will like this show. If you do love the genre, this is likely to be something you will enjoy. I am neither especially interested in nor particularly repulsed by the genre. A show has to win me on its own merits. So I've found the show to be mildly entertaining, and I might even continue to watch it next year when it returns. But then again, I might not.",3,Good lead characters are hampered by weak standalone episodes and restrictions of genre,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,7131,"['originally', 'watched', 'first',

Along the way, the brothers find themselves hunting the very things that their father faced including popular urban legends, vampires, ghosts, and other paranormal monsters.A decidedly dark and grisly series, Supernatural appeals to a wide range of horror and thriller fans. Scary and violent, this series isn't for the faint of heart. Padalecki and Ackles are fantastic actors that are put in a shocking and bizarre situation each week, sometimes getting to play beyond their own characters.  Each episode is a nightmare/freak-of-the-week, full of heart-pounding suspense and chills. And the stunning visual effects are impressive for a television series.

This show definitely has a little bit of everything (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror etc.) to make it much more than just a 'genre' sci-fi/horror show.Season 1 seems very 'monster of the week' until you get into later seasons and realize that a lot of the stuff you learn in season 1 becomes important later on as well, so really its just the tip of a really awesome iceberg.The male leads (Jared Padalecki as Sam and Jensen Ackles as Dean) do an amazing job of carrying the full weight of the show, which is so unlike any other in the aspect that these two brothers travel across the country saving people from things beyond their comprehension. Unlike other shows where there's a steady ensemble cast to carry the storyline at times, it's typically just the Winchester brothers with the weight (and fate) of the world on their shoulders. The fact that they do what they do without getting paid (or thanked) only adds another layer of likability to them.I definitely recommend this show to everyone regularly and I've yet to have a friend or family member NOT like it after the first couple episodes.The best part?

Sam and Dean are true warriors trying to save humanity from a variety of supernatural scourages (ghosts, demons, evil creatures of all stripe)while searching for their dad. I particularly love the character Dean. Some of his lines are excellent: ""Dude you fugly..."" and ""Your, uh, half-caf, double-vanilla latte is gettin' cold over here, Francis."" Sam is great too, but his lines are less memorable because his character doesn't have Dean's snarky sense of humor.There are some episodes that are seriously creepy and may be too intense for young viewers (hence the TV14 rating), episode such as the Pilot, Provenance, and Asylum did make my skin crawl.I think my favorite episodes were Scarecrow, Route 666, Faith, and Devil's trap.

After wrapping up Season One this week, I think that I can say that I'm hooked. The bad news is that I've been missing out on a great TV show for the past 6 years. The good news is that I was able to watch the first season with no commercials and by owning it on DVD it took all of about two weeks to watch the entire set versus like 22 weeks watching it during the regular season.It's hard to believe that I actually purchased this (and Season 2) two years ago at the recommendation of a friend but waited this long to finally get around to trying the show out. I got Seasons 1 & 2 for under 20 bucks each here at Amazon and that was a great deal because I see that they're a lot more expensive today, and the Blu Ray editions are like more than 3 times what I paid two years ago. Anyway....Supernatural is likeTales from the Cryptwith the major difference being that it's the same lead characters in each episode. Brothers Sam & Dean Winchester are led to or look for strange stories to investigate that could involve something supernatural. Ghosts, monsters, demons, things not of this world, and sometimes just creeps...the Winchester brothers take on all comers. And the result is approximately 42 minutes of spookytime in each episode that will send chills down your spine and often have you jumping out of your seat.Some of the stories will seem familiar and are predictable...sometimes the stories are deliberately familiar and predictable. Either way, out of 22 episodes in the first season, I can think of perhaps only one, maybe two, where there was a ""meh"" kind of ending versus being thoroughly entertained by the rest of the episodes in the set.I hope someone got rewarded for casting Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles together; their chemistry is real and entertaining. (Someone should also get a reward for making sure that some new hot girl is always inserted into each episode.) Another reward should go to whoever picks the soundtrack for the episodes.The Season 1 DVD set has only Dolby Stereo sound, but I see on the Season 2 DVD case that Dolby 5.1 becomes an option. Sweet music to my ears. And now you can get all the seasons on Blu Ray which wasn't an option back in 2008 when I originally purchased Season 1. So onto my Wish List they go, and here's hoping that I'll see the subsequent Blu Ray seasons on sale before I need to buy them, because I will indeed need to buy them once I finish Season 2; as I said earlier: I'm hooked.Highly recommended.",4,Ghost Stories,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2600,"['Just', 'box', 'Supernatural', 'Season', 'One', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packed', 'show', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'times', 'wrapping', 'up', 'Season', 'One', 'week', 'think', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'bad', 'news', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missing', 'out', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'past', '6', 'years', 'good', 'news', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'commercials', 'owning', 'DVD', 'took', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'watch', 'entire', 'set', 'versus', '22', 'weeks', 'watching', 'regular', 'season.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'actually', 'purchased', 'Season', '2', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'waited', 'long', 'finally', 'get', 'trying', 'show', 'got', 'Seasons', '1', '2', '20', 'bucks', 'here', 'Amazon', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'see', ""'re"", 'lot', 'more', 'expensive', 'today', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'editions', 'are', 'more', '3', 'times', 'what', 'paid', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Anyway', '.Supernatural', 'likeTales', 'Cryptwith', 'major', 'difference', 'being', 'same', 'lead', 'characters', 'episode', 'Brothers', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'are', 'led', 'look', 'strange', 'stories', 'investigate', 'could', 'involve', 'something', 'supernatural', 'Ghosts', 'monsters', 'demons', 'things', 'not', 'world', 'sometimes', 'just', 'creeps', 'Winchester', 'brothers', 'take', 'comers', 'result', 'approximately', '42', 'minutes', 'spookytime', 'episode', 'will', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'often', 'have', 'jumping', 'seat.Some', 'stories', 'will', 'seem', 'familiar', 'are', 'predictable', 'sometimes', 'stories', 'are', 'deliberately', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'way', '22', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'think', 'perhaps', 'only', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'where', 'was', 'meh', 'kind', 'ending', 'versus', 'being', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'rest', 'episodes', 'set.I', 'hope', 'someone', 'got', 'rewarded', 'casting', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'together', 'chemistry', 'real', 'entertaining', 'Someone', 'should', 'also', 'get', 'reward', 'making', 'sure', 'new', 'hot', 'girl', 'always', 'inserted', 'episode', 'reward', 'should', 'go', 'whoever', 'soundtrack', 'episodes.The', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'only', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'sound', 'see', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'case', '5.1', 'becomes', 'option', 'Sweet', 'music', 'ears', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'seasons', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'was', ""n't"", 'option', 'back', '2008', 'when', 'originally', 'purchased', 'Season', '1', 'So', 'Wish', 'List', 'go', 'here', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'see', 'subsequent', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'seasons', 'sale', 'need', 'buy', 'will', 'indeed', 'need', 'buy', 'once', 'finish', 'Season', '2', 'said', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'hooked.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I have watched every episode of the first season on The WB(soon to be called The CW). Its about two brothers named Sam and Dean. They have lost contact with their father and they go and search for him, one day when Sam comes home after a long weekend with his brother he feels that something is just not right, he goes into his room and realizes that his girlfriend, Jessica is dead. He gets so freaked out and he wants to know what happened to his girlfriend. So Sam and Dean go on a very long road trip stopping in various towns with strange things going on and stop it. In the end they always win.The shows writers have used classic urban legends like Mary, Bloody Mary and The Scarecrow as well as a bunch of their own. Its really cool. I'm glad to know that they have renewed the show for another season and I just cant wait to watch the season premiere, last season left a big cliffhanger. This show is really cool for horror buffs.

993785,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000FP2OPY,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","When Supernatural premiered on the CW Network in 2005, fans couldn't have dreamed it would ever last five seasons.  In fact, series creator Eric Kripke had originally planned to end the show after the fifth season but the ratings had been so good that the CW wanted a sixth season.  As one of the very few true horror shows on TV that doesn't (thankfully) feature vampires, Supernatural has become must-see TV as we've watched the two stars Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) and Jared Padelecki (Sam Winchester) transform from fresh-faced and wide-eyed young men, to hardened, battle-weary monster-hunters who've dealt with the tragic losses of nearly everyone who is close to them.Warner Brothers has released the first season of Supernatural, all 22 episodes on Blu-Ray, complete with two new bonus features exclusive to this set.  The pilot episode relates the story of their mother Mary being killed by a demonic force when Sam was still an infant.  Years later, Sam is off at college and estranged brother Dean arrives to tell Sam their father, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has disappeared.  Dean has his father's journal and hopes to use it to track him down but Sam is reluctant, wanting no part of this wandering, demon-hunting lifestyle.  But when Sam's girlfriend is killed in the same way as his mother, he is left with little choice.  Kripke gets the show off to a high-energy and terrifying start.  These guys may be ""slayers"" but this show was no Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Supernatural was raw and edgy from the beginning combing its horror elements with the strained relationship of the brothers.Much of the first season is spent looking for their father and encountering various monsters, demons, and spirits along the way.  What kept the show fresh and still keeps it fresh to this day is that it wasn't about hunting exclusively demons, or vampires...The boys hunted those down but also all manner of spirits, creatures of myth, cursed objects, and urban legends.  One of these urban legends was encountered in episode five, ""Bloody Mary"".  Here the boys take on the vengeful spirit who is summoned when her name is uttered three times in front of a mirror.The writers showed how they drew on myths both well known and obscure in episodes like ""Scarecrow"" where a spirit of Norse mythology is being summoned in the form of a scarecrow to protect the town in exchange for annual sacrifices.  It is during ""Scarecrow"" that they first encounter Meg Masters who will become one of the early recurring villains during the early run of the show.  In ""Faith"" they have their first encounter with a Reaper, spirits who are the underlings of Death, that come to claim the spirits of those who have died.  They also have a run-in with a haunted house in episode 17, ""Hell House"".In the final episodes of Season One, they will finally track down both their father, and the demon that killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend, culminating in a jarring season-ending cliffhanger.  In the season finale we also meet fellow hunter Bobby Singer who will become a semi-regular over the entire series run.Another aspect that makes the show unique is that they are always on the road, spanning the entire nation and ending up in primarily small towns throughout the USA.  Saginaw, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; Hibbing, Minnesota; Rockford, Illinois...It was pretty cool if an episode was set in your town or one close by.  As the guys drive from town to town in Dean's classic 1967 Chevy Impala, the show treated us to a diversified selection of classic rock.  It's rumored that Kripke threatened to quit the show when the network refused to allow the music to be used because of the cost of royalties.The show quite easily could have become a mundane, monster-of-the-week battle but the show's writers managed to keep the storylines constantly invigorated with new sub-plots, characters, and a liberal injection of satire and often gut-busting humor.  The sixth season may be the last but we can always relive this fantastic show on DVD or Blu-Ray.Blu-Ray Special FeaturesFirst lets cover the special features that were on the previous DVD release.  There are two audio commentary tracks on the ""Pilot"" by Series Creator Eric Kripke, Director David Nutter and Producer Peter Johnson, and on ""Phantom Traveler"" by Co-Stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles.Supernatural Tales from the Edge of Darkness (23:00) A behind-the-scenes look at season one and how creator Eric Kripke was influenced by his love of urban legends.  Takes a look at creating the pilot episode in which the boy's father was originally intended to be killed.Day in the Life of Jared and Jensen (10:37).  The two stars take you through an average day on the set.  Much of it is spent simply passing time and waiting to be called to the set.  Jensen practices his knife throwing in his trailer.  Finally they are called and go first to makeup and then to costuming before going to the set for filming.Gag Reel (7:40)Deleted Scenes:  There are numerous deleted scenes that are specific to episodesNew Features:  OK to what you really want to know is what is new to the blu-ray version, right?  Well probably not enough to make you buy it if you already own the first season on DVD but the two new extras are very good.Paley Television Festival Panel Discussion (1:12:00)  This hour plus feature was shot during the Paley Television Festival after the first season.  Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles are joined on stage by Eric Kripke, Director/Producer the late Kim Manners, and Executive Producer Robert Singer.  They do a Q & A session with the fans in attendance.  Kripke mentions how his original pitch was about a reporter but was too similar to the old Kolchak: The Nightstalker series.  The actors discuss their auditions, favorite episodes, and some of the creepy events that happened on set.Devil's Road Map:  Even better is this very cool interactive map of the U.S. showing the location where each season episode took place.  Clicking on each location will bring up all new interviews with cast members, writers, and producers about that specific episode.  You can also click on each city to learn more about local legends and urban myths from that region.  In all this feature includes about 90 additional minutes of interviews.",5,SEASON 1 FINALLY ON BLU-RAY,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,6311,"['When', 'Supernatural', 'premiered', 'CW', 'Network',

993787,A1IOGEZUZPII8C,B000FP2OPY,travels10,"[0, 0]",I LOVE this show.  It's the story about 2 brothers Sam and Dean on a road trip across America hunting paranormal.  They are searching for answers re: the death of their mother 22 years prior and the death of Sam's girlfriend Jessica and they're searching for the whereabouts of their missing father.

I assumed that it was silly teenager entertainment with handsome, but vapid leads, and I most certainly was not in the target demographic.  Then when it moved from the WB to the CW, I congratulated myself on my good judgment and ignored the subsequent seasons.Then a bunch of my internet buddies, some of whom were also X-Files fans, started praising the show and urging me to try it, and I just shook my head.  ""Not my thing"", I said.  But the recommendations continued through Seasons 2 and 3, and then suddenly, my LJ flist went into raptures over the introduction of a new character in the 4th season.  ""Hmmmm"", I thought.  ""I suppose I could give the first season a try.""So I bought the first season on DVD, and it sat in my To Be Viewed pile for months.  Then, one boring winter Saturday, I popped the first disc in the DVD play and watched the first season straight through.  ""Well, hell"", I thought. ""This is *exactly* my kind of thing.""  And I proceeded to, within two months, watch the next three seasons on DVD.It's a great little show.  Clever, scary, full of archetypes and folklore and interesting twists on classic urban legends.  The leads, Jared and Jensen, are darling, and the dynamic between the brothers is charming and funny and totally believable.  Both actors develop and hone their acting chops over the subsequent seasons, but Jensen, in particular, becomes a particularly compelling performer to watch.  He reminds me a lot of Ben Browder.  I am convenced that, had he not been on a Sci Fi Network genre television show, Ben would have been nominated and possibly won an Emmy for his work in the second and third seasons of ""Farscape"".I feel the same way about Jensen's work in Season 2 of SPN.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.This first season of SPN has the usual fits and starts of a premiere season, but the seeds of so much of what unfolds in later seasons are sowed in these first episodes that I can almost guarantee that after you make your way through the remaining seasons on DVD--and you will--it won't be long before you pop the first season DVDs into the player, just so you can go back and retrace the origins of the later arcs.Highly recommended.",5,"I'll admit it, freely and without shame.",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2281,"['being', 'fan', 'X-Files', 'completely', 'blew', 'series', 'when', 'premiered', 'assumed', 'was', 'silly', 'teenager', 'entertainment', 'handsome', 'vapid', 'leads', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'target', 'demographic', 'Then', 'when', 'moved', 'WB', 'CW', 'congratulated', 'good', 'judgment', 'ignored', 'subsequent', 'seasons.Then', 'bunch', 'internet', 'buddies', 'whom', 'were', 'also', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'started', 'praising', 'show', 'urging', 'try', 'just', 'shook', 'head', 'Not', 'thing', 'said', 'recommendations', 'continued', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'then', 'suddenly', 'LJ', 'flist', 'went', 'raptures', 'introduction', 'new', 'character', '4th', 'season', 'Hmmmm', 'thought', 'suppose', 'could', 'give', 'first', 'season', 'try', 'So', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'sat', 'Be', 'Viewed', 'months', 'Then', 'one', 'boring', 'winter', 'Saturday', 'popped', 'first', 'disc', 'DVD', 'play', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'straight', 'Well', 'hell', 'thought', '*exactly*', 'kind', 'thing', 'proceeded', 'two', 'months', 'watch', 'next', 'three', 'seasons', 'DVD.It', 'great', 'little', 'show', 'Clever', 'scary', 'full', 'archetypes', 'folklore', 'interesting', 'twists', 'classic', 'urban', 'legends', 'leads', 'Jared', 'Jensen', 'are', 'darling', 'dynamic', 'brothers', 'charming', 'funny', 'totally', 'believable', 'actors', 'develop', 'hone', 'acting', 'chops', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Jensen', 'particular', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'performer', 'watch', 'lot', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'am', 'convenced', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Network', 'genre', 'television', 'show', 'Ben', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'possibly', 'won', 'Emmy', 'work', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'Farscape', '.I', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Jensen', 'work', 'Season', '2', 'SPN', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.This', 'first', 'season', 'SPN', 'usual', 'fits', 'starts', 'premiere', 'season', 'seeds', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'unfolds', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'sowed', 'first', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'make', 'way', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'pop', 'first', 'season', 'DVDs', 'player', 'just', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'retrace', 'origins', 'later', 'arcs.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

993795,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000FP2OPY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 2]","REVISED FOR BLU-RAY RELEASE:THE ORGININAL DVD RELEASE:The best horror show since ""The X-Files"" is a witty, clever series which will keep you glued to your seat. Dean and Sam Winchester hunt monsters. After the death of their mother at the hands of a mysterious poltergeist like spirit their father begins a life long obsession with hunting down and destroying the creature that killed his wife. He also hunts other creatures that prey on humanity. When he disappears his son Dean (Jenson Ackles)recruits his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki)to help find their father. In the process they end up hunting supernatural creatures along the way kicking their butts.The actors have terrific on-screen chemistry. I wondered how the show could come up with fresh material given that this show was preceded by the 70's series ""Kolchak"" (and before that the superior TV movies), ""The X-Files"" and ""Night Stalker"" but the producers and writers always manage to come up with fresh angles for the episodes. The show does have occasional cursing (for those that have small kids) and might be too scary for some kids but it's a great show to watch for everyone else.The DVD looks terrific with extras such as commentary (on the pilot and one other episode) as well as deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes featurettes about the actors and the production of the show. Some stores feature additional extras for example Best Buy has an exclusive disc focusing on ""Supernatural at The Museum of Television & Radio Paley Television Fesvital"" where the stars, creator/writer Eric Kripke and producers Kim Manners & John Shiban (""The X-Files"") (as well as other producers on the show)discuss the creation, evolution and production of the series. They also answer those burning questions for fans...like why all the 70's rock music (AC/DC and others are featured in the show).  They also discuss the inspiration for the show (""The X-Files"" among them not surprisingly) and changes that occurred from the pitch to production. Don't forget to take a look at the DVD-ROM features which allows you to visit a secret website, see a video of creator Eric Kripke discussing the first draft of the pilot script and where you read/print up the pilot script as well. You can also gain access to the car (and the trunk using a combination code as well for all the weapons beneath the cover).FOR THE BLU-RAY:The Blu-ray has two features that weren't on the original regular DVD edition. The ""Supernatural at the Museum of Television and Radio"" featurette has been added to ALL Blu-ray editions (it wasn't only available on certain DVD editions). There's also a ""Roadmap"" that takes you to all the of the locations for the first season episodes providing you with information on the legends.Image quality for the Blu-ray is quite strong with nice detail and a sharper more vibrant picture. For the money, it's a good upgrade or first time investment if you haven't seen the show in HD. Be aware that the show is deliberately grainy looking which is the style that the producers chose for the show. Also, the washed out colors of the show in this presentation is characteristic of the series and a stylistic choice.Regardless of whether you purchase the show on DVD or Blu-ray, ""Supernatural"" is an entertaining horror series and it wasn't until about 1/3 of the way through the season when the writers/producers retooled the structure of the show to focus much more on the characters. Creator Eric Kripke realized that the stars of the show had unqiue and strong on screen chemistry which made their performances as brothers believable. As the series progresses you'll notice sometimes that the creatures themselves (outside of the teasers) sometimes don't appear until midway thorugh an episode.

993796,A2USTECHX1PKVA,B000FP2OPY,"Weedwacker ""I'm a doctor of STEW.""","[5, 9]","I borrowed this dvd set from a friend after remembering that a lady I work with had told me once that it was so scary that she and her step-daughter had to turn it off (which I did not take to heart since this same woman was scared to go outside after watching the movie Van Helsing!).While this show is fun and yes, she was right, truly creepy at times, I have not been hooked the way most avid fans seem to be.  In general it is a bit too contrived, predictable and formulaic for me to hang on desperately for the next episode.  While I do like Jared Padalecki I have yet to be impressed by Jensen Ackles in any way.  I like Padalecki because of other work I have seen him do but even so the two cookie-cutter leads are just presented a little too much like men who have walked off the cover of a GQ magazine (in fairness, this is not really their fault).I think the reason I do not feel compelled to watch the show beyond the set I have borrowed is because I know that I can easily miss a few episodes and not truly have missed anything as far as the paper-thin running storyline goes which is bad because ultimately I don't care what happens to any of the characters and therefore I have no reason to want to tune in unless I have nothing better to do.  The very reason I am not addicted to the show is also an element that is not entirely bad.  Even if I had missed episodes here and there I CAN still tune in for an episode and enjoy it without frustration for the creepy atmosphere and solved-within-an-hour story of the week (please don't misunderstand this statement--I have watched the entire season, I am simply saying that looking back I certainly would not have had to see each episode in order to keep up with the goings on).The negatives:  The show suffers a bit in terms of the writing and the acting.  At first I forgave both because being a new series it is normal for it to be a bit rough at first, but as I continued to watch neither of these things improved much.  While this is not a show I feel is meant to be taken too seriously I still find the exposition in each episode to be nearing the side of ridiculousness.  I understand it is necessary but I also believe that better writers could find a way to pull it off in a less obvious manner.As far as the acting, a lot of the guest stars and one-episode characters are portrayed terribly and some are okay, even good.  My main issue with the acting is with Jensen Ackles.  While I understand that Padalecki is by no means some great actor I find him to be far more believable than Ackles, despite the opposite opinion that most Supernatural fans seem to hold.  I have actually laughed out loud many times upon Ackles' deliverance of lines and body language that are clearly supposed to be deadly serious but really just come off as silly and as though he doesn't even believe it.  Half the time it looks like he was trained at an acting school that teaches people how to act with nothing more than their eyebrows (think Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell in ""Miami Vice"") except he purses his lips as well.  I keep waiting for him to say anything I can believe but sadly it has not happened yet.  I haven't seen anything beyond the first season, so maybe something has changed.The positives:  Where the show excels is atmosphere, setting and its soundtrack!  As I said early on, Supernatural is definitely creepy beyond any show I have seen on television and there have been times when I decided one episode was enough for the day because I can only take raised hackles for so long.  The sets are always well done and effective and the effects and makeup are also great, especially for TV.  If they could just transfer a bit of that effort into the writing and acting I think this show would be far better than it is.The music choices are refreshing and fun and while the songs played almost don't even seem to make sense given the age range of the target audience and style of the show they have been from some of my favorites (like Rush!) and I think add to the feel of it all.So, while this show is not the best out there by any means it is pretty unique and has potential, although I have to wonder whether that potential will ever be met since up to this point the flaws have not been fixed.Something has to be said for Supernatural's popularity as well.  What that something is...I am not sure.  Let's just say I almost felt the need to give a disclaimer at the beginning of my review to advise others that the review contains my own opinions which may be offensive to big Supernatural fans.  The following statements do not apply to every last Supernatural fan, so please don't take it that way, I know not everyone is like this.  That being said, a lot of the fan base for Supernatural seem to be almost cult-like in their love for this show, referring to Padalecki and Ackles as Jared and Jensen, like they know them personally and call them at home and even congratulating me on finally becoming one of them since I have seen the show finally.  WOW!  As you can see by looking on almost any site where there is discussion of the show the mentality is that this is THE best show ever made and anyone who does not agree that this is the ""best show ever"" is ripped to shreds--even here on Amazon, a specific looney toon goes to each negative review and writes a bunch of insane comments, even casts curses or ""spells"" on anyone who does not like the show.  Ah, to be 13 years old.  I am sure I will receive negative, childish comments about my review as well because it is not glowing and dares to mention flaws and *GASP* includes opinions that do not fall in line with die hard fans of Supernatural.

993797,A2A60Y2HTOTNSX,B000FP2OPY,yourlibrarian,"[1, 1]","While the series pilot had a plothole or two, on the whole it was a good introduction to the world of the Winchesters, a family of ghost and demon hunters who got into the business after a family tragedy. It also introduces us to the style of the series, and some continuing storylines involving family conflict, monsters of the week, their family's long running hunt for a mysterious killer, and Sam and Dean learning to deal with one another as brothers and hunting partners.The first season is rather uneven, focusing largely on cases the brothers find themselves on, with bits of family history woven in during the early episodes. Around midseason however the larger family arc starts kicking in and the season closes with several strong episodes where some long awaited issues get addressed and the final scenes lead to one of the strongest season cliffhangers around. You'll definitely want to start watching S2 once you get to the end.There are numerous deleted scenes here, marked by scissors icons on each episode they belong to.  Viewers also have the option of turning off the introductory recaps that are attached to each episode, (although one may want to keep the one for the season finale).  There are also some enjoyable commentaries, although one could have hoped for more, especially since they are for early episodes.  There are also some entertaining documentary features and, of course, the gag reel.

At first I was a bit cynical as there had been many other shows that had tried the supernatural angle and failed, but this series has been a surprising hit. The storylines are always compelling, and a mixture of ghostly phenomena, apparitions, and even urban myths. The acting is well above average. We have the older Winchester brother played excellently by Jensen Ackles, and the younger brother Sam, played by Gilmore Girls alum, Jared Padalecki. Both characters portray their struggles & inner conflicts really well, and the two main leads share a genuine on-screen chemistry, making us sympathise with their plight in trying to locate their father.There is also a unique quality to this series...the dark storylines juxtaposed with the humor & wit contained within the dialogues...it makes for enjoyable viewing every episode!",4,A compelling series on the paranormal,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,890,"['Supernatural', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'cynical', 'had', 'been', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'had', 'tried', 'supernatural', 'angle', 'failed', 'series', 'been', 'surprising', 'hit', 'storylines', 'are', 'always', 'compelling', 'mixture', 'ghostly', 'phenomena', 'apparitions', 'even', 'urban', 'myths', 'acting', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'have', 'older', 'Winchester', 'brother', 'played', 'excellently', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'younger', 'brother', 'Sam', 'played', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'alum', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'characters', 'portray', 'struggles', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'really', 'well', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'share', 'genuine', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'making', 'sympathise', 'plight', 'trying', 'locate', 'father.There', 'also', 'unique', 'quality', 'series', 'dark', 'storylines', 'juxtaposed', 'humor', 'wit', 'contained', 'dialogues', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'episode']",N/A
