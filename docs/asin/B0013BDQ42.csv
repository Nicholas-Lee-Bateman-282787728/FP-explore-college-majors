It continues to draw from the headlines of today's CNN/BBC News formats with thoroughly believable storylines addressing intra-government power struggles, African nationalism, fanatical terrorist, religious fundamentalism, and espionage that is pitch perfect. The superior ensemble cast alas, is whittled down from the original team, loosing long-time computer/techno geek Rory MacGregor and the lovely and loyal Ruth Evershed.  All that remains of the original crew is in command, staid Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) whose bittersweet office romance with Ruth is shafted as it falters.  Widower Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones) is at studly top form showing off both his weakened single state to the young nanny as well as a nice backside, but his travails strain both mental and physical talents as Adam must lead his new team into the fray.  The addition of a new team member Ros Myers adds ying to Adam's yang and their clashes are both head to head and more so.If any series is to be owned, MI-5 is the one to own.

1140456,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,B0013BDQ42,"Gabriela Perez ""Oy! So many books. . . .""","[17, 22]","(Note: spoilers for previous season and this one may pop up in the following review.)When the last season ended, Adam (Rupert Penry Jones) had been injured when an ex-5 agent went on a shooting spree. As this season begins, Adam goes through a very quick (on-screen, anyway) recovery after almost dying on the operating table.  He might be back at work, but his spirit is definitely damaged. Last season, his wife was killed (she died in his arms) and he now faces the prospect of raising his son alone.Then, of course, he is shot. He later witnesses the unprovoked shooting of a woman he is trying to keep safe (she was basically put at risk as a part of an operation Adam was running). It is all too much for him, and we watch him come apart this season. Penry-Jones is superb here, maintaining that steely determination while he balances on a razor's edge of near-hysteria. He suffers through nightmares, stumbles around almost zombie-like at times, and basically disconnects himself from reality at various turns, and Penry-Jones does an excellent job of showing that process.Other actors are superb as well, most notably the one who plays Roz. She is a new addition to the team, having been brought in after her father is revealed as a very bad guy.This season deals with a variety of issues, including the erosion of civil liberties (an issue here in the States as well as in the UK), the threat of nuclear proliferation (the US is a bit of a bad guy here), and cover-ups on the part of different agencies. All the episodes are gripping and even educational.Excellent season.

1140459,A27SCKSXFTAS2S,B0013BDQ42,G. Waldhauser,"[1, 3]","The MI5 series started as a no-nonsense series with spooks able to deal with all kinds of situations. But as the series continues, and especially in the 5th season, it becomes politically correct to modern standards. Suddenly the officers don't carry arms anymore, or at least very seldom, and the enemies are sought more within the British system than outsides, especially in the Arab and/or Muslim world. There is less violence than in the beginning, and there is more ""let's talk about it"" atmosphere. Very disappointing. But the situation changes if suspected Israeli agents come into play. Suddenly they are the bad guys, suddenly they are more violent than any other counterpart MI5 encountered in the last 4 seasons and suddenly the SAS, when storming an embassy (again) can shoot straight. Of course they shoot the Israelis, even when they are on the ground, numb from an explosion. You wouldn't (and haven't) see this when it comes to Muslim terrorists. But as it's only Israelis, nobody cares.Oh, and yes, of course, in this seasons more than ever before the Americans are the bad and stupid ones, and the spooks of her Majesty are of course, although outnumbered and out-resourced, the heroes.Rather cheap and disappointing. Another thing is that after politics economic powers took over: I appreciated the car diversity in this series - Peugeot, Lexus, Renault, Jaguar, LAnd Rover ... all kind of cars. Since season 5 the Volkswagen Group took over, and Harry switches to Audi, Ruth to SEAT, the SAS arrives in a VW van, and even the Israeli ambassador drives a Porsche (which no Israeli ambassador I know would do). It is a pitty. I strongly reconsider buying the following seasons.So, for all the viewers who would like to see unarmed far-from-reality agents acting politically correct, bashing Americans and Israelis - go and watch MI5. For those who liked the first three seasons - don't continue to season 5. Keep the good memory of the first seasons.",2,disappointing decrease in quality,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,1968,"['MI5', 'series', 'started', 'no-nonsense', 'series', 'spooks', 'able', 'deal', 'kinds', 'situations', 'series', 'especially', '5th', 'season', 'politically', 'correct', 'modern', 'standards', 'Suddenly', 'officers', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'arms', 'anymore', 'least', 'very', 'seldom', 'enemies', 'are', 'sought', 'more', 'British', 'system', 'outsides', 'especially', 'Arab', 'and/or', 'Muslim', 'world', 'less', 'violence', 'beginning', 'more', 'let', 'talk', 'atmosphere', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'situation', 'changes', 'suspected', 'Israeli', 'agents', 'come', 'play', 'Suddenly', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'suddenly', 'are', 'more', 'violent', 'other', 'counterpart', 'MI5', 'encountered', 'last', '4', 'seasons', 'suddenly', 'SAS', 'when', 'storming', 'embassy', 'again', 'can', 'shoot', 'straight', 'course', 'shoot', 'Israelis', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'ground', 'numb', 'explosion', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'only', 'Israelis', 'nobody', 'cares.Oh', 'yes', 'course', 'seasons', 'more', 'ever', 'Americans', 'are', 'bad', 'stupid', 'ones', 'spooks', 'Majesty', 'are', 'course', 'outnumbered', 'out-resourced', 'heroes.Rather', 'cheap', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'politics', 'economic', 'powers', 'took', 'appreciated', 'car', 'diversity', 'series', 'Peugeot', 'Lexus', 'Renault', 'Jaguar', 'LAnd', 'Rover', 'kind', 'cars', 'season', '5', 'Volkswagen', 'Group', 'took', 'over', 'Harry', 'Audi', 'Ruth', 'SEAT', 'SAS', 'VW', 'van', 'even', 'Israeli', 'ambassador', 'Porsche', 'Israeli', 'ambassador', 'know', 'would', 'do', 'pitty', 'strongly', 'reconsider', 'buying', 'following', 'seasons.So', 'viewers', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'unarmed', 'far-from-reality', 'agents', 'acting', 'politically', 'correct', 'bashing', 'Americans', 'Israelis', 'go', 'watch', 'MI5', 'who', 'liked', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'continue', 'season', '5', 'Keep', 'good', 'memory', 'first', 'seasons']",MI-5: Vol. 5
1140460,A22ZVE83UJ6YGT,B0013BDQ42,Jack  Levic,"[2, 2]","MI-5 just continues to grab my attention. I was excited about Season 5 to find out what happened to Adam after he was hit by a sniper in last season's cliffhanger. Let's say the cliffhanger is resolved in seconds in the premiere episode. Quickly, MI-5 is back in motion with an emotionally crippled Adam. Adam's lingering psychological problems over his near death experience and the loss of his beloved wife in a botched mission last season become an ongoing threat to the efficiency and safety of MI-5 through the following episodes and his colleagues begin to question his judgement.I started to feel the show was losing a bit of steam midway through the season. If it's not the Islamic terrorist, it's people pretending to be Islamic terrorists, or various terrorists trying to outdo the Islamic terrorists. One episode did feature Christian terrorists trying to bring Christianity back to ALL of Britain.One thing that amazes me is how much of actual and real London we see in the series. Threats are to actual known locations in London. I wonder how that feels to a city that has known terrorism for decades. Does it add to the realism or is it giving ideas to the wrong people?The last episode involved environmental terrorists intent on blowing up the Thames barrier if their demands were not met. It's a good bit of high tense drama that made me curious about what the Thames barrier does. What happened with the Thames before there was the barrier. Could terrorists really gain access to the barrier as they do in the series. The cliffhanger is A+++. There was an obvious way to end the season with an obvious cliffhanger with agents in mortal danger yet there is a complete twist in the plot and it is commendable...a brilliant piece of writing and suspense. The twist is seriously unnerving and frightening but totally believable in the context of the story. Now I have to get Season 6.There is constant movement in the cast of MI-5. Only a few remain through the series and there is always some shift. Season 5 introduces us to Ros Meyer played by the remarkable Hermionie Norris. I enjoyed her in WIRE IN THE BLOOD but she left part way through the series so I wonder if it was to move to MI-5. We first meet Ros where she seems to be part of her father's plot to bring down the government. So watch and see how she ends up an MI-5 agent. She's cold, heartless and somewhat ruthless at the beginning--not the most loveable of the team and not one to bring in homemade baked goods to share with coworkers. No problem is an innocent person must be sacrificed to save the masses. That is our Ros.Series 5 delves into the personal life of Adam at the expense of the other agents. I would like to see more of the personal lives of the other agents. How do they lead a duel life with family and friends who think they have normal jobs. Harry and Ruth come close to hooking up and there is a story that I hope will be explored more in the future.I love MI-5 but it is relies heavily on cliches recycled material. As you watch MI-5, you can always be sure at least one cast member will die during the series. Britain, especially London, is always under threat of a major and devastating terrorist attack. There is always a double agent in MI-5 or the British government feeding information to the ""bad guys"". The MI-5 quickly realizes the terrorist have inside information. MI-5 agents always have to make a potentially disastrous decision to override a superior's direct orders or the directives of the British government. The MI-5 agents always know better. Sometimes the threat involves a member of the government and if his role is discovered, ""it will bring down the government."" You'll had that term more than once or twice. Tiny gadgets and cameras can always keep track of an agent's moment in a threatening situation. They can be warned what threat lays around the corner or where the next exit is. The amazing fact is it all reels us in and it is part of the fun. The MI-5 agents always realize what is really happening but arrive seconds too late to save an innocent victim.MI-5 is sheer high tech spy fun. It is silly and hokey at times but it all works and it is totally worth the time to enjoy this fantastic series.",4,STILL GOING STRONG DESPITE SOME FLAWS,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,4236,"['MI-5', 'just', 'grab', 'attention', 'was', 'excited', 'Season', '5', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Adam', 'was', 'hit', 'sniper', 'last', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'Let', 'say', 'cliffhanger', 'resolved', 'seconds', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Quickly', 'MI-5', 'back', 'motion', 'emotionally', 'crippled', 'Adam', 'Adam', 'lingering', 'psychological', 'problems', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'loss', 'beloved', 'wife', 'botched', 'mission', 'last', 'season', 'become', 'ongoing', 'threat', 'efficiency', 'safety', 'MI-5', 'following', 'episodes', 'colleagues', 'begin', 'question', 'judgement.I', 'started', 'feel', 'show', 'was', 'losing', 'bit', 'steam', 'midway', 'season', 'not', 'Islamic', 'terrorist', 'people', 'pretending', 'be', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'various', 'terrorists', 'trying', 'outdo', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'One', 'episode', 'did', 'feature', 'Christian', 'trying', 'bring', 'Christianity', 'back', 'ALL', 'Britain.One', 'thing', 'how', 'much', 'actual', 'real', 'London', 'see', 'series', 'Threats', 'are', 'actual', 'known', 'locations', 'London', 'wonder', 'how', 'city', 'known', 'terrorism', 'decades', 'add', 'realism', 'giving', 'ideas', 'wrong', 'people', 'last', 'episode', 'involved', 'environmental', 'terrorists', 'intent', 'blowing', 'up', 'Thames', 'barrier', 'demands', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'good', 'bit', 'high', 'tense', 'drama', 'made', 'curious', 'what', 'Thames', 'barrier', 'What', 'happened', 'Thames', 'was', 'barrier', 'Could', 'terrorists', 'really', 'gain', 'access', 'barrier', 'do', 'series', 'cliffhanger', 'A+++', 'was', 'obvious', 'way', 'end', 'season', 'obvious', 'cliffhanger', 'agents', 'mortal', 'danger', 'yet', 'complete', 'twist', 'plot', 'commendable', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'writing', 'suspense', 'twist', 'seriously', 'unnerving', 'frightening', 'totally', 'believable', 'context', 'story', 'Now', 'have', 'get', 'Season', '6.There', 'constant', 'movement', 'cast', 'MI-5', 'Only', 'few', 'remain', 'series', 'always', 'shift', 'Season', '5', 'introduces', 'Ros', 'Meyer', 'played', 'remarkable', 'Hermionie', 'Norris', 'enjoyed', 'WIRE', 'IN', 'THE', 'BLOOD', 'left', 'part', 'way', 'series', 'wonder', 'was', 'move', 'MI-5', 'first', 'meet', 'Ros', 'where', 'be', 'part', 'father', 'plot', 'bring', 'down', 'government', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'up', 'MI-5', 'agent', 'cold', 'heartless', 'somewhat', 'ruthless', 'beginning', 'not', 'most', 'loveable', 'team', 'not', 'one', 'bring', 'homemade', 'baked', 'goods', 'share', 'coworkers', 'problem', 'innocent', 'person', 'must', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'save', 'masses', 'Ros.Series', '5', 'delves', 'personal', 'life', 'Adam', 'expense', 'other', 'agents', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'personal', 'lives', 'other', 'agents', 'How', 'do', 'lead', 'duel', 'life', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'normal', 'jobs', 'Harry', 'Ruth', 'come', 'close', 'hooking', 'up', 'story', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'explored', 'more', 'future.I', 'love', 'MI-5', 'relies', 'heavily', 'cliches', 'recycled', 'material', 'watch', 'MI-5', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'sure', 'least', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'will', 'die', 'series', 'Britain', 'especially', 'London', 'always', 'threat', 'major', 'devastating', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'always', 'double', 'agent', 'MI-5', 'British', 'government', 'feeding', 'information', 'bad', 'guys', 'MI-5', 'quickly', 'terrorist', 'have', 'inside', 'information', 'MI-5', 'agents', 'always', 'have', 'make', 'potentially', 'disastrous', 'decision', 'override', 'superior', 'direct', 'orders', 'directives', 'British', 'government', 'MI-5', 'agents', 'always', 'know', 'better', 'Sometimes', 'threat', 'member', 'government', 'role', 'discovered', 'will', 'bring', 'down', 'government', ""'ll"", 'had', 'term', 'more', 'once', 'twice', 'Tiny', 'gadgets', 'cameras', 'can', 'always', 'keep', 'track', 'agent', 'moment', 'threatening', 'situation', 'can', 'be', 'warned', 'what', 'threat', 'corner', 'where', 'next', 'exit', 'amazing', 'fact', 'reels', 'part', 'fun', 'MI-5', 'agents', 'always', 'realize', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'arrive', 'seconds', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'innocent', 'victim.MI-5', 'sheer', 'high', 'tech', 'spy', 'fun', 'silly', 'hokey', 'times', 'works', 'totally', 'worth', 'time', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'series']",MI-5: Vol. 5

I saw that my local library got Volume-5 on their shelves so I grab and watch and love this show. When I was able to purchase for my own collection I notice that in Volume-3 and 5. Because I watch disc season 1 through 6 from the library that in volume-3 that the character Zoe had to go to the Mental institution and was pump with so much drugs that she was never the same nor that character returned. In my personnel collection that same character came back from her nervous condition and started a family and was able to move on from MI-5. I own volume-3,5-10. When I came across Volume-5 I purchase at a local music store a few years back my disc 3 is blank also and that the best episode ever! I was so devastated because I remember that the character call Ruth had to leave or walk away from MI-5.

I tend to agree with the reviewers who felt the series fell flat in series 3 (with the exception of the cliff hanger carried over from series 2). Things start to pick up in series 4 with the series 3 cliff hanger carry over. There is however, one episode where Adam goes under cover as a Syrian (speaking English with an Arab accent) that simply doesn't work.In an earlier review I commented on how characters fell off the series, with a much greater frequency relative to American television. I have changed my stance and have gotten behind this as a useful maneuver to keep the series fresh.In summation:Series 3 = 3*Series 4 (though the final 2 episodes) = 4*-4 1/2*Series 5 (including the final episodes of series 4) = 5* along with my personal statement that this is some of the best TV I have ever seen*****This is the same review that I penned for Amazon UK sans the following advice: Including shipping, Spooks (series 1-6) can be purchased on Amazon UK @ an average cost of $20 US per series (including shipping).

Afterall these are the best of the UK.  Following the BBC series brings the reality home to us. Yes, they all carry guns and are faced with danger every day, but there is a lot of daily 'grunt' work involved.Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth is the Head of the Counter Terrorism Department.  He is the constant in this seriesl. He is one of the few, so far, that has not been killed off. He is the consummate professional that pulls the team back to reality. He is also ready to give up a member of the team if need be. He is the father of the group and each team member is part of his family.Adam Carter, played bt Rupert Penny Jones, is the MI-5 Senior Case Leader. He is a formidable character- ready to lead his team into danger to keep the UK free.  He is suffering from PTSD because of his wife's death. It appears from the signals in the series that we should be prepared for Adam's demise. He has had too many close calla. Rupert is the mainstay of this series and he is a fave.Ros Myers, played by Hermoine Norris is the heroine of the MI-5. Cold, ruthless and beautiful, we know that Ros is lonely and this exterior she portrays has a  great deal of hurt underneath.Malcom Wynn-Jones, played by Hugh Simon plays the technician and data analyst. He is another mainstay of MI-5. He is the one that provides most of the information needed and is the person who is most responsible for keeping the MI-5 team alive.The rest of the team, walk in and out of the series. We just get to know them and they are killed in one manner or another. This series is remarkable in that death of a character is as much a part of reality as introducing someone new.Volume 5 starts with a terrorirst attack on the oil and gas depots. Moves on to the loss of one of the most lovable characters, to an enviornmental group threatening to flood London. Throughout the series, Harry Pearce defends and delivers his MI-5 team to their highest acheievements. This is the series set that deals with terrorism. MI-5 is always current, the events of the world end up in this Spooks series. The United States oftne comes across as devious and deceitful- well, why not, look at our past eight years and our leaders. But the UK takes its own hits and all the thorns seem to come undone.

1140474,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B0013BDQ42,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","Now in its fifth season, MI-5 continues to retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. ""MI-5, a domestic intelligence service composed of a group of British citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the realm,"" is set apart from the external security service, ""MI-6,"" which focus more on international and extra-national concerns that may impact the security of the UK. Under its mandate, MI-5 deals with economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or even any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK. The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally in motion--and shows how the members of ""5"" must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.Season Five maintains, and in some ways, surpasses the drama of the previous seasons by opening up an entirely new line of threat to the country which involves both organizational and personal ""baggage"" from members of both ""5"" and ""6."" As is the case in a number of the later seasons (particularly seasons 5 - 9), the story line weaves an intricate and complex path throughout the episodes, making it requisite that one watch these in order to receive maximum impact and understanding. But I must admit incredulity that the show could surpass the amazing job it has already done in the previous four seasons. I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. Yet the Fifth Season of MI-5 is just like that: there appears to be no limits to the manner in which the show can continue to exceed itself.Again, because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by both season and episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these in order, starting with Season One. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of the first season, and the second set won't arrive at your doorstep quickly enough.The Seasons:MI-5, Volume 1MI-5, Volume 2MI-5, Volume 3MI-5, Volume

1140476,A5LTLD6OQKX4X,B0013BDQ42,Shadowfax,"[1, 1]","MI-5 season 5 definitely demonstrates this series is still the ultimate SPOOK (Spy)show on TV with excitingly intelligent,complicated,innovative stories.  I will admit there is a little more angst in season 5 for the sake of drama, but other than that it's perfect & cleverly entertaining. The episodes kept me riveted at the edge of my seat, especially the second two-part story with an interesting twist.  I especially enjoyed the introduction of Hermoine Norris's character ""Roz"" into this series. She's tough as nails, a risk taker, and stands by her convictions. I was sorry to see what happened to a couple of characters, but that's the hazard these story characters takes in the spook world. The entire cast worked really well together. As for my dvd set, I had no bad disks and were in perfect operating condition.I highly recommend this season/series to those who enjoy a good thriller!",5,"MI-5 Season 5 is on Top of its ""Spy Game""",1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,895,"['MI-5', 'season', '5', 'definitely', 'series', 'still', 'ultimate', 'SPOOK', 'Spy', 'show', 'TV', 'excitingly', 'intelligent', 'complicated', 'innovative', 'stories', 'will', 'admit', 'little', 'more', 'angst', 'season', '5', 'sake', 'drama', 'other', 'perfect', 'cleverly', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'kept', 'riveted', 'edge', 'seat', 'especially', 'second', 'two-part', 'story', 'interesting', 'twist', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'introduction', 'Hermoine', 'Norris', 'character', 'Roz', 'series', 'tough', 'nails', 'risk', 'taker', 'stands', 'convictions', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'couple', 'characters', 'hazard', 'story', 'characters', 'spook', 'world', 'entire', 'cast', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'dvd', 'set', 'had', 'bad', 'disks', 'were', 'perfect', 'operating', 'condition.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season/series', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'thriller']",MI-5: Vol. 5
