The world of Bregna was truly realized in true life.  It's insistance on using natural beauty over industrial was a true genius to the art team.

People who liked the series have probably already seen the movie and been disappointed, but it still has the potential to disappoint a general audience, too.The movie suffers from problems that would doom any movie.  There is a lack of character development, in particular, a lack of explanation for characters' motives.  For example, and trying not to be a spoiler, one character explains that he wants to die simply by saying ""I'm tired.""  Why he's tired, when he hasn't suffered any more than anyone else, really, and less than most, is unclear.  Other characters are killed before we even get to know them, which makes the survivors' over-the-top dedication to them seem a little ridiculous.The second problem are the plot holes.  I know a certain suspension of disbelief is required for this sort of movie.  But, as the many unanswered questions from my date made clear to me, often the characters seem to just be making random choices.  Why blow this or that up?  Why disobey orders NOW?  Why isn't any of the bad guys' technology worth a damn?That brings us to the third problem: it isn't a very interesting vision of the future.  The series had the advantage of actual conflict creating actual drama.  The movie gives Aeon such a massive advantage that you never question the outcome of any particular situation.  She solves all of them in exactly the same way.  even Schwartzenegger flicks have him do something creative once in awhile.  Aeon just shoots or kicks people to death.  Often using the same few moves.  Worse, the bad guys' tech choices are just odd.  Why use razor sharp grass when it is plainly ineffective (there are paths nearby and nobody gets seriously injured even after getting cut)?  Why aren't there any alarms?  Why does the bad guy's stuff just automatically work for Aeon, even when its supposed to be a security device?  When the future's tech is less effective than our own, you know there is a lack of vision somewhere.I grant that the special effects are pretty cool.  They still can't save this movie.  It doesn't even work as a good piece of eye candy because the cool special effects sequences are frequently separated by boring, rather conventional scenes.  I think what happened is the writers grabbed some cool scenes from the series and then just strung them together, using random chunks of story to make them fit together.What you get here is just some Hollywood hacks trying to capitalize on an old series that they didn't really get.  The result for non-fans of the original is just a crummy movie, and for fans, a travesty.  This flick is a straight up rip.

So I was looking forward to Aeon Flux as I still have fond memories of the anarchic blood splattered cartoon series and the cast list boded well. Unfortunately it doesn't really deliver, it's indisputably very stylish with some nice touches, some of the advanced biotech is neat. But it's also extremely clinical with most of the fight scenes being choreographed to death, they're clever, balletic even, but also devoid of any spontaneity and just plain lacking in excitement.It also suffers from a few whacking great big plot holes and as protagonists, despite all their hi tech wizardry, the Monicans must remain some of the dumbest people in creation. There's a coup in progress, the target has been deposed and their top agent has discovered that something weird is going on. Yet they don't have the common sense to pause and reconsider their strategy, they just add their own agent to the hit list, no questions asked.An example of the plot inconsistencies is the death of Una Flux, according to the theory when an adult dies a clone is created, implanted and nine months later born to it's surrogate mother. Yet Aeon was able to hold the new-born version of Una within hours of the adult being exterminated, must be the shortest gestation period in human history.We're also expected to swallow the theory that the dedicated genetic science supremo leader of this utopia is completely oblivious to his idiot younger brother killing off an entire test group. A less observant scientist would be hard to imagine.Overall, it's not a particularly bad movie. It definitely scores on the eye candy front and isn't even particularly dumb.

170372,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,1415720584,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 5]","The cynic in me is beginning to wonder if there is a shortage of filmworthy material out there, as again another borrowed medium makes its transition to the screen. Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very ""special interest"". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation.

My boyfriend fell asleep and my best friend and I loved it.  We wanted to see the animated show afterwards.  My boyfriend still claims its the worst movie he's ever seen ever in a movie theater, while my friend and I are probably going to buy the dvd.The movie boils down to very beautiful love story.  I was familiar with the cartoon from mtv, but i hadn't seen it since it was on the air, like, what was that, ten years ago?  and I was familiar with the love/hate relationship of Aeon and Trevor.  This movie was a tribute to not only the show, but to their unblossomed relationship in the show.  For fans of the cartoon, it was heartwrenching.  They both wanted, practically loved each other, but they couldn't seem to be together.  The way they saw the world was too different.As promised, I bought the cartoon on dvd the second I saw the movie, wanting to freshen up my memory.  To my surprise, I saw many of the scenes and extra characters in the movie were directly from the show, the woman cassandra with the hands for feet, running across the field of automated guns, even scenes and concepts from the mtv liquid shorts that even less people are probably familiar with from before they decided to make it a full  show.The movie takes the relationship between Trevor and Aeon and gives the fans of the show exactly what they wanted to see all along.  The two of them together.  The show was a teasing twisting tale of their jealousy and affections and quiet longings for the other, while the movie goes in depth to create a reason and conclusion for their story.  I can only hope they take all this Aeon Flux's rebirth into making more episodes of the cartoon, which was shockingly short, only ten episodes with an unsatisfying ending.

Now, four hundred years later, all of humanity lives in a walled-in city named Bregna and are led and monitored by a group of scientists. But not all are happy with this arrangement and a rebel group called Monicans have risen to oppose those in charge.And Aeon is one of them.At first glance, the main story of this movie is like many others that have come before: a small band of rebels going up against an oppressive government. But this movie isn't that simple and the aforementioned plot is just what gets us from Point A to B. There are other factors that play into the story, complicated ones, taking what could have just been a B-sci-fi movie all the way to A-level.Charlize Theron stars as Aeon, the Monicans' cold, stick-to-business top assassin. The intensity she brings to the role drags you in and makes you want to discover what makes her tick. Yet she also has a warm side, but one hidden and numbed by years of training and running top secret errands for her team. Theron put on a wonderful show in the lead.The supporting cast, though they all did a good job and their characters were believable, were just that: a supporting cast. No one's performance really stood out except maybe Sophie Okonedo as Sithandra (the girl with the hands for feet). She was just plain cold (in that good way).The special effects are astonishing. There is not a single element in this film that is ""everyday."" Everything was built for it, whether physically or via CGI.

I have to disagree.  This film had an interesting and coherant storyline, mixed with well done action scenes.The special effects were also well done, and several artsy shots from the cartoon also appeared in the movie (such as Aeon catching the fly in her eye lashes).People whom are looking for something which is 100% true to the cartoon may be a bit disapointed.  However I think that most sci-fi fans and fans of the cartoon will enjoy the movie. If you don't fall into either of those categories I can't quite recomend it to you.The relationship between Trevor and Aeon was quite different in the movie than in the cartoon, and the movie as a whole was not highly symbolic as the cartoon was.  While this makes the movie easier to follow, it does lose some of the appeal of the cartoon.The other complaint I heard was that the outfits in the movie were way too ""out there"", and that the movie was almost pornographic. I can honestly not imagine how someone could consider a movie, which is actually rather tame when it comes to sex, to be nearly pornographic (unless you're really really old fasion). In fact the cartoon was quite kinky, and the movie wasn't really, which I admit to wishing it had been. Also the outfits are not as ""out there"" as they were in the cartoon, and if you can appreciate a little bit of weirdness, you will find them well done.edit:For those complaining about her not being emotional enough.  That is exactly how the character Aeon Flux is supposed to be.  Those who have seen the cartoon know that Aeon is as a rule (with very few exceptions, Trevor being the main one, which she deals with an appropriate awkwardness), a tough person whom doesn't get emotional involved with other people.  The movie stayed pretty true to this.While there are a few things in the cartoon that this movie lacked, and I found myself missing them, I do think it is a very well done (though not quite amazing), and interesting adaptation of a cartoon which doesn't easily lend itself to being a live action mostion picture.",4,Much better than expected,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2177,"['reading', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'skeptical', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'ones', 'saw', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'have', 'disagree', 'film', 'had', 'interesting', 'coherant', 'storyline', 'mixed', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'scenes.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'several', 'artsy', 'shots', 'cartoon', 'also', 'appeared', 'movie', 'such', 'Aeon', 'catching', 'fly', 'eye', 'lashes', '.People', 'whom', 'are', 'looking', 'something', '100', '%', 'true', 'cartoon', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disapointed', 'However', 'think', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'fans', 'cartoon', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'categories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'recomend', 'you.The', 'relationship', 'Trevor', 'Aeon', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'cartoon', 'was', 'movie', 'easier', 'follow', 'lose', 'appeal', 'cartoon.The', 'other', 'complaint', 'heard', 'was', 'outfits', 'movie', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'pornographic', 'can', 'honestly', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'consider', 'movie', 'actually', 'rather', 'tame', 'when', 'sex', 'be', 'nearly', 'pornographic', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'old', 'fasion', 'fact', 'cartoon', 'was', 'quite', 'kinky', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'admit', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'Also', 'outfits', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'were', 'cartoon', 'can', 'appreciate', 'little', 'bit', 'weirdness', 'will', 'find', 'well', 'done.edit', 'complaining', 'not', 'being', 'emotional', 'enough', 'exactly', 'how', 'character', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'supposed', 'be', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'know', 'Aeon', 'rule', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Trevor', 'being', 'main', 'one', 'appropriate', 'awkwardness', 'tough', 'person', 'whom', ""n't"", 'get', 'emotional', 'involved', 'other', 'people', 'movie', 'stayed', 'pretty', 'true', 'this.While', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'lacked', 'found', 'missing', 'do', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'quite', 'amazing', 'interesting', 'adaptation', 'cartoon', ""n't"", 'easily', 'lend', 'being', 'live', 'action', 'mostion', 'picture']",N/A

In 2011, life on earth was eradicated by some explosive device and the surviving group formed the perfect society called Bregna, ruled over by the Goodchild regime.  The dessident organization out to defeat this was a group who dressed in funky black clothes and used gymnastics and acrobatics to get around the security systems.Charlize Theron who won an Oscar for playing a real-life 'Monster,' now with a figure like Cyd Charisse, leads the way to the doom of the Goodchilds.  She feels like she is in a gilded cage but has dreams of memories she does not understand.  She said that she had a life once, but now all she has is a mission.  We must show the way.  She agrees to go to the Citadel where they will have their revenge and we will all have victory.  There, in the forum, she confronts Trevor, played by Marton Csokas, and acts like a female John Wilkes Booth until he calls her Catherine which rings a bell.  Nothing is as it seems.Be careful what you wish for!  Trevor showed her what it felt like to be a person instead of an unfeeling thing.  He told her, ""We both are still alive for a reason.  Everything changed when I saw you.""  Both were clones of the originals and the doctor over the lab told her, ""I knew you were important, so I saved your DNA.""  In a war, people on all sides die.  There would have to be consequences to their indiscreet actions.  He is betrayed by his brother, Orrin, who declared that what he did was treason.Suddenly, the situation has changed and has become more complicated.  He'd told her, ""You had your chance, so you know where to find me.""  Clones, they realize, are just like ghosts.  I needed to protect you; you are an idea I kept alive.  She agrees, ""I remembered you.""  After their escape, she patched him together again.  We watch a slaughter down among the cherry blossoms and Orrin is defeated.  It's the end results that count in this case, not how pretty the path is getting there.

170385,A20IIR0422G3A5,1415720584,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 6]","`AeonFlux', directed by Karyn Kusama and produced by James Cameron colleague, Gale Anne Hurd, starring Academy Award (Best Actress, `Monster') winner Charlize Theron is, in spite of all earnest efforts, a mediocre Sci-Fi action flick. That is not to say this DVD is not an interesting purchase, as it is one of the first I have seen where the extras add as much or more value to the purchase as the movie itself.From long years of reading `Heavy Metal' and similar `adult' comic strip fare, I have developed the opinion that both the art and the plots in these works tend to be very derivative of more original works, especially very popular movies. And, since `Aeonflux' is based on an MTV animated feature, I find that it too is very derivative of more original works, in spite of the principle's protestations of originality.I strongly suspect that the primary inspiration for the general situation is the film, `Logan's Run' and the heroine has strong similarities to the video game adventurer, Laura Croft. And, I am sorry to say, that Ms. Theron simply does not carry off the distaff daring do as well as the excellent Angelina Jolie.My primary problems with the movie are that first, it does not fully set the premise up well enough early in the movie, unlike the excellent `Blade Runner' or `Minority Report' for example. Second, I develop no interest whatsoever in the fates of any of the characters. They stay flat against the screen, as do most comic book characters. There is none of the angst we feel for the cinema incarnations of Spiderman or Daredevil or Superman. Third, the world in the background is almost totally sterile. There are none of the rich textures of `Blade Runner' or even `Alien' or `Predator'. The extras do a lot to explain this, but do not relieve the tedium of the movie.I was quite surprised to discover that the movie was shot entirely in Berlin, which turned out to be architecturally even better than their first choice, Brasilia, in spite of the fact that Brasilia is almost identical to the fictional city in the film, as it is set deep in the Amazon jungle. The advantages of Berlin were that there was a thriving movie industry in the city that could supply all sorts of support crew, not to mention a wealth of great costumers and set decorators. And, the scenes were not all-modern post-World War II concrete. Some scenes were done in the gardens of Frederick the Great's summer palace and some other scenes were done in a pre-World War II build aircraft testing tunnel.I was also delighted to see that many of the costumes were inspired by the 1970's Bernardo Bertolluci film, `The Conformist', which I was also pleased to see was to be released on DVD soon, as it has always been one of my favorite Italian films. There were several video documentaries on the sets, costumes, special effects, and stunts, plus my favorite extra, two voice-overs, one by the star and lead producer and one by the screenwriters.One of my least favorite aspects of the movie is the fact that the great Frances McDormand appears in a role that totally wastes her talent. That comes on top of the fact that the rationale for the role is totally inexplicable, and connected to virtually nothing else in the film.Like so many comic book movies, including the Lara Croft epics, poor plot and characterization may be forgiven if the visceral impact is good. I found nothing here that got me the least excited about what was happening on the screen. All I could think about were the errors in science where, for example, they give the impression that characters somehow become immortal because they are cloned from one generation to the next. I'm afraid it simply doesn't work that way. A clone shares no more in the personality, memories, or `spirit' of the original than a naturally born baby shares any intellectual material from natural parents.In the end, this DVD is literally more valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience.",4,Weak action and plot.

170386,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,1415720584,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[30, 35]","Once again I find myself in the minority. The Tomatometer's gauge at rottentomatoes.com levels off at an extremely cool 10% approval rating; meaning 90% of the critics DIDN'T like it.Most of the bashing comes via comparisons to CATWOMAN (another bomb) or the fact that the original Aeon Flux was an animated feature on MTV and the translation to live-action cinema didn't work. Not having seen these animated versions - or CATWOMAN for that matter - I can't make any comparisons. But what I can do is tell you how the movie flowed, how well it was acted, and its entertainment value.Charlize Theron (NORTH COUNTRY) stars as Aeon Flux, a rebel in the 25th century. A terrible disease has decimated humanity and its surviving members hide behind an enclosure, cut-off from the possible devastating effects of what lay beyond (think LOGAN'S RUN and you'll be close). Within the confines of their home live the remaining five million members of society thanks to the medical efforts of the Goodchild Regime, named after Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas). Aeon Flux belongs to an elite group of resistance fighters known as the Monicans who's goal is to topple the Goodchild Regime. People have been vanishing. Police actions are resulting in deaths. And Aeon Flux is going to find out why.As we move through the stronghold of humanity (the city is known as Bregna), we learn and see much about this futuristic yet completely alien-like society. Pills can heighten awareness and even send coded messages to ones brain. Computers look like musical instruments or a type of String Theory. Everyone feels that something is wrong with their world ...and there is. Cloning and its effects on the power-base of the Goodchild Regime are holding humanity back at a terrible price.CATWOMAN comparisons aside (yes, Charlize looks fantastic in her skin-tight leather outfit), this is a thinking person's film. There are lots of little tidbits thrown into the film that give it a futuristic look without trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).The pacing of the film was excellent. Never once did it get bogged down in the minutia of the times or the science. If you can't keep up, oh well. Leaping from action sequence to fight scene to action sequence made the 93 minutes fly by. The acting was okay. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. Charlize was the shining star, of course, and gave a relatively fine performance.For my time, this was extremely entertaining and sexy, and full of great sci-fi scenery.Only one question remains: What's up with the critics?!",4,"Sexy, Sleek, Sci-Fi Spectacle",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2655,"['Once', 'again', 'find', 'minority', 'Tomatometer', 'gauge', 'rottentomatoes.com', 'levels', 'off', 'extremely', 'cool', '10', '%', 'approval', 'rating', 'meaning', '90', '%', 'critics', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'like', 'it.Most', 'bashing', 'comparisons', 'CATWOMAN', 'bomb', 'fact', 'original', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'was', 'animated', 'feature', 'MTV', 'translation', 'live-action', 'cinema', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'animated', 'versions', 'CATWOMAN', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'comparisons', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'tell', 'how', 'movie', 'flowed', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'acted', 'entertainment', 'value.Charlize', 'Theron', 'NORTH', 'COUNTRY', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'rebel', '25th', 'century', 'terrible', 'disease', 'decimated', 'humanity', 'surviving', 'members', 'hide', 'enclosure', 'cut-off', 'possible', 'devastating', 'effects', 'what', 'lay', 'think', 'LOGAN', 'RUN', ""'ll"", 'be', 'close', 'confines', 'home', 'live', 'remaining', 'five', 'million', 'members', 'society', 'thanks', 'medical', 'efforts', 'Goodchild', 'Regime', 'named', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'Martin', 'Csokas', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'elite', 'group', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'known', 'Monicans', 'who', 'goal', 'topple', 'Goodchild', 'Regime', 'People', 'have', 'been', 'vanishing', 'Police', 'actions', 'are', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'why.As', 'move', 'stronghold', 'humanity', 'city', 'known', 'Bregna', 'learn', 'see', 'much', 'futuristic', 'yet', 'completely', 'alien-like', 'society', 'Pills', 'can', 'heighten', 'awareness', 'even', 'send', 'coded', 'messages', 'ones', 'brain', 'Computers', 'look', 'musical', 'instruments', 'type', 'String', 'Theory', 'Everyone', 'feels', 'something', 'wrong', 'world', 'Cloning', 'effects', 'power-base', 'Goodchild', 'Regime', 'are', 'holding', 'humanity', 'back', 'terrible', 'price.CATWOMAN', 'comparisons', 'aside', 'yes', 'Charlize', 'fantastic', 'skin-tight', 'leather', 'outfit', 'thinking', 'person', 'film', 'are', 'lots', 'little', 'tidbits', 'thrown', 'film', 'give', 'futuristic', 'look', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'computers', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'were', 'filming', 'many', 'external', 'shots', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'where', 'new', 'construction', 'rage', 'pacing', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'Never', 'once', 'did', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'minutia', 'times', 'science', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'oh', 'well', 'Leaping', 'action', 'sequence', 'fight', 'scene', 'action', 'sequence', 'made', '93', 'minutes', 'fly', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'Nothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'either', 'Charlize', 'was', 'shining', 'star', 'course', 'gave', 'relatively', 'fine', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'sexy', 'full', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'scenery.Only', 'one', 'question', 'What', 'up', 'critics']",N/A

Unhappy with the government, a radical group called the Monicans revolts by sly and secretive means.  An assassin for the Monicans, Aeon Flux is given an all-important mission that could deliver to her the vengeance she has yearned for over so many years.This movie presents an interesting concept and might even have been watchable, had acting glitches and predictable outcomes not littered the film.My first complaint: the plot.  The idea of a futuristic and perfect civilization catches attention, but the story that is placed against this backdrop is positively sickening.  The twists, turns, and realizations (I can't go into them without ruining the movie for anyone that doesn't heed my warning) are so predictable as to become painfully corny.  In addition, the revelations that are supposed to make the audience root for the revolutionaries and hate the government aren't very convincing.  You find yourself wondering what was so bad with the civilization in the first place.Complaint Number Two: the pacing.  All the ""important"" and plot-making dialogues are crammed in between random fight scenes and long shots of Charlize Theron in skimpy outfits.  It's as though the director was trying to attract viewers not with the plot or movie itself, but with the lure of Charlize Theron in some beaded and very revealing concoction.Complaint Three: acting and casting.

With that said and done, I must say Aeon Flux falls flat on its hopeful face.  The special effects are awesome, Charlize Theron is brilliant as Aeon Flux (although I hated her shoes) and Marton Csokas is the perfect Trevor Goodchild (although his appearance would have benefited greatly if he had bleached his hair blonde like the animated Trevor). Also Frances McDormand is good for a chuckle as the leader of the Monicans.However, the problem with this big screen version of Aeon Flux is there's too much focus on plot.  Part of the charm of the animated version is the ambiguity of the storyline, being thrust into the middle of the action not quite knowing the whats or the whys of what is happening. Aeon wasn't exactly a likeable, moral or ""good guy"" character and all of the blatant sexuality and sado-masochistic undertones found in the animated series are completely stripped away leaving behind a very homogenous film trying very hard to create a cohesive storyline out of a very incohesive and abstract half hour show.

Nothing worse than people that want you to see their bold reviewing vision and then they slap someone in the face with a sexist/elderly discremination remark. Gee, like only the MTV generation understands Science Fiction and this movie. Funny but last time I checked Sci Fi was around and being read long before even I was born let alone someone such as yourself. I was probably reading Isaac Asimov before you were born, so what does that prove? One thing, I have learned age and sex have nothing to do with how people interpret SciFi. Now that we got that out of the way, this is a good movie. Some are being overly critical because of the predictable invulnerability of Aeon and how it is overly easy for her to take out everyone else. I too must admit it was a touch heavy handed, but then so was ""The Matrix"". The faults are minor when you consider the quality of the story, action, and the effects. Take time to watch it a second time and reflect on it before being so harsh.This movie may seem simple to some, but it has a good deal under the surface. One critical viewer went on about the blimp used to hide the DNA instead of a vault being stupid. I say, not at all. Hiding in plain sight is often quite smart. No one would expect something of great value in a blimp that could be easily shot down or boarded, and the keeper was there to make it seem like something ordinary. Another indicated this was new for a woman to strike out for her believes. Nothing new about a young woman striking out for her believes. Most recently I recall ""Underworld"" using that plotline, and then there was ""Final Fantasy"", et cetera, but I digress. The story is different in the respect of a different look at a future society. As mentioned previously by a couple truly open minded reviews, that is a tough nut to crack. ""Logan's Run"" 30 years later still looks okay even if the effects seem a bit hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme. SciFi fans will probably like it best, but anyone with an open mind may find it entertaining. I suggest renting before buying. Personally I liked the acting and story so much I am buying it. The trailers did not do this movie justice. They make it look like a mindless action movie.

170400,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,1415720584,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 8]","I have vague recollections about back in the day (the early to mid 1990s I believe) when Aeon Flux, created by Peter Chung, appeared on MTV as a segment within the series `Liquid Television'...while my memory's a bit fuzzy, two aspects about the Aeon Flux segments have stayed with me over the years, the first being how stylish they appeared and the second being how confusing they seemed...(perhaps had I seen all the episodes in their respective order it'd be different).  Fast forward some ten odd years later to the 2005 release of a live action adaptation written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, both of whom worked on The Tuxedo (2002), directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), and starring Academy Award winner Charlize Theron (The Astronaut's Wife, Reindeer Games, Monster).  Also appearing is Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, xXx), Jonny Lee Miller (Mindhunters), Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), and Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (Darkman, Fargo)...I'm curious how much MTV, who produced the film, had to shell out for two Academy Award winning actresses to appear in this feature...As the film, set sometime in the 25th century, begins, we learn how a virus wiped out most of the world's population some four hundred years earlier before a scientist named Goodchild finally found a cure.  Now it seems the descendants of those who survived live in a walled city under the thumb of the Goodchild Dynasty, which has ruled since the catastrophic event.  As with any society there is a group of malcontents, known here as the Monicans, whose main goal appears to be in toppling the Goodchild regime...why?  As near as I can figure they're upset with the fact that it's not unusual for people to just up and disappear, never to be heard from again, something the Monicans think the gooberment is directly responsible for (and they'd be right)...anyway, in furthering their cause, the Monicans utilize secretive, highly deadly operatives, the most skilled being Aeon Flux (Theron).  After successfully completing her current assignment, she's given the one she's been waiting been waiting for, the elimination of Trevor Goodchild (Csokas), the current leader of the Goodchild regime.  While infiltrating the gooberment facility where Goodchild resides, things turn sour and Aeon begins to question those things she originally believed, which ends up leading to an unlikely alliance.  Turns out there is something seriously wrong with the population, the answers lying within a funky zeppelin known as the Relical, which continually circles above the city.  As a power struggle within the gooberment ensues, Aeon finds herself stuck in the middle as both the Establishment, who see her as a threat, and the Monicans, who see her as a traitor, want her dead, resulting in a struggle for survival that may ultimately decide the fate of mankind...Overall I thought this film entertaining, but it does have some flaws.  I thought the production values excellent especially in terms of the futuristic settings and such (the `stylish' element I spoke of earlier in terms of the original series seems to have made it into the film).  I also really liked all the nifty little high tech gadgets and implants utilized mainly by Theron's character, although I thought it interesting how, by the end, everyone fell back to using what appeared to be fairly standard projectile based weaponry (I guess some things never change).  As far as Theron herself, she displayed quite a bit of athleticism, some of which I'm sure was probably helped along by the special effects department, while looking fairly sweet in her numerous, skintight outfits (actually, with her Der Fuhrer-esque hairstyle and black clothing, she sort of came off as the ultimate Emo chick, but whatever).  I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the performances seemed somewhat flat, but I'm unsure if it was a result of the actors, the director, or the material (some of the cast is just plain wasted, like Frances McDormand...what was the deal with her character and that ridiculous red hair?).  Also, Theron didn't really come off as the ultimate assassin, at least when comparing her to the character presented in the original animated series, despite a good effort.  I learned quite a few things from this film including the following...1. Charlize Theron can catch flies with her eyelashes, which is kinda cool but also kinda gross.2. In the future the predominant hairstyle for men is the greasy bed head look.3. In the future secret messages are passed amongst people by French kissing.4. Charlize Theron can kill with her thighs (which wouldn't be too bad of a way to go, if you ask me).5. People in the future are stuck with really weird names like Oren, Una, Sithandra, and Aeon.6. In the future you can actually get your feet replaced with hands, which looks as creepy as it sounds.7. The Future is so Goth.8. In the future authorities are armed with highly advanced weaponry and have no problems using said weaponry to mow down innocent bystanders to get to two criminals.9. In the future when you get a phone call, your ears flash (no foolin').10. In the future when they say `keep off the grass' they ain't kidding.11. Despite a dumb hairdo Charlize Theron can still look hot, which isn't so much the case with Frances McDormand.12. Fluidic ball bearings can not only be trained to come on command but also to assemble in patterns and explode.13. Recycling is taken to a whole new level in the 25th century.14. Politicians in the future are just as skeevy and conniving as they are now.One aspect of the story that kind of bothered me was how the Monicans seemed to have a technological edge over the established gooberment.  They were able to infiltrate various facilities with relative ease (razor grass sounds like an effective security measure, that is until you get someone who comes along with platform shoes), keep things hidden on their person while in custody, and just generally outfox the authorities at nearly every turn.  The film does have lots of action, slick production values, a decent catfight, and I had little difficulty in following the story (what of it there was), but I couldn't say how closely this finished product resembled the original material.The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks very sharp and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and Dolby Surround 2.0 comes across well.  Extras include two feature length commentary tracks, one with star Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the second with co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, five featurettes involving production of the movie, a theatrical trailer, a couple of previews, and English and Spanish subtitles.Cookieman108By the way, it appears the animated series is available on DVD, so if you're interested in seeing from where the film originated, you might want to check it out.",3,"""I had a family once, I had a life.

Sure Charlize Theron is always nice to look at on the screen, but I think it would be better to just watch her walk around talking with her real life friends than have to put up with such a silly addlebrained plot.  The science it espouses makes no sense, the fighting makes no sense (why wear bright white clothes to an attack at night?), the love relationship makes little sense, and the destruction of the technology that Aeon alone has decided must end is stupid beyond belief.And, by the way, a world of only five million people could not live in the luxury and with the technology this city-state (I guess a kind of advanced Singapore) generates.  Frankly, they would be scrabbling about for food and such.  Where are the food producers?  Where are the carpenters, plumbers, programmers, die makers, assemblers, cooks, gardeners, and so forth?  Calling this a parable doesn't get stupidity off the hook.Can we also stop, puh-leeze, with the hundred and ten pound skinny women beating up entire armies of two hundred pound males?  And why is it that the hero can spray machine gun fire into the air and each bullet takes down a bad guy, but trained and armored soldiers who happen to be bad guys can lay down focused and directed fire and produce only survivable wounds in the heroes?

170404,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,1415720584,Cubist,"[3, 4]","Aeon Flux is a live-action adaptation of the critically-lauded animated T.V. show by Peter Chung. This movie was something of a gamble as the show only managed to spawn a small, but dedicated cult following. Now, comes along a big budget movie starring Charlize Theron as the eponoymous protagonist. Unfortunately, the show's creator had no input into the movie which only further alienates it from the fan base. However, I think fans will be pleasantly surprised at just how faithful the movie is to the show.Charlize Theron certainly has Aeon's emotionless attitude down cold and is more than up for her character's athleticism. It is an extremely physically demanding role that she is more than capable of, showing an impressive prowess. However, Marton Csokas is miscast as Trevor. He doesn't look like his animated counterpart nor does he act like him - a lecherous powermonger. Csokas goes in the opposite direction as a quietly confident leader.This film has top notch production design and special effects with well-choreographed action sequences often accompanied by the requisite techno music. The sterile, futuristic look, flashy martial arts and Orwellian society is reminiscent of Equilibrium, although its action sequences were much better as was its kinetic editing - something that this movie could have used more of. In an interesting twist, all of this society's top assassins are women and, like in the Kill Bill movies, there are ferocious fight scenes between highly trained and very dangerous women, each with their own unique skills.The animated series was a fantastic example of abstract sci-fi surrealism and to capture that in a live-action movie is a difficult task to say the least. The film tries to have it both ways. It's not quite abstract as it should be and is not as pedestrian as it could have been. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why it failed to capture a mainstream audience. It's too abstract for most and not abstract enough for the show's fans, leaving it in an odd state of limbo.There is an audio commentary by Charlize Theron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd. Theron talks about the challenges of the intense, physical training she underwent for this role and then Hurd, in turn, praises her physical prowess. This is fairly decent track and both commentators are engaging.Also included is a commentary by the film's screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. They point out connections between the film and the animated series. They also talk about how much exposition was needed to set up this world and how the challenge is to tell enough but not to overwhelm or bore the audience.""Creating a World: Aeon Flux"" examines the challenge of adapting an experimental, non-narrative cartoon into a Hollywood movie. We see Peter Chung visiting the set and marveling at his drawings being brought to life.""The Locations of Aeon Flux."" Kusama originally wanted to shoot in Brasilia because it had an ideal, futuristic look that was surrounded by jungle. It wasn't practical for them to shoot there so Berlin was their next choice because it also had futuristic looking architecture.""The Stunts of Aeon Flux."" Charlize Theron trained hard for this role. She came from a dancing background so she was very flexible - an ideal attribute for her character.

170408,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1415720584,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 4]","With special effects and action superseding characterization, Aeon Flux makes for a fast-paced futuristic trip to the 25th century.  There's a definite ""cool"" factor to the whole thing, what with all sorts of ingenious futuristic gizmos and Charlize Theron's nifty little outfit, and the story, which is not exactly straightforward, does tie everything together in the end, but this just didn't feel like a complete movie experience to me.  This comes partly from the fact that the movie basically drops you into the middle of an unusual story without really providing you with a guide map at the start, but it has even more to do with the fact that the characters in this film are rather robotic.  The main character, Aeon Flux (Theron), is basically a terrorist, so it's a little hard to sympathize with her early on - especially since you have no way of judging the government or its leader, Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas).  When personal feelings do finally work their way into the story, they really aren't that dramatic at all.  Rather than explore anyone to any great depth, the director just keeps diverting our attention with special effects.Here's the backdrop for this story: in 2011, some disease wiped out 99% of the human population before a scientist was able to find a cure for it.  This scientist basically built a large walled city to house all of those he was able to save - and no one has been outside the walls in the last four centuries.  The Monicans, an underground group of terrorists and assassins, want their true freedom (and seem to be the only folks concerned by the fact that random people just keep disappearing out of the blue) and have decided that the Goodchild regime has to go.  Since Aeon Flux is their top assassin, she is given the task of assassinating Trevor Goodchild.  If you're thinking that 25th century security must surely be better than its modern-day equivalent, think again - Aeon basically just has to avoid some spiky grass and dart-shooting coconuts (and, if you're wondering, the ""bad guys"" of the future still can't hit the broad side of a barn).  Once Aeon comes face to face with Goodchild, everything changes for reasons she herself really doesn't understand.  As if things weren't complicated enough already, you also have a coup d'etat thrown in the mix.It takes a while for the viewer to find out what is really going on here, as the film is more concerned with showing off fancy special effects and superhuman abilities than it is in giving us a tightly-wound plot.  I for one would have liked to get at least a cursory look at this futuristic society and better insight into the main characters.

Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional. I'll trade a low budget, low eye-candy film with a good story over this tedious trash, any day!Do us all a big favor! Don't encourage Hollywood to continuely make nonsense like Aeon Flux! Instead of trudging off to your local theater, treat yourself to a great film like the Matrix, or discover an old gem, like Zardoz!

170416,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,1415720584,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 7]","...and I'm saying that as a positive thing, not a literal meaning to the term.- REVIEWHey, you!  Yea, you!  Are you one of those people that seen the previews of ""Aeon Flux"" and thinking, ""Woah!  This movie's so gonna suck; I mean, ""Catwoman"" suck""?  Well, my unseen random consumer...I cannot blame you: the concept looks awkward, the stunts are glorified, and Theron's costume screams out ""blech!"".  My thoughts haven't changed, but within 700 words, my thoughts will render how this 1-star predicted disaster convert into a shocking 3-star entertaining romp.With 1-star on my mind, I have to grasp into the story, which is about as comprehensible as Dubya Bush making his speech.  In about 7 years from now, 99% of the Earth's pop is dead from a virus...possibly from the avian flu.  Those that survived are on scientific notice, and one Trevor Goodchild conducted a cure that will purity the remains...sort of.  All I know is that 400 years into the future, one 'psychedechnical' (Psychedelic meets Technical) city holds the survivors under control of the Goodchild regime, runned by the same guy who cured them 400 years ago (???).  But the rebels against the regime's reign continues to weaking his power, though the territorial rebels are destroying for the good, as the regime are really hostile that often kills certain civilians that might corrupt the nation's premise.  In other words: Government = bad; ""bad guys"" = good.  Only one Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), a high-ranked fighter of the rebels, has the strength to take down something as confusing as the regime.So, Ms. Theron here fights the government wearing clothes that ranges from ""Awful"" to ""Not awful like the last one"", although I doubt Theron would degrade herself to wear the old revealing get-up the original femme fatale wore on the animated show.Anyway, the ""future"" remains uncertain, and by uncertain, I mean I have no idea how anything I see in this film work.  How did Aeon's weapons work, how do the futuristic security system function, how is swallowing some pill got Aeon get in touch with the leader of the rebels from her mind, and what are the foods these people are eating?  It seems as though the movie just goes into the future setting without any hint of social explanation.  At least the producers kept the atmosphere in spirit of the original series, along with its intended characters and premise.  And as long as you can tolerate some of the actors goofy one-liners, the characters act well, and Theron is a good Aeon, which is why the star went up a pound.Another pick-er-upper is the fact that the movie has layers, albeit layers done very sloppy.  As Aeon confrots Trevor to assassinate in a vengeful manner, as she should, a revelation occurs when love and secluded past memories affected her way of thinking.  Neither had killed each other, which resulted in a backlash between the regime and rebels.  That's when the good part sets in, as many mysteries of the film (but not all) have been revealved that deals with the past, the search for a cure, and cloning.  Now, she and Trevor alone are on their own mission to find a solution to the nation's problem, while getting away from the regime who not only considered them as fugitives, but so has the rebels who now wants to kill Aeon.""Aeon Flux"" is not so bad, I was really surprised.  The abrupt and incohesive premise should've been dealt with more ""flux""-iblilty, but the fact remains: it's not boring, it had some cool action scenes, and it had a solid story as it progresses.  As long as you don't think of this as Theron's big hit like ""Monster"" or ""North Country"", this film will give you a decent time.This is Del Keyes, saying ""At least it's better than that Tomb Raider film.""",3,"Suprisingly, it's not as ""fluxxed"" as I though it'd be...",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,3740,"[""'m"", 'saying', 'positive', 'thing', 'not', 'literal', 'meaning', 'term.-', 'REVIEWHey', 'Yea', 'Are', 'one', 'people', 'seen', 'previews', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'thinking', 'Woah', 'movie', 'so', 'gon', 'suck', 'mean', 'Catwoman', 'suck', 'Well', 'unseen', 'random', 'consumer', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'concept', 'awkward', 'stunts', 'are', 'glorified', 'Theron', 'costume', 'out', 'blech', 'thoughts', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', '700', 'words', 'thoughts', 'will', 'render', 'how', '1-star', 'predicted', 'disaster', 'convert', 'shocking', '3-star', 'entertaining', 'romp.With', '1-star', 'mind', 'have', 'grasp', 'story', 'as', 'comprehensible', 'Dubya', 'Bush', 'making', 'speech', '7', 'years', 'now', '99', '%', 'Earth', 'pop', 'dead', 'virus', 'possibly', 'avian', 'flu', 'survived', 'are', 'scientific', 'notice', 'one', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'conducted', 'cure', 'will', 'purity', 'remains', 'sort', 'know', '400', 'years', 'future', 'one', ""'psychedechnical"", 'Psychedelic', 'Technical', 'city', 'survivors', 'control', 'Goodchild', 'regime', 'runned', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'cured', '400', 'years', 'ago', 'rebels', 'regime', 'reign', 'weaking', 'power', 'territorial', 'rebels', 'are', 'destroying', 'good', 'regime', 'are', 'really', 'hostile', 'often', 'certain', 'civilians', 'might', 'corrupt', 'nation', 'premise', 'other', 'words', 'Government', '=', 'bad', 'bad', 'guys', '=', 'good', 'Only', 'one', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'high-ranked', 'fighter', 'rebels', 'strength', 'take', 'down', 'something', 'as', 'confusing', 'regime.So', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'here', 'government', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'Awful', 'Not', 'awful', 'last', 'one', 'doubt', 'Theron', 'would', 'degrade', 'wear', 'old', 'revealing', 'get-up', 'original', 'femme', 'fatale', 'wore', 'animated', 'show.Anyway', 'future', 'uncertain', 'uncertain', 'mean', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'anything', 'see', 'film', 'work', 'How', 'did', 'Aeon', 'weapons', 'work', 'how', 'do', 'futuristic', 'security', 'system', 'function', 'how', 'swallowing', 'pill', 'got', 'Aeon', 'get', 'touch', 'leader', 'rebels', 'mind', 'are', 'foods', 'people', 'are', 'eating', 'movie', 'just', 'future', 'setting', 'hint', 'social', 'explanation', 'least', 'producers', 'kept', 'atmosphere', 'spirit', 'original', 'series', 'intended', 'characters', 'premise', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'tolerate', 'actors', 'goofy', 'one-liners', 'characters', 'act', 'well', 'Theron', 'good', 'Aeon', 'why', 'star', 'went', 'up', 'pound.Another', 'pick-er-upper', 'fact', 'movie', 'layers', 'layers', 'done', 'very', 'sloppy', 'Aeon', 'confrots', 'Trevor', 'assassinate', 'vengeful', 'manner', 'should', 'revelation', 'when', 'love', 'secluded', 'past', 'memories', 'affected', 'way', 'thinking', 'had', 'killed', 'other', 'resulted', 'backlash', 'regime', 'rebels', 'when', 'good', 'part', 'sets', 'many', 'mysteries', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'revealved', 'deals', 'past', 'search', 'cure', 'cloning', 'Now', 'Trevor', 'alone', 'are', 'own', 'mission', 'find', 'solution', 'nation', 'problem', 'getting', 'away', 'regime', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'considered', 'fugitives', 'so', 'rebels', 'who', 'now', 'kill', 'Aeon', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'abrupt', 'incohesive', 'premise', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'more', 'flux', '-iblilty', 'fact', 'not', 'boring', 'had', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'had', 'solid', 'story', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Theron', 'big', 'hit', 'Monster', 'North', 'Country', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'decent', 'time.This', 'Del', 'Keyes', 'saying', 'least', 'better', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'film']",N/A

In addition, the action was paced rather well. And, yes, I recommend watching... as a rental.My reservations stem from the insult to my intelligence delivered by a ludicrous plot. The writer lacked imagination to sew his plot together, and therefore relied on the most outrageous twists and turns that can only strike the audience as false. I am not even going to begin exploring all the inconsistencies, logical fallacies, and outright irrational behavior of characters in the film. It's a film made of swiss cheese, rife with holes, and you just have to put your thinking mind on a shelf, and regress to childhood and ENJOY.

170421,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,1415720584,"D Strick ""Entertainment D""","[3, 7]","Let's get it out of the way.  Did Aeon Flux the movie live up to the legacy of its animated version.  Of course not.  It tried though.Over 400 years in the future the remnants of mankind live in one city lorded over by Trevor Goodchild who may or may not be working to save humanity.  Aeon is a rebel assigned to kill him but can't due to strange memories and feelings.  The plot revloves around her getting the answers as to why this is.We'll hit the positives first.  Charlize Theron looks good jumping around in skin tight outfits.  Her hair, while not Aeon's signature (ram's horns?) hairdo, was a decent compromise and actually looked pretty sexy.  Set design and locations were top notch and the special effects were hip.  All the action was pretty action packed and only got completely unbelievable in a couple of spots.  As a sci-fi popcorn muncher, not to shabby.  But...The not so positive aspects may bring you down if you're looking for more.The plot, while passable, would really have been OK as a 30 minute cartoon, but stretched to 90 minutes became monotonous.  Aeon's wardrobe, while skin tight, was nowhere near as racy as cartoon Aeon's.  Its sad that the cartoon could be so much sexier than a live action movie.  What was up with the PG-13 rating anyway.  One of the hallmarks of the animated show was its more adult themes and highly intelligent (and sometimes impossible) plots.  Oh, well.  If you happen to be a fan of animated Aeon then you probabaly love animated Trevor Goodchild as well.  This version is a wishy washy substitute compared to cool animated Trevor.

Last summer, big-budget schlockmeister Michael Bay went for the eternal youth angle in his bombastic though periodically thoughtful morass, ""The Island"", and now indie filmmaker Karyn Kusama makes cloning the lifeblood of Bregna, a cloistered city ruled by the dictatorial Goodchild family. Based on an MTV animated series from a decade ago, this 2005 film set in 2415 has the sheen of a stylish cartoon but the mindset of a confused pair of screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, working off cartoonist Peter Chung's convoluted concepts about the self-destruction of mankind.Sporting an unfortunate Alan Cumming haircut, Charlize Theron plays the title role by showing off impressive athletic prowess and looking svelte in her black cat suit, but she is bereft of personality, at least one that would draw interest to her character's fate. Consequently, she speaks in a blank-faced monotone that seems to drain more energy than the Matrix-like kicks she uses to pummel her adversaries. As a Monican, an underground resistance movement out to eliminate the ruling Goodchilds, Aeon is instructed by the Handler to assassinate the leader, Trevor Goodchild. Yet, in the moment of key confrontation, she cannot do it for reasons that unfold in clunky plot turns that seem to weigh down an already clunky set-up. Any sensibility the story has - which is minimal anyway - is put completely on hold until the revelations come about later.Why actresses of the caliber of Theron, Frances McDormand (no more than a talking head as the Handler) and Sophie Okonedo (so impressive in ""Hotel Rwanda"" but simply posturing here as Aeon's colleague Sithandra) are involved in this debacle is the bigger mystery that should be solved. The men fare no better with Marton Csokas saddled with the film's most laborious lines as Trevor and Johnny Lee Miller who seems to be making a career of playing thoroughly obnoxious characters as his power-hungry younger brother Oren. The action set pieces should have saved this movie, but for the most part, they are quite dull and ridiculous and what's worse, edited badly, in particular, the first acrobatic display of Aeon and Sithandra as they attempt to gain entry into the Goodchild enclave.As the mind-numbing jumble of a story unwraps the mysteries behind the relationship between Aeon and Trevor, it doesn't provide enlightenment as much as it softens an already weak storyline with a romance novel angle. I think the filmmakers had good intentions in showing another variation of a post-apocalyptic world, but even with the slight twist toward the end and Aeon's consequent humanization, there isn't an element in the film that feels fresh.

It would be better to describe it as 'inspired by' rather than use the same title.  You can see gimmicks and vignettes from the animation series,  but it is not the same plot or story line, and it is not a continuation of the cartoons.Taken as a discrete cinema production, it is a pretty darn good action/sci-fi flick!  What the story couldn't carry,  the action did, and when the action faltered, the story got engaging.  Trevor Goodchild is considerably toned down from the cartoon, and much more human.  He leads a government that is more concerned with its own continuation than the good of its members, and is trying to resolve issues from his personal life in the process.Charlize Theron as Aeon...  She is a remarkably pretty woman, and has the grace and the moves for the role, but is model/Hollywood skinny :(If she'd put on 20-30 lb of muscle and go up to about 15% body fat she'd have been perfect, much more plausible for the role.Aside from this bit of personal bias, she carried off the intensity of a fanatic remarkably well.Over all: One very good movie!

170425,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,1415720584,Enjolras,"[2, 2]","The concept behind Aeon Flux is intriguing. It's a dystopian vision of the future in which all but a handful of people died out from a disease. The survivors are left in an Orwellian community that claims to be the last refuge against a disease. But a handful of rebels has risen up against the leaders. There's potential for a fascinating sci-fi plot. Unfortunately, the movie generally descends into a flashy Hollywood action flick after that. The movie does resolve the plot with an interesting twist, but doesn't really explore the moral or philosophical implications. I guess if anything it's a more thoughtful and interesting action movie, but could have been more.I do appreciate the cinematography for the film. There are some visually interesting scenes. Much of the movie is done in an almost abstract style. It relies heavily on visual imagery and relatively less on dialogue to tell the story. Generally, this worked well. The futuristic world was mysterious but not too unrealistic. Lovely use of water for various scenes.As for acting, let's just say Charlize Theron can pull off an action hero.Overall, Aeon Flux is worth checking out for fans of sci-fi action movies.

170426,A146D2LYLICNLS,1415720584,eric_f,"[4, 6]","First off, I have only seen segments of the Liquid Television ""Aeon Flux"" animated episodes back in the 90's, so I'm not qualified to give an in-depth comparison to this movie. And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else.That out of the way, I found ""Aeon Flux"" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral.Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.All in all, I recommend ""Aeon Flux,"" but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie).

If you have never seen the animated series on MTV, then it may be a bit confusing at first, but like all good twist-ended movies, it all comes together.My number one reason I loved it so much is that it is technically classifed as Sci-Fi, but yet, it isn't your typical floating cars, all metal, everything electronic future. It's very ethereal and visually beautiful.The plotline itself could have used a bit more work to explain a few small things here and there, but if you have a brain in your head you can for the most part pick up on everything that is going on. A lot of people are bashing this movie because they say it drags on and is confusing. THAT IS THE POINT!!!!!!! They want you to be cloaked in mystery up until the very end.....it makes your brain think about all the possibilities........ I personally liked the overall plot. It was very enticing, and perhaps left it open for a very different sequel.The animated series was very weird for most, Aeon died at the end every episode, which obviously worked for the tv series since DNA is recycled and a tv series has to go on........so some that have seen the tv series are dissappointed because of that, and for the fact that it was very sexually oriented and strange. They toned it down for the movie so that it would be suitable for all audiences. They even say in the costume design part of the special feautres that they toned down Aeons costumes because she is doing crazy stunts and they didnt want her flying out of her costume. I mean, things can't be absolutely copied and perfect for numerous reasons........have an open mind!!!! People that haven't seen the tv series, don't be confused.....it's not that hard to follow, people that HAVE seen the tv series, don't be so judgemental!!! They can't always make everything perfect for the screen.....PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS HAS NO PLOT OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A BRAIN IN THEIR HEAD. LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING ISSUES, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT, CLONING, SCIENCE.

170430,AYWAY5MKLAITN,1415720584,Film Noir Fedora,"[1, 3]","Let me first say that I loved the Aeon Flux series on Mtv. It positively blew my mind. I use to watch this animated cartoon along with the greats. First came THE Maxx, then The State, Then Aeon. But, now that she's been poured into cinematic form, it seems that all the fan-nostalgia has been washed right out of me.Charlize theron, a brillant actress, Chameleon actress, did well in portraying Aeon as a kick-butt assasin who takes her work very seriously. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to play Aeon but her, to be honest.But, alas, looking like a character doesn't necessarily mean that you will embody that character.The story takes place in the very far future as the last remaining humans build a city to house the last survivors of the population. Aeon, mingled in with the society, visits her sister often and has the feeling that the regime has been hiding something. Especially since people are dissapearing with no explanation for it.Now, as I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that it had a similar outline to that of V FOR VENDETTA. But, sadly, this is no V FOR VENDETTA.The action was good and well cherographed, I admit.The costumes and plot were also very well done.If anything, I like the premise and story of this timeless character and movie.But, with this movie, I think they thrusted the audience too fast into the movie without really spending the time or effort in re-telling the backstory of Aeon and the Regime. Some parts I got confused as to whether everything was comprehendible or if it was just me. STAR WARS had a similar approach, introducing gadgets that need no explaination, but Aeon somehow falls flat in this department. It's not that the gagdets aren't well explained, it's just that they seem to almost pop out of nowhere or need MORE explaining.I'm Not saying that I hate the movie. I think that they did a spectacular job . . . but they could've done better. They could've spent more time with the backstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold. Each frame was not like a painting like it was in V FOR VENDETTA.It almost seems, when watching this movie, that they left something out or something was missing for the grand masterpiece. Thankfully, this doesn't hurt Charlize's career in any way but the film needs a lot of work still.I say, that if you are a hardcore Aeon Flux fan, that these things won't matter much. But, if you are a person who has never really been into the series, it may take you a long while to warm up to these characters. You may have to watch the original series and then come back to this movie in order to fully appreciate it more.I'd say that 40% of the movie was hype.Final verdict: Needs more history.

170435,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,1415720584,General Breadbasket,"[0, 0]","Charlize Theron stars in the live action adaption of the Aeon Flux animated series, which originally was on MTV. Here on Australia, the animated series was on really late on a station called SBS, so I've only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, and I thought the adaption might be worth a look. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though.Set a few centuries forward into the future, most of mankind has been wiped out by viruses, and wild jungle has reclaimed the planet. The remainder of humanity resides in a city, heavily controlled and plagued, not by viruses, but by mysterious disappearances and memories that haunt the minds of its citizens in dreams. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a resistance group, determined to have more freedom than they have. Aeon's own resistance becomes all the stronger when her sister is killed by the government. She sets out into the heart of the city, and stumbles on much more than she bargained for, including a lover she never knew she had.I must say I liked the look of the film, and the sets and such were probably what I liked best about the whole thing, a good combination of slick civilization and the lush green of the surrounding jungles and gardens. But looks aren't everything. Even though the film was a modest hour and a half, due to the straight faced dialogue and heavy seriousness over everything, it felt like much, much longer. Seemed to drag, despite the action there didn't seem to be a lot that actually happened. I can understand why the dialogue was the way it was, it adds to the unnatural atmosphere of the city, and it's similar to the way the dialogue is done in the animation, but a bit of humour and warm emotion would have been nice.Special features include two audio commentaries and five behind the scenes featurettes which include footage from the original MTV series. It was good to see the comparison between the film and the cartoon. In making the film, you can see that they have tried to recreate the feel of the film. On the other hand, it doesn't quite capture the more bizarre elements of the animation, which is what made the original series so unique, I reckon.As much as I like science-fiction, and as much as I liked the look of the film, I can't say I liked or recommend this film.

170439,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,1415720584,Godly Gadfly,"[0, 1]","Based on what was orginally an animated series of violent and sexually explicit cartoons, it's well been said that the heroine Aeon Flux is pretty much a female James Bond in an futuristic cyberpunk era.  Aeon lives in an apocalyptic setting, where the world has been decimated by a fatal virus and the 5 million survivors have been living for 400 years in an enclave called Bresna under the leadership of the Goodchild family that saved it.  But conflict emerges when members of the populace start strangely disappearing, and an underground resistance force known as Monicans emerges, in an attempt to assassinate the current leader of the Goodchild clan.  Aeon Flux gets the assignment to take out Goodchild, but in the process makes some startling discoveries that cause her to rethink which side she's on.The primary focus of the film is an action drama, with Aeon Flux and her fellow characters getting lots of camera time doing all kinds of cartwheels and handsprings in the modern setting that is their playground.  It's been said of the animated protagonist that she is ""provocative, sexy, and acrobatic"" - and that's exactly the way Aeon comes to life on the screen as well.  The film was pleasantly free of the crude humor or vulgar language that tends to be combined with this kind of character and action, but expect to see some sexual connotations (with a strong feminine character like Aeon, how can you not?), and lots of violence.  Although most of the victims are faceless, there were occasions where the blood and gore forced me to look away, and it's not surprising that the film got the PG-13 rating it did for this reason.  If the two main protagonists came across somewhat emotionless, they made up for it with the energy of their action and the destruction they cause, particularly Aeon's superhuman acrobatics.The action is backed by a relatively interesting, if not simple plot, which raises some interesting intellectual questions about contemporary ethical issues, cloning in particular.  In a world where the entire population has become infertile, Trevor Goodchild's quest is to find a way for normal pregnancies to happen, but his brother thinks that the status quo where the human race can only be perpetuated by cloning is a utopia that needs no change.  Perhaps nowhere is this better articulated than in the closing stages of the film, where the question is raised about whether a form of immortality achievable through cloning is superior than to a mortal life.  Aeon says: ""We're meant to die. It's the only thing that makes things matter. ... To live once for real, and then give way to people who might do better. To live only once, but with hope.""  The implication seems to be that even if human cloning were ever to be successful, it wouldn't make human life more valuable than it is at present, even with its mortality.This kind of dialogue seems to raise deep questions on an important contemporary issue, and even hints at a moral stand against cloning.  But in reality the film only scratches the surface of it, and never really addresses these serious questions except for raising them in a somewhat vague manner at the very end.  Not that it matters - in the end Aeon Flux is really about cool looking fight scenes and a futuristic spectacle with intense action sequences.  And in the process, like much other science fiction, it shows the illusion of a utopian dream, namely that even if cloning does hold the promise of utopia, it would still result in a world where humans are inherently flawed.  Cloning won't redeem humanity, and Aeon Flux won't redeem the genre of science fiction, but it's a fun ride.

With the number of gifted writers creating meaningful dramas begging for cinematic adaptation burgeoning, why Hollywood continues to make these bloated sci-fi/fantasy driven, flat stories that were only created as static eye candy games in the first place, into movies just begs an answer.  But the incredible aspect of these creations is how the production companies lure some of our best talent into these messes that can't help but taint the artistic choices made by actors and agents.The story is the usual one: world killed by virus except for  a single city isolated from the globe by a set of bad guys whose control must be challenged.  Enter a superhuman, barely clad female teetering between abilities to do the impossible and the instinctive need to maintain 'human values' and Voila! you have a story. The characters are flat, as is appropriate for the original source.  But the visuals are terrific!  There are some really beautiful sets of tasteful design and lighting that serve as the background for the idiotic goings on.And then there are the cast members who hopefully gained a good percentage of the money moviegoers garnered on this thing.  Some of our best actors are here: Charlize Theron, Frances McDormand, Pete Postlethwaite, Sophie Okonedo, Marton Csokas, Jonny Lee Miller, as well as some fine newcomers.  The special effects are good (though nothing new) and the requisite martial arts scenes are well choreographed.  But in the end the viewer is simply left with asking Why...why do these things get made?  Oh yes, public demand and boxoffice success.....Hmmmmm.

170442,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,1415720584,G. Teslovich,"[3, 3]","How I missed this production for five years means it's time for me to leave the cave. The three consistent criticisms, from what I read, were that the costuming was poorly conceived and I would disagree somewhat given how difficult it is and historically has been to portray dress codes that far into the future so why not at least promote Charlize's physical attributes. Second, that the movie isn't faithful to the written comic book series is a common argument for all similar transferences from the printed page to the screen and most viewers regard that as a moot point as the mediums are, in the first place, so different and, secondly, how a story is expressed should be independent in the two mediums. Third, that the forest outside the city was poorly conceived and I say, so what, as the forest was largely superfluous to the main direction of the story.Digression aside, I principally look for creative storytelling in movies including the plot, the props, the sets, the cinematography, the editing/directing, the acting and this movie succeeded on all those criteria.  The story had a moralistic and intellectual theme; the props were visually period appropriate and well conceived; the sets were uniquely futuristic in design and function; the props such as Aeon's rotating eye and modes of communication were all interesting and novel; the camera work contributed to making this alternative dynamic world come across as somewhat realistic and the acting was solid enough. Finally, I noticed that the director's cutting edge work went a little under appreciated. So, director kudos, but a few years late, for delivering an entertaining and thought provoking futuristic action flick.

170443,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1415720584,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","In the future, a lethal disease kills off 99% of the population and what's left of humanity is gathered in the cloistered city of Bregna. Hundreds of years later, Bregna has become a ""perfect"" and sanitized Eden, run by an authoritarian regime. But, of course, every paradise has its infestation and the same is true here. There's something not quite right with the citizens of Bregna; they are plagued with troubling dreams and are gripped with a feeling of unsettledness. Enter Aeon Flux, the most capable and lethal agent of the resistance group aiming to overthrow the government. She is sent to assassinate Trevor Goodchild, the current leader of the ruling establishment. But the seemingly straightforward mission quickly goes awry and Aeon finds herself immersed in an insidious conspiracy centuries old, of which scope threatens to undermine the very bedrock of Bregna's ideal society.So we're back in that old ""been here, done that"" standby of the Utopian world with a fatal flaw. And yet, Aeon Flux is better than I thought it would be. Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I'd seen (and liked, in a bemused sort of way) some of the weird MTV Aeon Flux cartoons of the 1990s, and those shows struck me at the time as being non-linear, bizarre and angular in animation. For one thing, every single episode I saw had our sexy assassin dying. So I was curious to see how the live action film would be interpreted. I gotta admit, I was sold with the very cool opening scene of Aeon's eyelashes Venus-flytrapping a fly.The overall impression I have of the movie is one of aesthetic sleekness. It's visually arresting, with a semi arty-farty approach that recalls to mind The Fifth Element, in terms of its overall design and look. I like the way the filmmakers integrated nature with the futuristic sci-fi elements (Aeon and Sithandra evading literal ""blades"" of grass and tree pods shooting out deadly slivers; Big Brother implementing water in the use of surveillance technology). The special effects are astounding and original looking and alone make the film worth screening. I both liked and got creeped out by Sithandra's four handlike appendages.Unfortunately, the plot is nothing new. And being nothing new, it  commits the unforgivable sin of being dull. The action scenes are fairly trite but are beautifully executed, thanks in large part to the beauty, grace and athleticism of the lead star. She certainly is a credit to the recent slew of butt-kicking females coming out in our media (Buffy, Elektra, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice). Charlize worked out for about 4 months and performs 95% of her own stunts, and that contributes to the film's integral credibility. It's also heartening to witness three females handling the brunt of the action here. The acting...is okay. No one sucks, no one stands out. Because the nature of her internalized character calls for it, Charlize has to come from a minimalist standpoint, acting-wise; her expressive, luminous eyes instead do a lot of emoting. I believe Charlize also is pretty close with her tonal mimicry of Denise Poirier, the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. However, the great Frances Mcdormand is totally wasted in her role as the rebel handler.Special features are comprised of:  2 commentaries (one by the screenwriters, the other by Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd); ""Creating A World: Aeon Flux"", the obligatory ""making of"" documentary, which includes input from creator Peter Chung; a segment on the various locations wherein the film was shot; a stunts documentary breaking down the workout regimen of Charlize and the two other action-oriented actresses; ""Craft of the Set Photographer"", which details the still photographer's job and tools of the trade; and the movie trailer.It's too bad the box office result doesn't seem to warrant a sequel. Aeon Flux has flaws, but Charlize Theron proves to me that she has that certain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures. Great Godfrey, the sight of Charlize Theron in her futuristic scanties is almost worth the price of the dvd alone.",3,Very cool special effects and Charlize becomes an action hero!,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,4166,"['future', 'lethal', 'disease', '99', '%', 'population', 'what', 'left', 'humanity', 'gathered', 'cloistered', 'city', 'Bregna', 'Hundreds', 'years', 'later', 'Bregna', 'become', 'perfect', 'sanitized', 'Eden', 'run', 'authoritarian', 'regime', 'course', 'paradise', 'infestation', 'same', 'true', 'here', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'citizens', 'Bregna', 'are', 'plagued', 'troubling', 'dreams', 'are', 'gripped', 'feeling', 'unsettledness', 'Enter', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'most', 'capable', 'lethal', 'agent', 'resistance', 'group', 'aiming', 'overthrow', 'government', 'sent', 'assassinate', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'current', 'leader', 'ruling', 'establishment', 'seemingly', 'straightforward', 'mission', 'quickly', 'awry', 'Aeon', 'immersed', 'insidious', 'conspiracy', 'centuries', 'old', 'scope', 'undermine', 'very', 'bedrock', 'Bregna', 'ideal', 'society.So', ""'re"", 'back', 'old', 'been', 'here', 'done', 'standby', 'Utopian', 'world', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'yet', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'one', ""'d"", 'seen', 'liked', 'bemused', 'sort', 'way', 'weird', 'MTV', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'cartoons', '1990s', 'shows', 'struck', 'time', 'being', 'non-linear', 'bizarre', 'angular', 'animation', 'one', 'thing', 'single', 'episode', 'saw', 'had', 'sexy', 'assassin', 'dying', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'interpreted', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'was', 'sold', 'very', 'cool', 'opening', 'scene', 'Aeon', 'eyelashes', 'Venus-flytrapping', 'fly.The', 'overall', 'impression', 'have', 'movie', 'one', 'aesthetic', 'sleekness', 'visually', 'arresting', 'semi', 'arty-farty', 'approach', 'mind', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'terms', 'overall', 'design', 'look', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'integrated', 'nature', 'futuristic', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'Aeon', 'Sithandra', 'evading', 'literal', 'blades', 'grass', 'tree', 'pods', 'shooting', 'out', 'deadly', 'slivers', 'Big', 'Brother', 'implementing', 'water', 'use', 'surveillance', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'astounding', 'original', 'looking', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'screening', 'liked', 'got', 'creeped', 'out', 'Sithandra', 'four', 'handlike', 'appendages.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'nothing', 'new', 'being', 'nothing', 'new', 'unforgivable', 'sin', 'being', 'dull', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'trite', 'are', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'beauty', 'grace', 'athleticism', 'lead', 'star', 'certainly', 'credit', 'recent', 'slew', 'butt-kicking', 'females', 'coming', 'out', 'media', 'Buffy', 'Elektra', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Alice', 'Charlize', 'worked', 'out', 'about', '4', 'months', 'performs', '95', '%', 'own', 'stunts', 'film', 'integral', 'credibility', 'also', 'heartening', 'witness', 'three', 'females', 'handling', 'brunt', 'action', 'here', 'acting', 'okay', 'one', 'one', 'out', 'nature', 'internalized', 'character', 'Charlize', 'come', 'minimalist', 'standpoint', 'acting-wise', 'expressive', 'luminous', 'eyes', 'instead', 'do', 'lot', 'emoting', 'believe', 'Charlize', 'also', 'pretty', 'close', 'tonal', 'mimicry', 'Denise', 'Poirier', 'voice', 'animated', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'However', 'great', 'Frances', 'Mcdormand', 'totally', 'wasted', 'role', 'rebel', 'handler.Special', 'features', 'are', 'comprised', '2', 'commentaries', 'one', 'screenwriters', 'other', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'producer', 'Gale', 'Anne', 'Hurd', 'Creating', 'World', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'obligatory', 'making', 'documentary', 'input', 'creator', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'segment', 'various', 'locations', 'wherein', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'stunts', 'documentary', 'breaking', 'down', 'workout', 'regimen', 'Charlize', 'two', 'other', 'action-oriented', 'actresses', 'Craft', 'Set', 'Photographer', 'details', 'still', 'photographer', 'job', 'tools', 'trade', 'movie', 'trailer.It', 'too', 'bad', 'box', 'office', 'result', ""n't"", 'seem', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'flaws', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'certain', 'heroine', 'quality', 'certainly', 'physicality', 'have', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'become', 'franchise', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'Great', 'Godfrey', 'sight', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'futuristic', 'scanties', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'dvd', 'alone']",N/A

I won't discuss its merits as movie.I saw Aeon Flux on 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.This movie is best in BD. Video is noticeably sharper.  However, in colors and audio, the DVD was very well made, its not that far from the BD version.  So if you already own the DVD version, its not that big a leap in quality.Where it matters most are what you expect from BD, more resolution so the lines are cleaner versus jaggy in DVD.  A good DVD player will 'smooth' the jagged edges when possible, so no where is the lines of any image as tack sharp as in BD.This very visible as there are many 'sharp' and contrasting colors used in the movie: the blades of grass, the needle popping out of the grass, Theron's chiseled features, the straight lines of her hair style.The audio is not that striking either in channel separation or dynamic range.Overall, I bought this disk for $10.

It's not that I object to sex and violence, not at all, it's that I think that Hollywood has lost touch, in fact after viewing Aeon Flux I am doubtful they ever had a clue, who was this film aimed at?  Why was a considerable amount of money spent on this incredibly ill-conceived hodgepodge of boring action sequences, absurd psychobabble and endless camera pans leading nowhere, I scarcely know where to begin, what a lame, disappointing mess.  If you saw the previews you have no reason to waste 80+ minutes of your life watching Charlese Theron embarrass herself with stupid green screen stunts, example:  in the future, 2425 or something, our hero and some other girl whose hands have been transplanted to her feet (don't ask) decide to ""sneak"" into future city by running across a field and jumping over the wall, sounds clever, but the city planners decide to defend against such attacks by having some weird pineapple looking things shoot darts at them, note to would be city invaders, learn gymnastics, they help a lot in cases of massive pineapple dart attacks.  You see when said darts start flying, one just needs to do a lot of handsprings and crawl along real fast, then, somehow, you won't be hit.  Oh yeah and one should be sure to climb in the tree and point the shooting darts fruit at the other shooting dart fruit thereby getting the pineapples to shoot each other, just don't step on the grass that shoots up knife blades.  This is a boring retread of every ""break into the bad guys secret hiding place"" ever shot. This was a cult animated show that went off the air years ago for a reason, honest to God they should have had Charlese Theron playing Daria , I would have liked that a lot better.  As I entered the theater I saw a huge pile of posters sitting on the counter, I guess the theater personnel were hoping people would take them, they were free.  Really nice, high quality posters, the big ones, rich color, Charlene the hottie in her little Aeon Flux outfit.  I considered taking one on the way out....then I put it back.

Charlize Theron, Oscar Winner, is evidently too good to wear the more revealing costume Aeon wore in the series.

They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clich?s. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie.In the animated series:Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, and ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.In the movie:Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.The only reason why I'm giving this movie two star is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI. Visually, stylistically, and with its energy and futuristic fantasy (and constantly under-dressed heroine). In that, it reminds me strongly of Fifth Element - another film where we feel as if we only get a glimpse of a futuristic, colorful world full of strangely dressed people, without the need to explain or expose every aspect of it.

I would say this movie is cyberpunk, but it is a little too glossy and well lit [Blade Runner is Cyberpunk].Final Note: this movie is worth 2 hours, and I find myself saying this less and less. It is unique in some of its ideas, and classic/elemental in others. The action is well balanced by good character relationships.

Man I was wrong, to heck with all the negative rubbish, I love it!The film itself is pure fantasy captured on the screen. I felt transported to another world for the time it took me to absorb the story and on a minor vain note I ended up loving Aeon's hairdo- do, it was awesome!Aeon is the equivalent of a bounty hunter in this movie, as she is a part of rebel group called the Monicans. She has a secret mission to kill Goodchild, the chairman who oversees the last surviving place called Bregna as he rules with other scientists. Since 99% of the population was killed by a virus, he is in charge and Aeon with her rebellion are about to change that.What I loved, other than the fantastic costumes and surreal landscapes was the twists and turns in the story! This reminded me of those books I read and loved, when you didn't really know who the bad guy was and that was really going on. You must pay attention as a lot goes! Aeon and Goodchild are caught in a game of cat and mouse and it was enticing to see how they were connected and what the truth would do.The twist start when Aeon if faced with fleeting memories of a previous life that keep her from fulfilling her mission and as the truth is revealed to her, she changes the future of Bregna with the equivalent of taking the bottom block of the foundation out. She lets all the skeletons loose as she jumps, shots, cartwheels, slinks through the night, paralyzes and disarms army men and fights for the truth of her and her people.As I said, I'm not a die hard fan, I've never even seen the series and I absolutely let the movie swallow my brain and possess my interest till the end credit.

When Aeon Flux was released I read reviews saying that if you've never seen the anime series that this is a hard movie not only to understand but also to sit through since you don't really know that much about it's past. This film feels like it's bringing closure to it's fans and all that says is that it's only for fans. Besides the fact that I attempted to watch this movie a little blind somehow it started to get a little boring and it wasn't because of the story. As much as I love Charlize she played this character too stiff. The rest of the cast was very weak especially Trevor (Marton Csokas) and I thought he would play the part pretty good.In the beginning they do their best to let newcomers know what's going on in the films past and present, they do a pretty good job informing and you're not all that in the dark. Aeon Flux's intelligence and cinematography actually start to exceed the actor's talents and it becomes a little hard for them to handle. The camera angles could have been a lot better, a lot of times your missing good fight scenes because the camera is somewhere else other than the action. Overall Aeon Flux could have been done better than this; it's missing a lot of key elements. The story is very appealing but this film missed the potential the live action movie should have.

This is the same thing that happened with similar sci-fi flicks including ""The Island"" and ""V For Vendetta"" -- they all revolve around futuristic societies where the action takes place after war or other calamity.In ""Aeon Flux"" the society is set in 2415 after a plague has taken all but 5 million residents (who all seem beautiful and able to speak English.) They reside inside a walled society that separates them from a world nature has taken over -- similar to ""The Island"", where all the inhabitants tried their best to get to the island without knowing they were stuck inside a tiny little world.Star Charlize Theron is magnificent in the James Bond-ish lead role as a member of the underground fighting to overthrow the leadership -- not unlike the Zorro-like character in ""V For Vendetta"" whose goal was to topple the totalitarian government in place in England.Theron gets an assignment to assassinate a member of the ruling party and the action takes a decided turn in another direction. She recalls a previous life with this guy and doesn't kill him. She ends up in prison, escapes, kills some people, meets him again, and finds out more about their collective past -- all in the time it took my wife to go to the bathoroom!At this point the story changes changes and, without disclosing much, the notion of cloning begins to play a major role. This separates those that want to go backward to the old way (revolutionaries) from those that want to keep things the way they are now (ruling party). I don't recall what happened at the end of the flick so I can't spoil that for you.""Aeon Flux"" has many fine and involving moments of action and imaginative scenes, has many wonderful sets, is marvelously lit, and benefits from a fine actress in the lead role whose outfits will keep male viewers attached to the screen if not to the storyline. That last thing, the story, becomes a bit bizarre and borders on incoherence once or twice during the telling of the story, so expect to be confused on occasion.The bottom line: ""Aeon Flux"" is a visual treat and somewhat entertaining as 21st century sci-fi with all its technical details in place. It is neither a film for the ages nor in any way individual compared to other movies of its type that have been made in recent years.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","The world of ""Aeon Flux"" is set in the year 2415, which is basically four centuries after 99% of the human race was wipe out by a deadly virus.  What is left of humanity is living in Bregna, a protected city that is ruled by the wealthy Goodchild family and we find out that are 5 million people living in that city: which is the same number of survivors left alive when the plague was done killing off people.  Clearly life in the future is carefully controlled, and of course there are those who do not like the arrangement and who are committed to doing something about it, namely bring the whole thing down.  So, once again, a sterile futuristic world is challenged by those who sensibilities are more in keeping with our own.  If only somebody in the future had an actual personality, this 2005 film would be a lot more palatable.The Monicans are the rebels in this society and their primary goal is to kill the Goodchild brothers, Trevor (Marton Csokas), who is the leader, and Oren (Jonny Lee Miller), the second in command.  The killing machine Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron, reduced to playing a walking manikin) is the best agent for the Monicans, receiving her missions from the Handler (Frances McDormand), and working with her partner, Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo).  After her sister, Una (Amerlia Warner) is killed by the government, Aeon goes right after Trevor Goodchild in his Citadel to assassinate him.  But the ultimate confrontation involves Aeon finding out some information that terms the world upside down and sideways.  This is not actually that surprising, because the vibe we pick up from the bad guy is that he is not the sort of evil megalomaniac we expect to see running a futuristic world.There are some interesting things about this world, from capsules you swallow so you can receive other people's thoughts to learning a pointed lesson about why you do not walk on the grass in this brave new world.  The problem is that while there are things of interesting in this film, I never found ""Aeon Flux"" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.  Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.  To make things worse, the more I thought about it the more I was disappointed that given what is really going on what happens in the movie was not more interesting.  After all, this society has been spinning its wheels for four centuries just to get up to this decidedly underwhelming climax.

I liked the inside references to specific episodes & the effort of trying to make sence of the original story by making connections. I also like how the characters who barely lasted 5 minutes before getting killed in the series got a longer role in the movie; that was cute.

All of that stuff was supposed to happen over years, not a week or less.

There are simply too many changes; it was like watching X-Men after growing up with the comic &/or animated series. I won't say what; some of it is coverd by the Wikipedia, the rest you can find out yourself by watching the series.

Or... this is what the Next Generation movies could have been.And my interpretation of the bad reviews: that stuffy old white men who write the reviews (Ebert, etc) don't understand edgy movies. They didn't understand Matrix at first, either.I didn't know there was a series before I saw the movie. People who say it didn't make sense at first are too used to brainless Hollywood flicks, serving you a formulaic plot on a platter.This plot was not difficult to understand - the movie asks for your patience the first 30 minutes, as the story unfolds. It's a futuristic mystery, people! Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately. It's a mildly (and pleasantly) complex story. If you want a Steven Siegal or Schwarzenegger action flick, look elsewhere.And only the first half of the movie is the ""mystery"". It takes about an hour for the plot, the characters, and the futuristic setting to unfold. Then the movie evolves into a stunning action flick.Thing I loved about this movie:-Srong female characters-Excellent soundtrack-Extremely interesting visually-Extremely creative sci-fi contributions (like the arm-to-leg transplants)-Thoughtful cinematography-A very strong cast-Artistic sets & effects-Creative weapons & futuristic props-A truly unique story - it didn't try to copy anything (which probably confused the Hollywood lemmings out there)My only complaint - it needed more in spots. Particularly, more character development for other members of the resistance. If you've seen it...I believe they jumped the gun getting to the last ""sniper"" scene.

170487,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,1415720584,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 2]","""Aeon Flux"" is one of those rare films that gets universally negative reviews from critics who are normally used to 'epics' such as ""Out of Africa"" or ""Terms of Endearment"". It takes a different sort of mind to appreciate science fiction, because the genre is rare at giving us true classics. That said, if you liked David Lynchs' dark and disturbing film version of ""Dune"", then you will certainly find much to like in ""Aeon Flux"".The film runs like the fractured tale of a universe in peril, and one woman seems to hold the key and the balance between two insane realities. Charlize Theron really brings it as the lead character, and they really prop her well with the choicest special effects and the most liberal use of CGI, though in an appropriate manner. Theron has always been a good actress, but her stiff, warrior-like role here will win over the most jaded of science fiction fans, simply because there is no comparison (Milla Jovovich in ""Ultraviolet"" comes close, but that was more pop-art than dystopian art).The storyline is bleak, yet hopeful, and the multiple realities really make the film work even in areas where the script might sometimes let it down. There are issues with it, yes, but I think that it only works in making the film truly a work of art, because unlike other films in the genre, it doesn't cheapen science fiction, but rather glorifies it as a true vision of the future, much like the classic SF novels of the 1960s (remember Roger Zelazny?)""Aeon Flux"" deserves five stars, and a really good projection system, because the visuals in this movie are just so clear, stunning and memorable, and this is one movie you can watch again and again - which in my book is the hallmark of a true classic.",5,Stunning : A Science Fiction Masterpiece,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1730,"['Flux', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'universally', 'negative', 'reviews', 'critics', 'who', 'are', 'normally', 'used', ""'epics"", 'such', 'Africa', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'different', 'sort', 'mind', 'appreciate', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'rare', 'giving', 'true', 'classics', 'said', 'liked', 'David', 'Lynchs', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'film', 'version', 'Dune', 'then', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'Aeon', 'Flux', '.The', 'film', 'runs', 'fractured', 'tale', 'universe', 'peril', 'one', 'woman', 'hold', 'key', 'balance', 'two', 'insane', 'realities', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'really', 'lead', 'character', 'really', 'prop', 'well', 'choicest', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'liberal', 'use', 'CGI', 'though', 'appropriate', 'manner', 'Theron', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'actress', 'stiff', 'warrior-like', 'role', 'here', 'will', 'win', 'most', 'jaded', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'simply', 'comparison', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Ultraviolet', 'close', 'was', 'more', 'pop-art', 'dystopian', 'art', '.The', 'storyline', 'bleak', 'yet', 'hopeful', 'multiple', 'realities', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'even', 'areas', 'where', 'script', 'might', 'sometimes', 'let', 'down', 'are', 'issues', 'yes', 'think', 'only', 'making', 'film', 'truly', 'work', 'art', 'other', 'films', 'genre', ""n't"", 'cheapen', 'science', 'fiction', 'rather', 'glorifies', 'true', 'vision', 'future', 'much', 'classic', 'SF', 'novels', '1960s', 'remember', 'Roger', 'Zelazny', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'five', 'stars', 'really', 'good', 'projection', 'system', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'clear', 'stunning', 'memorable', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'book', 'hallmark', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

170490,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,1415720584,Marshall Lord,"[2, 4]","This is a clever adaptation of an MTV animated cartoon series.I found it more plausible than the original, which is not saying much.In favour of this movie, the action sequences are stunning, the film is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever scene (partly due to the sets and partly to the lead star, Charlize Theron in the title role). The characters are also more understandable and less morally ambiguous than the MTV original, and the actors brought them to life quite well.Against this movie, the plot is still pretty implausible and sometimes also hard to follow.The story is set 500 years from now, after humanity was almost entirely wiped out by a virus in the early 21st century. We are told at the beginning that a Dr Goodchild found the cure which saved the human race from annihilation, and that 500 years later ""the Goodchild regime"" is still in power.After all that time there are still only 5 million people on earth, all in just one city. This may seem very strange but of the many apparently unlikely things in the story this is one of the few for which the plot does eventually provide an internally consistent explanation.In the original MTV series there were two or more human nations and the ""Monicans,"" including the title role character, who were often  working against the government of the city where the story is set, were the agents of a rival city.In this version there is only one city and ""Monicans"" like Aeon Flux are an underground resistance movement against what appears at first to be a highly repressive regime. In the original, the head of state, Chairman Trevor Goodchild, had recently come to power by removing the elected leader, in the film he has been in office for a long time - you'll have to watch it to find out just how long.Aeon Flux is the principal Monican agent: shortly after the start of the film she gets orders to assassinate Chairman Goodchild. In the process of attempting this mission she finds that the regime holds secrets which are even stranger than she thought, and neither friends nor foe are who she thought they were.Charlize Theron gets to wear some very strange outfits and mostly very attractive outfits in this film, some of them obviously inspired by the wierd outfits from the original cartoon series, though mostly not as indecent as some of the cartoon costumes were.Ms Theron looks very good indeed in most of these costumes but they are often ridiculously imappropriate for the missions she is carrying out. For example, who in their right mind would send an agent on a secret mission wearing a bondage costume which will draw every male eye in a millisecond and looks like it belongs on a catwalk?And what kind of idiot would carry out a night-time infiltration mission to sabotage an ultra-high security installation wearing an all-white outfit ?The movie also suffers in plausibility from the classic ""Hollywood rules"" of weapon accuracy and ammunition supply. Whenever the good guys fire a weapon they almost always hit what they are shooting at, but when either a bad guy or a computer controlled weapon system shoots at one of the heroes or heroines they almost always miss or hit a non-vital spot. And none of the good guys ever runs out of ammunition until a suitable point in the plot to show them changing a cartridge during a piece of dialogue.Despite all these implausibilities the film can carry you along and I did enjoy watching it once.

I must admit, I am not familiar with the animated series or comic serials this film is based on.  My review is primarily from a Charlize Theron fan's point of view.  The story, the characters, the special effect and the overall mood of the story are all a bit unexpected.As a film, Aeon Flux does not disappoint.  It combines great characters, a complex plot, and great special effects in an entertaining format that zips by in a 92 minutes.  The alternate society is a varied theme that generally creates a blank canvas for writers and directors to play with freely.  Here, Kusama, Manfredi, Chung, and Hay step up to answer the call well.  Action begins quickly and integrates viewers in an alternate world rather quickly.  It is a strange world though.Aeon portrays a rogue assassin who betrays her mission when unanswered questions collide with residual memories of another lifetime.  Coincidence and circumstance lead her into a precarious position between future and past.  In the end, her decision demonstrates heroic wisdom and courage demanded of a science-fiction character. Theron captures Aeon's character well.Charlize Theron is sexy, smart, and daring. Her ability to present Aeon's conflict is genuine.  She also stands alone as a unique hero in a complex universe.  This modern Hollywood princess skillfully uses all action, dialogue, and pacing. Her physical beauty harmonizes well with her grace and athletic prowess.  Charlize Theron is a fantastic actor.The plot is interesting.  I certainly didn't expect events to unfold as they did.  I do like the pace and fluidity involved.  The pivotal scene in which Aeon must convince Sith Andra her intentions are pure is a little sudden, but definitely not forced.  I believe a little history leading up to Aeon's mission would have been well worth the extra time it would have added to the movie.

170497,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,1415720584,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 6]","Ever since I saw Peter Chung's creation mow down piles of enemies with her two Uzis, a leather S&M; get up, and little else, I fell in love.  Aeon Flux was bizarre, action-packed, and short on words (actually, almost none at all when she first debuted on Liquid T.V.).  I watched it over and over, I drew Aeon multiple times until I got her right, and the breakneck pace that was established in the film still affects my writing to this day.So it was with no small trepidation that I approached the Aeon Flux movie.  How could they possibly do justice to a bizarre series that was as much a style as it was a cartoon, alternately ugly and sleekly beautiful all at the same time?Taking place in 2415, Aeon (Charlize Theron sporting a brunette `do) is an agent of the Monicans.  The Monicans wage a secret war against Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas), a well-meaning despot who struggles to keep the fragile city of Bregna together.  The Earth has long since been devastated by a plague, and there are only five million survivors left in the city. And yet there's something rotten in the city of Bregna, for Trevor's brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) is about to stage a coup.After her sister Una (Amelia Warner) is murdered, Aeon's out for revenge against the supposed despot. Assisting Aeon in her mission of revenge is Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) who happens to have hands for feet.  And yet when she finally faces her target, Aeon discovers there's something very familiar about Trevor that gives her pause.Aeon Flux was directed by a woman (Karyn Kusama) and her sensibilities bring a refreshing touch to a genre that is all too muscular, boxy, and grim. Like The Fifth Element, Aeon Flux is an entry in a science fiction genre that avoids the standard futuristic tropes and injects new and bizarre technology into it.  Body modification, as evidenced by Sithandra, is an accepted part of sciety.  Technology is organic, ranging from killer grass to dart guns shaped like beehives, computers made of water to holograms formed of harp-like strings.  All the Monican agents are linked by a telepathic connection that lets them visualize each other in a sort of World Wide Web of the mind. Fashion styles are reminiscent of French couture. A zeppelin computer that looms overhead has all the appearance of a monstrous jellyfish. Even the city looks like a giant carnation from above.Aeon herself is played with deadly seriousness by Theron, who draws on her ballerina training to adopt a dancer's pose. Her martial arts is as much an art form as it is combat style, and the graceful leaps and jumps that the cartoon version effortlessly executed are much in evidence here; an amazing achievement, given that the original character's proportions barely conformed to reality.So what's the problem?  Critics lambasted the film, characterizing it as too complicated.  It's difficult for me to agree with them, because fans of the show will know precisely what's going on...and yet the movie wasn't spoiled for me either.  In fact, the biggest flaw of the film is the motive for Oren to ""recycle"" people in the city of Bregna. His ""my way or else"" proposition isn't really justified in the movie's narrative, such that we just have to trust that there's simply no room for compromise between the two ideologies battling it out on screen.  But once you're past that hurdle, the film is as much eye-candy as it is an interesting post-apocalyptic entry into alternative sci-fi.The backlash on this film is suspicious.  Perhaps it was Theron's Oscar win. Perhaps it's simply that many critics don't like science fiction.  Or perhaps it's that a truly feminist take on a science fiction world makes male reviewers uncomfortable.  Whatever the case, sci-fi fans should definitely give Aeon Flux a chance.",4,Sci-Fan Should Give Aeon a Chance,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,3790,"['Ever', 'saw', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'creation', 'mow', 'piles', 'enemies', 'two', 'Uzis', 'leather', 'S', 'M', 'get', 'up', 'little', 'else', 'fell', 'love', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'was', 'bizarre', 'action-packed', 'short', 'words', 'actually', 'almost', 'none', 'when', 'first', 'debuted', 'Liquid', 'T.V.', 'watched', 'drew', 'Aeon', 'multiple', 'times', 'got', 'right', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'was', 'established', 'film', 'still', 'writing', 'day.So', 'was', 'small', 'trepidation', 'approached', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'movie', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'do', 'justice', 'bizarre', 'series', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'style', 'was', 'cartoon', 'alternately', 'ugly', 'sleekly', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'Taking', 'place', '2415', 'Aeon', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'sporting', 'brunette', 'do', 'agent', 'Monicans', 'Monicans', 'wage', 'secret', 'war', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'Martin', 'Csokas', 'well-meaning', 'despot', 'who', 'keep', 'fragile', 'city', 'Bregna', 'together', 'Earth', 'long', 'been', 'devastated', 'plague', 'are', 'only', 'five', 'million', 'survivors', 'left', 'city', 'yet', 'something', 'rotten', 'city', 'Bregna', 'Trevor', 'brother', 'Oren', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'stage', 'coup.After', 'sister', 'Una', 'Amelia', 'Warner', 'murdered', 'Aeon', 'out', 'revenge', 'supposed', 'despot', 'Assisting', 'Aeon', 'mission', 'revenge', 'Sithandra', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'who', 'have', 'hands', 'feet', 'yet', 'when', 'finally', 'target', 'Aeon', 'something', 'very', 'familiar', 'Trevor', 'pause.Aeon', 'Flux', 'was', 'directed', 'woman', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'sensibilities', 'bring', 'refreshing', 'touch', 'genre', 'too', 'muscular', 'boxy', 'grim', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'entry', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'standard', 'futuristic', 'tropes', 'new', 'bizarre', 'technology', 'Body', 'modification', 'evidenced', 'Sithandra', 'accepted', 'part', 'sciety', 'Technology', 'organic', 'ranging', 'killer', 'grass', 'dart', 'guns', 'shaped', 'beehives', 'computers', 'made', 'water', 'holograms', 'formed', 'harp-like', 'strings', 'Monican', 'agents', 'are', 'linked', 'telepathic', 'connection', 'visualize', 'other', 'sort', 'World', 'Wide', 'Web', 'mind', 'Fashion', 'styles', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'French', 'couture', 'zeppelin', 'computer', 'appearance', 'monstrous', 'jellyfish', 'Even', 'city', 'giant', 'carnation', 'above.Aeon', 'played', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'Theron', 'who', 'ballerina', 'training', 'adopt', 'dancer', 'pose', 'martial', 'arts', 'as', 'much', 'art', 'form', 'combat', 'style', 'graceful', 'leaps', 'jumps', 'cartoon', 'version', 'effortlessly', 'executed', 'are', 'much', 'evidence', 'here', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'given', 'original', 'character', 'proportions', 'barely', 'conformed', 'reality.So', 'what', 'problem', 'Critics', 'lambasted', 'film', 'characterizing', 'too', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'agree', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'know', 'precisely', 'what', 'going', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'fact', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'motive', 'Oren', 'recycle', 'people', 'city', 'Bregna', 'way', 'else', 'proposition', ""n't"", 'really', 'justified', 'movie', 'narrative', 'such', 'just', 'have', 'trust', 'simply', 'room', 'compromise', 'two', 'ideologies', 'battling', 'out', 'screen', 'once', ""'re"", 'hurdle', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'eye-candy', 'interesting', 'post-apocalyptic', 'entry', 'alternative', 'sci-fi.The', 'backlash', 'film', 'suspicious', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Theron', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Perhaps', 'simply', 'many', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'science', 'fiction', 'perhaps', 'truly', 'feminist', 'take', 'science', 'fiction', 'world', 'male', 'reviewers', 'uncomfortable', 'Whatever', 'case', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'chance']",N/A

Was it a classic sci-fi in the league of ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"" or others? No. On the other hand, it was not that bad either, to be honest.The premise is that about 99% of all humanity has been wiped out in a great plague and that there is only one city left: Bregna. In Bregna, people live in a healthy, utopian dream and they never venture outside the walls. The city is ruled by one family, the Goodchilds, who rule in benevolent guidance and look after everyone. Or so it seems. The Monicans are the resistance to the Goodchilds and work acts of violence and destruction.This movie has some definite things going for it, besides Charlize Theron in some very revealing clothing. The action sequences are excellent, and they are of the highest quality. On this basis alone, ""Aeon Flux"" could hold its own against most other films with fight sequences in them. The action is also fairly high paced, with few periods of dry or dull monotony.The special effects are also excellently executed, and worth a look. The creativity of different weapons and gadgets would satisfy most Trekkies, I think. The advanced technology portrayed was not so different from our own time, with some recognisable items there. However, it was different enough to give you something of the unreal and dreamlike.The striking thing for this viewer was the contrast between the frenetic intensity of the Monicans with their drive to rebel, and the mindless acceptance of everything by the majority of the population. Later in the movie, even this contrast is shattered when Aeon Flux starts to question the mission that she is sent on by the Monican Handler. Black and white/Them and us start to take on a more blurred aspect, complicating a simple dichotomy of friend and foe. The movie succeeds in raising some issues for thought.I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny. If I had a criticism of the movie, that would be it. I was left feeling a little less than satisfied with the way that the movie resolved itself. However, taken overall, I would have to say that this is more than counterbalanced by the earlier parts of the movie.In short, be cautious if you are buying it, I would not watch it a lot of times, but it is worth a couple of viewings, at least. I would not be shy on the hiring side of it, and see what you think.

The more you enjoyed the animation, the less you will like this film.However, the production elements are truly amazing. The sets and costumes are all eye popping. The film also explores some fun futuristic concepts like telepathic message pills, plants engineered as weapons, and liquid memory pools. If you enjoyed the art direction of ""I, Robot"" and ""The Island"", you will enjoy looking at this film too.While Charlize Theron is one of the most beautiful actresses of today, she's simply miscast. In the animation, Aeon Flux is a lithe sinewy gymnast composed of harsh angles. Miss Theron is simply too curvy to play such a sculpted boney-butt warrior.

170513,A1BXRM9U3XTLCJ,1415720584,"Nina Munteanu ""SF Girl""","[1, 2]","When I was first tantalized by the high-speed trailor for the 2005 Paramount motion picture, Aeon Flux, directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), I was blissfully unaware of its history: that it was based on the darkly irreverant and raunchy 1995 MTV Liquid Television animated SF series created by Korean American animator, Peter Chung. The series achieved cult status among a select audience of imsoniacs (it played at midnight on MTV, if that tells you anything). This may have worked in my favour. I had no expectations or preconceptions, except for a hair-flying ride. As a result, when the content (written by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay) had merit as social commentary, I counted it as a bonus.In typical dystopian fashion, we join the Aeon Flux story roughly four hundred years after an industrial-related virus has killed 99% of the world's population. Scientist, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) has developed a cure and the Goodchild dynasty secures a home for the five million survivors in the last city on Earth, Bregna, a paradise walled off from the unrestrained wilderness that ever-threatens them. Dystopias, like Bregna, often appear utopian on the surface, exhibiting a world free of poverty, hardship and conflict, but with some fatal flaw at their core. Built from scientific premise and intended only as a temporary measure, the technocratic society of Bregna continues long after its intended span as the Goodchilds attempt to deal with an internal and enduring glitch (infertility) of the ""cure"". Like most imposed provisional governments, this one's solution to a problem (cloning) has created yet another problem (fugitive memories from the previous clone's life).It is now 2415 and the walled society of Bregna appears utopian--clean and organized, beautiful, rich and spatious; but beneath the laughter and contentment, stirs an uneasy disquiet. Bregnans are losing sleep, having bad dreams, and are plagued by memories that don't belong to them. Rebels challenge the Goodchild regime, run by Trevor and his brother Oren, and among the rebels is a highly competent and ruthless assassin, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), whose tools include whistle-controlled ball-bearing bombs, drugs that allow her to meet people on higher planes of existence, and interchangeable eyeballs. She is aptly named, as she serves a true agent of discord to Goodchild, the guardian of order and all that he navely believes is good.""Some call Bregna the perfect society,"" Aeon tells us in the opening scenes of the motion picture, ""Some call it the height of human civilization...but others know better...We are haunted by sorrows we cannot name. People disappear and our government denies these crimes...But there are rebels who...fight for the disappeared. They call themselves the Monicans. I am one of them."" Several critics disliked the narrative introduction. I found that it particularly worked, by adding a reflective literary quality to the motion picture. It is noteworthy that in the original animated series, Trevor Goodchild often frames each episode with his reflections; only fitting that Aeon gets her chance in the film version. The reflective narrative of the motion picture is meant to enlighten its audience that this is not your ordinary action thriller. What follows is a fast-paced yet thoughtful story, with elements of romance, that explores notions of longevity, social structure and connection, faith and greed to a satisfying end.Twitchfilm.net aptly called the motion picture ""biological science fiction"". Says Oren, Trevor's treacherous brother who betrays him: ""We've beaten death. We've beaten nature."" The film's clean organic high-tech look faithfully captures the ""sense of biotech gone wild"" of the TV series by exploring several paradigms inherent in a society that lives deliberately in the absense of nature's chaos. Indeed, the lack of connectivity resonates throughout the motion picture in its exploration of friendship, family, loyalty, and purpose. When her sister is murdered in the beginning of the film supposedly by Trevor's men (but in actuality by his scheming brother, Oren), Aeon's mission becomes personal: ""I had a family once. I had a life; now all I have is a mission.""The film truly launches into stylish action and intrigue when Aeon gladly accepts a mission to assassinate Trevor, thinking that this violent act will make it all better. Instead, it unravels her, beginning with when she confronts him; finding him uncomfortably familiar and alluring, she hesitates and decides not to kill him. ""What do you want?"" Trevor asks her. ""I want my sister back. I want to remember what it's like to be a person."" It is indeed he--or rather what he knows--that holds the key to who she is. The key is that she, like he and all those in Bregna, is a 400 year-old copy of someone before the virus. Four hundred years ago she was the original Trevor's wife.Filmed in Berlin, the movie is visually stunning, from the opening shot on the steps of Sans Souci to the labrinthine wind canal used by the Nazis. Displaying an eclectic mixture of spareness and mid-century design the film is acted out in a fluid dance to Graeme Revell's (Sin City) haunting score. The action is rivetting and seamless with both plot and underlying theme of bio-tech gone awry. Early on we are treated to a thrilling sequence of Aeon and her biotech-altered rebel colleague negotiating the security of Goodchild's sanctuary that consists of a beautiful but deadly garden, guarded by patches of knife-sharp blades of grass and poison dart-spitting fruit trees.Aeon champions moral ethics and single-handedly destroys the relicor, the supposetory of the clone DNA, pursuing honour at the expense of loyalty (to Goodchild) and heralding in a new age of ""mortality"". The movie ends as it begins, with Aeon's narrative: ""Now we can move forward. To live once for real and then give way to people who might do it better...to live only once but with hope."" This is truly what Aeon Flux represents and what her very name embodies.",4,Action Thriller with Depth--Biological Science Fiction,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,6043,"['When', 'was', 'first',

Wait, before you groan and move on hear me out:Both are set in post apocalyptic futures.Both are filmed with a 1940ies style.Both are dealing with the issues of death and what it means to be alive.Both movies end on an uncertain, yet hopeful note....But everything in-between is, intentionally, different. Technology in the world of Aeon Flux is almost organic, society lives in a utopian world, architecture is all smooth and curved, and everything seems to be in harmony with everything else until you dig below the surface. The best example of this is the total absence of view screens; anytime someone watches a video of something it looks as if the video being reflected off the surface of water. Its great little touches like that that give this movie a unique style.Charlize Theron was amazing in the lead role not just for her believability but for the amount of stunts she did on her own and the training she went through. This was her first film after Monster and, while she had lost the weight, she wasn't in good shape when she got the part. It took months of physical training for her to be healthy enough for Aeon Flux, and her dedication and hard work shows.Watching this film the second time was even more fun; with the plot twists all known I could focus on the extra touches that I didn't consciously notice the first time around - How Aeon's jagged, anime-style haircut set her apart from the smooth, curving society around her. Camera angles and dialogue pauses that hint at the secret that this utopian world was built on. Subtle biblical references to the expulsion from paradise...

Although I hadn't seen the animated version, nor was familiar with the storyline, after watching the movie, I must say that I didn't find it as bad as I thought I would.In the year 2011, a deadly virus killed most of the population. Trevor Goodchild, a scientist, developed a cure for the disease, and the rest of the survivors lived in Bregna, the last city on Earth. We now go to 400 years later, where there are some unusual incidents taking place in Bregna. Rebels known as the Monicans are challenging the Goodchild regime and trying to bring it down, as they feel that Goodchild has something to do with the incidents. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is one of them. Her main aim is to get rid of Trevor Goodchild, but things get really complicated during her mission, as she starts to remember things that she doesn't remember happening. She wants to get to the bottom of what is really going on, and that is what the rest of the movie is all about.It's too bad the critics are trashing this movie. Personally, I found it a little slow and difficult to understand at first, but after the first 10 minutes, things start becoming very interesting. The special effects are amazing and very life-like, such as Sithandra's `modifications', the city of Bregna, Goodchild's library, etc. Ok, so Charlize is not playing her usual `Oscar winning' role here, but I think she acted very well as Aeon. Just because someone wins an Academy Award doesn't mean that they have to stick to only those types of roles; if that was the case, then there would be no versatility. Similarly, even Sophie Okonedo (after seeing her wonderful performance in Hotel Rwanda) acted fine as Sithandra. The rest of the cast did well for their roles, but nothing great.True, the storyline is unique, and this might not be a movie for everyone, but you should at least give it a chance.

This movie was visually stimulating -- both the action and the scenery. It was fast paced, action packed, and had a plot, that although not completely new (what plot is?), or difficult to understand, it unraveled in such a way that kept you guessing most of the way through and then, put it together nicely.The one drawback, for me anyway, was the romantic connection between the leads. Although the romantic link, when made, was a strong one and pivotal to the plot, I did not feel that it was as convincing as it should have been. Unlike many reviewers, I think the movie should have been longer to explore more of the background of the characters and the resistance and, to find out how those fantastic women came by their extraordinary athletic powers.The movie makers did a good job of making a futuristic city. It was not full of flying cars or space ships -- simply a city in the future -- a type of ""New World"". (That's one of the things I liked about John Boorman's ZARDOZ.) Considering that the movie was shot in Berlin using buildings that were pre World War II (some over 150 years old) that was quite a feat and a nice touch.Some reviewers I've read thought some of the technology was too futuristic, perhaps beyond plausibility.

its' citizens who meet perfect strangers have inexplicable remnant memories of them;some good,some bad.Our heroine Aeon Flux(Charlize Theron)is part of a rebel group called The Monacans who are fighting to end the Goodchild regime,by any means.Monacans are genetically and drug enhanced humans with superior strength and speed.They also can contact one another and/or their leader ""The

her hesitation causes her to be caught.Not for long as she escapes and returns to meet with Trevor.They make love and after a brief sleep Aeon wakes up and chokes Trevor to near death.She leaves and realizes that her answer may lay in an object that circles the city in the sky called the""Relico"".It is a flying ship supposedly built to remind the inhabitants of their sacrifices but she thinks there is more to it.She gets aboard and finds out the whereabouts of her sister and leaves.Trevor who has followed behind now knows what she was after and finds out even more information he didn't know of.He meets Aeon at the location of her sister to find that the sister is now a baby.Trevor reveals that she has been cloned;in fact everyone has been cloned over the past 400 years.He also says the real reason her sister was killed was that she was pregnant,naturally.Nature has found a cure on its own for the sterile plagued society and Trevors'brother Oren wants to keep the information from getting out,thus all the kidnappings,disappearances and deaths.Oren has also condemned Trevor to death as a traitor for sleeping with Aeon and both are now wanted fugitives.Aeon herself has also been handed a death sentence seperately by her own Monacan organization for not carrying out her mission.After a bloodied battle with Oren's forces who fight not only Trevor and Aeon but other Monacan snipers,the two barely escape with their lives.Aeon again climbs aboard the ""Relico"" and blows the ship up,sending it crashing into  a section of city wall and exposing the outside forested world to the startled inhabitants.The citizens now free of the Goodchild oppression can now start to live their lives anew.The film is filled with spectacular stunts and CGI effects throughout and some sequences are amazing to watch.One especially delightful sequence is with a friend,the hand-footed Zathandra,as they attempt to cross the rolling grassy landscape towards the Citadel.With incredible jumps by the pair punctuated by deadly gourds with shooting syringes of poison and the grass,which becomes seemingly alive when a human presence is detected-going from blades of grass to razor sharp blades of steel.It is certainly both an aural and visual feast to be sure.But the plot keeps you intrigued and interested,I found,throughout the picture with very few let ups.And more importantly this film is one you can watch over and over and still find something just a little different each time.The picture here is top notch,crisp and clear all the way and with that wonderful sound available in D/Surround 5.1 or 2.0.The special features abound:Commentary by Theron and producer Gale Hurd or by co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi,""Creating a World:Aeon Flux""(20 m),""Location of

170528,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1415720584,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","AEon Flux (Karyn Kusama, 2005)I'm a very big fan of both Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and Charlize Theron (Monster). So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it. Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having ""gone back to nature."" The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up. AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas). Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns. And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects. (Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather. Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really. But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't. **",2,"Silly, mindless, and iconoclastic.",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,1665,"['AEon', 'Flux', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', '2005', ""'m"", 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'Girlfight', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Monster', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'big-screen', 'adaptation', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'series', 'AEon', 'Flux', 'would', 'star', 'Theron', 'be', 'directed', 'Kusama', 'was', 'hopeful', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'teeth', 'Alas', 'everyone', 'world', 'seemingly', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong.Theron', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'world', 'five', 'million', 'inhabitants', 'live', 'single', 'city', 'world', 'having', 'gone', 'back', 'nature', 'city', 'been', 'ruled', 'benevolent', 'dictator', 'most', 'four', 'hundred', 'years', 'things', 'have', 'started', 'getting', 'little', 'weird', 'rebel', 'faction', 'Monicans', 'sprung', 'up', 'AEon', 'Flux', 'member', 'Monican', 'resistance', 'assignment', 'handler', 'Fargo', 'Frances', 'MacDormand', 'assassinate', 'said', 'dictator', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'xXx', 'Martin', 'Csokas', 'well', 'something', 'hesitate', 'something', 'vast', 'coincidence', 'entire', 'film', 'turns', 'once', 'accept', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handed', 'vast', 'coincidence', 'whole', 'thing', 'simply', 'apart', 'becoming', 'nothing', 'more', 'excuse', 'mindless', 'shoot-em-up', 'sorts', 'nifty', 'special', 'effects', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'feet', 'replaced', 'second', 'set', 'hands', 'recipient', 'far', 'coolest', 'film', 'effects', 'So', 'short', 'answer', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'do', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'few', 'yards', 'skintight', 'leather', 'Which', 'admit', 'could', 'have', 'even', 'made', 'Reds', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'be', 'prepared', 'fact', 'Girlfight', 'ai', ""n't"", '**']",N/A

170530,A16QODENBJVUI1,1415720584,Robert Moore,"[40, 48]","OK, so this is not a masterpiece, but this is not nearly as bad as I would have expected given the horrid reviews by both critics and moviegoers when it first came out.  The real question, I believe, is not why people think this is so good, but why anyone imagines that the graphic novel and the MTV animated series based upon it were so great.  In all three cases the basic story had plot holes you could drive an armada of eighteen-wheelers through, all three were based vastly more on style than substance, and all three were more about how it parsed visually rather than logically.  No version of Aeon Flux could be honestly considered any kind of classic and I really can't privilege either of the previous versions over this one.Once one gets past the fact that this doesn't have the tightest plot in the history of cinema and just concentrates on the visuals that was really all the previous two versions had going for it, this is actually a fairly pleasant film.  Yeah, there were moments when I would flinch at the silliness of things, but, again, the same silliness afflicted the novel and animated series.If there is a chameleon in the movies today, it is Charlize Theron.  I find it nothing should of stunning the various physical types that she can play and I think she did a more than creditable job in this one.  Her presence here is remarkable of only because she truly is a first rate actress, capable of a wide variety of roles.  She can do action films, dramas, Sci-fi, and comedy, and could probably do other kinds of films as well if called upon to do so.  She looks good as Aeon, nothing like the previous two versions, but then Aeon in those incarnations looked, in my opinion, rather ridiculous.  Since no actresses who are 6'2 and have measurements of 32-16-30 were available, one has to settle for someone like the lovely Ms. Theron.  The greatest testament to her abilities comes from the fact that in the same period of time this film came out, NORTH COUNTRY was released for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and she appeared in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT in an extraordinary role for which she could very well be nominated and win an Emmy (you heard it here first) as the ""special"" British female Rita.  As many will know, Theron, who is a very good athlete, did as many of her stunts as possible.I thought the basic story, as long as one doesn't try to poke too many holes in the plot (an easy thing to do), was fun.  I put no spoiler warnings here so I won't go into the plot, but the basic premise has a kind of Philip K. Dick quality twist on things, where reality isn't as real as it seems.  Nonetheless it is impossible to completely ignore the essential silliness of so many things in the novel/series/movie.  The superfluous athleticism is only one of these.  Why the endless back flips, not only when they are nonfunctional but when they would be actual distractions?  For instance, when Aeon jumps to grab one of the things dangling from the ship that hovers the city she does a full somersault on her way down.  How in the world could that help things?  And why do fifty feet of somersaults instead of simply sprinting?  A one legged person could out hop someone doing back flips or somersaulting.  You can contrast this with the action sequences in another fairly recent film, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.  What makes Matt Damon's action sequences so refreshing is that in every instance he does the absolute minimum number of moves to be effective.  It makes Bourne come across as the effective killing machine that he is supposed to be.  Here, as in the novel and series, Aeon comes across as an extravagant wind up toy.  And one of my pet peeves:  breaking necks.  I took quite a bit of martial arts and in grappling classes actually was trained in the ways that one can break a neck, mainly so that you can be on the defensive of it happening to you.  On a host of shows and in movies there has developed an intensely dumb way of doing this, which apparently consists of pushing the chin off to one side.  Trust me, you can't break a neck this way.  (My beloved series BUFFY and ANGEL were two of the worse at perpetuating this method of neck breaking.)  OK, this is nitpicking, but I state it as an example of the way the film starts falling apart if you pick at it.  But, again, the same was true of the novel and series.  It's not like the silliness suddenly started with the movie.So, I recommend this, especially to fans of Sci-fi, as long as you don't expect a tautly thought out story.  What you get is a host of gorgeous images, a compelling main character portrayed by the lovely Charlize Theron, and a pretty interesting visual representation of the future.  I've seen worse and I've definitely seen better but I think a tolerant fan will find more than a little to enjoy in it.",3,Not nearly as bad as I had been led to expect,1145145600,"04 16,

It is not as if it did not have TONS going for it. It can draw from a pretty rich story line of existing comics and animations and has an excellent cast.I was a fan of the Aeon Flux animations back when they were on MTV. So, with memories of those running through my mind I purchsed the DVD before ever having seen the movie.When it was over, I just was not left impressed. It felt like a combination of things that left me so... well... unimpressed by the whole thing. For one, the pace of the movie felt very off. The editing can probably be blamed for much of what is wrong with this film. I am a big fan of Ms. Theron, but she played her character very distant - and she did not seem to be able to do this and keep you attentive. Just being the hottest female butt kicker in town is not enough.The film is set in a far future where there are only a handful of us left in a walled ""utopian"" city. I suspect you won't be more than halfway through the film before you figure out ""The Big Secret"", but I don't have a particular problem with that. It's nice to have clues laid around for us to figure out.It's not going to go down in the books as a defining moment in the science fiction movie making industry.

They're related, inexorably; you draw your own, deeply personal parallels and comparisons.  Me, I think it's irrelevant.Second, I liked the supporting character casting.  How great to see Frances McDormand outside of a Coen Brothers movie, with that wicked red hair--very cool.  Really enjoyed seeing Pete Postlethwaite in this, despite the old-guy make-up and prosthetics.  It's always so great to hear his voice, and look into those deep, sincere eyes, set inside that contradictory mug.  And Johhny Lee Miller.  It took me the ending credits to finally tag him as ""Trainspotting's"" Sick Boy, and I enjoyed him in this work.And that's the extent of my enjoyment.  My only comment upon this film's conclusion was that I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.The Theron costuming was ridiculous, strikingly unsexy and contradictory to the story.  She's attacking one of the most closely guarded facilities in the city, at night, and she's wearing an all-white bodysuit.  The hair is distracting, looking like a despondent Alfalfa most of the time.Overall, the F/X weren't inspiring or impressive, not at all.  I mean, seriously, the jungle landscape at the end looks like that super-cheezy Montezuma pyramid backdrop painting at the end of ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn.""  The chicky fights look exactly like what they are: gymnastics-on-wire, all spinning and floating.She's the best agent ever, yet she's constantly in need of everyone's help to get her out of jams and to help her complete her mission.  Everyone fears her, but it seems she can't get anything done.She's the greatest agent ever, yet her baby sister knows all about her activities as a rebel.  How's that for solid operational security?The Council has surveillance everywhere--everywhere!--and yet Aeon and her partner infiltrate the inner sanctum without any real problem, just more sexy wire-gymnastics.  And not one alarm goes off; no guards are alerted.  Seems they don't even have cameras to monitor these incredibly sensitive areas.At the end, Aeon, Trevor, and evil brother Oren all get shot, but the dozens and dozens and dozens of evil guards/troopers never land a shot on any one of them. All three main characters go down, heavily wounded, until the script tells them to get up, run, and do something conclusive. The evil guards manage to kill all three Monican snipers, hundreds of feet away, but when it comes time to shoot down either Trevor or Aeon, they're predictably incapable; it's just sad, stock, laughable Hollywood pan-n-slow-mo of Aeon in her cool outfit with the casings spinning, mowing them down as they stand pretty for her.And Aeon destroys the Relicle.  How is it that in 400+ years, no one, no rebel had ever boarded it before?  Seemed to be relatively easy, again with no security, no monitoring whatsoever.  How is it they'd never shot it down, since weapons and training don't seem to be a problem for the rebels?  How is it no one else knows what its functions are?  What absolutely stark raving idiot of a government chief executive chose to store the collected DNA repository of all living human beings in a Goodyear blimp with gold taffeta trendrils flying in circles over the city?  How is this a common-sensical security decision? I think an underground vault would be a smarter move.And Aeon somehow has freed everyone because she's killed the DNA library and now everyone has to really die?  Like just destroying the Relicle puts it all to rest?  Hello, the DNA is standing around you in the city streets gawking at the spectacle, and the scientific knowledge to continue the cloning program is common.  Yes, there's that long sought after regime change, but the only change in the dynamic is enlightened leadership allowing natural procreation, the path out of the dark and into a new dawn for humanity.And the big wall gets all smashed down and there's that wild jungle outside.  Gosh, I didn't get that symbolism at all.  Say, why don't you just glue that symbol to a two-by-four and hit me over the head with it, so I'll really REALLY get the point.Bottom line:  This is not the cartoon--which was better in every way--and one shouldn't expect it to be.

I haven't seen it, aside from a few clips, but I'm pretty sure that Tank Girl is a a good example of what can happen.The acting is very acceptable for the genre. The action sequences are spectacular, but are too numerous and simply act as a crutch for the drama. The sets including Berlin locations are excellent. And the plot is actually very good if its more philosophical aspects could have been brought more the fore to dramatically support a story that is a development of  a myriad of snippets from the animations to at least make a story from, remain reasonably suggestive of the animations, for those who have seen the animations, but which have no such storyline, as such.If failings have to be attributed, it is simply that no clear decision was made about who is the audience for this film. Simply hung on the action, as were the animations for the most part, would have been relentlessly tedious at this length of a film. And to approach it from a dramatic development of the plot, would have demanded a degree of dramatisation well beyond the maker's commitment and/or capability.

But of course there's more to the story.  She discovers a hidden truth:The plague that destroyed most of humanity way back in 2011 had left the survivors sterile, and what people had thought were newborn babies were in fact implanted clone embryos.Society had become a sterile museum piece, with no fertile offspring, no new ideas or growth was possible and the world had become a meaningless, perfect but unchanging island of technology.On the other hand, death has been banished - as clones take the place of children, individuals had for centuries been succeeded by their carbon copies.  So while individuals had aged and passed, their DNA blueprints had endured.And so the question:  Is life so precious that it should be preserved if technology makes it possible is invented?  The answer: No.That position - that Cloning is Good - is taken by the villains. The moral: Death is necessary..  As carbon copies we lose our individuality and our sacred concept of pure free will is degraded as our abilities and attributes become tracable and assigned to our DNA instead of our personal decisions.And thus humanity in the current definition ends, and we become simple cogs in a soul-less machine/society. Eaon sees this, as she describes the citizenry as 'walking ghosts'.Like Venice, embalmed in the 1850's into a museum-area for tourists, so too would the Eaon Flux Future be a bleak and meaningless existence. Inflexible, narrow, devoid of uncertainty and the pleasure or pain of a dynamic possibilities.So .. Eaon figures out who the good guys are.  She Arranges through a long and overly complex plot to kill the bad guys, thereby freeing the future from it's well-intentioned but wrong-headed techno-overlords, and lives happily ever after in a fertile world - until her certain death in the distant future, which is exactly as it should be.In the end the city wall is broken and a reborn humanity is again free to flood outward into a rejuvinated natural world, a new Garden of Eden with a limitless future.Hooray!..Charlize Theron looks like a stunningly perfect ballerina sculpture from every angle, absolutely hypnotizing, like a poised Leni-Reifenstahl Uber-Athlete made of porcelain. At 29, I'm glad she made this movie. The world wants to see her beauty, and as gravity catches up with her it's likely she'll never look this good again.But sadly..there wasn't enough personality in this film - the sterility was deeper than the surface.  Every single sentence felt like a movement of a chess piece on an inorganic 3D backboard which really needed more verve and charm. The total abstraction of 'society', while necessary to the story, felt shallow.If we're meant to root for humanity - we needed to see it.  I didn't see anything on the screen worth saving - instead we were supposed to be rooting for a deeper, more complex humanity which the filmakers didn't decide to show us, probably due to time-constraints and lack of imagination.  They've built themselves a magnificent edifice, but there wasn't any jelly in this donut.  Just cement sculpture and beautiful acrobatics.Good movies that make somewhat similar points about our DNA-enhanced/cloned dystopic future, but with different styles and emphasises.. are George Lucas's THX-1138 (1970), Gattaca(1997), Equilibrium(2000), Code 46(2003) and The Island (2005).The other direction for modern Sci-Fi is Man-vs-Robot, or computer intelligence. Some movies in that genre are I-Robot (2004), A.I. Artificial Intelligience (1999), the Matrix movies, and the sublime Bladerunner(1982).And then there's man vs. Alien, but that's a whole other story, And from there there's Man vs. the One Ring & the Orc Army, or Potter vs. Golden Snitch.  Fantasy has a place.Sci-Fi represents a deep vein of Metaphysical BS which Hollywood should continue to mine - I wait with baited breath.",3,"Interesting Philosoph Movie - Beautiful, Shallow, Charming.",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,4079,"['-Spoiler', 'Alert-The', 'premise', 'movie', 'Eaon', 'secret', ""'terrorist'/freedom"", 'fighter/assasin', 'eliminate', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'corrupt', 'leader', 'future', 'Utopia/Dystopia', 'post-apocalypse', 'world', '400', 'years', 'future', 'course', 'more', 'story', 'hidden', 'truth', 'plague', 'destroyed', 'most', 'humanity', 'way', 'back', '2011', 'had', 'left', 'survivors', 'sterile', 'what', 'people', 'had', 'thought', 'were', 'newborn', 'babies', 'were', 'fact', 'implanted', 'clone', 'embryos.Society', 'had', 'become', 'sterile', 'museum', 'piece', 'fertile', 'offspring', 'new', 'ideas', 'growth', 'was', 'possible', 'world', 'had', 'become', 'meaningless', 'perfect', 'unchanging', 'island', 'technology.On', 'other', 'hand', 'death', 'been', 'banished', 'clones', 'take', 'place', 'children', 'individuals', 'had', 'centuries', 'been', 'succeeded', 'carbon', 'copies', 'So', 'individuals', 'had', 'aged', 'passed', 'DNA', 'blueprints', 'had', 'endured.And', 'so', 'question', 'life', 'so', 'precious', 'should', 'be', 'preserved', 'technology', 'possible', 'invented', 'answer', 'position', 'Cloning', 'Good', 'taken', 'villains', 'moral', 'Death', 'necessary..', 'carbon', 'copies', 'lose', 'individuality', 'sacred', 'concept', 'pure', 'free', 'will', 'degraded', 'abilities', 'become', 'tracable', 'assigned', 'DNA', 'instead', 'personal', 'decisions.And', 'thus', 'humanity', 'current', 'definition', 'ends', 'become', 'simple', 'cogs', 'soul-less', 'machine/society', 'Eaon', 'citizenry', ""'walking"", ""ghosts'.Like"", 'Venice', 'embalmed', '1850', 'museum-area', 'tourists', 'so', 'too', 'would', 'Eaon', 'Flux', 'Future', 'be', 'bleak', 'meaningless', 'existence', 'Inflexible', 'narrow', 'devoid', 'uncertainty', 'pleasure', 'pain', 'dynamic', 'possibilities.So', '..', 'Eaon', 'out', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'long', 'overly', 'complex', 'plot', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'thereby', 'freeing', 'future', 'well-intentioned', 'wrong-headed', 'techno-overlords', 'happily', 'ever', 'fertile', 'world', 'certain', 'death', 'distant', 'future', 'exactly', 'should', 'be.In', 'end', 'city', 'wall', 'broken', 'reborn', 'humanity', 'again', 'free', 'flood', 'outward', 'rejuvinated', 'natural', 'world', 'new', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'limitless', 'future.Hooray', '..Charlize', 'Theron', 'stunningly', 'perfect', 'ballerina', 'sculpture', 'angle', 'absolutely', 'hypnotizing', 'poised', 'Leni-Reifenstahl', 'Uber-Athlete', 'made', 'porcelain', '29', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'movie', 'world', 'see', 'beauty', 'gravity', 'up', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'good', 'again.But', 'sadly..there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'personality', 'film', 'sterility', 'was', 'deeper', 'surface', 'single', 'sentence', 'felt', 'movement', 'chess', 'piece', 'inorganic', '3D', 'backboard', 'really', 'needed', 'more', 'verve', 'charm', 'total', 'abstraction', ""'society"", 'necessary', 'story', 'felt', 'shallow.If', ""'re"", 'meant', 'root', 'humanity', 'needed', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'screen', 'worth', 'saving', 'instead', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'humanity', 'filmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'show', 'probably', 'due', 'time-constraints', 'lack', 'imagination', ""'ve"", 'built', 'magnificent', 'edifice', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'jelly', 'donut', 'Just', 'cement', 'sculpture', 'beautiful', 'acrobatics.Good', 'movies', 'make', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'points', 'DNA-enhanced/cloned', 'dystopic', 'future', 'different', 'styles', 'emphasises..', 'are', 'George', 'Lucas', 'THX-1138', '1970', 'Gattaca', '1997', 'Equilibrium', '2000', 'Code', '46', '2003', 'Island', '2005', '.The', 'other', 'direction', 'modern', 'Sci-Fi', 'Man-vs-Robot', 'computer', 'intelligence', 'movies', 'genre', 'are', 'I-Robot', '2004', 'A.I', 'Artificial', 'Intelligience', '1999', 'Matrix', 'movies', 'sublime', 'Bladerunner', '1982', '.And', 'then', 'man', 'vs.', 'Alien', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'Man', 'One', 'Ring', 'Orc', 'Army', 'Potter', 'Golden', 'Snitch', 'Fantasy', 'place.Sci-Fi', 'deep', 'vein', 'Metaphysical', 'BS', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'continue', 'mine', 'wait', 'baited', 'breath']",N/A

170557,A3M2WW0PO34B94,1415720584,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 6]","Never has so much work been put into a film that means so little.Aeon (Charlize Theron) is an elite member of a group called the Monicans. Due to a large-scale epidemic, there is only one city left on the planet ruled by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who heads a council of elders (of sorts), including his brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller). Everyone in the cast seems to have been chosen because they spell their names in an odd way. Perhaps this is the director's subconscious method of evoking the future. The Monicans realize that although everything may look good, they are living in a police state and nefarious people lurk in the background, extracting citizens without cause. Aeon receives her latest instructions from Handler (Frances McDormand): The Monicans want her to assassinate Goodchild. Aeon has good reason to hate the Chairman as her sister was just murdered, for being a suspected member of the Monicans. The Monicans have received secret information that he will be vulnerable at a certain time. Just as she is about to kill him, Goodchild recognizes Aeon and asks ""Catherine?"" causing her to lose her concentration.""Aeon Flux"", directed by Karyn Kusama, whose only other film was the independent film ""Girlfight"", is an interesting film to look at, to a point, but it is extremely simplistic and hollow.The film is based on a series of graphic novels and an animated series, which I am not familiar with. A friend told me that in these original incarnations, Aeon is repeatedly killed and then cloned, to keep coming back and back. If this is true, it seems rather pointless. How can we root for Aeon, the hero, if she is so completely unsuccessful that she repeatedly gets killed? Thankfully, the filmmakers have changed this when adapting for the big screen. Charlize Theron's interpretation of the character is an extremely well-trained assassin who seems to have every skill she needs at her fingertips. This makes her the sort of tough, no nonsense woman you are probably expecting from the commercials and trailers.But she is ultimately too tough. Aeon never shows any emotion. Even when her sister is killed, a tear barely falls before she is off running, kicking, or killing guards with a quick jerk on their necks. Note to filmmakers: They don't all have to be cold-hearted and stone-faced killers in the future. This would be an acceptable trait for the lead character if anyone else showed any emotion. Occasionally, a tear makes its way down a cheek, but the person remains cold and immobile. But no one does. I understand all of this stoicism is meant to evoke the sterile, antiseptic feel of the future, but we're beyond that. We can see a character show some emotion in the future.Watching Charlize Theron kick box her way through a series of attackers is fun, but it gets repetitive. Real fast. She gets a scratch here and a cut there, but nothing seems to slow her down. She just keeps running or kicking or hitting, etc. Yawn. When there is little or no evidence that she will ever be waylaid by any injury, any suspense generated by the situation quickly evaporates. Many of these futuristic fighting machines are just that, machines. They never appear vulnerable, never show emotion and simply move from one target to the next, trying to achieve some goal. What the filmmakers are missing is that the character, their futuristic fighting machine, needs to have something for us, the audience to identify with. Give the machine some trait or other that lets us in, shows us they are vulnerable. This is one of the reasons The Terminator is such a great character. In ""The Terminator"", he is originally the villain. Yet, he is also vulnerable, he can be slowed down. In the sequel, he becomes the protector and even though he isn't the most emotive guy in the world, we see that he cares about Sarah and John Connor. This made him a character we could identify with, yes, even though he is a robot who kills, leaving a path of destruction.The design of ""Aeon Flux"" is interesting and easily the best thing about the film. It occurred to me that director Kusama probably grew up watching films like ""Logan's Run"" and similar mid-70s attempts at depicting the future, and really enjoyed them. This is her homage to these films. The film looks and feels like ""Run"", but made with better special effects. Buildings have sleek shapes, built in concrete. Clothes are strange, made primarily of leather and latex and cover odd parts of the body. Food is interesting. It looks as though they took a mixture of the oddest looking things they could find in real life and interspersed them throughout, adding a touch of interest to a strange bleak landscape. At one point, Aeon's sister is cutting into a star fruit, which is supposed to be a futuristic thing, but exists in this day and age. I have heard that much of the film was shot in Germany, presumably to use some of their slightly surrealistic architecture as the basis for this futuristic world.Is this attempt at creating a new world enough to warrant your time and money? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The film is well-produced, but it is not well-written or directed well. Until the filmmakers can begin to create futuristic characters that experience some believable emotion, which can make us feel for them, don't bother. Without this human touch, these films will always feel like hollow shells of moviemaking excess.",2,Theron Is Too Tough To Be Likable,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,5413,"['Never', 'so', 'much', 'work',

170561,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,1415720584,trebe,"[6, 7]","Aeon Flux (2005) is a slick science fiction adventure, with Aeon being a sleek, attractive, and athletic heroine.  The character is taken from an animated MTV short, created by Peter Chung.  Substantial changes were made in order to develop a suitable full length story, and to allow for the adaptation of an animated adventure, to a real life format.  The story is complicated, but holds together pretty well, and features various futuristic sets, numerous action sequences, and impressive special effects.In order to survive a deadly plague, drastic measures were required, and the last remnants of humanity live in a city with walls along its perimeter, called Bregna.  Life seems ideal, but a small organization, known as the Monicans seeks to destroy the government structure.  Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), is an elite guerilla operative for the Monicans, who receives instructions telepathically, from the Handler (Frances McDormand).  Her next mission is huge, to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas).  Tragically, before she is about to embark, Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner) is shot, apparently for being suspected as a Monican.Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller), is also a member of the Government, believing his brother Trevor is not with the program, he hatches a scheme to eliminate his older sibling using the Monicans.  With the help of Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) another elite operative, Aeon enters the Cidadel, the seat of the government, and gets into position to complete her mission, but when face to face with Goodchild, Aeon hesitates, and is captured.  Things take a dramatic turn when Aeon learns the truth about Trevor, and the work he has been involved in.  The two team up to try and survive the Bregnan government, and the Monicans, who regard Aeon as a traitor.The film shifts into a high action mode in the final stretch.  There are some shaky, over the edge moments, but the result are exciting, stylized, and dramatic.  Whether the resolution is palatable, is another matter, as Aeon makes a decision that all humanity must live with.After Charlize Theron won an Oscar for Monster (2003), by her own admission, she did no major physical training, and needed to get in top shape for her physical demanding role as Aeon Flux.  Theron and Sophie Okonedo, both tall and athletic, underwent similar training regimes, eventually training together.  Remarkably, Theron did almost all of her own stunts, and amazed the production crew with her physical ability and timing.  Her acrobatic performance, in a skin tight suit, is quite impressive, as is that of Okonedo whose character has hands for feet.The  future world of Aeon Flux is intriguing, and semi-understandable, but with many mysterious elements.  There are theatrical show pieces like the cathedral where the Handler gives directions, a and blimp that flies over the city, and interdimensional transitions, that are really not explained.  The unique architecture of Berlin was featured, and helps give the film an certain ambiance and futuristic look.  Director Karyn Kusama (Jennifer's Body), whose only previous experience was Girlfight (2000), does a quite remarkable job in a challenging project.  The screenplay by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, apparently covered much more ground, and may have filled in some of the gaps.  Some 30 minutes was reportedly deleted from the director's cut, for the theatrical release.  Some may feel that the liberties taken with the character, had already gone too far.  Creator Peter Chung, apparently had some problems with the film.The blu-ray disc does not contain the director's cut, but appears to contain the same 92 minute version of the film, as well as the extras from the Special Collector's Edition.  This includes two separate commentary tracks, and a number of informative featurettes.  Graeme Revell contributes a cool score for the film.  Although perhaps an incomplete vision, for some thoughtful science fiction, with some stylized action, Aeon Flux is worth a look.  Based on her performance here, Charlize Theron has great potential in the action genre, and hopefully she will pursue this avenue at some future time.",4,"intrigue in a futuristic world, to break a 400 year long cycle . . .",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,4195,"['Aeon', 'Flux', '2005', 'slick', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'Aeon', 'being', 'sleek', 'attractive', 'athletic', 'heroine', 'character', 'taken', 'animated', 'MTV', 'short', 'created', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'Substantial', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'order', 'develop', 'suitable', 'full', 'length', 'story', 'allow', 'adaptation', 'animated', 'adventure', 'real', 'life', 'format', 'story', 'complicated', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'various', 'futuristic', 'sets', 'numerous', 'action', 'sequences', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects.In', 'order', 'survive', 'deadly', 'plague', 'drastic', 'measures', 'were', 'required', 'last', 'remnants', 'humanity', 'live', 'city', 'walls', 'perimeter', 'called', 'Bregna', 'Life', 'ideal', 'small', 'organization', 'known', 'Monicans', 'destroy', 'government', 'structure', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'elite', 'guerilla', 'operative', 'Monicans', 'who', 'instructions', 'telepathically', 'Handler', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'next', 'mission', 'huge', 'assassinate', 'head', 'government', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'Tragically', 'about', 'embark', 'Aeon', 'sister', 'Una', 'Amelia', 'Warner', 'shot', 'apparently', 'being', 'suspected', 'Monican.Oren', 'Goodchild', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'also', 'member', 'Government', 'believing', 'brother', 'Trevor', 'not', 'program', 'scheme', 'eliminate', 'older', 'sibling', 'using', 'Monicans', 'help', 'Sithandra', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'elite', 'operative', 'Aeon', 'Cidadel', 'seat', 'government', 'position', 'complete', 'mission', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'Goodchild', 'Aeon', 'captured', 'Things', 'take', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'when', 'Aeon', 'truth', 'Trevor', 'work', 'been', 'involved', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'try', 'survive', 'Bregnan', 'government', 'Monicans', 'who', 'regard', 'Aeon', 'traitor.The', 'film', 'shifts', 'high', 'action', 'mode', 'final', 'stretch', 'are', 'shaky', 'edge', 'moments', 'result', 'are', 'exciting', 'stylized', 'dramatic', 'resolution', 'palatable', 'matter', 'Aeon', 'decision', 'humanity', 'must', 'live', 'with.After', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Monster', '2003', 'own', 'admission', 'did', 'major', 'physical', 'training', 'needed', 'get', 'top', 'shape', 'physical', 'demanding', 'role', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Theron', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'tall', 'athletic', 'underwent', 'similar', 'training', 'regimes', 'eventually', 'training', 'together', 'Remarkably', 'Theron', 'did', 'almost', 'own', 'stunts', 'amazed', 'production', 'crew', 'physical', 'ability', 'timing', 'acrobatic', 'performance', 'skin', 'tight', 'suit', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Okonedo', 'character', 'hands', 'feet.The', 'future', 'world', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'intriguing', 'semi-understandable', 'many', 'mysterious', 'elements', 'are', 'theatrical', 'show', 'pieces', 'cathedral', 'where', 'Handler', 'directions', 'blimp', 'city', 'interdimensional', 'transitions', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'explained', 'unique', 'architecture', 'Berlin', 'was', 'featured', 'give', 'film', 'certain', 'ambiance', 'futuristic', 'look', 'Director', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'only', 'previous', 'experience', 'was', 'Girlfight', '2000', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'job', 'challenging', 'project', 'screenplay', 'Matt', 'Manfredi', 'Phil', 'Hay', 'apparently', 'covered', 'much', 'more', 'ground', 'may', 'have', 'filled', 'gaps', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'reportedly', 'deleted', 'director', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'release', 'may', 'feel', 'liberties', 'taken', 'character', 'had', 'already', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'Creator', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'apparently', 'had', 'problems', 'film.The', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'not', 'contain', 'director', 'cut', 'contain', 'same', '92', 'minute', 'version', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'two', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'number', 'informative', 'featurettes', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'cool', 'score', 'film', 'perhaps', 'incomplete', 'vision', 'thoughtful', 'science', 'fiction', 'stylized', 'action', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'look', 'Based', 'performance', 'here', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'great', 'potential', 'action', 'genre', 'hopefully', 'will', 'pursue', 'avenue', 'future', 'time']",N/A

The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin.But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up.But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.'Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.",2,Charlize Theron is a Sci-fi World Ninja in MTV Style: Loses Steam As It Goes,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,2209,"['know', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'been', 'either', 'ignored', 'dismissed', 'nonsense', 'critics', 'results', 'US', 'box-office', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'So', 'here', 'question', 'so', 'bad', 'bad', 'how', 'bad', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'thought', 'critics', 'were', 'wrong', 'earlier', 'chapters', 'heroine', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'ninja-like', 'deadly', 'assassin', 'are', 'full', 'rip-roaring', 'sequences', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'ideas', 'such', 'deadly', 'turf', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'MTV', 'series', 'thought', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'black', 'costumes', 'not', 'hairstyle', 'life', 'thin', 'story', 'origin.But', 'sadly', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'loses', 'steam', 'too', 'soon', 'target', 'Trevor', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'leader', 'futuristic', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'secrets', 'surrounding', 'Trevor', 'Aeon', 'film', 'little', 'tell', 'little', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'also', 'Aeon', 'sister', 'Una', 'Amelia', 'Warner', 'Aeon', 'partner', 'Sithandra', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'characters', 'have', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'story', 'Even', 'two', 'veterans', 'such', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'are', 'buries', 'CGI-created', 'halo', 'heavy', 'make-up.But', 'only', 'are', 'healthy', 'amount', 'good', 'actions', 'flaw', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Sorry', 'Karyn', 'Kusama', 'who', 'directed', 'acclaimed', 'Girlfight', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'choice', 'keep', 'film', 'good', 'pace', 'second', 'half', 'slackening', 'dull', 'uninspired', 'actions', 'concluding', 'part', 'very', 'disappointing', 'nothing', 'have', 'seen', 'sci-fi', 'better', 'actions', 'Equilibrium', 'checked', 'out', 'informative', 'site', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'found', 'as', 'many', 'four', 'critics', 'cited', 'name', 'Catwoman', 'order', 'mercilessly', 'ridicule', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'unkind', 'comparison', 'understandable', 'two', 'films', 'contain', 'talented', 'safe', 'say', 'beautiful', 'Oscar-winners', 'have', 'one', 'strong', 'woman', 'central', 'role', 'define', 'meaning', 'stylish', 'action', 'quite', 'unique', 'way', 'Add', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'like', 'what', 'can', 'have', 'Three', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'three', 'very', 'good-looking', 'posters']",N/A

I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.",3,Top-notch Actresses Playing Sci-fi Action Chicks.,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2805,"['was', 'drawn', 'seeing', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'trailer', 'provided', 'few', 'impressive', 'action', 'scenes', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'participations', 'three', 'Oscar-nominated/winning', 'actresses', 'teaming', 'up', 'Sci-fi', 'action', 'chick', 'flick', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'way', 'back', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'days', 'loved', 'work', 'Monster', 'recent', 'North', 'Country', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'see', 'can', 'play', 'action', 'hero', 'considered', 'got', 'supermodel', 'body', 'great', 'actress', 'how', 'often', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'submitts', 'big', 'budget', 'commercial', 'film', 'not', 'dismiss', 'appeal', 'last', 'year', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'also', 'strong', 'supporting', 'role', 'managed', 'steal', 'scenes', 'Theron.Aeon', 'Flux', 'place', '400', 'years', 'future', 'when', 'virus', 'afflicted', 'Earth', 'had', 'eliminated', '99', '%', 'human', 'population', 'remaining', 'one', 'million', 'reside', 'city', 'Bregna', 'controlled', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'citizens', 'are', 'duplicated', 'clones', 'original', 'DNAs', 'are', 'unaware', 'are', 'merely', 'living', 'ghost', 'Resistant', 'group', 'called', 'Monicants', 'are', 'lead', 'Handler', 'God-like', 'character', 'played', 'McDormand', 'have', 'mission', 'kill', 'Goodchild', 'take', 'over', 'regime', 'highly', 'trained', 'skillful', 'Monicant', 'named', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Theron', 'sidekick', 'Sithandra', 'Okonedo', 'are', 'sent', 'assassin', 'Goodchild', 'mission', 'are', 'many', 'dangerous', 'horizons', 'have', 'encounter', 'getting', 'highly', 'secured', 'buildings', 'where', 'Goodchild', 'team', 'were', 'hiding', 'seemingly', 'fearless', 'emotionless', 'Flux', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'clone', 'true', 'identity', 'becomes', 'clear', 'when', 'forgotten', 'past-life', 'husband', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'now', 'torn', 'unsolving', 'mystery', 'clone', 'humans', 'abandoning', 'mission', 'same', 'time', 'Oren', 'Goodchild', 'Johnny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'rebelling', 'Trevor', 'let', 'Trevor', 'use', 'new-found', 'cure', 'disease', 'would', 'end', 'cloning', 'humans', 'Trevor', 'Aeon', 'have', 'became', 'fugitives', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'defeat', 'Oren', 'assassins', 'sent', 'Handler', '.This', 'film', 'great', 'production', 'designs', 'futuristic', 'costumes', 'are', 'quite', 'meticulous', 'impressive', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'worthwhile', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'who', 'played', 'clone', 'Keeper', 'had', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'roles', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'low-key', 'unchallenging', 'Theron', 'black', 'spandex', 'bodysuit', 'most', 'time', 'even', 'had', 'wear', 'flesh', 'revealing', 'beaded', 'underwear', 'one', 'scene', 'also', 'had', 'steamy', 'romantic', 'moments', 'hunky', 'Marton', 'Csokas']",N/A

This one is as fast and as furious as any other around. And it's better looking than most, and it makes better use of the female leads.There's some kind of a plot to this movie, if you pay attention to such things: some far future place, the last enclave of mankind. A terrible plague nearly wiped out humanity, and an equally terrible cure nearly finished the job by sterilizing the survivors. Society sustains itself by recycling DNA - cloning people, and maintaining the population by replacement as the old copies die. There may, however, be a cure for the cure, a way to reverse the sterility and restart the genetic Mixmaster. A power struggle ensues, with the tyrants who like being themselves again and again trying to quash the discovery.Enter Aeon, codename for the super-assassin-babe (Charlize Theron). She'll take out an armed and armored platoon bare handed and never muss a single spike of her sabertooth bangs. That's about it, really, lots of running around and go-boom, with pretty women. Pretty women with their clothes on, if it matters to you. One thing that sets it apart from others in its class, like The 'Matrix', is the pace of action. Where 'The Matrix' alternated set-piece action sequences and breathing space, this one sustains the energy level better. Maybe it doesn't peak as high, but it keeps a thundering pace. And, according to the extras, Theron and the other leads did nearly all their own stunts. If there's one thing cooler than a hot babe, it's a hot babe who can do stuff.The locations deserve special mention. They're convincingly futuristic, which makes a pretty disappointing statement about our sense of the future. All those high tech, way cool pieces of architecture actually exist and have mundane use: an animal shelter, an urban water supply, a crematorium, or a wind tunnel dating back half a hundred years. The coolest location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church. What can I say? The future just isn't what it used to be.It has great action, a great look, and great female leads. If you have a fourteen year old boy anywhere in your spirit, let it see this movie.
