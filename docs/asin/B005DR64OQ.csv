I will say that Nicole Kidman looks absoultely stunning in this film!

I don't know what's happened to his acting lately but this guy needs to tone it down, like seriously! He overacts in every scene, this man used to be one of my favorite actors (anyone remember Leaving Las Vegas?), but he just can't seem to control his crazy antics anymore and it's very sad.

1455910,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005DR64OQ,A kids review,"[1, 1]","Those who are intent on scrutinizing Nicolas Cage's career as he takes role after role in films of ALL sorts may want to give this one a look, if only for a few more of his trademark freakout moments. Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman, Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining. It's not much of a surprise that the film opened almost exactly two weeks ago and is now already finding its way to home video.",1,Trespass,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,723,"['who', 'are', 'intent', 'scrutinizing', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'career', 'role', 'role', 'films', 'ALL', 'sorts', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'look', 'only', 'few', 'more', 'trademark', 'freakout', 'moments', 'Helmed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'co-starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Trespass', 'wealthy', 'young', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'hostage', 'mansion', 'extortionists', 'looking', 'score', 'home', 'invasion', 'run', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'familiar', 'elements', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'Panic', 'Room', 'rendering', 'tension', 'ineffective', 'far', 'too', 'nasty', 'aggressive', 'be', 'entertaining', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'film', 'opened', 'almost', 'exactly', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'now', 'already', 'finding', 'way', 'home', 'video']",N/A

I used to say a movie I hated was the worst one I've ever seen, only to be surprised by something even worse.  On that premise, the only thing I can safely assure you of is that this is a top contender for biggest stinker of all time if not the ultimate one.Another thing I would like to point out is that I was never interested in seeing this movie because Nicole ""Ice Queen"" Kidman and Nicholas ""Ought to be locked in a"" Cage are known for their ingenious knack of being in stinkers.  Well, combine the two with a cast of inept robbers who act as bad as most of the cast in Malevolence, and you get yourself one toxic waste of a stench that would make you want to clear the room if not for the stop button.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is I didn't choose to watch it.  Unfortunately, Sweetie Pie Dearest realized his blunder in choice less than half-way through, and I made the choice to finish watching it, truly amazed at how bad it was.  How much worse was it going to get?  LOTS!The robbers were stupid, the dumbest one being the guy who had the hots for Nicole. Guess his freezer was broke and he needed something frigid to rest his beer on.  Cage's character was the worst, his character doing the most nonsensical things witnessed on film in a long time.  No matter what this idiot gets threatened with, no matter how much violence and bad language ensue, he refuses to give up any money.  If he'd have given the creeps anything at all right away, we wouldn't have had 90 minutes of bad over-acting and the world's most pointless plot.  No, he won't do it, so we have to watch the worst character of all outdo Cage's awful delivery running around strung out in a purple dress and torturing a young girl.  In fact, the only character with any brains in this movie was the daughter.I'm so angry with myself for choosing to finish this horrible flick that I can't even bear to get into the absurdities of a guy with a gun, a needle, a wife rape, removing a daughter's kidney, and a kook obsessed with the Ice Queen staring him in the face being uncooperative at every turn, so all I can say is if you still think this movie sounds appealing, you are more easily entertained than a little kid watching Teletubbies.

TRESPASS is not a brilliant or unique film, but it is a quality piece of work. It has a script By Karl Gajdusek with some fine lines and quality twists that keep the audience guessing and enough innovative bits of action that make the film seem fresh (even if the behavior of all concerned is not to swift!).Kyle Miller (Nicholas Cage) appears obsessed with his business life - marketing diamonds - and comes home to his mansion (designed by his wife) where wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) seems to be needing more than an income to make her life complete. They share a teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) who is typically making her own decisions about socializing despite her parents objections: she sneaks out of the highly security guarded house to go to a naughty party. In the rush of all this there is a call at the door which when opened shows us four masked bandits who are there to rob the safe. The thugs are a strange assortment: the main speaker is Elias (the talented Ben Mendelsohn), his druggie girlfriend Petal (Jordana Spiro), Eiias' young brother Jonah (the hunky rising star Cam Gigandet), and the heavy Ty (Dash Mihok). The crooks want the safe opened but Kyle refuses, beginning to bargain with the thugs until the truth of his financial situation is made known. Sarah wants Kyle to open the safe, attempting to hide her own secret that involves Jonah.  Avery sneaks back home to find her parents beaten and held as hostages and all the secrets of all the cast are gradually revealed  - secrets that lead to an unexpected resolution.Nicholas Cage is Nicholas Cage, and it works for him.  The real star turns in the film are those by Ben Mendelsohn and Cam Gigandet.  Nicole Kidman provides solid support in her bifurcated role.  The movie is no great shakes, but it is a tense evening's entertainment. One surprise comes in the closing credits: they are rolled with some very soothing and beautiful movie music by David Buckley instead of the usual hardrock noisy song that most of these movies select to bring the film to a close.

1455932,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005DR64OQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[25, 30]","Trespass was doomed from the beginning. Set to play the antagonist, Nicolas Cage walked off the set only to return a few days later to play the protagonist. The studio, showing little faith in the finished product, opted to give the film a limited release in theatres with a release to video-on-demand the same day and, to top it all off, set a home video release date before it even hit theatres and VOD. It doesn't help that the film reunites one of Hollywood's most misunderstood actors with director Joel Schumacher, who still can't escape the wrath of film critics and audiences for directing Batman & Robin. Trespass is another home invasion movie; a sub-genre that has been done very well (Panic Room) and has been done decently (Hostage). It is neither Cage nor Schumacher that is to blame for how this film turned out, but screenwriter Karl Gajdusek, whose only previous credits include episodes of the television show Dead Like Me. The idea and execution is derivative of home invasion movies that came before it and offers nothing new or exciting to the premise. Everything is by-the-numbers, full of clich&eacute;s and idiotic plot twists, resulting in a predictable climax. Even worse, Trespass has stupid criminals and stupid victims making it hard to root for either one. With a brisk 90-minute running time it doesn't waste time jumping into the core of the plot though.Nicolas Cage plays Kyle Miller, a diamond dealer who lives in a lavish isolated mansion with his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) and daughter Avery (Liana Liberato). Soon after Kyle arrives home, Avery has snuck out of the house to attend a party in an attempt to set up the suspense that she'll return when everything goes awry. Only 12 minutes in, the Miller home has been invaded by four criminals. The apparent ringleader (Ben Mendelsohn) wants Kyle to open his safe, which is believed to contain hundreds of thousands worth of diamonds and cash. The criminals plan to be in and out of the house in twenty minutes, but matters grow difficult when Kyle stubbornly refuses to bend to their will. Meanwhile, Sarah notices something familiar about one of the criminals (Cam Gigandet) while the emotionally unstable female of the group simply wanders around the house.Trespass is 90 minutes of ""open the safe,"" ""I refuse"" dialogue and overacting, the latter of which makes the film a bit more tolerable than it should've been. There's not much suspense because you can see it coming a mile away and when the illogical plot twist is thrown in all you can do is roll your eyes. Joel Schumacher has directed his share of great, average, and bad films and even if you look at the ones that linger somewhere between bad and average, he's a competent director that knows how to maintain suspense when necessary. Unfortunately, it never occurred to him or the two Academy Award winning actors leading the cast to demand a rewrite of the script. The set-up and execution is so generic that I can't believe anyone involved took part for anything other than money. Cage has done little to keep secret that he's not opposed to renting himself out if the fee is right. With such poor characterization and stilted dialogue, credit must be given to the actors for not sleepwalking through their roles. Mendelsohn brings to mind a young Gary Oldman, but anyone familiar with Cage's filmography will admit that Trespass may have been a better film if he had played Mendelsohn's role. Kidman brings nothing noteworthy to the role of Sarah, but there's nothing noteworthy about the character. Liberato is playing the typical daughter, who just wants to rebel against her parents and go to a party. The role is thankless, but the actress may actually have some talent that could be put to better use in a better movie.Thankfully Cage is always reliable to make something entertain if all else fails and his performance doesn't disappoint. Cage has a tendency to go so over-the-top in bad movies that it's like he's satirizing the ridiculousness of everything; this tendency is often mistaken for bad acting. If you watch Deadfall or The Wicker Man, it becomes apparent that Cage is totally self-aware of the ridiculousness of what he's doing. Cage overacts in Trespass but handles the material more seriously than usual. His performance is fun to watch as he doesn't play it straight (he's attached a barely noticeable accent and plays Kyle in a very pathetic manner), but it doesn't save the film or add enough to boost it to cult ""so-bad-its-good"" status. Few actors play perpetually on edge as well as Cage does and he makes the film marginally better.Trespass is not offensively bad; it's not a film that anyone will kick themselves over wasting 90 minutes of their life on. It's just a forgettable thriller that is so derivative of other films in the genre you may confuse plot elements of other films with this one. It's not an insult to the intelligence of the people watching it, but an insult to the intelligence of those involved. It's never boring, but it fails to create any plausible suspense and lacks the substance necessary to recommend it. It's not that better home invasion films have come before it; if this were the first, it would remain a mediocre effort.GRADE: C",3,"A Generic, By-the-Numbers Home Invasion Movie",1318809600,"10 17,

There's movies that he fits in perfectly too like Bad Lieutenant, Gone in 60seconds, etc. and then there's movies that our buddy Nick just doesn't belong in. The Wicker Man, National Treasure, THIS MOVIE! This movie is a terrible waste of Cage. I kept cringing at every seen just hoping they would shoot him and put him out the misery of being in this film. I mean I already saw a film like this called Hostage a long time ago and that was a waste of Bruce Willis. These rich people getting robbed movies sure have gotten old. Well at least in this movie the guy is actually broke (Post Bush era I guess). I enjoyed that particular twist in the film but that was about all that was interesting. I just kept watching the film hoping that Nicholas would put on his Cage powers and make the movie become worth watching but to no luck the movie just sort of runs on with him just getting beat up like a rag doll and then it just ends? I don't get the ending. Did they run out of film budget? Did they not think of a way to do a 5months later theme showing him and his family happy and smiling together? No, it just turns to black and role credits. Ultimately that also made me feel like I wasted my time if the directors were too lazy to even finish off their bad movie properly. It's like they realized no one was going to make it to the end of the film so they just cut it off. I get the feeling that this film is really some rich Hollywood director/writers attempt at some political message that only the 1% get. As for the rest of us 99% this was just an all out bad film. I knew it was going to be bad as soon as I saw Nichole Kidman in it. Batman,The Others,That movie with her and Tom Cruise I forgot the name of. She seems to have the luck of being in movie that suck.

Miller.It is a film with alot of promise,as Cage is quite convincing in his role,as is Kidman,but as the film rolls on it becomes just another average watch,typical of its type.The story finds Cage as a diamond buyer/seller.As he rolls home to see his wife and daughter whom he hasn't seen in a few days,he is on the phone to a potential client for whom he must dash out later to clinch a deal.After a fairly brief stay he is going out when the ""police"" show up at his gate wanting to see them about burglaries in the area.When they open the door three men and a woman burst in and the game is on;they're there to steal his stash of diamonds and/or cash.As the heist progresses we learn that one of the burglars has more than a passing interest in his wife and in fact was in the house posing as an electrician of sorts and casing the joint.While they think they know Cage's m.o.,it eventually comes out that Cage is in fact broke.He lost his permanent job and has been just eking by with little sales now and again which barely keeps their heads above water.After much torture and threats Cage finally opens the safe to them and nothing is in there.By this time the group are starting to get antsy and time is running out,as it seems one of them owes their boss almost $200,000 from drugs that were stolen off of him.The end of the film comes down to a confrontation in the still under construction part of their new house.A well placed scuffle later and a hidden wall is opened which reveals a huge amount of cash Cage hid,so if the bank repossessed the house they would have at least something.But now one of the men is going to shoot Kidman and the other shoots him dead.A fire breaks out and the last man is burned to death.Kidman holds onto Cage for dear life who has two gun shots in him.Fade to black.The cast is certainly a good one and as I mentioned Cage and Kidman both did good jobs in their respective roles,but it just wasn't good enough to offset that been-there,done-that feeling.There just was nothing distinctive enough and/or atypical to elevate this flick above any others of its genre.Technically speaking the film is crisp and clear in its 2:35:1 w/s a/r.Extras include three featurettes and a cast a crew interview.All in all a disappointing effort from Schumacher,from whom I would expect more.His end product is just an average flick for its kind and it fails

While trying to buy time Kyle begins to question the robbers and secrets are revealed and the break-in becomes more tense. This is a movie that had a lot of potential to be great and exciting. The big problem with this one is that it was a good half hour story that is drug out for 90 minutes. It is a good movie that is worth a watch, but it seems to get a tad repetitive and because of that it loses some of the edge that it needs to get the effect it needs. For those that know me know that I am not a Nicholas Cage fan at all and I am also in love with Nicole Kidman, so this was a very personal movie for me. I will admit that Cage didn't bother me in this as much as he usually does. From me that's a huge compliment. Overall, definitely worth watching, but like most movies lately this was missing something to make it really great.

1455960,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005DR64OQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Trespass"" is a home invasion thriller that is not so much terrible as mediocre. Director Joel Schumacher (""Falling Down"" ""Time to Kill"") keeps the ball rolling, and there are some nice twists and turns along the way, but before the film reaches its halfway point, I think most of the viewers would lose interest in what is going on. In other words, we just don't care when we don't know what these characters really want to do, whose motives remain unconvincing throughout. In short, everything in ""Trespass"" looks very silly.A diamond dealer Kyle Miller (Nicolas Cage) and his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) living in a lavish lakeside house are taken hostage by a group of robbers. The masked criminals think this is an easy job until Kyle refuses to open the safe, even though seeing his wife held at gunpoint. The battle of wits and wills begins.But does it? ""Trespass"" starts out pretty good, but quickly becomes generic and predictable, with several familiar plot devices that have been frequently used in this thriller subgenre. To make matters worse, every time characters are given a chance to escape (or do whatever they want), they miss it in an inexplicable way. Expository flashbacks that attempt to add more mysteries just do not work, especially when the main plot about the robbery is uninteresting, not knowing where to go.Realizing that the film's story is not getting any better, I thought the stars Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman would do something to make it better. I was wrong. No charisma, no ""star power."" While Cage overacts, Kidman remains unmemorable. The two Oscar-winning players add nothing to the film that remains mostly unoriginal.

Firewall(which was great), Hostage, The Strangers, Panic Room (great), Funny Games, and the list goes on. This movies is basically a parody of itself. The F word flies around like a swarm of locusts, killing any chance of any kid of meaningful, creative dialogue. And a premise? Wow, breaking into someones house who really has no money, seriously? I don't think Joel Shulmaker has really made any ""stellar"" films, but he is (was) a decent director. Why big stars like Cage and Kidman are in such a hideous picture, basically straight to DVD, is beyond me. I just hope a lot of these stars aren't getting the Cuba Gooding Jr syndrome. It seems a lot of older actors are being pushed into crappy straight to DVD films these days. And some good ones as well, but few. All this movie does is really irritate the viewer, other than the foul language there is not a quiet moment, or emotional one in the whole film. Everyone rants around like they forgot to take there meds, just screaming and yelling at each other till you get a headache and say ok enough. Don't just kill the hostages, just kill everyone in the movie! This is definitely Cages worst performance, although he has had a few bad ones in the past. He actually uses words like $$#thole and A##F%$k, real great dialogue there. Also he whines like a little girl through most of the film, trying to fend off the bad dudes, but the girls overpower him and end up kicking more tail than he does. He mainly lays on the ground bleeding and/or crying or both.So sorry it contains spoilers, not that anyone is ""dying"" to see this film, but it's really as bad as the critics and audience says it is. Which usually might or not be true. In this case it's painfully true, don't let this movie ""trespass"" into your movie collection. The other blu rays will skoot off the shelve just to avoid it.
