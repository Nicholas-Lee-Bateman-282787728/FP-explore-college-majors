944109,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BKVQRU,A Customer,"[8, 13]","In The Wedding Crashers, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are lawyers who get their kicks by boozily and audaciously infiltrating the nuptials of strangers. The silly but cheerful John (Wilson) and fast-talking and manipulative Jeremy (Vaughn) have adopted an annual ritual of going randomly to weddings under assumed names in order to have a good time, picking up unattached women for quick, no-commitment trysts.For them it's all about the sex, drinking, and the rock and roll as they ply their trade at ceremonies of various faiths and ethnic backgrounds. Along the way the champagne flows and they get to meet lots of sexually voracious and beautiful young girls. Lately, however, their hedonistic life seems to be catching up with them - this particular season has been particularly exhausting, but when they discover that high powered Defense Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) is having a bash for his older daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), they cannot resist attending.John falls for Claire, but unfortunately Claire already has a fianc&eacute;, in the form of the smarmy and not-very-nice-preppie Sack (Bradley Cooper). Meanwhile, Jeremy finds himself stuck with Cleary's youngest daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher), who's a real spitfire, and who mistakenly tells Jeremy that she's a virgin after they both have a quickie on the beach. When Gloria gets her father to invite the boys for a weekend at the Cleary holiday home, they discover that this family is more dysfunctional than they realized.The Secretary's alcoholic wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour) comes on to John, while foul-mouthed grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow) verbally assaults everyone, and spews homophobic jokes at the dinner table, especially to artist grandson Todd (Keir O'Donnell), who in turn visits Jeremy's room to make a pass at him at the very time when the poor fellow has been literally tied to his guest bed by the voracious Gloria.There's no doubt that the Wedding Crashers is punctuated with some funny moments, but the film is ultimately hampered by an overall sloppiness of execution and direction. It isn't nearly as funny as it should be, with the long running jokes eventually wearing thin, and the comedic elements failing to sit easily with the love story between John and Claire.  The film also drags the setup scenario on for far too long and the whole film over extends itself by about thirty minutes.The biggest problem with this film, however, is that it fails to be funny when it starts to take itself too seriously. In the labored third act, when its ne'er-do-well heroes inevitably go soft and redeem themselves - and a predictable and overrated guest star appears to offer an extraordinarily tiresome cameo - one gets the feeling that it's all just degenerated into a lurching, lumpy, semi-improvised sketch comedy. By movie's end one hopes that the boys contrived search for redemption should be wrapped up as quickly as possible, but here it's prolonged to such length that the movie threatens never to end.Vince Vaughan is a talented and funny actor, but in this movie he borders on irritating, and Owen Wilson, although somewhat sweet, would have to be one of the most innocuously untalented actors working today. Their back-and-forth frat-boy bickering is amusing for twenty minutes or so, but then steadily becomes annoying. Sloppily, directed by David Dobkin we watch John and Jeremy as they banter, crash, lie, banter, and then crash again until it all becomes a bit repetitive and stale.The veterans suffer too, especially Jane Seymour who ultimately has little to do. She literally has one of the best and funniest scenes in the film, yet her character is absolutely wasted; the producers could have made so much more of her. And then there's Walken as Secretary Cleary, who's portrayed as a hot presidential prospect, but quickly turns into an unrealistic dolt.I guess you could wrap up the Wedding Crashers by saying that it's sporadically amusing but like most weddings it generally flags in enthusiasm towards the end and the final scenes are as predictable as they are characteristically unwelcome. If viewers want to see a good, bawdy comedy that sustains the humor until the end, they should take a look at The Forty-Year-Old Virgin instead.

It was the most fun I have had watching a movie in a long time. The story line was great. Two thirty-somethings are still trying to live out there youth and crash wedding after wedding to sleep with as many beautiful women as possible. Then one of the main characters falls in love with a girl he meets at a wedding while the other main character has a psycho fall in love with him. They are invited back to the two girls summer home and chaos ensues. I loved every character in this movie. Owen Wilson was awesome, and Vince Vaughn took control of this movie and in my opinion stole the show. Then there was Christopher Walken who played his part perfectly. He was very funny and could take control of a scene with little or no effort. Then of course there was the ninety year old grandma who was a racist foul-mouthed, but sweet old lady. I'm not gonna list em all, but let me just say that there wasn't a single actor who didn't give an amazing and hilarious performance. I have to give the directors and writers their praises too, by making this a movie everyone can watch. This movie has nudity galore, horribly foul language, and some sexual situations. On the other hand, it also has one of the most romantic storylines i've ever seen.

Here we have a movie with two of the most solid new comic movie personas with in the last ten years and they're teamed together.  These two fit together on paper let alone on the first day of production so the film is filled with charm and humor, but for anyone who thinks this film is just for the guys to go to, or trick their girlfriends/wives to seeing, there's a strong them within the film about love and it's so strong that I wouldn't even call it a subplot.  What's interesting is that there are elements of the mainstream chick flick in this film, making it highly accessible.  The problem I have with this film is that is just doesn't seem like a natural fit, but all the necessary parts are there.  They just don't quite fit to me. As much as I like the fact that the film presents a really strong female character and is also a semi-sex comedy is good news, but the film doesn't mesh these two elements together in a good way.  Don't get me wrong, the film would be totally able to get away with its lack of attention to finetuning if it didn't stop for the love story angle, the poignancy allows you to see just how shoddy it is.  While I know that the films are as different as fruits, ""There's Something About Mary"" was the last raunchy comedy to succesfully pull off the love angle and still feel well done and while other Farelly Brothers films of similar plotline haven't had the courage to go as far and limit their hijinks to pg-13 levels of vulgarity and profanity.  I think a film can be funny without that stuff, but that's not the kind of movie I'm reviewing.  I'm reviewing a balls to the wall, 'uncorked' movie full of profanity, sex, and nudity.  A film that lets it all hang without concern for rating knowing that it's geared to an older audience.  I understand all the people that applaud this film for going there and being funny while also attempting to be poignant, however, it wasn't a good idea for them to release their film around the same time only to compared to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" which has it beat on poignant points and might be funnier in a more realistic way than ""Wedding Crashers.""  ""Wedding Crashers"" made more money and so my opinion doesn't really matter, and I'm in the minority, but the film isn't completely bad, it just isn't well done in my opinion and there are things in the film that are memorable, like Will Ferrell's character at the end and Vince Vaughn's turn into love, but overall, it's a movie of excesses that it can't legitimize dramatically (and by dramatically, I mean they could have been more fun).",2,I understand why people love this movie,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2709,"['Wedding', 'Crashers', 'return', 'rated', 'R', 'nudity', 'sex', 'filled', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'was', 'made', 'popular', '80', 'then', 'died', 'out', 'Here', 'have', 'movie', 'two', 'most', 'solid', 'new', 'comic', 'movie', 'personas', 'last', 'ten', 'years', ""'re"", 'teamed', 'together', 'two', 'fit', 'together', 'paper', 'let', 'alone', 'first', 'day', 'production', 'film', 'filled', 'charm', 'humor', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'just', 'guys', 'go', 'trick', 'girlfriends/wives', 'seeing', 'strong', 'film', 'love', 'so', 'strong', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'subplot', 'What', 'interesting', 'are', 'elements', 'mainstream', 'chick', 'flick', 'film', 'making', 'highly', 'accessible', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'natural', 'fit', 'necessary', 'parts', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'fact', 'film', 'really', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'also', 'semi-sex', 'comedy', 'good', 'news', 'film', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'two', 'elements', 'together', 'good', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'lack', 'attention', 'finetuning', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'poignancy', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'shoddy', 'know', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'fruits', 'Something', 'Mary', 'was', 'last', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'succesfully', 'pull', 'off', 'love', 'angle', 'still', 'feel', 'well', 'done', 'other', 'Farelly', 'Brothers', 'films', 'similar', 'plotline', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'courage', 'go', 'far', 'limit', 'hijinks', 'pg-13', 'levels', 'vulgarity', 'profanity', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'stuff', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', ""'m"", 'reviewing', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'balls', 'wall', ""'uncorked"", 'movie', 'full', 'profanity', 'sex', 'nudity', 'film', 'hang', 'concern', 'rating', 'knowing', 'geared', 'older', 'audience', 'understand', 'people', 'applaud', 'film', 'going', 'there', 'being', 'funny', 'also', 'attempting', 'be', 'poignant', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'release', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'compared', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'beat', 'poignant', 'points', 'might', 'be', 'funnier', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'so', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', ""'m"", 'minority', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'well', 'done', 'opinion', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'memorable', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'end', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'turn', 'love', 'overall', 'movie', 'excesses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'legitimize', 'dramatically', 'dramatically', 'mean', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun']",N/A

Yes, `Wedding Crashers' may be one clich&eacute; after another, but those clich&eacute;s are strung together so effortlessly that you can't help but fall for each and every gag.The film follows two friends, John and Jeremy, who make a habit of crashing weddings to score with single chicks.  When they crash the wedding of Secretary William Cleary's daughter, Christina, they wind up on an adventure they didn't bank on.  At the wedding they each set their sights on one of Secretary Cleary's other daughters; Jeremy targeting the nymphomaniac Gloria and John seeking out the beautiful, yet spoken for, Claire.  When they wind up invited to the Cleary's estate for the weekend (who in their right mind would invite two men they've never met to their home for the weekend) hilarity ensues.  While John is busy trying to woo Claire away from her controlling boyfriend Zachary Jeremy is trying to ward off the advances of Gloria.I've never been a huge fan of Owen Wilson, and I still hold firm to the belief that he is only really `good' when paired with Ben Stiller (together they are flawless).  Here he winds up being the more straight laced actor and, while he has a few funny lines, really leaves the comedy aspect of the film up to scene partner Vince Vaughn.  `Wedding Crashers' marked Vaughn's rebirth so-to-speak, revitalizing his career thanks to one hilarious performance here (although I saw this coming since his glorious `Old School' turn).  I've always been a huge fan of Vaughn and loved some of his earlier work (I just adore his performances in films like `Return to Paradise' and `A Cool Dry Place') but it seemed like Hollywood had forgotten about him; and then there was `Wedding Crashers' and his career has never been the same.  I'm happy for him; he deserved it.Isla Fisher is really the standout here.  She has, undeniably, the scene-stealer role of the film and she does just that; steals scenes.  As Gloria she is sensual, abrasive, obnoxious, psychotic and most of all hilarious.  Rachel McAdams does a fine job as Claire in a role that is far less attention grabbing.  She is such a beautiful and talented actress.  I can't wait to see her career skyrocket.  Jane Seymour has a surprising turn here as the Secretary's unhappy wife and Ellen Alberti Dow is her usual funny self as the Cleary Grandmother.  Christopher Walken is quite simply Christopher Walken (shouldn't he be in like every movie).  Keir O'Donnell is a bit over the top as the strange Cleary son, Todd, and Bradley Cooper is kind of annoying as Zachary.  There is a brilliant cameo by Will Ferrell towards the end that makes me wish he had a larger role in the film.`Wedding Crashers' is not a god-send but it is well worth the watch through.  There are moments when the laughs will come so hard there will be tears and then times when the laughs are more of an embarrassed laugh.

If so, I would probably give this movie 3.5 stars rather than 4, because, while it is very funny, I'm not sure if it is truly worhty of 4 stars.  However, I am rounding up, seeing as how it is definitely better than a 3 star movie.John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are wedding crashers.  They go to weddings with the sole intention of sleeping with women; they figure that the emotions that go hand-in-hand with a wedding make girls easier.  They come up with thourough backstories, names, and family connections so as not to raise suspicions toward themselves, and they follow a set of rules handed down to them by Chaz Reginold (Will Ferrel in an awesome cameo), an ex-crasher who is like the Elvis Presley of wedding crashing.  John and Jeremy are also successful divorce counselors when they aren't crashing.Near the end of ""wedding season"" one year, Jeremy is able to get them into a high-class wedding, where the bride is the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken).  While at the wedding, John meets Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy meets Gloria (Ilsa Fisher), both of whom are the bride's sisters.  Jeremy scores with Gloria, but it turns out that Claire has a boyfriend (Bradley Cooper), who of course is a brute and is cheating on Claire.  Jeremy is ready to leave, but John tries to stay in order to get closer to Claire.  This allows the somewhat insane and chemically imbalanced Gloria (she had an entire army of invisible friends as a kid) to get the pair invited to a weekend at one of the Secretary's mansions on a small island.While John tries to court Claire, Jeremy tries to avoid Gloria, who actually, at one point, rapes him (she doesn't see it that way, though).For the most part, this movie delivered very well.  It was a tad inconsistent, where at one point, people would laugh so loud that the dialogue was drowned out, but there were a few points when not much was going on.  The only truly slow point was near the end.One thing that I really liked dealt with Walken's character.  Instead of making him the stereotypical father-knows-best chacracter, they made him an actual father who just wanted his daughters to be happy.If you're a fan of the so-called ""brat pack"" (Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Jack Black), you'll love this movie.

What you get from this film is nonstop laughs. I have never heard a theater roar with laughter as much as I did when I saw this last night. And I was roaring right along with them.Best friends John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are two D.C. divorce lawyers who seem mild mannered and sweet, but lead a secret double life of sorts. When they're not letigating in divorce cases, they are professional wedding crashers. Under assumed names, they attend weddings, pretend they're guests, and score with the bridesmaids. For three years, the plan goes off without a hitch, as John and Jeremy have sex with dozens of bridesmaids. However, things change when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the U.S. Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken, great as always). When they crash the reception, John and Jeremy wind up with the secretary's other two daughters. John falls hard for the shy, conservative Claire (Rachel McAdams), while the slightly maniacal Gloria (Isla Fisher, who actually steals the show in every scene she's in) becomes obsessed with Jeremy. To make matters, worse, the secretary's wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour, who is aging wonderfully and actually has a (spoiler alert) nude scene) also has a thing for John. The secretary takes a liking to the boys, and invites them back to his shore house. There, everything goes wrong. Jeremy is injured in a football game several game by Claire's violent boyfriend and is forcefully seduced not only by Gloria but by the Clearys' homosexual artists son Tod (Kier O'Donnell). John is seduced by Mrs. Cleary and tries to woo Claire, angering her boyfriend. There's also the hilarious Grandma Cleary (Ellen Albertini Dow), whose un-PC comments had the theater in tears. Claire's boyfriend gets suspicious of their true identities (John and Jeremy supposedly own a maple syrup business), as does Mr. Cleary. From here on in, the film becomes somewhat predictable, as the boys are revealed and they stop talking etc., but it really doesn't matter since the film is still absolutely hilarious.The film is absolutely perfect. Outstanding performances are given by all (especially Isla Fisher), the plot is believable and never formulaic, and the laughs are nonstop. Also, be on the lookout for cameos by Dwight Yokum, Rebecca DeMornay, John McCain, James Carville (yes, the politician), and one certain actor who will remain nameless in this review.

While the first hour had a few laughs, the second became bogged down in a sappy romance, and had me checking the ""time remaining,"" on my DVD player. While it wasn't a bad movie, I saw a lot of wasted potential in it. The concept of wedding crashing is funny, I just wanted them to do more with it. For example, the main characters allude to attending a variety of ethnic weddings (Hindu, Chinese, etc.) but we aren't shown much. It would have worked better if they cut the romance a bit, and showed us more of the weddings. The extravagant lies one would have to tell and ensuing complications seem like they would be a rich source of comedy, but are never exploited. Also, Christopher Walken is a wonderful comedic actor (see him on Saturday Night Live as ""The Continental"" and the music producer for Blue Oyster Cult, to know what I mean), but his talents are wasted here in a humorless, straight role.",3,It was O.K.,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,1021,"['most', 'surprising', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'such', 'very', 'average', 'comedy', 'could', 'become', 'such', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'first', 'hour', 'had', 'few', 'laughs', 'second', 'became', 'bogged', 'down', 'sappy', 'romance', 'had', 'checking', 'time', 'remaining', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'saw', 'lot', 'wasted', 'potential', 'concept', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'funny', 'just', 'wanted', 'do', 'more', 'example', 'main', 'characters', 'allude', 'attending', 'variety', 'ethnic', 'weddings', 'Hindu', 'Chinese', 'etc', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'cut', 'romance', 'bit', 'showed', 'more', 'weddings', 'extravagant', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'tell', 'ensuing', 'complications', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'rich', 'source', 'comedy', 'are', 'never', 'exploited', 'Also', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'wonderful', 'comedic', 'actor', 'see', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Continental', 'music', 'producer', 'Blue', 'Oyster', 'Cult', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'humorless', 'straight', 'role']",N/A

I almost couldn't help it though -- Jim Carrey and his facial expressions and voice inflections are too much. My uproarious laughter during this movie stems from the hilarious and witty dialogue spoken by two comic greats -- Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. Talk about an amazing team! Truth be told, I'm not a big fan of movies like Anchorman or Old School or Dodegball, so I went into the theater expecting something similar. I would say that fans of the previously mentioned movies won't be disappointed with Wedding Crashers and neither should anyone else. It's a fantastic comedy.Wilson and Vaughn star as John and Jeremy, two guys who can't wait till wedding season. They love the food, they love making up stories and background information about the ""characters"" they're going to be, and oh yeah, the women. The main reason for crashing weddings is to bed as many bridesmaids as possible. And they're good. After watching a montage of weddings that these guys crash, Jeremy decides they should end the season with one last hoorah. John reluctantly agrees; he was looking forward to putting wedding season behind him. Then it happens -- John falls in love with a pretty bridesmaid (Rachel McAdams, Mean Girls; The Notebook). Suddenly he's breaking the rules of wedding crashing -- never stay too long, don't get involved, etc. Unfortunately for Jeremy, he slept with a crazy, clingy redhead who confessed that she loved him after only two hours of knowing him. She sticks to him like glue the entire time, and the look on his face everytime she kisses him is hilarious. The girl's family is kooky -- cursing grandmother, wacky brother, politician father, and of course, the girl has a jerky boyfriend. What's a wedding crasher to do?How many times can I describe this movie as hilarious? Well, however long it takes to get you to the theater to see it. You won't regret it, you'll be laughing so hard that your side will actually hurt. This movie isn't without physical comedy, but the best stuff is in the dialogue, which is better than most dramas (remind me why dramas are so popular... oh yeah, the ""riveting dialogue,"" something said way too often by film critics).

944128,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000BKVQRU,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","I have to say that this movie surprised in two ways. I was surprised with what the movie was like, and just as surprised that it wasn't what I thought it would be. What do I mean?. I was expecting the movie to be pretty raunchy and over the top along the lines of more recent comedy fare. It wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it does get a little nutty with some R rated material, but it wasn't like it is in other raunchier comedies. I was also surprised that it was a nicer film with more heart than I was expecting. It's still an R rated film all the way though. It took me a while to laugh because the movie doesn't really get funny until 45 minutes into the film. Once they crash the big wedding and hook up with the girls and their family, then it starts becoming funny. Just wait. It'll come. I was also never a real fan of either Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, but I liked them a great deal here and will keep an open mind about them from now on. The two star as a couple of friends who, come wedding season, crash the festivities to have a good time, eat good food, drink good wine, and possibly bed some women. They get into more than they can handle when they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Secretary of Treasury(Christopher Walken). John(Owen) meets Claire(Rachel McAdams), the middle daughter, and Jeremy(Vince) meets Gloria, the youngest daughter, who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic. In what becomes very predictable, John actually falls for Claire, who is with a rich creep(also very predictable), and Jeremy tries to flee from the crazy Gloria. The movie is basically very routine. You know what will happen the second it starts, and you know how it will all play out in the end. The movie offers no real surprises, but it makes up for it in plenty to laugh at, fun performances, and a slick direction. Christopher Walken is a god, but he has nothing to really do here. He just seems to be there to be the ""dad"" looming over the happenings and keep everyone together. Plus, it seems kinda strange to me to see Walken being the ""dad"". Jane Seymour has a fun little role that plays against what we usually get from her. She also looks fantastic!. McAdams is as sweet as apple pie and looks even better. I can see why she is supposed to be the next big thing. You can't stop looking at her. Bradley Cooper from ""Alias"" is only there as a cliched and predictable plot tool. Our two stars?. Both carry the film very well. They work and play off of each other nicely. Vaughn has a knack for this kind of comedy and character, but Wilson doesn't match him quite as well. The big cameo towards the end is fun, and it would be a hoot to see a film about that character!. Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay also appear in quick cameos at the very beginning. The ending can be seen a mile away, but it doesn't lessen how nice it is. Wedding Crashers is not perfect, nor is it as side splitting funny as other films, but it is fun, funny, and very enjoyable.

But both can be largely attributed to ripping off ideas from other movies- ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Meet the Parents"" come immediately to mind. I like Wilson, but find Vaughn to be the most over rated actor of our time. Neither is worthy of the ""funniest thing I've ever seen"" proclomations I've heard before seeing this myself. It seems that their mere presence in this flick is supposed to make us laugh (as can be said about the obligatory cameo by Will Ferrell, who continues to spit out b-grade SNL skit material to people who would laugh at him clipping his toenails), particularly in contrived, uninspired scenes that one can see coming from a mile away. Christopher Walken coasts, but can do no more without many lines to make use of his talents. He's merely another brand name to draw laughs from his mere presence, unlike his hilarious cameo in, say, ""Mousehunt,"" that gets more laughs from less camera time. This movie panders to the sensitivity of the FM audience, the sophomoric nature of its audience- mostly male, but certainly not entirely. In the process this movie falls into the ""insults the audiences intelligence (as it were)"" category, as much as a Will Smith ""comedy"" like ""Hitch"". It jerks you for laughs, in hopes you never saw these duplicated scenes from movies they ripped off. Then goes for the sweet touchy moments to snare the softer sentiments of the crowd. That's not to mention all the other cliches it hammers out- the strangely weird family member and apparently undersexed mother of the desired girl, the potty mouthed old lady, or the cute little girl and/or cute but tempermental little boy that demands his ""baloon bicycle."" Hilarious? If you're a sucker for over milked material, I suppose. There are hundreds of comedies that not only do I own, but will still watch them in their entirity when on the Dish, again and again, some in which i've seen nearly a hundred times.

I've lately halted when I hear resounding praise lavished on films with nary a single negative comment to be found. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was one such film that I enjoyed but didn't live up to the brouhaha surrounding it.And such was the case with WEDDING CRASHERS ...Although pleasantly funny and entertaining (note the ""thumbs up"" rating I gave it for sheer entertainment), the film lost much of its lighthearted punch as the story bogged down in the drama surrounding its two main characters, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson, STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn, DODGEBALL).The basic premise is about these two longtime friends who enjoy crashing as many weddings as possible. They have hundreds of rules that each of them follows (""Rule #1: Never leave a fellow crasher alone"", etc) ...that is until John falls for a beautiful woman named Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, THE NOTEBOOK) and all bets are called off.John and Jeremy's friendship appears to be on the rocks as John falls harder and harder for Claire. But problems quickly arise for him. Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, THE PROPHECY), an authoritative man who wants his daughters to marry into families of wealth and power. The Cleary family is also pretty dysfunctional (""putting the `fun' in dysfunctional""). They have a son, Todd (Keir O'Donnell, IN YOUR FACE), who wants nothing to do with the family's politics and prefers painting evocative scenes in ""his own blood."" The Cleary mother, Kathleen (Jane Seymour, DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN), is sexually deprived and wants young men to ""touch her surgically enhanced breasts.""John clearly has a lot of obstacles to overcome ...and not just within the Cleary family. Claire's long-term boyfriend, Zack Lodge (Bradley Cooper, ALIAS), wants to know who John and Jeremy are and how they became so close to the Cleary family so quickly.As John's love for Claire grows, Jeremy is dragged further away from his friend by the surrounding circumstances and by another Cleary daughter with serious psychological issues that he later finds endearing._________________________________________________________________________________________As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film. At two hours in length, it's one of the more long-winded comedies I've seen.Mixing drama, romance and humor is always a challenge, and director David Dobkin admirably tries to hold it all together, and on some levels he does, but the ending fell flat with no laughs and zero character growth (they just expand their wedding crasher community from two to four members).I will say that seeing Jane Seymour in such a different role surprised me. She played the part of a bored politician's wife extremely well. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn; men who never grew up. Whenever they're on-screen together, however, there were definitely some great comedic moments (""Oh. You didn't hear. My brother had a diving accident and he's retarded now."")But if you're looking for a high quality comedy, this isn't it. It is funny at times, but when compared to such masterpieces as THE BIG LEBOWSKI or OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, it seriously pales.",4,"Three-and-a-Half Stars, Really.

They've known each other for 17 years, work together, and in there spare time crash wedding parties; where they drink like sailors, mingle with unsuspecting relatives, and hit on single and willing brides maids every chance they get. They have a whole science to their crashing ( rules and all), and have become quite adept at the sport.That all changes when they attend a wedding held by Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken), whose daughter is getting hitched. During the lavish formal affair, Jeremy makes headway with Cleary's physcopath daughter Gloria ( a hilarious Isla Fisher), while John slowly maneuvers his way into the life of the Secretary's other daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), who just happens to have a steady bo' of her own.Eventually, after all the formalities-- the two are privately invited back to the Secretary's estate, where they play touch football with the family, have formal dinners, sail out on the boat, & get hit on by the Secretary's sex starved wife (Jane Seymour) & his homosexual son Todd (Keir O'Donnell).Its all very funny and silly- but the great chemistry by Wilson and Vaughn helps the film move at a steady pace. The supporting roles of McAdams and Fishler are nicely fleshed out as well. While no means a great movie, ""The Wedding Crashers"" is quite funny at times, and overall enjoyable.Some people have called this a raunchy, gross-out comedy; although I noticed nothing of the sort. Besides the dialogue and a few breast shots, theres really nothing raunchy or gross-out about ""Wedding Crashers"" at all.

944151,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B000BKVQRU,Chris,"[20, 29]","Ever since ""Old School"" was released in 2003, there have been several movies that have basically the same cast of actors.  Those actors are Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and one of the Wilson Brothers.  I think this is a great group of guys to co-star in comedies together.  They each have their own respective comedic styles and when put together, it feeds well off eachother.  ""Wedding Crashers"" is the latest collaboration of this group of actors, and once again the results are similar.The premise of ""Wedding Crashers"" is that a couple of friends, John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn), have a annual tradition of going to weddings by pretending to be family friends.  The purpose?  To pick up on girls that are so caught up in the loving, romantic atmosphere of the wedding that they will be willing to do pretty much what John and Jeremy want.  BRILLIANT!!!  At a wedding for the daughter of Secretary of State (I think) William Clearly, John falls for one of Clearly's other daughters, Claire.  Jeremy on the other hand ""makes love"" to Clearly's youngest daughter, Gloria.  Well Gloria turns out to be a pyscho that immediately falls in love with Jeremy and invites him and John to spend the weekend at their house.  From there, funny situations happen.  The Clearlys find out that John and Jeremy aren't who they claim they are and John and Jeremy learn that their ways are wrong and become new men.  Pretty much the standard for romantic-type comedies.First of all, this is Vince Vaughn's movie.  He is the star.  He has the funniest scenes, the best one-lines and brings the best presence to the screen.  I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson's comedy, but he did a fine job in this film.  The movie itself was really funny.  The only problem that I had with it is that it was too long and that it got really slow in the last twenty minutes.  Also, you get to see some topless women, so thats always a plus.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  As mentioned earlier, Vince Vaughn completely carried this movie.  Without him I don't want to think of what this movie might have been.  Its definitely a good choice if you're wanting to see a movie.",4,I Feel Like Going To A Wedding,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2171,"['Ever', 'Old', 'School', 'was', 'released', '2003', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'movies', 'have', 'basically', 'same', 'cast', 'actors', 'actors', 'are', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'one', 'Wilson', 'Brothers', 'think', 'great', 'group', 'guys', 'co-star', 'comedies', 'together', 'have', 'own', 'respective', 'comedic', 'styles', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'eachother', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'latest', 'collaboration', 'group', 'actors', 'once', 'again', 'results', 'are', 'similar.The', 'premise', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'couple', 'friends', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'have', 'annual', 'tradition', 'going', 'weddings', 'pretending', 'be', 'family', 'friends', 'purpose', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'loving', 'romantic', 'atmosphere', 'wedding', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'want', 'BRILLIANT', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Secretary', 'State', 'think', 'William', 'Clearly', 'John', 'one', 'Clearly', 'other', 'daughters', 'Claire', 'Jeremy', 'other', 'hand', 'love', 'Clearly', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Gloria', 'Well', 'Gloria', 'out', 'be', 'pyscho', 'immediately', 'love', 'Jeremy', 'John', 'spend', 'weekend', 'house', 'there', 'funny', 'situations', 'happen', 'Clearlys', 'find', 'out', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'claim', 'are', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'learn', 'ways', 'are', 'wrong', 'become', 'new', 'men', 'Pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'romantic-type', 'comedies.First', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'movie', 'star', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'best', 'one-lines', 'best', 'presence', 'screen', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'comedy', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'got', 'really', 'slow', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Also', 'get', 'see', 'topless', 'women', 'thats', 'always', 'plus.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'completely', 'carried', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'definitely', 'good', 'choice', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'see', 'movie']",N/A
944152,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000BKVQRU,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","Okay, I can finally review this film legitimately. I posted a previous review that complained that they don't release the UNRATED versions at the movie theatre. I mean, think about what a ridiculous practice this is.  Imagine if they had released an edited version of ANIMAL HOUSE at the movie theatre and later an UNRATED version... BLAZING SADDLES, CADDY SHACK or STRIPES.Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm complaining about, because I save money by not going to the movie theatre and later buying the ENTIRE VERSION OF THE FILM LATER ON DVD. It's just why go to the movie theatre to see an edited version?Okay... yada, yada, yada... the movie:The movie is very well done and unlike most movies that are made these days, will probably be remembered for years to come. With its no-holds-barred approach to the subject of irresponsible sex it manages to combine a lot of realism and truth to an absurd situation. You know, because we've all probably met somebody just like these guys. In fact, we've all probably been a little like them at some point in our lives.The movie is well done and is gifted with numerous surprises and unorthodox story-telling WHICH IS GREAT!! BECAUSE LIFE IS UNORTHODOX! Human nature is unexplainable and people do crazy and unexplainable things.Wedding Crashers tells the story of two professionally single guys who basically crash weddings looking for sex with women. They're pros at it, but a trip to the wedding of Secretary Treasurer William Cleary's daughter sends them down a path of looniness, romance and sex.They soon find out that the wealthy and privileged aren't immune to being dysfunctional families and when the heart wants to take you somewhere, the mind is powerless.WEDDING CRASHERS has numerous memorable scenes that will have you in stitches. Vince Vaughn is fantastic as a selfish, fast-talking snake oil salesman with the soul purpose of GETTING SOME. In fact, everybody in the cast did fantastic. The guy who played Todd Cleary (Keir O'Donnell) killed me every time he appeared on screen. No words. Just his look. Isla Fisher was charming, dirty and hilarious. Grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow) was fantastic. I remembered her instantly as the rapping grandma from THE WEDDING SINGER. Rachel McAdams was beautiful as could be, and I had no problems believing that Owen Wilson's character would fall for her at first sight.I don't have a whole lot to complain about with WEDDING CRASHERS. It was a really good and memorable movie, but I just wish, as unorthodox and fresh as the movie was, that the ending had not been so CLICHE'!Owen Wilson even says at the end...

944156,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B000BKVQRU,Cinephiliac,"[9, 11]","Wedding Crashers is the story of John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn), who work as arbitrators, mediating in difficult divorce cases.  Each year these two lifelong best friends take the month of June off to infiltrate weddings of every description.John and Jeremy are natural born shape-shifters, adapting to any circumstance.  Armed only with vast quantities of bravado and an ethnically appropriate back-story, these guys are in search of an endless party and beautiful women.  As a woman, I felt I should probably be offended on behalf of my sex at their ""let's get in, seduce a lot of women and get out"" mentality.  However, they are so likeable and their tactics are so over-the-top and so shamelessly manipulative, you just can't help laughing.  They are also the life of any party.  Dancing with the flower girls, tying balloon animals for the kids and schmoozing with the elderly guests, they are also the first ones up for a vigorous hora or polka, pulling the more reticent guests up with them as they go.As the wedding season closes out, John starts to lose some of his enthusiasm for the enterprise.  These ""one afternoon stands"" are a bit like only eating dessert - it might sound really good on paper but it will leave you feeling pretty lousy after a while.  He's also beginning to feel that they are a little too old to be doing this sort of thing.  Jeremy soon convinces John to crash just one more wedding - the wedding of the daughter of U.S. Treasury Secretary, William Cleary (Christopher Walken).Posing as venture capital high-rollers, John and Jeremy sneak past the Secret Service. John is immediately attracted to Claire (Rachel McAdams), one of the bride's sisters.  Saving her from an embarrassingly dismal wedding toast, the two immediately click, but bad timing in the arrival of Sack (Bradley Cooper), Claire's ivy league, horse's rump of a boyfriend, prevent them from getting better acquainted.Jeremy meanwhile more than meets his match in the form of the bride's other sister, Gloria (the delightfully demented Isla Fisher).  After closing the deal (ahem) with Gloria, Jeremy finds himself unable to shake her off.  Jeremy describes her to John as ""completely off the reservation"" and he's not wrong.  She is the poster child for clingy and inappropriate behavior.  It is interesting to see the 6'5"" Vaughn equally attracted to and afraid of this tiny woman.Jeremy is able to wangle a weekend invitation to the Cleary estate for John to spend more time with the woman of his dreams.  The Cleary Clan are one strange bunch:  a racist elderly matriarch, Grandma Mary Cleary (Ellen Albertini Dow), Secretary Cleary's sexually inappropriate wife, Kathleen (Jane Seymour), and his wound-way-too-tight artistic son, Todd (Keir O'Donnell).John and Jeremy survive a game of homicidal touch football and one of the more wildly loony dinner parties ever put on film.  You have to admire Jeremy.  He is ready to leave almost immediately and endures the brunt of the Cleary Clan's unwholesome attention, but he hangs in there for his friend.  After suffering a series of late night, unwelcome and increasingly abusive visits from the various deranged Cleary family members, Vaughn's hyper-verbal panic attacks are some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Others have covered in great detail the lowbrow nature of the comedy.  It is very politically incorrect.  It may have you rolling your eyes or even groaning at times.  (I suppose I am not that easily offended.)  I didn't expect too much going in and was very pleasantly surprised.  I found it to be a good natured, high octane romp.  If you are willing to adjust your expectations accordingly, you may as well.  Vaughn and Owens have a great chemistry.  Vaughn's manic energy is a perfect counter to Owens' more laidback, wry style.Will John be able to woo Claire away from Sack?  Has Jeremy found the perfect woman in Gloria?  Will they be exposed as the totally lying horndogs they are?  (I don't want to spoil the movie for you.)  I give it a solid 4-1/2 stars.

944157,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000BKVQRU,Clare Quilty,"[9, 13]","By now, their onscreen personas are firmly established.Vince Vaughn gravitates to playing slick, amusingly arrogant motor-mouths. Impossibly tall and hyper, he often resembles a chatty, severely hung-over stork.Owen Wilson usually portrays talkative characters, too, but he goes in the opposite direction. Laid-back but always a little shifty, he's like a slightly baked sheepdog.They make a good comedic duo and, as ""Wedding Crashers"" opens, they're Maryland divorce mediators trying to finesse an amicable split between an acrimonious couple.Finally, the ex-husband-to-be (Dwight Yoakam) wearily compromises provided the guys ""just stop talking.""But Jeremy (Vaughn) and John (Wilson) do talk a great game, and on weekends they like to schmooze their way into weddings to take advantage of the free food, booze and merriment. The nuptial atmosphere also seems to make women more susceptible to their come-ons and to lines such as, ""True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another,"" ... which actually is a pretty nice thought.The first third of ""Crashers"" follows the aging boys through a season of weddings, receptions and R-rated high-jinx, but just as the guys begin to lose interest in their scam, John falls for a bride's sister and Jeremy gets tangled up with a clingy flake he can't shake. The women, who are sisters, lure them to a seaside estate for a weekend with their family, a gang of nut jobs presided over by Christopher Walken (who, in the realm of actor/animal metaphors, has successfully patented himself as an intimidating iguana).If you've seen the previews, you know the drill. All the jokes in the ads are there - and a lot more - and the movie is good.The problem is, given the film's can't-miss premise and its extremely funny leads, ""Crashers"" should be almost great and it isn't. Some obvious problems bog it down.It's surprisingly long, a minute under two hours and, funny as it is, it feels long. No comedy about guys who crash weddings should stretch very far past 90 minutes; I mean, even ""War of the Worlds"" wrapped itself up in less time and that was about, well, a war of the worlds.Also, the movie's villain (Bradley Cooper, who plays Wilson's unfortunately named rival, Sack) is such a violent, hotheaded tool, he drains a lot of the fun out of the story. In a comedy, even the bad guy needs to be at least a little funny, but this one just doles out beatings, insults and creepy glares. By the end, I wanted to see Sack torn apart by carnivorous apes which - hate to spoil it - is not how ""Crashers"" ends.The movie is kind of all over the place, too. This is the first film in recent memory in which a genuinely touching scene about burgeoning love is stuck between a gag about bondage and footage of a guy vomiting into a toilet.Despite all its strange quirks and some sappiness at the end, though, ""Crashers"" hits much more often than it misses. I laughed a lot (Vaughn's confession to a priest - played by Henry Gibson, no less - is the funniest scene I've seen this year). I only wish the opening and closing credits were a little closer together.",4,"""Never leave a fellow crasher behind!""

944159,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BKVQRU,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","That was actually my first reaction to the film: it's not a raunchy comedy? The film is actually a situation comedy with swears and sex-related humor rather than just flatout grossness like American Pie. It ends up working because of the chemistry of the characters and some humor.John and Jeremy are wedding crashers, people who sneak into weddings pretending to be part of the group and impressing everyone and going home with a woman. Fake names and occupations are thrown out so they can have the best possible time. John however is starting to feel a little bit empty about it.Cue in the Treasury leader hosting a wedding for his daughter. Biggest wedding ever so why not crash that one too? Only this family is quite an odd one and they both find that out as Jeremy has a really oversexed girl Gloria while John meets Claire, the normal one but is with someone else(who, in a stereotypical role) is the ""jealous and bitter"" boyfriend.I think that's one problem I had with it: it's got too many comedy conventions. If you've seen a romantic comedy ever you know that guy does something to screw up and girl doesn't like him while guy tries to get her back and girl accepts. Come on people, I'm not spoiling anything. Also it's slightly underwritten. Jane Seymour playing the unfaithful wife of the Treasury head doesn't really do anything and pretty much just drops out.The film does work for the chemistry, not only in the 2 leading men but with their respective women. A standout is Isla Fisher playing the incredibly enthusiastic Gloria. While of course Christopher Walken is awesome, you just feel you could've needed more Walken(I refuse to do a cowbell-like joke involving more Walken).I found this funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin actually but still, could've used slightly more script work.

944170,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000BKVQRU,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[6, 8]","""Share that with the Dalai Llama, jackass!"" screams Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) in the raunchy and rautious sex comedy ""Wedding Crashers"". That line, along with ""Tatoo on the lower back? Might as well be a bulls-eye,"" epitamize his character. Vaughn, who usually plays the straight man to big stars (Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, ect.) is, for the most part, as crazy and funny as his comedy partner Owen Wilson. True, in the last act of the movie, when the film takes a tragicomic turn, Vince Vaughn idn't given many comedic lines, or much screen time. And throughout the rest of the movie co-star Isla Fisher gets on extremely raunchy, and hilarious, rants that make Vaughn's wildly profane monologues sound like Mother Goose. Rachel McAdams is unfortunately stuck in the cliched role, the only one in the movie, as the perfect girl/sister/daughter who is engaged to a WASP who is also an incredible jerk.John Beckswith (Owen Wilson) and his friend Jeremy Grey are Washington D.C. divorce attorneys. They spend the wedding season crashing other people's weddings to easily bed women. In the first twenty minutes, there is a montage of weddings that the duo crash. Italian, Indian, Jewish, Irish, ect. There is reason to think that the easy laughs in these minutes may not last the overlong two hour plus running time. You'd be wrong to assume this, though. The rest of the movie is actually funnier than these opening minutes. I would be lying if I said that the movie didn't get draggy in some parts. The last 40 minutes of the movie are spent on Owen Wilson sulking. The plot gets going when Jeremy convinces John to go to the Cleary wedding, which is being called ""The Kentucky Derby Of Weddings"". They go, and John meets Claire Cleary (McAdams) and immediately falls for her, even though her nuptuals are also approaching. Jeremy falls for Gloria Cleary (Fisher), the last of the single (unmarried) Cleary girls. Jeremy and Gloria escape to a nearby beach where they engage in an act of sexuality so profusely over-the-top and jokily graphic that it is indescribable. After the tryst, and finding out that he has just deflowered the state treasuer's (Christopher Walken) daughter, Jeremy wants to leave...fast. John, however, wants to stick around to spend more time with Claire, who he's charmed already. Gloria invites the two to her families Maine estate for the weekend. Jeremy begs off, but John says that they would love to go. Of course they go, or else there would be no plot. At the estate, the movie takes a turn for the incredibly raunchy and sex-infused. Jane Seymour plays Mama Cleary who asks John to fondle her newly done breasts. He does abligingly, but then gets a little to into it. More happens at the Cleary mansion, but to name them all off and describe them would ruin the rest of the movie.The last act of the movie focuses on the two after they leave the house. Jeremy goes bac to work, but John can't shake the fact that Claire is getting married in a few weeks. With cleverly devised plan, most of them that fail, Johhn tries to win her back. But this is before that act goes into Jeremy's future and John's depression. The last act gets tired after a while, and eventually runs out of steam. But that does not take away from the movies manic and entertaining pacing. Like all movies recently (""Stealth"", ""Skeleton Key"") ""Wedding Crashers"" goes on to long, but it is admittedly hard to imagine the movie without some of the scenes. There is one that follows Claire and John as they bike ride through a field of poseys and then ride down to a beach and play a hand game (not sexual-a shock for this movie) that could have been deleted. It's a well-meaning scene, but at nearly 10 minutes in length it feels too long (and is) and is unintentionally funny. ""Wedding Crashers"" marks the return of the raunchy sex comedy. Something we do not see enough of this day in age. The last one was the less funny but still entertaining ""Old School"", and this will be followed by ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" opening August 19th.""Wedding Crashers"" is 2 hours and 10 minutes.It is rated R for Strong Sexual Content And Dialogue/Nudity (many rather explicit sex scenes, characters describe sex acts in clinical terms, others describe sex acts in non-clinical terms, female nudity in a few scenes, and an implied comical scene of non-consensual sex (on the man's part, for a change), Language (40+ f-words plus countless other profanities), and Some Violence (a violent football game where somebody breaks their ankle, bloody fist fights, punches, a scene of quail hunting shows a dead bird and a man shot in the butt and we later see the buck shots being pulled out along with bloody wounds, a woman points a gun at a man and fires a shot towards him, missing him, she continues to hold the gun on him until another man comes and wrestles it away from her, one scene has characters firing guns at each other).",5,The Revival Of The Raunchy Sex Comedy Cometh,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,4917,"['Share', 'Dalai', 'Llama', 'jackass', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'raunchy',

944173,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B000BKVQRU,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 1]","'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a couple of partners in the divorce mediation business.  When the summer rolls around, the two romp through the Washington, D.C. wedding season crashing wedding ceremonies.  They follow a strict set of ""full proof"" rules in order to impress women that are overwhelmed by the emotions surrounding weddings into engaging in one night stands.Just when it looks like the wedding season has ended, the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, played by Christopher Walken, is set to be married.  Jeremy, Vaughn's character, impresses another of the Secretaries daughters, but has gotten more than he bargained for.  The wedding day fling quickly turns into an obsession, and Jeremy can't get away.  Meanwhile, John, Wilson's character, has fallen for yet another of the Secretary's daughters.  Problem is, despite hitting it off with her, she has an obnoxious boyfriend.  John can't let it go and finds himself prolonging the wedding day experience in an attempt to impress her.This movie is a lot of fun.  The ""Uncorked"" edition on the DVD is nice, but having watched the unrated and theatrical versions of the film, I think the theatrical version was just right.  The extra scenes added to the uncorked version weren't necessary and don't add much to the film.  Plus, the ""Uncorked"" version seems to run a bit long.  Fortunately, both versions are on the DVD.This movie is bested enjoyed if you take it with a grain of salt.  The portrayals of the characters are obvious caricatures of overzealous womanizers, unfaithful politicians, neurtoic and over sexed vixens, and overagressive ivy leaguers.  What makes the theatrical version so much fun is that it offers up outrageous scenes that hit just the right comedic level.I recommend this move to fans of Vaughn (who seems to be in everything these days) and Wilson.  There is a great cameo by a buddy of theirs in the later stages of the film, and those familiar with Wilson's films can probably narrow it down to one or two people.  This is also just a great comedy that should appeal to adults.

And don't get moi wrong:  WEDDING CRASHERS has some definite hysterical moments (I thought I was going to bust a gut during the quail hunting scene).  But even in a screwball comedy like this, there has to be the development of a story, and the characters, even as outrageous as they are, have to stay consistent.  But such is not the case here, as WEDDING CRASHERS meanders, dips, curls, stalls, and cartwheels into a big pile of ho-hum.Which is a shame, as the story had potential and merit, with divorce mediators John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crashing weddings in the D.C. area--all to pick up girls, girls in the romantic mood for love, due to the matrimony environment.  And such a guise works, and works well, until the two buddies crash a wedding of the daughter of powerful Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, who is absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional role).  John and Jeremy fall for the Secretary's other two daughters, and that's when this movie falls apart.  I mean, the wheels come off.There's nothing really left once the love interests are introduced, other than boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back.  Well, we do have the added dimension that John's love interest Claire (Rachel McAdams) has a fiance to contend with, and he's a very snobby Ivy League type.  Throw in some really bizarre scenes (e.g., any of the Cleary family dinner scenes) where the material isn't funny, but just comes off as plain weird, along with some slow and ineffective mushy scenes between Wilson and McAdams, and this movie slows to a crawl.  Definite head-scratching stuff, because it just doesn't mesh or work.Vaughn, as if he's trying to salvage this picture himself, is over the top and smothering in literally every scene he's in, while Wilson's character is all over the map:  irresponsible, responsible, mature, immature, reflective, ignorant, etc.  This guy really does some puzzling stuff, particularly at the end of the movie, which made me wonder if the writers decided to create an entirely different character than the one who began the picture.  And then Will Ferrell is brought in as a cameo as this two-hour marathon comes to an end, yet his appearance is bizarre, and definitely not funny.  Jane Seymour plays Walken's wacky and unfaithful wife; Jane still looks very good (and proves it in one scene), but her role is very typical of the entire movie.

Much of the action centers on the wedding of the daughter of U.S. Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken), where Vaughn and Owen manage to have liaisons with Sec. Cleary's two remaining daughters. Meanwhile the secretary's sex-obsessed wife hits on the two wedding crashers.Somewhat disillusioned by the end of the reception and its aftermath, Vaughn seeks out the advice of his wedding-crashing mentor, who is played by Will Ferrell. Ferrell's character, Chaz, who is still living with his mother, explains that he's no longer into weddings but has become a funeral crasher, since, as he explains, it's easy to get laid by a depressed chick. Not surprisingly, the movie ends with Vaughn and Wilson attending a funeral, trying to hit on the young women at the graveside.Although not deep and occasionally raunchy (although certainly not throughout), this movie is funny to hilarious most of the time, and it's carried by the excellent acting of Vaughn and Wilson, who have great chemistry.",5,"Great, mostly lighthearted fun",1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,1244,"['Join', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'avocation', 'wedding', 'crashers', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'science', 'coming', 'uninvited', 'weddings', 'join', 'festivities', 'eat', 'drink', 'silly', 'hit', 'unattached', 'attached', 'women', 'Much', 'action', 'centers', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'U.S.', 'Treasury', 'Secretary', 'Cleary', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'where', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'manage', 'have', 'liaisons', 'Sec', 'Cleary', 'two', 'remaining', 'daughters', 'Meanwhile', 'secretary', 'sex-obsessed', 'wife', 'hits', 'two', 'wedding', 'crashers.Somewhat', 'disillusioned', 'end', 'reception', 'aftermath', 'Vaughn', 'out', 'advice', 'wedding-crashing', 'mentor', 'who', 'played', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'Chaz', 'who', 'still', 'living', 'mother', 'no', 'longer', 'weddings', 'become', 'funeral', 'crasher', 'easy', 'get', 'laid', 'depressed', 'chick', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'movie', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'attending', 'funeral', 'trying', 'hit', 'young', 'women', 'graveside.Although', 'not', 'deep', 'occasionally', 'raunchy', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'most', 'time', 'carried', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry']",N/A

WEDDING CRASHERS is a movie that belongs in the latter category.As is known by most people before they watch it, the plot centers around two 30-something bachelors who arrive as unexpected guests at weddings of people whom they don't even know.  The plot is actually believable;  how many people do you see at weddings that you've never seen before in your life?  The objective, of course, is for them to ""score"" with the chicks who feel all Romantic and sensuous after the wedding festivities.While juvenile, the plan goes smoothly until one of them makes the critical ""mistake"" of falling for a girl he meets at a wedding.  From there the movie almost (and I stress almost) goes from being a party movie to being a Romantic comedy.The cast is splendid with Owen Wilson up to his usual tricks and Rachel McAdams as the sweet & loveable and innocent heart-stealer (not to mention eye-candy!).  20+ years after SOMEWHERE IN TIME, Jane Seymour is still gorgeous.  Christopher Walken is great as the intimidating father figure.  It's a delight to see distinguished actors like Seymour & Walken in a cinematic farce like this.If you like party movies or Romantic comedies, you'll more than likely fall for this one.

944181,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BKVQRU,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 2]","A great premise drives a hybrid comedy that mixes the ""buddy"" picture with ""American Pie"" hijinks and more conventional romantic comedy elements. It doesn't always work, but director David Dobkin and co-screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher get a lot of mileage out of the idea of two horndog divorce lawyers who crash weddings in their native D.C. area to lure sexually available women. Originating from a Big Kahuna of wedding crashing (who shows up late in the movie to offer an updated approach), the strategy of the partners in crime, John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, is to abide by their incessant rulebook and show up at events like they were invited and be prepared to present themselves with creatively concocted bios as tangible connections to either the bride or the groom.It all sounds like a prime opportunity for tasteless, vulgar humor and at various points, it is, but the film can also be surprisingly clever and even insightful. The set-up is actually more interesting than the ensuing plot, which relies much more on convention as it focuses on the high-profile nuptials of a US senator's daughter and the predictable romantic complications therein. As the smoother of the two, Owen Wilson plays John with his trademark glibness and laidback manner. In romancing the senator's middle daughter Claire, he even manages to eke out sincerity in measured doses, although he lacks the gravitas to be a truly effective romantic lead. As Jeremy, whether egging John about his exposure to the available breasts of the senator's wife, fending off the advances of Claire's sister and brother, or confessing profusely to a somewhat titillated minister, Vince Vaughn is a motor-mouthed riot, as he suffers an escalating number of indignities in order to keep up the guises while John woos Claire. Together, they are like a post-frat house version of Crosby and Hope in one of their Road movies.Christopher Walken plays the strait-laced senator with just a hint of his potential lunacy, though I was wishing he could break free more like he does in his ""Saturday Night Live"" skits. In a role that begs for the effortless savvy of Joan Allen or Jean Smart, the still-beautiful Jane Seymour just seems sadly misused as his wife. The current ""it"" girl, Rachel McAdams has the presence of mind and spirit to make more of the lackluster role of romantically confused Claire than there really is, though it's Isla Fisher who steals her scenes with abandon as Claire's alternately smitten and psychotic baby sister Gloria. Truth be told, the film starts to drag in the home stretch as it takes its time toward the inevitable conclusion, but the cleverly tasteless take on funerals is a nice jab. Regardless, Wilson and especially Vaughn, with his non-stop stream-of-consciousness wit, generate enough goodwill and laughs to compensate for the occasional lapses along the way.The ""Uncorked"" DVD package is somewhat disappointing. It contains two versions of the film, the original theatrical one and another billed as ""uncorked"", though the difference amounts to a few additional moments and lines here and there. There are two commentary tracks - an informative albeit by-the-numbers one by Dobkin and a looser though rather lazy and low-key one by Wilson and Vaughn. Neither is essential. There are four deleted scenes, including a karaoke scene with the two guys endlessly singing Nena's ""99 Luftballoons"".

By chance he meets a girl, way beyond his reach normally, who suddenly gives meaning to his life:  he wants to know her better, falls in love and wants to marry her - let's call her ""Required Honey.""  Unfortunately, she is betrothed to another guy - let's call him the ""Big Jerk"" character.  RH almost falls for LG, but rebounds to BJ when she discovers LG is either immature, a liar or has done something that betrays their budding romance.  But RH and LG should be together:  we know it, they know it, and we want them to be together.  Movies like this engage audiences by making them wait - thinking that the match might not take - until the inevitable ending.  LG's life predictably falls apart until, one way and another, he is reunited for the final ""BIG SCENE"" when he states his rebirth as a mature guy who wants to settle down with true love.  (Such a scene is often played out against an audience within an audience.)  All of this normally surrounds a wedding or weddings.This is a nutshell is ""Wedding Crashers.""  Does it sound like ""Wedding Singer""?  ""My Best Friend's Wedding""?  ""Three Weddings and a Funeral""? Or even ""The Graduate"" to some degree?  Well, ""Wedding Crashers"" certainly plays like these with the minimum of refurbishing:  it is in fact a ""cover"" of these older, successful ""hits"" and so has no soul whatsoever.  Owen Wilson is ""Likeable Guy"";  Rachel McAdam the ""Required Honey.""  It's pretty cliche and you won't find anything deep here.  The ending was particularly weak, but the stereotypes (gay son of senator-father [Christopher Walken] who just paints;  granny who gets drunk and says rude things at the dinner table (she is in fact the granny from ""Wedding Singer"";  bored and faithless mom of senator [played by Jane Seymour for some reason];  animal house sidekick [Vince Vaughn] are far weaker and rather offensive:  these images are actually insulting, glaring references.Vince Vaughn is funny - when you can understand him.  (Is he on speed?  It's very difficult to understand him speaking.)  I haven't the faintest clue what Christopher Walken or Jane seymour are doing in this.  Owen Wilson is mailing it in:  he's not even as likeable as he is in other movies.  Rachel McAdam was asked to smile about 100 times for the movie and she is pretty.

Treasure Secretary daughters Claire (Rachel McAdams)the nice one & so is Jeramy whose going for the other daughter Gloria(Isla Fisher) the wild one.Threw the course of the story there are avoiding not be caught,having a lot of embarrassment moments most of them for Jeremy,falling in love & seeing how crazy can a Treasure Secretary's family can be.This is a very funny film.Very good gags in the weddings & in the home of the Secretary.It has a great montage in the start of different weddings a Jewish,Italian & Indian that show how different the cultures are how everybody experiences the fun.Also the movie has a good cameo by someone that im not going mention who it is.So I don't ruin the surprise.Now to talk abot the DVD.It is going to be released in unrated & rated editions.The

They usually tend to be summer blockbusters and because they make a lot of money and attract record crowds there must be need for them. Go figure.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediating wedding crashers whose chronic hobby is to womanize during women's most vulnerable hours (weddings) is the theme.  The first half hour of this overly long (two hour) movie traces them through many a varied wedding circumstance where they prevaricate their way into people's acceptance, the reward being to bed the most gullible females present.  Weddings have been used ad infinitum as theme parks for humor, some clever (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and others not.  This one falls into the latter category as it takes a premise to extremes then shifts focus in the last half hour in an attempt to redeem itself.There are some talented actors in the cast but few of them are given enough material to justify their inclusion.  Jane Seymour in a Mrs. Robinson role has moments, but Christopher Walken as a government bigwig falters.  A new face, Rachel McAdams, is welcome and acts as the only truly thought out character in the story.

Still, though I will be lying if I said that the Frat Pack is not without good laughs still...it's just getting a little old and predictable.Friends and co-workers John and Jeremy are marriage arbitrators that work hard and reward themselves with the wedding crashing scene. Both have very planned out and effective rules that result in many successful outings. Their game is good, but the ""X"" factor (love) bites one of them as John falls for a politician's daughter and their usual routine turns into a messy and funny situation.

944200,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B000BKVQRU,Harkanwar Anand,"[1, 1]","Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is arguably the biggest hit of it's kind this year. I'm sure there are some better films available out there but this is the kind that gets all the media's attention. Comedy is a genre that lacks depth. Mixing Will Ferrel towards the end of the film was a clever move. Although his short appearance doesnt make you go bonkers with laughter, it was mildly amusing. Wedding Crashers has some great humor and Owne Wilson's stand out performance astonished me. For some reason, this is the best Comedy performance he has given.Do not even look for any ""real"" chemistry between Rachel McAdams(Goodness,she's beautiful) and Owen Wilson's character. The grandmother in the film plays a funny role in being honest. I thought they overdid the slot of the teenage gay artist. Vince Vaughn gives a role worth being acknowledged. It's his fast, unbrash, unabrasive yet loud side that made the crowd roar.Although there is nothing in this film that I disliked, Wedding Crashers is at best, one of the finer three star grade movies you will see. It is definitely funnier than Meet The Fockers which was rather sleep inducing. I wish directors could make more films that are more character oriented and a specific theme to it.2005 had many comedies,most of which fall flat on it's face.

A very funny film that has great scenes, decent acting and is well worth buying.The plot centres around two friends whose life is geared towards crashing weddings so they can score with women. They do this by inventing ridiculous histories and personalities so that the women either feel awed by them or are moved by pity - ""I lost all the men in my unit....it's hard being alone...so hard"". It's very funny to watch all the crazy antics they get up to, although it's not too long before they crash a wedding where a senator and his daughters are attending.This is the main plot of the film as the two friends try to score with the daughters, and then find themselves in trouble from a violent boyfriend, a slightly crazy mother and daughter and many other great characters such as Christopher Walken and the foul-mouthed grandmother. It's well made and is surprisingly touching when both friends start to look at the emptiness of what they're doing and realise they might love the two daughters (beautiful Isla  Fisher and Rachel cook).I can't give many examples of the funny scenes (there are many) because it would ruin the joke, sufice to say if you liked the 40 year old virgin, anchorman, and any of Owen Wilsons films then this is for you.",4,"Great fun film, well made.",1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,1361,"['comedy', 'success', 'same', 'way', '40', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'was', 'alot', 'more', 'hits', 'misses', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'scenes', 'decent', 'acting', 'well', 'worth', 'buying.The', 'plot', 'centres', 'two', 'friends', 'life', 'geared', 'towards', 'crashing', 'weddings', 'can', 'score', 'women', 'do', 'inventing', 'ridiculous', 'histories', 'personalities', 'so', 'women', 'feel', 'awed', 'are', 'moved', 'pity', 'lost', 'men', 'unit', '.it', 'hard', 'being', 'alone', 'so', 'hard', 'very', 'funny', 'watch', 'crazy', 'antics', 'get', 'up', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'crash', 'wedding', 'where', 'senator', 'daughters', 'are', 'attending.This', 'main', 'plot', 'film', 'two', 'friends', 'try', 'score', 'daughters', 'then', 'find', 'trouble', 'violent', 'boyfriend', 'slightly', 'crazy', 'mother', 'daughter', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'characters', 'such', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'foul-mouthed', 'grandmother', 'well', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'when', 'friends', 'start', 'look', 'emptiness', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'realise', 'might', 'love', 'two', 'daughters', 'beautiful', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Rachel', 'cook', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'many', 'examples', 'funny', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'would', 'ruin', 'joke', 'sufice', 'say', 'liked', '40', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'anchorman', 'Owen', 'Wilsons', 'films', 'then']",N/A

944208,A6D6XYJLKQWF4,B000BKVQRU,"Jameson Thottam ""Jameson Thottam""","[0, 2]","Jameson Thottam and Smashing Review for the CrashersWhen I started seeing ads for Wedding Crashers, I had it pegged as the type of thing that's better to see on cable, maybe even in a couple of sittings. A comedy with Vince Vaughan, Owen Wilson, and Will Farrell: probably pretty low-brow, with a couple of genuine laughs and a few more guilty ones. Spinal Tap once said that ""there's a fine line between clever and stupid"" and this crew is unafraid to walk it: Old School, Anchorman...I'll look at those flicks on TV, but I don't want to pay for them. True, Swingers was really good, but that was eight years ago. I wasn't getting my hopes up too much given that recent track record, though I'll admit that the premise--two charming scoundrels nearing middle age crash weddings in search of good times, free booze and easy women, then get captured in their own game--did sound like Comedy Gold.The Reviews Rolled In * Jameson ThottamI became intrigued when the reviews started coming in. The positive reviews described it in terms that I could relate to--the LA Times said something like it hearkened back to the innocent days of the 1970s when a comedy wasn't afraid to push the limits of good taste if the joke was funny enough. Even the naysayers were encouraging, being as most of them sounded humorless, superior and/or prudish in their dismissal. It was like back in the day, when Cheech and Chong got a bad review in the paper--when somebody simply doesn't even get it, who cares what they think? It's their problem and not the movie's.Suspended Disbelief *  James ThottamSo I suspended my disbelief for Wedding Crashers, hoping to like it but prepared to be disappointed just in case. Fortunately, I liked it...I really, really liked it. The chemistry between Vaughan and Wilson is good and believable even in places where the dialog is a little forced, and the female leads Rachael McAdams and Isla Fisher (paired respectively with Vaughan and Wilson) were both very likable and seemed genuine. McAdams' character is more or less straight, while Fisher's role is totally screwball. Fisher steals a few of her scenes by combining equal parts sheer sex appeal and deft slapstick timing. But, then, I would expect no less from the girlfriend (fiance, I think) of Sacha Baron Cohen, aka Ali G.Other Characters *  Jameson L ThottamJane Seymour and Christopher Walken appear in supporting roles and make the most of their somewhat limited screen time. Walken is a fine comedic actor; the little flashes he shows of the unhinged persona that he used to be typecast into really make the whole thing work. And Seymour is a revelation; she is edgily hilarious in her scenes with Wilson. Farrell appears towards the end of the movie; to say his character and his portrayal of him are over the top is to put it mildly, but he made me laugh out loud.Tone and Humour Say it All *  Jameson ThottamI really liked the tone of the film. The humor is outrageous and veers toward some pretty dark territory, never quite going over the edge before steering back into safer ground. It's a light romantic comedy at heart, if a deeply twisted one. The humor is not PC, and those who are easily offended will be. I wasn't, though; the jokes were irreverent but not mean spirited.Let's Be Honest *  Jameson ThottamI'm not saying Wedding Crashers is a perfect film, but on the other hand I'm not going to sit here and nit-pick the thing to death when they got the big stuff right. The plot developed sublimely for this type of picture; it began with a situation that was plausible, but really only just. Each further development made it progressively more absurd, forcing you to stretch your sense of disbelief, but not quite breaking it (though the scenes with Will Farrell really pushed it). That formula worked for the 3 Stooges and the Marx Brothers and it still works today. The script was well-written on the whole, with some very clever dialog--Vaughan's part seemed tailor made for his abilities. Did some things seem a little contrived, like the writers and director were trying to compress a lot of events and backstory into a couple of the scenes? Yeah, but that almost always happens to some degree in every movie. The film moved quickly enough that there wasn't any reason to dwell on it, and the performances were compelling enough to render any of those problems moot.The Finale *  Jameson ThottamSome people have suggested that the ending is a little sweet and out of keeping with the rest of the film. Those people don't get it. Does it have a Hollywood ending? Yeah, you could say that it, but you could also say it goes a lot deeper than that. Comedies end with weddings and tragedies end with death. If we don't give Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde and Shakespeare any crap about that, it seems pretty backward to hold lesser artists to a higher standard. It's a formula that has worked for centuries and I see no need to chuck it out the window. I'd rather see a movie that follows the conventions with good characters and dialog than watch some amateurs try to reinvent the wheel with a bunch of stupid plot twists.""A Feel Good"" Movie *  Jameson ThottamWedding Crashers made me happy. It was a well-crafted movie that was transgressively funny without sinking to the level of simply grossing you out. All the actors were good; after years of underachieving, this picture restored my faith in Vince Vaughan to some extent. I had feared it was going to be another dumb comedy like Anchorman, but it turned out to be a pretty smart comedy which, at least in its best parts, combined the sensibilities of Animal House and Sideways.

So, let's talk about the first half of the movie, or the 4-star part....Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are professional wedding crashers, and they are extremely talented at it, they are sure to get every slightest detail down so no mistake can be made, and for a while everything is going fine, they are eating, drinking and freakin' everything in sight.

The chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson is perfect, as expected, what is this the 4th or 5th movie they've been in together?Eventually, Wilson falls in love, breaking 1 of the some thousand wedding crashing rules, and to top it off, the woman Wilson fell in love with (the lovely Rachel McAdams) is the daughter of Christopher Walken, who just happens to be running for office. To add more crazyness to the plot, Vaughn's character nails another one of the daughters, who in turn falls in love with him. Got all that? Good, moving on....The dialogue between Wilson and Vaughn is very funny, most of the jokes work, and while a bit raunchy here and there, it fits well. Now here's where things start to fall apart, both with the movie and our heroe's.The second part of the movie, or the 2-star part, goes all out on Hollywood cliches' We get the family bickering, the big 'fight' between Wilson and Vaughn, the speech during the wedding , it just seemed forced and that they just ran out of good jokes, so they recycled some old, lamer ones. I saw the ending coming a mile away and the edge and character the movie had is all but gone now.So, I gave 4-stars and 2-stars, another bit of the 4-star part I rather enjoyed are the minor roles played by Jane Seymour, she plays Christopher Walken's drunk wife with new breasts, and Will Ferrell (surprised? nah, me either, I think there is an agreement  with these 3 men along with Ben Stiller to appear in everyone of each other's movies. just a thought) as Chaz, the legendary wedding crasher Vaughn and Wilson are always quoting. He plays a man in his late 30's, still leaving with his mother, now crashing funerals cuz' it's so easy to get laid by a depressed chick, or so Ferrell says.There are many subplots, most I didn't care for, but be sure and check out Vaughn's confession to a preist at the breakfeast table........priceless!!! and Jane Seymour's half-ass attempt at seducing Owen Wilson with her new ta-ta's, very funny!!acting......4 stars, You know you can't go wrong with these twodirecting....3 stars, 30-54 minutes too longspecial effects...N/A, comedy here, not thrills and chillscomedy rating .....4 stars first 70 minutes, 2 stars after thatquality........3.5 stars, Decent picture quality, little grain, but great soundtrack",3,"First 70 minutes are hilarious, then.................",1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,3118,"['movie', 'was', '30-45', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'saw', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'shoved', 'together', 'could', 'succeed', 'getting', 'two', 'hour', 'comedy', 'movie', 'released', 'am', 'firm', 'believer', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'comedy', 'short', '70-85', 'minute', 'range', 'as', 'long', 'funny', 'one', 'was', 'movie', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'going', 'So', 'let', 'talk', 'first', 'half', 'movie', '4-star', 'part', '.Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'professional', 'wedding', 'crashers', 'are', 'extremely', 'talented', 'are', 'sure', 'get', 'slightest', 'detail', 'down', 'so', 'no', 'mistake', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'while', 'everything', 'going', 'fine', 'are', 'eating', 'drinking', 'freakin', 'everything', 'sight', 'while', 'making', '.alot', 'lies', 'facial', 'expressions', 'two', 'come', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'priceless', 'chemistry', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'perfect', 'expected', 'what', '4th', '5th', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'together', 'Eventually', 'Wilson', 'love', 'breaking', '1', 'thousand', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'rules', 'top', 'off', 'woman', 'Wilson', 'fell', 'love', 'lovely', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'daughter', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'running', 'office', 'add', 'more', 'crazyness', 'plot', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'one', 'daughters', 'who', 'turn', 'falls', 'love', 'Got', 'Good', 'moving', '.The', 'dialogue', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'very', 'funny', 'most', 'jokes', 'work', 'bit', 'raunchy', 'here', 'there', 'well', 'Now', 'here', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'movie', ""heroe's.The"", 'second', 'part', 'movie', '2-star', 'part', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'get', 'family', 'bickering', 'big', ""'fight"", 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'speech', 'wedding', 'just', 'seemed', 'forced', 'just', 'ran', 'good', 'jokes', 'recycled', 'old', 'lamer', 'ones', 'saw', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'edge', 'character', 'movie', 'had', 'gone', 'now.So', 'gave', '4-stars', '2-stars', 'bit', '4-star', 'part', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'minor', 'roles', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'drunk', 'wife', 'new', 'breasts', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'surprised', 'nah', 'think', 'agreement', '3', 'men', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'appear', 'everyone', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'thought', 'Chaz', 'legendary', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'are', 'always', 'quoting', 'man', 'late', '30', 'still', 'leaving', 'mother', 'now', 'crashing', 'funerals', 'cuz', 'so', 'easy', 'get', 'laid', 'depressed', 'chick', 'so', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'many', 'subplots', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Vaughn', 'confession', 'preist', 'breakfeast', 'table', '..priceless', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'half-ass', 'attempt', 'seducing', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'new', 'ta-ta', 'very', 'funny', 'acting', '4', 'stars', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'twodirecting', '.3', 'stars', '30-54', 'minutes', 'too', 'longspecial', 'effects', 'N/A', 'comedy', 'here', 'not', 'thrills', 'chillscomedy', 'rating', '..4', 'stars', 'first', '70', 'minutes', '2', 'stars', 'thatquality', '..3.5', 'stars', 'Decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'little', 'grain', 'great', 'soundtrack']",N/A

They are very good at what they do, but are beginning to think they might be getting a little old for the gameAnyone who can't guess that by the end of the film they will have abandoned their wayward ways and found true love should not be allowed to rent or buy this movie.""Wedding Crashers"" is goofy and charming. It's probably one of the best buddy movies of recent years. Vince Vaughn, especially is terrific. It is a relief to know that some actors can still summon up a range of facial expressions. Vaughan runs through expressions with a rapidity and intelligence that was often hard to keep up with. Wilson was adequate, and shone brighter in the glare of Vaughan's over-the-top persona. Together, the two of them captured the hedonistic approach of these overgrown juveniles. They were great together and really came across as the life-long friends they were supposed to be portraying, who (for all their purported selfishness) actually brought life and joy to the weddings they crashed.Kudos to Isla Fisher and Jane Symour, who played the sisters (Gloria and Kathleen Cleary) who got entangled into the boys' scheming. Isla was positively terrifying as the ""clinger"" who latched onto Jeremy. And Seymour played just the right mix of beauty, charm and vulnerability as the girl Wilson wants to rescue from marriage to a lout.The only downside to ""Wedding Crashers"" (and which loses the movie 1 star) is the gratuitous nudity, language and vulgarity that the writers threw in. But the film made me laugh, which is a rarity these days.The DVD version has the usual deleted scenes (lame) and director's commentary, which I did not listen to. It also includes an ""uncorked"" version which is 8-1/2 minutes longer than the original.

Hardly a couple of month's goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released. When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodge ball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com clich&eacute;. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fianc&eacute;e Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film.",4,All works very well for them until they decide to crash the wedding of weddings.,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,1806,"['Frat-Pack', 'are', 'surely', 'hardest', 'working', 'collective', 'Hollywood', 'Hardly', 'couple', 'month', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Wilson', 'boys', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'being', 'released', 'When', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'paired', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'good', 'when', 'Dodge', 'ball', 'put', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'better', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'Frat-Pack', 'pairing', 'date.Although', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'have', 'appeared', 'four', 'movies', 'together', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'where', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'star', 'billing', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'times', 'formulaic', 'comic', 'performances', 'raise', 'movie', 'par', 'lesser', 'hands', 'main', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'descended', 'Rom-Com', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fast-talking', 'machine-gun', 'delivery', 'Vaughn', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'Wilson', 'laconic', 'style', 'single-guy', 'banter', 'often', 'painfully', 'accurate', 'acknowledgement', ""'re"", 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'acting', 'so', 'carelessly', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'comic', 'set-pieces', 'too', 'notably', 'divorce', 'meeting', 'weddings', 'montage', 'cringe-worthy', 'football', 'game', 'hunting', 'trip.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'asset', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'expertly', 'tightrope', 'being', 'broodingly', 'intimidating', 'likable', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', ""'Claire"", 'charming', 'vulnerability', 'easy-to-fall-in', 'love', 'quality', 'Former', 'Home', 'Away', 'pin-up', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'however', 'less', 'convincing.I', 'admit', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'far', 'perfect', 'time', 'situations', 'seem', 'too', 'contrived', 'nudity', 'laughably', 'gratuitous', 'Claire', 'evil', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sack', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'almost', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'device', 'make', 'Wilson', 'look', 'good.But', 'can', 'look', 'simply', 'accept', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'very', 'funny', 'film']",N/A

Owen Wilson as John & Vince Vaughn as Jeremy certainly are. Lots of cameos such as James Carville & John McCain seemingly together in the background of a weddingscene. Jane Seymore has a small part as the horny mother of the bride. I've always liked her, especially topless.John & Jeremy crash weddings. Lots of them. They have it down to a science & take great pride in doing it well, that is without getting caught. They even have a book of rules that are scared & not to be violated. The object? To get laid. There are lots of unattached young ladies who are caught up in the strong romantic emotions that weddings evoke, waiting to be plucked.Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary, played by Christopher Walken, is having a big wedding for one of his daughters & it promises to be the social event of the summer.  John & Jeremy have had a sucessful season & this would be the topper.You may guess what happens. They break the most important rule: Do not fall in love.

Generally, these movies are mostly the same, but occasionally one comes along that stands out from the rest.  Some of these rarities are films such as, ""American Pie"", ""American Pie 2"", ""Van Wilder"", and some would even say ""Old School"" or even ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"", on the last two movies I must disagree, I hated both films.  However, one adult comedy standout of 2005 would have to be the side-splittingly hilarious comedic duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in ""Wedding Crashers"".Guided by an elaborate set of `wedding crashing rules', John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and his best friend, Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), charm their way into most any wedding, with one purpose in mind.  Hook up with some emotionally overcharged single woman, and have one night of sex, then drop them like it never happened.  Some would say this is a guy's dream come true.  Everything is going smoothly for these two `crashers' as the peak of wedding season is upon them, and go figure one of the biggest weddings ever is occurring in their very own city of Washington D.C.  As the U.S. Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken) has announced the wedding of his oldest daughter.  Intent on hooking up with some very rich and powerful, yet still desperate women, John and Jeremy get more than they bargained for as both of them become fixated on the other 2 daughters of the senator.  Jeremy has the misfortune of getting involved with the Secretary's somewhat crazy daughter (Isla Fisher), who after their romantic tryst has become completely obsessed with him.  While John has set his sights on the Secretary's youngest daughter (Rachel McAdams), but instead of having one night of lust, John breaks a sacred `wedding crasher' rule and begins to fall in love.  To prove himself, John drags his buddy Jeremy along to the family's estate for a fun-filled weekend that just may prove to be even too wild for these two professional party guys.The laughs just keep on coming in this movie, as joke after joke will leave you rolling in the aisle.  Though this movie is intended to be a comedy in every sense, there is still plenty of heart and drama to this story.  As the two main characters begin to learn that their chosen hobby is not without consequence, though nothing severe, after all this is still a comedy.  Eventually John and Jeremy realize that wedding crashing though fun, and leaving them with plenty of action, isn't as fulfilling as a meaningful relationship with a person they truly love.  The cast is spectacular and wildly eccentric from Christopher Walken, to Owen Wilson, to Jane Seymour, to Vince Vaughn, there isn't a single casting choice that could even possibly be regretted.If you're in the mood for a laugh-a-minute comedy, and also are not easily offended, then ""Wedding Crashers"" is right up your alley.""Wedding Crashers"" is rated R for language and nudity/sexuality.",5,Hide Your Bridesmaids...,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2955,"['Raunchy', 'sex-filled', 'comedies', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'hot', 'commodity', 'Hollywood', 'Generally', 'movies', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'occasionally', 'one', 'out', 'rest', 'rarities', 'are', 'films', 'such', 'American', 'Pie', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'Old', 'School', 'even', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'must', 'disagree', 'hated', 'films', 'However', 'one', 'adult', 'comedy', 'standout', '2005', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'side-splittingly', 'hilarious', 'comedic', 'duo', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '.Guided', 'elaborate', 'set', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'rules', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'best', 'friend', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'charm', 'way', 'most', 'wedding', 'one', 'purpose', 'mind', 'Hook', 'up', 'emotionally', 'overcharged', 'single', 'woman', 'have', 'one', 'night', 'sex', 'then', 'drop', 'never', 'happened', 'would', 'say', 'guy', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Everything', 'going', 'smoothly', 'two', 'crashers', 'peak', 'wedding', 'season', 'go', 'figure', 'one', 'biggest', 'weddings', 'ever', 'occurring', 'very', 'own', 'city', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'U.S.', 'Secretary', 'Treasury', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'announced', 'wedding', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Intent', 'hooking', 'up', 'very', 'rich', 'powerful', 'yet', 'still', 'desperate', 'women', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'become', 'fixated', 'other', '2', 'daughters', 'senator', 'Jeremy', 'misfortune', 'getting', 'involved', 'Secretary', 'somewhat', 'crazy', 'daughter', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'romantic', 'tryst', 'become', 'completely', 'obsessed', 'John', 'set', 'sights', 'Secretary', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'instead', 'having', 'one', 'night', 'lust', 'John', 'sacred', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'rule', 'fall', 'love', 'prove', 'John', 'buddy', 'Jeremy', 'family', 'estate', 'fun-filled', 'weekend', 'just', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'even', 'too', 'wild', 'two', 'professional', 'party', 'guys.The', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'movie', 'joke', 'joke', 'will', 'leave', 'rolling', 'aisle', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'comedy', 'sense', 'still', 'plenty', 'heart', 'drama', 'story', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'begin', 'learn', 'chosen', 'hobby', 'not', 'consequence', 'nothing', 'severe', 'still', 'comedy', 'Eventually', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'realize', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'fun', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'action', ""n't"", 'as', 'fulfilling', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'person', 'truly', 'love', 'cast', 'spectacular', 'wildly', 'eccentric', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', ""n't"", 'single', 'casting', 'choice', 'could', 'even', 'possibly', 'be', 'regretted.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'laugh-a-minute', 'comedy', 'also', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'then', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'right', 'alley', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'nudity/sexuality']",N/A

944234,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000BKVQRU,Kaya Savas,"[0, 1]","MOVIE: A slight breath of fresh air hits the theaters in the midst of this dull summer in the form of Wedding Crashers.  Basically the title says it all, we have to guys who go to weddings to pick up girls, but at one point Owen Wilson's character has enough and figures that this is childish.  He then falls for a woman who is the daughter of a famous U.S Senator played by Christopher Walken.  Now Owen Wilson is willing to go to the extremes to lie about who he is so that he can try and win over this girl.  He drags Vince Vaughn along for the ride who has been caught by the eye of the senator's other daughter.  The whole movie basically takes place at the senator's summer home by the Chesapeake Bay.  Here ensues some hilarious situations with the great comic talents of the leading actors.  By far the funniest scene in the movie is the dinner scene, which I won't describe because it needs to be seen fresh.  Another funny scene is where Vince Vaughn is tied up by the girl who has fallen for him, she then forces him into sex while he is tied up.  Later the sentor's homosexual son finds him in this vulnerable position and things go from there.  The movie is funny, but unfortunetly relies on physical comedy to keep it moving.  The characters are one dimensiona, and the plot is a cliche of every other romance movie.  The guy who wants the girl, but the girl is with another man, the man is an ass, in the end the guy gets the girl and the ass gets the boot.  It's a very formulaic movie, but it's funny.  Not the funniest movie I have ever seen, but it's funny.ACTING: The acting we get is all physical.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are hilarious in the movie, but the characters they play are not developed well enough in the script for us to care what happens to them.  The audience is just along for the ride.  Christopher Walken plays another funny role, not as funny as other stuff he has done but still funny.BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a great summer comedy with all the right ingredients for a croud pleaser.  At this point it doesn't matter what anybody says about it, because New Line Cinema is up to their ears in money from this one.  It's a road map plot with one dimensional characters, but it is very funny and has a hilarious cameo at the end.",3,A Comedy Much Needed In The Midst Of A Dull Summer Movie Season,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,2273,"['MOVIE', 'slight', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'theaters', 'midst', 'dull', 'summer', 'form', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Basically', 'title', 'have', 'guys', 'who', 'go', 'weddings', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'one', 'point', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'enough', 'childish', 'then', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'famous', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Now', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'willing', 'go', 'extremes', 'lie', 'who', 'so', 'can', 'try', 'win', 'girl', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'ride', 'who', 'been', 'caught', 'eye', 'senator', 'other', 'daughter', 'whole', 'movie', 'basically', 'place', 'senator', 'summer', 'home', 'Chesapeake', 'Bay', 'Here', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'great', 'comic', 'talents', 'leading', 'actors', 'far', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie', 'dinner', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'be', 'seen', 'fresh', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'tied', 'up', 'girl', 'who', 'fallen', 'then', 'sex', 'tied', 'up', 'Later', 'sentor', 'homosexual', 'son', 'vulnerable', 'position', 'things', 'go', 'there', 'movie', 'funny', 'unfortunetly', 'physical', 'comedy', 'keep', 'moving', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensiona', 'plot', 'cliche', 'other', 'romance', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'girl', 'man', 'man', 'ass', 'end', 'guy', 'girl', 'ass', 'boot', 'very', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'funny', 'Not', 'funniest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'funny.ACTING', 'acting', 'get', 'physical', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'well', 'enough', 'script', 'care', 'what', 'audience', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'funny', 'role', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'other', 'stuff', 'done', 'still', 'funny.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'movie', 'great', 'summer', 'comedy', 'right', 'ingredients', 'croud', 'pleaser', 'point', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'anybody', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'ears', 'money', 'one', 'road', 'map', 'plot', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'very', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'end']",N/A

944237,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000BKVQRU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","""Wedding Crashers"" is a very funny film.  It's got more laughs and potty humor in it than you can shake a stick at.  It's almost perfect, but there's one flaw.  It tries too hard to appeal to both men and women at the same time.  It takes raunchy fun and tries to couple it with a romantic comedy.  The two genres rarely mix well.  Considering this, though, the film is worth multiple views.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two buddies out for a little tail.  In order to achieve said goal, they crash weddings and go after just about every lady in the joint that isn't a bride.  They charm old folks and amuse the youngsters in an attempt to grab the eyes(and hopefully the panties) of some young woman in the crowd.  They do all of this by a set of rules set by the original wedding crasher, who we run into at the end of the film.Christopher Walken plays the father of Rachel McAdams in this film.  Owen Wilson's character falls for her when he grows tired of chasing women all of the time.  His buddy, played superbly by Vince Vaughn, has to take on McAdams' sister, played by Isla Fisher.  Fisher almost single-handedly steals the show as the psychotic, sex-crazed nympho who literally takes down Vaughn.  The ever lovely Jane Seymour plays Walken's wife, and the rest of the offbeat family is wonderfully acted out.  I won't give away the identity of the actor playing the original wedding crasher, but I will say that his performance was a bit too much at times.  He's funny at first, but much like Stiffler in the ""American Pie"" films, he begins to be annoying after awhile.If you enjoy gut-laughter, this film is for you.  It runs a tad bit long, especially with the romance between Wilson and McAdams.  However, when the laughs start, they hang around for quite some time.I've noticed how some reviewers find this film to be offensive and degrading to women.  Grow up!  If you can't handle flicks like this that want to have FUN, then you should know better than to watch this type of film.  If you think this flick is degrading to women, I suggest ""The Sweetest Thing,"" with Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate.  In it, the boys get the shaft instead of the stereotypical chicks in ""Wedding Crashers.""Had ""Crashers"" stuck with the buddy concept and made this a ""guy movie,"" I'd have given it five stars.  However, with the romance taking up a little too much time, I'm forced to give it a four.  We need more ""guy movies"" these days.  People are so hung up on being politically correct that we're risking the ruin of the adult comedy.  Thanks to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson for taking a chance with this comedy.  It's well worth purchasing.",4,Almost Laugh-A-Minute,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2653,"['Wedding', 'Crashers', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'got', 'more', 'laughs', 'potty', 'humor', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'almost', 'perfect', 'one', 'flaw', 'too', 'hard', 'appeal', 'men', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'raunchy', 'fun', 'tries', 'couple', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'genres', 'rarely', 'mix', 'well', 'Considering', 'though', 'film', 'worth', 'multiple', 'views.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'are', 'two', 'buddies', 'little', 'tail', 'order', 'achieve', 'said', 'goal', 'crash', 'weddings', 'go', 'just', 'lady', 'joint', ""n't"", 'bride', 'charm', 'old', 'folks', 'amuse', 'youngsters', 'attempt', 'grab', 'eyes', 'hopefully', 'panties', 'young', 'woman', 'crowd', 'do', 'set', 'rules', 'set', 'original', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'who', 'run', 'end', 'film.Christopher', 'Walken', 'father', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'film', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'when', 'tired', 'chasing', 'women', 'time', 'buddy', 'played', 'superbly', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'take', 'McAdams', 'sister', 'played', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'Fisher', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'show', 'psychotic', 'sex-crazed', 'nympho', 'who', 'literally', 'down', 'Vaughn', 'ever', 'lovely', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Walken', 'wife', 'rest', 'offbeat', 'family', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'identity', 'actor', 'playing', 'original', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'will', 'say', 'performance', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'funny', 'first', 'much', 'Stiffler', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'be', 'annoying', 'awhile.If', 'enjoy', 'gut-laughter', 'film', 'tad', 'bit', 'long', 'especially', 'romance', 'Wilson', 'McAdams', 'However', 'when', 'laughs', 'start', 'hang', 'quite', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'how', 'reviewers', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'offensive', 'degrading', 'women', 'Grow', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'flicks', 'want', 'have', 'FUN', 'then', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'watch', 'type', 'film', 'think', 'flick', 'degrading', 'women', 'suggest', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'boys', 'get', 'shaft', 'instead', 'stereotypical', 'chicks', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Had', 'Crashers', 'stuck', 'buddy', 'concept', 'made', 'guy', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'romance', 'taking', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', ""'m"", 'forced', 'give', 'four', 'need', 'more', 'guy', 'movies', 'days', 'People', 'are', 'so', 'hung', 'up', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', ""'re"", 'risking', 'ruin', 'adult', 'comedy', 'Thanks', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'taking', 'chance', 'comedy', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing']",N/A
944238,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BKVQRU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 0]","Smitten by love, a conceptually romantic idea, eventually guides many couples to the altar where they promise each other an everlasting union until death do them part.  The truth, on the other hand, reveals a much different picture whereas one out of two marriages from the 1990s have already faced divorce.  This means that honor and integrity in regards to the wedding vows does not seem to be a priority among many divorc&eacute;es.  Divorces are also painful experiences where the splitting party must dig up the old affairs to settle who gets what.  In this emotional mess, lawyers often become meddlers for each party.  In the middle of these difficult divorce intricacies John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vince Vaughn), two divorce consultants with an expertise in human interaction and relationships, work in a booming business nourishing on many broken hearts.Marriage is something ancient and best buried, or at least that is how John and Jeremy see the matrimonial commitment that marriage brings.  Thus, it is with a heavy dose of irony that these two take ecstatic pleasure in weddings.  They approach wedding ceremonies like a colossal smorgasbord of consensual women during the peak season of weddings, a season they celebrate, as the wedding season.  The wedding season for John and Jeremy is what Christmas is to kids, or hunting season is for a hunter, as they set out to conquer women.  For the simple reason of getting women into bed the two 30-something divorce consultants crash weddings, which they do in a deceitful and manipulative manner in order to unlock the heart of women with reckless abandon.A funny analogy can be drawn from the two best friends, John and Jeremy, who work with other's misery like vultures sitting on a desert telephone pole waiting for their prey to die when they crash weddings.  Yet, they are social chameleons that easily mingle and make friends with their fake identities based on extensive research.  All of the befriending and manipulating has one ultimate goal to achieve a brief moment of physical pleasure.  This suggests that John and Jeremy never have experienced strong affections for someone more than the moment of love making.  Thus, these two mutate into a crossing between scavenging vultures and unfeeling reptiles while deceiving the wedding guests with their charismatic charm in order to successfully achieve their quest for gullible women.In one scene, John briefly questions the moral meaning of what they are doing, which Jeremy rationalizes to the point where doubt no longer is present.  Nonetheless, the notion of deceitfulness remains within the audience while the story trots along.  After the lengthy introduction where the main characters crash several weddings, the official story begins when they crash a sophisticated upper-class wedding held for the politically influential Secretary of Treasury Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter.  At the wedding John encounters something for the first time that he has a hard time expressing for his friend Jeremy.  His eyes fall on the maid of honor Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), and from that moment on it is evident that John has fallen in love.  Jeremy is not as lucky at the wedding, as he gets himself into a heap of trouble with a slightly disturbed girl that will provide much belly-aching laughter.After the wedding, John and Jeremy are invited to the Cleary's where they are introduced to a rather eccentric family on many levels.  Rachel McAdams' character, Claire, whom John has fallen in love with seems to be the only character that comes across like a caricatature.  This occurs while the rest of the family might qualify for a wide range of psychological disorders.  For example, her fianc&eacute;e is a relentless Ivy League alpha male with psychopathic tendencies and her nasty homophobic grandmother openly assaults her own grandson in the presence of others.  It is a unique family environment in which John tries to win over Claire, by being himself, which is something new for him.  This will naturally set up some obstacles for John, but with the help of an agonized Jeremy he might succeed.Wedding Crashers is a candid and fun loving comedy that reaches deep within the society to pull out a wide range of expressions for love through a large number of characters.  The exaggerated characters shed light on contemporary issues that relate to love.  At times, it feels as if Puck (character from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) would jump out, which is a sign that this is a solid comedy with a little seriousness and cheerfulness.  This takes place as the story actually brings out some of the true qualities of human beings that often are tabooed, or neglected.  The director David Dobkin freely throws in a large number of sexual jokes in the film, as sex is a natural part of a marriage and love between a loving couple.  Thus, some scenes will likely offend some while many will find it difficult not to laugh.  In essence, Dobkin pokes at love through a wide spectrum of societal values while maintaining the strength of ambiguity that travels with the phenomenon of love.",4,Candidly Hysterical Comedy with a

Secondly, it's very funny.  It crude, rude, and hysterical.  The only negative comments I have is that it should have been even funnier.  There were three distinct instances in which the movie could have made more fun of its initial premise.  The actual act of crashing weddings to pick up women is almost completely spent by the time the opening credits are finished.

Also, they  are not above pulling out fake purple hearts to get free drinks or lying about being veterans or dancing with grandmas or children to score points with the girls.  While crashing a wedding, one of the guys hooks up with the psycho daughter of a politician and the other falls in love with the same politician's other daughter.

944250,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BKVQRU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","""Wedding Crashers"" starts off gathering a lot of momentum.  When we first meet them John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are helping the Kroegers (Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca De Mornay) work out the final division of property for their divorce.  The two are snipping at each other until Jeremy begins speaking rapturously about how great weddings are, which serves not only to take the Kroegers down memory lane to a place much happier than getting a divorce but also sets up the coming montage in which we see the ""Wedding Crashers"" in action.  We understand that the whole point of crashing weddings is for the guys to pick up women, but it is also clear that these two are the life of whatever wedding they show up to, whether the happy couple are Jewish, Chinese, or whatever.  There is, if the truth be told, a lot to be said for faking sincerity.As we are dragged alone through this introduction to the boys, we start to learn about ""the Rules"" of crashing weddings: (1) Whatever it takes to get in, get in, (2) Never use your real identity, (3) You're always from out of town, (4) Walk in as if you own the joint, (5) Blend in by sticking out, etc.  Actually the rules do not pop up numerically and sometimes it is clear that John and Jeremy are just saying things and tacking on numbers after the fact to make them rules.  But while the whole idea of having a set of sure fire rules for not only successfully crashing a wedding but also picking up girls at the crashed wedding and protecting your fellow wedding crasher, the script by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher decides to take the boys off of the map.  The eldest daughter of William Clearly (Christopher Walken), the U.S. Treasury Secretary, is getting married and since getting in would be pulling off the mother of all wedding crashes, the boys do their homework (not enough as it would seem) and crash the wedding.But at the wedding John finds himself falling for one of the bride's sisters, Claire (Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy finds the third sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher), has become attached to him in more ways than one.  The former becomes the film's serious relationship while the latter becomes the comic one, and while Jeremy has to deal with the complication of Gloria being both a ""virgin"" and a ""stalker,"" John has to contend with Claire having a long-term boyfriend (Bradley Cooper).  This results in John and Jeremy being invited back to the Clearly compound after the wedding, which is major mistake since this clearly violates several key rules expressly designed to save the wedding crasher from crashing and burning.  John has some initial success in keeping all of his plates in the air spinning, but you can see disaster coming, coming around the bend, especially when the boyfriend gets suspicious about the two unexpected guests.The Clearlys are a strange family.  The father is played by Christopher Walken (enough said), while the mother, played by Jane Seymour, stopped being faithful two years into her marriage and has designs for Jack.  Meanwhile, Jeremy has to worry not only about Gloria, but her brother Todd (Keir O'Donnell), for reasons that become painfully obvious.  Then there is the fact that Clarie's boyfriend plays touch football like it is a grudge match in rugby.  Oh, and did I mention that the nicest thing Grandma Clearly (Ellen Albertini Dow) has to say at the dinner table is that Eleanor Roosevelt looked like a dyke?  This is a strange bunch of people and my basic problem with this film is that Claire does not fit in.  This is a woman who cannot keep a straight face during the wedding because the bride and groom are working in god awful sailing metaphors into their wedding vows, but has been dating her boyfriend for over three years without noticing he is a condescending jerk (when he is at his best).  Forget about falling for a wedding crasher, she needs to ditch this guy regardless of what else is happening in the universe.Fortunately there are enough funny bits in the movie and the decidedly different comic performances by Owen and Vaugh to make it worth watching, although in the end I find myself rounding up not because John learns valuable lessons about love and stuff, but because Jeremy does in a comic twist that actually plays better than the serious relationship the story is trying to spawn between John and Claire.  Unfortunately none of what is going on really sets up the film's final joke, which is too bad because it affirms what I got out of the opening sequences of the film where these guys really like weddings apart from the picking up girls and scoring part.  Most of this two hour movie takes place when there is not a wedding going on, which might be the best indication of where it goes wrong.  ""Wedding Crashers"" is one of those movies where when it is done I think, good first draft of the script and start coming up with ideas to make it better.",4,The first rule of being a wedding crasher should be to follow your own rules,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,4917,"['Wedding', 'Crashers', 'gathering', 'lot', 'momentum', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'are', 'helping', 'Kroegers', 'Dwight', 'Yoakum', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'work', 'final', 'division', 'property', 'divorce', 'two', 'are', 'snipping', 'other', 'Jeremy', 'speaking', 'rapturously', 'how', 'great', 'weddings', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'Kroegers', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'place', 'much', 'happier', 'getting', 'divorce', 'also', 'up', 'coming', 'montage', 'see', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'action', 'understand', 'whole', 'point', 'crashing', 'weddings', 'guys', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'also', 'clear', 'two', 'are', 'life', 'wedding', 'show', 'up', 'happy', 'couple', 'are', 'Jewish', 'Chinese', 'whatever', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'faking', 'sincerity.As', 'are', 'dragged', 'alone', 'introduction', 'boys', 'start', 'learn', 'Rules', 'crashing', 'weddings', '1', 'get', 'get', '2', 'Never', 'use', 'real', 'identity', '3', ""'re"", 'always', 'town', '4', 'Walk', 'own', 'joint', '5', 'Blend', 'sticking', 'out', 'etc', 'Actually', 'rules', 'do', 'not', 'pop', 'up', 'numerically', 'sometimes', 'clear', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'just', 'saying', 'things', 'tacking', 'numbers', 'fact', 'make', 'rules', 'whole', 'idea', 'having', 'set', 'sure', 'fire', 'rules', 'not', 'only', 'successfully', 'crashing', 'wedding', 'also', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'crashed', 'wedding', 'protecting', 'fellow', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'script', 'Steve', 'Faber', 'Bob', 'Fisher', 'take', 'boys', 'map', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'William', 'Clearly', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'U.S.', 'Treasury', 'Secretary', 'getting', 'married', 'getting', 'would', 'be', 'pulling', 'off', 'mother', 'wedding', 'crashes', 'boys', 'do', 'homework', 'not', 'enough', 'would', 'seem', 'wedding.But', 'wedding', 'John', 'falling', 'one', 'bride', 'sisters', 'Claire', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Jeremy', 'third', 'sister', 'Gloria', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'become', 'attached', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'former', 'film', 'serious', 'relationship', 'latter', 'comic', 'one', 'Jeremy', 'deal', 'complication', 'Gloria', 'being', 'virgin', 'stalker', 'John', 'contend', 'Claire', 'having', 'long-term', 'boyfriend', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'results', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'being', 'invited', 'back', 'Clearly', 'compound', 'wedding', 'major', 'mistake', 'clearly', 'several', 'key', 'rules', 'expressly', 'designed', 'save', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'crashing', 'burning', 'John', 'initial', 'success', 'keeping', 'plates', 'air', 'spinning', 'can', 'see', 'disaster', 'coming', 'coming', 'bend', 'especially', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'suspicious', 'two', 'unexpected', 'guests.The', 'Clearlys', 'are', 'strange', 'family', 'father', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'enough', 'said', 'mother', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'stopped', 'being', 'faithful', 'two', 'years', 'marriage', 'designs', 'Jack', 'Meanwhile', 'Jeremy', 'worry', 'not', 'only', 'Gloria', 'brother', 'Todd', 'Keir', ""O'Donnell"", 'reasons', 'become', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Then', 'fact', 'Clarie', 'boyfriend', 'touch', 'football', 'grudge', 'match', 'rugby', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'nicest', 'thing', 'Grandma', 'Clearly', 'Ellen', 'Albertini', 'Dow', 'say', 'dinner', 'table', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'looked', 'dyke', 'strange', 'bunch', 'people', 'basic', 'problem', 'film', 'Claire', 'not', 'fit', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'wedding', 'bride', 'groom', 'are', 'working', 'god', 'awful', 'sailing', 'metaphors', 'wedding', 'vows', 'been', 'dating', 'boyfriend', 'three', 'years', 'noticing', 'condescending', 'jerk', 'when', 'best', 'Forget', 'falling', 'wedding', 'crasher', 'ditch', 'guy', 'regardless', 'what', 'else', 'happening', 'universe.Fortunately', 'are', 'enough', 'funny', 'bits', 'movie', 'decidedly', 'different', 'comic', 'performances', 'Owen', 'Vaugh', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'end', 'find', 'rounding', 'up', 'not', 'John', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'love', 'stuff', 'Jeremy', 'comic', 'twist', 'actually', 'better', 'serious', 'relationship', 'story', 'trying', 'spawn', 'John', 'Claire', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'what', 'going', 'really', 'up', 'film', 'final', 'joke', 'too', 'bad', 'what', 'got', 'out', 'opening', 'sequences', 'film', 'where', 'guys', 'really', 'weddings', 'apart', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'scoring', 'part', 'Most', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'place', 'when', 'not', 'wedding', 'going', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'indication', 'where', 'wrong', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'when', 'done', 'think', 'good', 'first', 'draft', 'script', 'start', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'make', 'better']",N/A

The biggest negative it had going for it, was what happens to all great movies - and that is TV commercials and movie commercials showing all the best and most funny parts ahead of time.  When you get to the cinema or see the dvd, nothing is funny anymore.  I didn't laugh much outside of all the good parts because they had been hashed on tv over and over.  That being said, I did laugh once or twice else and those parts were due to Will Farrell.  He's hillarious and has a cute cameo in this.  I thought overall that Vince Vaughn stole the movie.  He was terrific and so funny.  He had the worst luck throughout the movie, whether it be a hand job under the table with the girl he can't stand to be around, or the brother of said girl entering his bedroom and bed.  Owen Wilson was great too, also having his share of bad luck.  Imagine the mother of the girl you like, exposing herself to you.  He handled himself well under the pressure.  I did expect more from Christopher Walken; I thought he wasn't half as good as many of his other roles and didn't have any great lines or scenes.

I just saw it on HBO, and while I would have to say it's not quite that good, it is a very funny movie.The concept itself is funny--two extroverted and wacky lawyers crashing weddings which they see as the perfect venue for picking up women. And it works like a charm, until a minister played by Henry Gibson finks on them (who I hadn't seen in almost 40 years from Rolin and Martin's Laugh-In, and amazingly, he looks exactly the same except for the white hair).They finally take their womanizing game into the big leagues when they crash the U.S. treasury secretary's party, played by Christopher Walken, who isn't amused by their antics, not to mention his daughter, who likes Owen Wilson. But this time he's really serious about the relationship and Wilson has to convince Walken's daughter that he isn't a lying, two-timing cad--which he has been, at least up to this point-- but now he wants to reform in order to convince the daughter that she isn't just another one-night stand.There are some very funny scenes in the movie, and it isn't all fun and games for the Wilson and Vaughn characters, as Walken has a punch- happy and aggressive in-law who tackles Vince Vaughn and Wilson too hard at a friendly football game on the grass at Walken's mansion, and then later he beats up on Wilson when he finds out about their wedding scam.The other funny thing is when Wilson and Vaughn look up an old womanizer friend, who has found that crashing funerals is an even better way to pick up on women. They thought they were morally shaky ground but they can't hold a candle to this guy, who if anything is even more successful playing the pickup game with his funeral strategy.So overall a decent flick, with enough laughs and funny scenes to be worth a rental on a slow night.

I finally got to see the ""Uncorked Edition"" on DVD - I got what I figured I had missed out on... this movie is hilarious.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great together and they play off of one another classically.  From the opening scene, to the wedding crashing montage, to the ultimate wedding crashing experience at the home of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), these two keep the laughs going.  Vince Vaughn paces the scenes with his rapid-fire fast-wittedness - and Owen Wilson is right there with him.I thought Christopher Walken would have had a funnier part to play and more to contribute.  He is certainly capable of delivering, had he been called on to do so, yet he was good in the role and did what he could with what he was granted.Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher play the two interests of our main characters.  Fisher plays a sex-crazed stalker-type and McAdams plays the sweet, reserved one.  They both play solid supporting roles, but I feel the best supporting role was perhaps one of the smallest: Will Ferrell, in his guest spot, steals the show toward the end of the movie...Bonus featured include a very funny commentary by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, deleted scenes, a few good featurettes, a music video and trailers.

944274,A17AXYVF2995J3,B000BKVQRU,Media Mike,"[1, 2]","I was hoping for something special with this.  This movie boasts both a great cast and great setup.  Two 30-something attorneys still holding on to an ""Animal House"" lifestyle?...oh yeah, Wilson and Vaughn fit the roles perfectly. The supporting cast includes the appealing Rachel McAdams, and the always-great Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour.The movie itself is marketed as a comedy cut from the cloth of Animal House.  And when it keeps that focus...showing the two main characters as personable rogues, the movie works.  Everything seems to be in place: Plentiful schemes and partying by our heroes? Check.  One great grandiose scam underway? Check. Detestable rival for our heroes? Check.There are problems however.  The movie suffers from bad timing and editing.  It also takes itself way too seriously.  The timing suffers because while there are some great setups, the payoffs aren't there.  Here's an example--while Vaughn is staying at his latest girlfriend's family house, events run out of control to the point that he becomes unwillingly bound to the guest bed. The big payoff is when her dad comes in the room, but the scene just ends.  Dad seems to notice the ropes holding Vaughn into place...but there's no real reaction.The movie is overlong and needed some major editing when the story returns from the visit to the family house.  It's pretty easy to guess how the movie will end even halfway through it, so scene after scene of plot development isn't really needed.  Likewise, the cameo towards the end was funny, but could have been handled in a single scene rather than dragging on to multiple events and locations.Finally, the movie treats itself way too seriously.  I don't have a problem with a ""deeper"" moments, or a plot where our heroes see the errors of their ways.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John and Jeremy, best friends who crash weddings for fun in an attempt to get vulnerable girls into bed with them. All goes well until they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Jeremy unknowingly deflowers the Secretary's virginal/sex maniac daughter (Isla Fisher), while poor John falls in love with the Secretary's other daughter (Rachel McAdams), who unfortunately has an asinine boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). The film does lose a bit of momentum halfway through, but it still contains plenty of laughs.

With that said, when I watch movies, I tend to revolve more toward the movies with ""substance"" as opposed to some comic book hero movies,some horror movies, and etc. However, I also enjoy the occasional comedy.  WEDDING CRASHERS isn't the perfect movie, but it is definitely well done for the most part. It is a comedy movie that has a very nice storyline overall as well as a very nice ending. There are some extremely funny moments and some extremely silly, absurd moments. One thing for sure is that WEDDING CRASHERS will keep you laughing.As I stated prior, the storyline is very well done. However, ultimately in the big scheme of things, the whole concept of the movie is absurd. Wedding crashers? Maybe the better terminology would be to say that for the most part the idea of wedding crashers is unrealistic.  Yet, this is a comedy movie and part of the draw of a comedy film is some unbelievable stuff.A quick synopsis of this film is there are two friends who love to attend weddings and pretend to be part of the wedding party's family/friends. These two are played by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn and their ultimate motivation for being ""wedding crashers"" is to seduce women and lets be blunt have sex with them.  The two bad boys attend a high profile wedding for a senator's daughter (or some high position of power) and both Wilson and Vaughn fall in love with the senator's younger daughters.  The daughter than Wilson is in love with is engaged to a man that turns out to be bad and tries to rid of Wilson anyway he can, eventually revealing Wilson and Vaughn's ""wedding crashing"" scheme.  Not to give all away, I will say that everything is resolved correctly at the conclusion of the movie.Through the basic story line, comedy unfurls everywhere through out this ""college boy"" style movie. As I said before, it isn't perfect, nor is it a masterpiece, yet it is better than your average comedy. If compared to THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, The 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN does trump it, but this movie is worth a watch at the very least.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an exceptionally good comic pairing and they make the most of their roles as the titular characters.

Things change though when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary, and find themselves getting too involved with their prey.  Vaughn gets snared by the secretary's sex-crazed youngest daughter and Wilson falls head over heels in love with his other daughter, who just happens to have a hulking jock for a boyfriend.  Not to mention the secretary's alcoholic nympho wife and his artistic and strange son, who may or may not be gay.

944284,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000BKVQRU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 3]","When I first saw the advertisement for Wedding Crashers, I thought it was a typical frat boy romp, involving two older men who should know better going after all the tasty young things that are grieving over their bleak futures at weddings.  It's the perfect plan.But the movie advertised in the trailers is very different from the actual film. Wedding Crashers is actually a sappy love story, complete with theories about true love and the harsh reality that two guys who cruise weddings for chicks are a little pathetic. Depending on your perspective, this is actually a good thing (the movie brings something different to a tired genre) or a bad thing (it is not all about drunk girls getting naked).Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) are best friends forever.  So much so that the night of John's parents' death, Jeremy sleeps over to keep him company.  Aren't they sweet?  They are also high-powered lawyers, arbitrating nasty divorces.  They'd be quite the catch...if it weren't for the fact that these two guys crash weddings. Their jobs help convey why they're so cynical about weddings and also how they can charm their way through just about anything. That all changes when they meet the Clearys.The Clearys are a high-powered political family.  Heading the brood of faux-Kennedys is the patriarch (Christopher Walken), his boozing, horny wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour), his gay son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), grandma (Ellen Albertini, who was also in the Wedding Singer and still going strong!), and his three daughters: dutiful Christina (Jennifer Alden), smart and sassy Claire (the delightful Rachel McAdams), and raunchy Gloria (Isla Fisher, in full-blown nut-job mode).  John meets Claire at Christina's wedding and immediately falls in love.  There's just one problem...she's engaged. Of course.And the guy she's engaged to is Zach ""The Sack"" Lodge (Bradley Cooper), a hyper-masculine jock who likes to beat people up.  Zach is a complete cad and it's up to John, with a little help from Jeremy, to beat the bad guy, get the girl, and live happily ever after.  Somewhere in the middle of all this, Jeremy hooks up with the crazy Gloria and decides she's perfect for him, an ironic twist for the sidekick.Wedding Crashers is wildly uneven, but most of the time you don't mind.  Vaughn can be too kinetic, Wilson can be too sedate, and Fisher is so overbearing that she starts to annoy the audience.  McAdams, however, lights up the screen with her shy smile.  Her magnetic personality even excuses Wilson's incessant mooning over her.  And of course, Walken is hilarious whenever he's on screen.That said, the movie is way too long.  As a sappy romance that starts out as a frat boy comedy, it swings wildly from one genre to the next.  Things take a turn for the worse when Chazz Reinhold (Will Ferrell) shows up, but maybe that's on purpose.  Chazz's appearance heralds John's awakening that crashing weddings is really lame, and by that time I felt the same way.  Fortunately, the movie wraps up shortly after the Anchorman's arrival.Wedding Crashers is one of those sneaky movies that is much more clever in concept than it is in practice.  Fooling men (who only see the trailers and figure it's a comedy) and women (who talk to each other about the movie and thus know what it's actually about) into seeing the same film is a stroke of pure genius.

They go the the weddings, pretending to be distant relatives of the bride or groom, and soon are partying away at the reception.  Of course the ultimate goal is to hook up with a woman, and they do.  Over and over again.After the season is over, they are presented with a bonus round.  The oldest daughter of William Cleary (Walken), Secretary of the Treasury is getting married.  They are successful, and soon John finds himself falling for the bride's sister Claire (McAdams).  On the down side, Jeremy finds himself stalked by the other sister, Gloria (Fisher).  When the secretary takes a liking to the boys, he invites them to a private party for the weekend.  John is excited, Jeremy is not, and soon both meet Claire's fiancee Sack (Cooper).""Wedding Crashers"" is a funny movie.  Wilson and Vaughn have the buddy vibe going, and their interactions all seem genuine.  They both have their moments to shine, but Vince Vaughn really cranks it up a notch as he tries to avoid Gloria and the gay brother.

The boys take a preticular wedding as they crash the wedding of big shot Christopher Walken (upcoming Domino, The Prophecy). There, Wilson meets Claire, played by Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) and falls madly in love with her but the only thing is, is that she is engaged to pompous jackass played by Bradley Cooper (Tv's ALIAS) and on the other line, Vaughn gets involved with McAdams sister who is a real horn dog.

By their own admission, ""wedding season"" is better than Christmas. The opening montage sets the stage, as they crash five weddings of varying religious denominations. Right off the bat, you get the sense that they do this not just for the free food and the strategically beneficial female-to-male ratios, but because they genuinely love being there, meeting new people and in some over-arching sense, being part of the entertainment.Whether it's dancing with the flower girl, offering toasts in the native language, or making balloon animals for the kids (all of which can be found in the ""Rules of Wedding Crashing""), you get a sense that they almost earn their free admission.As events lead to the big wedding-to-be-crashed, you can see for miles ahead where this film is going. You can in most comedies. But the way this film gets there is constantly surprising and entertaining.And funny. Funny funny funny.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a terrific combo. They take their caricatured personas and humanize them. Wilson, the de facto romantic lead, has never been more appealing, with his laconic delivery and winning smile. Vaughn is the perfect counterpoint, with his hysterical verbal diarrhea being the source of countless classic lines. It's not that he can't stop talking...you don't want him to. And you get the feeling that the characters responding to him in the film don't want him to either.Rachel McAdams, last year's It girl, radiates intelligence as well as a totally approachable beauty.Christopher Walken does Christopher Walken and it works. You imagine people going behind his back, saying ""Doesn't the Treasury Secretary remind you of Christopher Walken?""Jane Seymour has few moments, and tries to make the most of them. There will be one scene that most everyone will remember, and deservedly so. She plays with our preconceptions of ""Jane Seymour"" and she uses it to be funny.Bradley Cooper erases his ""Alias"" image as a supreme bastard.The poorly kept secret cameo near the end of the film was a hoot.But for me, the dizzying delight of the film was the outright lunacy of Isla Fisher, playing the ""level 5 virgin clinger"" Gloria. Every scene she's in, she gives off manic fireworks. There's the dinner table scene where she's...well...she's ""playing"" with Vince Vaughn. If you tear your eyes away from Vaughn's uproarious mugging, you'll see a crazed nymphet clearly teetering on the edge of psychosis. Gleefully so.The technical details of the film and the DVD are all fine. The supplements are enough to whet your appetite after the film, and by all means, sample some of the audio commentary by Vaughn and Wilson.As I understand it, the Unrated version offers a few more breasts, and some extension of ""goth"" brother's scenes.""Wedding Crashers"" is a great way to laugh for two hours!",5,The return of the great R-rated comedy!,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,3266,"['Yes', 'consider', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'once', 'while', 'like', 'laugh', 'movie', 'breast', 'flashed', 'curse', 'word', 'uttered.In', 'recent', 'years', 'PG-13-ification', 'film', 'comedies', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'decent', 'smart', 'fun', 'R-rated', 'laugh', 'riot.I', 'take', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'Something', 'Mary', 'R-rated', 'Anyways', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'giddy', 'giggling', 'comedy', 'two', 'buds', 'who', 'crash', 'weddings', 'enthusiasm', 'aplomb', 'own', 'admission', 'wedding', 'season', 'better', 'Christmas', 'opening', 'montage', 'stage', 'crash', 'five', 'weddings', 'varying', 'religious', 'denominations', 'Right', 'bat', 'get', 'sense', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'free', 'food', 'strategically', 'beneficial', 'female-to-male', 'ratios', 'genuinely', 'love', 'being', 'there', 'meeting', 'new', 'people', 'over-arching', 'sense', 'being', 'part', 'entertainment.Whether', 'dancing', 'flower', 'girl', 'offering', 'toasts', 'native', 'language', 'making', 'balloon', 'animals', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Rules', 'Wedding', 'Crashing', 'get', 'sense', 'almost', 'earn', 'free', 'admission.As', 'events', 'lead', 'big', 'wedding-to-be-crashed', 'can', 'see', 'miles', 'ahead', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'can', 'most', 'comedies', 'way', 'film', 'constantly', 'surprising', 'entertaining.And', 'funny', 'Funny', 'funny', 'funny.Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'make', 'terrific', 'combo', 'take', 'caricatured', 'personas', 'humanize', 'Wilson', 'de', 'facto', 'romantic', 'lead', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'appealing', 'laconic', 'delivery', 'winning', 'smile', 'Vaughn', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'hysterical', 'verbal', 'diarrhea', 'being', 'source', 'countless', 'classic', 'lines', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'feeling', 'characters', 'responding', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'either.Rachel', 'McAdams', 'last', 'year', 'intelligence', 'as', 'well', 'totally', 'approachable', 'beauty.Christopher', 'Walken', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'imagine', 'people', 'going', 'back', 'saying', ""n't"", 'Treasury', 'Secretary', 'remind', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'few', 'moments', 'tries', 'make', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'scene', 'most', 'everyone', 'will', 'remember', 'deservedly', 'so', 'preconceptions', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'be', 'funny.Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Alias', 'image', 'supreme', 'bastard.The', 'poorly', 'kept', 'secret', 'cameo', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'hoot.But', 'dizzying', 'delight', 'film', 'was', 'outright', 'lunacy', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'playing', 'level', '5', 'virgin', 'clinger', 'Gloria', 'Every', 'scene', 'manic', 'fireworks', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'where', 'well', 'playing', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'tear', 'eyes', 'away', 'Vaughn', 'uproarious', 'mugging', ""'ll"", 'see', 'crazed', 'nymphet', 'clearly', 'teetering', 'edge', 'psychosis', 'Gleefully', 'so.The', 'technical', 'details', 'film', 'DVD', 'are', 'fine', 'supplements', 'are', 'enough', 'whet', 'appetite', 'film', 'means', 'sample', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson.As', 'understand', 'Unrated', 'version', 'few', 'more', 'breasts', 'extension', 'goth', 'brother', 'scenes', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'great', 'way', 'laugh', 'two', 'hours']",N/A

I think I achieved that, although for the most part I still agree with the hype's conclusion: this movie is pretty funny.The humor is like ""Old-School"" except for a certain sense of believability which set in about a third-of-the way in, (and summarily left near the end).  In addition, the same crudeness preludes, particularly in the opening five-minute scene, but also just throughout the film in general.  And that's to be expected, because this is not a drama, as much as it's a comedy about some-sort of romance.Speaking of the story, it's probably a good time to go into the plot.  Vaughn and Owen play two best-friend psychologists named John and Jeremy, respectively; at least I think they are psychologists (not that it really matters).  But in the peak times of eternal love, they are wedding crashers looking for short ""romance"", and they are rather successful wedding crashers at that.  But there would be little to the story if that was all, and it's not, so to elaborate further.John and Jeremy, at the pleading bequest of Jeremy, decide to pull off one of the grandest crashes yet, the wedding of the oldest daughter of Secretary Cleary.  They assume elegance will abound, and yacht talk too, but what they don't realize is that maybe this time love is in the air for them too, and away they, and we, go on their cupid journey.The film really isn't bad, unless you completely despise some of the slapstick/vulgar humor (which I could see why).

I have a weakness for Owen Wilson, I admit it.  That broken nose just adds something to him that I find appealing.  Tee hee!  But, to see him using those lines on the gals at the weddings to bed them only to use them again when he at last falls for the perfect woman was disappointing.  Vince Vaughn is subjected to the majority of the physical comedy, and after a while it gets old.  Especially the closeted homosexual brother.  It just gets too obvious after a where the chain of events will go.  Once they are rejected they suddenly become the pursuers, proving the authors of The Rules might have been right all along.  Let him chase you, and then they will have more respect for you. (Although the Vince Vaughn / psycho sister situation is a little too twisted for words.)I was expecting a smutty, more slapstick humor (think the American Pie movies), but it turns into a chick flick on you before you know it.

This movie steers away from these types of unsubtle, ""slap you with a fish"" type of comedies that Ben Stiller is a master of.While at times Wedding Crashers does have that kind of humor, it feels like it's more underlying and sporadic.  It's the kind of movie where you laugh because the characters find themselves in extremely bizarre and hilarious situations, but it's subtle.  Unlike these other comedies, Wedding Crashers wants you to have a good time and laugh, but it doesn't force you to, most of the time they don't TRY to be funny, they just are.  You can tell they want you to laugh WITH them, and not AT them.I just really loved this movie, not only because it was hilarious, but also because of the love story that goes along with it.  It doesn't feel too pushed or ""blah"", in part because while it's essential to the story, it's not the center of it, it's like milk or cream in your coffee, it sweetens the pot.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are great, they have great chemistry and you just want everything to work out for them, they really make you sympathise for them, which is great, it gives the whole movie a little more ""humane"" feel to it.  And Rachel McAdams fantastic, you just fall in love with her as well.  The actress who plays her sister is also extremely hilarious.This movie is great, it's one that you can watch over a 100 times and still laugh every time, thanks to a hilarious yet romantic story and a great cast.

John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are on the prowl in the 2005 hit movie ""Wedding Crashers"".Looking forward to weddings like most people anticipate the holidays, the pair tries to blend in at various nuptials and the receptions afterwards in order to meet unsuspecting ladies who happen to be caught up in the moment.  The scheme works like a charm until John is captivated by Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding and daughter of Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken).Seizing an opportunity to get closer to Claire, John convinces Jeremy (against his better judgment) to spend a few days at the Cleary's estate.  Things aren't easy for them.  John not only has to deal with Claire's competitive and egotistic boyfriend Sack Lodge (Bradley Cooper) but he also has to contend with advances from Claire's mother Kathleen (Jane Seymour).  Jeremy has problems of his own when Claire's sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher) becomes a ""stage five"" clinger after a liaison during the wedding reception as well as having to deal with younger brother Todd (Keir O'Donnell).  Will John and Jeremy be able to find love or will their ""crashing"" days come back to haunt them?I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started watching ""Wedding Crashers"".  It's one of those rare ""rated R comedies"".  But I ended up really liking this one.  The story seemed realistic (who hasn't had an unexpected guest show up at a wedding) and not only had comedic elements but there was also a touch of drama and romance as well.The characters for the most part were likeable and funny.  However, I believe Isla Fisher as the crazed Gloria was one of the best parts of the film.  Is she really obsessive or is it a ploy?  Will Ferrell's uncredited appearance as Chaz, the one who started the notorious wedding crashing, was also a highlight.  I think we're starting to see a trend of having Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (along with Ben Stiller) showing up in various movies together.  They all seem to have a good on-screen chemistry.There were a couple of things that I thought could have been better.  Although he was playing a secondary character, Christopher Walken could have been utilized more.  He's known for some of his over the top characters and I thought this would have worked well in the film.  The side story with Todd could have been played up more as well.  It didn't seem to go anywhere after a while.Is ""Wedding Crashers"" for everyone?  No.  The movie is probably not suitable for younger children or those who are easily offended.

Both ""Batman Begins"" and ""Serenity"" were extremely funny and well written in their own witty manners.  ""Wedding Crashers,"" however, was written to be a comedy, and I have to say that it takes funny to an entirely new level.  Both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have been hilarious before, but the roles they nab in this flick seem to say they were born to star in this movie.""Wedding Crashers"" is that rare movie that combines the comedic excellence of the cast with a very strong, intelligent, hilarious script, and directing that executes the necessary direction flawlessly.  Too often lately, I feel as though movie studios have shyed away from ""R"" rated comedies for many reasons.  The ""R"" rating of course threatens who will actually see a movie, so I understand why studios often create ""R"" rated movies with caution.  What I do not understand, however, is why, until ""Wedding Crashers,"" intelligent, witty, adult-oriented ""R"" rated comedies seemed to have fallen completely off the radar.  For the past 5 years or so, any comedy with an ""R"" rating (or often a PG-13 rating for that matter) had the rating because of disgusting, gross-out gags that forced laughs because of awkwardness and shock value.  ""Wedding Crashers"" was a sigh of relief because it forced nothing.  There were no unnecessary bodily function gags, there were no horribly moronically stupid characters.  The movie worked because for the most part, everything seems believable.  The characters come off as very real people in an improbable, but still possible situation, and interwined with a ""cooky"" love story, the comedy works really really well.I cannot say enough about this film.  I was laughing so hard the first 3 times I saw it that tears were streaming down my face.  Time #4 I had to restrain myself so I could actually hear the punchlines to the jokes so I couldn't tear-up too much.  This movie is great.  The characters are great.

The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite!Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these ""buddies"" looking a bit too disconnected.Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it.

Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play a pair of wedding crashers who have been in the game for a while now.  However, while Vaughn continues to have a blast, Wilson is growing tired; all of which comes to a head when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of a Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), where Vaughn gets in over his head with one love crazed daughter (Isla Fisher) and Wilson falls in love with another (Rachel McAdams).  In between all this there's some enjoyable raunchy humor, but it's Wilson and Vaughn who make Wedding Crashers a winner.  Both stars, particularly Vaughn in another scene stealing role, are comedically brilliant and a joy to watch.

Or could Will Ferrell just teach me the rules of wedding crashing so I can go out and do it on my own?  I'd certainly be up for an invitation for a weekend at Rachel McAdams's family compound.  No matter what I'd get, I'd watch (and have done so) this film over and over again.  Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are living a dream of having fun without regard for the consequences (at least for a while) and viewers will soon be clammering to join them on their wild escapades.  But what this duo truely manages to accomplish is to restrain their antics to the point where they don't become absolutely ubsird (just plain ubsird is reached and that's just fine) while making it look like they are making no such effort.  I can't quite figure out whether to think of Christopher Walken as creepy, menacing, clueless, or what, and that's part of his charm in the film.  Though they share few, if any, scenes, Jane Seymour nicely plays off this characterization to make herself the relentless cougar who has given up on any actual meaning to her marriage to Walken's character.  Rachael McAdams shines in this film and you'll find yourself hoping for her and Wilson's characters to get together the moment he targets her for his (at the time) plans for a one-night-stand (in case you're concerned, those plans seem to go out the window with a cinderblock tied to them before the reception's over, so you can relax...there's already a desire for something more.)  In my mind, Isla Fisher is forever type-cast in this role as McAdams's somewhat nutty and certainly manipulative sister (not a bad thing for this film but it might be a hinderence for future projects.)  Bradley Cooper may be playing a stereotypical villainous jock-type boyfriend to McAdams who's more interested in himself than her or anyone else, but he plays it so well that you can't help but want him gone...and Owen Wilson takes us in that direction with an eyedropper.  Ellen Albertini Dow (there's a mouthful) and Keir O'Donnell round out this nutty family as the foul-mouthed grandmother and artistic homosexual brother who develops feelings for Vince Vaughn.  Is it just me or is Jenny Alden the only sane member of that family?  Well, whether sane or insane, the family, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, and the rest of the cast come together to make a movie that will leave you laughing and wanting to watch them again for more laughs.

I don't know how this movie did it, outperforming two $100 million made movies that flopped, Stealth and The Island back in July.  Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson do everything they can to crash the glitziest and glamorous of weddings and receptions in the Washington, D.C. area. Vince is absolutely funny all throughout the film. There's a point in the film where the friendship of Owen and Vince's characters are in jeopardy. Owen caught Vince with the crazy woman he was falling head over heels with. They stay far away from each other, but befriend each other later. This movie had the best plot script out of all the summer films--you could follow through it.  Sometimes, it wears thin on the last 20 minutes. This is true adult comedy at its funniest, with many raunchy scenes. I saw Vince in three movies in 2005, and this movie matches well with his tough guy, crazy comedy image.  This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in 5 years, even rivals some of Jim Carrey's comedies!

944330,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B000BKVQRU,Publius,"[10, 18]","""Wedding Crashers"" is a movie that has an interesting premise with good actors but goes absolutely nowhere.  This film falls neatly into another comedy that came out at the same time: The 40 Year Old Virgin.  However, in the second half of that movie, the serious parts really picked up the pace of the movie.  In the ""Wedding Crashers"" the serious parts just drag the movie down to the level where you start looking at your watch.  Like ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" it has pretensions of respectability.  However, a movie that tries to be serious, cannot have scenes that make absolutely no sense.  (I.E. After the Clary family finds out that the Vaughan and Wilson are fakes, Vaughan still marries into the family and all is forgiven?) If you're trying to be a sex comedy at least have enough respect for the audience to give the viewer some coherence to the plot.  You can't have your wedding cake and eat it too.  Instead, the directors are quite content to just throw some meaningless banter about male ethos and plenty of shots of nude women, and that will , in turn, satisfy 95 % of the viewing public.  This apparently worked if one looks at the reviews under me, and the generally positive reviews that this movie received.  As for the comedic team of Vaughan and Wilson, critics have said that they are one of the best comedic teams working today.  Instead this terrible screenplay makes them seem like two old women bantering at the ladies auxliary club at church.  It's no small feat for Will Ferrell to bring down a movie, but ""Wedding Crashers"" achieves that, which is a feat in and of itself.  The real triumph of this movie is that people so wanted to believe that this movie was good, that it got decent reviews and made a handsome amount of money for a year that was terrible for Hollywood.  I mean, how could a movie with Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson crashing weddings not be funny?

And up till now, John and Jeremy have been able to pull off their little ruse pretty much without a hitch - until, that is, the day they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary of the United States.  Then all hell breaks loose...""The Wedding Crashers"" is a comedy vehicle built for speed.  The dialogue comes so fast and furious that it's occasionally hard to absorb everything the characters are saying.  David Dobkin has followed suit in his direction, keeping the film going full-throttle at all points.  That's the good news about ""The Wedding Crashers.""  The bad news is that, as the movie goes on, the jokes and setups have a tendency to become a trifle strained, forced and labored, and the laughs begin to diminish as a result.  It's not that there aren't some very funny moments in ""The Wedding Crashers,"" just that there aren't nearly as many as there should be.As the two party crashers, Owen Wilson takes the role of the smooth-talking romantic lead, while Vince Vaughn gets to be the cynical victim of circumstances that such buddy comedies seem to require.  Both are very good, but Vaughn, in particular, hits all the right notes as a man who finally meets his match with a girl (charmingly played by Isla Fisher) who has no intention of letting him get away from her after just a one night stand.

944348,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000BKVQRU,Samuel McKewon,"[10, 20]","""Wedding Crashers"" is snug fit for a new subcategory in the comedy genre: Rage humor. Ostensibly about two crude dudes who cruise wedding receptions looking for easy girls and cheap laughs, the movie is really a manifesto on the guilty lusts and yearnings of the middle-class man. There is a cruelty and cynicism running under the action of this and ""Old School,"" most Adam Sandler flicks, and the ""American Pie"" trilogy.And while some films - ""About A Boy,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" - actually examine the paradigms that create puerile adults, ""Wedding Crashers,"" far more sentimental than its premise would suggest, assumes the emotional infancy of its two main characters and couches their awakening in a fantasy worthy of a John Hughes production. Itis not so much funny as it is manipulative.John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) are divorce mediators - at least in the opening scene - who spend their Washington D.C. summers scouting the fanciest nuptials, blending into the party, and picking off tipsy romantics. They have a rulebook, occasionally quoted, with equality - both guys must score, or neither does - as its highest virtue. ""Wedding Crashers"" is funniest in its opening scenes, before the boys meet the family of U.S. Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) and his daughters Gloria (Isla Fisher) and Claire (Rachel McAdams).The movie spends its next hour at the Cleary summer house, as the smitten John tries to coax Claire away from boyfriend Sack (Bradley Cooper) while Jeremy has conflicting desires about the predatory, clingy Gloria. The rest of the Cleary clan are one-note jokes expressed as performances - including a purposely bizarre son, potty-mouthed grandma, and boozy matriarch (Jane Seymour) - but the linchpin to the movie's tone is amoral, abusive Sack. Dressed like a Soc from ""The Outsiders"" and played by Cooper with deranged glee, Sack is a black-hatted villain of violent duplicity - convicted murderer Scott Peterson on steroids.Reminiscent of Craig Kilborn's repugnant turn in ""Old School,"" Sack's existence suggests a social commentary on the part of writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher and director David Dobkin meant to dismiss John and Jeremy's reckless behavior - they're sleazebags with a heart of gold, ya know - via this display of ugly masculinity, while tacking up a thesis against those impossibly gorgeous, witty rich girls who cave to societal pressure to marry goons of the upper crust. The examination of such fragile creatures has been a preeminent American theme since ""The Great Gatsby;"" the gulf between Fitzgerald's aim of demystifying a social class,  and ""Wedding Crashers,"" which means to forgive undisciplined lust in light of Sack's brutality is massive. Ditto the goal of ""Old School"" to forgive alcoholism and immaturity if it means becoming a fatuous, slick pig.None of the subtext makes it any funnier. Vaughn is relegated to sidekick in the narrative, but the movie's humor belongs almost solely to his verbal riffs, which benefit from Vaughn's size and image of a raconteur gone to seed and red-rimmed world weariness. There is a Oscar performance inside Vaughn should the right dramatic role present itself; like Ray Liotta, he was born with equal parts manic showman and twisted intellectual. But Wilson tends to avoid his niche like the plague and play whatever pays the bills, thus he is again a cool-guy leading man without any lines, looks or natural charm to recommend him. He generates nothing with McAdams, whose bright smirk creates enough chemistry for both of them.As for the rest of the principals: Fisher gets her 15 minutes. Cooper pages Eric Roberts in the psych ward. Walken is stiff and sincere. Translated: He was paid to show up to be in the trailer. And Will Ferrell, in what needs to be the last cameo of his career, is asked to rescue the last half of the movie in a short stint as an aging wedding crasher named Chazz. A dead-armed aging quarterback, Farrell presses embarrassingly - he resorts to yelling as comedy - and gesticulates mindlessly.Kneading a myth with middlebrow gutter humor as it does, ""Wedding Crashers"" was a remarkable success in the moment, but like Sandler's many lesser works, it is destined to become a fallback favorite of young Americans who laugh so as not to sit stunned by the silence of their smudgy morality as they root on brown shirt lounge lizards.",2,"Amidst the raunchy humor, a current of anger and brutality",1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,4415,"['Wedding', 'Crashers',

944349,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B000BKVQRU,Scooter McGavin,"[0, 2]","Last summer, Wedding Crashers was toted as the return of R-Rated comedies and which basically means more swearing and nudity. But a movie can have all the F-bombs and boobies, it still needs to have a plot, good acting, and be well written for it to be entertaining. The plot itself is brilliant, built around the concept that there is no better place to hook up than at weddings. And just because you are not invited shouldn't stop you from sampling from the easy chick buffet.As for the acting Vince Vaughn returns to his roots by channeling the character that made him a star, Double Down Trent from Swingers although his character her might actually be more over the top. His partner in crime is the low key Owen Wilson who unsuccessfully tries to ground Vaughn throughout the film. After years of successfully crashing weddings they decide to crash the granddaddy of all weddings, that of the daughter of Treasury Secretary played by the always get Christopher Walken. But things get off track want Wilson decides to break one of the rules of wedding crashing, Rule #22: You have a wedding and a reception to seal the deal. Period. No overtime. But Wilson, in a play to win over the Secretary's daughter, accepts an invitation on Vaughn's behalf, who hooked up with another of his daughters, to his summer house for the weekend. But I'm sure anyone would do the same thing if the girl in question happens to be the hot chick from The Notebook (not that I've seen it or anything).The writing is what brings the movie down somewhat as there were a few lulls in the movie where nothing seems to be happening. Plus there is an uber-cheesy montage where Wilson, in the middle of the night, goes to the door of the girl he is pining over only to go back to his room instead of knocking only for the girl to decide to go to his room later, but decides not to knock either. And one can't help to think that most of the funniest lines were ad-libbed by Vaughn and Wilson.Be sure to check out the extra on the DVD including the 24 pages of rules to crashing wedding.

944351,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000BKVQRU,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","David Dobkin's ""Wedding Crashers"" will go down in cinematic history, if at all, as one of the great near-misses of our time.  All the elements were there, from a great comic premise to a stellar cast (even down to its supporting roles) and the guts to go for an 'R' rating in a PG-13 age (PG-13 being more box-office friendly).  But at the end, despite a couple of good laughs and inspired scenes, ""Wedding Crashers"" is a good comedy that could have been great.The plot is simple.  John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet horny girls.  This premise leads to a great (if very long) opening montage as the daring duo crashes wedding after wedding, invariably ending up as the life of the party and in bed with beauties.  Their cover stories of how they are tangentially connected to the family are clever, and there are several references to ""the Rules.""But as the wedding season winds down, there is ""One Last Score.""  The eldest daughter of the Cleary family (the Maryland version of the Kennedys) is getting hitched in the biggest wedding of the year.  John and Jeremy crash, and John violates the biggest crasher rule of them all - he falls in love with the delectable Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, of ""Red Eye"" fame).John and Jeremy are invited back to the Cleary estate, where Dad (Christopher Walken) and Mom (Jane Seymour) hold court over the typical upper crust version of the Family from Hell.  While John must try to win the heart of Claire away from the dastardly WASP-on-Steroids, her fiance Sack, Jeremy must deal with the clinging, hyper-in-love younger Cleary daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher, who would steal the movie if given the chance).This astounding premise is mildly funny, but not up to expectations.  Walken, one of my absolute favorite actors and a comic genius, is given surprisingly little to do.  It's a waste of Christopher Walken if you see him in a comedy and he doesn't inspire any laugh-out-loud moments.  But there are no Walken Moments to be found in this film.  Similarly, Jane Seymour could have been hilarious as the oversexed Mrs. Robinson character, but she virtually disappears from the film after a big scene.  And Claire is given surprisingly little to do other than to play the object of desire.The movie devolves into a long, ""will John get the girl"" story that is completely drawn out, and the flick's few moments of Third Act comic inspiration just don't quite make it.This is not to say that you won't enjoy ""Wedding Crashers.""  However, we must regret the fact that ""Wedding Crashers"" won't become one of those hallowed all-time comedies, and it could have been.",4,"Funny bits and great opening montage highlight film that doesn't quite rate ""Classic""",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2650,"['David', 'Dobkin', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'cinematic', 'history', 'one', 'great', 'near-misses', 'time', 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'great', 'comic', 'premise', 'stellar', 'cast', 'even', 'down', 'supporting', 'roles', 'guts', 'go', 'R', 'rating', 'PG-13', 'age', 'PG-13', 'being', 'more', 'box-office', 'friendly', 'end', 'couple', 'good', 'laughs', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'good', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'crash', 'weddings', 'meet', 'horny', 'girls', 'premise', 'great', 'very', 'long', 'opening', 'montage', 'daring', 'duo', 'crashes', 'wedding', 'wedding', 'invariably', 'ending', 'up', 'life', 'party', 'bed', 'beauties', 'cover', 'stories', 'how', 'are', 'tangentially', 'connected', 'family', 'are', 'clever', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'Rules', 'wedding', 'season', 'down', 'One', 'Last', 'Score', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Cleary', 'family', 'Maryland', 'version', 'Kennedys', 'getting', 'hitched', 'biggest', 'wedding', 'year', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'crash', 'John', 'biggest', 'crasher', 'rule', 'love', 'delectable', 'Claire', 'Cleary', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Red', 'Eye', 'fame', '.John', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'invited', 'back', 'Cleary', 'estate', 'where', 'Dad', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mom', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'hold', 'court', 'typical', 'upper', 'crust', 'version', 'Family', 'Hell', 'John', 'must', 'try', 'win', 'heart', 'Claire', 'away', 'dastardly', 'WASP-on-Steroids', 'fiance', 'Sack', 'Jeremy', 'must', 'deal', 'clinging', 'hyper-in-love', 'younger', 'Cleary', 'daughter', 'Gloria', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'would', 'steal', 'movie', 'given', 'chance', 'astounding', 'premise', 'mildly', 'funny', 'not', 'expectations', 'Walken', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'actors', 'comic', 'genius', 'given', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'do', 'waste', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'see', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'are', 'Walken', 'Moments', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'Similarly', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'oversexed', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'character', 'virtually', 'film', 'big', 'scene', 'Claire', 'given', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'play', 'object', 'desire.The', 'movie', 'long', 'will', 'John', 'get', 'girl', 'story', 'completely', 'drawn', 'out', 'flick', 'few', 'moments', 'Third', 'Act', 'comic', 'inspiration', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'it.This', 'not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'However', 'must', 'regret', 'fact', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'one', 'hallowed', 'all-time', 'comedies', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

944354,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000BKVQRU,Sebastian Fernandez,"[2, 3]","It has been several years since a movie made me laugh as much as this one did. I watched it using headphones, sitting next to my wife, and she stopped what she was doing several times and looked at me like I had gone crazy. The truth is that if you enjoy humor that is sometimes politically incorrect, and even a little rude, you will have a blast with this film.The premise is pretty simple, John and Jeremy are two friends that crash weddings and not only get free food and drinks, but also hook up with a lot of girls in the process. They are living the good life and stay on this path of hit and run fun for a while. But when at the wedding of the daughter of Secretary William Cleary they get together with the two sisters of the bride, things get a little more complicated. They end up going on a weekend trip to an island with the family and close friends of the just married couple, and the madness goes on a rampage.The cast does an outstanding job. I was surprised by how good Vince Vaughn was onThe Break-Up, but I think he is even better on this movie, with a great delivery of some extremely funny lines. I have been disappointed in the past by Owen Wilson, but here he made me laugh out loud, and he certainly showed us that he can play the ""good"" guy effectively. Then there is Isla Fisher, who is great in her role of Gloria, the nymph that ""captures"" Jeremy in her net and makes Glenn Close inFatal Attractionlook sane. The rest of the cast does not lag far behind, including a conflicted brother of the bride, a mother in need of attention, and a priest that gets more than he bargained for, but I have to make a special mention for Will Ferrell. Fans of this actor know what I am talking about. In the couple of scenes in which he partakes from the action, he makes us laugh so much that it is unbelievable.I think that by now it is pretty clear. Those that like ""proper"" humor should not even consider watching this. However, if you are looking for one of the funniest movies in the last several years and do not care much about political correctness, this is a film you cannot miss.",5,"""Rule Number One: Never Leave a Fellow Crasher Behind""",1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,2103,"['been', 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'made', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'did', 'watched', 'using', 'headphones', 'sitting', 'next', 'wife', 'stopped', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'several', 'times', 'looked', 'had', 'gone', 'crazy', 'truth', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'even', 'little', 'rude', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'film.The', 'premise', 'pretty', 'simple', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'two', 'friends', 'crash', 'weddings', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'free', 'food', 'drinks', 'also', 'hook', 'up', 'lot', 'girls', 'process', 'are', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'stay', 'path', 'hit', 'run', 'fun', 'while', 'when', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Secretary', 'William', 'Cleary', 'get', 'together', 'two', 'sisters', 'bride', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'weekend', 'trip', 'island', 'family', 'close', 'friends', 'just', 'married', 'couple', 'madness', 'rampage.The', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'job', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'onThe', 'Break-Up', 'think', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'great', 'delivery', 'extremely', 'funny', 'lines', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'past', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'here', 'made', 'loud', 'certainly', 'showed', 'can', 'play', 'good', 'guy', 'effectively', 'Then', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'great', 'role', 'Gloria', 'nymph', 'captures', 'Jeremy', 'net', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'inFatal', 'Attractionlook', 'sane', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'lag', 'far', 'including', 'conflicted', 'brother', 'bride', 'mother', 'need', 'attention', 'priest', 'more', 'bargained', 'have', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Fans', 'actor', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'couple', 'scenes', 'action', 'so', 'much', 'unbelievable.I', 'think', 'now', 'pretty', 'clear', 'proper', 'humor', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'watching', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'political', 'correctness', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'miss']",N/A

Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com clich&eacute;. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fianc&eacute;e Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film.",3,Wilson and Vaughn: The Perfect Couple?,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2450,"['Frat-Pack', 'are', 'surely', 'hardest', 'working', 'collective', 'Hollywood', 'Hardly', 'month', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Wilson', 'boys', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'being', 'released.When', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'paired', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'good', 'when', 'Dodgeball', 'put', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'better', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'Frat-Pack', 'pairing', 'date.Although', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'have', 'appeared', 'four', 'movies', 'together', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'where', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'star', 'billing', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Wilson', 'Jeremy', 'Klein', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'pair', 'divorce', 'mediators', 'passion', 'life', 'sneaking', 'weddings', 'take', 'advantage', 'free', 'food..', 'course', 'score', 'girls.They', 'have', 'strict', ""'crashers"", 'rulebook', 'etiquette', 'pick-up', 'such', 'real', 'name', 'also', 'behaving', 'raucously', 'loudly', 'generally', 'being', 'life-and-soul', 'people', 'will', 'think', ""'re"", 'so', 'obnoxious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'have', 'been', 'invited.The', 'pair', 'eventually', 'find', 'odds', 'other', 'when', 'John', 'meets', 'falls', 'bridesmaid', 'Washington', 'society', 'wedding', 'year.Although', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'times', 'formulaic', 'comic', 'performances', 'raise', 'movie', 'par', 'lesser', 'hands', 'main', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'descended', 'Rom-Com', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fast-talking', 'machine-gun', 'delivery', 'Vaughn', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'Wilson', 'laconic', 'style', 'single-guy', 'banter', 'often', 'painfully', 'accurate', 'acknowledgement', ""'re"", 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'acting', 'so', 'carelessly', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'comic', 'set-pieces', 'too', 'notably', 'divorce', 'meeting', 'weddings', 'montage', 'cringe-worthy', 'football', 'game', 'hunting', 'trip.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'asset', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'expertly', 'tightrope', 'being', 'broodingly', 'intimidating', 'likable', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', ""'Claire"", 'charming', 'vulnerability', 'easy-to-fall-in', 'love', 'quality', 'Former', 'Home', 'Away', 'pin-up', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'however', 'less', 'convincing.I', 'admit', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'far', 'perfect', 'time', 'situations', 'seem', 'too', 'contrived', 'nudity', 'laughably', 'gratuitous', 'Claire', 'evil', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sack', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'almost', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'device', 'make', 'Wilson', 'look', 'good.But', 'can', 'look', 'simply', 'accept', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'very', 'funny', 'film']",N/A

In Wedding Crashers, the two worked well together.  It's unfortunate that the storyline as well as supporting cast were horrendous.  Banter between the two headliners was great, but everything else was unwatchable.  The ""villain"" of the movie (Sack, Zack, or whatever) was horrible.

The first half started out funny, though very far fetched, and some of the lines and facial expressions of the characters were great.  But it seemed to deteriorate in the second half, and the writing became so unbelievable that it lost most of it's humor for me.In the movie the main love interest of Owen Wilson (Rachel McAdams) is engaged to a guy who is so obviously a jerk, that I began to lose respect for her stupidity in staying with him for three years.  And Owen WIlson supposedly falls madly in love with Rachel McAdams in two days, after sharing a few laughs, a nice bike ride, and a game of hitting each other's hands on the beach.  She seems to be falling for him too and even kisses him, yet proceeds with plans to marry the abusive jerk she had been dating.  Because she finds out that Owen lied about being a relative, she never listens to his explaination, despite him trying for months to contact her.  And irregardless of whether he lied or not, it's still unbelievable that she'd continue to marry the jerk.I am all for zany comedies (I usually like them and loved 40 Year Old Virgin), but when they cross the line into poor writing and poor character development, they lose some of the wit and humor.This movie had some laugh out loud moments, but for me there were too many things that didn't fit and didn't work to make it a good movie.",2,"Ruanchy and funny in parts, but with serious flaws",1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,1487,"['bought', 'movie', 'assuming', 'would', 'like', 'popular', 'great', 'cast', 'especially', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'comedy', 'first', 'half', 'started', 'out', 'funny', 'though', 'very', 'far', 'fetched', 'lines', 'facial', 'expressions', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'seemed', 'deteriorate', 'second', 'half', 'writing', 'became', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'lost', 'most', 'humor', 'me.In', 'movie', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'engaged', 'guy', 'who', 'so', 'obviously', 'jerk', 'began', 'lose', 'respect', 'stupidity', 'staying', 'three', 'years', 'Owen', 'WIlson', 'supposedly', 'madly', 'love', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'two', 'days', 'sharing', 'few', 'laughs', 'nice', 'bike', 'ride', 'game', 'hitting', 'other', 'hands', 'beach', 'be', 'falling', 'too', 'even', 'yet', 'proceeds', 'plans', 'marry', 'abusive', 'jerk', 'had', 'been', 'dating', 'out', 'Owen', 'lied', 'being', 'relative', 'never', 'explaination', 'trying', 'months', 'contact', 'irregardless', 'lied', 'not', 'still', 'unbelievable', ""'d"", 'continue', 'marry', 'jerk.I', 'am', 'zany', 'comedies', 'usually', 'loved', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'when', 'cross', 'line', 'poor', 'writing', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'lose', 'wit', 'humor.This', 'movie', 'had', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'make', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

944381,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000BKVQRU,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 0]","I think it's important to get biases out of the way.  I love the rated R raunchy comedies.  When American Pie came out to theatres, I loved it and saw the subsequent sequels.  Animal House ranks up as a great comedy for me as does some of the modern college student humor movies like Road Trip and Eurotrip and Old School.  I have a soft spot for these movies.  And, for me, Wedding Crashers smashes most of these movies.In fact, Wedding Crashers is probably the funniest movie I have seen in years.  I mean that honestly and truly, not as some fanatic omgwtflolrofl way.  I generally don't make such huge claims as say ""BEST MOVIE EVAH!""  But from the opening credits to the end, I was laughing more than anything else.  These comedies rely on mature humor, usually of the sexual kind, and zany situations that most people would hopefully never find themselves in.  These movies also will succeed or fail based on the writing and the actors.First off, the writing is sharp and realistic, while at the same time humorous.  The scenarios and the dialogue works really well.  But honestly, the main kudos have to go to Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn who act so well together and create such a great comedic rhythm together.  But even the supporting cast is terrific.  From Jane ""Medicine Woman"" Seymour and her over the top sexuality to Christopher Walken and his unique brand of humor, everyone is spot on.In particular, the two sisters are great.  The ever-lovely Rachel McAdams is, of course, beautiful and funny.  She's one of the best young actresses right now and I'm hoping she becomes the next big thing.  But the actress who stole the movie for me was Isla Fisher as Gloria Clearly.  She was absolutely perfect as the beautiful but kind of nuts sister that Vince Vaughn falls for.  Starting out as a ""needy virgin type"" (as Vaughn calls her) and going through some nutso, put her in a straight jacket moments she is the reason I came to the movie and provides some of the more subtle humor.At the heart, though, Wedding Crashers is a romantic comedy.  It has all of the cliches, the love triangle, the lie, the moment when the lie comes to light, the break up and the inevitable get back together.  It's nothing new and romantic comedies will probably continue this tradition far into the future.  What differentiates the movies in the genre, is how we get from point A to point C.  In this case, we have a hillarious movie and great characters.  This is what makes this movie much much better than some of its romantic comedy contemporaries coming out recently and what, for me, gave it much higher marks.

944382,A3UW2LF45BOPY7,B000BKVQRU,The Deac,"[1, 2]","2005 was not exactly the best year for movies.  There were more disappointments than success stories.  But one of the few bright spots, especially over the summer, was Wedding Crashers.  It exceeded expectations, and hopefully will usher in a new batch of R-Rated comedies in the future.Vince Vaughn showed big potential in Old School, and really jumped out here into a comedic lead role.  Owen Wilson was also funny, but Vaughn steals nearly every scene he is in.  Isla Fisher is the perfect counterpart to Vaughn, and likewise draws a huge reaction just about every time you see her.  The formula is great, since the story really revolves around Wilson's quest for Rachel McAdam's Claire.  It allows Vaughn and Fisher to enter at the right time and knock you out.  Wilson and McAdams play their roles excellently as well, but its Vaughn & Fisher that really stand out.  And of course Chazz...I won't give that away, but the end of the movie is more than saved by the introduction of his character.The DVD has some neat features.  Nothing spectacular, but worth a look.  I have seen other deleted scenes that were not included on the DVD, which is somewhat disappointing, but overall that is just a minor gripe.This movie is just 100% fun, and the best laugh in quite a long time.

944386,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BKVQRU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","This is one hilarious film.I avoided it for a couple of weeks and now I am sorry that I did. Initially, it looks like every other comedy Hollywood makes, where the best jokes (if there are any) are all in the trailer. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are two divorce mediators in Washington, D.C. One morning, Jeremy walks into John's office and announces that it is the beginning of wedding season. They have seventeen weddings to crash over the next few weeks, all types of weddings from an Irish couple, to a traditional Jewish wedding, from a Chinese couple to an Indian couple. They have elevated the practice of crashing weddings to an art form; they come up with new personas, pick up lines, and backgrounds for a variety of weddings every year, all to pick up the most beautiful women at each wedding. They become accepted, celebrated members of the wedding, giving toasts, helping to cut the cake and more. At the end of the season, John is starting to wonder if he wants more from life. Then Jeremy enters and shows him the newspaper announcement of the wedding of Treasury Secretary Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter. This is the Rolls Royce of weddings and the ultimate challenge for them; there will be foreign dignatires, they will have to get past the Secret Service, etc. At the wedding, John catches the attention of Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy attracts the attention of Gloria (Isla Fisher), both of the Secretary's other daughters who are bridesmaids. Both start to work their magic on them and then they get invited to the Secretary's house, down the shore, for the weekend.From the first few minutes of the film, as John and Jeremy are mediating the divorce between Mr. & Mrs. Kroeger (Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay), you remember that the film is `R-rated' due to some language used. Oh, yeah. The film is R-Rated! An R-Rated comedy for adults! What a novel concept. In this day and age of PG-13 horror and action films, an R-Rated comedy is a welcome treat. It is refreshing to see a comedy about adults who are horny and in sexual overdrive, rather than just the normal teenagers. If the film were cut for a PG-13 rating, we would miss a lot of the ribald humor ""Crashers"" currently contains.The film begins with John and Jeremy crashing a series of weddings, insinuating themselves into the lives and activities of the people in attendance. This part of the film is amusing and fast paced. But when the boys hit the Cleary wedding, the real story kicks into gear. Jeremy attracts the eye of Gloria (Isla Fisher) and she insists they join the family for the weekend, at their house on the Delaware shore. John is immediately smitten with Claire and begins to romance her. When he finds out she already has a boyfriend, Sack (Bradley Cooper), he readily agrees to the invitation for the opportunity to woo her away.As soon as they arrive at the Cleary house, the comedy kicks into overdrive and Vince Vaughn runs away with the show. Owen Wilson is good, but he is more or less the straight man, providing balance to the film. But Vaughn's Jeremy is a work of comedic art. Unrepentant, uncensored and unforgiving, he crashes weddings for one reason and one reason only; to have sex with as many different women as possible. When he meets Gloria and gets talked into spending time with her family, the situation spins out of control, forcing him to try to regain control. This all proves very difficult for him and creates some of the funniest scenes and dialogue I have experienced in a long time.This is the type of film where you get the feeling you are missing things because you can't hear over the laughter. Also, there is one scene that made me laugh so hard I was crying. Its been a long time since that happened.Wilson's John is the more centered part of the film. His relationship with Claire is the more normal relationship. Sure, it creates some laughter but it is also meant to be sweet and charming, and it is. Rachel McAdams is really beautiful and her character is charming, funny and intelligent. She seems the perfect match for Wilson, a girl who isn't so bland, who doesn't get lost in all of the craziness surrounding them.""Wedding Crashers"" isn't a perfect film. The last twenty minutes of the film drag... and drag... and drag, but this is because the first ninety were so good. It would've been great if they had found a way to maintain the momentum throughout, but I'm willing to overlook the problem.Also, a couple of the situations don't really work. At one point, Walken says that the men should go on a quail hunt. This provides an opportunity to get into a silly outfit, to see how ""silly and uptight"" rich people are, but the comedic value of this scene is a bit forced.Also, Walken is a bit sedate. He doesn't really do his `Walken-shtick', instead simply reacting to the people around him.These few criticisms seem minor when the majority of the film is so well-done, so funny, and so memorable.",4,Wedding Crashers,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,5068,"['one', 'hilarious', 'film.I', 'avoided', 'couple', 'weeks', 'now', 'am', 'sorry', 'did', 'Initially', 'other', 'comedy', 'Hollywood',

944390,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B000BKVQRU,Tom Collier,"[19, 32]","Wedding Crashers is a film about one good supporting actor and one terrible supporting actor. They both sign up for an R-rated summer comedy that has a vulgar, witless, terrible script. Before they know it, Satan is proved to be real as audiences flock to their film, and before long it makes over $200 million during a year where audiences are supposedly staying home.Wait, sorry. My mistake. What I just wrote was the real-life story behind Wedding Crashers, not the story of the film itself. To say the film is witless probably doesn't do it justice; it is as if they made the funniest film in history, examined the funny scenes, and decided to reshoot them all, only doing the exact opposite of the original content. The jokes are sophomoric,tasteless, and stupid, all at once.Not a single good performance is turned in. Owen Wilson is terrible, devoid of any charm and reading his lines from a cue card and pretending to be stoned without actually being stoned. Vince Vaughn has proven his worth before, but trades in his usual sarcastic calm for a slightly panicked jerkiness. Christopher Walken is in many scenes, but obviously the producers thought that simply having Walken around is funny, because he is not assigned one single joke. Will Ferrel turns in a cameo as the most over-exposed idiot in show business. Wait, there I go again, confusing the plot of the film with real life. In the film, he plays a funeral crasher.Every character is achingly unsympathetic. Wilson and Vaughn play two jerks who come to weddings uninvited to score with lovelorn chicks. Both are total liars and frauds, even to each other. The script demands that Wilson fall in love with Rachel McAdams after four minutes of movie flirting, and her character is a grade A harlot for cheating on her fiancee. Wait, this infidelity is supposed to be okay, because the fiancee is a sadistic sociopath who maliciously injures every man and joyfully has sex with women he sees. Rounding out the list of wonderfully pleasant characters are a cursing granny, a psychotic redhead who molests Vaughn, and a gay 'artist' who only wants to molest Vaughn.

They are fairly good at what they do and seem to enjoy what they do.  The reason for this is that in the springtime they take off and travel around the country seeking weddings to crash.  It doesn't matter the ethnicity or culture of the people involved, they have an identity for each one.  Besides the free food and drinks, the reason the duo crashes these weddings is so that they can pick up women who have become sexually aroused by the weddings.  It's one woman after another and a seemingly neverending party.  That is until Jeremy convinces John to attend the wedding of the daughter of Treasure Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken).  It's a lavish affair and John becomes smitten with Cleary's daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy just wants to roll around in the hay with Cleary's daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher).  John and Jeremy are invited by the daughters back to the family estate for the weekend and John begs Jeremy to go so that he can try to get to know Claire better, even though she has a jerk boyfriend named Sack (Bradley Cooper).  It's a weekend full of comic mishaps and misunderstandings that eventually leads to some sappy nonsense about love and relationships.WEDDING CRASHERS features a lot of situational comedy and is seeped in innuendo.  There's also some brief glimpses of nude women.  All of that appeals heavily to adolescent males and helped make the movie one of the top grossing films of 2005, led it to be named as one of ""The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time"" in 2006 by Premiere magazine, and gave both Wilson and Vaughn one of the biggest movies of their careers up to that point.But that's really all just fluff.  The main reasons to watch WEDDING CRASHERS is for the dialogue and to see Christopher Walken.  Props to writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher (as well as Olson and Vaughn who adlibbed some bits) for giving Jeremy and John such witty diatribe throughout the film.  Whether it's about the virtues of not-dating, thoughtfully reflecting upon how to live a meaningful life, or a pontification about falling in love, WEDDING CRASHERS has some great dialogue to quote.  As for the other reason to watch, it's Christopher Walken. We should watch anything that man does. Enough said.I don't enjoy WEDDING CRASHERS as much as my brothers or some of my friends do.  It has some funny moments and I can see why it is so popular.  However, it's definitely not a movie for everyone.  That's not to say that I didn't like it, because that's not true.  I just don't think it's as funny as a lot of people think it is.  Still, it's still a movie that any serious movie buff should see at least once.  If nothing else, you'll at least have some great dialogue to bring up in conversations later.The DVD includes two commentaries, one with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the other with director David Dobkin.

The basis is very simple.  Two 30-something guys, best friends, etc. crash weddings to meet (and score, of course) with attractive single women.  Then the expectedly unexpected happens... they meet beautiful women, fall in love, the secret gets out, and hilarity strikes.  Pretty formulaic of course, but the dialogue is brisk, the jokes mostly stay on target, there's a bit of raunch (but nothing you couldn't watch with your grandparents), and it doesn't get so stupid that you just shake your head and groan.The real strengths are the writing, and Vince Vaughn.  Owen Wilson does a decent job of playing the sensitive, almost effeminate buddy, but it's really Vaughn's delivery (and the antics of his girlfriend, played with appropriate psychosis by Isla Fisher) that really steal the show.  Fisher and Rachel McAdams are both admirable eye candy, and Christopher Walken also fills in admirably as the Secretary of the Treasury/intimidating father.All in all, a great comedy to watch ""with the guys"" or with your special someone, and unlike a lot of other comedies it actually holds up to repeated viewings quite tolerably.

944402,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000BKVQRU,Wanda B. Red,"[0, 6]","I'd like to define a new genre in the movies: films that milk a peculiar premise for the maximum number of jokes in poor taste. ""Wedding Crashers"" would be a founding member of this genre. The genre would also include ""Failure to Launch,"" ""Prime,"" and perhaps even ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- and plenty of others. It's not that these films are not funny, but their humor depends too much on beating one questionable plot device to death. In the case of the ""Wedding Crashers,"" the premise (two guys pursue with great imagination and relentless enthusiasm a hobby of attending the weddings of people they don't know so that they can bed chicks) is ludicrous on so many counts it's hard to keep track. Not least of whch is that most normal people would find the idea of attending the weddings of folks they have never met to be a crashing bore.Beyond that basic objection: Is it because I saw the uncorked version that I feel slimed -- or is it just because I am old? Maybe it's because looking at really a lot of naked breasts just isn't my idea of a great time at the movies. In any case, I identified with Owen Wilson in his candid reply to  Vince Vaughn when he claimed youth as an excuse for their hijinx: ""You're not that young.""I guess you have to be very young (certainly younger than I am) and carefree to find this a plausible plot framework or to embrace these sleazy early-middle-age sex mongers as hilariously funny and desirable guys. Will Ferrell's cameo appearance near the end as the aging hipster who likes to pick up chicks at funerals and makes lewd gestures about how he is about to nail them in the sack -- well, blech, pretty unappealing. As Owen Wilson says at one point (who knows his character's name, he takes on so many identities), ""Well, yes, pathetic probably is the best word for it.""So, it's a watchable movie, but my hope is that we are seeing the bottom of the bad taste barrel and maybe in the future such talented actors as Owen Wilson (who I really like) and Vince Vaughan (whose staccato delivery of all his lines is admirable but grating) will find parts that will allow them to explore themselves more fully as actors and as human beings.

Divorce mediators Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) have a most unusual hobby that allows them to pick up women seeking commitment but avoid the dreaded band of gold themselves-crashing weddings! This clever duo can masquerade as friends of the family regardless of who is involved. When Jeremy learns that the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) he and John do the old Potomac Two Step and waltz right in as if they are close friends of the family. What they find is...love, desire and a family as nutty as a fruit cake. John is immediately taken with Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy finds her sister Gloria (Isla Fisher)attractive, frightening and a handful.A genre mishmash of a buddy/romantic comedy, ""Wedding Crashers"" works so well not necessarily because of how good the material is (and it is pretty good) but due to the deft talents of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in the lead roles. Both give charming performances and the marvelous supporting cast provides perfect counterpoint to these charming rogues. ""Wedding Crashers"" became the biggest comedy of the summer and deservedly so.Featuring a stellar transfer that looks as bright detailed as a designer wedding dress, ""Wedding Crashers"" looks and sounds marvelous in this edition. Using the seamless branching technique that worked so well for ""Gladiator: Special Edition"" and ""Alien"", ""Wedding Crashers"" can be viewed in either its original R rated format or unrated. The unrated edition runs a little over eight minutes longer and primarily consists of scene extensions. The images are vivid with bright lively colors. I didn't detect any sort of digital artifacts and analog defects are nonexistent. The 5.1 format isn't used as well as an action movie but there are nice effects placed all around the speakers. Dialogue is crisp and clear which is what you want in a comedy.We get some interesting extras here.  We get deleted scenes, two featurettes one that shows how the weddings were staged for the movie and the second featuring actors Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn discussing ""The Rules"" of wedding crashing. Likewise ""The Rules of Wedding Crashing"" are presented in text format with all the rules discussed by the main characters. The first featurette is the best and at under 12 minutes your attention won't wander. The second is a more traditional promotion piece. The third will make you wish you were dancing at someone's reception as your butt falls asleep. We also get trailers, a track listing for all the songs used in the film and music video by The Sights of the song ""Circus"". There's also DVD-ROM content allowing you to compare the script to the final film and some other goodies that will make your crashing experience perfect.We get two commentary tracks with stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn providing play-by-play on the film. Their commentary track is a bit less informative but funnier than director Dobkin's who focuses much more on the production challenges of the film itself. Together they represent the perfect commentary track with just the right amount of background information and irreverence.A delightful romantic comedy, ""Wedding Crashers"" took many by surprise earning its place among the top performers of 2005. Families should be warned, however, that ""Wedding Crashers"" isn't for everybody as it earned its R rating for sexual content. The unrated version features about 8 minutes of additional footage extending several scenes but honestly the theatrical version was just great the way it was.",5,Just when you thought it was safe to get married...,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,3663,"['Commitment', 'concept', 'elude', 'many', 'men', 'idea', 'taking', 'shower', 'working', 'out', 'Divorce', 'mediators', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'have', 'most', 'unusual', 'hobby', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'seeking', 'commitment', 'avoid', 'dreaded', 'band', 'gold', 'themselves-crashing', 'weddings', 'clever', 'duo', 'can', 'masquerade', 'friends', 'family', 'regardless', 'who', 'involved', 'When', 'Jeremy', 'daughter', 'Secretary', 'Treasury', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'John', 'do', 'old', 'Potomac', 'Two', 'Step', 'waltz', 'right', 'as', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'family', 'What', 'find', 'love', 'desire', 'family', 'as', 'nutty', 'fruit', 'cake', 'John', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Claire', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Jeremy', 'sister', 'Gloria', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'attractive', 'frightening', 'handful.A', 'genre', 'mishmash', 'buddy/romantic', 'comedy', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'necessarily', 'how', 'good', 'material', 'pretty', 'good', 'due', 'deft', 'talents', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'lead', 'roles', 'give', 'charming', 'performances', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'charming', 'rogues', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'became', 'biggest', 'comedy', 'summer', 'deservedly', 'so.Featuring', 'stellar', 'transfer', 'bright', 'detailed', 'designer', 'wedding', 'dress', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'looks', 'marvelous', 'edition', 'Using', 'seamless', 'branching', 'technique', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Gladiator', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Alien', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'original', 'R', 'rated', 'format', 'unrated', 'unrated', 'edition', 'little', 'eight', 'minutes', 'longer', 'primarily', 'consists', 'scene', 'extensions', 'images', 'are', 'vivid', 'bright', 'lively', 'colors', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'sort', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'analog', 'defects', 'are', 'nonexistent', '5.1', 'format', ""n't"", 'used', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'movie', 'are', 'nice', 'effects', 'placed', 'speakers', 'Dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'what', 'want', 'comedy.We', 'get', 'interesting', 'extras', 'here', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'featurettes', 'one', 'how', 'weddings', 'were', 'staged', 'movie', 'second', 'featuring', 'actors', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'discussing', 'Rules', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'Likewise', 'Rules', 'Wedding', 'Crashing', 'are', 'presented', 'text', 'format', 'rules', 'discussed', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'featurette', 'best', '12', 'minutes', 'attention', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wander', 'second', 'more', 'traditional', 'promotion', 'piece', 'third', 'will', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'dancing', 'someone', 'reception', 'butt', 'asleep', 'also', 'get', 'trailers', 'track', 'listing', 'songs', 'used', 'film', 'music', 'video', 'Sights', 'song', 'Circus', 'also', 'DVD-ROM', 'content', 'allowing', 'compare', 'script', 'final', 'film', 'other', 'goodies', 'will', 'make', 'crashing', 'experience', 'perfect.We', 'get', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'stars', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'providing', 'play-by-play', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'bit', 'less', 'informative', 'funnier', 'director', 'Dobkin', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'production', 'challenges', 'film', 'Together', 'represent', 'perfect', 'commentary', 'track', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'background', 'information', 'irreverence.A', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'took', 'many', 'surprise', 'earning', 'place', 'top', 'performers', '2005', 'Families', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'however', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'earned', 'R', 'rating', 'sexual', 'content', 'unrated', 'version', 'features', '8', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'extending', 'several', 'scenes', 'honestly', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'way', 'was']",N/A

I figured I'd at least get a nice, lowbrow, politically incorrect goofball comedy with a few good laughs in the mold of Old School and Anchorman, but instead Wedding Crashers turned out to be the kind of cynical, implausible, and overlong dead whale of a movie that's causing ever-greater dissatisfaction with Hollywood.  Padded out to a laughable running time of 119 minutes, this movie can't even be saved by the deliriously cute Rachel McAdams, which is saying something.  Obviously Wedding Crashers was designed to be a classic buddy comedy, but it only deserves that label if you think Black Sheep does as well.The movie starts out promisingly enough, as we see a pair of thirty-something divorce mediators (I think it says something that I don't even remember their names at this point) devoting their midyear weekends to going uninvited to weddings of various religions and ethnicities to pick up chicks, culminating in a few good lines and some nice gratuitious nudity.  It's all downhill from there, though, as a clever concept is ruined by humor that would cease to exist if it were any broader or more watered down.  There are a few good ideas to be found in the first half of the movie, notably with some of the ancillary characters: the crazed clingy girl, the evil alpha-male boyfriend, and the social-misfit brother all manage to provoke a few guffaws.  Ultimately, though, Wedding Crashers turns out to be some decent ideas in search of a movie.  Great comedies-Rushmore, Election, The Big Lebwoski, Swingers-have memorable main characters, interesting plots, and intelligent dialogue.  Weighed down by sitcom-level writing and a mailed-in lead performance by the talented Owen Wilson (Vince Vaughn isn't much better), Wedding Crashers boasts none of these things.Even worse, about halfway through, after a cryptic conversation between Vaughn and the underused Christopher Walken and an agonizing beach pattycake scene, the movie sells out and ventures into sappy relationship territory, turning into the most ghastly of all creations: a romantic comedy without the comedy.  Even the inevitable Will Ferrell cameo near the end isn't enough to redeem Wedding Crashers from the horrors witnessed in its final hour.  This movie was clearly trying to be all things to all people, making it sort of the cinematic equivalent of a John Mayer album: soulless, corporate, and irritatingly ingratiating.

944407,A15XXOVX6ZNNRO,B000BKVQRU,"William D. Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No...","[0, 3]","This is an excellent, funny, well-acted film and an above average DVD.  The Wedding Crashers is essentially two films: the first part, including the first few sequences, is a screwball comedy about two divorce mediators (played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) who crash weddings for fun.  However, by the end of the first act, the film is already into its transition into a second film, which is a more standard romantic comedy.  Fortunately, the transition is relatively seamless and both films are done exceptionally well.The premise is basically simple - after years of crashing weddings to pick up women, both Jeremy Grey (Vaughn's character) and John Beckwith (Wilson's) fall in love when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken).  Despite the inherently sleazy nature of their past crashes, you still root for John and Jeremy for a couple of reasons.  One key is that it is clear from the beginning that while they are ultimately crashing weddings to pick up girls, they are still adding something to the weddings by being the life of the party and getting everyone, from flower girls to grandmothers, to have a good time.  Second, John is portrayed as being over the whole crashing thing and as having pangs of doubt about taking advantage of people.  Finally, and likely most importantly, is that Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), with whom John falls in love, is involved with someone who is utterly despicable in every possible way (Zach Lodge, played by Bradley Cooper).Although long (128 minutes), Crashers is not an overly complex plot - ultimately, the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the audience gets what they want at the end.  The film is full of various innuendos and comments that the easily offended will find inappropriate (such as Grandma Cleary calling Eleanor Roosevelt a lesbian), and the Uncorked version has several more.  However, this is not gross-out humor, and at the end of the day if you are in to Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn type movies, you will find this uproariously funny and entertaining.The cast is absolutely superb from top to bottom.  Even small roles, such as the couple whose divorce John and Jeremy are mediating at the beginning, are played by relative heavyweights Rebecca de Morney and Dwight Yoakam.  Jane Seymour plays Mrs. Cleary, though her character mysteriously disappears midway through the film in one of the few hiccups in scriptwriting.  Christopher Walken plays the Secretary in a surprisingly subtle way, and Will Farrell makes an appearence near the end that is priceless.  Australian actress Isla Fisher, who plays Vaughn's love interest, is really good in her role as the sort-of stalker girlfriend, and is someone who looks like a rising star in Hollywood.The special features on this film include one commentary from the director and a separate commentary with Wilson and Vaughn.  While you will probably have a better feel for the film based on Director David Dobkin's commentary, Wilson and Vaughn are a riot to listen to as they swing from discussing the film to their high school teachers and that day's football scores.  One interesting bit from the commentaries is that you will find out that many of the film's best lines were ad libbed, which helps to explain why the film, particularly in its early stages, has so much energy.  There is also an extensive, albeit unnumbered, list of the rules of wedding crashing and several other small features.The bottom line is that this is a fun film that has screwball comedy for men and romantic comedy for women.  There are good special features and it is a diverting, if not particularly thought-provoking, way to spend two hours.",5,Two Movies in One,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,3710,"['excellent', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'DVD', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'essentially', 'two', 'films', 'first', 'part', 'including', 'first', 'few', 'sequences', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'two', 'divorce', 'mediators', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'crash', 'weddings', 'fun', 'However', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'already', 'transition', 'second', 'film', 'more', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Fortunately', 'transition', 'relatively', 'seamless', 'films', 'are', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'well.The', 'premise', 'basically', 'simple', 'years', 'crashing', 'weddings', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'Jeremy', 'Grey', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'John', 'Beckwith', 'Wilson', 'fall', 'love', 'when', 'crash', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Secretary', 'Treasury', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'inherently', 'sleazy', 'nature', 'past', 'crashes', 'still', 'root', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'couple', 'reasons', 'One', 'key', 'clear', 'beginning', 'are', 'ultimately', 'crashing', 'weddings', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'are', 'still', 'adding', 'something', 'weddings', 'being', 'life', 'party', 'getting', 'everyone', 'flower', 'girls', 'grandmothers', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Second', 'John', 'portrayed', 'being', 'whole', 'crashing', 'thing', 'having', 'pangs', 'doubt', 'taking', 'advantage', 'people', 'Finally', 'likely', 'most', 'importantly', 'Claire', 'Cleary', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'whom', 'John', 'love', 'involved', 'someone', 'who', 'utterly', 'despicable', 'possible', 'way', 'Zach', 'Lodge', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'long', '128', 'minutes', 'Crashers', 'not', 'overly', 'complex', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'bad', 'audience', 'what', 'want', 'end', 'film', 'full', 'various', 'innuendos', 'comments', 'easily', 'offended', 'will', 'find', 'inappropriate', 'such', 'Grandma', 'Cleary', 'calling', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'lesbian', 'Uncorked', 'version', 'several', 'more', 'However', 'not', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'end', 'day', 'are', 'Owen', 'Wilson-Vince', 'Vaughn', 'type', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'entertaining.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'top', 'bottom', 'Even', 'small', 'roles', 'such', 'couple', 'divorce', 'John', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'mediating', 'beginning', 'are', 'played', 'relative', 'heavyweights', 'Rebecca', 'Morney', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Mrs.', 'Cleary', 'character', 'mysteriously', 'midway', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'hiccups', 'scriptwriting', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Secretary', 'surprisingly', 'subtle', 'way', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'appearence', 'end', 'priceless', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'Vaughn', 'love', 'interest', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'sort-of', 'stalker', 'girlfriend', 'someone', 'who', 'rising', 'star', 'Hollywood.The', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'include', 'one', 'commentary', 'director', 'separate', 'commentary', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'feel', 'film', 'based', 'Director', 'David', 'Dobkin', 'commentary', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'riot', 'listen', 'swing', 'discussing', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'teachers', 'day', 'football', 'scores', 'One', 'interesting', 'bit', 'commentaries', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'many', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'were', 'ad', 'libbed', 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'particularly', 'early', 'stages', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'also', 'extensive', 'albeit', 'unnumbered', 'list', 'rules', 'wedding', 'crashing', 'several', 'other', 'small', 'features.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'fun', 'film', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'men', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'women', 'are', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'diverting', 'not', 'particularly', 'thought-provoking', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours']",N/A

But it also has an interesting love story that unfolds making this film much more than just a comedy.I was about to give this film four stars but gave it five because I just couldn't think of anything negative to say about it.",5,Nothing Bad to Say About This One,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,615,"['used', 'love', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'medicore', 'ones', 'lately', 'lost', 'interest', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'so', 'good', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'genre', 'movie', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'hook', 'up', 'women', 'going', 'weddings', 'uninvited', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone.The', 'film', 'lough-out-loud', 'funny', 'consistently', 'funny', 'beggining', 'end', 'also', 'interesting', 'love', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'comedy.I', 'was', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'gave', 'five', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'negative', 'say']",N/A

The Wedding crasher premise is amusing and pretty well laid out before we get to the romance part of the comedy. Owen Wilson does his Owen Wilson thing, which after more than a few films is getting old. Vince Vaughn is pretty good as his buddy, and is helped by the fact the film doesn't focus strictly on him. OK to pass some time with, but doesn't give you a lot to talk or think about when its over, unless of course, you're young, male and single and want to try to emulate the Wedding Crasher gig.The fact this was one of the top five grossing films of 2005 says more about the state of films being released currently than to the qulaity of what's contained here.",3,OK.......some fun,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,708,"['Attractive', 'leads', 'pretty', 'girls', 'Wedding', 'crasher', 'premise', 'amusing', 'pretty', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'get', 'romance', 'part', 'comedy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'thing', 'more', 'few', 'films', 'getting', 'old', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'pretty', 'good', 'buddy', 'helped', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'focus', 'strictly', 'OK', 'pass', 'time', ""n't"", 'give', 'lot', 'talk', 'think', 'when', 'course', ""'re"", 'young', 'male', 'single', 'want', 'try', 'emulate', 'Wedding', 'Crasher', 'gig.The', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'grossing', 'films', '2005', 'more', 'state', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'currently', 'qulaity', 'what', 'contained', 'here']",N/A
