812039,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0001NECQE,Alex Udvary,"[5, 5]","I actually think Many Moore is a good actress. In time, many of you may come to agree with me, if you don't already. In the film &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; I thought she was absolutely wonderful. In her next project &quot;How to Deal&quot;, I thought Mandy was good in it, but the movie was one of the worst films of 2003. It was a werid hybrid. I wasn't sure if it wanted to be a drama or a teen comedy. And because of that right there, that makes it a bad movie. Its intentions are not clear.But &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; is a nice recovery for Mandy Moore. This is the lighthearted, commerical, mainstream teen comedy we were expecting &quot;How to Deal&quot; to be. Not the depressing &quot;Crossroads&quot; carbon copy it turned out to be.&quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; mostly works because of its stars. In particular Mandy Moore. She just seems to glow on-screen. She has a very natural presence to her. And there are moments when this &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;-ish movie for the kiddies demonstrates Moore's ability.The movie has Moore playing Anna Foster, the President's daughter. And she is fed up with the secret service, consisting of Jeremy Piven and Annabella Sciorra, taking away her freedom and not allowing her to lead the life of a &quot;normal&quot; teenager. So Anna decides to somehow break away and have at least one day's worth of shall we say &quot;liberty&quot;?She soon finds herself in the company of Mathew Goode, a British photographer. And the two go on a &quot;mad cap&quot; adventure.As I watched the first say hour of the film I enjoyed it. I thought it was light and breezy but after a while I just got a little tired of it. I wonder if the film could have been shorten? If it could avoid some of the cliches.Even though the movie admittedly has problems, it's still worth being seen by certain audiences. Mostly the younger teen crowd or Mandy Moore fans. It's fun to watch if you can get past its faults. Luckily I did.Bottom-line: Fun if not predictable teen comedy, but still worth while. Mandy Moore makes a nice recovery after the awful &quot;How to Deal&quot; and displays a large amount of star power.",3,"Fun, but too bad they didn't &quot;Chase&quot; after a better script",1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,2147,"['actually', 'think', 'Many', 'Moore', 'good', 'actress', 'time', 'many', 'may', 'come', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'film', 'quot', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'quot', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'next', 'project', 'quot', 'How', 'Deal', 'quot', 'thought', 'Mandy', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'films', '2003', 'was', 'werid', 'hybrid', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'be', 'drama', 'teen', 'comedy', 'right', 'there', 'bad', 'movie', 'intentions', 'are', 'not', 'clear.But', 'quot', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'quot', 'nice', 'recovery', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'lighthearted', 'commerical', 'mainstream', 'teen', 'comedy', 'were', 'expecting', 'quot', 'How', 'Deal', 'quot', 'be', 'Not', 'depressing', 'quot', 'Crossroads', 'quot', 'carbon', 'copy', 'turned', 'out', 'be.', 'quot', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'quot', 'mostly', 'stars', 'particular', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'just', 'glow', 'on-screen', 'very', 'natural', 'presence', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', '-ish', 'movie', 'kiddies', 'Moore', 'ability.The', 'movie', 'Moore', 'playing', 'Anna', 'Foster', 'President', 'daughter', 'fed', 'up', 'secret', 'service', 'consisting', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'taking', 'away', 'freedom', 'not', 'allowing', 'lead', 'life', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'teenager', 'So', 'Anna', 'somehow', 'break', 'away', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'day', 'worth', 'shall', 'say', 'quot', 'liberty', 'quot', 'soon', 'company', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'British', 'photographer', 'two', 'go', 'quot', 'mad', 'cap', 'quot', 'watched', 'first', 'say', 'hour', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'light', 'breezy', 'while', 'just', 'got', 'little', 'tired', 'wonder', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shorten', 'could', 'avoid', 'cliches.Even', 'movie', 'admittedly', 'problems', 'still', 'worth', 'being', 'seen', 'certain', 'audiences', 'Mostly', 'younger', 'teen', 'crowd', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'fans', 'fun', 'watch', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'faults', 'Luckily', 'did.Bottom-line', 'Fun', 'not', 'predictable', 'teen', 'comedy', 'still', 'worth', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'nice', 'recovery', 'awful', 'quot', 'How', 'Deal', 'quot', 'large', 'amount', 'star', 'power']",N/A

Hollywood has to create some sort of chaos or intrigue in order to captivate the teen audience, and this is precisely what sells in this world right now.

She is the presidents daughter, and because of that her freedom is limited.  She gets a ride from a boy on a motorcycle, acts crazy, and the movie ends from there.

She has some drinks, gets drunk, exposes her bare ass, and the guy still falls in love with her.Obviously, it's a love story and the two do fall in love...The movie wasn't my favorite even though the male actor Matthew Goode looks good.

812044,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0001NECQE,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[5, 5]","This is such a fun movie! After seeing Mandy in &quot;How To Deal,&quot; I was a little hesitant about this movie. Don't get me wrong, Mandy is fantastic no matter what-- her screen presence is amazing, sincere, and every bit as great as those super famous A-list movie stars, but sometimes the film itself just isn't that good. &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; is a breath of fresh air for Mandy fans and film fans alike. It's less about plot and more about character, which is so great I wish Hollywood would embrace witty dialogue over a burning building.Mandy plays Anna Foster, daughter of the President. When her dad's &quot;secret servants&quot; ruin her lovely dinner date that she spent hours getting ready for, she rushes into the Oval Office declaring a little independence. They come to a truce-- When they are in Prague, she will get to attend a concert with just TWO agents, instead of the whole swarm. Unfortunately, you can't make the President promise anything, and when Anna learns that her dad did indeed send more agents than what they agreed, she hits the road with a hunky photographer. (Played by newcomer cutie Matthew Goode) So a massive chase ensues with the secret service attempting to  keep tabs on Anna as she gallivants through Europe, enjoying the freedom she so desperately wanted.There's alot to love about this movie-- Mandy is terrific, and Matthew Goode definitely delivers. There is also a cute side-story involving two agents, one played by the hilarious Jeremy Piven, who deserves much more screen time than he normally gets. Also-- some cool DVD features, including deleted scenes and bloopers (where we get plenty of Jeremy Piven!)

812054,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0001NECQE,David Hugaert,"[4, 4]","""Chasing Liberty"" is most likely to become a certifiable ""sleeper"" hit at the box office. James Foster, President Of The United States (Mark Harmon), has his hands full, trying to run a nation of almost 270 million people, while attempting to keep tabs on his daughter's personal and social life at the same time. Anna Foster (Mandy Moore) wants to experience a normal, everyday existence, but has great difficulty in escaping the Svengali-like hold her father and his staff of Secret Service personnel have on her (which would be considered tame even by Communist standards!). In order to keep track of her daughter's ""escape attempts"", President Foster (in addition to his SS staff) hires outside informants, two of which are an older man and a woman, with the other being a reserved, handsome British gentleman (Matthew Goode). Young agent Ben Calder ends up chasing Anna all across Europe - from Prague, to Venice, to Berlin, and Calder will do anything to keep the President's daughter within close range, attempting to keep her out of harm's way as a result. Will Cupid's arrow work its own little array of magic on this truly charming ""couple"" as well? The virtual potpourri of picture postcard scenarios makes ""Chasing Liberty"" a colossal picture worth checking out, as well as for the film's display of a solid cast (which includes Martin Hancock's jubilant and tactful performance as a cockneyed English tourist, armed with a charismatic wit, including a batch of Steve ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" Austin sticker decals (as monetary currency?!!?

The ante goes up even more when the father just so happens to be the President of the United States and is able to keep tabs on his offspring wherever she may wander!Such is the backdrop of this charming & refreshing Romantic Comedy.  It displays the frustration of a young girl (Mandy Moore) who is fed up with being followed everywhere she goes.  Her rebellious stage is juxtaposed with her dad's overbearing but loving concern for her safety.One of the nice things about this film is the subtle way in which it shows how both father & daughter are right....and how both father & daughter are wrong in their assumptions about the world.  The movie never takes a ""preachy"" tone, and to do so would have ruined the charm of the story.Mandy Moore is, in a word, adorable.  She has a warm and radiant camera presence and her charisma is what really puts this DVD over the top.  Had any other actress played her role I doubt if this would have scored more than 3 or maybe 4 stars.  Moore's persona by itself is worth the price of this DVD.So, if you're looking for a different kind of Romantic Comedy, this one might be worth a shot.

812059,AC9UO8H2VCZI2,B0001NECQE,Dwayne A. Day,"[5, 5]","As a mid-30s guy, I'm not the intended audience for this film, but I was pleasantly surprised by it and cannot understand why the critics were not more kind to this movie.  Chasing Liberty was a nice re-telling of the classic Audrey Hepburn movie Roman Holiday in a modern setting and although it was clearly aimed at the late teen girl demographic, it is clever enough to appeal to older audiences as well.  Certainly both stars were comfortable with their roles (and I agree that Mandy Moore may have a future in more sophisticated movies).  But I also thought that the plot held together remarkably well and there were several clever and subtle touches that I did not expect from this movie.Other reviews on this site have detailed the plot, so I will not repeat that here.  I will mention two aspects of the film that I thought were intelligent and surprising.Throughout much of the film Mandy Moore's character (as Anna Foster, the president's daughter) whines about being freed of the shackles of her Secret Service detail.  She feels like she has been sheltered her entire life and wants to experience all of the things that other teenagers do.  The whining does get a little annoying at times, but it does make sense and her character is so likeable that it never goes too far.  (One surprise is something that does _not_ happen in this movie--there is no subplot involving kidnappers or foreign agents trying to take her hostage.  That would have degenerated into stupidity and cliche very fast, and probably would have seemed too ominous given the realities of modern politics.)But the movie is smart enough never to completely take Anna's side in this.  Near the end she is at a rock concert where some Americans recognize her and accost her.  Things quickly get out of control and she is knocked down, but Ben, the Secret Service agent who she has been traveling with, rushes in and saves her and then delivers her to a helicopter.  He tells her that she's safe, demonstrating what he was there for all along.  The movie thus makes the point--without heavy-handed dialogue or gun-play--that she really does need somebody to watch over her.  She is in danger not simply from terrorists or obvious threats, but from members of the public who recognize who she is and want to take out their frustrations on her.  It was a clever solution because the normal cliche would be for Ben to rescue her from terrorists or take a bullet for her, but here he rescues her from some unruly drunks.After this, we see her being more friendly with the Secret Service agents who she knows are there to protect her.  At the very end of the movie, when Anna once again talks about &quot;escaping&quot; from her Secret Service detail, it's clear that she doesn't really mean it.  She rides off with her guards safely behind.  It is not a major plot point, but it demonstrates a certain level of maturity for her character.I also enjoyed the romantic ending because the writers did their best to avoid a cliche while still giving the audience what they wanted.  Of course everyone wants her to end up with Ben.  But the movie made clear that this did not happen immediately.  Their parting in Berlin and then their reuniting in London clearly happened at least five or six months apart.  She went off to school, obviously gaining some life experience in the process, and then made the decision to seek him out.  (It is worth noting that given their age differences--Anna is supposed to be 18 and Ben is supposed to be 23--it makes sense for her to gain a little perspective before rushing off to him.  She has to decide if she really wants the older guy as opposed to the people surrounding her in college.)  Once again the director used some subtle cues to indicate that she had matured a bit.  Nothing major, but a soft touch with the writing that I found unexpected.It was a bit of a surprise that it was her going to him.  The typical cliche in romantic movies is for the guy to show up at the woman's door, telling her he cannot live without her.  But in many ways this ending made more sense.  After all, she was mad at him and it was really up to her to make the &quot;grand gesture&quot; as they called it.  There was no way that he could have simply headed over to Harvard and dropped in on her.  It was a sweet way to end the film without resorting to tired cliches.Like I said, this was a pleasant film.  I've watched a lot of junk on DVD lately, but this was surprisingly better than I expected and leads me to believe that Mandy Moore has a promising career ahead of her.",4,A nice re-telling of Roman Holiday,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,4573,"['mid-30s', 'guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'intended', 'audience', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'critics', 'were', 'not', 'more', 'kind', 'movie', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'was', 'nice', 're-telling', 'classic', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'movie', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'modern', 'setting', 'was', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'late', 'teen', 'girl', 'demographic', 'clever', 'enough', 'appeal', 'older', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'Certainly', 'stars', 'were', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'agree', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'may', 'have', 'future', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'movies', 'also', 'thought', 'plot', 'held', 'together', 'remarkably', 'well', 'were', 'several', 'clever', 'subtle', 'touches', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'movie.Other', 'site', 'have', 'detailed', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'here', 'will', 'mention', 'two', 'aspects', 'film', 'thought', 'were', 'intelligent', 'surprising.Throughout', 'much', 'film', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'Anna', 'Foster', 'president', 'daughter', 'being', 'freed', 'shackles', 'Secret', 'Service', 'detail', 'been', 'sheltered', 'entire', 'life', 'experience', 'things', 'other', 'teenagers', 'do', 'whining', 'get', 'little', 'annoying', 'times', 'make', 'sense', 'character', 'so', 'likeable', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'One', 'surprise', 'something', '_not_', 'happen', 'movie', 'subplot', 'involving', 'kidnappers', 'foreign', 'agents', 'trying', 'take', 'hostage', 'would', 'have', 'degenerated', 'stupidity', 'cliche', 'very', 'fast', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'too', 'ominous', 'given', 'realities', 'modern', 'politics', 'movie', 'smart', 'enough', 'never', 'completely', 'take', 'Anna', 'side', 'end', 'rock', 'concert', 'where', 'Americans', 'recognize', 'accost', 'Things', 'quickly', 'get', 'control', 'knocked', 'down', 'Ben', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'been', 'traveling', 'rushes', 'then', 'helicopter', 'safe', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'was', 'there', 'along', 'movie', 'thus', 'point', 'heavy-handed', 'dialogue', 'gun-play', 'really', 'need', 'somebody', 'watch', 'danger', 'not', 'simply', 'terrorists', 'obvious', 'threats', 'members', 'public', 'who', 'recognize', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'out', 'frustrations', 'was', 'clever', 'solution', 'normal', 'cliche', 'would', 'be', 'Ben', 'rescue', 'terrorists', 'take', 'bullet', 'here', 'unruly', 'drunks.After', 'see', 'being', 'more', 'friendly', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'protect', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Anna', 'once', 'again', 'talks', 'quot', 'escaping', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Service', 'detail', 'clear', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'guards', 'safely', 'not', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'certain', 'level', 'maturity', 'character.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'romantic', 'ending', 'writers', 'did', 'best', 'avoid', 'cliche', 'still', 'giving', 'audience', 'what', 'wanted', 'course', 'everyone', 'end', 'up', 'Ben', 'movie', 'made', 'clear', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'immediately', 'parting', 'Berlin', 'then', 'reuniting', 'London', 'clearly', 'happened', 'least', 'five', 'six', 'months', 'apart', 'went', 'school', 'obviously', 'gaining', 'life', 'experience', 'process', 'then', 'made', 'decision', 'seek', 'out', 'worth', 'noting', 'given', 'age', 'differences', 'Anna', 'supposed', 'be', '18', 'Ben', 'supposed', 'be', '23', 'sense', 'gain', 'little', 'perspective', 'rushing', 'off', 'decide', 'really', 'older', 'guy', 'opposed', 'people', 'surrounding', 'college', 'Once', 'again', 'director', 'used', 'subtle', 'cues', 'indicate', 'had', 'matured', 'bit', 'Nothing', 'major', 'soft', 'touch', 'writing', 'found', 'unexpected.It', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'was', 'going', 'typical', 'cliche', 'romantic', 'movies', 'guy', 'show', 'up', 'woman', 'door', 'telling', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'many', 'ways', 'ending', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'was', 'mad', 'was', 'really', 'up', 'make', 'quot', 'grand', 'gesture', 'quot', 'called', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'headed', 'Harvard', 'dropped', 'was', 'sweet', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'resorting', 'tired', 'cliches.Like', 'said', 'was', 'pleasant', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'junk', 'DVD', 'lately', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'better', 'expected', 'believe', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'promising', 'career', 'ahead']",N/A

She feels boxed in and lonely, especially when all the tension the security guards create scares off her dates. On a diplomatic trip to Prague with her President father, Anna decides to cut loose, and runs away from the security. She runs into Ben (Matthew Goode), a handsome young British fellow who tags along after her as she heads to Venice, then to Austria, then to Berlin. He's charming, and an attraction forms in the midst of their European escapades, but Ben has a secret that might come in between them. This film is something of a double romantic comedy, for while Moore and Goode's characters are falling in love, so too are the two security guards in hot pursuit of her, which I thought was interesting.It's pretty standard as far as romantic comedies go. You do get to see a fair bit of Europe, which is nice. Mandy Moore is cute as Anna, and Matthew Goode is charming as Ben, and Mark Harmon makes a likeable President. Not much more to say really. It's all pretty typical.Special features include a commentary with Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode, a featurette about the European locations (along with some travel tips from Mandy), full footage of the Roots concert used in the Prague nightclub scene, a montage of additional scenes, a gag reel (of unused improvs by the two pursuing security guards) and the original theatrical trailer.A reasonable romantic comedy, even if it isn't the most memorable.",3,Chasing Liberty?

812064,A10BWW5GU19AD,B0001NECQE,Jeff Wiley,"[3, 3]","Let me start my review by stating that I think Mandy Moore is actually a wonderful talent. She has the voice of an angel, the beauty of a model, and acting chops that, while still being honed, show tremendous promise. Her performances in ""How To Deal"", and moreover in ""A Walk To Remember"" showcase that of a young lady who will, hopefully, be entertaining audiences for many years to come. Many people will discount this movie because of her bubblegum pop music past; they should not.The film largely takes place with a European backdrop, including some great scenery. The soundtrack was also well chosen, and had some familiar songs, as well as new songs that fit the mood of the scenes that they were in. In terms of the acting, I feel as if I graded this movie fairly. Mark Harmon and newcomer Matthew Goode turn in solid efforts. No one should be expecting the words ""Chasing Liberty"" to follow the words ""...and the Oscar goes to"", but most people realize that, and will appreciate this movie for what it is : a fun, light-hearted picture.This movie is nothing terribly original, but it has some new premises, and even a couple of twists throughout the movie that should keep you interested. There are also some funny, light-hearted moments that should evoke a chuckle or two from you.

812065,A3MYTCI0B72ETL,B0001NECQE,"joeysmom4ever ""D.""","[3, 6]","Mandy Moore did a great job in the movie, ""Saved!""  I rented this movie hoping that I would be pleased with her performance again.  But I was disappointed.  She played the same simplistic, All-American girl with a loud, angry edge that she did in Saved!  (Though I do not know which movie was created first.)In this case, her acting did not match the character of the first daughter, Anna.  This character was supposed to be a political child, raised in the ways of international relations and public diplomacy.But the character, Anna, had no style.  Mark Harmon pulled it together for his role as president, but I could *not* buy Mandy Moore as the first daughter.  Her manner of speaking was very unrefined.  (In fact, she mostly shouted her way through the role.)  She was not sophisticated.  She was supposed to a big fan of opera, but I could not believe it.  Nor could I believe she'd be the kind of person to speak in several languages.She had no pride.  Though completely rejected by her traveling mate, an undercover FBI agent, she continued to strip in front of him and throw herself at him.  What teen-becoming-a-woman would do that?  What man would find that attractive?  Why would she want him as her first?  Pretty unbeliavable scripting here.((Spoiler warning.)) Without any segue whatsoever, the Brit/FBI agent supposedly falls in love with her and then gives in to sex (to prevent her from having a one-night stand with GusGus, a strikingly handsome stranger?!!), sealing his fate of eithering getting fired or having to quit.At this point, I wanted to shut the movie off.  But I continued to watch.  Though any normal teen would have suffered a terrible depression after a horrible break-up, Anna's heart was a ""little broken"" and she went off to college, able even to handle being in the presence of a blossoming love between her now-appreciated body guards.  Hmmm...  pretty unbelievable maturity for a girl of eighteen.Then her father, the anti-boyfriend president who destroyed her dating experiences from the start, has a change of heart and prompts her reunion with her ex-FBI/lover.  Although the guy quit his job because he *had* to (or be fired), this movie tried to make it a romantic point-of-pride, a meaningful ""gesture.""  Ugh, so unbelievable.I was truly disappointed in this movie.  The sex between Anna and the FBI agent was not only unethical but also in poor taste.  Even though the audience was supposed to have some secret insight into the creep's heart, I saw nothing but a guy indulging in a one-night stand.  Really ridiculous.If you want to see a really charming love story, rent ""Roman Holiday.""",2,Role not suited to Mandy's style...,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2638,"['Mandy', 'Moore', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'Saved', 'rented', 'movie', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'pleased', 'performance', 'again', 'was', 'disappointed', 'played', 'same', 'simplistic', 'All-American', 'girl', 'loud', 'angry', 'edge', 'did', 'Saved', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'first', 'case', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'character', 'first', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'political', 'child', 'raised', 'ways', 'international', 'relations', 'public', 'diplomacy.But', 'character', 'Anna', 'had', 'style', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'pulled', 'together', 'role', 'president', 'could', '*not*', 'buy', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'first', 'daughter', 'manner', 'speaking', 'was', 'very', 'unrefined', 'fact', 'mostly', 'shouted', 'way', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'was', 'supposed', 'big', 'fan', 'opera', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'could', 'believe', ""'d"", 'be', 'kind', 'person', 'speak', 'several', 'languages.She', 'had', 'pride', 'Though', 'completely', 'rejected', 'traveling', 'mate', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'continued', 'strip', 'front', 'throw', 'What', 'teen-becoming-a-woman', 'would', 'do', 'What', 'man', 'would', 'find', 'attractive', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'first', 'Pretty', 'unbeliavable', 'scripting', 'here', 'Spoiler', 'warning', 'segue', 'whatsoever', 'Brit/FBI', 'agent', 'supposedly', 'love', 'then', 'sex', 'prevent', 'having', 'one-night', 'stand', 'GusGus', 'strikingly', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'sealing', 'fate', 'eithering', 'getting', 'fired', 'having', 'quit.At', 'point', 'wanted', 'shut', 'movie', 'continued', 'watch', 'normal', 'teen', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'depression', 'horrible', 'break-up', 'Anna', 'heart', 'was', 'little', 'broken', 'went', 'off', 'college', 'able', 'even', 'handle', 'being', 'presence', 'blossoming', 'love', 'now-appreciated', 'body', 'guards', 'Hmmm', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'maturity', 'girl', 'eighteen.Then', 'father', 'anti-boyfriend', 'president', 'who', 'destroyed', 'dating', 'experiences', 'start', 'change', 'heart', 'reunion', 'ex-FBI/lover', 'guy', 'quit', 'job', 'be', 'fired', 'movie', 'tried', 'make', 'romantic', 'point-of-pride', 'meaningful', 'gesture', 'Ugh', 'so', 'unbelievable.I', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'sex', 'Anna', 'FBI', 'agent', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'unethical', 'also', 'poor', 'taste', 'Even', 'audience', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'secret', 'insight', 'creep', 'heart', 'saw', 'nothing', 'guy', 'indulging', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Really', 'ridiculous.If', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'charming', 'love', 'story', 'rent', 'Roman', 'Holiday']",N/A

812074,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001NECQE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 12]","I know there was a movie made about the mad cap adventures of the President's son, namely the 1996 film &quot;First Kid,&quot; but for the most part Hollywood prefers stories in which the president has a daughter, whether you are talking comedies (1998's &quot;My Date with the President's Daughter&quot;) or dramas (this year's &quot;Spartan&quot;).  Of course the current president has twin daughters and the previous president had a daughter as an only child, so it is not like the idea is unrealistic.  But given that the president is flying from one daughter's college graduation to that of the other this week while the nation has military forces in several Middle Eastern countries, when &quot;The West Wing&quot; begins the season with one of the president's daughters kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists it makes me extremely nervous because surely there are real people out there in the real world thinking along similar lines.  Never before in the history of the Republic has being the daughter of the President of the United States been as dangerous as it is right now.If Anna Foster (Mandy Moore), the first daughter in the romantic comedy &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; 2004 lived in the real world she would have a decidedly different view of her life.  But for her the worst thing in the world is trying to have a &quot;normal&quot; date while still in high school.  That is pretty hard when the Secret Service lets her date drive through the White House gate but then trashes the flowers he brought looking for who knows what nefarious devices or biological entities.  Anna, whose code name is &quot;Liberty&quot; for ironic reasons that matter to the film but would never occur to the Secret Service, is not happy with her father (Mark Harmon), so she tries to wrangle a deal.  When the family goes to Prague for an economic summit she will get to hang out with Gabrielle (Beatrice Rosen), the daughter of the French ambassador and do normal teenage things with only two Secret Service agents, Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Morales (Annabella Sciorra).Despite the warnings of her mother (Caroline Goodall) never to make a deal with a politician, Anna believes her father will honor the deal, so when she discovers that she is having a good time once again surrounded by agents, she bolts from the place and hops on the back of the motorcycle with the good looking guy.  His name is Ben Calder (Matthew Goode), and he is only too happy to scurry Anna away from her watchers.  This is not only because she is a good-looking young woman with a nice smile, but also because he is also a Secret Servent agent (in other words, we are doing a version of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;).  It seems the President was thinking ahead for such circumstances and orders Calder to let Anna engage in her youthful acts of rebellion without ever telling her the truth.The rest of &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; should be clear to you at this point.  Even the bickering between agents Weiss and Morales is rather predictable in how it will play out as well.  However this film has a couple of things going in its favor.  First, there are the European locations.  Anna and Ben travel from Prague to Berlin, via Venice no less, so if young women watching the film never want to be the daughter of the President a trip to Europe will surely be high on their list.  Second, Moore and Calder have good chemistry going for them.  She can go skinny-dipping in the Danube and still be a sweet girl while he actually seems smart enough to take care of them while they are running around central Europe.Along the way they meet the sort of interesting people you expect to find on the continent.  There is a hippie type named McGruff (Martin Hancock) who has a rather neat idea for spreading happiness around the world and a gondolier wannabe (Joseph Long) who gets to help out our young couple.  Of course with many of these adventures you keep waiting for the Secret Service side of Ben to come through and stop Anna from doing some of the things she does, but where would be the fun in that?  Moore is enticing enough to keep rooting for her throughout the film and forgive many of the film's problems, but then we get to the finish.A good finish can forgive a great many cinematic sins.  The past couple of months I have been comparing the endings of a lot of films to that of &quot;Uptown Girls,&quot; by no means a classic film, but with an effective conclusion that brought together a whole bunch of plot elements.  &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; sets up the opportunity for some sort of grand romantic gesture at the end, but aside from an interesting duet version of the operatic aria &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; there is nothing special here and there should have been.  Moore, who is going to be acting long after most of the rest of the current crop of young singers turned actresses are on the &quot;Whatever happened to?&quot; list, carries most of this film by herself, with Goode helping when the story allows, but in the end the script should have helped her bring this film home.",3,Good chemistry between the stars but a weak script and end,1085356800,"05

While the movie is simple, light-hearted and never controversial, the viewing experience was different each time.  Upon first viewing it, I left the movie theater ultimately unaffected.  The movie was cute...pleasant...non-affecting.  I went home, wrote the review and essentially forgot about the film altogether.  What I thought the film did was please a large crowd of teenagers and soccermoms who wanted a night out, free of the trappings of modern cinema.  Matthew Goode is also mesmerizing.  He has an obvious presence and amidst some robotic acting, he was the most natural presence in the movie.  Again...this film, upon first viewing, was a throwaway--nowhere near as bad as a large amount of crap that is sweeping the nation's theaters, but not good enough to warrant any accolades.Upon second viewing, I noticed more of the flaws...the awkward acting, the forced plot and the stock mold for romantic comedies, utilized all too often in Hollywood cinema.  Technically, the viewing experience was not as pleasing.

It's when you're young and you want to be rescued by a prince. Tell me a girl who didn't have that daydream, and I'll tell you she's lying.It's a surprisingly good movie despite the fact it has Mandy Moore in it. (And she doesn't sing!) For once, she's got a good role, and she works in that kinda role. And she has a decent hairstylist & makeup artist in this. Her hair's a reasonably good colour (although it darkens & lightens throughout the film), and although she likes to strip off, give credit to her, she has a body that will have most guys drooling over.Mandy Moore & the other guy are one of the most nauseatingly good looking couples I've seen. They're just too good-looking to be together. So expect to be reaching for the sick bag during this.The support cast around them are good as well, although there's a guy from Coronation Street in it (good lord), and the fabulous Annabella Sciorra! The rest of them are a cast of familiar faces you'll be itching to work out where they come from.I recently watched First Daughter as well, just to compare, and I have to say, although I'm giving them both three stars (they're actually very different in terms of storyline), this one is far superior. Both have predictable storylines, the ending you'll guess in the first 10 minutes of the film, but it's a nice film to sit & relax to before you head off to work.There's lots of corny pop songs, storming off, lingering looks (although thankfully none of that cliched bumping into each other, and eyes meeting - that NEVER happens in real life), but I'm afraid Matthew Goode just doesn't do anything for me. Mind you, the guys don't normally do anything for me in these films anymore.I can see Mandy Moore following in the footsteps of Kate Hudson, she has that kinda air about her. As long as she doesn't do some stupid independant movie, or appear in a horror movie, her career should last.The extras are your fluffy rubbish, and the gag reel isn't even in a gag reel.

On this occasion, her obstacle to romance is the fact she is the President's daughter (Liberty being her Secret Service codename). So, at 18, on a trip to Europe, she escapes the secret service army protecting her, in order to experience real freedom. On the way, she enlists the help of a young English man Ben Calder, played by Mathew Goode. Her father secretly allows it, having decided that she needs to experience `controlled freedom', to get it out of her system. The safety net is that Ben Calder is actually a secret service agent the President has sworn to protect her, and never to reveal his identity.It's formulaic and undemanding - but in fact hits all the right notes to achieve success in its given genre. Mandy Moore is cute, although she comes across more as spoilt kid than object of sympathy. Mathew Goode plays the role with manner, accent and appeal all directly descended from the Hugh Grant school of acting. Parallel to the main plot, is the more unlikely, but rather funny and more enjoyable building of romance between the two agents who are chasing Liberty across Europe, played by the always worth watching Jeremy Piven, and Annabella Sciorra.The locations in Prague, Berlin, and especially Venice, make for some visual eye candy helping to maintain some interest for the non teenagers in the crowd.Guys will no doubt find this schmaltzy, but if you have to watch a chick flick, then this one is better than many out there.",3,Harmless and fun though unoriginal,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1545,"['Mandy', 'Moore', 'chick', 'flick', 'motions', 'again', 'cute', 'girl', 'romance', 'problems', 'occasion', 'obstacle', 'romance', 'fact', 'President', 'daughter', 'Liberty', 'being', 'Secret', 'Service', 'codename', 'So', '18', 'trip', 'Europe', 'secret', 'service', 'army', 'protecting', 'order', 'experience', 'real', 'freedom', 'way', 'help', 'young', 'English', 'man', 'Ben', 'Calder', 'played', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'father', 'secretly', 'having', 'decided', 'experience', 'controlled', 'freedom', 'get', 'system', 'safety', 'net', 'Ben', 'Calder', 'actually', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'President', 'sworn', 'protect', 'never', 'reveal', 'identity.It', 'formulaic', 'undemanding', 'fact', 'hits', 'right', 'notes', 'achieve', 'success', 'given', 'genre', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'cute', 'across', 'more', 'spoilt', 'kid', 'object', 'sympathy', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'role', 'manner', 'accent', 'appeal', 'directly', 'descended', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'school', 'acting', 'Parallel', 'main', 'plot', 'more', 'unlikely', 'rather', 'funny', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'building', 'romance', 'two', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'chasing', 'Liberty', 'Europe', 'played', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra.The', 'locations', 'Prague', 'Berlin', 'especially', 'Venice', 'make', 'visual', 'eye', 'candy', 'helping', 'maintain', 'interest', 'non', 'teenagers', 'crowd.Guys', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'schmaltzy', 'have', 'watch', 'chick', 'flick', 'then', 'one', 'better', 'many', 'there']",N/A

Unfortunately, I did not get enough of what I wanted and the rest of the film didn't impress.  As always, the President's child is shown to live in luxury and wants to get out and be adventurous...where have we heard that before?  Anyway, this dashing British fellow comes along at just the right time to help her escape her Secret Service detail (is that so easy under any scenerio?) and get her wish.

812085,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001NECQE,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","*1/2 In its basic premise, ""Chasing Liberty"" is a bit like a remake of ""Roman Holiday.""  All it's lacking is Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and the slightest trace of wit, charm or sophistication.  Mandy Moore plays Anna Foster, an 18-year-old girl who has discovered that being the daughter of the President of the United States can put quite a crimp in one's dating life.  While on a trip with her parents to Prague, Anna takes the opportunity to break free of her bonds, ditching the Secret Service agents who are hounding her every move.  Anna meets up with a handsome motorcycle rider who assists her in her escape.  The joke here is that - surprise, surprise - this man is actually an agent himself, assigned by her father to help keep his rebellious daughter in check.Every character in the film is a hopeless stereotype.  Although Mandy Moore might have some potential as an actress, the script here turns her into a typical teenage airhead with all the intellectual depth of a mindless ""reality show"" contestant.  Mark Harmon is stuck playing the President of the United States as an uptight, overprotective ninny who can't understand his daughter's need to break out of her ""prison"" and experience life in the real world.  Caroline Goodall is Anna's preposterously understanding mother, who is completely unfazed by any of her daughter's outrageous behavior including getting rip-roaring drunk with the full consent of the man who has ostensibly been put in charge of looking out for her welfare, and swimming naked in the Danube in plain sight of a restaurant full of gawking patrons.  Jeremy Piven and Annabella Sciorra get the most thankless assignment of all, playing two bickering Secret Service agents whose job it is to hide in the shadows and provide witless running commentary on both Anna's activities and their own dysfunctional, love/hate relationship.Andy Cadiff's directorial ""style"" consists of having his characters cavorting in scenic European locales while pop tunes play relentlessly on the soundtrack.You know you're in trouble when a film starts off with one of those cutesy montage sequences in which a character poses in front of a mirror while, through the miracle of editing, a dozen or so smart and trendy outfits appear on her in rapid succession.

The plot of the story actually was quite interesting and seemed to have potential of developing into something fun. However, I think what ruined this movie was Mandy Moore's poor performance as the lead character, Anna. I bet when she was making the movie, she thought she was just making another teen movie where she had to portray another grounded angry teenage girl. But no, she was actually portraying a President's daughter. Yeah, there is a difference and she failed to see it. That was what didn't make this movie stand out and unique.

So, I decided to take a risk on this film. The previews made the film look wonderful. I am not a fan of Mandy Moore, but this did look like a good movie.So, I took the plunge. Well...let's just say that I wish I could dry myself after this ridiculous movie.The situation starts off with Anna Foster, overprotected daughter of the President of the United States (played (lol) by Mark Harmon of all folks). After a date that goes horribly wrong when the Secret Service agents assigned to protect her mistake an innocent gesture by her dates friends. They think he is reaching for a gun when in actuality he is reaching for a camera.Anna craves freedom and senses an oppurtunity on an upcoming diplomatic trip to Prague. Strangely, the President takes his daughter and wife along...making this a family visit. During the trip, Anna meets up with a prominent diplomatic daughter, who is definitely wild and crazy. She introduces Anna to the hip and happening Prague party scene. At the party, Anna meets Ben, who seems to be a free wheeling Euro guy. But, he is actually a Secret Service agent assigned to protect her.Okay, so you got the plot. Basically this movie is nothing but a modern day Roman Holiday. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any of the flair. Anna whines throughout the movie. Ben is typically a stoic English man, but they don't have an ounce of chemistry. Though, don't get me wrong. He is good lucking.Ultimately, the movie was really bad. I kept watching because I was too sleeply to turn it off. That should tell you something.

812093,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0001NECQE,Sean Pasek,"[0, 1]","""Chasing Liberty"" is one of those little film that I pulled up, hoping for something light and fun to watch.  This movie fulfills both of these things.  ""Chasing Liberty"" may not be the best romantic comedy you have ever seen, but it certainly does the job, and it's much better than most of the fluff that I have seen in recent years.It's almost ironic that ""Chasing Liberty"" borrows a few parallel ideas from, perhaps the best romantic film of all-time; or at least, one of the best: Roman Holiday.  Roman Holiday tells the story of a princess who just wants to get out for some time to herself and to forget, at least for a short while, that she is a princess.  Here, we have Anna Foster, the First Daughter, who can't go anywhere or do anything without the constant presence of the secret service.  I don't think many of us realize what a burden it must be, to be the child of a president.Anna is a young college student who has the opportunity to go to Prague to join a friend for a concert.  She negotiates with her father to have only two secret servicemen present.  When she discovers that she is being shadowed by a whole contingent of secret service, Anna rebelliously decides that she has had enough, and decides to treat herself to some time and some fun.Enter Ben Calder, who appears to be a mere British tourist also visiting Prague.  Anna quickly drafts him to help her elude the secret servicemen.  Little does Anna realize that Ben is secret service as well, but of course, he doesn't tell her that.  Remember when Gregory Peck, as the news reporter, decides not to tell Audrey Hepburn, the princess, who he is?Anna sets off on a wonderful adventure of self-discovery with Ben, who is doing his best to keep tabs on her, protect her, and not do the one thing that he knows he can't do: fall in love with her.  After all, he's operating under the President's direct orders.As we well know, there comes a point when two elements occur: Ben finally confesses his feelings for Anna, and Ben has to either tell Anna the truth about himself or she has to find out.Is the film a bit formulaic?  Yes, but the journey is so sweet and enjoyable, that as a viewer, I didn't mind so much.  The story is good, but it's really the performances of Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode that make the film work.Moore has a way of smiling that lights up every scene she is in.  She also gives Anna a bit of innocence and naivety that also makes her character appealing.  She hasn't experienced many things in life because of the constant presence of the secret service.  She mentions that she had to endure this for eight years when her father was a governor, prior to his becoming the President.Goode, on the other hand, plays Agent Calder in a tight and toned-down way.  After all, he's secret service, so he can't be too loose.  And yet, his character is appealing as well.  Anna is anxious for new experiences, and Calder is resisting as much as possible.  With this combination, we know that it is only a matter of time before one of them gives in (and we know which one will).Still, the joy of a film like this is in the journey.  I think most viewers will be able to easily predict what will ultimately happen.  We've seen enough films like this one to know.One standout performance that adds even more fun to this film is Jeremy Piven's Agent Alan Weiss.  He almost steals this film with the hilarious ways he tries to pick up on his partner, Agent Cynthia Morales.  Piven has a comedic ability, which he has shown frequently in other films, that is funny and endearing at the same time.So, if you're in the mood for a fun story, great characters, and some romance with the backdrop of several European cities, then you really can't go wrong with this little gem.  And, if you have never seen ""Roman Holiday"" then that should be your top priority!",4,"A Fun and Charming ""Roman Holiday""-Like Film!",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,3847,"['Chasing', 'Liberty', 'one', 'little', 'film', 'pulled', 'up', 'hoping', 'something', 'light', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'things', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'job', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'fluff', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years.It', 'almost', 'ironic', 'Chasing', 'Liberty', 'few', 'parallel', 'ideas', 'perhaps', 'best', 'romantic', 'film', 'all-time', 'least', 'one', 'best', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'story', 'princess', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'time', 'herself', 'forget', 'least', 'short', 'while', 'princess', 'Here', 'have', 'Anna', 'Foster', 'First', 'Daughter', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'do', 'anything', 'constant', 'presence', 'secret', 'service', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'realize', 'what', 'burden', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'child', 'president.Anna', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'opportunity', 'go', 'Prague', 'join', 'friend', 'concert', 'father', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'secret', 'servicemen', 'present', 'When', 'being', 'shadowed', 'whole', 'contingent', 'secret', 'service', 'Anna', 'rebelliously', 'had', 'enough', 'treat', 'time', 'fun.Enter', 'Ben', 'Calder', 'who', 'be', 'mere', 'British', 'tourist', 'also', 'visiting', 'Prague', 'Anna', 'quickly', 'drafts', 'help', 'elude', 'secret', 'servicemen', 'Little', 'Anna', 'realize', 'Ben', 'secret', 'service', 'as', 'well', 'course', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Remember', 'when', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'news', 'reporter', 'not', 'tell', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'princess', 'who', 'Anna', 'off', 'wonderful', 'adventure', 'self-discovery', 'Ben', 'who', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'tabs', 'protect', 'not', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'fall', 'love', 'operating', 'President', 'direct', 'orders.As', 'well', 'know', 'point', 'when', 'two', 'elements', 'occur', 'Ben', 'finally', 'feelings', 'Anna', 'Ben', 'tell', 'Anna', 'truth', 'find', 'out.Is', 'film', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'Yes', 'journey', 'so', 'sweet', 'enjoyable', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'good', 'really', 'performances', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'make', 'film', 'work.Moore', 'way', 'smiling', 'up', 'scene', 'also', 'Anna', 'bit', 'innocence', 'naivety', 'also', 'character', 'appealing', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'many', 'things', 'life', 'constant', 'presence', 'secret', 'service', 'had', 'endure', 'eight', 'years', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'governor', 'prior', 'becoming', 'President.Goode', 'other', 'hand', 'Agent', 'Calder', 'tight', 'toned-down', 'way', 'secret', 'service', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'loose', 'yet', 'character', 'appealing', 'as', 'well', 'Anna', 'anxious', 'new', 'experiences', 'Calder', 'resisting', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'combination', 'know', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'will', '.Still', 'joy', 'film', 'journey', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'easily', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'ultimately', 'happen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'films', 'one', 'know.One', 'standout', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'film', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Agent', 'Alan', 'Weiss', 'almost', 'film', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'pick', 'up', 'partner', 'Agent', 'Cynthia', 'Morales', 'Piven', 'comedic', 'ability', 'shown', 'frequently', 'other', 'films', 'funny', 'endearing', 'same', 'time.So', ""'re"", 'mood', 'fun', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'romance', 'backdrop', 'several', 'European', 'cities', 'then', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'little', 'gem', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'priority']",N/A
