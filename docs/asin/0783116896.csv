43987,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,0783116896,atmj,"[16, 24]","This movie is about unwanted pregnancies and the issue of abortion.  One in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s.  All affect people that live in the same house.  Demi Moore in the 1950's is a young widow, Sissy Spacek is an older mother in the 1970's and Anne Heche is a young college student in the 1990's.EACH PERSON'S STORY IS DIFFERENT:The story covers 3 women, who clearly have different reasons for not wanting to be pregnant.  All three women would find it difficult or near impossible to give up a child to adoption as well.  Only one was involved in a stable relationship.  Also, these are clearly not people who consider abortion or pregnancy lightly.  One clearly had strong feelings on the issue prior to becoming pregnant.KEY HERE IS THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO A CHOICE:In the 1950's there was none.  In the 1970s, information was still sparse.  However, even 30 years later in the 1990's, there still is a divided line.  It is clear this right is divided across religious or philosophical lines.  What concerns me, it that it is predominantly religious and our rights really should be clear in that direction.BOTH PRO-CHOICE AND PRO-LIFE SIDES WILL BE MOVED BY THIS MOVIE:Without spouting my own beliefs (too much), I feel this movie shows the issues fairly.  There are times when a pregnancy, is through no fault of the woman, truly unwanted.  Birth control methods fail.  It is not like the woman can just go on with their lives as normal, as can be seen in all of the episodes.  This is a life altering situation for each woman, for any woman.  Even if adoption were considered, there is still the 9 months and the uncertaintly as well as the stigma of giving up a child.  We've all heard of adoption horror stories.Also, the illusion of &quot;support&quot; after birth by the Right to life movement is a &quot;temporary&quot; solution for a long term commitment.WHAT I FOUND TO BE INTERESTING AND DOES NOT SET RIGHT WITH ME, was some of the Right to Life protestor's tactics.  This is also pertinent to this story as well.  Right to life should mean just that right to life for all parties.  Lets first start with those that are fully realized human beings.  I cannot understand how these Right to life enthusiasts can consider the &quot;rights&quot; of an unborn child and consider harming others in the same breath.  The logic escapes me.  This is not fiction in this sense, it happened 50 miles from where I live.  There is no justification if they truly believe in their philosophy.  Otherwise they are merely posers trying to control other's lives with their religious dogma.BASED ON THIS MOVIE AND MY OBSERVATIONS:This is a religious issue and our country provides for a separation of church and state.

While abortion is such a difficult issue and while I consider  myself to be pro-choice, I also feel I can see and understand some of the  pro-life arguments.

43989,A2GYX971VETQBV,0783116896,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[5, 7]","Alright...I'm not going to pretend that this film is unbiased.  It certainly is.  IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK is a powerful argument, divided amongst three independent segments, for providing a safe & secure means for women to seek abortions if they so choose.  In the first chapter, a women in the 1950s, cornered by guilt and shame, is forced to seek a back-alley abortion--a method that leaves her devastated.  The closing scene of this first chapter is absolutely horrific and a powerful argument for being pro-choice in and of itself.In the second chapter, set in the 1970s, the film tries to provide a balanced perspective on abortion by having the protagonist (a tired mother of five who has finally begun her own life again) choose to keep her child.  While it may have been intended as a half-argument for the pro-life side, it comes across as a martyr story.  The liberal audience will ignore her decision and wish that the mother were not so confined by her moral beliefs and indecision.The final chapter grants us a young female in the 1990s who comes across as a foolish girl, a girl who has become involved with her professor.  There's no real sympathy for this girl, but rather some anger at the professor's dismissive attitude.  No sympathy, that is, until the powerful scenes depicting the radical nature of the far-right of the pro-life movement.While this film may not be a ""balanced"" perspective on abortion, I believe that it does a nice job at humanizing the pro-choice movement.  IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK is not selling permiscuous sex without consequences.  Rather, it documents the hard-choices and horrible circumstances of unwanted pregnancy--a position that no one wants to be in.  In the end, the film delivers a powerful sentiment: One way or another, women are going to seek abortions.  They always have and always will.  Thus, we must ask ourselves if we should provide a safe & secure place for women to seek them.  My recommendation is for you to watch IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK a before you decide, regardless of your leanings.",4,A Powerful Argument for the Pro-Choice Camp,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2061,"['Alright', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'pretend', 'film', 'unbiased', 'certainly', 'THESE', 'WALLS', 'COULD', 'TALK', 'powerful', 'argument', 'divided', 'amongst', 'three', 'independent', 'segments', 'providing', 'safe', 'secure', 'women', 'seek', 'abortions', 'so', 'choose', 'first', 'chapter', 'women', '1950s', 'cornered', 'guilt', 'shame', 'forced', 'seek', 'back-alley', 'abortion', 'method', 'devastated', 'closing', 'scene', 'first', 'chapter', 'absolutely', 'horrific', 'powerful', 'argument', 'being', 'pro-choice', 'itself.In', 'second', 'chapter', 'set', '1970s', 'film', 'tries', 'provide', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'abortion', 'having', 'protagonist', 'tired', 'mother', 'five', 'who', 'finally', 'begun', 'own', 'life', 'again', 'choose', 'keep', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'half-argument', 'pro-life', 'side', 'martyr', 'story', 'liberal', 'audience', 'will', 'ignore', 'decision', 'wish', 'mother', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'confined', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'indecision.The', 'final', 'chapter', 'grants', 'young', 'female', '1990s', 'who', 'across', 'foolish', 'girl', 'girl', 'who', 'become', 'involved', 'professor', 'real', 'sympathy', 'girl', 'rather', 'anger', 'professor', 'dismissive', 'attitude', 'sympathy', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'radical', 'nature', 'far-right', 'pro-life', 'movement.While', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'abortion', 'believe', 'nice', 'job', 'humanizing', 'pro-choice', 'movement', 'IF', 'THESE', 'WALLS', 'COULD', 'TALK', 'not', 'selling', 'permiscuous', 'sex', 'consequences', 'Rather', 'documents', 'hard-choices', 'horrible', 'circumstances', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'position', 'one', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'powerful', 'sentiment', 'One', 'way', 'women', 'are', 'going', 'seek', 'abortions', 'always', 'have', 'always', 'will', 'Thus', 'must', 'ask', 'should', 'provide', 'safe', 'secure', 'place', 'women', 'seek', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'IF', 'THESE', 'WALLS', 'COULD', 'TALK', 'decide', 'regardless', 'leanings']",N/A

While the film did not change my views, it did force me to reexamine some of my thoughts on the subject.

That was a much more powerful and convincing way to get across their pro-choice message because I, as a viewer, did not feel judged for my own opinions.

43992,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0783116896,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 2]","When this film was first broadcast on HBO back in 1996, I found it quite compelling.  Yes, it had its less than subtle moments, but for a made-for-cable movie, it was pretty darn effective, I thought.  The anthology approach--three stories from three different eras in recent history (the 50s, the 70s and the mid-90s)--effectively portrayed the shift in attitudes toward abortion in the US over the past several decades and how its legalization has profoundly altered women's lives.  The film's occasional heavyhandedness was not unexpected, but the top flight cast seemed to overcome the script's occasional lapses into preachiness.  And overall, it seemed to reflect as balanced a treatment of a complex issue as you could possibly hope for (while definitely maintaining a &quot;pro-choice&quot; perspective throughout).Or so it seemed at the time.  On re-viewing the film recently, I found I had less patience with its flaws for some reason.  I have little argument with the pro-choice point of view being advanced by the film.  Indeed the film's message that such a choice is almost never anything but traumatic is a potent one and one that abortion rights opponents need always to keep in mind.But it doesn't invalidate the film's message to say that it probably could have been handled with more subtlety.  There are a number of moments in all three films that could have used a leavening touch, but I'll limit myself to one from the third installment (SPOILER WARNING): namely  the shoot-up in the clinic that serves as the film's climax.As someone else pointed out below, by the mid-90s most abortion clinics had metal detectors.  Gunmen outside the clinics remained a hazard, but there is no reported case of abortion providers getting shot on the premises (none that I am aware of anyway).  Yes, yes, there is such a thing as dramatic license, but when you're dealing with such an incendiary topic to begin with, it's hardly necessary to invoke it.WALLS remains worth watching, to be sure, but if I were to recommend just one film on the topic of abortion, this would probably not be the one.

I also found the 70s segemnt out of place in the sequel, but that's a different subject.The first segment, set in the 50s spoke to me the most. You could feel Demi's pain. I wanted to just strangle her sister. As I said before, the 70s segment was acted well, but lacked a moving story for me. I just didnt feel for Sissy's character like the other two.

43996,A3N2SZKSUQNS6F,0783116896,K. Downey,"[25, 27]","This trilogy of stories is both powerful and thought provoking. The movie follows the stories of three women of different eras who are conflicted regarding their unplanned pregnancies. While fictional in form, in reality it reflects the changing views and policies toward abortion from the 1950's to the present era.The setting of all three segments is in a single house. This masterful production/directorial technique seems to be symbolic for an issue which has always been controversial to many. As the house becomes more and more dilapidated over each segment, we also see that the right to abortion is becoming a compoundingly fragile right that could be taken away at any time.

Bernabo,"[3, 8]","""If These Walls Could Talk"" is one of the most didactic films you are likely to see, but given that there is no issue in contemporary America that is more polarizing than that of abortion it could well be that it is one of the least persuasive films you will see as well.  Those who are pro-choice will see it as compelling, while those who are pro-life will see it as offensive, and those who have not made up their minds are too young to watch anything that originally aired on HBO.  That is especially true of this film, which has a pair of scenes that will upset you regardless of gender or ideology.The conceit of ""If These Walls Could Talk"" is that three women, living in three different times in the past half-century but in the same house, find themselves pregnant.  Each faces a different situation, both personally and in terms of the legal and social climate regarding abortion.  In 1952, Claire Donnelly (Demi Moore) is a young nurse whose husband had been killed in Korea.  She has a moment of weakness and when she discovers she is pregnant she desperately tries to find someone who can perform an illegal abortion.  In 1974, Barbara Barrows (Sissy Spacek) is a mother of four older children who has started work on a college degree when she finds herself pregnant.  This baby means no early retirement for her husband and that their oldest daughter can forget about going to the college of her choice, so Barbara considers a legal abortion.  In 1996, Christine Cullen (Anne Heche) learns she is pregnant by her married college professor.  Christine is considering an abortion and discovers the local clinic is besieged by anti-abortion protesters, with volunteers escorting women inside past the gauntlet.What I find interesting about ""If These Walls Could Talk"" is the way that the writers have dressed up their rhetoric.  The death of each person in this movie, whether they are born or unborn, is tragic because death is inherently tragic, and there is certainly an extent to which you can read things both ways in this 1996 movie.  After all, the death of a woman because of a ""back alley"" abortion can be seen as an argument for making abortion legal so that it does not happen, but it also serves as evidence for the idea that women should not have abortions in the first place.Yet in the total context of the movie the preferred reading for such a things seems clear.  Within that context the decision not to have an abortion is not just a pro-life decision, but a pro-choice one as well (to wit, she chooses life).  Plus, we see a world where the people who carry guns and placards are fanatics in the crazy sense of the word instead of the deeply devote meaning.  There are two sides to the issue, and in each vignette those two sides are represented, and the common denominator is that the side that is most judgmental is the side that loses in each instance.  It is just that from a political perspective, one side of the dispute is inherently more judgmental than the other.",4,"A decidely rhetorical HBO movie, but unlikely to persuade anyone",1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,3001,"['Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', 'one', 'most', 'didactic', 'films', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'given', 'issue', 'contemporary', 'America', 'more', 'polarizing', 'abortion', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'persuasive', 'films', 'will', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'pro-choice', 'will', 'see', 'compelling', 'who', 'are', 'pro-life', 'will', 'see', 'offensive', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'minds', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'anything', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'especially', 'true', 'film', 'pair', 'scenes', 'will', 'upset', 'regardless', 'gender', 'ideology.The', 'conceit', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', 'three', 'women', 'living', 'three', 'different', 'times', 'past', 'half-century', 'same', 'house', 'find', 'pregnant', 'different', 'situation', 'personally', 'terms', 'legal', 'social', 'climate', 'regarding', 'abortion', '1952', 'Claire', 'Donnelly', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'young', 'nurse', 'husband', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Korea', 'moment', 'weakness', 'when', 'pregnant', 'desperately', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'perform', 'illegal', 'abortion', '1974', 'Barbara', 'Barrows', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'mother', 'four', 'older', 'children', 'who', 'started', 'work', 'college', 'degree', 'when', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'early', 'retirement', 'husband', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'can', 'forget', 'about', 'going', 'college', 'choice', 'so', 'Barbara', 'legal', 'abortion', '1996', 'Christine', 'Cullen', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'pregnant', 'married', 'college', 'professor', 'Christine', 'considering', 'abortion', 'local', 'clinic', 'besieged', 'anti-abortion', 'protesters', 'volunteers', 'escorting', 'women', 'gauntlet.What', 'find', 'interesting', 'Walls', 'Could', 'Talk', 'way', 'writers', 'have', 'dressed', 'up', 'rhetoric', 'death', 'person', 'movie', 'are', 'born', 'unborn', 'tragic', 'death', 'inherently', 'tragic', 'certainly', 'extent', 'can', 'read', 'things', 'ways', '1996', 'movie', 'death', 'woman', 'back', 'alley', 'abortion', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'argument', 'making', 'abortion', 'legal', 'not', 'happen', 'also', 'evidence', 'idea', 'women', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'abortions', 'first', 'place.Yet', 'total', 'context', 'movie', 'preferred', 'reading', 'things', 'clear', 'decision', 'not', 'have', 'abortion', 'not', 'just', 'pro-life', 'decision', 'pro-choice', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'wit', 'life', 'see', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'carry', 'guns', 'placards', 'are', 'fanatics', 'crazy', 'sense', 'word', 'instead', 'deeply', 'devote', 'meaning', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'issue', 'vignette', 'two', 'sides', 'are', 'represented', 'common', 'denominator', 'side', 'most', 'judgmental', 'side', 'instance', 'just', 'political', 'perspective', 'one', 'side', 'dispute', 'inherently', 'more', 'judgmental', 'other']",N/A

That was not a realistic depiction--she would have been screaming her head off.  I also wonder why a nurse would go through this, knowing the extreme risks and unsanitary conditions--I would find it more credible if the character's occupation had been changed to a nonmedical profession. Still, the scenes are indelible and very powerful, and a painful reminder of what women had to go through back in the fifties to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.The 1970s segment was an excellent illustration of how women are able to have a choice, and it is a reprieve from the more intense 1952 and 1996 segments.The 1996 segment depicts how the abortion issue has created strong divides within two college friends, played by Anne Heche and Jada Pinkett. Their difference is but a microcosm of the heated debate within communities at large over abortion, which has spawned demented extremists who think the only way to stop abortion is to kill the physicians who perform the procedure at the women's clinic.The viewer can see how far women have come over control of their own bodies, yet the 1996 segment is a painful reminder of how much things are going backwards, especially after hearing about the latest anti-abortion legislation passed in South Dakota, which even protects rapists.

44011,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,0783116896,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[33, 34]","Abortion&#65533;s current sound bite nature means that both sides of the debate forget the women wanting control of their own bodies--and lives.Graphically showing how government decisions impact private citizens, this film places women back into the center of this social issue. The audience is constantly reminded each of the women in the vignettes is a three-dimensional person with dreams and aspirations; only a callous person would believe women undertake abortions for fun.I have previously seen many horror movies, but nothing prepared me for grim ""1952"". Discovering she is pregnant, nurse Claire Donnelly tried to obtain a safe illegal abortion. Repeatedly suggesting death/mourning (ironically in a supposedly 'pro-life' era) Claire's world is intentionally drab and the frequently drawn curtains also convey secrecy and shame. The white nightgown worn on the night of her septic abortion made her already pale complexion even more ghostly. Watching this segment is still very hard, and sensitive viewers should not eat during this segment.Demonstrating a clear difference between pro-choice and pro-abortion personal belief systems, ""1974"" is the most complex segment. Non-traditional college student Barbara Barrows wants to have it all, but is not initially sure she wants another child or a newly legalized abortion procedure. Barrows is trying to be open minded about her gender's new possibilities (she uses her class to explore women's issues and reads Our Bodies Our Selves) but she is also wrestling with her cultural and generational conscience which saw abortion as taboo. I could have done without the one-dimensional portrayal of 'feminism' through Barrows's teen daughter (who believes abortion is the best option for all women) but overall thought this piece was essential to the abortion issue's political reality. Having the right to choose does not mean much if anybody on any side of the issue forces you into something you cannot live with.Maybe it's my generational experience, but ""1996"" was overwhelmingly cobbled from current headlines. Having seen the real-life clinic violence on my nightly news, I believed this piece was largely redundant. It was however interesting to see the difference between the robotically peaceful (but creepy) female anti-choice Clinic protestors and the inevitably psychopathic male protestor (who somehow was able to get into the procedures area). Obviously unable to afford many of the security measures used by real-life women's clinics (metal detectors) the fictional women's health clinic was ultimately besieged by a so-called 'silent type' instead of the loud protestors it had invested so much time and resources preparing against.The house itself is metaphor for the changing reproductive rights status:A) In 1952 the house/choice is dilapidated and has wasted potential. Although it could look nice, it is only half finished and (again) invokes hiding/shame.B) In 1974 the house/choice looks very put together and strong. This environment is inherently very nurturing and friendly. You really want the house/choice to stay in this condition forever.C)In 1996 the house/choice initially look okay, but closer inspection reveal time (state/federal legislation) has worn it down and unless somebody quickly intervenes, we are on our way back to 1952. The catch is that some people in my generation do not initially realize what a world without choice is really like. We take our reproductive rights for granted until we loose them.",4,Hauntingly memorable,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,3503,"['Abortion', '65533', 's', 'current', 'sound', 'bite', 'nature', 'sides', 'debate', 'forget', 'women', 'wanting', 'control', 'own', 'bodies', 'lives.Graphically', 'showing', 'how', 'government', 'decisions', 'impact', 'private', 'citizens', 'film', 'women', 'back', 'center', 'social', 'issue', 'audience', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'women', 'vignettes', 'three-dimensional', 'person', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'only', 'callous', 'person', 'would', 'believe', 'women', 'undertake', 'abortions', 'fun.I', 'have', 'previously', 'seen', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'nothing', 'prepared', 'grim', '1952', 'Discovering', 'pregnant', 'nurse', 'Claire', 'Donnelly', 'tried', 'obtain', 'safe', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'Repeatedly', 'suggesting', 'death/mourning', 'ironically', 'supposedly', ""'pro-life"", 'era', 'Claire', 'world', 'intentionally', 'drab', 'frequently', 'drawn', 'curtains', 'also', 'convey', 'secrecy', 'shame', 'white', 'nightgown', 'worn', 'night', 'septic', 'abortion', 'made', 'already', 'pale', 'complexion', 'even', 'more', 'ghostly', 'Watching', 'segment', 'still', 'very', 'hard', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'should', 'not', 'eat', 'segment.Demonstrating', 'clear', 'difference', 'pro-choice', 'pro-abortion', 'personal', 'belief', 'systems', '1974', 'most', 'complex', 'segment', 'Non-traditional', 'college', 'student', 'Barbara', 'Barrows', 'have', 'not', 'initially', 'sure', 'child', 'newly', 'legalized', 'abortion', 'procedure', 'Barrows', 'trying', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'gender', 'new', 'possibilities', 'class', 'explore', 'women', 'issues', 'reads', 'Bodies', 'Selves', 'also', 'wrestling', 'cultural', 'generational', 'conscience', 'saw', 'abortion', 'taboo', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'one-dimensional', 'portrayal', ""'feminism"", 'Barrows', 'teen', 'daughter', 'who', 'abortion', 'best', 'option', 'women', 'overall', 'thought', 'piece', 'was', 'essential', 'abortion', 'issue', 'political', 'reality', 'Having', 'right', 'choose', 'not', 'mean', 'much', 'anybody', 'side', 'issue', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'with.Maybe', 'generational', 'experience', '1996', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'cobbled', 'current', 'headlines', 'Having', 'seen', 'real-life', 'clinic', 'violence', 'nightly', 'news', 'believed', 'piece', 'was', 'largely', 'redundant', 'was', 'however', 'interesting', 'see', 'difference', 'robotically', 'peaceful', 'creepy', 'anti-choice', 'Clinic', 'protestors', 'inevitably', 'psychopathic', 'male', 'protestor', 'who', 'somehow', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'procedures', 'area', 'Obviously', 'unable', 'afford', 'many', 'security', 'measures', 'used', 'real-life', 'women', 'clinics', 'metal', 'detectors', 'fictional', 'women', 'health', 'clinic', 'was', 'ultimately', 'besieged', 'so-called', ""'silent"", 'type', 'instead', 'loud', 'protestors', 'had', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'resources', 'preparing', 'against.The', 'house', 'metaphor', 'changing', 'reproductive', 'rights', 'status', '1952', 'house/choice', 'dilapidated', 'wasted', 'potential', 'could', 'look', 'nice', 'only', 'half', 'finished', 'again', 'invokes', 'hiding/shame.B', '1974', 'house/choice', 'very', 'put', 'together', 'strong', 'environment', 'inherently', 'very', 'nurturing', 'friendly', 'really', 'want', 'house/choice', 'stay', 'condition', 'forever.C', '1996', 'house/choice', 'initially', 'look', 'okay', 'closer', 'inspection', 'reveal', 'time', 'state/federal', 'legislation', 'worn', 'down', 'somebody', 'quickly', 'intervenes', 'are', 'way', 'back', '1952', 'catch', 'people', 'generation', 'do', 'not', 'initially', 'realize', 'what', 'world', 'choice', 'really', 'like', 'take', 'reproductive', 'rights', 'granted', 'loose']",N/A

Everyone has their own opinion.Now that I have all of that aside, read on. The first and last segments were the best. They both had punch, got the message out, and were extremely powerful. They both showed how abortion really gets you nowhere, which is how I took it. The segment starring Sissy Spacek was the weakest, although there were great performances all around. Demi Moore, Diana Scarwid, and Cher were perfect.
