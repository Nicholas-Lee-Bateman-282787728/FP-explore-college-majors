I particularly enjoyed when Andre the servant was transported back in time & inflated like a balloon.  Malcom McDowell had a very colorful pair of boots!  The witchcraft-induced fantasy sequence at the feast was imaginative.  This film can capture a child's attention.  Mine usually wanders off disinterested, but watched it all. Jean Reno as Count Thibault of Malfete looks very French.  However, he's a bit tough to buy as a romantic lead opposite Christina Applegate.  I know he was signed because he starred in the French version, but the chemistry with Christina doesn't click, proof being Julia falls for a young cute attorney at the end who does catch her eye.  When Reno's transported to the future, there is no elegance of nobility.  Christian Clavier's antics of sitting on the floor of LaTour eating like a dog, skewering a raw chicken on an umbrella & roasting it in the fire, washing from the toilet, for me was over-the-top & not funny.  Matt Ross as the boyfriend Hunter cheats on Applegate with a beautiful blonde who writhes like a cat in heat on the tabletop.  This was unbelievable and tasteless.  We certainly believe when Julia breaks up with Hunter; but what did she see in him in the first place?  Malcom McDowell is a fine actor who walks through the paces of this half-baked farce.  The French countryside is beautiful.  Why the wizard transports the count to Chicago is a total mystery.

Anyone who enjoys comedy should see this on VHS or DVD.Medieval French knight Count Thibault is engaged to marry English Princess Rosalind. However, a rival, Earl of Warwick, schemes to have Thaibault bumped off so he can marry Rosalind instead. The Earl gets a potion from a witch that will cause whoever drinks it to have nightmarish hallusinations. The Earl's plan is to have Rosalind drink it, then see Thibault to be a monster and kill him. However, at the banquet something the Earl never expected happens: after tainting the Princess' cup without anyone eles knowing, Rosalind has Thibault drink from her cup while she drinks from his as a sort of romantic celebration, whitch causes Thibault to end up killing her. Thibault is thrown in the dungeon and sentenced to be executed the next morining, but he sends his manservant, Andre le Pate, to find an English wizard to try to find a way to set things right. Andre is able to bring one back in the nick of time, and the wizard devises a spell to open the gates of time. The plan is to send Thibault back a few hours to just before Rosalind was killed and prevent her death. However, this wizard proves to be rather absent-minded, and sends both Thaibault and Andre not back but forward-all the way to the year 2000!Be sure to check this one out!",5,Wonderful comedy/fantasy that suffered from lack of publicity,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1562,"['remember', 'seeing', 'exactly', 'one', 'preview', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'asked', 'several', 'people', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'belive', 'why', 'film', 'bombed', 'theaters', 'greatly', 'film', 'hilarious', 'Anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'should', 'see', 'VHS', 'DVD.Medieval', 'French', 'knight', 'Count', 'Thibault', 'engaged', 'marry', 'English', 'Princess', 'Rosalind', 'However', 'rival', 'Earl', 'Warwick', 'have', 'Thaibault', 'bumped', 'off', 'can', 'marry', 'Rosalind', 'instead', 'Earl', 'potion', 'witch', 'will', 'cause', 'whoever', 'have', 'nightmarish', 'hallusinations', 'Earl', 'plan', 'have', 'Rosalind', 'drink', 'then', 'see', 'Thibault', 'be', 'monster', 'kill', 'However', 'banquet', 'something', 'Earl', 'never', 'expected', 'happens', 'tainting', 'Princess', 'cup', 'anyone', 'eles', 'knowing', 'Rosalind', 'Thibault', 'drink', 'cup', 'sort', 'romantic', 'celebration', 'whitch', 'causes', 'Thibault', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'Thibault', 'thrown', 'dungeon', 'sentenced', 'be', 'executed', 'next', 'morining', 'manservant', 'Andre', 'le', 'Pate', 'find', 'English', 'wizard', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'Andre', 'able', 'bring', 'one', 'back', 'nick', 'time', 'wizard', 'spell', 'open', 'gates', 'time', 'plan', 'send', 'Thibault', 'back', 'few', 'hours', 'just', 'Rosalind', 'was', 'killed', 'prevent', 'death', 'However', 'wizard', 'be', 'rather', 'absent-minded', 'Thaibault', 'Andre', 'not', 'back', 'forward-all', 'way', 'year', '2000', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A
667413,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005NB9Y,Reviewer,"[26, 28]","Magic, as well as evil,  is afoot in 12th Century France, and when the two are combined to effect the sinister scheme of an unscrupulous individual the result is a comedic journey for a Nobleman and his lackey as they are transported into the 21st Century in ""Just Visiting,"" directed by Jean-Marie Poire, and starring Jean Reno and Christina Applegate.  Count Thibault (Reno) is about to marry Princess Rosalind (Applegate), daughter of King Henry (Richard Bremmer) and his Queen (Sarah Badel), but at a prenuptial banquet the Earl of Warwick (Robert Glenister), who covets the fair Rosalind, coerces a witch (Valerie Griffiths) into casting a spell that will enable him to usurp Thibault and make Rosalind his own.  The plan goes gravely awry, however, and Thibault subsequently engages the talents of an English Wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to set things aright.  But the Wizard proceeds to muck it up even worse, sending Thibault and his slave, Andre le Pate (Christian Clavier), into a ""Tunnel of time"" from which they ultimately emerge in Chicago, 2001, where they encounter Julia Malfete (also Applegate), the spitting image of Rosalind, who turns out to be a direct descendant of Thibault.  And it becomes the task of the Nobleman, Thibault, to find a way back to his own time.  In the meantime, he and Andre attempt to negotiate this world of the future with a Medieval mind-set that puts them at odds with the inanimate objects and humans that surround them.  And it becomes a trial by fire for the brave Count, and a laugh riot of uproarious proportions for the audience.This stranger-in-a-strange-land, fish-out-of-water scenario has been done before, to be sure, but it's given a fresh face here compliments of Poire, who sets a good pace and keeps the story on track, and the talents and impeccable comedic timing of his cast, especially Clavier and Reno, who play so well off of one another.  Much of what transpires is predictable-- the way Thibault and Andre react to a modern city replete with technology, and specifically things like automobiles, light switches and television-- but they always manage to take it one step further, which makes the humor spontaneous and genuinely funny.Reno is perfect as Thibault, playing it straight and allowing the humor to naturally evolve from the character's reaction to a situation rather than going for the purely physical humor.  Reno, in fact, demonstrates a real talent for acting through reacting, which makes his character believable and adds to the humor of the film.  He never allows Thibault to lose that 12th Century logic, willing to attest to his own nobility, for example, to anyone who will listen, and backing it up with a verbal inventory of his assets, which includes things like fifty barrels of olives and, of course, Andre.  It's not a performance that requires a lot of depth, but for the film to work it had to be done right, and with precision, and Reno succeeds admirably on both counts.Clavier, on the other hand, goes straight for the jugular with an all-out assault of slapstick and physical humor that takes it right to the edge and works perfectly in effecting what was intended:  He makes you laugh out loud.  Reminiscent of a cross between Peter Sellers' Clouseau-- though not as subtle-- and the best of Monty Python, Clavier creates a memorable character, who as the ""property"" of Thibault gives a real perspective and context to the humor of the story.  Some of his ""discoveries"" of the modern world will have you rolling on the floor.  And again, the fact that he plays the character straight and not just ""for"" laughs adds significantly to the overall humor of the film.Christina Applegate provides a welcome presence as Rosalind/Julia, and while not a stretch for her as an actor, by any means, she lends a quality to the film that could be easily overlooked, but would be quite apparent as a missing element without her.  She has a natural, charismatic manner that makes her endearing and sympathetic, and it's a good, solid performance through which she creates a credible, well rounded character.The supporting cast includes Matt Ross (Hunter), Tara Reid (Angelique), Bridgette Wilson (Amber), John Aylward (Byron), George Plimpton (Dr. Brady), Bill Bailey (Thibault's Father) and Clare Welch (Thibault's Mother).  A comedy that successfully blends the fine art of comedic subtlety with physical gags, ""Just Visiting"" is everything a comedy should be:  Funny and entertaining.  And it does it without venturing into over-the-top Farrelly Brothers territory or by employing the abstract brand of hilarity often offered by the Coen Brothers.  It's a film that succeeds on it's own merits, and does it splendidly.  It's a funny one you don't want to miss, and that's the magic of the movies.",4,All It Needs Is Clouseau,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,4784,"['Magic', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'afoot', '12th', 'Century', 'France', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'combined', 'effect', 'sinister', 'scheme', 'unscrupulous', 'individual', 'result', 'comedic', 'journey', 'Nobleman', 'lackey', 'are', 'transported', '21st', 'Century', 'Just', 'Visiting', 'directed', 'Jean-Marie', 'Poire', 'starring', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Count', 'Thibault', 'Reno', 'marry', 'Princess', 'Rosalind', 'Applegate', 'daughter', 'King', 'Henry', 'Richard', 'Bremmer', 'Queen', 'Sarah', 'Badel', 'prenuptial', 'banquet', 'Earl', 'Warwick', 'Robert', 'Glenister', 'who', 'fair', 'Rosalind', 'witch', 'Valerie', 'Griffiths', 'casting', 'spell', 'will', 'enable', 'usurp', 'Thibault', 'make', 'Rosalind', 'own', 'plan', 'gravely', 'awry', 'however', 'Thibault', 'subsequently', 'talents', 'English', 'Wizard', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'set', 'things', 'aright', 'Wizard', 'proceeds', 'muck', 'up', 'even', 'worse', 'sending', 'Thibault', 'slave', 'Andre', 'le', 'Pate', 'Christian', 'Clavier', 'Tunnel', 'time', 'ultimately', 'emerge', 'Chicago', '2001', 'where', 'encounter', 'Julia', 'Malfete', 'also', 'Applegate', 'spitting', 'image', 'Rosalind', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Thibault', 'task', 'Nobleman', 'Thibault', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'time', 'meantime', 'Andre', 'attempt', 'negotiate', 'world', 'future', 'Medieval', 'mind-set', 'odds', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'humans', 'surround', 'trial', 'fire', 'brave', 'Count', 'laugh', 'riot', 'uproarious', 'proportions', 'audience.This', 'stranger-in-a-strange-land', 'fish-out-of-water', 'scenario', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'be', 'sure', 'given', 'fresh', 'face', 'here', 'compliments', 'Poire', 'who', 'good', 'pace', 'story', 'track', 'talents', 'impeccable', 'comedic', 'timing', 'cast', 'especially', 'Clavier', 'Reno', 'who', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'Much', 'what', 'predictable', 'way', 'Thibault', 'Andre', 'react', 'modern', 'city', 'replete', 'technology', 'specifically', 'things', 'automobiles', 'light', 'switches', 'television', 'always', 'manage', 'take', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'humor', 'spontaneous', 'genuinely', 'funny.Reno', 'perfect', 'Thibault', 'playing', 'straight', 'allowing', 'humor', 'naturally', 'evolve', 'character', 'reaction', 'situation', 'rather', 'going', 'purely', 'physical', 'humor', 'Reno', 'fact', 'real', 'talent', 'acting', 'reacting', 'character', 'believable', 'humor', 'film', 'never', 'Thibault', 'lose', '12th', 'Century', 'logic', 'willing', 'attest', 'own', 'nobility', 'example', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'backing', 'up', 'verbal', 'inventory', 'assets', 'things', 'fifty', 'barrels', 'olives', 'course', 'Andre', 'not', 'performance', 'lot', 'depth', 'film', 'work', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'right', 'precision', 'Reno', 'admirably', 'counts.Clavier', 'other', 'hand', 'straight', 'jugular', 'all-out', 'assault', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'humor', 'right', 'edge', 'perfectly', 'effecting', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'out', 'loud', 'Reminiscent', 'cross', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Clouseau', 'though', 'not', 'subtle', 'best', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Clavier', 'memorable', 'character', 'who', 'property', 'Thibault', 'real', 'perspective', 'context', 'humor', 'story', 'discoveries', 'modern', 'world', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'again', 'fact', 'character', 'straight', 'not', 'just', 'significantly', 'overall', 'humor', 'film.Christina', 'Applegate', 'welcome', 'presence', 'Rosalind/Julia', 'not', 'stretch', 'actor', 'means', 'quality', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'apparent', 'missing', 'element', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'manner', 'endearing', 'sympathetic', 'good', 'solid', 'performance', 'credible', 'well', 'rounded', 'character.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Ross', 'Hunter', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Angelique', 'Bridgette', 'Wilson', 'Amber', 'John', 'Aylward', 'Byron', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'Dr.', 'Brady', 'Bill', 'Bailey', 'Thibault', 'Father', 'Clare', 'Welch', 'Thibault', 'Mother', 'comedy', 'successfully', 'fine', 'art', 'comedic', 'subtlety', 'physical', 'gags', 'Just', 'Visiting', 'everything', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'Funny', 'entertaining', 'venturing', 'over-the-top', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'territory', 'employing', 'abstract', 'brand', 'hilarity', 'often', 'offered', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'splendidly', 'funny', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'magic', 'movies']",N/A
