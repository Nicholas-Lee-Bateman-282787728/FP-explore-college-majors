This movie does a nice job of helping kids understand the passion of the issue.  Evolution is the cornerstone of modern day biology and it is important kids understand why it needs to be taught.  The amazing thing about science is that if evidence comes along to disprove a current school of thought, the discipline may change.  When religion is questioned the only response is to lash out with hostility and anger.  Why can't we question the way Man believes in God?",5,Invaluable,976579200,"12 12, 2000",2000,583,"['high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'deal', 'common', 'myths', 'misconceptions', 'involving', 'evolution', 'daily', 'basis', 'movie', 'nice', 'job', 'helping', 'kids', 'understand', 'passion', 'issue', 'Evolution', 'cornerstone', 'modern', 'day', 'biology', 'important', 'kids', 'understand', 'why', 'be', 'taught', 'amazing', 'thing', 'science', 'evidence', 'along', 'disprove', 'current', 'school', 'thought', 'discipline', 'may', 'change', 'When', 'religion', 'questioned', 'only', 'response', 'lash', 'out', 'hostility', 'anger', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'question', 'way', 'Man', 'God']",Inherit the Wind VHS

470421,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305600988,"""flickjunkie""","[16, 20]","This film is a remake of a 1960 movie about the 'Scopes' monkey trial in July of 1925, argued by prominent statesman William Jennings Bryan (for the prosecution and the Bible) and equally the prominent Clarence Darrow (for  the defense, scientific thought and Darwin). Rather than compare it with  the original, which I understand was brilliant, I will evaluate it on its  own.This is a powerful and thought provoking courtroom drama about a  school teacher who was arrested for teaching evolution, then considered a  heresy against God and the bible. The topic is unfortunately as timely  today as it was 75 years ago. The film is extremely effective at  illustrating the pervasive ignorance and fear so prevalent in  fundamentalist religions. It depicts with great clarity, the frenzied and  irrational efforts undertaken to suppress any knowledge that threatens to  debunk the myth and simple minded traditions that bind the faithful  together.Unfortunately, the presentation of the story had certain flaws  that kept it from being a truly great film. My biggest objections are all  directorial. First, this film was visually mediocre and pedestrian. The  camera basically followed the speaker around the room at the same angles  from pretty much the same distances. There were very few reaction shots  which would have greatly enhanced the drama. I don't think there was a  single reaction shot of any member of the jury and only a couple from the  gallery.Director Daniel Petrie takes enormous artistic license in  presenting the trial. The way it was portrayed it seemed more like an  unmoderated debate between the lawyers than a criminal trial with rules of  court. Granted, it was a small town in 1925, but this was ridiculous. In  real trials, lawyers have two opportunities to give speeches in a trial, in  opening and closing statements. During the trial itself, they are only to  ask questions and gather evidence under very strict rules. They can't give  speeches or lead the witness or inject their opinion about a witness'  testimony. This was flouted in the film as lawyers violated these rules  repeatedly with nary an objection from the other side. Ironically, the most  important speeches of the trial, closing arguments were completely missing  from the film.I found Jack Lemon's portrayal of defense lawyer Henry  Drummond to be disturbingly restrained. Lemon is clearly capable of  unfettered rage and indignation, yet he played his character with  resignation and defeatism rather than frustration and wrath. He simply  didn't fight hard enough for the principles in which he supposedly  believed. I blame this on Petrie.Without question, the performance of  the film belonged to George C. Scott in his last performance before his  death (a stunning coincidence since William Jennings Bryan, on whom Scott's  character is based, died shortly after this trial. So it was his last  performance as well). Scott is magnificent as the bible thumping prosecutor  rattling the rafters of the little courthouse with his booming gravel  voice. This was the type of part Scott was born to play and it may have  been his best performance since Patton. For this reason alone this film  should be on every film buff's list. If only Lemon brought similar fire to  his part, this film would have been riveting.Beau Bridges was a bit  overly obnoxious as the sardonic reporter E.K. Hornbeck. The role called  for a good deal of cynicism, but Bridges got carried away.Lane Smith  gives a terrific performance as the Lord possessed Reverend Brown, who  damns his own daughter to hell for refusing to renounce her love for her  fiance Cates, the accused school teacher. His sermon at the prayer meeting  was more than worthy of any cable TV evangelist.I gave this film a 7/10.  I think it would be rated higher by most people who think of a courtroom as  more of a dramatic setting than place of justice. Overall it is a credible  update of a topic that should remain in the forefront of our minds if we  hope to continue living in a free and rational society.",3,A thought provoking film.

It's a remake that's almost as good as the original.Much of the brilliance of the new version of Inherit the Wind comes from finding two old fogeys who have the same love/hate chamistry brought  to life in the original by Frederic March and Spencer Tracy; in this case,  the friendly adversaries are George C. Scott, in his last performance  before his death, and Jack Lemmon. Toss in Beau Bridges as the wisecracking  journalist and a surprisingly downbeat performance by Thom Evertt Scott as  the teacher who ends up a guinea pig in one of the biggest trials of the  century, and you got yourself a fine film. The comic timing is impeccable  on all counts, the lines from the film that have become cliche are  delivered with the same freshness that ignited them decades ago, and one  can almost believe that Scott and Lemmon actually are Bryan and Darrow  haggling it out in a Tennessee courtroom.If you've never seen  _Inherit the Wind_, start with the classic Spencer Tracy/Frederic March  version from 1960.
