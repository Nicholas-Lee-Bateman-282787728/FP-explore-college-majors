1593619,AGEIT17HENDIS,B009AMAO46,Alfred Johnson,"[4, 6]","As a member in good standing of the generation of `68 I have spent much cyber-ink talking about this and that ""seeking a newer world"" experiment we tried, with the emphasis on ""tried"", back in the day, back in the 1960s day under the rubric of the 18th century English poet William Wordworth's response to the early stirrings of the French Revolution- ""to be young was very heaven.""  And while, in the end, we were defeated by the monster of the prevailing mores of American society we tried to rock the boat. And politics aside nowhere was this culturally more exploited that in our music, our second-wave rock music (Elvis, Chuck, Bo, Buddy and Jerry Lee being the first wave back in the 1950s).Some argued, argued strenuously that ""music was the revolution."" Well, no, no it wasn't but who could blame anybody at the time for thinking that lofty thought.  Nowhere was this sentiment more pronounced that in the garages and family rooms of America, of suburban America when guys, and it was mainly guys then, tried to form their own rock and roll bands, especially in the wake of the ""British invasion (the Beatles and The Stone, mainly)"". Formed rock and roll bands to become famous, and if not famous as was the fate most bands that were formed including the band in the film under review, Not Fade Away, but at least to act as a magnet for, what else, girls.David Chase directed this little slice-of-life, 1960s style film, reflecting the hard fact that our generation is now deep in our memory mist stage, centered on the trials and tribulation of a group of guys, Jersey guys, high school Jersey guys at the start trying to break-out into the be-bop rock and roll night. But it could have just as easily been guys from Ames, Iowa or Winnemucca, Nevada trying for the brass ring amid the upheavals all around including the down-pressing down  war in Vietnam, the black liberation struggle south then north, the budding women's  and gay struggles, and the very publicly declared war against parental authority. Reflecting too here the unspoken assumption that time was when men (and women) played rock and roll for keeps in case our memory mist stage was a little foggy.Here, as always with garage and family room bands, there were struggles around who was, and who was not, going to be ""on the bus"", going to be in the band. And what level of commitment those members were willing to pursue to make it to the ""bigs."" Other issues that came up as well were how much hard time in lonely low-down joints were the members willing to do to ""pay their dues"" and the big question in the break-out sixties about whether to be a cover band or concentrate, like the Beatles and the Stones, on writing their own music and not depend of Tin Pan Alley.Of course no 1960s coming-of-age film saga can avoid the generational conflicts and the film has plenty of that focused on star John Magaro and his relationship with his father, the late James Gandolfini, as back-drop to muddy the cultural waters (you know-"" what are you going to do with your life after this momentary obsession, son or daughter""-what do you mean you are dropping out of school""- what are you going to do about that damn draft notice""-what do you mean you're  going to live with him (or her)-well you get the drift). And as well the changing boy-girl thing in the post-pill world, the beginning of women striking out on their own guys be damned, drugs, more drugs, and of course more rock and roll. So if you want to see what it was like for a minute back then through the eyes of those who were pioneers, or just confused and ""winging it"" then take a couple of hours to imbibe this one. And listen to a great soundtrack as well. Yah, then you might know what I meant when I said ""to be young was very heaven.""So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?-The ByrdsSo you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?Then listen now to what I sayJust get an electric guitarThen take some timeand learn how to playAnd with your hair swung rightAnd your pants too tightIt's gonna be all rightThen it's time to go downtownWhere the agent man

1593629,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B009AMAO46,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","Navigating life like a disjointed diary, David Chase's ""Not Fade Away"" is a rare work of nostalgia minus rose-colored glasses. Today, few filmmakers would have the muscle to pull off such an epic tale of personal memories, but following Chase's gigantic hitThe Sopranos: The Complete Series, he was likely (though reluctantly) given the green light. And what a fascinating work it is.This 2012 film came and went so quietly few are aware of its existence. Chase, of course, cut his teeth in television before the historical explosion of ""The Sopranos"" in 1999, and now has this debut as a filmmaker. ""Not Fade Away"" is a meandering, coming-of-age tale detailing a high school youth in 1963 New Jersey. One enchanted evening, he hears The Beatles for the first time and asks, ""What is that?"" Thus begins a journey through the glorious and tumultuous age of the 1960s. Our quirky protagonist Douglas Damiano (John Magaro) joins a band to attract the girl, grows his hair, zips up his boots and embraces the revolution. And the band, called The Twylight Zones, is pretty good.The music is key and Chase, with the assistance of Steven Van Zandt, has accumulated a mesmerizing soundtrack (NOT FADE AWAY SOUNDTRACK DAVID CHASE FILM) including Robert Johnson, Leadbelly, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and numerous other musicians influencing the beginning beats of a movement. Chase certainly knew the era, having grown up in New Jersey and playing in a rock band. ""Not Fade Away"" reminded me ofSLC Punk,Dazed and ConfusedandAlmost Famous, similarly authentic works forged by men recalling their youths. But I think Chase was aiming for something higher, a sort of American tragedy of regret, the bomb, lost innocence and disillusionment unfurling like a Jack Kerouac novel (On the Road). And perhaps that is where the film stumbles.I didn't like the frame, essentially Damiano's younger sister (Meg Guzulescu) recalling memories of him. And the recreation of the meeting of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger on the Dartford railway, the moment The Rolling Stones began, was unnecessary. But should we fault filmmakers Terrence Malick forThe Tree Of Lifeor Kenneth Lonergan forMargaret? Those unruly works aimed for impossible stars. And yet they at least fired the shot.Much has been made of the conclusion, a sort of ambiguous, bittersweet moment of desolation that will haunt the viewer. It's similar to Chase's abrupt conclusion to ""The Sopranos,"" which infuriated many. But the clues are there. Damiano's dream of rock stardom has ended in Los Angeles and he finds himself isolated and hitchhiking. An ominous car pulls up and a woman, her face painted white with blue teardrops, offers him a ride. The rest of the occupants are covered in shadow. Just what does Damiano sense? Is it the Manson family, as the NY Times suggested, a perverted growth of the era led by an enraged man unable to achieve rock stardom and thus taking out his frustrations with murder?Maybe. It could also be the future. The face-paint is similar to Glam Rock styles of the early 1970s, which would evolve into Punk Rock. Is it a coincidence that almost immediately The Sex Pistols' ""Roadrunner"" (The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle) begins to play? Has Damiano seen the future and realized his road is destined for a new path? With shock on his face, he refuses the ride and walks away. Perhaps at that moment, for one man, the 1960s ended (and if it was the Manson family, then Damiano has seen the demons that will bring the era to a crashing halt).I cried, I sighed and I thought about that ending for days afterward.

1593632,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B009AMAO46,Darren O'Neill,"[1, 1]","Going into this movie all I knew about it was that it was about music and that it was made by David Chase, the same guy that made ""The Sopranos"" and that James Gandolfini was in the movie.  If you watched ""The Sopranos"" you know that the series was over the top with plenty of action.  Here in ""Not Fade Away"" Chase changes gears entirely and gives us an understated gem.  The story is based upon his own life, so there is no doubt it is a story he was passionate about telling.One of the reviews that I'd read here on Amazon blasted the movie for being all over the place, saying:""Is it about the protagonist dealing with his girlfriend and his jealousy? Is it about Rock & Roll? Is it about the father played by James Gandolfini dealing with his cancer? Is it about the girlfriend's crazy sister (who may or may not be mentally ill)? Is it about the band? The music industry? The Rolling Stones? Is it about Free Love? Is it about racism - both overt and covert?  Trying to cram all of these plot threads together makes for a messy movie.""My answer to that is yes, it is about all of those things.  It is a movie about life and growing up, both of which ARE in fact messy.  I love that fact that Chase did not just tell us a story about a band.  I love that Chase did not just tell us the love story.  To me, the way the story was presented was perfectly done.I also enjoyed how Chase entwined the ""Twilight Zone"" television show into the movie.  I think we have all felt at some time or another that we just might be living in the twilight zone at some time in our lives!This is a movie about growing up, meeting girls, becoming popular, meeting new friends and discovering rock and roll.  There are some ups and plenty of downs.  The characters are true to life and there was not a bad performance in the bunch here.The bottom line is I recommend this movie for anyone that likes a nice quiet story with a lot of loud rock and roll thrown in for good measure.",5,David Chase Takes Us To The Twilight Zone Of His Life,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1963,"['Going', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'made', 'David', 'Chase', 'same', 'guy', 'made', 'Sopranos', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'was', 'movie', 'watched', 'Sopranos', 'know', 'series', 'was', 'top', 'plenty', 'action', 'Here', 'Not', 'Fade', 'Away', 'Chase', 'gears', 'entirely', 'understated', 'gem', 'story', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'doubt', 'story', 'was', 'passionate', 'telling.One', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'read', 'here', 'Amazon', 'blasted', 'movie', 'being', 'place', 'saying', 'protagonist', 'dealing', 'girlfriend', 'jealousy', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'father', 'played', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'dealing', 'cancer', 'girlfriend', 'crazy', 'sister', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'mentally', 'ill', 'band', 'music', 'industry', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Free', 'Love', 'racism', 'overt', 'covert', 'Trying', 'cram', 'plot', 'threads', 'together', 'messy', 'movie', 'answer', 'yes', 'things', 'movie', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'ARE', 'fact', 'messy', 'love', 'fact', 'Chase', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'band', 'love', 'Chase', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'love', 'story', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'was', 'perfectly', 'done.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Chase', 'entwined', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'television', 'show', 'movie', 'think', 'have', 'felt', 'time', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'living', 'twilight', 'zone', 'time', 'lives', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'meeting', 'girls', 'becoming', 'popular', 'meeting', 'new', 'friends', 'discovering', 'rock', 'roll', 'are', 'ups', 'plenty', 'downs', 'characters', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'bunch', 'here.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'nice', 'quiet', 'story', 'lot', 'loud', 'rock', 'roll', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure']",N/A

A young white kid extolling the virtues of bluesmen Leadbelly and Robert Johnson to his co-worker, a genteel black man, who tells the incredulous youngster he prefers Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett.  These are just two of the terrific moments that encompass ""Not Fade Away"".  Unfortunately as memorable as these moments are they don't add up to a cohesive whole.  Writer-director David Chase, creator of ""The Sopranos"", does not fully succeed in crafting a coherent narrative.  For starters the film is narrated in the first person not by the main character, Douglas (John Magaro), but by his baby sister.  This conceit could work but Chase doesn't see it through.  Maybe it's a case of Chase biting off more than he can chew.  The film's time span is the weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and weeks preceding the slaying of Robert F. Kennedy.  To Chase's credit he has the look and sound of the era down to a tee.

1593638,A3FQ9WYUHG9CD,B009AMAO46,"DMGenest | ""Genet""","[0, 0]","A coming of age movie, released in 2012, about a young lad who becomes infatuated with rock'n' roll music and, like a lot of lads in America in the 60's, got himself into a rock band. 'Not FadeAway' is a Buddy Holly song covered by the Rolling Stones and a myriad of other groups. Greatappropriate title and a good beginning...The movie starts with the grind of family living and you see the boy move towards Rock 'n Rollwhere he feels more accepted, and best of all, he notices how it attracts chicks. It also showsyou the ins and outs of keeping a band together and what happens with your principles whenyou actually get close to the professional level. 'Sell out' is still being used against bands whoseem to 'go' more commercial, more popular and make more money.This is not a morality tale about a fallen rock god. This is about what a lot of teenagers ran offto do and subsequently attempted, failed and moved on with their lives. The Protagonist doesnot get too close to fame at all and ends up wandering down the street. In one scene in LA, hewas able to hobnob with a few famous locals and the Stones drummer shows up and quicklyexits the party. The Protagonist is still a fan and not quite the musician. It is not what heimagined at all and he misses fame just as he misses meeting a Rolling Stone.Even in a feel good moment with his dad, who has harassed him about his music, actually endsup supporting him as he drives off, with his girl friend, to do a battle of the bands in real time.It works because you see the dad look back at his younger days and starts to understand whatdrives his son. Nice moment but there is no single emotional thread holding the film togetherinto a cohesive story.Overall, the movie missed its potential. It could have become a bitter-sweet remembrance  fromthe teen years; instead it felt more episodic when there was a definite story arc going on. I alsodabbled in a rock band as a teen and have recently taken up the electric guitar, again. I thoughtthis film would bring back good memories but it did not. The pieces were there but the picturepuzzle is never fully realized and falls flat in the end.Stephen Van Zandt ('Little Steven' from Springsteen's E Street Band) was the music director.The music picked for the soundtrack is very good to excellent. This sometimes happens; wherethe movie soundtrack is more coherent and exciting than the film. Kudos Mr. Van Zandt on themusic because that could have helped the film fail. Unfortunately it needed more than a goodsound track.A good attempt but I gave it 3 stars for some good writing, decent  acting from a lot of relativeunknowns except, James Gandofini, as the father and Brad Garret as a talent scout/agent type.The Art Director did a good job of recreating the 60's and a few memories were sparked due tothe visuals.

A large cast for a standard-length film--it sometimes becomes difficult to place who's who. NOT FADE AWAY captures the 60s quite well, showing how the decade of phonograph records and the Vietnam War was simultaneously different and similar to our own era.

I felt the characters employed were meant to play the character and no substitutions whatsoever could have been made.Secondly, the film has unique musical power to stun you, this musical prowess displayed in the form of concerts and young garage bands is further punctuated by the agonies of a young heart. The emotions captured at times are truly raw and fascinating, in a lot of ways you can say this is a bit like Flashbacks of a fool, it has that mocking bird'esque power of moving you.But wait, thats not it. The last 12 minutes the film takes a ride of it's own. They introduce to you the mystical land that calls out to all humans called California. And how do I say this?

1593650,A1B6HZ2W5XCV0I,B009AMAO46,Jersey Kid,"[25, 28]","I had high, very high, expectations for this movie, depicting the rise and fall of a Rolling Stones-influenced garage band from New Jersey. David Chase are I are both Jersey kids; are more-or-less the same age (he is 67; I am 63) and had some of the same experiences. I sat down to watch this flick, expecting to be pulled through an earlier part of my life.The beginning of the film set the stage in a fabulous manner, with the imagined meeting of Mick and Keith on a train heading to school. (As a side note: when in the world will someone film a similar event of Lennon and McCartney?) A voice-over by the sister of the stories protagonist informs us that while almost everyone knows how that story goes; a similar one involving her brother Doug is known to virtually no one. The very obvious implication here is that her brother's band was not a success.With that thought in mind we are allowed to observe the life of the band for the rest of its existence. Through this part of the film, we have the archetypical age band story. We watch the members fumble with their instruments, aping what they see and hear of their heroes. Gradually, competency occurs, amidst personal changes. Finally, the band stabilizes with five members who are capable of performing live and being appreciated by others. Conflict remains in the form of a battle for the lead singer role, and while a truce holds for a while, the loser is eventually forced from the band. Unfortunately, this isn't the end of the band's problems. Two members separately sow the seeds that eventually lead to the demise of the band. One member won't do shows outside the local area, citing loyalty to friends. The other - a marvelous example of gutless backstabbing - paints everything as a plot to parry his cowardice and continuously poisons his bandmates with accusation and innuendo. This reaches a climax when the band cannot agree to move to New York City as part of ""paying its dues.""With the band in disarray, our hero elects to decamp to California with his girlfriend. When last we see his bandmates, they are standing outside the same pizza place where they have stood all their lives and likely always will. California is, of course, a disaster as the only reason to go lies in an attempt to escape reality (a dying father in a modestly dysfunctional family and the collapse of his dream with the band) and to follow his girlfriend. Sun and surf do not provide the solution either artistically or emotionally. Mistrust - real and imagined - leads to his wandering the streets of LA, seeking a ride to who knows where. The trek halts briefly outside a music store, where our hero, after viewing the instruments, has a smile come to his face. In the background, music can now be heard. The song is `Roadrunner,' though not the song of that name by Junior Walker & the All Stars, nor an earlier one by Bo Diddley. Instead it is the paean to the open road and the redemptive quality of rock `n' roll written by Jonathan Richman in 1972. But, to skew time and space even more, it's the Sex Pistols version from 1977. So, with music of the future behind him, Doug starts walking again, though this time it seems to be with a purpose. We are left alone in the middle of the street briefly, until his sister appears in the frame. She tells a story about a term paper she wrote about the United States providing two things: nuclear war and rock `n' roll; with the question being, which one will win. She begins to walk away, stops to look over her shoulder at us, smiles and then begins to dance.Clearly, this isn't `That Thing You Do.' Neither is it `Almost Famous;' nor `Light of Day,' to name three films while not having necessarily happy endings, at least had resolutions of sorts. When it first ended, I thought - as I had several times during the film - that it was another of those pointless films that seem jump into a story and out of it with no apparent conclusion. But, as time passed my view of the film has changed and probably will continue to do so.Still, let me start with a weakness in the film about which I don't think my views will change. There's a lot going on in this film as relates to the characters. I believe that Mr. Chase - a creature of television, where multiple episodes and seasons allow for leisurely character development - presented us with complex characters but no roadmap to understanding them. I think having to decide what you thought were characters' motivations became so burdensome, it made thinking about the movie as a whole harder to do.At the same time, I feel this film is an incredibly accurate portrayal of the 1960s culture and the cataclysmic effects music had on that generation of kids. It also exposed the overwhelming truth that most of what one thinks and says and does takes place in a swirl of incomplete and distracting information. It's not like `That Thing You Do,' where the families are happy or non-existent. People get sick, people lose jobs; your friends let you and/or you let them down. In short s*** happens and life goes on. In the end, I guess, we all have to learn that - to paraphrase John Lennon - life is what happens while you're planning other things. In the end, it is a movie more about life than it is about music. However, for many of us - Mr. Chase included - the two are intertwined.",3,No happy endings here but truth is told,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,5334,"['had', 'high', 'very', 'high', 'expectations',

Though this one was set at the beginning of Rock and Roll, the 1960s, rather than modern times.The directorial debut of Sopranos creator David Chase, it is the story of 4 guys trying to start a rock band in mid/late -1960s New Jersey. Little Stevie Van Zant was the musical producer so you KNOW the soundtrack was awesomeI did find the characters interesting, with the typical generation gap between James Gandofini's father figure and his son, the main character. Nothing new, a plot device used in MANY 1960s set movies, but still interesting when the father is, for all intents and purposes, Tony Soparano! And the conflicting egos of the band members made for typical band in-fighting.And I KNEW I recognized the guy that played the guitarist, just didn't place him right away without his tin mask (the wounded sniper Richard Harrow from Boardwalk Empire, with 1/2 his face covered by a tin mask)I also must say I find the people who didn't like the end, especially the people that didn't ""get"" the ending amusing. It was as clear as day to me....the main character moved to Hollywood to get into movies, driving the final nail in the coffin of the band.So it ended right where it SHOULD have ended, with him walking off ""into his new life"". The story was about the BAND, and that story was over. His future in the movie, possibly movie soundtrack, industry is the unknown future....and another story entirely.Bottom line, if you like coming-of-age stories, movies about struggling artists or even movies about the 60s, watch this, you won't be disappointed.

In fact, one of the extras to the film suggests that the film is largely autobiographical.  In his first directing and writing assignment for the big screen, he gives us a glimpse of the heyday of immerging rock `n roll.In a time when the nation was still in mourning over President Kennedy's assassination, Douglas (John Magaro) hears the Beatles for the first time on the radio, followed by The Rolling Stones, and others.  He is a wannabe drummer who is asked to join a band fronted by Eugene (Jack Huston) who also plays lead guitar.  Douglas who spends as much time as he can searching out black blues artists from an earlier time, realizes that the Stones, Beatles, Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and many others have discovered this American music form and made it their own.Prior to a house party where the band is to play, Eugene swallows a lit joint which puts him out of action for the night.  Rather than fold up the show, Douglas is coaxed into handling the singing duties with a couple other classmates picking up on his drumming and Eugene's guitar.  He's quickly seen as the better singer and draws attention from a girl he's always pined for.  Grace (Bella Heathcote), in fact, is a kind of girlfriend of Eugene's.  Uh Oh!The film finds many of the usual clich&eacute;s of the time.  James Gandolfini plays Douglas' dad Pat who is stereotypically against long hair, Cuban heels and flowery shirts.  Not to mention social epithets assigned to anyone outside his Italian heritage.  Then there is mom (Molly Price) who yells as much as dad and is never seen without her housecoat and hair rollers.  Still the story rings true and some of the interactions between the characters feel real if a bit strained.  Overall the film is funny, a little sad but entertaining throughout.  And provides a bit of history of the rock revolution.The Blu ray presentation is terrific.  It has a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The wonderful set pieces are shown with great clarity and detail.  Close ups are sharp and beautifully focused.  Good color hues are presented throughout and black levels are excellent.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is also excellent.  This is a music centered film and it comes out nicely especially when the actor/musician based band plays live.  There is also plenty of now classic songs throughout the film.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds other than when the music is playing but the dialog is crystal clear.  French, Spanish and English SDH subtitles are available.  Extras include ""The Basement Tapes"" which consist of 3 segments or ""tracks"" including the one with Chase explaining his love of the music of the time.  Another short features looks at the casting.  There is also more than 5 minutes of deleted scenes.",4,"(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for an entertaining, if not terribly original, look at an American rock band.",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,2901,"['David', 'Chase', 'credibility', 'gloriously', 'famous', 'Sopranos', 'television', 'show', 'era', 'grew', 'up', 'fact', 'one', 'extras', 'film', 'film', 'largely', 'autobiographical', 'first', 'directing', 'writing', 'assignment', 'big', 'screen', 'glimpse', 'heyday', 'immerging', 'rock', 'n', 'roll.In', 'time', 'when', 'nation', 'was', 'still', 'mourning', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'Douglas', 'John', 'Magaro', 'Beatles', 'first', 'time', 'radio', 'followed', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'others', 'wannabe', 'drummer', 'who', 'asked', 'join', 'band', 'fronted', 'Eugene', 'Jack', 'Huston', 'who', 'also', 'lead', 'guitar', 'Douglas', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'can', 'searching', 'out', 'black', 'blues', 'artists', 'earlier', 'time', 'Stones', 'Beatles', 'Hendrix', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'discovered', 'American', 'music', 'form', 'made', 'own.Prior', 'house', 'party', 'where', 'band', 'play', 'Eugene', 'lit', 'joint', 'action', 'night', 'Rather', 'fold', 'up', 'show', 'Douglas', 'coaxed', 'handling', 'singing', 'duties', 'couple', 'other', 'classmates', 'picking', 'up', 'drumming', 'Eugene', 'guitar', 'quickly', 'seen', 'better', 'singer', 'draws', 'attention', 'girl', 'always', 'pined', 'Grace', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', 'fact', 'kind', 'girlfriend', 'Eugene', 'Uh', 'Oh', 'film', 'many', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'time', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Douglas', 'dad', 'Pat', 'who', 'stereotypically', 'long', 'hair', 'Cuban', 'heels', 'flowery', 'shirts', 'Not', 'mention', 'social', 'epithets', 'assigned', 'anyone', 'Italian', 'heritage', 'Then', 'mom', 'Molly', 'Price', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'dad', 'never', 'seen', 'housecoat', 'hair', 'rollers', 'Still', 'story', 'rings', 'true', 'interactions', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'bit', 'strained', 'film', 'funny', 'little', 'sad', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'history', 'rock', 'revolution.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'presentation', 'terrific', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'wonderful', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'shown', 'great', 'clarity', 'detail', 'Close', 'ups', 'are', 'sharp', 'beautifully', 'focused', 'Good', 'color', 'hues', 'are', 'presented', 'black', 'levels', 'are', 'excellent', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'also', 'excellent', 'music', 'centered', 'film', 'out', 'nicely', 'especially', 'when', 'actor/musician', 'based', 'band', 'plays', 'live', 'also', 'plenty', 'now', 'classic', 'songs', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'going', 'surrounds', 'other', 'when', 'music', 'playing', 'dialog', 'crystal', 'clear', 'French', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'Extras', 'include', 'Basement', 'Tapes', 'consist', '3', 'segments', 'tracks', 'including', 'one', 'Chase', 'explaining', 'love', 'music', 'time', 'short', 'features', 'casting', 'also', 'more', '5', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

The story is very loosely based on Chase's days of growing up in New Jersey in the early 1960s, with Douglas (played by John Magaro) standing in for Chase. The movie starts with a retelling of the infamous meeting between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on a train in the early 60s, and not long thereafter we see the Stones appear on TV and Douglas and his friends want to start a band ""like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles"". The voice over is from Douglas' sister, informing us she is going to tell ""the story of this band nobody has ever heard off"". There are many side stories and characters in the movie, none more so than Douglas' dad, played by James ""Tony Soprano"" Gandolfini, which in my opinion was very risky: how can you see this man play yet another Italian patriach with an anger problem and not think Tony Soprano?But in the end the story line is secondary to the music and the time capsule of the 60s that you find in every frame of this movie. The movie soundtrack was supervised by Steven Van Zandt, yes, that Steven Van Zandt, and he does an incredible job not only compiling a ton of great 60s music (and thankfully not always the same ol' same ol' standards), but the band Douglas and his friends are putting together do some nice tunes as well. This movie is eye-candy from start to finish, I couldn't stop marveling at the incredible amount of details that went into framing this movie visually. Chase's writing is pretty crisp throughout the movie. At one point the band is close to signing and their would-be manager tells them that for the next 6 months they should play 7 days a week, 2 sets a night, at every and any possible bar in New York. One of the guys in the band protests and says ""we can't do that, our music is art, it would demystify our music for our fans"". To which the would-be manager answers: ""Music is a business. The Beatles played for 2 years in Hamburg, Germany in strip joints."" End of discussion, ha!It is clear that this movie is a labor of love for David Chase, and at that it succeeds entirely. While the story line is lacking a major dramatic undercurrent, there is plenty enough other things that kept my interest in the movie from start to finish. In the end, it is all about the music in this movie, so if you are not really into music (or 60s music to be precize), save yourself the trouble. But if you are, like me, a huge music fan, this movie will pretty much delight from start to finish. For those interested, the movie's soundtrack is available separately and brings a great collection of 26 songs from that era.",4,It's all about the music,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2694,"['Not', 'Fade', 'Away', '2012', 'release', '112', 'min', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'writer-director', 'David', 'Sopranos', 'Chase', 'story', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Chase', 'days', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'Jersey', 'early', '1960s', 'Douglas', 'played', 'John', 'Magaro', 'standing', 'Chase', 'movie', 'retelling', 'infamous', 'meeting', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'train', 'early', '60s', 'not', 'long', 'thereafter', 'see', 'Stones', 'appear', 'TV', 'Douglas', 'friends', 'want', 'start', 'band', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Beatles', 'voice', 'Douglas', 'sister', 'informing', 'going', 'tell', 'story', 'band', 'nobody', 'ever', 'heard', 'off', 'are', 'many', 'side', 'stories', 'characters', 'movie', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Douglas', 'dad', 'played', 'James', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Gandolfini', 'opinion', 'was', 'very', 'risky', 'how', 'can', 'see', 'man', 'play', 'yet', 'Italian', 'patriach', 'anger', 'problem', 'not', 'think', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'end', 'story', 'line', 'secondary', 'music', 'time', 'capsule', '60s', 'find', 'frame', 'movie', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'supervised', 'Steven', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'yes', 'Steven', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'incredible', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'compiling', 'ton', 'great', '60s', 'music', 'thankfully', 'not', 'always', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol', 'standards', 'band', 'Douglas', 'friends', 'are', 'putting', 'together', 'do', 'nice', 'tunes', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'eye-candy', 'start', 'finish', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'marveling', 'incredible', 'amount', 'details', 'went', 'framing', 'movie', 'visually', 'Chase', 'writing', 'pretty', 'crisp', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'band', 'close', 'signing', 'would-be', 'manager', 'next', '6', 'months', 'should', 'play', '7', 'days', 'week', '2', 'sets', 'night', 'possible', 'bar', 'New', 'York', 'One', 'guys', 'band', 'protests', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'music', 'art', 'would', 'demystify', 'music', 'fans', 'would-be', 'manager', 'answers', 'Music', 'business', 'Beatles', 'played', '2', 'years', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'strip', 'joints', 'End', 'discussion', 'ha', 'clear', 'movie', 'labor', 'love', 'David', 'Chase', 'entirely', 'story', 'line', 'lacking', 'major', 'dramatic', 'undercurrent', 'plenty', 'enough', 'other', 'things', 'kept', 'interest', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'end', 'music', 'movie', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'music', '60s', 'music', 'be', 'precize', 'save', 'trouble', 'are', 'huge', 'music', 'fan', 'movie', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'interested', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'available', 'separately', 'great', 'collection', '26', 'songs', 'era']",N/A

A ""tweener"" movie if I ever saw one- not quite about coming of age, not quite about the music business, not quite about how interpersonal relationships can affect the success or failure of a musical group.Although possessing a wonderful soundtrack and above average acting (the young Mr. Magaro is an amazing ""fit"" as the primary protagonist and central character)(and he has a killer sneer), there are unsympathetic characterizations galore including James Gandolfini playing Tony Soprano Lite and Molly Price augmenting the austere and depressing home environment with her slovenly wisecracks and ever present curlers and depressing observations about the world around her.Making matters worse, Doug and Grace move to California in a valiant attempt to resuscitate their childhood dreams, when Doug inexplicably leaves and attempts to thumb his way back home.  Then the final scene- in Lynchian fashion- has Doug walking off camera and his little sister engaged in a surreal, gyrating solo dance mid-street, to a Sex Pistols song.  Not only is this pantomime incredibly awkward and ill-timed, it adds little of substance and does nothing to forward the story or explain character motivations.  In fact the last 30 minutes of Not Fade Away is a cinematic black hole which only serves to suck dramatic momentum from the story.A harmless faux biopic that devolves into a self conscious attempt to channel David Lynch.

Steven Van Zandt was the musical producer, and he brought in some members if the 'E' Street Band to make the music.Douglas, played by John Magaro, the nerdish boy from New Jersey, plays the drums, longs to be big man in the band.

Two of the stories were pretty good and the rest sounded like half-baked Creative Writing exercises (didn't help matters that he admitted that many of the stories were creative writing exercises) I've been a Gaiman fan since Sandman and I saw many indications of his style in the stories and yet it left me cold. I eventually chalked it up to Gaiman's talents requiring a larger canvas than a short story to work.That's the best explanation I can come up with for this movie. David Chase had seven seasons to tell the stories required by The Sopranos and the results were quite brilliant. Sadly, he's only got two hours to tell the story of a teenager growing up in the 1960s and playing in a rock band. Unfortunately, he acts as if he has entire seasons to develop all the dangling plots and characters. The fact that it's based on his life story makes it even more prone to self-indulgence.Instead of one good movie, this film represents about a dozen short films that don't necessarily work together. It's like Chase can't decide what the movie is about. Is it about the protagonist dealing with his girlfriend and his jealousy? Is it about Rock & Roll? Is it about the father played by James Gandolfini dealing with his cancer? Is it about the girlfriend's crazy sister (who may or may not be mentally ill)? Is it about the band? The music industry? The Rolling Stones? Is it about Free Love? Is it about racism - both overt and covert?Trying to cram all of these plot threads together makes for a messy movie. When the protagonist confronts his girlfriend with her sexual past, it sounds like a devastating moment but two scenes later they are back together because there are too many other plots to get through to fully explain what happened in between. When the protagonist tries talking about the Blues to a black co-worker, he sounds like he's trying to reach out in the most clueless way possible and yet that character never shows up again.There are still good moments. The protagonist's sister showing up to say that she's writing a paper on nuclear bombs and Rock & Roll before dancing in the street is cool.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[24, 29]","I saw this film on the big screen last year at the Philadelphia Film Festival and was looking forward to seeing it on home video and to see what bonus features would be added. There's so much music - both played by the actors as characters in the film, and as snippets of licensed music from the 1962-68 time period, that I sometimes lost track of the story while concentrating on the great music - selected, by the way, by Executive Producer Steven Van Zandt (of the E Street Band). (When I saw in the theater I kept asking myself what the licensing fees must have been to release this film.)As you will learn from the Bonus features on the Blu-ray (no bonuses on the standard DVD) this film was germinating in the mind of writer/director David Chase from the moment his HBO series ""The Sopranos"" ended. It took a while for him to say what he wanted. Not to give any ""spoilers"" (but I think you will find it helpful), Chase chose ACTORS , not musicians, to play the roles of members of the band (rather than choosing musicians and teaching them to act), and gave them four weeks of full-day music lessons before even starting the shoot.The cast is basically unknowns except for James Gandolfini . I found I could relate to the actors who I had no previous image of, then I could Gandolfini, who still looks and sounds like Tony Soprano.Chase chose to set the film in the years between 1962 and 1968, a time frame that had more changes in pop music styles (and fashion too!) than at any other time in music history. Anyone who was at least eight years old in 1962 will easily relate to this film.As I noted above there are bonuses on the BD version. First comes a three-part ""Making of"" doc titled ""The Basement Tapes"". The running time is 33 minutes and gives a good feeling for why Chase chose to make it.  The next bonus is called ""Building The Band"" but it really adds nothing in its three-minute length that wasn't covered in the Basement Tapes featurette (and some of the interviews are repeated). Lastly there are four ""deleted scenes"" (actually only part of the scenes shown were deleted) which has a total time of about five minutes.If you  saw this in the theaters and liked it, it's worth re-watching on disc. If you collect rock records of the 1960s and you haven't seen the film I think you'll enjoy it. I did!I hope that you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,A love letter to 1962-68 pop/rock music.

1593685,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B009AMAO46,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 2]","""Not Fade Away"" depicts the impact of the 1960`s British rock 'n' roll invasion on suburban New Jersey teenagers.  Doug (John Magaro) is a high school student enamored of a set of drums in the window of the local music store.  He meets another musician and they start a band, learn the latest Rolling Stones hit, and begin playing for basement parties, where he hopes to connect with an upper-class schoolmate, Grace (Bella Heathcote).Doug's working-class father, Pat (James Gandolfini), doesn't share his son's vision of a celebrity future.  A TV set airing a tribute to the recently assassinated John F. Kennedy sets the period as late 1963, and the times are rapidly changing.  Writer David Chase has captured the era and characters vividly, particularly in the details and the terrific soundtrack of 60's music.You don't have to be a fan of 60's rock to like this film.  Unfolding episodically, this coming-of-age film is endearing in its innocence.  The mostly unknown cast is excellent, but it's Gandolfini who shines. Rather than merely play Pat as a law-abiding version of Tony Soprano, he delves deeply into his blue-collar character to portray his regrets and desires.Blu-ray bonus extras include deleted scenes and several featurettes.",4,Vivid recreation of the 1960's,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,1246,"['Not', 'Fade', 'Away', 'impact', '1960', 's', 'British', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'invasion', 'suburban', 'New', 'Jersey', 'teenagers', 'Doug', 'John', 'Magaro', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'enamored', 'set', 'drums', 'window', 'local', 'music', 'store', 'musician', 'start', 'band', 'learn', 'latest', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'hit', 'begin', 'playing', 'basement', 'parties', 'where', 'connect', 'upper-class', 'schoolmate', 'Grace', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', '.Doug', 'working-class', 'father', 'Pat', 'James', 'Gandolfini', ""n't"", 'share', 'son', 'vision', 'celebrity', 'future', 'TV', 'set', 'airing', 'tribute', 'recently', 'assassinated', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'period', 'late', '1963', 'times', 'are', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'Writer', 'David', 'Chase', 'captured', 'era', 'characters', 'vividly', 'particularly', 'details', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', '60', 'music.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', '60', 'rock', 'like', 'film', 'Unfolding', 'episodically', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'endearing', 'innocence', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'shines', 'Rather', 'merely', 'play', 'Pat', 'law-abiding', 'version', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'deeply', 'blue-collar', 'character', 'portray', 'regrets', 'desires.Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'several', 'featurettes']",N/A

SPOILER ALERT !It's a coming of age rock n roll nightmare in which every single human pillar that makes for satisfying and fulfilling human relations is betrayed. A leader of the band suddenly decides to put on his own anti-war thing just as the band is getting popular, another looks for ways to fail and blame others; sabatoging the band. Young love has its innocense smashed, and in the end, betrayal in that vein is dealt ice-cold and very well. The TECHNICAL ITEMS are 5-STARS!Magaro morphs into an astonishing young Bob Dylan lookalike very well, and he's a good actor but the story goes from un-feeling dysfunction - Gandolfini's character refuses to accept his sons Christmas present because of his hair? What is that???? Then in a sitdown (sorry for that pun) shares the most intimate temptation, then dismisses the son's (Magaro) offer vis-a-vis the impending medical doom. This offers neither drama nor pathos. It's like a movie where a character calls someone an N-word over and over; revealing nothing more than a bland racist. Gandolfini's character reflects a similar mess. It's almost Tony Kutchner-like in its desire to say to the viewer, ""Here, this is what you should all think about this character. See how Archie Bunker he is?""The REASON I gave it 1-star:I got my first apt in the East Village in 1967. Lived in Hollywood thru the 70's. I dont need lectures on hippies or music, but it seems like the ending is trying to pit some glorious nuance that is  rock n roll versus the ""establishment"". I dont agree. Music we lose ourselves in functions within the same paradigm as drugs, drinking, gambling, etc. If I've got my headphones on w.500mics of acid, whether I have the Doors, ""This is the End,"" or ""Handel's Messiah"" blasting me out into world's unspeakable, the real world has enemies of freedom. The real world has people who think they'll go to heaven by killing people who dont believe like you do. So when Mr. Chase messes with an important subject, he's gonna get called to a higher standard. They like to smack down conservatives. I smack them down instead (metaphorically speaking). Chase's character mentions children dying in Nam. Does he ever mention the 3,000,000 Asians the Communists murdered after we pulled out?I remember a lyric by a guy named John Lennon. It said, if you go waving pictures of Chairman Mao, You aint gonna make it with anyone anyhow. Mr. Obama is a great Mao fan. He's said as much on camera. Lennon said: ""If you want money for people with minds that hate, hey buddy, you're gonna just have to wait."" A guy was recently critical of Obama's man in Egypt. He was crucified on the walls of the Egyptian Presidential Palace. We rewarded that behavior with another $2billion. I wonder what David Chase is gonna say about that? Does he want to be Ron Reiner in ""All in the Family?""Ronald Reagan made the world safe from nuclear war. There's only ONE GROUP who wants to use those weapons; Mr. Obama's pals over in Iran. What a shame Mr Chase doesnt have the courage to show who's REALLY READY to use those bombs. Don't feel like a coward, David; no one else in Hollywood has big enough stones, either.
