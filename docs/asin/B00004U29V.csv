I even remember that one of the episodes (the one with the gun) had to be postponed because a few minutes after it started, the program was interrupted by a news story of a plane crash.This show touched something inside of me that no other show ever has.I wish that BMG would release a boxed set with all 19 episodes. I would buy it in an instant.Many of my friends are big fans of this show. But none of us has purchased this DVD, because we are all waiting for a boxed set that has all of the episodes.I know that this DVD has not been selling very well. I worry that the people at BMG may be thinking that this means that there is a lack of interest in the show. If so, then they are mistaken.People aren't avoiding this DVD because they don't like the show. Instead, they are avoiding this DVD because they want a boxed set with all of the episodes.Let's fact it - this series was a very serious, well written, plot-intensive story. Having only 3 of the episodes simply would not make sense. To really be able to appreciate it, you need to watch all of the episodes, in chronological order.So if anyone from BMG is reading this, please take my advice! Please release a boxed set with all 19 episodes! If you do, then the fans of the show will gobble it up and you mill make lots and lots of money!This was a great series, and it deserves to be preserved in its entirety in the DVD format. Let the fans have the opportunity to purchase all of the episodes in one nice, complete package.",5,Please release a boxed set with all 19 episodes!,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,1620,"['love', 'quot', 'So-Called', 'Life.', 'quot', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', '1990s.I', 'watched', '19', 'episodes', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'even', 'remember', 'one', 'episodes', 'one', 'gun', 'had', 'be', 'postponed', 'few', 'minutes', 'started', 'program', 'was', 'interrupted', 'news', 'story', 'plane', 'crash.This', 'show', 'touched', 'something', 'other', 'show', 'ever', 'wish', 'BMG', 'would', 'release', 'boxed', 'set', '19', 'episodes', 'would', 'buy', 'instant.Many', 'friends', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'show', 'none', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'are', 'waiting', 'boxed', 'set', 'episodes.I', 'know', 'DVD', 'not', 'been', 'selling', 'very', 'well', 'worry', 'people', 'BMG', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'lack', 'interest', 'show', 'so', 'then', 'are', 'mistaken.People', 'are', ""n't"", 'avoiding', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'Instead', 'are', 'avoiding', 'DVD', 'want', 'boxed', 'set', 'episodes.Let', 'fact', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'well', 'written', 'plot-intensive', 'story', 'Having', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'need', 'watch', 'episodes', 'chronological', 'order.So', 'anyone', 'BMG', 'reading', 'please', 'take', 'advice', 'Please', 'release', 'boxed', 'set', '19', 'episodes', 'do', 'then', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'gobble', 'up', 'mill', 'make', 'lots', 'lots', 'money', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'be', 'preserved', 'entirety', 'DVD', 'format', 'Let', 'fans', 'have', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'one', 'nice', 'complete', 'package']",N/A

I just recently discovered 'My So-Called Life' last year while flicking through cable and saw A.J Langer as Rayanne, who is one of my all time favourite actors. I then saw Clare Danes come onto the screen (who I'v always liked), and then I saw Jared Leto, while the time I was thinking ''What is this show'', I couldn't help  but notice and be impressed by the humour of it and the true honesty of it. Watching Clare Danes as Angela Chase and her questioning of things and the humour of Rayanne, I really felt that I had stumbled onto something special and unique. Now I'm really femiliar with the show and a definite fan, I have yet to buy this on DVD but I can't wait to be the proud owner of this fine, witty, wonderful show.",5,One of it's Kind,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,789,"['one', 'rare', 'genius', 'smart', 'TV', 'out', 'there', 'just', 'recently', 'discovered', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'last', 'year', 'flicking', 'cable', 'saw', 'A.J', 'Langer', 'Rayanne', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'actors', 'then', 'saw', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'come', 'screen', 'who', ""'"", 'v', 'always', 'liked', 'then', 'saw', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'time', 'was', 'thinking', 'What', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'be', 'impressed', 'humour', 'true', 'honesty', 'Watching', 'Clare', 'Danes', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'questioning', 'things', 'humour', 'Rayanne', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'stumbled', 'something', 'special', 'unique', 'Now', ""'m"", 'really', 'femiliar', 'show', 'definite', 'fan', 'have', 'yet', 'buy', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'proud', 'owner', 'fine', 'witty', 'wonderful', 'show']",N/A

551542,A14XSDTJ3CNOD7,B00004U29V,Saki,"[4, 4]","I really love this show, and I wish that it would have stayed on much longer. Claire Danes was brilliant in every episode, showing promise as an actress that she has yet to deliver on elsewhere. A.J. Langer was memorable, as was everybody else. Each and every episode stands on its own as a 45 minute movie, particularly the first few which set the tone so well. Not until &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; did any other show understand what it was like to be young and get it so perfecftly right in their depiction (though &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; didn't do nearly as well as &quot;My So Called Life&quot;). The shows are entertaining, comical, heart-string-tugging, and sometimes profound in their implications.There have been few shows on television that even aspired to the this level, much less reached it. &quot;My So Called Life&quot; is historic and unmatched.I must admit that much of my motivation in recommending this DVD so highly is purely personal. I bought my copy long ago, just after it came out, and I've been anxiously awaiting further DVD's in the series. To this point I've been disappointed, but I think that if enough people buy this DVD, then perhaps the company will figure out what a hot property they have and release more episodes. Please don't wait for te release of a full boxed set, because if you do there probably won't be one. Follow your heart and buy this. You know you want it.

I have SuperVHS recordings of every episode, and I still plan to buy each DVD that gets released.This is one of the few realistic, quality shows to appear on TV. Many people seem to think the show focuses on the teens, but the adults also have a large part in each episode. The show presents everyone's So-Called Life. ...all ages.I am tempted to disagree with those of you waiting on boxed sets. How can BMG know there is an interest unless people buy what's available? This DVD has previews for 2 future DVDs. I don't expect BMG to be reading the reviews written here so how can we let them know about our interest in the series?
