1397746,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B004EC5ITI,a,"[4, 7]","At first I wondered how a film starring (and executive produced) by a two-time Oscar winner could go straight to DVD. Then I watched the movie and understood completely. Even though ""The Resident"" runs just under 85 minutes before the ending credits, the film seemingly manages to cram in every major horror-thriller-stalker-flick clich&eacute; in the book and then some. They've got it all:--The attractive, emotionally-vulnerable urban professional!--The new, handsome too-good-to-be-true neighbor!--The mysterious ex-boyfriend!--The creepy old man down the hall!--The heavy-breathing, faceless peeping tom!--The supportive African American best friend!--The clanks, the thuds, the billowing curtains, the gasps!--The constant, cranked up eerie music!--Not one, not two, but three partially nude bathroom scenes!--The different-perspective flashback!--The grainy security/home movie footage!--The seemingly immortal ""why won't he just die!"" villain!If designed and played like an homage to B-movie horror films, even with such a talented cast, this may have been enjoyable. Yet it tries too hard to be serious, with a rather sad desire to feel original and give you chills. But it fails with its over-the-top clich&eacute;s, its unresolved back-story, its unused supporting characters, its generic camera angles, and its brief (thankfully, brief) running time of less than 90 minutes. I was disappointed to find that the incredible Christopher Lee's role was little more than six lines in a sort of extended cameo. And while Hilary Swank is as charming and intense as always, I cannot help but scratch my head and wonder why she'd frequently run around semi-or-fully naked for a movie like this one.It might actually be funny upon second viewing, knowing what to expect. Or it might be an intoxicatingly-good drinking game for every time you see Hilary's underwear.

1397749,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B004EC5ITI,Anthony Pittore,"[2, 4]","Decades ago, Hammer Studios produced some of the most legendary horror films in cinematic history.  Their trademark style featured some truly iconic Gothic imagery, along with an almost endless amount of palpable suspense.  Unfortunately, as times changed, so did the desire for Hammer Horror, sadly causing the studio to  close its doors.  Luckily for horror fans, however, Hammer Studios returned in 2008 after a three-decade sabbatical from movies to reclaim its rightful place in the genre.  While it has yet to make its mark on its new modern audience, hope comes with the studio's latest release: 'The Resident.'The first thing many horror fans will notice ab out this new Hammer horror is its very familiar story, which seems to borrow heavily from classics like 'Psycho' and 'Le Locataire.'  This is because, well, it DOES borrow heavily from those films (and others).  While they do have a nice change-up featuring a developing relationship between the stalker and stalkee, it does not vary all that much from other, superior past films.As far as the other aspects of the film, Antti Jokinen's direction is very solid, especially when paired Guillermo Navarro's wonderful cinematography (which has also been featured in gorgeous films like 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'Cronos').  These two talented filmmakers helped to effectively craft both sides of the perverted relationship with some impressive visuals.  In addition to the fine look of the film, the acting is also a pretty fantastic success.  Though I've never been a huge fan of Hilary Swank, even in her award-winning roles, I do understand her talent.  Her general persona has just never been a draw for me.  In this film, for instance, scenes that would be very alluring with another lead simply feel cold & flat.  Still, her talent is undeniable.  The real deal in the film isn't the Oscar winner, though: it's 'Supernatural'-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  His performance as ultra-creepy Max was fantastic.  In a more original movie, his villainous character would have been very much talked about.  Instead, it will only be remembered for what could have been.Overall, Hammer's 'The Resident' is an entertaining & creepy suspense thriller, but does fail to impress in the long run due to its overdone and unoriginal script.  But, this doesn't stop it from being easily worth at least one watch on a popcorn-fueled date night at home, especially for fans of the two leads.Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,Solid performances can't save any otherwise unimpressive thriller,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,2459,"['Decades', 'ago', 'Hammer', 'Studios', 'produced', 'most', 'legendary', 'horror', 'films', 'cinematic', 'history', 'trademark', 'style', 'featured', 'truly', 'iconic', 'Gothic', 'imagery', 'almost', 'endless', 'amount', 'palpable', 'suspense', 'Unfortunately', 'times', 'changed', 'so', 'did', 'desire', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'sadly', 'causing', 'studio', 'close', 'doors', 'Luckily', 'horror', 'fans', 'however', 'Hammer', 'Studios', 'returned', '2008', 'three-decade', 'sabbatical', 'movies', 'reclaim', 'rightful', 'place', 'genre', 'yet', 'make', 'mark', 'new', 'modern', 'audience', 'hope', 'studio', 'latest', 'release', ""'The"", 'Resident', 'first', 'thing', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'notice', 'ab', 'out', 'new', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'classics', ""'Psycho"", 'Locataire', 'because', 'well', 'DOES', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'films', 'others', 'do', 'have', 'nice', 'change-up', 'featuring', 'developing', 'relationship', 'stalker', 'stalkee', 'not', 'vary', 'much', 'other', 'superior', 'past', 'films.As', 'far', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'Antti', 'Jokinen', 'direction', 'very', 'solid', 'especially', 'when', 'paired', 'Guillermo', 'Navarro', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'also', 'been', 'featured', 'gorgeous', 'films', ""'Pan"", 'Labyrinth', ""'Cronos"", 'two', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'helped', 'effectively', 'craft', 'sides', 'perverted', 'relationship', 'impressive', 'visuals', 'addition', 'fine', 'look', 'film', 'acting', 'also', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'success', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'even', 'award-winning', 'roles', 'do', 'understand', 'talent', 'general', 'persona', 'just', 'never', 'been', 'draw', 'film', 'instance', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'alluring', 'lead', 'simply', 'feel', 'cold', 'flat', 'Still', 'talent', 'undeniable', 'real', 'deal', 'film', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'winner', ""'Supernatural'-star"", 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'performance', 'ultra-creepy', 'Max', 'was', 'fantastic', 'more', 'original', 'movie', 'villainous', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'much', 'talked', 'Instead', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'remembered', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.Overall', 'Hammer', ""'The"", 'Resident', 'entertaining', 'creepy', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'fail', 'impress', 'long', 'run', 'due', 'overdone', 'unoriginal', 'script', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'easily', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'watch', 'popcorn-fueled', 'date', 'night', 'home', 'especially', 'fans', 'two', 'leads.Final', 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",N/A
1397750,A1CK5G1VZ7QDRD,B004EC5ITI,A. Thurston,"[1, 2]","Just watched The Resident starring 2 time Academy Award winning actress Hilary Swank .It's from the revised version of the U.K. premier horror film producers Hammer. Here are my thoughts. Good Points : Finnish Director Antii Jokinen has a good eye for colors and images.He makes The Resident a very watchable film as far as scenery goes.The film is set in NYC Brooklyn in particular and Antii makes you feel that you are amidst all that is NYC. The acting by 4/5ths of the cast is quite good.Ms.Swank is fine as the ER doctor Julie as is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as her landlord Max. Aunjanue Ellis as Julies friend Sydney is quite good and in an under developed  role Hammer icon Christopher Lee proves that he still has it. The film is 91 minutes meaning it's not overly long.Now for the bad things: The film is derivative of a slew of previous stalker type thrillers. Nothing in The Resident is something that you haven't seen before. Director Antii Jokinen is not good at pacing a story.He also adds in a dual perspective flashback shot from Max's viewpoint that is more distracting than  productive.It adds no new light other than the fact that Max's father murdered his mother and then killed himself.The writing is awful ,the plot has holes and every non Julie or Max character is under developed. We never get a feel for why Julie and Jack( Lee Pace) split up other than the stereotypical ""I never see you"" or ""We Grew Apart"" .We see that Max is nuts a compulsive stalker with a twisted world view and sexual issues. But nothing in the story really gives a good theory as to why Max becomes obsessed with Julie.His interactions with his Grandfather August played by Christopher Lee don't really explain his motivations either. August calls him weak like his father but there's no elaboration. Lee Pace as Jack is wooden and you see no reason why a woman like Julie would want to rekindle her romance with him.Even Max is a more attractive option and he's nuts. Another writing flaw is that Max comes off sympathetic for about 2/3rds of the film and you start to feel sorry for him which takes away from what he is actually doing to Julie. In a way Julie sets the wheels in motion by coming onto Max and then hitting the brakes right away. Now a lot of men and people in general can relate to being shunned and left hanging in the wind like Max was. This of course in no way justifies Max's stalking ,drugging and assaulting of Julie. But the writers make it seem as in some way Julie has it coming for leading Max on. It's funny too how Ms.Swank who's in great physical shape takes pride in showing the viewers that fact by jogging several times. stretching to show off her muscle tone and giving fleeting glimpses of her naked body  But I do think Hilary does have a great smile which she flashes several times in the film.Overall The Resident is disappointing in that it should have been much better than it came out.Swank is a fine actress and Morgan who I was not familiar with prior to this film is a good actor with a great voice. Hopefully Hammer will keep on making more films but one hopes that they are better than The Resident was.",2,"Some good ,some bad",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,3145,"['Just', 'watched', 'Resident', 'starring', '2', 'time', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Hilary', 'Swank', '.It', 'revised', 'version', 'U.K.', 'premier', 'horror', 'film', 'producers', 'Hammer', 'Here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'Good', 'Points', 'Finnish', 'Director', 'Antii', 'Jokinen', 'good', 'eye', 'colors', 'images.He', 'Resident', 'very', 'watchable', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'scenery', 'goes.The', 'film', 'set', 'NYC', 'Brooklyn', 'particular', 'Antii', 'feel', 'are', 'amidst', 'NYC', 'acting', '4/5ths', 'cast', 'quite', 'good.Ms.Swank', 'fine', 'ER', 'doctor', 'Julie', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'landlord', 'Max', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'Julies', 'friend', 'Sydney', 'quite', 'good', 'developed', 'role', 'Hammer', 'icon', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'still', 'film', '91', 'minutes', 'meaning', 'not', 'overly', 'long.Now', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'derivative', 'slew', 'previous', 'stalker', 'type', 'thrillers', 'Nothing', 'Resident', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Director', 'Antii', 'Jokinen', 'not', 'good', 'pacing', 'story.He', 'also', 'dual', 'perspective', 'flashback', 'shot', 'Max', 'viewpoint', 'more', 'distracting', 'productive.It', 'new', 'light', 'other', 'fact', 'Max', 'father', 'murdered', 'mother', 'then', 'killed', 'himself.The', 'writing', 'awful', 'plot', 'holes', 'non', 'Julie', 'Max', 'character', 'developed', 'never', 'get', 'feel', 'why', 'Julie', 'Jack', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'split', 'up', 'other', 'stereotypical', 'never', 'see', 'Grew', 'Apart', '.We', 'see', 'Max', 'nuts', 'compulsive', 'stalker', 'twisted', 'world', 'view', 'sexual', 'issues', 'nothing', 'story', 'really', 'good', 'theory', 'why', 'Max', 'obsessed', 'Julie.His', 'interactions', 'Grandfather', 'August', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'motivations', 'August', 'weak', 'father', 'elaboration', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Jack', 'wooden', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'woman', 'Julie', 'would', 'want', 'rekindle', 'romance', 'him.Even', 'Max', 'more', 'attractive', 'option', 'nuts', 'writing', 'flaw', 'Max', 'off', 'sympathetic', '2/3rds', 'film', 'start', 'feel', 'sorry', 'away', 'what', 'actually', 'doing', 'Julie', 'way', 'Julie', 'wheels', 'motion', 'coming', 'Max', 'then', 'hitting', 'brakes', 'right', 'away', 'Now', 'lot', 'men', 'people', 'general', 'can', 'relate', 'being', 'shunned', 'left', 'hanging', 'wind', 'Max', 'was', 'course', 'way', 'Max', 'stalking', 'drugging', 'assaulting', 'Julie', 'writers', 'make', 'way', 'Julie', 'coming', 'leading', 'Max', 'funny', 'too', 'how', 'Ms.Swank', 'who', 'great', 'physical', 'shape', 'pride', 'showing', 'viewers', 'fact', 'jogging', 'several', 'times', 'stretching', 'show', 'off', 'muscle', 'tone', 'giving', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'naked', 'body', 'do', 'think', 'Hilary', 'have', 'great', 'smile', 'several', 'times', 'film.Overall', 'Resident', 'disappointing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'came', 'fine', 'actress', 'Morgan', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'prior', 'film', 'good', 'actor', 'great', 'voice', 'Hopefully', 'Hammer', 'will', 'keep', 'making', 'more', 'films', 'one', 'are', 'better', 'Resident', 'was']",N/A

1397752,A1D9V11QUHXENQ,B004EC5ITI,"Big Al ""Alan Rivire""","[0, 1]","**Spoiler Alert**  This review may contain spoilersIn this pyscho-thriller, Hilary Swank plays a New York ER doctor Dr. Juliet Devereau, caught in a love triangle which involves her charming landlord Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and her ex-boyfriend Jack (Lee Pace). Except for an occasional shot through peepholes and a one-way mirror and the strange behavior of Max's grandpa (Christoper Lee), the first third of the film feels like a romantic movie rather than a thriller. Jeffrey Morgan plays the psycho-killer Max deftly. However, the switch of Max from a charmer to a killer seems abrupt; the script didn't provide much room for Jeffery Morgon to develop the character of Max. Hilary Swank plays a smart and independent professional woman, who is overjoyed of her good fortune in finding a spacious apartment at a bargain rental fee. Unbeknownst to her, her nightmare just begins. Hilary Swank is a fabulous actress who brings forth the plight of a stalker victim vividly. First time director Antti Jokinen created an atmosphere in which the audience seems to be watching Juliet secretly in her own apartment. A small part of the story is told twice through the eyes of Juliet and Max respectively, which reminds me of the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon. The film is well acted, directed and photographed, but the story is thin and sometimes unbelievable, and the characters are shallow. The film can use a more in-depth study of the psychology and motivation of a psycho-killer. The ending is a letdown.

Without giving away any plot details let me just say that the mystery angle of the film is spoiled early-on by the revealing of the protagonist. Then we are basically just watching to see when Hilary Swank's character catches on to what we already know. The great Christopher Lee is sadly only in the film all too briefly and is not given much to do. Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are both good but are limited by the poor script. Hilary Swank seems to spend a lot of time undressing and bathing. This is probably one of the most interesting things about the film. It seemed to go on for much longer than the running time of 91 minutes. It would have been much better suited to an episode of an hour-long t.v. series than as a feature-length film.

The acting was well done by both main characters although I was sad that Christoper Lee didn't have a bigger part in the film.  The pacing is nicely done.  The movie wastes no time getting to Juliet getting the willies about her new apartment.  The apartment is nicely done too.  The lighting in the apartment casts shadows and it is difficult to tell if someone is there or not.  The camera shows different viewpoints from the drain and other areas as seen through his eyes.  There were also some other creepy moments like when she is laying in bed. The ending is predictable but well done.  Both main characters get blows in and also receive blows in the final confrontation.My only  little peeve with the movie is that we never know why he picks her.  He sees her at the hospital trying to save someone's life then...wow I just gotta have her.  So the attraction was somewhat sudden.

I think THE RESIDENT has a lot more to offer than it's given credit for. Is the film predictable? Of course, most ""women in peril"" films usually are from the basic set-up to the inevitable conclusion. Is it suspenseful? Not as much as many thrillers I can name but then I don't think that's the main point of the film. It's more about a portrait of perversion done in the style of the classic M and the (reviled at the time) British horror film PEEPING TOM than standard thrillers like THE ROOMMATE or PACIFIC HEIGHTS. In other words, it's creepy.The basic scenario is as follows. Single female rents a too good to be true apartment and then has cause to regret it thanks to a psychotic individual who has designs on her. Nothing new here but the way it's handled in THE RESIDENT I found more far more unsettling than in most of the films in this category. THE RESIDENT is extremely well crafted from the editing and the camerawork down to the eerie and effective score. The script doesn't probe deeply into psychological issues but as voiced by Hilary Swank, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and the 88 year old Christopher Lee, it kept me engaged. Another plus (or maybe not depending on your POV) is that it has a very high ""ewww"" factor.THE RESIDENT also reminded me of some the classic Hammer ""mini-Hitchcocks"" made during the 1960s and early 70s like DIE DIE MY DARLING and CRESCENDO both of which star Stefanie Powers who Swank bears a superficial resemblance to. Christopher Lee makes the most of his limited scenes, but it is Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his portrait of the disturbed landlord that gives THE RESIDENT its resonance. He starts off like Anthony Perkins in PSYCHO and winds up like Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION. The scene where he brushes his teeth with Swank's toothbrush I found as chilling as anything else in the film. But that's only one of the many disturbing things he does. While the ending is rushed and formulaic, it's to be expected in a glorified B picture which is what THE RESIDENT is.This is only the third film to be released by the newly revived Hammer Films. LET ME IN, the remake of the Swedish vampire film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, garnered mostly positive reviews but tanked due to mismarketing and a backlash from fans of the original. WAKE WOOD, a film similar in nature to THE WICKER MAN, has already come out on Region 2 DVD. Although all three carry on the Hammer tradition of quality films on a limted budget, they are having trouble finding American distribution which is what killed the original company in the first place. The remake of THE WOMAN IN BLACK with Daniel Radcliffe which is scheduled for release later this year should not have that problem and will hopefully be the hit that Hammer needs to have.",4,PEEPING TOM...50 Years Later.,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,2941,"['movie', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'U.S', 'only', 'recently', 'opened', 'U.K', 'Most', 'U.S.', 'reviews', 'have', 'ranged', 'fair', 'terrible', 'can', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'think', 'RESIDENT', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'given', 'credit', 'film', 'predictable', 'course', 'most', 'women', 'peril', 'films', 'usually', 'are', 'basic', 'set-up', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'suspenseful', 'Not', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'thrillers', 'can', 'name', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'more', 'portrait', 'perversion', 'done', 'style', 'classic', 'M', 'reviled', 'time', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'standard', 'thrillers', 'THE', 'ROOMMATE', 'PACIFIC', 'HEIGHTS', 'other', 'words', 'creepy.The', 'basic', 'scenario', 'Single', 'female', 'rents', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'apartment', 'then', 'cause', 'regret', 'psychotic', 'individual', 'who', 'designs', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'way', 'handled', 'THE', 'RESIDENT', 'found', 'more', 'far', 'more', 'unsettling', 'most', 'films', 'category', 'RESIDENT', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'editing', 'camerawork', 'down', 'eerie', 'effective', 'score', 'script', ""n't"", 'probe', 'deeply', 'psychological', 'issues', 'voiced', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', '88', 'year', 'old', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'kept', 'engaged', 'plus', 'maybe', 'not', 'depending', 'POV', 'very', 'high', 'ewww', 'factor.THE', 'RESIDENT', 'also', 'reminded', 'classic', 'Hammer', 'mini-Hitchcocks', 'made', '1960s', 'early', '70s', 'DIE', 'DIE', 'MY', 'DARLING', 'CRESCENDO', 'star', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'who', 'Swank', 'superficial', 'resemblance', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'most', 'limited', 'scenes', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'portrait', 'disturbed', 'landlord', 'RESIDENT', 'resonance', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'PSYCHO', 'up', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'scene', 'where', 'teeth', 'Swank', 'toothbrush', 'found', 'as', 'chilling', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'disturbing', 'things', 'ending', 'rushed', 'formulaic', 'be', 'expected', 'glorified', 'B', 'picture', 'what', 'THE', 'RESIDENT', 'is.This', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'newly', 'revived', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'LET', 'ME', 'IN', 'remake', 'Swedish', 'vampire', 'film', 'LET', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'ONE', 'IN', 'garnered', 'mostly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'tanked', 'due', 'mismarketing', 'backlash', 'fans', 'original', 'WAKE', 'WOOD', 'film', 'similar', 'nature', 'THE', 'WICKER', 'MAN', 'already', 'come', 'out', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'three', 'carry', 'Hammer', 'tradition', 'quality', 'films', 'limted', 'budget', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'finding', 'American', 'distribution', 'what', 'killed', 'original', 'company', 'first', 'place', 'remake', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'scheduled', 'release', 'later', 'year', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'hit', 'Hammer', 'have']",N/A

1397763,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B004EC5ITI,David J. Brown,"[2, 5]","No one could be more excited when the news that Hammer Studios was rolling back into existance and already had two feature films in the pipelines for release in 2010!  While my excitement has wained since, but still there, and for good reason.  Frist is The Resident, a stalker thriller that got a very limited theatrical release despite the fact that Oscar Winner Hillary Swank is the star.  Their second release was a remake, EEEEEKKKK, of a brilliant film called Let the Right One In, the remake being called Let Me In.  A remake and a standard stalker thriller?  Interesting choices, but where's the gothic horror I yearn for?  I guess I'll have to wait for Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's collaboration on the feature film version Dark Shadows.Okay, now this film has so many good things in it it's hard to knock it too hard.  The acting is all top notch.  Swank is convincing as a surgeon and as her stalker's unaware victim.  Unfortunately, her character is only defined by her job and the fact that the love of her life has cheated on her, and forced her to move out and find a place to be on her own.  Yeah, there's not much of a character written here.  Luckily, Swank is a charismatic enough presence to fool you into thinking you're watching a fully developed human being.  She's quite likeable and instantly garners the viewer's sympathy.  Then we have the stalker, played here by Jeffrey Dean Morgan(The Comedian in Watchmen).  He is good, but again is short shrifted by the screenplay.  His character's past is given to us.  A past of abuse at the hands of his grandfather, played by Christopher Lee, in a far too small and wasted role.  He just has to play charming and then switch into stalker and eventually into the motor of a conventional slasher movie cliche.  He's good, but not totally as menacing as you would need in the last moments when the film really starts to heat up.The film is beautifully shot by Guillermo Navarro(a frequent collaborator of the brilliant Guillermo Del Toro).  It's just nice to look at, in that lived in and aunthentic way.  The production design feels mostly natural.  I mean, Swank's new place is huge and almost creepily gothic, but that's just something one has to expect in a film like this.  I would like to see the creepy apartment thriller film where the apartment complex is as ordinary as the characters, but I digress.  It's fast paced and edited well.  It's visually stimulating, but that's it.  All surface.  Not really that disturbing.  Not that surprising.The only thing that really intrigued me with this this film is the first two acts' structure.  Without hint or preview the point of view of the film shifts from Swank's unknowing stalked to that of the stalker. Not completely Roshimon style, but the film suddenly decides to tell us, like we didn't know already, that the Jeffrey Dean Morgan character has been stalking and been in scenes featuring just Swank, like a steamy bath.  He peeps through holes.  He hides under beds.  He creeps through her apartment in the middle of the night, in through secret passageways....yeah, you've seen this all before.  I do give credit to one other moment that is played mostly off of Swank's face in the third act as she is looking at her home security footage to find Morgan molesting her.  It's a dynamic and horrifying scene well performed by Swank and truly disturbing.  The only really disturbing scene in the whole film.Yes, it's predicatable but not insulting.  It's not original, but not too common of a genre that it's totally tired.  The acting is top notch and it's visually appealing and manipulative like all good thrillers/horror films should be.  So, give it a rent and check it out.Finally, the blu ray itself is totally bare-bones.  Not even a trailer makes an appearance.  The film and Navarro's brilliant cinematography looks great on blu ray, but I would've liked some interviews or behind the scenes stuff, or even a featurette about the return of Hammer horror.  Oh well.  At least they got the sound and picture right.PS: Is it just me or does anyone else out there in la-la land think Hillary Swank's sexy?

She's looking to reboot her life after her boyfriend cheated on her. Her new landlord seems nice, maybe too nice, and she's somewhat attracted to him. Turns out he's a stalker in sheep's clothing. He spies on her, drugs her wine, visits her while she sleeps. This is one sick, creepy dude. She starts to sense something's wrong and makes moves to figure it all out.I'm a Hilary Swank fan and she doesn't disappoint here. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is very good as the landlord. Lee Pace has too small a role as Swank's beau. It's shot well, cut well, good music and sound design. It's just doesn't come together. It's slow, and something in the story lacks dynamic quality. Then you get to the climax and it gets pretty stupid. It runs on too long. The landlord turns into the thing that wouldn't die and Swank can't get a good enough signal on her cell phone to call for help.

The idea for the film is OK but the script written by Robert Orr and director Jokinen is so slim that the film could have been a successful short: everything you need to know is in the trailer.  A thriller it is not, but the people in the film are so attractive that much is forgivable.Hard working ER Doctor/Surgeon Juliet Devereau (Hilary Swank - who also is executive producer here) is bruised by a broken relationship: Jack (Lee Pace, well remembered for his role in 'A Soldier's Girl') betrayed their relationship. Juliet needs a change and looks for an apartment in New York City, eventually finding an affordable gorgeous space being renovated by owner Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, handsome and charismatic).  Max is strange but pleasant and goes out of his way to please Juliet.  Max lives in the apartment house as does his grandfather August (Christopher Lee), and when the emotionally vulnerable Juliet is attracted to Max, Max is the one who shuts down. But the chemistry has begun and Max spies on Juliet, stalking her, making videos of her in bath, obsessing over her etc.  Juliet meanwhile reconnects with Jack, a fact that motivates Max to change the direction of his approach to Juliet.  What follows is a series of strange incidents that the audience will know about ahead of time and the ending just sort of happens - without much suspense or caring from the viewer.Swank is up to par in her professionalism and both Morgan and Pace are interesting to watch. The film has some nice effects and the cast is attractive  and maybe that is enough for a no-brainer film.  Pleasant but non-involving.

A lot of work has been done to restore the historic hot spot: new wood floors, wine closet, floor-to-ceiling windows, and enough secret tunnels, peepholes, hidden doors, and ways to spy on his tenants that the previous owner was probably Michael Jackson.Sounds a lot like a poor man's Sliver, right?  Except Morgan is no Baldwin brother, and comparing Swank to 1993 Sharon Stone is laughable at best.Well, there isn't much deviation from the source material, but there is a little spice thrown in with a People Under the Stairs motif.  Which I liked.Some wonderful cinematography (Guillermo Navarro) and framing of the limitlessly diverse New York scenery serves as the true suspense of the movie, as it's readily apparent what's going to happen from beginning to end.  There is a tired subplot involving ex-boyfriend fodder and Max's disapproving geriatric grandfather, but no actual effort is made explaining Max's actions.  Instead, there are questions aplenty left unanswered, and despite the performances of two fine co-leads, the end result is somewhat enjoyable, yet uninspired and predictable.",3,"Red, red wine...",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1303,"['Attractive', 'single', 'doctor', 'Juliet', 'Devereau', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Brooklyn', 'impossibly', 'convenient', 'spacious', 'affordable', 'loft', 'handsome', 'landlord/owner', 'named', 'Max', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'lot', 'work', 'been', 'done', 'restore', 'historic', 'hot', 'spot', 'new', 'wood', 'floors', 'wine', 'closet', 'floor-to-ceiling', 'windows', 'enough', 'secret', 'tunnels', 'peepholes', 'hidden', 'doors', 'ways', 'spy', 'tenants', 'previous', 'owner', 'was', 'probably', 'Michael', 'Jackson.Sounds', 'lot', 'poor', 'man', 'Sliver', 'right', 'Morgan', 'Baldwin', 'brother', 'comparing', 'Swank', '1993', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'laughable', 'best.Well', ""n't"", 'much', 'deviation', 'source', 'material', 'little', 'spice', 'thrown', 'People', 'Stairs', 'motif', 'Which', 'liked.Some', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'Guillermo', 'Navarro', 'framing', 'limitlessly', 'diverse', 'New', 'York', 'scenery', 'true', 'suspense', 'movie', 'readily', 'apparent', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'beginning', 'end', 'tired', 'subplot', 'involving', 'ex-boyfriend', 'fodder', 'Max', 'disapproving', 'geriatric', 'grandfather', 'actual', 'effort', 'made', 'explaining', 'Max', 'actions', 'Instead', 'are', 'questions', 'aplenty', 'left', 'unanswered', 'performances', 'two', 'fine', 'co-leads', 'end', 'result', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'yet', 'uninspired', 'predictable']",N/A
1397767,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B004EC5ITI,J. B. Hoyos,"[2, 4]","Juliet Devereau (Hilary Swank, ""The Reaping"") is an ER doctor who recently divorced her husband Jack (Lee Pace, ""Possession"") for committing adultery.  She moves into a Brooklyn brownstone that is being renovated by the owner/landlord Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, ""Watchmen"") and his elderly grandfather August (Christopher Lee, ""Horror Express"").  Reasonably rented at $3,800 per month, the large apartment seems too good to be true.  It most definitely is!  A train runs beneath the building and cell phone reception is poor but, worse of all, someone is hiding in secret passages, watching Juliet through peep holes.  Then the spying turns to touching, molesting and, finally, to killing.My collection of Hammer films is extremely vast.  Hammer is most famous for their low-budget gothic horror films which had their heyday during the late fifties to early seventies.  Legendary horror actor Christopher Lee starred in numerous Hammer films; he is best known for his portrayal as the most handsome sensual vampire of all time, Count Dracula.  Unfortunately, Hammer went out of business in the mid-seventies.  Christopher Lee starred in their last gothic film, ""To the Devil a Daughter,"" which also starred Natasha Kinski.  However, like the vampire itself, Hammer has been resurrected.  Recently, they released the highly successful vampire film ,""Let Me In,"" an American remake of the Swedish classic, ""Let the Right One in.""  I was honored to review another one of their latest, ""The Resident.""Reminiscent of Hammer's women-in-peril classics such as ""Die! Die! My Darling,"" ""Straight on Till Morning"" and ""Fear in the Night,"" ""The Resident"" stars Hilary Swank as the super fit, super intelligent doctor who is more independent than the other females in Hammer's previous women-in-peril films.  However, loneliness and confusion make her vulnerable.  Juliet yearns for the sexy, hunky landlord Max but still pines for her equally accomplished ex-husband Jack.  Honestly, Juliet seems to spend too much time in the ER and jogging, as though training for the triathlon; her neglected, lonely husband probably sought solace in the arms of another woman.  Speaking of loneliness, Max is also lonely, having spent most of his time being abused by his overbearing grandfather Max.  Consequently, Max spies on his tenants from the secret passages built around the individual apartments.  Loneliness is a deadly emotion that can lead to insanity and murder.I found ""The Resident"" to be a highly stressful, nerve-racking experience.  The final showdown with the nail gun is one for the horror annals.  A pounding rock score from John Ottman, wonderful direction from Antti J. Jokinen, great acting from all the leads, and a creepy, Brooklyn setting make ""The Resident"" a great late-night horror film.  As a personal treat to myself, I watched ""The Resident"" on Friday 13th.  In regards to other voyeuristic films I've watched, I enjoyed it much better than ""Sliver,"" starring Sharon Stone and William Baldwin, but not as much as the most excellent ""Crawlspace,"" starring Klaus Kinski, father of Natasha Kinski.  In ""Crawlspace,"" a Nazi doctor spies on his female tenants while murdering their lovers; it has gruesome deaths, a high body count and a beautiful piano score from Pino Dinoggio (""Carrie,"" ""The Howling"" and ""Piranha"").My only complaint is not about the film itself but its mediocre presentation from Image Entertainment.  It lacks special features such as a ""Making Of Featurette,"" ""Deleted Scenes,"" ""Outtakes,"" etc.  However, it does have a trailer for the subject film plus two others:  In ""The Reef,"" survivors of a capsized boat are terrorized by sharks.  In ""Chain Letter,"" a chain-wielding psychopath murders teens who have broken an internet chain letter.  Thankfully, the film has English SDH and Spanish subtitles and a theatrical widescreen presentation of 2.35:1.  However, I do wish that Anchor Bay had released this film.  I love watching featurettes depicting how a horror film was made, especially if they have a lot of special effects.  I would've liked to know how much of the film was actually filmed in New York and how much was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.""The Resident"" is a must see for all Hammer fans.  I hope to see more releases from this studio.  It is also recommended for those who enjoy women-in-peril films.  Most especially, I recommend it to fans of the legendary Christopher Lee who has starred in over a hundred films, most of them horror.  Though I wished his role had been greater, it was a very important one.  He was superb as the condescending, abusive grandfather, August.  I hope to see him in more horror films from Hammer.Joseph B.

Any film buff worth his salt knows about Hammer's illustrious history of producing low budget and unique films during the 50's. 60's and early 70's.  But during the mid-70's, the studio went pear shape and stopped making films after their brief collaboration with Shaw Brothers Studios.  But it's the 10's and Hammer is back with it's second film (the first one was Let Me In).  Unfortunately, 2011's offering is The Resident.The movie stars Hillary Swank (who is one of the producers of the film) as Juliet (looking quite sinewy) , a Doctor who's desperately looking for a new place to live after a break up with her boyfriend.  After find a few places that weren't quite up to her standards, she finds her dream home, a flat that is being remodeled by Max, a handsome middle aged dude who shares the building with his grandfather August (the great Christopher Lee and notable Hammer veteran).  Soon Juliet and Max become a pair until the two Exes decide to ""work things out"".  Max doesn't take to kindly to this and his obsession with Juliet and reach a nasty and brutal conclusion.I found the movie to be ""okay"".  I mean this latest production didn't dredge up any memories of the classic Hammer Films (except the few mediocre ones that they put out).

She finds the ideal place that is afforable and has a hot landlord who really cares about his tenants. Once she moves someone starts watching/stalking her but who could it be? You see Hillary's character going through the same routine every night which is boring. Also it doesn't take long for the movie to let you know exactly who it is which is an EPIC FAIL!!These are the reasons that this movie falls really short:1. Very predictable2.

1397777,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EC5ITI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Reviving the legend of Hammer films certainly seemed like a great idea. Renowned for their creepiness and monster mayhem, Hammer was one of the most influential horror players in the film industry for approximately four decades (most relevantly, perhaps, in the fifties and sixties). Their 1958 version of ""Dracula"" with Christopher Lee is still considered by many to be the definitive film version of this oft told tale. Well, Hammer is back in the game! Their first release was the contemplative vampire remake ""Let Me In,"" a terrific film that owes far more to its Swedish predecessor than to the mystique and allure of Hammer. Their follow-up film ""The Resident,"" however, is pure Hammer--unfortunately, it's late period schlock as opposed to something that's going to reinvigorate the legend.Hilary Swank, with her two Oscars firmly in storage somewhere, plays a New York doctor seemingly defined by the male relationships in her life. After a difficult break-up, she does what any single lady would do--she rents a cavernously creepy new apartment and begins a tentative flirtation with her landlord (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). In a bit of casting fun, Lee is even on hand as Morgan's grandfather--but, in reality, he has very little to do. This is the type of film that is entirely reliant on the fact that someone could be four feet away from you in your creaky old flat and you wouldn't notice. You see, Swank is being watched and the unknown assailant has full access to her apartment. Amidst the copious scenes of peeping, (look, here's Swank bathing and here she is applying liberal amounts of lotion to her breasts--did I mention she had two Oscars) things start to progress to more intimate aggressions.The set-up, when revealed a third of the way through, is fairly preposterous as the entire plot is predicated on about 48 random decisions coinciding exactly. There are several big leaps of faith. Swank feels slightly uneasy--one second later, she has a state of the art video monitoring system installed (there are several large transitions that defy logic) and her pursuer neither notices the new system or the big computer that indicates when video has been shot. The big finale plays out pretty much along expected lines as well. This is an easy film to watch, I suppose, as a brain dead creation. It might have been better served, however, without the baggage an A-list cast brings. After a promising beginning, however, it's hard to take much too seriously here. There have been countless films with exactly the same premise that have preceded ""The Resident"" with varying degrees of success. The film doesn't offer much uniqueness to distinguish itself--and modern audiences seeking a horror product will likely be disappointed that this is more of a cheesy thriller. Watchable, but forgettable.

The Resident is somewhat of the latter as it was a novel idea but executed with a half effort.The Resident is a relatively unique idea for the story as it revolves a creepy stalker renting out a room.  This is nice in that it proves that watching someone sleep with dreamy eyes is NOT romantic, it's being a stalker (You hear that Twilight fans?  It's not cute!  It's called stalking!!).  It brought about some moments of tension but they didn't last long and they were few and far in between.  The film didn't quite grab me the way I wanted to.Don't get me wrong; Swank, Morgan, and Lee were great as they have always been.  It truly was an all-star cast with a two-time academy award winner, The Comedian, and a Bond villain.

1397783,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B004EC5ITI,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","Director Antti Jokinen from Finland graduated from East Carolina University and has made a name for himself directing music videos.  This landed him a directorial spot on ""The Resident"" which boasts its star Hilary Swank as an executive producer.  Unfortunately, the screenplay does not hold up well.  We get to know Hilary's character Juliet Devereau, apparently an emergency room physician, who has recently broken up with Jack played by Lee Pace.  The breakup causes her to live in a hotel and search for an apartment.  The too-good-to-be-true deal that Max, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, offers proves exactly that.  Morgan was in ""P.S. I Love You"" and had a reoccurring role as Katherine Heigl's boyfriend on ""Grey's Anatomy.""  In the first act of the film, we see a budding attraction between landlord and tenant, which comes to the cusp of consummation, but something seems weird.  Act II begins and we telescopically have reverse action that takes us back to the hospital where we see Jeffrey Dean Morgan spotting Swank and grabbing her number off a bulletin board about the apartment.  Swank wants to be just friends with Morgan and rekindles her romance with Pace.  There didn't seem to be much spark between Pace and Swank.  Then the third act comes where suddenly Swank's unease in her apartment causes her to install a security monitoring system.  The gold scene in the film is watching Swank look at her own violation on the computer and breaking down entirely.  Meanwhile, Morgan for some unknown reason wakes up and decides he'll kill his grandfather, August, played by Christopher Lee.  Lee's haunting weird intensity was a plus for the film, but didn't seem to propel the story.  The film comes to its smashing conclusion and promptly goes to credits without denouement.  While the actors handle the performances well enough, the screenplay is so clunky that it does not survive as a good movie.

1397792,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B004EC5ITI,Nathan T.,"[17, 29]","""The Resident"" is 2011 drama/horror/thriller film that basically puts an emphasis on the saying ""if it's too good to be true, it probably is"".It is about a woman (Juliet Dermer played by Hilary Swank) that goes looking for an apartment to stay at, eventually finds one that is just too good to be true; affordable, extremely spacious and not only that, the landlord is a good-looking, charming man that cares for his tenants (no, really, a landlord that cares!). The landlord (Max played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), however, ends up forming a dangerous obsession to Juliet and the movie trailer pretty much sums up the whole thing. Everything you see in the official movie trailer for this movie is pretty much what the movie is like.Two stars is actually a generous rating in my opinion because this movie did not succeed in anything that it was meant to succeed in.The movie failed for a few reasons.Reason 1: I think this reason is ESPECIALLY true for me, but the villain, Max, is too good looking. He plays the role of a sick, invasive, and mentally unstable pervert that peeks through hidden crevices in the wall throughout the apartment. Or at least he's SUPPOSE to seem that way. However, the way he looks and the way he acts never truly gives me that impression. Usually, the role of the villain in question is suppose to be fulfilled by a sickly looking man that's not so attractive and is more suspicious looking. Personally, I wanted Juliet to dump Jack, her boyfriend/ex? and go with Max.Reason 2: The plot and storyline of the movie is incredibly straightforward and predictable. There was definitely no mystery in who the villain is as it is clearly revealed fairly early in the story. So due to that, you never remain alert to the details to the movie because the main perpetrator has already been revealed. The ending held no surprises and the action scenes lack all sense of suspense.Reason 3: Drama, horror, thriller. Was the movie dramatic and made me feel connected to the character? No. Did the movie scare me or give me the sense of being horrified? No. Did it contain suspenseful, thrilling moments that put me on the edge of my seat wondering what'll come next? No. Predictable from beginning to end.Throughout the movie, you'll probably be thinking ""oh I've seen that before"".Don't watch the trailer, it's basically the whole movie compressed.

She comes across a huge apartment at a bargain rate. (Warning one-If you get an amazing bargain in NYC, something bad is about to happen!)She rents the apartment from Jeffery Dean Morgan (who I wail always remember as ""dead Denny"" in Gray's Anatomy which spoiled that entire series for me forever) is the landlord and as the viewer finds out early in the movie he is a combination stalker/pervert/peeping tom/sex addict/psycho/killer who spends more time sneaking around Hilary's apartment than she does. He also has multiple viewing areas into the apartment which allow him to view Swank at his leisure. He can watch her as she bathes, cooks, sleeps and drinks. (which is part of her problem. ER doctors need to be careful about drinking too much)Christopher Lee is totally wasted in his role as the grandfather of Morgan who starts off as a spooky old man and ends up as a dead one.Lee Pace is Swank's ex boyfriend who manages to rekindle his romance with her and anyone who has ever seen a suspense cum horror film knows what happens to that kind of person. No surprise here.The last 20 minutes of this film is tediously filled with Swank taking down her landlord in a knock down drag out ridiculous physical battle and him rising again like Michael Myers in the Halloween films. I get so tired of heroines who never watch one of the films over the last 50 years where you knock the bad guy down, run away and have him pop up again in the most unlikely spots. Eventually Swank prevails, the bad guy is dead, the old man is dead, the boyfriend is dead and the movie simply ends.

Strong words indeed, especially in a year that saw the release of such gems as Baby Shower, Red State, The Inheritance, The Human Centipede 2, A Haunting in Salem... I could go on naming worse horror films from 2011 for the entirely of this review. Which, I hasten to add, does not mean The Resident is a GOOD movie--it's just not as terrible as some folks would have you believe.Jokinen, a TV and documentary director working on his first feature, gives us the story of Juliet Devereaux (Million Dollar Baby's Hilary Swank), a doctor currently on the outs with her boyfriend and looking for a cheap place to live while she completes her residency. She finds what seems to be the perfect apartment (and let's be real here, that's not an apartment, that's a damn duplex) in a house owned and maintained by hunky Max (Watchmen's Jeffrey Dean Morgan). The two seem as if they might be getting off on the right foot, but when the ex re-enters the picture, Max ramps up the woo he's pitching in, shall we say, not the most up-front of ways...I guess I can kind of understand the venom; this was supposed to be Hammer Films' big comeback in the horror genre, and to say the least, it isn't. Jokinen was probably not the right director for this, first of all; his lush camerawork would have felt much more at home in a costume drama than a claustrophobic horror film. (The disastrous 1999 The Haunting remake had this same problem: if you spend more time admiring the architecture than paying attention to the plot...) Morgan did make a solid bad guy--in fact, the entire cast did as good a job as they could with substandard material, and I only touched the tip of the casting iceberg here (Aunjanue Ellis, Christopher Lee [in his first Hammer film in thirty-five years], Nana Visitor, and Michael Badalucco all make appearances)--but that phrase can be qualified with ""as long as the script stayed plausible"", which died out around two-thirds of the way through the movie. And, in the end, the whole thing felt like a weird, not-quite-ripoff of the 1978 sexy-day-real-estate movie The Sentinel, albeit without the Satanic angle.So, yeah, not the worst horror film of 2011... but it could have been so much better than it actually is. **",2,Should have spent a couple more years as an intern.,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2430,"['Resident', 'Antti', 'Jokinen', '2011', 'saw', 'number', 'articles', 'close', '2011', 'were', 'strident', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'virulent', 'choosing', 'Resident', 'single', 'worst', 'horror', 'film', '2011', 'Strong', 'words', 'indeed', 'especially', 'year', 'saw', 'release', 'such', 'gems', 'Baby', 'Shower', 'Red', 'State', 'Inheritance', 'Human', 'Centipede', '2', 'Haunting', 'Salem', 'could', 'go', 'naming', 'worse', 'horror', 'films', '2011', 'entirely', 'review', 'Which', 'hasten', 'add', 'not', 'mean', 'Resident', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'terrible', 'folks', 'would', 'have', 'believe.Jokinen', 'TV', 'documentary', 'director', 'working', 'first', 'feature', 'story', 'Juliet', 'Devereaux', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'doctor', 'currently', 'outs', 'boyfriend', 'looking', 'cheap', 'place', 'live', 'residency', 'what', 'be', 'perfect', 'apartment', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'here', 'not', 'apartment', 'damn', 'duplex', 'house', 'owned', 'maintained', 'hunky', 'Max', 'Watchmen', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'two', 'seem', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'off', 'right', 'foot', 'when', 'ex', 'picture', 'Max', 'up', 'woo', 'pitching', 'shall', 'say', 'not', 'most', 'up-front', 'ways', 'guess', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'venom', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'big', 'comeback', 'horror', 'genre', 'say', 'least', ""n't"", 'Jokinen', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'right', 'director', 'first', 'lush', 'camerawork', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'home', 'costume', 'drama', 'claustrophobic', 'horror', 'film', 'disastrous', '1999', 'Haunting', 'remake', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'admiring', 'architecture', 'paying', 'attention', 'plot', 'Morgan', 'did', 'make', 'solid', 'bad', 'guy', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'could', 'substandard', 'material', 'only', 'touched', 'tip', 'casting', 'iceberg', 'here', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'Christopher', 'Lee', '[', 'first', 'Hammer', 'film', 'thirty-five', 'years', ']', 'Nana', 'Visitor', 'Michael', 'Badalucco', 'make', 'appearances', 'phrase', 'can', 'be', 'qualified', 'as', 'long', 'script', 'stayed', 'plausible', 'died', 'out', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'end', 'whole', 'thing', 'felt', 'weird', 'not-quite-ripoff', '1978', 'sexy-day-real-estate', 'movie', 'Sentinel', 'Satanic', 'angle.So', 'yeah', 'not', 'worst', 'horror', 'film', '2011', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'actually', '**']",N/A
1397797,A387BD735MI50R,B004EC5ITI,R. Schultz,"[9, 13]","The first three-quarters of this film are suspenseful and somewhat innovative. ""The Resident"" attempts a sort of Rashomon-like recursion from different points of view.First we see life from Hilary Swank's character's point of view. She's a busy ER Doctor who responds to an ad for an improbably large, inexpensive Victorian apartment unit in New York. From the start, she's a little suspicious of what lies behind the complex, creviced spaces in the old building. She's a little unsettled by the atmosphere of the place and the things that go bump in the night.Then the film figuratively rewinds and we see the same progression of events from the stalker's point of view, from the point of view of the person who is in fact creating those unnerving little rustlings from the rafters, from behind the lathes of the apartment. We see how he originally crossed paths with the Doctor and how he launched his campaign to ""get"" her.It isn't a radically different perspective, but we catch more subtleties of angle and expression the second time around. The stalker, who comes across as being simply so handsome, so charmingly self-effacing in the first reel - expresses a more dangerous intensity in the re-play. We catch the flash of cold appraisal and calculation that crosses his face when Hilary Swank's back is turned. We understand the level of his peeping, peering obsession better.Although this situation is hardly novel in the suspense/thriller genre - these lead actors are so beautifully caressed by the camera, it would be a pleasure to see them in any context, acting out the flimsiest of plots. There are some beautifully sensuous nude scenes included as well.Unfortunately, the last quarter of this film turns into utter clich&eacute;, betraying much of the film's early promise.SPOILER - SPOILERIn that last quarter, the stalker turns predictably ulta-homicidal and the film devolves into a gory, blood-sport combat between stalker and Swank - with Swank displaying her Million Dollar Baby fighter's fitness in the fray. Once, just once, I would have liked the stalker to turn out to be not quite so mad - and for him and the object of his affections to get together and live happily ever after. Now THAT would have been innovative. I almost thought this movie might break new ground in that direction.

Hillary Swank stars as a woman coming out of a bad relationship and seeking a new start, who manages to land a lavish apartment in a luxury building she normally couldn't afford.  Landlord Jeffrey Dean Morgan is rennovating the entire, now practically vacant, building himself, and explains that rentals are so cheap right now because of all the noise and disturbances from the repairs, and Swank jumps at the opportunity.  One of the few other tenants of the building is its third star, Christopher Lee playing Morgan's partially infirm grandfather.It quickly becomes evident that someone is watching and stalking Swank's character, and rather than keep everything under wraps, the movie makes like a whodunit and puts its possibilities out on the table to try to figure out.  It could be Morgan, the landlord with whom Swank seems to share a mutual attraction; it could be Lee, the kindly-seeming but sometimes suspicious-acting old gentleman; it could be an unseen, unmentioned additional tenant inhabiting one of the building's apartments.  To me, the movie does a better job at suspense and atmosphere than other recent 'obsessive stalker' movies like The Roommate, and its overall edge is sharper as it gets darker, a bit weirder and considerably more disturbing as it progresses.  All three main players give high-quality performances, and the characters, despite the familiar set-up, don't come across as stereotyped or at all dull.Though definately a suspense thriller, I'd also classify The Resident as a horror movie, and I think it'll appeal to fans of both camps.  Speaking of its status as a horror movie - it's SO good to have Christopher Lee back in a horror movie, and it's icing on the cake that it happens to be one of the first films out the gate from recently reformed Hammer Studios.  Lee was one of horror's most prolific lead actors from about the late-50s through the mid-70s, with many of his most memorable movies being Hammer productions, then seemed to largely fade from prominence.  Ever since his big career upsurge with the Star Wars prequels and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy I've been waiting to see if he'd do another horror movie, and here he has.

The fact that the storyline seemed straight up my alley was mere icing on the cake.The story opens up with a female surgeon (Hilary Swank) who'd recently separated from her boyfriend seeking a new place to live. Through some chance events, she happens on a gorgeous flat. She immediately (and rightly) thinks she wouldn't be able to afford it, however, the landlord (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) cuts her a deal that seemed too good to be true. As the story unfolds, we learned *why* the deal seemed too good to be true.This is one of those movies that's borderline for me. There were a few creepy elements, but there were elements that left me scratching my head because they seemed misplaced. A few times, the movie grazed greatness, but never quite got there. Given the script and the roles they had to play, I believe Swank and Morgan did a fantastic job, however, their performances weren't enough to save the movie for me.Take the female lead, for instance, makes some stupid decisions that any woman in her right mind wouldn't do, especially when she starts thinking that something's amiss with her new flat.

Morgan is just too lovable, too blindingly charismatic, to play a character we're supposed to fear or hate, although Morgan's performance is almost astonishingly good considering the material.  The second is the script: co-written by the film's ruthlessly unimaginative director, Antti Jokinen (this is his first film), the story was a dead horse two decades ago, and the writers can't even fathom why it might need to be injected with something fresh or original.

This is not really a horror movie so much as a creepy stalker movie, along the lines of ""One Hour Photo"".  The things the stalker does to her is enough to make you cringe.  He doesn't do sadistic things in the strict sense of the word, but sitting and watching her sleep and running his hands barely over her body from an inch away is pretty creepy.  Without trying to say too much, the main aspect of the movie isn't finding out who the stalker is, but watching as she learns who it is and her reaction.  Without Hilary Swank this movie would have been a straight to video disaster.  With her it gives the movie a legitamate feel and deserved a wider realease then it got.

Not only do you have to wonder what strangers are thinking, but you also have to wonder what people you ""know"" are thinking as well. That, along with not trusting apartment management, seems to be a theme in this movie. To watch it and like it, you have to be happy with Hillary Swank, enjoy two sides to Jeffrey Morgan, and distrust what you understand as intuition and those gut feelings that say ""this is wrong.""I guess that rent really looked good.When it came to The Resident, I thought this seemed like two movies trying to start up at once. The first seemed to have a distrust theme playing, with a little bit of naivity thrown in for kicks. Swank tries to come across as a woman who is marred by a bad relationship, seems people stalking her in the flashbeams of every passing figure, and still trusts enough to overlook a lot of things. Unlocked doors, sounds, open windows; all those things are golden.Just as long as you drink a lot - and she does.The second movie is more of a pure stalker film, showing you exactly who and what your problem is. You KNOW who the problem is after a specific event and you are pretty sure that madness is a theme. This happens early - too early - so you have to ride on the knowledge that this will stays terrifying. You see the danger in everything that happens to do with the apratment that Swank rents, too, even though she does not. It is overdone. You have to believe that firehazards are not that bad, that a ER doctor cannot afford rent, and that drinking three glases of wine a night and passing out everyday is not a sign (to a doctor) that she might have a problem. Some things just have to go a bit too far and fall into the unbeliveable.As far as the acting goes, Morgan was great in places. He is charging and yet cruel and he is strange and he is odd. I liked that and i liked the way he was portrayed, making a character that would not be sound somewhat detached and a lot-a-bit mad. I wonder what he would have been like if they let him truly act, trying out this person without the script-lease in tow. Swank is less on that scale, trying too much. Added in is the oddity in the romance and the chemical attraction you have to wonder about, not to mention some badly-timed whimpering. She seems to find a relationship woe as bad as violation on a MASSIVE scale. Worse still, she does not notice someone coming into her home for weeks. No footprints, nothing out-of-place; I would hope this is not a world people truly haunt. And Lee; he's great here and every likeable as the oddly eclectic (and seemingly cruel) father-figure. I liked him here and he helped the movie, although the role was somewhat shallow for someone so good.And then there is the film's plot. I liked the idea even after it switched gears, and I rode along. Still, it got hard to buy and depleted stars fast. I liked it 9hence the 3/5),but that wore down quickly once the suspense balloons ruptured. It basically went from ""who done it"" to ""that's creepy"" in spades, but that got to be one thing trying to be worse than the other when the bad guy acts out some fantasies. And they are creepy but you think you would notice. Swank does not - it takes a bomb for her to truly understand who she oculd be at war with.Does that mean it is horrid? No. I just think you need to want to see it before you should go out and check into it. It has the whole stalker market of movies in it, from Single White Female to The Roommate and a few more.

She finds the perfect place in a building owned by Max (Morgan) and his grandfather August (Christopher Lee)with great square footage, a vintage look and view at a reasonable price. Max and his grandfather are having the building renovated and, as a result, they don't have any other tenants aside from themselves.After settling into the place Devereau feels like she's being watched although she puts it down to exhaustion and an overworked imagination. She finds herself attracted to Max but is uncertain about carrying on a relationship with her landlord and this is complicated by her desire to see her ex again.""The Resident"" has a good set up and a great cast but they aren't given much to do beyond embelishing a paint-by-numbers thriller that is predictable right down to the final showdown between Juliet and her stalker. It's a pity because the cast IS terrific and Swank does a fine job as the strong woman-in-peril. Lee who appeared in a number of classic (and not-so-classic) Hammer films is a nice prescence but not much is done with his character which is too bad because he still has a commanding presence on screen. There are a couple of nice imaginative touches in the film but these are few and fleeting. These imaginative moments aren't enough to save a very routine and disappointing thriller. The moody cinematography of Guillermo Navarro is also one of the saving graces of ""The Resident"".The blu-ray looks quite nice although there are some issues with compression in a couple of scenes although the texture and color (although a little warm) are nicely rendered here. The lossless audio sounds quite nice with nice depth, clear dialogue and nice directional use of the surround format.The special features are limited to a theatrical trailer.
