876465,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00070Q7VE,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[9, 10]","Stu Ungar had one of the most captivating lives in the history of biography, but, unfortunately, this movie does not do it justice.  The motif here is that Ungar gives his memoirs verbally to an imagined mafioso in his hotel room shortly before he dies. Hence the film.The early parts are of the movie are the worst part as it's a Goodfellas rip off with even a replay of the wedding cash train scene that has been super-imposed to Stu's Bar Mitzvah.  The local gangsters are devoid of the style found within Scorcese's classic.  The child actor playing him in the beginning is completely wrong for the part.A major problem that I with High Roller also concerned casting because Michael Imperioli is way too cool to be playing a guy like Ungar.  He can't come off with zero social skills if he tried for a century, but, of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, finding somebody like Stu amidst all the models is not easy to do.  Imperioli's acting was excellent though aside from his physical appearance.One thing that I have to say in the director's defense about this movie is that they tried hard to be authentic with many of the facts.  It was true that Ungar, even though he was worth millions, had his power shut off for not paying his bills.  Also, it was historically accurate that his comment after winning the World Series of the Poker for the second time was that ""he'd probably blow"" the money which is exactly what he said and then did.There is a pseudo-Doyle Brunson composite character who takes on the role of best friend, if Stu could have had one.  He makes a play onscreen in a cash game that I recognized from Super System.  I was impressed that they pulled that out of the book to use here.  It was quite believable that Stu would have been so obsessed that he had to sign his mortgage papers at the poker table.  That kind of attention to detail is why I give High Roller the three stars.",3,"""Life is a People Game Too.""",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,1907,"['Stu', 'Ungar', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'lives', 'history', 'biography', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'motif', 'here', 'Ungar', 'memoirs', 'verbally', 'imagined', 'mafioso', 'hotel', 'room', 'shortly', 'Hence', 'film.The', 'early', 'parts', 'are', 'movie', 'are', 'worst', 'part', 'Goodfellas', 'rip', 'even', 'replay', 'wedding', 'cash', 'train', 'scene', 'been', 'super-imposed', 'Stu', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'local', 'gangsters', 'are', 'devoid', 'style', 'found', 'Scorcese', 'classic', 'child', 'actor', 'playing', 'beginning', 'completely', 'wrong', 'part.A', 'major', 'problem', 'High', 'Roller', 'also', 'concerned', 'casting', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'way', 'too', 'cool', 'be', 'playing', 'guy', 'Ungar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'zero', 'social', 'skills', 'tried', 'century', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'finding', 'somebody', 'Stu', 'amidst', 'models', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'Imperioli', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'aside', 'physical', 'appearance.One', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'director', 'defense', 'movie', 'tried', 'hard', 'be', 'authentic', 'many', 'facts', 'was', 'true', 'Ungar', 'even', 'was', 'worth', 'millions', 'had', 'power', 'shut', 'off', 'not', 'paying', 'bills', 'Also', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'comment', 'winning', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'second', 'time', 'was', ""'d"", 'probably', 'blow', 'money', 'exactly', 'what', 'said', 'then', 'pseudo-Doyle', 'Brunson', 'composite', 'character', 'who', 'role', 'best', 'friend', 'Stu', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'play', 'onscreen', 'cash', 'game', 'recognized', 'Super', 'System', 'was', 'impressed', 'pulled', 'book', 'use', 'here', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'Stu', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'obsessed', 'had', 'sign', 'mortgage', 'papers', 'poker', 'table', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'why', 'give', 'High', 'Roller', 'three', 'stars']",High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story

876469,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00070Q7VE,Larry VanDeSande,"[20, 23]","Fans of HBO's ""The Sopranos"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" will enjoy ""High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story"", a story about the rise and fall of real life gambler Stu Ungar.""Sopranos"" lieutenant Michael Imperioli plays the lead role in this biopic. He is nothing special in the role, which apparently was supposed to portray a much younger man -- one that would be carded in a bar. Imperioli shows affinity for the ultimate loser but also shows his lack of breadth as an actor by playing the same role he plays in ""The Sopranos"". The producers lose some creidibility by never changing his appearance whether its 1978, 1989 or 1996.Alumni from both ""The Sopranos"" and ""Casino"" play significant roles in this flick. One from each plays Imperioli's best buddies. Michael Nouri does some of the best work of his career in a one-dimensional role as mentor to the young Ungar, whose profligate talent as a cardshark appears as a boy of single digit years. Another actor plays the young Stu Ungar, a boy typically at odds with his father. That kid did a better job in the role than Imperioli, in my opinion.But it's the story that's the clincher here, not the acting or players. And that follows young Stu from his earliest days in a household dominated by a strong father figure, to his high life as a Gin Rummy player, to his marriage and fatherhood years in Las Vegas, to his ultimate decline and death at an early age.The story is always interesting and involving. In particular, this story is better crafted than two bigger budget casino flicks of recent years, the ridiculously-plotted ""The Cooler"" and the slick but superficial remake of 1960's ""Ocean's 11"". Neither of those films shows the humanity on display in ""High Roller"", whose basis in real life is obviously its strongest selling point on celluloid.So rent, buy or borrow this movie if you like gambling, casino or human studies on film and settle in for a two-hour view into another life and another world, one far from the planet most of us inhabit.",3,Better than most casino movies,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2009,"['Fans', 'HBO', 'Sopranos', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Casino', 'will', 'enjoy', 'High', 'Roller', 'Stu', 'Ungar', 'Story', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', 'real', 'life', 'gambler', 'Stu', 'Ungar', 'Sopranos', 'lieutenant', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'lead', 'role', 'biopic', 'nothing', 'special', 'role', 'apparently', 'was', 'supposed', 'portray', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'carded', 'bar', 'Imperioli', 'affinity', 'ultimate', 'loser', 'also', 'lack', 'breadth', 'actor', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'Sopranos', 'producers', 'lose', 'creidibility', 'never', 'changing', 'appearance', '1978', '1989', '1996.Alumni', 'Sopranos', 'Casino', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'flick', 'One', 'plays', 'Imperioli', 'best', 'buddies', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'best', 'work', 'career', 'one-dimensional', 'role', 'mentor', 'young', 'Ungar', 'profligate', 'talent', 'cardshark', 'boy', 'single', 'digit', 'years', 'actor', 'young', 'Stu', 'Ungar', 'boy', 'typically', 'odds', 'father', 'kid', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'role', 'Imperioli', 'opinion.But', 'story', 'clincher', 'here', 'not', 'acting', 'players', 'young', 'Stu', 'earliest', 'days', 'household', 'dominated', 'strong', 'father', 'figure', 'high', 'life', 'Gin', 'Rummy', 'player', 'marriage', 'fatherhood', 'years', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'ultimate', 'decline', 'death', 'early', 'age.The', 'story', 'always', 'interesting', 'involving', 'particular', 'story', 'better', 'crafted', 'two', 'bigger', 'budget', 'casino', 'flicks', 'recent', 'years', 'ridiculously-plotted', 'Cooler', 'slick', 'superficial', 'remake', '1960', 'Ocean', '11', 'Neither', 'films', 'humanity', 'display', 'High', 'Roller', 'basis', 'real', 'life', 'obviously', 'strongest', 'selling', 'point', 'celluloid.So', 'rent', 'buy', 'borrow', 'movie', 'like', 'gambling', 'casino', 'human', 'studies', 'film', 'settle', 'two-hour', 'view', 'life', 'world', 'one', 'far', 'planet', 'most', 'inhabit']",High Roller - The Stu Ungar Story

I read mnay things about him on the internet and his lifestory was so interesting that a film about his life would be very interesting as well. Sadly, this movie didn't come close to revealing the passion that was stu. His grief and anguish in this film was but a small glimpse of a real man with more profound emotions than the character who played him. The movie felt like it was on the peripheral rather than really facing the man, Stu U. In short the character didn't do justice to him nor did the script. Stu was a brilliant man but they never showed his intellect the way he deserved. Rather, they portrayed him as a very good Gin player, which he was, with a foul mouth and bad manners. I believe he wasn't as naive and childish as they made him out to be in the movie.
