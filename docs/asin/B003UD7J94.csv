1363780,A10QVHHPD3GY6R,B003UD7J94,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","As a huge fan of the book, I must say that I loved this series!  Like other reviewers have mentioned (some with obvious displeasure), there are some deviations from the book.  However, I don't think that it took away from the television version at all.  There are very few film adaptations of books that are verbatim replicas of their literary counterparts, and many of them are wonderful and successful.  To me, this falls in that category.  Also, Ken Follett actually participated in the writing of the series, so any departures from the book had his hand in them.  Ultimately, none of them changed the overall plot, theme, or outcome of the story, anyway.The series is based in the 12th century (aka The Nineteen-Year Winter) during a period known as the Anarchy where there was a succession battle raging between King Henry I's daughter Matilda (Maude) and his nephew Stephen as Henry's only legitimate son (and heir to the throne) died in a shipwreck.  An unemployed architect named Tom who is traveling with his two children, Alfred and Martha, and his lover, Ellen, and her son, Jack, come across a town called Kingsbridge where the very pious Prior Philip commissions him to rebuild the priory's cathedral.  In order to do so, Tom needs access to a nearby quarry to obtain stone.  Of course, this is easier said than done as the quarry is given to Percy Hamleigh as part of his earldom.  As the balance of power shifts back and forth between Stephen and Maude, so do the rights to the quarry.To complicate matters, enter ""the girl"", the likewise high-born Aliena, who has blown off Percy Hamleigh's son, William.  Percy and William clearly don't like being snubbed, so this brings on a whole mess of vengeful acts that end up involving Aliena's father and his lands.  Similarly, whoever has the upper hand in these disputes changes with whoever is winning the war at the time, Stephen or Maude.  Aliena eventually finds herself in Kingsbridge where she becomes the object of both Alfred and Jack's affection, who already have a rivalry going over Tom's fatherly affections and attentions especially pertaining to who is higher in his eyes as a builder's apprentice.Meanwhile, tensions are rising between Prior Philip and the presiding Bishop Waleran, who has his own motives to prevent the cathedral from being completed.  Waleran's alliances shift from party to party, and he seeks to destroy his ever-growing list of enemies as the story progresses.  He also doesn't hesitate to use his connections with the Church to pull strings as this was centuries before England had broken away from Catholicism and thus still answered to Rome.  Further complications arise when it is discovered that Tom and Ellen are living as husband and wife though they are not actually married.  Ellen, who is a self-proclaimed free spirit who lived with Jack alone in the woods before meeting Tom, is quickly accused of witchcraft which obviously doesn't go over well with the monks.The series is politically smart drawing heavily on common law principles and class hierarchy of the English Middle Ages.  There is a definite distinction between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in the book; however, there are disputes even within the members of each of these two groups that make it difficult for each of them to advance their own causes.  The characters are very well-developed.  If they're one of the good guys, you're rooting for them the whole time; but if they're one of the rotten apples, you hate them with a passion... and with very good reason.The set and cinematography is impressive as well.  The series takes place primarily in castles, medieval towns, and around cathedrals, and it looks like no detail was spared.The casting was pretty stellar as well.  Worth noting: Matthew Macfadyen as Prior Philip, David Oakes as William Hamleigh, and Ian McShane as Bishop Waleran Bigod.  Honestly, Ian McShane stole the show.  He absolutely rocked.  An actor who can make you hate his character that much has some serious talent.  His portrayal was exactly how I imagined Waleran in the book.A sidenote: if you like this series and the book, check out Ken Follett's semi-sequel, ""World Without End"".  It's based in Kingsbridge several centuries later.

1363782,AB4F6UHL20U95,B003UD7J94,Anne Rice,"[1, 2]","We are in a new golden age of television today, a time rich in historical, science fiction, speculative and fantasy drama.  And this series, Pillars of the Earth, is a perfect example of the fine fare being offered to us now regularly. Right up there in production values with The Tudors,  this is a fast paced and suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining drama. It is leagues beyond the older slow moving and often poorly conceived historical dramas of yesterday's television.  Beautifully written by John Pielmeier, and lavishly filmed with excellent cinematography and art direction, this series carries one back to the great age of cathedral building --- inviting us to surrender to  a brutal yet fascinating world where good fights against evil in spite of endless defeat.  Matthew MacFadyen is superb in this, as is Rufus Sewell, Donald Sutherland and Ian MaShane and just about every other member of the large cast.  This is dark, yet always fun, and the glimpse we get into the making of cathedrals is tantalizing and enthralling.  Highly  recommended.  If you've given up on historical series in the past because of the poor quality, by all means give this a try.  As I said above, we are in a new golden age of television now.

1363787,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003UD7J94,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[19, 23]","In the 12th Century, the English throne is being contested by two claimants. Queen Maud, the eldest child and daughter of the late king and named as his successor, and King Stephen, the king's nephew who has the backing of the Church and much of the nobility. As the civil war known as the Anarchy rages, other noble families take advantage of the chaos to their own ends, as the Hamleighs seize control of Shiring Castle after denouncing its lord to Stephen as a traitor. The lord's heirs, Aliena and Richard, vow to regain their birthright.Meanwhile, Tom Builder, a stonemason left jobless by the war, joins forces with the ambitious Prior Philip of Kingsbridge to erect a massive cathedral, in doing so making an enemy of Bishop Waleran, whose ambitions will not allow the edifice to be constructed...Pillars of the Earth is an eight-part TV miniseries, based on Ken Follett's novel of the same name. At its heart it chronicles the building of a cathedral in the (fictitious) village of Kingsbridge against both religious and secular opposition, around which swirls a number of real and fictional historical events relating to a bloody civil war and dynastic struggles for power. It has a notable cast featuring established actors such as Donald Sutherland, Rufus Sewell, Ian McShane, Matthew Macfadyn, Robert Bathurst and Sarah Parish, and relative newcomers like Hayley Atwell and Eddie Redmayne (who, if he was a few years younger, would have made a great Rand al'Thor if the Wheel of Time movie had ever gotten off the ground). It also has a reasonable budget (coming in at $5 million per episode) and excellent production values, with some great CGI and some nice Eastern European location shooting (albeit the fact that none of the locations look remotely like their actual English counterparts, but what the heck).Is the series a success? Yes and no. If you've read the book you'll know what you are in for: lots of cheesy melodrama, a lack of historical accuracy, a dearth of character depth and some truly inane dialogue. At the same time, there's something fundamentally likable about this derivative story and its corny characters. The actors give enthusiastic performances (though Ian McShane is clearly lamenting the lack of the more nuanced scripts he had to work with on Deadwood and in some scenes is on autopilot) and, most importantly, the scriptwriter has squeezed the thousand-page story into eight episodes, which keeps it rocketing along like a greyhound on crack. Spinning it out to ten or twelve episodes would have resulted in longueurs packed with filler which the book suffers from in some sections. As it stands, the television adaptation doesn't really stand still long enough for the viewer to fully process its flaws (although there'll still be audible groans when William Hamleigh turns up to burn down Kingsbridge for what feels like the fortieth time).Those flaws are legion but don't really seem to detract from the watchability of the series (although this may also be attributable to how terrible almost everything else is on TV these days). This is tosh of the highest order, then, but highly watchable tosh which does not require much exercising of the old grey matter.The Pillars of the Earth (***) is available now on DVD in the UK and USA.",3,Watchable tosh,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,3284,"['12th', 'Century', 'English', 'throne', 'being', 'contested', 'two', 'claimants', 'Queen', 'Maud', 'eldest', 'child', 'daughter', 'late', 'king', 'named', 'successor', 'King', 'Stephen', 'king', 'nephew', 'who', 'backing', 'Church', 'much', 'nobility', 'civil', 'war', 'known', 'Anarchy', 'rages', 'other', 'noble', 'families', 'take', 'advantage', 'chaos', 'own', 'ends', 'Hamleighs', 'seize', 'control', 'Shiring', 'Castle', 'denouncing', 'lord', 'Stephen', 'traitor', 'lord', 'heirs', 'Aliena', 'Richard', 'vow', 'regain', 'birthright.Meanwhile', 'Tom', 'Builder', 'stonemason', 'left', 'jobless', 'war', 'forces', 'ambitious', 'Prior', 'Philip', 'Kingsbridge', 'erect', 'massive', 'cathedral', 'doing', 'so', 'making', 'enemy', 'Bishop', 'Waleran', 'ambitions', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'edifice', 'be', 'constructed', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'eight-part', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'heart', 'building', 'cathedral', 'fictitious', 'village', 'Kingsbridge', 'religious', 'secular', 'opposition', 'number', 'real', 'fictional', 'historical', 'events', 'relating', 'bloody', 'civil', 'war', 'dynastic', 'struggles', 'power', 'notable', 'cast', 'featuring', 'established', 'actors', 'such', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyn', 'Robert', 'Bathurst', 'Sarah', 'Parish', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'who', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'younger', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'Rand', ""al'Thor"", 'Wheel', 'Time', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'gotten', 'off', 'ground', 'also', 'reasonable', 'budget', 'coming', '5', 'million', 'episode', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'CGI', 'nice', 'Eastern', 'European', 'location', 'shooting', 'fact', 'none', 'locations', 'look', 'remotely', 'actual', 'English', 'counterparts', 'what', 'heck', 'series', 'success', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'lots', 'cheesy', 'melodrama', 'lack', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'dearth', 'character', 'depth', 'truly', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'fundamentally', 'likable', 'derivative', 'story', 'corny', 'characters', 'actors', 'give', 'enthusiastic', 'performances', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'clearly', 'lamenting', 'lack', 'more', 'nuanced', 'scripts', 'had', 'work', 'Deadwood', 'scenes', 'autopilot', 'most', 'importantly', 'scriptwriter', 'squeezed', 'thousand-page', 'story', 'eight', 'episodes', 'rocketing', 'greyhound', 'crack', 'Spinning', 'ten', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'longueurs', 'packed', 'filler', 'book', 'suffers', 'sections', 'television', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'still', 'long', 'enough', 'viewer', 'fully', 'process', 'flaws', 'there', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'audible', 'groans', 'when', 'William', 'Hamleigh', 'up', 'burn', 'down', 'Kingsbridge', 'what', 'feels', 'fortieth', 'time', '.Those', 'flaws', 'are', 'legion', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'detract', 'watchability', 'series', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'attributable', 'how', 'terrible', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', 'TV', 'days', 'tosh', 'highest', 'order', 'then', 'highly', 'watchable', 'tosh', 'not', 'require', 'much', 'exercising', 'old', 'grey', 'matter.The', 'Pillars', 'Earth', '***', 'available', 'now', 'DVD', 'UK', 'USA']",N/A

1363797,AB34G6VKP28L,B003UD7J94,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[5, 5]","Inspired by and based on a bestselling novel by Ken Follett, The Pillars of the Earth is a sprawling epic that takes place during the turbulent English reign of King Stephen...When a ship goes down crossing the English channel bearing the future heir to the throne, King Henry I is forced to contend with the possibility that his throne may go to his daughter, Maud (Alison Pill), and her descendants. Little does he know that his nephew, Stephen (Tony Curran), has ambitions toward becoming ruler -- at any cost, and together with the evil Bishop Waleran (Ian McShane), strives to make his deepest desire a reality. The monarch meets his end the same night that his daughter bears England an heir, leaving Stephen to crown himself king and set off a bloody civil war. Maude has on her side one of the foremost nobleman at court (Donald Sutherland), but when he is found out and rumors of his intent to assist Maude in reclaiming the throne reach the ear of Stephen, retribution spills out into the night -- leaving many casualties. His children, Richard (Sam Claflin) and Aliena (Hayley Atwell), manage to escape, but not for long... and she is particularly sought after by a ruthless knight, William (David Oakes), who has other intentions than making her his wife...Meanwhile, a stonemason named Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell) takes refuge in the cave of an outcast, Ellen (Natalia W&ouml;rner), along with his heavily pregnant wife and their two children. But his wife, suspicious of their surroundings and certain that Ellen is a witch, insists on going once more out into the winter cold -- resulting in her death and his decision to leave the newly born child on her grave to die. But when he returns for it, the child is missing. Ellen and her son Jack (Eddie Redmayne) accompany Tom and his family into the local parish, to look for work, but the church, although in disrepair, cannot afford to pay to have the structure rebuilt. But when fire rages through what remains of the church and destroys their holy relics, Prior Philip () not only faces a pang of conscience in whether or not to replace the relics with counterfeits but also a tremendous burden in building a structure that soon will become the bane of Waleran's existence and bring about much strife, discourse, and rivalry over the next twenty years.Although fairly wide in its scope and epic in the sense that it has an enormous character base (more than a dozen main characters turn up in the course of the story), there is something lacking in this miniseries. In some respects it remains faithful to the novel and in others it strays significantly, right to altering characters' personalities, bringing in incestuous elements, and changing major plot arcs in the last two hours. The cast is magnificent but the characters do not give off much of a sense of depth and the writer doesn't know what to do with his villains -- they are sufficiently evil but one questions his own actions so much that he fails to be as frightening as he should be; the other is manipulative but hardly emotionally intimidating. Many of the characters are simply not that likable, the boldest exception being Prior Philip -- in part due to Matthew Macfayden's sensitive depiction of a naive man left to contend with political upheaval. In some instances the storyline feels forced, but then perhaps I was thrown off a bit by the content. The middle ages were not pleasant and the story does not shy away from that, sometimes showing us its horrors in great detail. On the up side, it does have an incredible score and beautiful photography, and the final hour is particularly gripping and solid in terms of storytelling.Some of the historical events in this series are inaccurate, but it does interest one in the time period and the events of the age. I found certain plot twists very solid and enjoyable and others seemed contrived. But I will say it would have been altogether more enjoyable without the gratuitous emphasis on rape, incest, and vulgarity.",3,"great story, lurid presentation",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,4007,"['Inspired', 'based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'sprawling', 'epic', 'place', 'turbulent', 'English', 'reign', 'King', 'Stephen', 'When', 'ship', 'down', 'crossing', 'English', 'channel', 'bearing', 'future', 'heir', 'throne', 'King', 'Henry', 'forced', 'contend', 'possibility', 'throne', 'may', 'go', 'daughter', 'Maud', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'descendants', 'Little', 'know', 'nephew', 'Stephen', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'ambitions', 'becoming', 'ruler', 'cost', 'together', 'evil', 'Bishop', 'Waleran', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'make', 'deepest', 'desire', 'reality', 'monarch', 'end', 'same', 'night', 'daughter', 'bears', 'England', 'heir', 'leaving', 'Stephen', 'crown', 'king', 'set', 'off', 'bloody', 'civil', 'war', 'Maude', 'side', 'one', 'foremost', 'nobleman', 'court', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'when', 'found', 'rumors', 'intent', 'assist', 'Maude', 'reclaiming', 'throne', 'reach', 'ear', 'Stephen', 'retribution', 'out', 'night', 'leaving', 'many', 'casualties', 'children', 'Richard', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'Aliena', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'manage', 'escape', 'not', 'long', 'particularly', 'sought', 'ruthless', 'knight', 'William', 'David', 'Oakes', 'who', 'other', 'intentions', 'making', 'wife', 'Meanwhile', 'stonemason', 'named', 'Tom', 'Builder', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'refuge', 'cave', 'outcast', 'Ellen', 'Natalia', 'W', 'ouml', 'rner', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'wife', 'suspicious', 'surroundings', 'certain', 'Ellen', 'witch', 'going', 'once', 'more', 'out', 'winter', 'cold', 'resulting', 'death', 'decision', 'leave', 'newly', 'born', 'child', 'grave', 'die', 'when', 'child', 'missing', 'Ellen', 'son', 'Jack', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'accompany', 'Tom', 'family', 'local', 'parish', 'look', 'work', 'church', 'disrepair', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'pay', 'have', 'structure', 'rebuilt', 'when', 'fire', 'what', 'church', 'destroys', 'holy', 'relics', 'Prior', 'Philip', 'not', 'only', 'pang', 'conscience', 'not', 'replace', 'relics', 'counterfeits', 'also', 'tremendous', 'burden', 'building', 'structure', 'soon', 'will', 'become', 'bane', 'Waleran', 'existence', 'bring', 'about', 'much', 'strife', 'discourse', 'rivalry', 'next', 'twenty', 'fairly', 'wide', 'scope', 'epic', 'sense', 'enormous', 'character', 'base', 'more', 'dozen', 'main', 'characters', 'turn', 'up', 'course', 'story', 'something', 'lacking', 'miniseries', 'respects', 'faithful', 'novel', 'others', 'significantly', 'right', 'altering', 'characters', 'personalities', 'bringing', 'incestuous', 'elements', 'changing', 'major', 'plot', 'arcs', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'cast', 'magnificent', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'off', 'much', 'sense', 'depth', 'writer', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'villains', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'evil', 'one', 'questions', 'own', 'actions', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'as', 'frightening', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'manipulative', 'hardly', 'emotionally', 'intimidating', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'likable', 'boldest', 'exception', 'being', 'Prior', 'Philip', 'part', 'due', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'sensitive', 'depiction', 'naive', 'man', 'left', 'contend', 'political', 'upheaval', 'instances', 'storyline', 'feels', 'forced', 'then', 'perhaps', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'bit', 'content', 'middle', 'ages', 'were', 'not', 'pleasant', 'story', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'sometimes', 'showing', 'horrors', 'great', 'detail', 'up', 'side', 'have', 'incredible', 'score', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'final', 'hour', 'particularly', 'gripping', 'solid', 'terms', 'storytelling.Some', 'historical', 'events', 'series', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'interest', 'one', 'time', 'period', 'events', 'age', 'found', 'certain', 'plot', 'twists', 'very', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'others', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'will', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'altogether', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'gratuitous', 'emphasis', 'rape', 'incest', 'vulgarity']",N/A

It's worth it, IMO.  It has great image quality and sound.My wife had read the book, and then saw that a movie channel was running it (divided into 9 episodes).  After watching the first two episodes, she ordered the Blu-Ray set.  It got here quickly (Amazon's regular shipping), so we saw it before the movie channel had finished their nightly telecasts of the series.  Both of us really enjoyed the DVDs.  A lot.When we watch a movie based on a book, we rate the movie on its production, the acting, how engrossed we get in it, and how much we enjoy it, rather than how it compares to the book.  I give this movie 5 stars.  My wife gives the book 5 stars, and also gives 5 stars to the movie.The acting is first rate, the cinematography is outstanding, and the plot holds one's attention for the entire seven hours.That movie channel had me a little confused at first - they were televising 9 episodes, not 8.  Was there a sequel that I couldn't learn anything about?  The answer is NO, I think.  It appears that channel put all eight episodes together, then divided it into 9 episodes.  That way they could fit in more commercials.  That's just a guess on my part, though.Even with them making 9 episodes, the TV version lacks some of the scenes that are on the DVDs.Bottom line:  we're very glad we bought the DVDs, especially the Blu-Ray version.",5,The Blu-Ray version is worth the few extra $$,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,1498,"['review', 'will', 'cover', 'different', 'aspects', ""'ll"", 'comment', 'Blu-Ray', 'first', 'today', 'Blu-Ray', '4.50', 'more', 'regular', 'DVD', 'IMO', 'great', 'image', 'quality', 'sound.My', 'wife', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'saw', 'movie', 'channel', 'was', 'running', 'divided', '9', 'episodes', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'ordered', 'Blu-Ray', 'set', 'got', 'here', 'quickly', 'Amazon', 'regular', 'shipping', 'saw', 'movie', 'channel', 'had', 'finished', 'nightly', 'telecasts', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DVDs', 'lot.When', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'rate', 'movie', 'production', 'acting', 'how', 'engrossed', 'get', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'rather', 'how', 'book', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'wife', 'book', '5', 'stars', 'also', '5', 'stars', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'plot', 'one', 'attention', 'entire', 'seven', 'hours.That', 'movie', 'channel', 'had', 'little', 'confused', 'first', 'were', 'televising', '9', 'episodes', 'not', '8', 'Was', 'sequel', 'could', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'answer', 'NO', 'think', 'channel', 'put', 'eight', 'episodes', 'together', 'then', 'divided', '9', 'episodes', 'way', 'could', 'fit', 'more', 'commercials', 'just', 'guess', 'part', 'though.Even', 'making', '9', 'episodes', 'TV', 'version', 'scenes', 'are', 'DVDs.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'especially', 'Blu-Ray', 'version']",N/A

Further having not read the book, I found the story rather hard to follow--with characters seeming to come and go illogically.The acting by all at times, to me, was laughable.  I've admired Rufus Sewell and Mathew Mcfadyen in other presentations (e.g., ""A man of no importance"" ""The way we live now); however, in ""Pillars"" I found Sewell as Tom to be just too good and noble boarding on the sappy and Mcfadyen as Prior Phillip so holy and good that his performance, to me, boardered on the sappy plus he seemed unable to decide if the Prior  (his character) had an accent or not--his accent, of some sort, varied from scene to scene.  The very evil and self-flagellating Bishop Waleran as performed by Ian McShane was, to me, just too melodramatically evil--my god, he's nasty.In conclusion, I am just afraid that I wasted my money in the purchase of this miniseries--you win some and you lose some.",2,A Medieval Soap Opera,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1306,"['many', 'board', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'miniseries', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'found', 'presentation', 'be', 'wrought', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'much', 'chopping', 'heads', 'much', 'yelling', 'individual', 'doing', 'chopping', 'throat', 'slitting', 'again', 'much', 'yelling', 'individual', 'did', 'slitting', 'generally', 'loads', 'maiming', 'folks', 'loads', 'violent', 'sex', 'acts', 'Further', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'found', 'story', 'rather', 'hard', 'follow', 'characters', 'seeming', 'come', 'go', 'illogically.The', 'acting', 'times', 'was', 'laughable', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Mathew', 'Mcfadyen', 'other', 'presentations', 'e.g.', 'man', 'importance', 'way', 'live', 'now', 'however', 'Pillars', 'found', 'Sewell', 'Tom', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'noble', 'boarding', 'sappy', 'Mcfadyen', 'Prior', 'Phillip', 'holy', 'good', 'performance', 'boardered', 'sappy', 'seemed', 'unable', 'decide', 'Prior', 'character', 'had', 'accent', 'not', 'accent', 'sort', 'varied', 'scene', 'scene', 'very', 'evil', 'self-flagellating', 'Bishop', 'Waleran', 'performed', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'melodramatically', 'evil', 'god', 'nasty.In', 'conclusion', 'am', 'just', 'wasted', 'money', 'purchase', 'miniseries', 'win', 'lose']",N/A

1363816,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003UD7J94,Grady Harp,"[103, 111]","PILLARS OF THE EARTH is an ambitious cinematic adaptation of Ken Follett's novel by the same name.  This first season is to be eight episodes, with a 'Season 2' already suggested. The overall message of this historical novel can be summarized as follows: this is a story 'about the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It is set in the middle of the twelfth century, primarily during the time sometimes called the Anarchy, between the time of the sinking of the White Ship and the murder of Thomas Becket. The story traces the development of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque architecture and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory against the backdrop of actual historical events of the time. Although Kingsbridge is the name of an actual English town, the Kingsbridge in the novel is actually a fictional location representative of a typical market town of the time'.Shot on location in Hungary with director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan, director of photography Attila Szalay, and set to the fine musical scoring by Trevor Morris, PILLARS OF THE EARTH is off to a fine start in the first three episodes.  While the series is based on historic facts, there are so many sidebars of added information that it is a bit difficult to keep the flow of the story straight.  Prior Philip (Matthew Macfadyen) yearns to build a cathedral in Kingsbridge, much to the chagrin of the evil Waleran (Ian McShane).  Philip's innate kindness and focus of his mission leads him to Tom Builder (Rufus Sewell) whose wife has died in childbirth and the newborn is left by Tom on his mother's grave only to be saved by a quiet monk.  Tom encounters Ellen (Natalia W&ouml;rner) and her mute son Jack (Eddie Redmayne) who join forces to not only build Prior Philip's cathedral but fight against the forces of royalty who  would alter life in general for all of them.  The fine cast includes Donald Sutherland (early on beheaded), Hayley Atwell, Allison Pill, Gordon Pinset, David Oakes, Sam Claflin, Skye Bennett and many others.  The costumes and sets are realistic and portray the period well.  There is a lot of the now requisite bloodshed and some rather gory scenes, but those go along with the accurate reenactment of the period.  Definitely worth watching.

The casting is excellent, with the exception of Donald Sutherland as the Earl of Shiring. Mr. Sutherland is a good actor, but his American accent detracts somewhat from the story. Fortunately, his role is minor. In a well-rounded cast of British and Irish actors, the producers should have gone with someone with a British or Irish accent, in my opinion. Ian McShane (who I first saw as the villainous Blackbeard in Pirates Of The Carribbean: On Stranger Tides) is deliciously malevolent as the vile Bishop Waleran. Hayley Atwell, Eddie Ramayne, Tony Curran, David Oakes (who recently completed his role as the equally lecherous Juan Borgia on Showtime's The Borgias) & Sam Claflin are also spot-on on their roles. The story is somewhat difficult to follow, as the political machinations are plenty.My only complaint is that the series has been inexplicably edited for nudity. It first aired on Encore, if I'm not mistaken, which is a cable channel (and they allow graphic violence, strong language & sexuality/nudity). There IS some sexuality/nudity, but not as much as I expected. I found out that there is more nudity in the DVD version. Why is that?

Nephew Stephen wins throne. Daughter Maud & son have followers. Tom Builder looks for masonry work and crosses paths with Ellen and her son, Jack.2 MASTER BUILDER- Kingsbridge church burns and there are political deals aplenty. Ellen is accused as witch, & possible holder of a great secret. William gets motherly incest as well as rape added to his achievements. Maud is off to safer France. Tom begins a cathedral.3 REDEMPTION- Tom and William battle over quarry stone. Richard and Aliena seek mercy from father's hanging, and make a deal, a costly one.4 BATTLEFIELD- William and a mystery knight battle for the Shiring Earldom. Stephen and Maud have armies that battle too. Philip looses a battle with Waleran's torturers.5 LEGACY- Gloucester and Stephen both offered for a prisoner exchange. Then Maud and Stephen continue warring. A Kingsbridge festival is terrorized. Jack and Alfred battle over a girl and Tom must sent one packing.6 WICHCRAFT- Maud's back in France and Stephen reigns on. Richard has a Kingsbridge return. Alfred pops the question, marriage and builder style. A HUGE building tragedy, again. Jack's seeking his French family, and work.7 NEW BEGINNINGS- Jack studies geometry & stone building near Paris, a new Gothic style. Aliena treks to France too.

1363822,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,B003UD7J94,H. Schneider,"[13, 25]","This is an apparently successful TV miniseries after a successful fat novel of the historical fiction genre. I have not read the book, but my wife tells me she liked it a lot, and apparently so did many others. I am not much into `historical' novels, so I am not likely to close this special gap in my education. I watched this TV miniseries with her, as she was keen on it. I felt entertained for a while, but then more and more let down by a kind of imbalance in the pace of the screen narration. The story rushes through the years and decades, but the protagonists seem to stay the same. Aging does not seem to have much impact on people in England in the 12th century.The TV production is a multicultural thing. Somehow the Scott brothers are behind it. Apart from that it is a Canadian/ German cooperation with plenty of international labor: a cast from the UK, Canada, and Germany and wherever else. Many Hungarians involved on the production side, plus many other SE Europeans.The subject of the epic is a cathedral that is built under tumultuous conditions and with shaky construction know how in a central English priory. Historical background is a succession war after a legitimate crown prince is murdered by ambitious courtiers and clergy who have made a pact with a usurper. This period is known as the 'Anarchy' and was in fact a civil war between followers of rival pretenders. After Henry I has died, his daughter Maud assumes the throne to keep it in the direct line for her baby son, who will become Henry II, about 2 decades later. In the meantime her cousin Stephen pushes her out and gets pushed out himself, with some Macbethian hocuspocus.Apart from the succession dispute there is much building dispute. We follow its progress or stagnation over decades. Some knowhow gets stolen in France. The final cathedral is remarkably different from the initial church structure, which makes me grumble a bit about the visuals of the long thing. Have they forgotten at the end what the building looked like in the beginning? All in all there is quite a lot of sloppiness in the cinematography here.A third running theme is church intrigue. McShane is the bad priest/bishop/cardinal, who nearly makes it to Archbishop of Canterbury. McFadyen is the good, efficient, intellectual, honest prior who makes promotion and gets demoted and repromoted.The film mixes plenty of stark images of a sexual & violent nature into the story. Sometimes one wonders if there is a good reason for it other than selling considerations.The film seems to have been an international success, so it must have worked, but I find it often rather cheap in its imagery and also in its language, which is often opportunistically and anachronistically contemporary.But then, quality is not something that is decided by vote. I would say, this oeuvre is of negligible value in most respects.",2,A lengthy rush through the Anarchy,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2875,"['apparently', 'successful', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'successful', 'fat', 'novel', 'historical', 'fiction', 'genre', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'wife', 'tells', 'liked', 'lot', 'apparently', 'so', 'did', 'many', 'others', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'historical', 'novels', 'am', 'not', 'likely', 'close', 'special', 'gap', 'education', 'watched', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'was', 'keen', 'felt', 'entertained', 'while', 'then', 'more', 'more', 'let', 'down', 'kind', 'imbalance', 'pace', 'screen', 'narration', 'story', 'years', 'decades', 'protagonists', 'seem', 'stay', 'same', 'Aging', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'people', 'England', '12th', 'century.The', 'TV', 'production', 'multicultural', 'thing', 'Somehow', 'Scott', 'brothers', 'are', 'Apart', 'Canadian/', 'German', 'cooperation', 'plenty', 'international', 'labor', 'cast', 'UK', 'Canada', 'Germany', 'wherever', 'else', 'Many', 'Hungarians', 'involved', 'production', 'side', 'many', 'other', 'SE', 'Europeans.The', 'subject', 'epic', 'cathedral', 'built', 'tumultuous', 'conditions', 'shaky', 'construction', 'know', 'how', 'central', 'English', 'priory', 'Historical', 'background', 'succession', 'war', 'legitimate', 'crown', 'prince', 'murdered', 'ambitious', 'courtiers', 'clergy', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'pact', 'usurper', 'period', 'known', ""'Anarchy"", 'was', 'fact', 'civil', 'war', 'followers', 'rival', 'pretenders', 'Henry', 'died', 'daughter', 'Maud', 'throne', 'keep', 'direct', 'line', 'baby', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'Henry', 'II', 'about', '2', 'decades', 'later', 'meantime', 'cousin', 'Stephen', 'out', 'pushed', 'out', 'Macbethian', 'hocuspocus.Apart', 'succession', 'dispute', 'much', 'building', 'dispute', 'follow', 'progress', 'stagnation', 'decades', 'knowhow', 'stolen', 'France', 'final', 'cathedral', 'remarkably', 'different', 'initial', 'church', 'structure', 'grumble', 'bit', 'visuals', 'long', 'thing', 'Have', 'forgotten', 'end', 'what', 'building', 'looked', 'beginning', 'quite', 'lot', 'sloppiness', 'cinematography', 'here.A', 'third', 'running', 'theme', 'church', 'intrigue', 'McShane', 'bad', 'priest/bishop/cardinal', 'who', 'nearly', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'McFadyen', 'good', 'efficient', 'intellectual', 'honest', 'prior', 'who', 'promotion', 'demoted', 'repromoted.The', 'film', 'mixes', 'plenty', 'stark', 'images', 'sexual', 'violent', 'nature', 'story', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'wonders', 'good', 'reason', 'other', 'selling', 'considerations.The', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'international', 'success', 'must', 'have', 'worked', 'find', 'often', 'rather', 'cheap', 'imagery', 'also', 'language', 'often', 'opportunistically', 'anachronistically', 'contemporary.But', 'then', 'quality', 'not', 'something', 'decided', 'vote', 'would', 'say', 'oeuvre', 'negligible', 'value', 'most', 'respects']",N/A

1363824,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003UD7J94,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","This miniseries is fascinating for many reasons, and first of all because it reveals an English historical period that has not been covered by Shakespeare's Histories, the reign of King Stephen, between King Henry I and King Henry II.This fight between the daughter of Henry I, Matilda in history books, Maud in the film, and the grand son of William the Conqueror and uncle of Matilda who was direct in line, after the accidental death of her elder brother and his wife who should have been king, but she was too young. That's where and when a bishop, Stephen the heiress's uncle and a few barons plot to change the course of history.This is a story of evil plotting and bloody consequences, a long civil war that caused the death of many innocent people. The series shows all the means they had in those days to kill who they wanted without any risk. Of course the barons and other noble people could kill in a regular fight or battle other people of the same rank and their soldiers. But they could kill simple people rather easily and without any risk of ending in court, except if that ending was useful to some other barons or church dignitary. That plotting is marvelously shown in the series.The historical compromise Matilda and Stephen reached in the end is clearly stated but maybe not emphasized enough as an event that will justify all kinds of abuse of power by Henry II, son of Matilda who succeeds Stephen after his death since this Stephen does not have a heir, his son having been killed in battle. This compromise first established the possibility to get on the throne via a female blood line which is typical of the English monarchy in those days and second re-establishes the direct filiation to William the Conqueror, Stephen being only a lateral and unjustified line.The next important element in this series is the way monastic life can become a refuge against the vicissitudes of life, a fragile refuge though that can be disrupted in many ways, by a bishop, a cardinal, the king even, some plotting baron or just some killing baron who takes pleasure in destroying the peace of a religious community. Most of the time these barons need the support, declared or kept secret, of a higher ranking ecclesiastical authority. Sorcery was a good way to disrupt the peace of any community and get rid in the most horrible and barbarous way of some people who could cause a problem to those in power, legitimate or not. Here again the series gives us quite a few episodes of that type.The next question of interest was the real struggle around fairs and markets that brought a good income to the hosting community but was based on guaranteed security all over Europe. That's a good subject, dealt with frankly and directly and showing how that security was very fragile in a way when you had civil strife around. Most of these fairs and markets came from a privilege granted by the king. Here the series is a little bit deficient because the peace of these European markets was seriously guaranteed, the merchants protected, their goods and money protected too. It is always possible to imagine a raid against such a fair or market but that sounds a little bit extreme. These fairs and markets were protected by European regulations. But that's a good story.The last and best story is that about the building of a cathedral in the nascent gothic style and the difficulties it encounters as the nave and vault go always higher and need reinforcement against the wind. The series actually centered on a master builder, in fact two generations of master builders and how they were functioning at the time. The intertwining of this aspect with the other levels of the story makes the building of the cathedral a real adventure in itself and the invention of the flying buttresses to prevent the crumbling of the vault under the pressure of the wind becomes a real stake of the whole plot.A series that is worth watching maybe over and over again just for pleasure and then as an opening vestibule to more research about Henry I, Henry II, Stephen of course, and that should lead us to Thomas Becket under Henry I and the Magna Carta slightly later that was prepared by such constant plotting that was disrespectful of the famous Peace of God that was instated in the eleventh century after a vast and deep popular movement supported and headed by the church itself and several bishops or archbishops. England was slow to get these things and that made the Magna Carta possible, the first document ever in our world in which some categories of people are granted some fundamental rights (orphans and widows mostly) though that is going against feudalism since the divine authority of the king was questioned by barons and church dignitaries.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Good suspense in a time when death

The Pillars of the Earth is my husband's favorite Follett book, and my favorite is World Without End.  So, when we heard that Showtime was releasing The Pillars of the Earth in a mini-series, we knew we had to see it immediately.The mini-series is eight episodes, each about an hour long.  The  writers and producers did a great job bringing the book to life, although there was a lot more sex in the TV version than in the book.  I guess the producers felt like the book needed some spicing up.  I can do without all of that, but we were able to look past it and enjoy the rest of the show.The casting was perfect, with the exception of Tom Builder.  I wanted him to be bigger, taller and broader.  I always pictured him as a really big guy while reading the book.  Alfred could have been a little less petulant, but overall the actor playing Alfred did a good job.  One thing that I had some trouble with was the character playing Prior Phillip (Matthew Macfadyen).  He plays Mr. Darcy in my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  I had a hard time accepting him as Prior Phillip because he will always be Mr. Darcy to me.The plot was slightly modified from the book, but I expected this.  The book is nearly 1000 pages long and there's no way the writers could have stayed 100% true to the plot without making the mini-series at least 20 hours long.If you have not read the book or watched the series, I highly recommend either of them.

Throw in great settings, props, and costumes, base it on a blockbuster of a book, and you've got a winner. Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth is chock full of good guys and villains, and within just a few chapters, the reader definitely knows the difference. And so it is in this mini-series, which has captured the essence of this epic story, a rare enough occurrence to make this production remarkable. Rufus Sewell kicks things off in the role of Tom Builder, who lands a much needed job as master builder at Kingsbridge. Years later, Jack Jackson (portrayed by Eddie Redmayne), son of the local ""witch"" (Natalia Woerner), takes over the project, which is overseen by prior at the monastery, Philip (Matthew Macfadyen). The Earl of Shireton has been deposed, and his daughter Aliana (Hayley Atwell) is determined to recover the title and estate for her younger brother; she manages to set up business as a wool dealer, to support their efforts. All of the above of are thwarted time and again by a powerful team of adversaries. Ian McShane is spot on as the corrupt bishop who brings all his machinations to bear in order to prevent the 12th century village of Kingsbridge from financing and building a great cathedral. Among his equally evil cohorts are William Hamleigh (David Oakes), the usurper of the local earldom, his conniving mother Regan (Sarah Parish), the usurper of the English throne, King Stephen (Tony Curran), and the brooding, resentful Alfred (Liam Garrigan). The entire saga takes place during the tumultuous years when Stephen and Maud were contesting the throne of England.The actors all brought skill and nuance to their roles. It's not easy to choose a standout, but I felt that Sewell, Redmayne, Atwell, and McShane deserve the honors; that is not to belittle the performances of the others. Shot primarily in Austria and Hungary, the production values are solid, and remarkably, the title sequence is a precis of the entire plot.

My biggest critique was the story seemed to run out of gusto and budget at the end. Some of the characters didn't age sequentially to each other and the wig poor Matthew Macfadyen had to wear at the end was just awful! If you freeze frame at the end there is one part where you can see his hair under the bad rug. All in all not a bad film, I am not sure who to blame for the low quality ending. The director, the lack of budget or if the series was low in popularity and stars cut their budget. The overall history of the time period is very interesting to me and the majority of the events were based on fact though some of their depictions I found humorous for the unintended purpose.

And I don't know enough about English medieval history to comment with any authority about the ""accuracy"" of this historical fiction (but honestly, how could one really expect complete accuracy in historical FICTION?).But since this series probably wasn't made with anything more in mind than providing the viewer with entertainment, I wasn't at all disappointed with any perceived historical flaws or inaccuracies with the transition from book to film.  I very much enjoyed this series and found it very entertaining.  Perfectly mindless entertainment for later in the evening when I didn't want to think about anything and certainly wasn't looking for any intellectual challenges.

But this series brought it all back with a sparkling clarity I wouldn't have expected.The faithfulness in keeping with the book was impressive given the scope of Follett's vision. Obviously changes had to made, both to accommodate the format and budget - but the filmmakers really captured the heart of what I would've considered an un-filmable project.What I find both interesting and enjoyable is that this isn't rated - and I'm going to guess that when it's finally aired outside of the pay channels - that the extremely brief nude and sexual situations, including incest, will be edited out. And editing, regardless of intent, will almost invariably degrade the finished product - so I would definitely recommend purchasing or renting this thru some venue.I'm not a huge fan of recent films that take place during the Middle Ages, since most filmmakers take ridiculous liberties with the rather horrifying and squalid world most average citizens like you and I dwelled in. The drab grayness, unpaved streets filled with feces and urine, unchecked facial and body acne, putrid mouth and body odor, and virtual non-existent medical care are all happily overlooked in favor of bright colors, flowers, and the moronic blind idealism found in Renaissance Fairs the world over. Sorry, ""Faires"". &lt;rolling eyeballs>But once in a while, if some care is taken and a semblance toward historical accuracy is made, I'll explore the world of the 11th-15th Centuries. And like 'The Name of the Rose' with Sean Connery - this series is a definite reward for those willing to overlook inaccuracy to be told a good story.This should really be considered a companion piece rather than a stand-alone product. To get the most from the film experience, I highly recommend reading Ken Follet's source novel.Finally, I would like to address the Amazon Tag of ""Anti-Catholic' or the Anti-Christian perspective. This is clearly a point of view that is, sadly today, all too common an acceptable stab in the entertainment field.

Well one would think but its on my to-read list and I hadn't thought I'd read it but the whole plot seemed strangely familiar.  But this isn't a bad thing because I absolutely loved the series.  Sure it had a few things that could have been better, but largely it was excellent and very captivating.Based on the book by Ken Follett, Pillars of the Earth has a very simple premise that is made much more complicated by the events of the time it is set in.  It is Tom Builder's dream to work on a cathedral.  He is a master stone mason and very good at his work, but having trouble finding jobs in the turbulent times after the King's death.  What makes this time so turbulent?  There is an usurper to the throne over the King's daughter and her infant son and the country is in an uproar as she fights the new King Stephen for her rightful place and to secure the throne for her young son.Mixed into this is Prior Phillip, a man dedicated to god but still ambitious in his own way.  He wants to see a cathedral built, and with Tom set in his path he sees a way to build the best cathedral ever.  But of course nothing is as easy as it seems, politics and jealousy reign high in this time and not all want to see a cathedral built or the prosperity it will bring to the area.  It will be years of struggle to try to build this building with so many tragedies along the way.Characters:Ian McShane as Waleran BigodRufus Sewell as Tom BuilderMatthew Macfadyen as Prior PhilipEddie Redmayne as Jack JacksonHayley Atwell as AlienaLiam Garrigan as Alfred BuilderTony Curran as King StephenSarah Parish as Regan HamleighDavid Oakes as William HamleighRobert Bathurst as Percy HamleighAlison Pill as Princess MaudeSam Claflin as RichardSkye Bennett as Martha BuilderEmily Holt as older MarthaGordon Pinsent as the ArchbishopNatalia W&ouml;rner as EllenAnatole Taubman as RemigiusDonald Sutherland as Earl BartholomewG&ouml;tz Otto as WalterSkye Lourie as ElisabethJody Halse as Johnny EightpenceDavid Bark Jones as FrancisKate Dickie as Agnes BuilderMarl Phelan as Otto BlackfaceTibor Pinter as Jacques ShareburgFreddie Boath as King Henry IIClive Wood as King Henry IDouglas Booth as EustaceMatt Devere as Robert of GloucesterFeodor Atkine as Abbot SugerKen Follett as a merchantAs you can see there were quite a few characters in this series just as a listing of main characters.  But I do have to say they were all fantastic!  There were some that were just so easy to hate and they did a wonderful job of being the bad guy.  Like always, Ian McShane was one of those bad guys (I don't think I've ever seen him play a nice person) and he was devious, dangerous, and many other scary attributes.  Tom Builder was sweet and I really enjoyed his character although some of his motivations confused me at times.  All of the actors and actresses portraying the role of the Hamleigh's were fantastic as well.  They were very believable and you could feel the ambition that the mother especially possessed.  The only character I really didn't connect to with Ellen.  Not to be too much of a spoiler, but with her background of being a nun, her character in the present time of the show is hard to believe with that inconsistency of her path.  I can see rebelling a little, but the extend that she changes/grew from that time period in her life makes me a little skeptical.As stated before I really liked the plot and notion of the series.  Even though the basic premise is about building a cathedral, there are so many sub plots and other things going on that it is really quite exciting.  But something to bear in mind when starting this series is that it contains some very mature themes.  There is nudity, cussing, violence, implied romance and much more.  Those opposed to these things probably shouldn't watch it.

Although most of the characters didn't quite fit my personal visualizations, outside of some totally weird CGI things, I found this thoroughly enjoyable, and spent entirely too much time engrossed in it. There was some intra-personal action & violence added for dramatic effect, such as a duel in the Shireing quarry between Jack & William Hamleigh's henchman, Walter, which I found pointless, and scenes of the cathedral city of Lincoln were flat out weird, since they showed Lincoln surrounded by mountains(if you've ever been in Lincolnshire, you'll know that it's less mountainous than Kansas).Still, the CG buildings were amazing. I've been in most of the great cathedrals in the UK, and I thought that some scenes must have been shot in, or of one of these grand edifices.If you enjoyed the book, by all means watch the series.

I didn't watch it on TV, knowing it would arrive on DVD shortly thereafter and, sure enough, it arrived on Blu Ray. I ordered it immediately and I've not been disappointed.Others can quibble about the series not following the book exactly but, in my view, that would be impossible, considering the scope of the work. The ""Making Of"" extra covers that point very well, explaining why they insisted on at least eight hours to do justice to Pillars. And do justice they did! All of the players were well-cast but Ian McShane stole the show with his complex portrayal of Bishop Bigod, an evil and corrupt man who believed completely that his machinations were justified by God.My wife pointed out, as the series neared it's end, that several of the cast members showed no aging, while others were made up to appear older. Again, I consider that to be a minor quibble, as are the previous remarks about the battle sequences. In fact, perhaps disbelief should be suspended in these areas. Just enjoy the show!As for the video quality? The Blu Ray is beautiful! Viewed on a 60"" Sony LED TV, with sound through a rather good sound system, I couldn't ask for more. I believe you'll agree with me.This is a series I and my wife will watch again and again. In fact, these disks may well induce me to read the book a third time.

This is well done here and the opposition between honest faith and twisted, rationalized ambition is well done.Also, it is accurate that cathedrals were built commonly to draw worshipers and traders and increase local commerce and income. We do not often see that in film.

1363869,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B003UD7J94,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","This excellent screen adaptation of the best selling book by Ken Follett has all the components one would look for: intrigue, mystery, drama, lush sets and costumes, great acting, and a story that propels itself from episode to episode to a fascinating conclusion. One need not be a cathedral aficionado to be drawn into the story, but this epic story of the construction of a great gothic cathedral is a rare treat for those who have either studied, or been fascinated by, medieval cathedral construction. The conception, birth, sicknesses, and eventual triumph of the project over many decades of time present a rare glimpse into what one of these massive projects must have been like.The story is adapted into eight episodes of about one hour each, with ongoing development of the multiple threads of storyline present in the tale. It can get a bit confusing at times: a few of the characters have enough physical semblance to confound the viewer, and the barrage of names can be a bit difficult to manage at first.

1363875,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B003UD7J94,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 5]","As a history buff with an particular fascination with the Gothic era, I had high hopes for this mini-series.  It promised not only the court intrigue and a particular view into an alien age, but at its core it was about the achievement of a new art from:  the Cathedrals that required the development of fundamental innovations in stonework, in structural engineering, and in the mobilization of communities, sometimes for centuries.  Instead, I found a film that drowned in graphic sex, horrendous violence, and two-dimensional characters.  It is full of ridiculous stereotypes about the Medieval era, though there are some redeeming features.  I say this less as a pedant than with disappointment that I could not become absorbed in a narrative with a sense of awe and longing to know more.  Alas, with its lurid details and melodramatic plot lines, I could not suspend my disbelief.  Even my high school daughter was disgusted at its lack of subtlety and finesse.  This is second rate.The plot is complicated, involving a sunken ship, secrets later uncovered because of a stolen ring, a coup that initiates a generation of civil war, and unscrupulous courtiers, both religious and secular.  Lower down, there is a master mason with a vision, who finds a situation in a village with an extraordinary Prior, who is not only going to build an early Gothic Cathedral, but revive the economy of an entire region.  Of course, this pits the Prior - a pious, honorable, good, and competent man - against the interests of aggressively evil rivals.  Obstacles to the Cathedral are thrown up, there is lots of violence and lust, but all's well that ends well in spite of many tragic injustices.There are some extremely good actors in this.  Unfortunately, the director largely squanders their talents.  Some of it is indeed moving, such as the love between the humble mason and the disgraced princess, but most of it fits into silly film conventions, like the princess' brother becoming a crusader to redeem himself over the 20 years, taking the most brutal vengeance when the time comes, or the working out of prophesies.If you want a kind of slashing swashbuckler with good v. evil, etc., this is passable.

1363876,A22VRIO50JMMQF,B003UD7J94,Roberto,"[2, 2]","I read the ""The Pillars of the Earth"" a few years ago and - as many other thousands of readers - I was pleased that they made a movie out of it. It was an opportunity to match the 12th century England that we built in our minds with the one provided by the movie (and probably certified by Follett himself).The 1000 pages book is not above reproach. The first third is really, really good. I don't think that I ever read such good storytelling. The second act is still very good, but it was more traditionally developed (was it just impossible to keep the narrative of the first part?). On the last part, things start to flat and only at times it came close to the mastery of the first act.Nevertheless, Ken Follett even on his weakest moments is an amazing storyteller. I really cannot thing of anyone better on that regards.We cannot fall in the trap that a book is better than the movie. It is always is. That's clich&eacute;. We cannot expect that a movie to be a perfect recreation of the book. It is never like that. There were rare cases in the film history that a director gave such a vision to the book that the movie became a work of art in its own way. Kubrick is a common example.It is not the case of this miniseries. And whoever has such an expectation shouldn't bother to watch these DVDs. My first and only reason to watch this miniseries was the plain old curiosity. I had some expectations to watch a well made production, that's true, but I was basically moved by curiosity. I was pretty sure that the miniseries would be technically well-made, respectful to those that read the book.I was not disappointed. The production design, sets, costumes, sound, editing, photography and all other technical aspects were made according to today's Hollywood standards. The big surprise for me was the cast. What a great cast they pulled together! The main force behind is Ian McShane. I don't remember the book to be such centered around Waleran, but the miniseries is. Ian McShane has such a shinning presence that everything else moves around him. This is a performance that would be hard to forget. I cannot miss the opportunity to mention Hayley Atwell. I am still seduced by her.""The Pillars of the Earth"" has many moving parts and an adaptation had the risk to expose some holes. They indeed made a few changes, but the cast was so competent that I only noticed the flaws after watching the whole miniseries and, even so, after thinking hard on that (in the process, I discovered some flaws in the book too). The end of the book and miniseries is where the difference is the greatest. But then, there was no risk for the miniseries to fall apart because it was the end and there was nothing else to be said. The miniseries is more cynical, which may represent Follett's more recent wave of cynicism.Maybe if Pasolini had directed this, it would be another work of art. I am giving 4 stars basically because of the cast, to the production and to the fact that I didn't expect to be disappointed and I wasn't.",4,Good job everybody,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3022,"['read', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'many', 'other', 'thousands', 'readers', 'was', 'pleased', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'opportunity', 'match', '12th', 'century', 'England', 'built', 'minds', 'one', 'provided', 'movie', 'probably', 'certified', 'Follett', '.The', '1000', 'pages', 'book', 'not', 'reproach', 'first', 'third', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'read', 'such', 'good', 'storytelling', 'second', 'act', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'traditionally', 'developed', 'was', 'just', 'impossible', 'keep', 'narrative', 'first', 'part', 'last', 'part', 'things', 'start', 'flat', 'only', 'times', 'came', 'close', 'mastery', 'first', 'act.Nevertheless', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'even', 'weakest', 'moments', 'amazing', 'storyteller', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'thing', 'anyone', 'better', 'regards.We', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'trap', 'book', 'better', 'movie', 'always', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'perfect', 'recreation', 'book', 'never', 'were', 'rare', 'cases', 'film', 'history', 'director', 'gave', 'vision', 'book', 'movie', 'became', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'way', 'Kubrick', 'common', 'example.It', 'not', 'case', 'miniseries', 'expectation', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'first', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'was', 'plain', 'old', 'curiosity', 'had', 'expectations', 'watch', 'well', 'made', 'production', 'true', 'was', 'basically', 'moved', 'curiosity', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'miniseries', 'would', 'be', 'technically', 'well-made', 'respectful', 'read', 'book.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'production', 'design', 'sets', 'costumes', 'sound', 'editing', 'photography', 'other', 'technical', 'aspects', 'were', 'made', 'according', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'cast', 'What', 'great', 'cast', 'pulled', 'together', 'main', 'force', 'behind', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'book', 'be', 'such', 'centered', 'Waleran', 'miniseries', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'shinning', 'presence', 'everything', 'else', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'forget', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'mention', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'am', 'still', 'seduced', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'many', 'moving', 'parts', 'adaptation', 'had', 'risk', 'expose', 'holes', 'indeed', 'made', 'few', 'changes', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'competent', 'only', 'noticed', 'flaws', 'watching', 'whole', 'miniseries', 'even', 'so', 'thinking', 'hard', 'process', 'discovered', 'flaws', 'book', 'too', 'end', 'book', 'miniseries', 'where', 'difference', 'greatest', 'then', 'was', 'risk', 'miniseries', 'fall', 'apart', 'was', 'end', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'be', 'said', 'miniseries', 'more', 'cynical', 'may', 'represent', 'Follett', 'more', 'recent', 'wave', 'cynicism.Maybe', 'Pasolini', 'had', 'directed', 'would', 'be', 'work', 'art', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'basically', 'cast', 'production', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't""]",N/A

But those titles would reflect a bit more boredom than I actually experienced with Pillars of the Earth (and my titles just weren't really very clever). So instead of expressing my frustration with this miniseries in the title of my review, I'll just say it.I actually thought that Pillars of the Earth started off quite well. The story seemed to be progressing towards a climactic, epic finish. After the fifth episode I was sure that something big was coming. The sixth episode had me convinced that I was in for a great finale. But what a let down the final double episode was. I don't know...the story just didn't go out with a bang for me. The double episode seemed to try to cram another 6 hours of material and history into what ultimately was just a two-hour time slot. For example, while the first 6 episodes cover a time span of several years, I think that the story jumps almost 20 years from the start of the 2-hour finale to the end. But worst of all it just seemed to end with a fizzle; no climactic, epic finish here.I do think that the acting was quite good. The cast sold me on coming back for more to see how all of their roles played out in the building of cathedrals during the middle of the twelfth century in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It was interesting and I was entertained.But unlike Starz' recent hitSpartacus: Blood and Sand, I won't be adding The Pillars of the Earth to my Blu Ray collection.

Well, when I heard that there was to be a mini-series based on the book, I was predictably excited. The show may not be a faithful rendition of the novel (after all the book itself was epic in terms of number of pages and story arcs) but it does a suitably credible job of condensing the novel into 8 hours of film.The story is set in medieval England, circa 12th century, and it revolves around the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. There are many themes in this story - church politics and corruption; greed and power revolving around the fight over the throne of England; family, friendship, and passion, amongst others. Some of the central characters (and some shortlived-characters) are Tom Builder (played almost to perfection by Rufus Sewell); Prior Phillip (Matthew McFadyen who also played Mr. Darcy inPride & Prejudiceopposite Keira Knightley; the morally bankrupt church official Father Waleran Bigod (Ian McShane delivering a truly repulsive performance); Earl of Shiring, Bartholomew (Donald Sutherland); the earl's daughter Aliena (Hayley Atweel); fatherless Jack Jackson (a brilliant Eddie Redmayne), and many more. Despite having many familiar and high-profile actors in this show, the actors do a credible job of infusing their roles with the specific characteristics of a particular character (so that for example, I'm not imagining McFadyen as Darcy, in fact far from it - he totally inhabits his role as the devout and unwavering Prior Phillip).The cinematography is excellent, and there are also loads of sexy scenes in this production (nudity abounds). At times, I did feel that the director and producers got carried away with all the sex scenes, but in the final analysis, these scenes did enhance the storyline and added the requisite sexy factor to increase the production's appeal (?) yet the story is well-told and could have survived on that merit alone.
