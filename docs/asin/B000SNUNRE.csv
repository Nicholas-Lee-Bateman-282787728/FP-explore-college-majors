As far as horror goes this show should grab one's attention more than any other based on the fact that it's supposed to be based on ""Eye Witness"" accounts. To me that is where this show really provides a great resource for christian study.I firmly believe in the God of the Bible and as such I believe there is a devil. This show for me was like getting a class on demon activity. One episode (the pilot I believe) had a 16 year old boy who was sick with cancer and kept telling his parents about an evil spirit (a big nasty devil spirit) that was tormenting him. They paid him no attention and that foul spirit first terrofied him (remember Satan is a roaring lion seeking out those whom he can devour) and next alienated him from his family. Next, the spirit corrupted and infiltrated his mind. The family eventually had him institutionalized due to the fact that, ""That spirit wanted him to hurt the family.""Where the series is based on eye witness accounts (and I'm sure that some creative sub-plots have been added). The strength of this as an educational piece comes from your own knowledge of the bible. Think about the behavior of the spirits Christ and the apostles cast out. Think about the records of King Saul's torment. Think about (and study if you haven't read up on it) about the witchcraft of the old testament. The main things you'll see is that the spirits deceive, they install fear as fast as they can, they want to torment the individual, and they alienate the individual away from those who could help them. I was actually surprised at how honest the program was when it showed how many of these  spirits despised biblical passages being read.A word of warning! The show does seem to advocate some spiritualist principals (mediums and the such), so you have to keep that in mind.For those of you who are not christian and just looking for a scarey, yet interesting show.... It's not blood and guts it suspense and it's well done. This is coming from a guy who doesn't like horror...Bottom Line: Great education on evil spirits if you know your bible and know what to look for.",4,"Christian Review of ""a haunting""",1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,2208,"['christian', 'review', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Now', 'most', 'who', 'watch', 'program', 'do', 'so', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'As', 'far', 'horror', 'show', 'should', 'grab', 'one', 'attention', 'more', 'other', 'based', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Eye', 'Witness', 'accounts', 'where', 'show', 'really', 'great', 'resource', 'christian', 'study.I', 'firmly', 'believe', 'God', 'Bible', 'such', 'believe', 'devil', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'class', 'demon', 'activity', 'One', 'episode', 'pilot', 'believe', 'had', '16', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'sick', 'cancer', 'kept', 'telling', 'parents', 'evil', 'spirit', 'big', 'nasty', 'devil', 'spirit', 'was', 'tormenting', 'paid', 'attention', 'foul', 'spirit', 'first', 'terrofied', 'remember', 'Satan', 'roaring', 'lion', 'seeking', 'out', 'whom', 'can', 'devour', 'next', 'alienated', 'family', 'Next', 'spirit', 'corrupted', 'infiltrated', 'mind', 'family', 'eventually', 'had', 'institutionalized', 'due', 'fact', 'spirit', 'wanted', 'hurt', 'family', 'Where', 'series', 'based', 'eye', 'witness', 'accounts', ""'m"", 'sure', 'creative', 'sub-plots', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'strength', 'educational', 'piece', 'own', 'knowledge', 'bible', 'Think', 'behavior', 'spirits', 'Christ', 'apostles', 'cast', 'out', 'Think', 'records', 'King', 'Saul', 'torment', 'Think', 'study', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'up', 'witchcraft', 'old', 'testament', 'main', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'spirits', 'deceive', 'install', 'fear', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'want', 'torment', 'individual', 'alienate', 'individual', 'away', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'honest', 'program', 'was', 'when', 'showed', 'how', 'many', 'spirits', 'despised', 'biblical', 'passages', 'being', 'read.A', 'word', 'warning', 'show', 'seem', 'advocate', 'spiritualist', 'principals', 'mediums', 'such', 'so', 'have', 'keep', 'mind.For', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'christian', 'just', 'looking', 'scarey', 'yet', 'interesting', 'show', 'not', 'blood', 'guts', 'suspense', 'well', 'done', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'horror', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Great', 'education', 'evil', 'spirits', 'know', 'bible', 'know', 'what', 'look']",N/A

If you had never seen these shows before, you would have no idea what was going on! What were they thinking?  I almost took my box set back to the store thinking there was an audio problem.  I was extremely disappointed as I had been wanting to purchase these episodes for a long time, but to buy them individually from Discovery was way too expensive. All 16 episodes would be around $160.00.I actually called customer relations at Discovery, they have nothing to do with this box set.  The producer decided he could ""reach"" more people via another route other than going through the Discovery Stores.  You can actually buy the first six episodes through Discovery, as they are on television, but at $10.00 an episode.  I admit that $20-25 is a great deal on the box set for season 1 and 2, but without the narration it is worthless.

The spooky narrator was silent and the shows started silent and didnt make sense. I thought I better check Amazon to see the latest details.

I emailed the company and the told me to send it back and they'll send out a copy within a week. What a inconvenience. Im so sick of buying defective products then having to go to the post office to mail them back to the sellers. Plus I have to wait an extra two weeks (with shipping) just to watch the show. The show is good but its unrealistic and feels more like a cheaply made horror movie sans the gore. I do enjoy some of the shows they've had and I love the narrator of the show, probably second best to Robert Stack. I recommend this show to people who like Unsolved Mysteries, only if they wished the program was extended by forty minutes or more. The dvd is pretty bare and looks like it was made for pretty cheap.

Most of the stories are about people who move into homes, and after a couple weeks or so, discover certain events happen that can't be explained.  Each story takes place over different parts of America (though sometimes they go overseas, such as one story taking place in Ireland).Perfectly normal people going about their typical routine similar to you and me, however, they have to deal with contant unexplainable events such as lights flickering, shadow figures, waking up and hearing loud noises or seeing ghostly images, etc.Each story contains enough detail to be different from the other ones.  The fact that each story has different events happening means you can't predict when or how something unexplainable is going to happen, which in turn makes the shows that much more frightening.All the stories are based off actual events, and sometimes there's even evidence by way of pictures or strange sounds from tape that back up what's been going on.

This TV series, collected on 3 DVDs, re-enacts several famous hauntings along with interviews with those who claim they have experienced them. The re-enactments are usually quite good, and the series stretches its low budget very well, using good acting, clever editing, sound effects and appropriate stock music into a chilling mixture. Almost all the people being interviewed seem exceptionally lucid and sincere, which makes the stories seem more plausible and therefore more chilling. In fact, this could practically be called 'Chiller Theater' as each of the roughly 50-minute episodes made me jump at least twice, and I don't scare easily. There's lots of creepiness to be had here, and ""A Haunting"" has some of the best made-for-TV chills out there. This is well-worth your time when you want a good scare.On the downside, it's frightening how cheaply these episodes were transferred to DVD. Not only are there no extras, but there are no subtitles, no foreign language tracks, and - this really sets a new low - each episode consists of an entire chapter in the menu! I'm used to older or niche series being given the bargain basement treatment (even great series like MASH and Columbo seemed to have been rushed into DVD release with little care), but I was surprised at how cut-rate the actual DVD production is. As an added frustration, all three DVDs have exactly the same artwork on the slipcases and you won't realize which volume you are looking at unless you closely examine the listing near the bottom of the back cover.

They act out a true stories of hauntings and demonic possessions and they do a great job! The acting is decent and the stories will give you chills.  I think the narrator does an excellent job. His voice alone is creepy.  Sometimes, the real families speak in shadow because they don't want you to know their identity, which you can't blame.

The effects are sufficiently spooky too.  My only problem - do the hauntings all have to be evil and demonic?  And they all start out the same - oblivious families moving into abandoned homes and finding out that they are haunted.  Even though they are terrified out of their minds, they insist on staying in these demon-infested dwellings.  I love a good ghost story as much as most do, but it's like they purposely showcased homes that have evil and demonic entities.  If I had known that, I would not have bought these DVD's.  So maybe my purpose here is just to warn some that if you would rather avoid viewing strictly demonic and evil spirited hauntings, don't buy this.  Stick with Ghost Hunters.

I can't think of any big screen movie or other tv show that has given me more chills when viewed in a dark room at night. And what a relief to have horror without a lot of silly gore. Just a ""true"" (supposedly)tale of haunting.That being said I hesitated a long time to order these, because I wanted the amazon price but was scared off because of the claims of no narrator - even from some recent reviews after you would have expected the defective dvd sets to have been recalled. However, I'm happy to report that the narrator appears to be on the set I just ordered (though I haven't listened to all the programs) and for those who have also hesitated, I just thought to reassure you that these seem okay.One note, I don't really understand why Discovery seems to imply that all ghosts and hauntings are ""evil"".  It seems the majority probably wouldn't be -- if ghosts are real. But the evil nature of all the selected hauntings is continually harped on in this show.  It seems an odd note, but, in view of the chill factor, perhaps they only choose to reenact those that they do consider ""evil"" and leave the tame hauntings unchosen.Anyway, this is a great set and well worth having!

Each show is composed of very well made and atmospheric reenactments interspersed with eyewitness interviews.  Overlaid over each story is the creepy, measured voice of a narrator who describes the events.  The show is exceptionally effective.  Most episodes have at least some unnerving moments and some episodes are downright scary.  Viewers interested in the paranormal should love this series as should people who like horror movies.Below is a short description of each episode in Seasons 1 & 2.  The number in parentheses is my ""scariness rating""; scale = 1-5 with 5 being the scariest.

(4)Hell House - Well known parapsychologists are called to investigate a haunted house in Connecticut (3)Cursed - Disturbing paranormal events center around an Arizona woman (1)Echoes from the Grave - A family of eight moves into a creepy house in Baltimore (3)Darkness Follows - A house is haunted by the demonic entity of a caretaker who performed illicit abortions on the property (5)Gateway to Hell - An ancient well in the basement of a Kentucky music hall is the center of evil (4)The Diabolical - The improper use of a Ouija board turns a minor haunting into full scale demonic intrusion focused on a special-needs child (3)Demon Child - A boys imaginary playmate seems to be the ghost of a murdered child (5)Sallie's House - The ghost of a young girl interacts with a couple in Kansas (3)Hungry Dead - Eastern spirits harass the two teenage daughters of an American businessmen living in a company house in Taiwan (1)Where Demons Dwell - A young Connecticut boy becomes possessed when he helps his sister move into a new rental property (2)Ghost Soldier - A woman becomes obsessed, and has a relationship of sorts, with the photograph of a soldier killed in Vietnam (2)House of the Dead - A family is torn apart when they move into a haunted house in Maryland (3)Dark Forest - Spirits walk the woods and stalk the house of a 100 year old farmhouse in western New York that used to be a stopover on a forgotten road (3)A Haunting in Florida - A young family moves into a house and discovers that the previous owner fled with a half eaten meal on the table (4)",5,Good and Scary,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,2531,"['Haunting', 'documentary', 'series', 'allegedly', 'true', 'tales', 'hauntings', 'ghosts', 'paranormal', 'show', 'composed', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'atmospheric', 'reenactments', 'interspersed', 'eyewitness', 'interviews', 'Overlaid', 'story', 'creepy', 'measured', 'voice', 'narrator', 'who', 'events', 'show', 'exceptionally', 'effective', 'Most', 'episodes', 'have', 'least', 'unnerving', 'moments', 'episodes', 'are', 'downright', 'scary', 'Viewers', 'interested', 'paranormal', 'should', 'love', 'series', 'should', 'people', 'who', 'horror', 'movies.Below', 'short', 'description', 'episode', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'number', 'parentheses', 'scariness', 'rating', 'scale', '=', '1-5', '5', 'being', 'scariest', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'throughout.The', 'Lake', 'Club', 'Horror', 'unsettled', 'ghost', 'bartender', 'owners', 'workers', 'nightclub', '2', 'Haunting', 'Summerwind', 'Various', 'owners', 'start', 'renovate', 'lakefront', 'mansion', 'Wisconsin', 'one', 'long', '4', 'Hell', 'House', 'Well', 'known', 'parapsychologists', 'are', 'called', 'investigate', 'haunted', 'house', 'Connecticut', '3', 'Cursed', 'Disturbing', 'paranormal', 'events', 'center', 'Arizona', 'woman', '1', 'Echoes', 'Grave', 'family', 'eight', 'moves', 'creepy', 'house', 'Baltimore', '3', 'Darkness', 'Follows', 'house', 'haunted', 'demonic', 'entity', 'caretaker', 'who', 'performed', 'illicit', 'abortions', 'property', '5', 'Gateway', 'Hell', 'ancient', 'well', 'basement', 'Kentucky', 'music', 'hall', 'center', 'evil', '4', 'Diabolical', 'improper', 'use', 'Ouija', 'board', 'minor', 'haunting', 'full', 'scale', 'demonic', 'intrusion', 'focused', 'special-needs', 'child', '3', 'Demon', 'Child', 'boys', 'imaginary', 'playmate', 'be', 'ghost', 'murdered', 'child', '5', 'Sallie', 'House', 'ghost', 'young', 'girl', 'interacts', 'couple', 'Kansas', '3', 'Hungry', 'Dead', 'Eastern', 'spirits', 'harass', 'two', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'American', 'businessmen', 'living', 'company', 'house', 'Taiwan', '1', 'Where', 'Demons', 'Dwell', 'young', 'Connecticut', 'boy', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'when', 'sister', 'move', 'new', 'rental', 'property', '2', 'Ghost', 'Soldier', 'woman', 'obsessed', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'photograph', 'soldier', 'killed', 'Vietnam', '2', 'House', 'Dead', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'when', 'move', 'haunted', 'house', 'Maryland', '3', 'Dark', 'Forest', 'Spirits', 'walk', 'woods', 'stalk', 'house', '100', 'year', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'western', 'New', 'York', 'used', 'be', 'stopover', 'forgotten', 'road', '3', 'Haunting', 'Florida', 'young', 'family', 'house', 'discovers', 'previous', 'owner', 'fled', 'half', 'eaten', 'meal', 'table', '4']",N/A
