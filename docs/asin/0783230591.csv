63796,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,0783230591,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[6, 9]","This film is grand in scale with cinematography and special effects that could not be bettered.  The river's rage is nothing compared to the characters undergoing their conflict.  Sissy Spacek, as usual, turns in another stunning performance (when has she ever been less than excellent in any movie.  Definitely, along with Meryl Streep, the finest actress of her generation...I call her my modern ""Barbara Stanwyck"").  Her portrayal of Mae, the wife, is unflinchingly loyal, yet strong and courageous and feisty.  Her determination is what makes this film what it is.  No less excellent is Scott Glenn as the antagonist/protaganist who believes in what he is doing totally.  Also meriting praise are the two children.  They are fantastic!  The direction is colorful and nearly flawless.  I agree with the previous reviewer though about Mel Gibson.  His character, a mite too proud, is a little difficult to take sometimes.  He definitely could have shown more bite in the scene where he is attacked by the strikers.  The scene where he confronts Scott Glenn in the office is his best scene in this movie.  But he definitely could have done a better job with the character.  He seems miscast at times.  Sissy Spacek makes him look good but his portrayal of the character lacks the nuances necessary to make us believe in what he is doing.  It is Spacek that gives us the sympathy for her family.  I wish they would have cast Gary Busey in Gibson's role.  I think he could have done wonders with it!  Other than that, this film is outstanding and I would definitely give it 5 stars if it hadn't been for Gibson's uneven portrayal.  Spacek deserved her Oscar nomination for this movie.  The DVD contains a theatrical trailer, scene selection and a two page commentary on the highlights of the film.  ALso included are Bios of the stars.  Other than that, nothing else is included.  The sound and video are fine!  This is a film worth adding to your collection!  A true testament to the American fighting Spirit.  It certainly is no ""Grapes of Wrath"" but then, nothing ever will be!",4,FINE FILM BUT GIBSON IS THE FLAW IN IT!,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2079,"['film', 'grand', 'scale', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bettered', 'river', 'rage', 'nothing', 'compared', 'characters', 'undergoing', 'conflict', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'usual', 'stunning', 'performance', 'when', 'ever', 'been', 'less', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'finest', 'actress', 'generation', 'call', 'modern', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'portrayal', 'Mae', 'wife', 'unflinchingly', 'loyal', 'yet', 'strong', 'courageous', 'feisty', 'determination', 'what', 'film', 'what', 'No', 'less', 'excellent', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'antagonist/protaganist', 'who', 'what', 'doing', 'totally', 'Also', 'meriting', 'praise', 'are', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'fantastic', 'direction', 'colorful', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'mite', 'too', 'proud', 'little', 'difficult', 'take', 'sometimes', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'bite', 'scene', 'where', 'attacked', 'strikers', 'scene', 'where', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'office', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'character', 'miscast', 'times', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'look', 'good', 'portrayal', 'character', 'nuances', 'necessary', 'make', 'believe', 'what', 'doing', 'Spacek', 'sympathy', 'family', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Gibson', 'role', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'Other', 'film', 'outstanding', 'would', 'definitely', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Gibson', 'uneven', 'portrayal', 'Spacek', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'movie', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'scene', 'selection', 'two', 'page', 'commentary', 'highlights', 'film', 'ALso', 'included', 'are', 'Bios', 'stars', 'Other', 'nothing', 'else', 'included', 'sound', 'video', 'are', 'fine', 'film', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'true', 'testament', 'American', 'fighting', 'Spirit', 'certainly', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'then', 'nothing', 'ever', 'will', 'be']",N/A

This, however, would not be entirely fair of me. This film superbly depicts the crisis many families are forced to endure when caught within the gears of economic &quot;creative destruction.&quot;  It  is therefore morally imperative that we do not turn our head away from this tough to handle subject matter. This beautiful film reminds us  that real people often suffer the consequences of our abstract principles.  Does this alone invalidate these principles?  No, but we should  always be cognizant of the flesh and blood dimensions of our decisions. Mel Gibson gives a powerful performance as a proud man who is losing  the battle to save the family farm.  The wife played by Sissy Spacek desires to be loyal to her husband while still remaining pragmatic  on how best to stabilize the family's rapidly deteriorating financial situation.Scott Glenn plays the real hero in this movie.  His character is a fair and honorable business man who warns the farmer of impending doom. The river according to all reasonable expectations will eventually destroy the farm.  Even the farmer grudgingly concedes this possibility.  The Glenn character offers the farmer a way out, but the farmer is bull headed and places his love for the agrarian way of life over common  sense.  Is Gibson's character idealistic and worthy of praise, or merely stubborn and selfish?  Each person viewing &quot;The River&quot; will have to  decide this for themselves.The great economist, Joseph Schumpeter, originated the paradoxical term &quot;creative destruction.&quot;  Throughout history, there are always winners and  losers whenever new technology replaces the older methods of earning a living.  Tractors, for instance, destroyed the relevancy of horses  and ploughs.  This more efficient manner of tilling the soil dramatically brought down the cost of growing food.  The result is that the typical  consumer today spends comparatively little for vegetables at the grocery store.  Unfortunately, a severe price has to be paid by those farmers who  lack the ability to adjust to these improvements.  At the beginning of the previous century, roughly half of the American population earned  its income through farming.  In the year 2000 the number has dropped to about 3%!  An educated guess is that a further drop off will  inevitably continue to occur.  What should a viable democratic society do to address this issue?  Is a Laissez Faire response appropriate, a  Socialist micro management of production, or something in between?  A neo-conservative such as myself opts for the third choice. The  viewer once again is free to arrive at their own conclusions. I strongly, though, urge everyone to view &quot;The River&quot; at least once every few  years.  It might even behoove high school teachers and university professors to consider making this film a requirement for student credit. 'The River&quot; is among my favorite films of all time.

Country was a better take on this topic of the early 80s-people losing their family farms to the banks. Country had some show stopping moments of dialog delivered by Jessica Lange. Jessica seemed less a victim than the two main characters here. There is little triumph in the survival of Mel and Sissy.Jessica was more Joan of Arc than merely a survivor.One of my friends complained about a scene in The River that seemed contrived and too obviously symbolic of workers chasing a deer that wandered into their workplace. I reminded him that I had always viewed the Deer Hunter as having very heavy handed symbolism, but he had never complained about Deer Hunter.

I read the reviews before buying this flick and I was astonished at some of the feedback on this movie. One four-star rating attacks Gibson's character, especially due to his nonreaction to being spat on by a striking worker due to his part as a ""scab"" at a factory. Did you really expect Mel Gibson to act like his character on ""Braveheart"" and try to impale the character that spat on him? He's playing a character that obviously has little tolerance to fight back because of it. Obviously, his family is at hard times and he simply saw that there was little difference between himself and the strikers. They're all just trying to keep their families afloat, is all. Mel Gibson played a terrific part in this movie and he was brilliant in every scene.The movie has a lot to do with the 1980's recession that is plaguing farms throughout the state of Tennessee, not to mention the constant flooding of the river that is threatening to wash away everything that the farmers worked hard for.

63815,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,0783230591,Westley,"[4, 5]","Sissy Spacek received her fourth Oscar nomination for her role in 1984's ""The River.""  She plays a farm wife, struggling to keep her family intact while her husband (Mel Gibson) tries to save their farm.  The farm abuts a small river, which seems to flood every time it rains.  The flooding ruins their crops and puts the family at constant peril of bankruptcy.  Add to this mixture Scott Glenn, who plays a scheming developer; he wants to buy up all the land and have the government build a dam to flood the valley.  Gibson and Spacek refuse to sell their land, and Gibson even takes work at a local mill to stave off creditors.  Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Gibson, he is replacing striking workers and gets branded a scab.""The River"" tackles a very worth topic - the farming crisis of the 1980s, when many small farmers lost their land for a variety of economic reasons.  However, it also tries to address unions, scab workers, and several other social issues.  By doing so, the message of the film ends up being a bit jumbled.  There also are several unbelievable scenes; in particular, there are several scenes where a crowd reacts in unison, all set to swelling music.Some viewers are likely to find Gibson's character overly stubborn and aloof.  I didn't have a negative reaction to him; he's meant to represent, I think, the many quiet men who fight for their families.  These kind of men, though, often are very emotionally expressive, which can make watching them onscreen rather frustrating.  I found Scott Glenn's character more problematic.  He is supposed to be the villain, but he starts off far too nice before taking a nasty (and abrupt) turn very late in the picture.  Fortunately, Sissy Spacek's character is much more fully rounded, and she gives a very good performance.  Her performance makes the movie (barely) worth a look.",2,"""Sooner or later there's gonna be too much rain.""",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1848,"['Sissy', 'Spacek', 'received', 'fourth', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', '1984', 'River', 'farm', 'wife', 'struggling', 'keep', 'family', 'intact', 'husband', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'save', 'farm', 'farm', 'small', 'river', 'flood', 'time', 'flooding', 'crops', 'family', 'constant', 'peril', 'bankruptcy', 'Add', 'mixture', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'who', 'scheming', 'developer', 'buy', 'up', 'land', 'have', 'government', 'build', 'dam', 'flood', 'valley', 'Gibson', 'Spacek', 'refuse', 'sell', 'land', 'Gibson', 'even', 'work', 'local', 'mill', 'stave', 'off', 'creditors', 'Unfortunately', 'unbeknownst', 'Gibson', 'replacing', 'striking', 'workers', 'branded', 'scab', 'River', 'very', 'worth', 'topic', 'farming', 'crisis', '1980s', 'when', 'many', 'small', 'farmers', 'lost', 'land', 'variety', 'economic', 'reasons', 'However', 'also', 'address', 'unions', 'scab', 'workers', 'several', 'other', 'social', 'issues', 'doing', 'so', 'message', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'jumbled', 'also', 'are', 'several', 'unbelievable', 'scenes', 'particular', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'crowd', 'unison', 'set', 'swelling', 'music.Some', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'Gibson', 'character', 'overly', 'stubborn', 'aloof', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'negative', 'reaction', 'meant', 'represent', 'think', 'many', 'quiet', 'men', 'who', 'fight', 'families', 'kind', 'men', 'often', 'are', 'very', 'emotionally', 'expressive', 'can', 'make', 'watching', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'found', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'character', 'more', 'problematic', 'supposed', 'be', 'villain', 'far', 'too', 'nice', 'taking', 'nasty', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'very', 'late', 'picture', 'Fortunately', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'rounded', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'performance', 'movie', 'barely', 'look']",N/A
