1286479,A24PTVSZSM8968,B002SAMMF6,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty standard television movie. It is about how a fireman who has lost his wife befriends a writer who he saves from an apartment fire. I won't give away the plot but suffice it to say that it is fairly typical for this kind of movie. That being said, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch, mostly because the characters are interesting and likable and the plot doesn't involve any violence or explicit material. This lends an air of realism to the story. The only thing that's a little odd about this one is that the female character seems a bit like a stalker as she sneaks up and takes photos of people for books she is supposedly writing. Fortunately, these scenes are short and don't detract significantly from the story. If you like a low-key and wholesome love story, it's worth checking this out.",4,Pretty good for a TV movie,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,818,"['pretty', 'standard', 'television', 'movie', 'how', 'fireman', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'writer', 'who', 'apartment', 'fire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'suffice', 'say', 'fairly', 'typical', 'kind', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'mostly', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'likable', 'plot', ""n't"", 'involve', 'violence', 'explicit', 'material', 'air', 'realism', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'little', 'odd', 'one', 'female', 'character', 'bit', 'stalker', 'up', 'photos', 'people', 'books', 'supposedly', 'writing', 'Fortunately', 'scenes', 'are', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'significantly', 'story', 'like', 'low-key', 'wholesome', 'love', 'story', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

She works in the same office with her best friend, who is being married at the opening of the movie.

He just happens to be passing by her place when the fire is getting out of control. Grace's second chance at life gives her a fresh perspective and it spills over in gratitude to the firefighter who saved her. There are barriers between them, however. He still wears his wedding ring and barely goes through the motions of living, and she sports a flashy engagement ring.She makes an awkward attempt to help him by setting him up with a coworker, but eventually does help him start to find pleasure in living again.

1286518,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B002SAMMF6,mk,"[5, 5]","Yes, these Hallmark love stories can be quite predictable and overly sugary.  This one, I felt started somewhat slow but then develops into a very pleasant, interesting, relationship story.It's not really a romantic comedy where the main players initially can't stand each other or have a misunderstanding for the first half of the movie, and/or there's a gimmick, e.g., they have to pretend to be married for some special event even though they 'hate' each other.  There's no problem with that, but this one simply stresses the interactions between decent people.  Plus, even though there is comedy here, it's light and non-obtrusive.Briefly: two people both with deep hurts cross paths, so to speak.  One's a fireman(Mark Consuelos), not wanting anything to do with finding a relationship, saves the other, a successful, apparently happily, engaged, businesswoman(Chandra West), from a fire.  She, in turn, reaches out to him in thanks and in a way rescues him, too.All the characters come across nice and supportive in there own ways.  There's no mean people here like a back stabbing ex-friend or a creepy fiance. There just different people with different needs.  And the leads go through a wonderfully, warm process of self(and of course, of each other) discovery and growth.The ending offers the possibility of one of those frantic, crazy finales, but then turns quite reasonable and sensible.  All's well that ends well.  And this one does. If you're in need of something more gritty or less certain, seek other fair to watch, this is pure romantic escapism.Mark Consuelos born in Zaragoza, Spain is married in real life to Kelly Ripa both from All My Children fame, and Chandra West, born in Canada, performed recently in The Gates.
