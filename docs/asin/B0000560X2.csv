I was so glad to hear it was coming out on DVD and was suprised to find out that it was gonna be packaged with another movie called Terror Tract. I had never heard of it, but found out that John Ritter was in it. Ultimately, both movies are very good in different ways. Cherry Falls is a dark, sadistic slasher movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The extremely talented Brittany Murphy is in it as well as the very funny Jay Mohr who plays it serious in this one. This movie - comparable to Scream, Heathers and American Pie, will have you guessing who is killing the town virgins and why. Unlike most horror movies this movie never tires or bores and has very good acting and a very good script. It's a shame it didn't get a theatrical release, but at least the DVD isn't a butchered version like the basic cable version one was. Terror Tract reminds me alot of Tales From The Crypt; Very spooky and silly at the same time. Its about a real estate agent trying to sell a newly married couple a home and each house they visit has a horrifying tale about why the previous owners moved, leading into little short stories. Not as smart or as clever as Cherry Falls, but very entertaining and very eerie. There aren't any special features on this dvd... And both movies come on just one disc....so its easy to have yourself a night of chills without getting up. And you might not wanna watch these alone.....",5,A Great DVD To Own With Two Very Entertaining Movies On It,985305600,"03 23, 2001",2001,1541,"['real', 'gore', 'bad', 'language', 'express', 'how', 'were', 'really', 'feeling', 'story', 'edge', 'gone', 'due', 'editing', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'hear', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'suprised', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'packaged', 'movie', 'called', 'Terror', 'Tract', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'found', 'out', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'Ultimately', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'different', 'ways', 'Cherry', 'Falls', 'dark', 'sadistic', 'slasher', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'who', 'serious', 'one', 'movie', 'comparable', 'Scream', 'Heathers', 'American', 'Pie', 'will', 'have', 'guessing', 'who', 'killing', 'town', 'virgins', 'why', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'movie', 'never', 'bores', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'least', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'butchered', 'version', 'basic', 'cable', 'version', 'one', 'was', 'Terror', 'Tract', 'alot', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Very', 'spooky', 'silly', 'same', 'time', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'trying', 'sell', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'home', 'house', 'visit', 'horrifying', 'tale', 'why', 'previous', 'owners', 'moved', 'leading', 'little', 'short', 'stories', 'Not', 'smart', 'as', 'clever', 'Cherry', 'Falls', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'eerie', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'dvd', 'movies', 'come', 'just', 'one', 'disc', 'easy', 'have', 'night', 'chills', 'getting', 'up', 'might', 'not', 'wan', 'watch', 'alone', '..']",Terror Tract VHS

We just finished watching it (I haven't seen it since it was on TV last summer; and I have to say.....it's not bad. Dark yes; but then I write a lot of Dark stories too...vampires to Dark Willow and such. But there's one thing I have to say, this isn't Really That much like Scream as much as its like Scream 3.....and another movie that I know has more of a cult following then it used too......one of my favorite flicks by the name.....of Sleepaway Camp. Sleepaway Camp; strange as it is....(and great as it is goes with the Original girl in this movie.....The one by the name of Laura Lee Sherman ( Now I won't get 2 graphic with her backstory cause I know that a lot of people who read my reviews would've seen this anyway.) Okay so for our comparison Angela is the quiet loner girl from Sleepaway Camp (and the funny thing is what's ticking most of the campers off in the movie, was the fact that she was giving them the silent treatment (Now me and my friends Actually find that funny; because if they don't like her anyway.....why would they care if Angela WASN'T talking to them?) Now this movie actually has a pretty similar plotline (and now that I've seen Sleepaway Camp again......it makes a lot of sense....although the ending is still...strange. Okay you ready? Steady? Let's go....Angela has this weird aunt.....Her face is painted up like Baby Jane's...although they don't explain why. Now Angela is the 1st born.....son in the family.....I know it's weird. But this lady wanted a girl so she dressed her up as one (and because it's a movie she ended up being a girl.....with......Well most people know how the rest of that goes...and the ending cuts off, but I still REALLY like it......and although I never saw it; I know Angela comes back in the 3rd movie. Now with Cherry Falls you have Brittany Murphy (in my FAVORITE role she played) as The Scream Queen of the flick. And she is One tough chick. Now I do have one large qualms with the flick....I like that Jay Mohr is the killer (Not Laura Lee Sherman come back 25 years later in the flick like you think) as Brittanys half brother...but the back story DIDN'T have to be THAT graphic; I mean look at Scream 3......we know the killer was Sydney's half brother....but we didn't hear the whole backstory in the most Graphic Detail they COULD do, and I know this was a U.S.A. network slasher flick, but it's also a made for TV movie (you know before it went to DVD, and there's a point you know? I did like how after the crazed son was like Norman Bates, then killed off....Brittany still got to be with her guy Kenny ( cause these 2 are a good couple thru out the movie.) And everyone was able to put the past behind them.....And I think That's why for a few seconds Brittany sees the Real Laura Lee Sherman across the street watching her....and there's no sequal.....cause that ends the movies point. Now in Scream 3 Sydney's half brother is crazy....and she had to kill him stabbing him Right in the heart with his LETHAL hunting knife (and I always liked this.....it also goes with the blood promise Ginger and Bridgette made in Ginger Snaps) Because Sydney's eyes welled with tears.....she holds his bleeding hand tight (interlocking her fingers with his as she holds his hand until he died. And I liked that, because it means if the situation would've been different...then they could've actually had a nice family and a nice life together.",5,CLASS DISMISSED!,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,3568,"['Hey', 'Scream', 'Queen', 'here', 'friends', 'were', 'talking', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'extra', 'cause', 'Halloween', 'one', 'came', 'up', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'TV', 'last', 'summer', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'Dark', 'yes', 'then', 'write', 'lot', 'Dark', 'stories', 'too', 'Dark', 'Willow', 'such', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'say', ""n't"", 'Really', 'That', 'much', 'like', 'Scream', 'as', 'much', 'Scream', '3', '..and', 'movie', 'know', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'then', 'used', 'too', 'one', 'favorite', 'flicks', 'name', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'great', 'Original', 'girl', 'movie', 'one', 'name', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Sherman', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', '2', 'graphic', 'backstory', 'cause', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'reviews', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anyway', 'Okay', 'so', 'comparison', 'Angela', 'quiet', 'loner', 'girl', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'funny', 'thing', 'what', 'ticking', 'most', 'campers', 'off', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'giving', 'silent', 'treatment', 'Now', 'friends', 'Actually', 'find', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'anyway', 'would', 'care', 'Angela', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'talking', 'Now', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'similar', 'plotline', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'again', 'lot', 'sense', 'ending', 'still', 'strange', 'Okay', 'ready', 'Steady', 'Let', 'go', 'weird', 'aunt', '..Her', 'face', 'painted', 'up', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'Now', 'Angela', '1st', 'born', '..son', 'family', '..I', 'know', 'weird', 'lady', 'wanted', 'girl', 'dressed', 'up', 'one', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'girl', '..with', 'Well', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'rest', 'ending', 'cuts', 'still', 'REALLY', 'never', 'saw', 'know', 'Angela', 'back', '3rd', 'movie', 'Now', 'Cherry', 'Falls', 'have', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'FAVORITE', 'role', 'played', 'Scream', 'Queen', 'flick', 'One', 'tough', 'chick', 'Now', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'large', 'qualms', 'flick', '.I', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'killer', 'Not', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Sherman', 'come', 'back', '25', 'years', 'later', 'flick', 'think', 'Brittanys', 'half', 'brother', 'back', 'story', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'have', 'be', 'THAT', 'graphic', 'mean', 'look', 'Scream', '3', 'know', 'killer', 'was', 'Sydney', 'half', 'brother', '.but', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'whole', 'backstory', 'most', 'Graphic', 'Detail', 'COULD', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'U.S.A.', 'network', 'slasher', 'flick', 'also', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'know', 'went', 'DVD', 'point', 'know', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'crazed', 'son', 'was', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'then', 'killed', 'off', '.Brittany', 'still', 'got', 'be', 'guy', 'Kenny', 'cause', '2', 'are', 'good', 'couple', 'thru', 'movie', 'everyone', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'past', '..And', 'think', 'why', 'few', 'seconds', 'Brittany', 'Real', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Sherman', 'street', 'watching', '.and', 'sequal', '..cause', 'movies', 'point', 'Now', 'Scream', '3', 'Sydney', 'half', 'brother', 'crazy', '.and', 'had', 'kill', 'stabbing', 'Right', 'heart', 'LETHAL', 'hunting', 'knife', 'always', 'liked', '..it', 'also', 'blood', 'promise', 'Ginger', 'Bridgette', 'made', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'Sydney', 'eyes', 'welled', 'tears', '..she', 'bleeding', 'hand', 'tight', 'interlocking', 'fingers', 'hand', 'died', 'liked', 'situation', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'different', 'then', 'could', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'had', 'nice', 'family', 'nice', 'life', 'together']",Terror Tract VHS
568570,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0000560X2,Amy Lynn,"[4, 4]","This DVD contains 2 more obscure Horror Films that never made it to the theatre.Cherry Falls- starring Brittany Murphy & Jay MohrPlot- The town of Cherry Falls is shocked when a killer starts offing the teenage population, which happen to all be Virgins. When the students learn about the killers modus operandi, they throw a ''Pop Your Cherry Ball'' where the students can surrender their virginity. This movie is rare in the fact its usually the ones who are having the sex who are offed first, this time it's the virgins. This film was also recommended in Fangoria's '100 Horror Films youve never seen'. Overall, its a decent horror film with a different twist to it.Terror Tract- starring John RitterNow this one was suprisiningly unique. This is a Creepshow like film, except it dosent have the cartoons with the stories.Plot- A real estate agent is showing a couple around town who are looking to buy a home. Every home they go to seems to have some terrible murder that happened in it. John starts telling the creepy stories when he gets in the house and is showing them around.Story One 'First House'- About a couple having an affair and some crazy husband or lover who finds them together. They put him in the lake but he ends up coming back. And a twist at the end. Pretty good story but not as scary as the other 2.Story Two 'Second House'- Wow, this story was good and creepy, I sure wouldnt buy the house after hearing this one. Its about an evil monkey a little girl finds in her tree outside. Her dad lets her keep it in the house for a little bit but still has a feeling theres something wrong with the monkey when he starts biting him and throwing stuff at the dog. He finally gets fed up and wants the monkey out but the monkey wont leave and he starts trying all kinds of tricks to get him out, but the monkey keeps returning and the ending is brutal! This story makes me feel different about monkies now. Excellent story.Story Three 'Third House'-  This story is about a teenager whos having premonitions of a murderer on the loose and seeing pyschic visions of the killings. Hes worried the killer will strike again and is getting feelings so he goes to some therapist lady to tell her. This story would have been great as a whole film. The 'killer' in this film is so scary. Hes called ''granny'' and wears a granny mask that is one of the most frightening masks ive ever seen a killer wear. Whenever he kills he says ' Dont worry, its only Granny!!' then he kills them with an ax or a knife.  This one was great.Then the ending where Ritter has to make the sale of a home before the days up but the couple is so freaked out they dont want to buy a home now. The ending was a twist and it was funny at the same time.4 stars for Terror Tract, Highly Recommended.",4,"3 Stars for Cherry Falls, 4 for Terror Tract",1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2783,"['DVD', '2', 'more', 'obscure', 'Horror', 'Films', 'never', 'made', 'theatre.Cherry', 'Falls-', 'starring', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Jay', 'MohrPlot-', 'town', 'Cherry', 'Falls', 'shocked', 'when', 'killer', 'offing', 'teenage', 'population', 'happen', 'be', 'Virgins', 'When', 'students', 'learn', 'killers', 'modus', 'operandi', 'throw', 'Pop', 'Your', 'Cherry', 'Ball', 'where', 'students', 'can', 'surrender', 'virginity', 'movie', 'rare', 'fact', 'usually', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'who', 'are', 'offed', 'first', 'time', 'virgins', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'recommended', 'Fangoria', ""'100"", 'Horror', 'Films', 'youve', 'never', 'seen', 'Overall', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'different', 'twist', 'it.Terror', 'Tract-', 'starring', 'John', 'RitterNow', 'one', 'was', 'suprisiningly', 'unique', 'Creepshow', 'film', 'have', 'cartoons', 'stories.Plot-', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'showing', 'couple', 'town', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'buy', 'home', 'home', 'go', 'have', 'terrible', 'murder', 'happened', 'John', 'telling', 'creepy', 'stories', 'when', 'house', 'showing', 'around.Story', 'One', ""House'-"", 'couple', 'having', 'affair', 'crazy', 'husband', 'lover', 'who', 'together', 'put', 'lake', 'up', 'coming', 'back', 'twist', 'end', 'Pretty', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'other', '2.Story', 'Two', ""House'-"", 'Wow', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'creepy', 'sure', 'wouldnt', 'buy', 'house', 'hearing', 'one', 'evil', 'monkey', 'little', 'girl', 'finds', 'tree', 'outside', 'dad', 'keep', 'house', 'little', 'bit', 'still', 'feeling', 'something', 'wrong', 'monkey', 'when', 'biting', 'throwing', 'stuff', 'dog', 'finally', 'fed', 'up', 'monkey', 'out', 'monkey', 'wont', 'leave', 'trying', 'kinds', 'tricks', 'get', 'out', 'monkey', 'keeps', 'returning', 'ending', 'brutal', 'story', 'feel', 'different', 'monkies', 'now', 'Excellent', 'story.Story', 'Three', ""House'-"", 'story', 'teenager', 'whos', 'having', 'premonitions', 'murderer', 'loose', 'seeing', 'pyschic', 'visions', 'killings', 'Hes', 'worried', 'killer', 'will', 'strike', 'again', 'getting', 'feelings', 'so', 'therapist', 'lady', 'tell', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'whole', 'film', ""'killer"", 'film', 'so', 'scary', 'Hes', 'called', 'granny', 'granny', 'mask', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'masks', 'ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'killer', 'wear', 'Whenever', 'Dont', 'worry', 'only', 'Granny', 'then', 'ax', 'knife', 'one', 'was', 'great.Then', 'ending', 'where', 'Ritter', 'make', 'sale', 'home', 'days', 'up', 'couple', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'dont', 'want', 'buy', 'home', 'now', 'ending', 'was', 'twist', 'was', 'funny', 'same', 'time.4', 'stars', 'Terror', 'Tract', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",Terror Tract VHS

It was a funny movie no doubt but i'd like to see the full, gore intact version. However, I dont see many people wanting it.Terror Tract is a good movie.

I was very pleasantly surprised!I watched Terror Tract first, because I was sure it would be the more superfluous of the two movies (it's got John Ritter in it for God's sake).  But it actually turned out to be an anthology film (like Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt) with three very entertaining short stories interwoven by a disturbing wraparound sequence featuring Ritter trying to sell houses in a community that is not all that it appears to be.  Each story, including the wraparound-Ritter sequences, has a strong (sometimes familiar) story with a surprising, satisfying ending.  It's a fun movie...not really a fun as in ""comedy"", but it's a good, fun, vengeful-dead-husband-evil-monkey-psycho-granny-killer horror.Cherry Falls was also a real treat.  It's a straight horror movie that borrows from about every recent Scream-esque film out there, and then adds some surprising twists to keep it fresh.  There's no annoying fake ""jump"" scares (well, maybe one), the killer's motives actually make sense, and the whole movie has an air of paranoia about it.  It really keeps you guessing as the script is very solid and the acting is all-around excellent.Both movies are in anamorphic widescreen (with a surprisingly strong Dolby 2.0 audio track...the thunderstorm in the Terror Tract Evil-Monkey story sounds awesome) and are on the same side of the disc.

I think this was released in theaters (it has an MPAA rating), but it feels like a cable TV movie.  It's not BAD, but you've been down this road before.  Uneven style (hard to tell what is supposed to be funny and what is supposed to be scary).  Two stars for this title.Terror Tract, on the other hand, makes up for the weaknesses in Cherry Falls.  Although John Ritter is generally a turn-off to me in movies, his segues are brief and this film will suck you in and keep you (and I gotta admit, John Ritter as a cheesy real estate agent is perfect casting!).  More laugh-out-loud humor in this than Cherry Falls (which isn't much), but the stories are fairly interesting.  Reminded me of Creepshow from time to time.

568576,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B0000560X2,ChildInside,"[2, 3]","My God, this movie had it all!It had kick ass stories, kick ass characters, and hell, even a kick ass beginning! How many movies do you know had an exciting beginning? Well, this movie starts off with an incredibly cool scene involving a few animals eating each other viciously. You may think that is nothing special, but the gruesome way it is done will give you that special tingly feeling.You know, that feeling that says you're about to see something special. I will tell about the stories in the movie, but I won't mention the names.The first story in this movie entitled ""Nightmare"" involves a woman having an affair behind her husband's back. The husband knew about it and plotted their deaths. Well, everything failed and he ended up dying. Everything went downhill from there. The story is actually pretty good and the acting is not bad. It is VERY well presented and much much better than other stories of the same variant. We all know what kind of ghost story this is, don't we? It's the classic adultery situation where people die, then come back for revenge. However, the way the story is told here is INCREDIBLE! I love the great suspense! And I gotta tell you guys, this story has a unique twist! It's not innovative when you compare it to other movies, but I can tell you that you probably never saw the version of this story like this!The second story (Bobo) is about a father and his little girl. Naturally, he's wrapped around his daughter's finger and she daddy's little girl. One day, the little girl suddenly found a monkey in a red suit. She liked it and wanted to keep it. Being daddy's little girl, she gets what she wants. However, the father soon finds that he doesn't like the situation. Not only is his daughter suddenly liking him less and less, but there is something about the monkey that upsets him. The monkey seems to have a violent tendency and it also seems to have an adversion to him.This all swirls down to, obviously, obsession, and it was truly a beautiful sight. The ending is also unique, like the last story, but unfortunately, the last story's own twist dulled the twist in this story due to both of them being too similar. However, it is not similar in the way you might be thinking. Just watch and enjoy.The third story (Come To Granny) is, in my opinion, the best of all. They truly did save the best for last! Unlike the other stories, this one is not in the same veins. It is VERY dark, but not just in the nature of all the gore, but because of also the personality changes you see within the main character. His ""psychic powers"" seemed to be consuming him at a rate he couldn't heal back. As the story progresses, you just can't help, but become enthralled with him. What is upsetting him so much? Well, he had been having visions lately. Visions of a killer named ""The Granny Killer"" (due to his granny mask) killing all of his victims. Because of those visions, he has been losing everything. Now he comes to a psychiatrist to tell his story and as time go on, you can't help but get the feeling that the story is heading in a direction that you just want to know. This is truly the best out of all three not only because of its uniqueness, but also because the kid is a great actor. The ending is excellent, but unfortunately, you can't help but guess what will happen. I'm very willing to bet that you'll guess the wrong ending too, but I have been surprised before, so who knows? Maybe you'll find that you're surprised. Whichever way, you will like the ending!After all the stories are told, we are taken back to the realtor who's been telling the stories. It turns out there is an extra story to tell, but unfortunately, this is a pretty average one. You'll probably guess what will happen correctly. Still, it's an extra story, right? Now the realtor is a great actor, but the people looking to buy a house could probably be a little better. Otherwise, though, everything just screams ""classic campfire horror story"" at you. Everything goes crazy and I admit that it's somewhat corny, but you can't help but smile.Looking back on the movie, I can see why some people might not like this movie. However, I am a former ex-horror fan. I have seen so many horror movies that I'm pretty much de-sensitized to all the gore. The reason I'm an ex-horror fan? Because horror movies nowadays suck. The last horror movie I saw was Darkness Falls and that movie was so bad that I just stopped watching horror movies. I have had enough and the only reason I came upon this movie was because of a bargain. I must say that I'm glad I did get it because it is GREAT! It has a good plot, plausible characters, and SPECTACULAR music! At least rent this movie and enjoy it yourself sometime at night!",5,One of the better horror movies nowadays!,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,4742,"['God', 'movie', 'had', 'had', 'kick', 'ass', 'stories', 'kick', 'ass', 'characters', 'hell', 'even', 'kick', 'ass', 'beginning', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'know', 'had', 'exciting', 'beginning', 'Well', 'movie', 'off', 'incredibly', 'cool', 'scene', 'involving', 'few', 'animals', 'eating', 'other', 'viciously', 'may', 'think', 'nothing', 'special', 'gruesome', 'way', 'done', 'will', 'give', 'special', 'tingly', 'feeling.You', 'know', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'see', 'something', 'special', 'will', 'tell', 'stories', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'names.The', 'first', 'story', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Nightmare', 'woman', 'having', 'affair', 'husband', 'back', 'husband', 'knew', 'plotted', 'deaths', 'Well', 'everything', 'failed', 'ended', 'up', 'dying', 'Everything', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'VERY', 'well', 'presented', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'stories', 'same', 'variant', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'ghost', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'classic', 'adultery', 'situation', 'where', 'people', 'die', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'revenge', 'However', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'INCREDIBLE', 'love', 'great', 'suspense', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'guys', 'story', 'unique', 'twist', 'not', 'innovative', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'tell', 'probably', 'never', 'saw', 'version', 'story', 'second', 'story', 'Bobo', 'father', 'little', 'girl', 'Naturally', 'wrapped', 'daughter', 'finger', 'daddy', 'little', 'girl', 'One', 'day', 'little', 'girl', 'suddenly', 'found', 'monkey', 'red', 'suit', 'liked', 'wanted', 'keep', 'Being', 'daddy', 'little', 'girl', 'what', 'However', 'father', 'soon', ""n't"", 'like', 'situation', 'Not', 'only', 'daughter', 'suddenly', 'liking', 'less', 'less', 'something', 'monkey', 'monkey', 'have', 'violent', 'tendency', 'also', 'have', 'adversion', 'him.This', 'swirls', 'down', 'obviously', 'obsession', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'sight', 'ending', 'also', 'unique', 'last', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'last', 'story', 'own', 'twist', 'dulled', 'twist', 'story', 'due', 'being', 'too', 'similar', 'However', 'not', 'similar', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'Just', 'watch', 'enjoy.The', 'third', 'story', 'Come', 'Granny', 'opinion', 'best', 'truly', 'did', 'save', 'best', 'last', 'other', 'stories', 'one', 'not', 'same', 'veins', 'VERY', 'dark', 'not', 'just', 'nature', 'gore', 'also', 'personality', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'psychic', 'powers', 'seemed', 'be', 'consuming', 'rate', 'could', ""n't"", 'heal', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'enthralled', 'What', 'upsetting', 'so', 'much', 'Well', 'had', 'been', 'having', 'visions', 'lately', 'Visions', 'killer', 'named', 'Granny', 'Killer', 'due', 'granny', 'mask', 'killing', 'victims', 'visions', 'been', 'losing', 'everything', 'Now', 'psychiatrist', 'tell', 'story', 'time', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'feeling', 'story', 'heading', 'direction', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'truly', 'best', 'three', 'not', 'only', 'uniqueness', 'also', 'kid', 'great', 'actor', 'ending', 'excellent', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', ""'m"", 'very', 'willing', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'guess', 'wrong', 'ending', 'too', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'who', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'find', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'Whichever', 'way', 'will', 'like', 'ending', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'realtor', 'who', 'been', 'telling', 'stories', 'out', 'extra', 'story', 'tell', 'unfortunately', 'pretty', 'average', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'correctly', 'Still', 'extra', 'story', 'right', 'Now', 'realtor', 'great', 'actor', 'people', 'looking', 'buy', 'house', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'Otherwise', 'though', 'everything', 'just', 'screams', 'classic', 'campfire', 'horror', 'story', 'Everything', 'crazy', 'admit', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile.Looking', 'back', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'However', 'am', 'former', 'ex-horror', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'de-sensitized', 'gore', 'reason', ""'m"", 'ex-horror', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'suck', 'last', 'horror', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'stopped', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'only', 'reason', 'came', 'movie', 'was', 'bargain', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'get', 'GREAT', 'good', 'plot', 'plausible', 'characters', 'SPECTACULAR', 'music', 'least', 'rent', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'sometime', 'night']",Terror Tract VHS

A horror film that throws the rules completely out the window.  We need more scary movies like this.  Here's a quick synopsis:  A killer is stalking and killing the teenagers of Cherry Falls, Virginia.  The common link between them all?  They were all virgins.  The students of CFHS decide the only way to live to stay off the hit list is to lose their innocence.  Cool notion, huh?  The performances were great.  Brittany Murphy was awesome in this completely underrated role.  Michael Biehn (&quot;The Terminator,&quot; TV's &quot;Adeventure, Inc.&quot;), as the town sheriff, gave a convincing performance of a good guy trying to right a wronged past.  Candy Clark (&quot;American Graffiti&quot;) does a good turn as Brittany Murphy's mom.  For those of you who like trivia, look for Jesse Bradford (&quot;Swimfan&quot;) and Clementine Ford (Cybill Shepherd's daughter, &quot;Bring It On&quot;).  They have small parts.

568579,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B0000560X2,Endless Kitchen,"[0, 0]","""Terror Tract"" is a horror anthology film which begins with a seemingly friendly but desperate real estate salesman named Bob Carter (played by John Ritter) attempting to persuade a young couple(portrayed by Allison Smith and David DeLuise) to buy one of the three houses he shows them. Carter becomes more and more nervous as he receives threatening calls from his mysterious, darkly voiced boss. As he tours the houses with the couple, he tells what happened to the previous owners; each one died horrifically.The first of the three stories told in hindsight revolves around an unfaithful wife (Rachel York) who conspires to kill her husband but she constantly has nightmares involving his undead body returning. The plot and whole is-it-a-nightmare-or-not shtick is tiresome and predictable. This portion of the film is the most forgettable part.The film improves with the next story, which features an honest father (Bryan Cranston) who appeases his spoiled daughter by allowing her to keep a monkey that appears in the backyard as a pet. Things turn ugly as the monkey appears to have a grudge against the father and violent tendencies. The house and the neighborhood descend into chaos in this bloody tale of madness. This story is more Twilight Zone than horror but it is fairly well done.The final story is the best. It centers around a troubled teenager who claims he has premonitions in his sleep of the upcoming murders of a serial killer known as ""Granny."" He tells his skeptical therapist (Brenda Strong) and attempts to stop this murderer but is he psychic or the insane killer himself? This is a really intriguing, even thrilling slasher story with a few turns and reversal of fortunes. The serial killer is tall, wears a creepy old lady mask and refers to himself as ""Granny"" in a raspy voice. This segment might be nightmare fuel for some but it was, at the very least, a well done slasher story. In fact, this segment probably would have made a good slasher film by itself.The film concludes with the resolution of the pushy Mr. Carter; it ends both comically and violently. Ritter provides a good comedic relief. This is an entertaining movie, much like three and a halfTales from the Cryptepisodes melted into one another. Some of the stories are really good, the production values and special effects are great and the acting is solid throughout.

I never really got his style of comedy, although I understood the appeal.  What movies he's been in that I can remember were as bizarre and genre-bending as this anthology of ""horror.""  Along with Ritter are such famous faces as That Federal Agent Who Dies Right Away In The TV ShowLost,  The Dad FromMalcolm in the MiddleandBreaking Bad(I think his name is Bryan Cranston), and The Woman FromSeinfeldWho Never Wore A Bra.  Sorry.  I just didn't think the movie was great enough to warrant that much background research.The three tales all (kinda) center around a different house that Ritter (as a real estate agent) is showing to a newly married young couple.  Each house corresponds to a different tale of terror, one of them involving a jilted husband, another a jilted monkey, and the third an inexplicably psychic teen who has a direct line to a serial killer.  The connecting moments with Ritter's character wrap up with an equal amount of horror, a grotesque little tip of the cap that actually surpasses any of the three, unimpressive segments that came before it.Not bad, and not so good.  You'd spend just as much time and be even more entertained if you just watched an episode of each of the TV shows listed above.  Although, you may not be quite as horrified.

The DVD I bought doesn't have Terror Tract on it, so I can't comment on that. I dunno why I keep watching &quot;teen flicks&quot;, although so far, I enjoyed most of them. This wasn't one of my faves though. Too predictable, and I had a list of who I thought was the killer - and the person who was the killer was on the list. Normally I'm hopeless at guessing who the killers are. I wasn't keen on this film, mainly cos it was too much like Scream, I Know What You Did, etc. There wasn't enough suspense, or anything making me jump out my skin. And the director's different angle on the teen flick films - the victims are all virgins. Big wow! I'm safe :) The best bit was the last 15 minutes, and even that shocked me - an axe through the head, ouch!Brittany Murphy was very good in this film, played the part brilliantly, and she's not your average, blonde, big tits American high school lead in these films. Spookily, she reminds me of a younger Angelina Jolie! She's got the looks off to a T.Look for out the dad, played by Michael Biehn, who starred as the &quot;good guy&quot; in the first Terminator. Looks so different, but the eyes are the same.Watching the 10 minutes of extras, which weren't even that good, was a bit boring and the directors and everyone else, kept describing the film as &quot;humorous&quot;. Uh, I'm sorry, but where? Maybe I'm just too thick to notice the humour. It's a horror movie, I'm not exactly looking for humour in it :)I wouldn't say I would watch this film again. Maybe again sometime.
