And Monica Lewinsky, to the extent she was political. Other than that, the jokes are pretty much as relevant today as they were in 2000.The venue is a large auditorium in San Francisco, and is clearly uncensored. He's free to do jokes about sexy things and name the body parts involved. He's also free to talk smack back to the heckler who shouts ""Hey, Bill! Only Jesus saves!"" First he says that guy better leave before he gets to the Jesus part, then suggests that what he'd really like to do is gag him and tie him to his seat, forcing him to listen to his jokes about religion. Then he notices that the guy has left already.Bill argues that he likes Jesus, thinks he is cool, but can't stand religion. It's just that he says it so much better than I can. He also takes out after various differences between the sexes, including the problems caused by over-eager feminists. He talks about the drug war, and protecting the children from bad influences, and a host of topics where his primary theme is the hypocrisy of it all. His point about being more cynical is in reference to not believing the BS spooned up in commercials, whether for consumer products or for politicians. He talks about government regulations and bureaucracy, and declares he is a Libertarian, although not everything he says is consistent with the party platform.In short, he dishes up a great many laughs on a great many subjects, and the audience loves it.

Bush) but you may feel differently.As the program went on, I thought ""This man is clearly a Libertarian,"" a fact which he specifically affirmed later in the program.

Listen to Bill's observations about advertisement, drugs, republicans, death, religion (how religions are manipulated by people and how faith in God doesn't necessarily lead you to religion), aging (menopause = men on pause), the protected classes and their double standards (especially women), Barbie and Ken (Ken comes separately), and the male agenda ""men are as loyal as their options, women should stop complaining about men until they develop better taste in them....."".I especially enjoy how Bill reacts when some audience rudely interrupts him, I actually wish for that to happen. I just love how witty and ready Bill is; even Medusa might not keep up with him.When Maher refers to Clinton's levels of lies, it finally occurred to me why people like Maher don't choose politics; they simply can't lie.

880571,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007G89GY,Nicholas Carroll,"[45, 51]","I finally got to see Bill Maher on tour last year and it was two hours of very profound statements with a funny delivery. Him, along with Henry Rollins, are the masters of the spoken word. I can listen to both rant for hours on end about the state of our country. They are dead on accurate, with biting humor to boot!This DVD is from a show in San Francisco sometime in the summer of 2000. Although it doesn't give a date on the DVD, you know from Bill Maher that his comments are current, so if you're expecting to hear him speak about the war in Iraq or Abu Ghraib...those were things he discussed on his tour last year (which I hope will be released on DVD). On this DVD, he talks about his usual favorite subjects...drugs, the annoyance of children, complaints about women's dishonesty, defense of Clinton's affair with an intern, the idiocy of Bush and the Republican party, and his skewering of religious ideology. I particularly loved that this DVD included a reaction when some unseen audience member in the balcony yelled out to Bill that ""Jesus saves!"" His reaction and irreverent comments are downright funny and right on target! I loved how he compared unbelievable Bible stories that people believe literally happened with equivalent fairy tales that no one believes happened (he compared the apple from the forbidden tree in Genesis to the poison apple of ""Snow White"" and other similiar comparisons). To hear him say that does point out the obvious...why believe one but not the other? And what does believing in one but not the other have anything to do with how you treat people?Bill does claim to believe in God on this DVD, though I always had the impression that he was an atheist. He defends Jesus from the people who claim to be the most devout followers...Bill simply is a man who's too smart for his own good. I'm a Bill Maher fan...as his show ""Politically Incorrect"" was part of my TV diet during my college years. I don't agree with him on every topic (such as drugs), but I do think he's a smart man who does his homework and probably knows a lot more about the world than our current president. Bill Maher is someone who should be running our country right now! This DVD is for his fans out there.

Then there are some of his opinions that I couldn't disagree with more. Because I like him on the HBO show, I grabbed all of his stand-up acts to see what I'd missed out on, and I'm having a love/hate relationship with them. Sometimes they're really good, and other times they're really bad and repetitive. I'm completely bored with him doing skits about why drugs should be legal, about President Clinton getting head and why religion is stupid. I'm agnostic, but enough is enough. There's a difference between sharing a point and ridiculing others to the point of beating a BURIED dead horse. Talk about something else...please. His joke about men only being monogamous because of lack of women to have sex with was untrue. (I'm judging this from some very happily married men I'm related to or know well, who flat out just got tired of playing the field AND found a woman that they wanted to be with exclusively and forever.) It made me cringe because he sounded like the bitter girlfriend in the room who's mad she hasn't found someone to satisfy her. If Maher hasn't found a woman that makes him want to settle down, okay, fair enough, but assuming EVERY single guy in the world is not cheating because of lack of opportunity just sounds immature and hostile.",1,Hit or miss?
