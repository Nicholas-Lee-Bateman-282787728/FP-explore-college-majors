This one featured the talking pumpkin and not the magic mirror and is not as long.  It's ok but not as good as the first one.  As other people who have reviewed this vhs version have said, why Disney hasn't released both versions on DVD as most fans have requested or begged for, I have no idea.

I watched it every year on the Disney Channel with my family on Halloween until they stopped showing it (grrr!).  But there is one thing you all should know-  there are actually TWO versions of ""Disney's Halloween Treat"" that were made.  The one that was shown on TV was hosted by the Magic Mirror (which I believe is the best version), while the one that was released on VHS is hosted by a pumpkin and follows a completely different layout than the other version.  According to my dad, the pumpkin version was the original one that showed on TV first, but I don't remember it at all.  Both versions are good for a Halloween treat, but the Magic Mirror has more of a spooky feel to it.  If Disney ever releases this on DVD, they should release both versions on the same disc so the viewers can choose which one they can see, just for the sake of choices!But as to the show itself, it is a great compilation of scenes from ""Fantasia,"" ""Snow White,"" ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Peter Pan,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""The Sword in the Stone,"" and also short cartoons are put in the mix like ""The Old Mill"" and a few Donald Duck & Mickey Mouse cartoons.  I highly recommend this for the family, as it should become a tradition in everyone's home!",4,There is one thing you all should be aware of!,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,1257,"['love', 'show', 'watched', 'year', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'family', 'Halloween', 'stopped', 'showing', 'grrr', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'know-', 'are', 'actually', 'TWO', 'versions', 'Disney', 'Halloween', 'Treat', 'were', 'made', 'one', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'was', 'hosted', 'Magic', 'Mirror', 'believe', 'best', 'version', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'hosted', 'pumpkin', 'completely', 'different', 'layout', 'other', 'version', 'According', 'dad', 'pumpkin', 'version', 'was', 'original', 'one', 'showed', 'TV', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'versions', 'are', 'good', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'Magic', 'Mirror', 'more', 'spooky', 'feel', 'Disney', 'ever', 'DVD', 'should', 'release', 'versions', 'same', 'disc', 'viewers', 'can', 'choose', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'sake', 'choices', 'show', 'great', 'compilation', 'scenes', 'Fantasia', 'Snow', 'White', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Cinderella', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'also', 'short', 'cartoons', 'are', 'put', 'mix', 'Old', 'Mill', 'few', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'cartoons', 'highly', 'recommend', 'family', 'should', 'become', 'tradition', 'everyone', 'home']",N/A

Our version had a magic mirror as the host though - this one is the rumpled pumpkin.
