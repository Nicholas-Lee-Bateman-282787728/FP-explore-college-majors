Leave Religion Out, Keep Jesus in, stop the preaching. Mr. Tyler Perry I love your humility in loving Jesus, but at times, it robs from your messages on stage and can distort your script as being overly preachy. I love your work, I appreciate and respect your work. But sometimes, We want to hear your wisdom- Don't drown it out by being too overwhelming about your faith.Okay enough said!- ALL THE ACTORS WERE GREAT! All the songs were sung with such great power and force and deeply moving, All the life stories, Hopeful, sad, and inspiring. There is Hope in Mr. Perrys' heart. As a survivor of child abuse myself, Hope and faith is all we have left to heal the damage caused by abuse. I hope one day Mr. Perry you can include (male survivors) in one of your stories. Amazing.
