1298342,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B002XTBEDI,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","With lots of material left over from the original ""Cranford"", it was always a given that we'd get to see more delightful stories from the rural Cheshire village and it's endearing inhabitants.  These two 90-minute episodes finally tie up the stories of Miss Matty, Harry, Miss Galindo, Lady Ludlow and Cranford's irrepressible ""Amazons"" Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), and Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay).It's been a year since the events of the last series of ""Cranford"", and much has changed in the community.  Dr Harrison and Sophy have left the district, and so have Jessie and Major Gordon.  Widower Mr Buxton (Jonathan Pryce), an old resident of Cranford, returns with his now-grown son William (Tom Hiddleston) and spirited ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery).  On the other side of the social divide is the lovely Peggy Bell (Jodie Whittaker).  Cranford's newest romance has a lot riding against it, though, with Buxton very vocal in his displeasure at Peggy eventually becoming William's wife.  Mrs Jamieson's sister-in-law Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) is another enchanting newcomer.After closing down her enterprising parlour tea shop, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench) has settled into the joyful role of being a second mother to Tilly, the little daughter of Martha and Jem (Claudie Blakley and Andrew Buchan), whilst her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) provides the necessary money to keep the Jenkyns household going.  To her joy, Miss Matty once again has an extended visit from Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who reveals that she has firmly resolved to call an end to her engagement in order to set forth on a career as a novelist.At Hanbury Court, Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) is dying, but still firmly clinging to her land, which is constantly threatened by the ever-encroaching railway.  Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding) finally manages to secure Lady Ludlow's son Lord Septimus (Rory Kinnear) to return during a brief trip from his villa at Lake Lugano, but Lady Ludlow passes away before he arrives.  When Septimus unravels the bleak financial condition of the estate and realises that he'll have to eventually pay back Lady Ludlow's mortgage into the inheritance of young Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), he attempts to manipulate the boy into accepting a smaller immediate payment in lieu of the larger amount owed, underestimating the powerful ally that Harry has in Miss Galindo, and her fervent quest to see Mr Carter's last wishes carried out.The central dilemma in town remains the prospect of the railway ""invading"" the peace and calm of Cranford itself.  It's an argument which is pitting father against son, neighbour against neighbour, and driving away many valued workers, including Jem, who has become one of the local craftsmen drawn to the higher wages offered by the railroad company.  Despite her own fears and reservations, Miss Matty organises for her closest friends to experience rail travel first-hand, and unwittingly triggers a series of dramas with wide-reaching consequences for several Cranford residents...As in the original CRANFORD miniseries, there is much to love and savour in this all-too-brief sequel.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas is one of my personal favourites and she is a great practitioner in the art of how to write for period drama.  She has a particular knack for immersing herself in the period and creating a true dialogue, with great feeling and affection for her characters, and quite frequently hilarious.  I know of no other costume drama writer who can write such brilliant comedy - and with the antics of Miss Pole, Mrs Forrester and Mrs Jamieson, Heidi Thomas is in her element.The performances remain utterly delightful.  Only a top-drawer series like CRANFORD could attract the likes of Dame Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton, Julia McKenzie, Jonathan Pryce, Francesca Annis and Nicholas Le Prevost; in addition to bright young costume drama stars like Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") and Matthew McNulty (""Lark Rise to Candleford""). It's like a Theatre Rep company from the good old days.You'll never want to leave this town...",5,"more delights to be savoured in enchanting ""Cranford"" sequel",1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,4141,"['lots', 'material', 'left', 'original', 'Cranford', 'was', 'always', 'given', ""'d"", 'get', 'see', 'more', 'delightful', 'stories', 'rural', 'Cheshire', 'village', 'endearing', 'inhabitants', 'two', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'finally', 'tie', 'up', 'stories', 'Miss', 'Matty', 'Harry', 'Miss', 'Galindo', 'Lady', 'Ludlow', 'Cranford', 'irrepressible', 'Amazons', 'Miss', 'Pole', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Mrs', 'Forrester', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'Mrs', 'Jamieson', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'Miss', 'Tomkinson', 'Deborah', 'Findlay', '.It', 'been', 'year', 'events', 'last', 'series', 'Cranford', 'much', 'changed', 'community', 'Dr', 'Harrison', 'Sophy', 'have', 'left', 'district', 'so', 'have', 'Jessie', 'Major', 'Gordon', 'Widower', 'Mr', 'Buxton', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'old', 'resident', 'Cranford', 'now-grown', 'son', 'William', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'spirited', 'ward', 'Erminia', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'other', 'side', 'social', 'divide', 'lovely', 'Peggy', 'Bell', 'Jodie', 'Whittaker', 'Cranford', 'newest', 'romance', 'lot', 'riding', 'though', 'Buxton', 'very', 'vocal', 'displeasure', 'Peggy', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'William', 'wife', 'Mrs', 'Jamieson', 'sister-in-law', 'Lady', 'Glenmire', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'enchanting', 'newcomer.After', 'closing', 'down', 'enterprising', 'parlour', 'tea', 'shop', 'Miss', 'Matty', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'settled', 'joyful', 'role', 'being', 'second', 'mother', 'Tilly', 'little', 'daughter', 'Martha', 'Jem', 'Claudie', 'Blakley', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'whilst', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Nicholas', 'Le', 'Prevost', 'necessary', 'money', 'keep', 'Jenkyns', 'household', 'going', 'joy', 'Miss', 'Matty', 'once', 'again', 'extended', 'visit', 'Mary', 'Smith', 'Lisa', 'Dillon', 'who', 'firmly', 'resolved', 'call', 'end', 'engagement', 'order', 'set', 'forth', 'career', 'novelist.At', 'Hanbury', 'Court', 'Lady', 'Ludlow', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'dying', 'still', 'firmly', 'clinging', 'land', 'constantly', 'threatened', 'ever-encroaching', 'railway', 'Miss', 'Galindo', 'Emma', 'Fielding', 'finally', 'secure', 'Lady', 'Ludlow', 'son', 'Lord', 'Septimus', 'Rory', 'Kinnear', 'return', 'brief', 'trip', 'villa', 'Lake', 'Lugano', 'Lady', 'Ludlow', 'away', 'When', 'Septimus', 'bleak', 'financial', 'condition', 'estate', ""'ll"", 'have', 'eventually', 'pay', 'back', 'Lady', 'Ludlow', 'mortgage', 'inheritance', 'young', 'Harry', 'Gregson', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'manipulate', 'boy', 'accepting', 'smaller', 'immediate', 'payment', 'lieu', 'larger', 'amount', 'owed', 'underestimating', 'powerful', 'ally', 'Harry', 'Miss', 'Galindo', 'fervent', 'quest', 'see', 'Mr', 'Carter', 'last', 'wishes', 'carried', 'out.The', 'central', 'dilemma', 'town', 'prospect', 'railway', 'invading', 'peace', 'calm', 'Cranford', 'argument', 'pitting', 'father', 'son', 'neighbour', 'neighbour', 'driving', 'away', 'many', 'valued', 'workers', 'including', 'Jem', 'who', 'become', 'one', 'local', 'craftsmen', 'drawn', 'higher', 'wages', 'offered', 'railroad', 'company', 'own', 'fears', 'reservations', 'Miss', 'Matty', 'closest', 'friends', 'experience', 'rail', 'travel', 'first-hand', 'unwittingly', 'triggers', 'series', 'dramas', 'wide-reaching', 'consequences', 'several', 'Cranford', 'residents', 'original', 'CRANFORD', 'miniseries', 'much', 'love', 'savour', 'all-too-brief', 'sequel', 'Screenwriter', 'Heidi', 'Thomas', 'one', 'personal', 'favourites', 'great', 'practitioner', 'art', 'how', 'write', 'period', 'drama', 'particular', 'knack', 'immersing', 'period', 'creating', 'true', 'dialogue', 'great', 'feeling', 'affection', 'characters', 'quite', 'frequently', 'hilarious', 'know', 'other', 'costume', 'drama', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'write', 'such', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'antics', 'Miss', 'Pole', 'Mrs', 'Forrester', 'Mrs', 'Jamieson', 'Heidi', 'Thomas', 'element.The', 'performances', 'remain', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'Only', 'top-drawer', 'series', 'CRANFORD', 'could', 'attract', 'likes', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'Nicholas', 'Le', 'Prevost', 'addition', 'bright', 'young', 'costume', 'drama', 'stars', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Matthew', 'McNulty', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Theatre', 'Rep', 'company', 'good', 'old', 'days.You', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'leave', 'town']",Cranford: Return to Cranford

Hayes did an excellent job reviewing the general content of the film, I won't go over it again and I'm writing this review from the viewpoint that you, whom is reading this, have already seen the first Cranford.  This continuation does leave you wanting but not in a good way.  The film seems unfinished with a bunch of half attempts to cover potential plotholes (unless there is plan to make another continuation after ""Return to Cranford"" with further explanation as to what happens--if that's the case, I take back those last two sentences).While the original Cranford seemed to be light and fun, in spite of life's obvious tragedies, this film is far more dismal.  Some of the story, rather than building up anticipation for what's going to happen next seemed as if it were there as time filler.  Also there were way too many parts that were just plain cheesy.  Case in point, Mattie is awaiting her friends at the train station.  She has urged them to try out the train in view of the town's attempt at progression and modernization that has been a huge concern for our heroines.  No one has arrived.  The train pulls up and comes to a halt while smoke emerges from underneath the train and out of nowhere Matttie's four friends emerges from the smoke arm in arm.  LOL!What really saved Part 1 of this set is the appearance of Septimus, Lady Ludlow's long-awaited son, and his dealings with Harry Gregson, the beneficiary of Mr. Carter's estate.  Other than this, there's not much meat to the other storylines.  Of course, there is the inevitable love story (which is always a good thing) but still even that was predictable and not that all convincing.The beginning of Part 2 is much better with the discovery and agony of forbidden love affairs, a broken engagement, a defying of social expectations, and some of the fun gossipy deliciousness of the first Cranford but it starts get corny again towards the end.I hate somewhat comparing the two Cranfords but I'm sure that my being hopelessly prejudiced by the first (LOVED IT!!) dashed the high hopes to the second.

I must admit I was disappointed in Part One, which I watched on my local PBS station, WGBH-Boston, last Sunday night.  It felt contrived and flat, seemed poorly written, and was missing several pivotal actors.  Only the fine acting by Judi Dench and the comical Imelda Staunton redeemed this production.  Where were Dr. Harrison and his bride, Sophie Hutton (did they leave Cranford -- inpossible!), did Mrs. Rose marry the doctor and retire with him to some warm clime?, why did they have to kill off Martha (especially so soon), what about comical Caroline Tomkins and her new butcher husband, why did they replace Matty's dashing brother Peter with a far less attractive, eccentric actor (and weren't we left thinking at the end of the original Cranford that a romance might develop between Peter and Miss Pole? Instead he gives her a bird - huh?, leading to a slightly funny but kind of ridiculous ""cage"" scene), and I can't believe that Mary is engaged to a Mr. Turnbull (I thought she'd stay with Matty forever or at least for a few years since a year earlier, in the original Cranford, she denied any interest in marriage or babies).  It does seem natural for Jessie to have left for India with Major Gordon, but still I miss her (her sensitivity and emotional depth are features sadly lacking in this new production, at least Part One since I have yet to watch Part Two).  I guess I wanted everyone to pick up where they left off.  Because I am so curious about the missing characters, I really don't care about the new people -- although we heard so much about Septimus in the original Cranford that it makes sense he should arrive when Lady Ludlow dies.  Speaking of which, I didn't like that she died.  I wanted to see more of how the great Lady (and her views) changed with time and as a result of her relationship with Mr. Carter, now deceased, and Harry Gregson as he becomes educated and grows into a gentleman (and why didn't we see even one quick scene of his studies with the Reverend Hutton?).  The scene in which Lady Ludlow died was ridiculous -- sickly as she is, she stands for hours in one place and in a crooked posture waiting for her son's arrival and then all of a sudden falls to the floor dead.  Bottom line:  Part One at least just didn't work.  I had planned to watch Part Two tomorrow evening and then cancel my pre-order since the DVD wasn't scheduled for release until Tuesday.  But I got an e-mail that Amazon shipped it on Friday (and then promptly dropped the price by $.50).  Oh well, I'll put it in the drawer with the similarly disappointing sequel to the brilliant and entertaining 2002 Forsyte Saga.1/20/10 Update:  I watched Part Two of Return to Cranford this past Sunday night and thought it better than Part One.  Then, on Tuesday, the copy of Return to Cranford that I had pre-ordered arrived (and I was credited $.50).  I watched the series again over the past two evenings and I like it much better on second viewing, so I would increase my rating to 3.5 stars.  It's still not as good as the original, but well done nonetheless.

Not by trying to re-visit past triumphs, much as we long to do so. The proper successor to Cranford has yet to come along, in my opinion, and it probably won't be about Cranford, but ""Return to Cranford"" was great fun, nonetheless.Return to Cranford  stumbles perhaps against the block of the--what happens after the story ends?--mentality that plagues most sequels. We do get to see what happens to most of our beloved characters, with the notable exception of young Dr. Harrison. He's only mentioned in passing as having a wife and not being there anymore, which is odd, since so much of the drama revolved around him in Cranford. In the sequel, most of the drama revolves around the railroad construction, halted by Lady Ludlow's refusal to sell her land. Through a series of circumstances, the construction goes through an ""on-again, off-again"" cycle that feels contrived, and then culminates in an action-packed railroad event that also, in retrospect, feels contrived. Perhaps the writers hadn't come up with a solid character-driven story before they were up against a deadline. As a result we get this circumstance-driven drama that depends upon our pre-existing knowledge of and affection for the characters to get our attention. Had this story been about unknown characters, I doubt it would have much real interest at all.There is also a strange sense that Cranford is a set, rather than a town, in this sequel. It feels less populated, somehow, and the costumes and rooms less detailed.  Perhaps because of the way it was filmed? They must have reused the same costumes and sets as the original film, but this production does look subtly different. More like t.v. and less like cinema.Mattie's brother, Peter, is played by a different actor, which is distracting. There was something so remarkable, sort of ethereal, about the first Peter's physical appearance that it's dissapointing to see him played by this different actor.  The character adds very little to the story here, other than comic antics, so it's puzzling why Peter was included, if the original actor was apparently unavailable, especially since others are so pointedly missing. In fact, I wondered if the producers did a roll-call of who would be available for filming before the writers got to work on the screenplay, some of the omissions are so arbitrary.Lady Ludlow's son, the contemptible Septimus, appears onscreen finally and his story begins to develop, only to trail off. We never find out how his shenanigans turn out, despite the fact that they have a crucial bearing on the outcomes of several other characters.None of this means that I consider ""Return to Cranford"" a dismal failure. Not at all. For one thing, look at what it must be compared to. What sequel wouldn't suffer by comparison? I expected some notching-down of the quality when I ordered it, and intended to enjoy visiting with these characters again, anyway. And I did enjoy it. Although I have to say that, hokey a plot twist as it was, if Harry Gregson hadn't fogged up that mirror, I was prepared to be VERY dissapointed in the writers at that point! Enough bumping off of great characters, already!The actors, as always, were their superb selves.  The performances are as satisfying as they could be with that screenplay. Good enough, in fact, to distract from the lackluster story.If you're expecting to relive ""Cranford"" in all it's glory, don't. If you're prepared to enjoy some very fine t.v.-grade writing and production values, and revel in spending time with the beloved ""Cranford"" dames, then by all means, get yourself a copy of ""Return to Cranford"".

During the first viewing I was a little distracted by thinking about ""what happened to so and so?"" Also, the two new families are introduced a bit too quickly and so I didn't fully get into their characters until the second time around.  Like the first Cranford, this second installment has humor, sadness, the testing of friendships, the struggle between the old and the new and a sweet romance between two young people.  At first it bothered me that Dr. Harrison wasn't around, but then I thought about it.  How many period films continue a love story after the marriage?  Also, a huge part of the story in the first Cranford was the misunderstanding of Dr. Harrison's affections, so once that was resolved and he and Sophie were married, his story was told.  I really didn't see him being the heroic younger doctor again in Return to Cranford.  That was done enough in the first installment and it wouldn't have been as compelling in the second one.  In Return to Cranford, I absolutely loved the touching romance between William and Peggy.  He was so handsome, kind and resolved, and she showed that she was wise and strong in spite of her social awkwardness.  A few things keep me from giving this piece a 5 star review.  Perhaps I'll understand it better after more viewings, but I couldn't figure out exactly what happened with Harry and the estate.  Did he lose his inheritance?  I thought this story line was confusing and lacking in resolution.  Also, why was Mary gone in the beginning?  I didn't fully understand where she was and I thought it was strange to bring her back just to have her leave again.  Also, Mattie is almost financially destitute in the first Cranford, yet in this one, she has been able to save up a fairly large amount of money.  Is this because her brother Peter has his own income and contributes to her support?  I wasn't sure.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, feeling it to be overly sentimental.  It seemed odd to me that characters who probably wouldn't even know how to dance (specifically Peggy and Harry) were dancing like old pros.  In spite of these minor irritations, Return to Cranford is definitely a movie I will keep and watch several more times in the future.",4,A very good follow-up,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,2295,"['enjoyed', 'Return', 'Cranford', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'second', 'viewing', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'little', 'distracted', 'thinking', 'what', 'happened', 'so', 'so', 'Also', 'two', 'new', 'families', 'are', 'introduced', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'get', 'characters', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'first', 'Cranford', 'second', 'installment', 'humor', 'sadness', 'testing', 'friendships', 'struggle', 'old', 'new', 'sweet', 'romance', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'first', 'bothered', 'Dr.', 'Harrison', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'then', 'thought', 'How', 'many', 'period', 'films', 'continue', 'love', 'story', 'marriage', 'Also', 'huge', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'Cranford', 'was', 'misunderstanding', 'Dr.', 'Harrison', 'affections', 'so', 'once', 'was', 'resolved', 'Sophie', 'were', 'married', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'heroic', 'younger', 'doctor', 'again', 'Return', 'Cranford', 'was', 'done', 'enough', 'first', 'installment', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'compelling', 'second', 'one', 'Return', 'Cranford', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'touching', 'romance', 'William', 'Peggy', 'was', 'so', 'handsome', 'kind', 'resolved', 'showed', 'was', 'wise', 'strong', 'spite', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'few', 'things', 'keep', 'giving', 'piece', '5', 'star', 'review', 'Perhaps', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'better', 'more', 'viewings', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Harry', 'estate', 'Did', 'lose', 'inheritance', 'thought', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'confusing', 'lacking', 'resolution', 'Also', 'why', 'was', 'Mary', 'gone', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'where', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'strange', 'bring', 'back', 'just', 'have', 'leave', 'again', 'Also', 'Mattie', 'almost', 'financially', 'destitute', 'first', 'Cranford', 'yet', 'one', 'been', 'able', 'save', 'up', 'fairly', 'large', 'amount', 'money', 'brother', 'Peter', 'own', 'income', 'contributes', 'support', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'feeling', 'be', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'seemed', 'odd', 'characters', 'who', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'dance', 'specifically', 'Peggy', 'Harry', 'were', 'dancing', 'old', 'pros', 'spite', 'minor', 'irritations', 'Return', 'Cranford', 'definitely', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'watch', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'future']",Cranford: Return to Cranford

1298423,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B002XTBEDI,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","The first Cranford is a favorite in our home:  it has well drawn characters in deep and subtle situations that are fraught with emotion, with historical change, with personal development and hope.  It is one of the most beautiful mini-series I have ever seen, yet never gets precious or maudlin.  SO it was only a matter of time before we got this one.On the one hand, there are many  strengths to this production.  The characters develop, some in very surprising yet believable ways, including tragedies, changes in plans, and unexpected love.  This is very fun and makes it much more than a simple follow-on.  The period atmosphere is also elegant and plush, vividly and accurately evoking a period in history - my kids had many questions about it.  On the other hand, the story feels rushed.  Not only is there too much going on too fast, but the viewer lacks the time to integrate it all.  That translates into a kind of overload and a complete lack of the meditative, almost poetic, pauses and asides that makes the first production a meal to savor.As far as the plot goes, the train remains a controversial issue, with many complications and the need for continuing negotiations with owners and changes of attitude.  (This was one reason why train networks spread in the US much more swiftly.)  The son of the reigning aristocrat also returns too late, though after some brutal machinations he is whisked away all too quickly.  The wonderful boy who is charged with getting an education in order to create a school for the town also faces a significant and unexpected crisis.  Nonetheless, while most of the principal characters are there, the doctor no longer serves the town.  His loss is partially made up with a group of very good new characters, but again, it feels rushed.  One very interesting character is a Scottish aristocrat, who arrives in town to visit a relative - sparking a major fight - and astounds everyone with her decision to stay.  That is all I can say without giving away too much.I would recommend this to fans of the first series.  It is very good, if not as perfectly outstanding as we had hoped.",4,"more than a knockoff, but lacks the depth of the original series",1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,2129,"['first', 'Cranford', 'favorite', 'home', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'deep', 'subtle', 'situations', 'are', 'fraught', 'emotion', 'historical', 'change', 'personal', 'development', 'hope', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'mini-series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'yet', 'never', 'precious', 'maudlin', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'got', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'many', 'strengths', 'production', 'characters', 'develop', 'very', 'surprising', 'yet', 'believable', 'ways', 'including', 'tragedies', 'changes', 'plans', 'unexpected', 'love', 'very', 'fun', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'follow-on', 'period', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'elegant', 'plush', 'vividly', 'accurately', 'evoking', 'period', 'history', 'kids', 'had', 'many', 'questions', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'feels', 'rushed', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'too', 'fast', 'viewer', 'time', 'integrate', 'kind', 'overload', 'complete', 'lack', 'meditative', 'almost', 'poetic', 'pauses', 'asides', 'first', 'production', 'meal', 'savor.As', 'far', 'plot', 'train', 'controversial', 'issue', 'many', 'complications', 'need', 'continuing', 'negotiations', 'owners', 'changes', 'attitude', 'was', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'train', 'networks', 'spread', 'US', 'much', 'more', 'swiftly', 'son', 'reigning', 'aristocrat', 'also', 'too', 'late', 'brutal', 'machinations', 'whisked', 'away', 'too', 'quickly', 'wonderful', 'boy', 'who', 'charged', 'getting', 'education', 'order', 'create', 'school', 'town', 'also', 'significant', 'unexpected', 'crisis', 'Nonetheless', 'most', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'doctor', 'no', 'longer', 'town', 'loss', 'partially', 'made', 'up', 'group', 'very', 'good', 'new', 'characters', 'again', 'rushed', 'One', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Scottish', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'town', 'visit', 'relative', 'sparking', 'major', 'fight', 'everyone', 'decision', 'stay', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'first', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'perfectly', 'outstanding', 'had', 'hoped']",Cranford: Return to Cranford

And on that understanding, how one receives this sequel film is totally dependent on one's attitude towards the first. The original ""Cranford"" is a classic period English small town morality play. It is superbly performed by a galaxy of solid - even great - British actors who are all so relaxed and at home in their roles that it all seems totally real and convincing. Behaviour standards, class attitudes, subtleties of language depending who is addressing who, the sets, camera work and directing are all faultless. The transformation of Judy Dench, the awful impact of thoughtless gossip, the almost unbelievable naivete of some of the characters... it all adds up to a perfect little work of art. The sequel, Return to Cranford, is pretty well what you'd expect. The Dench character cannot transform again, the gossips are recognized and so you anticipate their effect, the hand is dealt from the same deck, but the trumps have already been played. In other words, it is much the same, but not quite as satisfying. There are a few new twists - nicely developed. The producers and screenplay writers work hard to get fresh dynamics into the mix, possible by the progress of the railway (approaching modernity and changing mores) and the actors all do as well as before although the stars from the first film seem at times just a little jaded, and it is possible to wonder why a few from the first weren't brought back - where did they go, and why? Having said that, note that I rated this with four stars - but I'd give the first film five.

Koblentz,"[11, 16]","Having loved CRANFORD, the original BBC series shown on Masterpiece Theatre, I placed my advance order for Return to Cranford with great expectations.  Unable to wait for the DVD to rlease I watch the two part series when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre, and found myself enjoying the first of its two parts and looking forward to the second and final installment, only to discover that it lacked everything that made the Cranford expirience what it was.Return to Cranford picks up a year after ""Cranford"" ends.  While the four women at the center of Cranford life remain, many of the other charecters have also gone including the village doctors, without any explaination.  Given how important it was for the village to have a doctor in the first series, and then to have the doctors absent without any explainations seemed odd. The cast is smaller and many of the charecters that drove the first series are gone, one would think that the actors have gone onto others things.  However in this series the town seems less full of English life, which is what made the original Cranford so glorious.The first of the two episodes is the better of the two.  One story line involves Lady Ludlow and her faith in her son who has failed her at every turn.  This thread seems to come off the best.  Another story line inolving actor Jonathan Price and his family - and a budding romance is keeps your interest, but it is a pale comparision to the romance in the previous episode as neither actors involved have any spark. This episode's finale has the women of Cranford doing what they do best, and perhaps they should have ended everything right here and left best alone.However in the second episode, while the town and the relationships of the people of Cranford are put to the test, the production falls completly apart.  Too many story lines are processed too quickly - including the introduction of a new charecter and a surprise wedding go full circle -  while the story of Harry and Lord Septimus is left unresoved as is the story line of Mary Smith who appears and then disappears.  In one scene, Dame Judy Dench goes to the Railway Camp in search of another charecter and she just seems very lost - and this becomes an untentional metaphore for the viewer, who is also lost in this scramble to tie up loose ends.  But it the quick cut to, and the chop, chop, chop pacing throws the whole production off kilter. And then, probably because they killed off people in one railway explosion in the first series, the producers thought a second railway explosion would be a nice way to get rid of a few problems.  But the explosion, and accident, and its aftermath is sloppily done.  The final event with no reason, is the return of Jem and Tillie - why?  Not that I'm complaining, but it just happens.This two part event just made me feel as if the producers had the best of intentions, but ran out of time and money.  And that is sad.

1298435,A4YF23EQV3ROV,B002XTBEDI,Slim Pickens,"[2, 3]","My wife and I really enjoy the first Cranford film/series.  It is truly excellent in pretty much every way.  Unfortunately, this effort is not nearly on par with the first.  The script, character development, story-telling, and pacing are lacking.  I think the film is still entertaining enough to be worth watching as long as you enter with lowered expectations.  In particular the actors do their best with what they are given.  The performances of Imelda Staunton and Judi Dench are worth seeing.  Other than that, where the original used the characters to good effect, this new series almost universally wastes them.Others have commented that the first part wasn't great.  It may not have been great, but still left the door open for a promising conclusion.

1298453,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002XTBEDI,Z Hayes,"[166, 174]","I was able to watch this follow-up toCranfordthanks to a particular website and I promptly pre-ordered the DVD as I loved ""Cranford"" and its host of interesting and eccentric characters (and yes, I am a period drama fan, especially of BBC productions). This is actually a 2-part special that is not only inspired by the original Cranford, but also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. ""The Moorland Cottage"", and also ""The Cage at Cranford"", seeThree Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton),  Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.The second part is set later in the year 1844, October  up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.The magic of the original is still evident and this follow-up (of sorts - it's not strictly a sequel though some story arcs from the first Cranford get developed here) is still charming and engrossing. A fair note of warning, this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization,etc., but there's also romance, lighthearted moments and even a bit of magic!The comic and the tragic are seamlessly blended into the story, resulting in an immensely satisfying viewing experience. I loved it though I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly.
