He picked up the signs very quickly--I would watch him practising them as he watched the dvd.  He loved being able to communicate with me. I think a younger baby would enjoy watching it, too, but would not be able to actually use the signs until they were a bit older.

989743,A3KTKOY77QGBC1,B000FGFURW,Melissa,"[2, 3]","As with the first signing DVD, (See my review of that one) this one continues on with introducing sign language to little ones. My son really enjoys it. Though, like I stated in the review of the other signing DVD, we do Signing Exact English (SEE), not the signs this DVD uses. So, sometimes, the signs are different for us. This can sometimes be confusing for my son, because he sees the people on TV doing one sign, and I'm trying to show him the ""right"" one as pertains to SEE.And also, one of the reviewers is right, a lot of these signs are a little complicated and not age appropriate. Some of the simpler signs should be explored. Ones that you use every day like food, water, drink, family names, stuff like that. Thank you for pointing that out. ;) I have a SEE book as well as a SEE CD rom, and if you check out [...], you can find those resources. I especially love the CD rom, because you can transcribe sentences and learn them easily. The book is great too! Very good dictionary.The one thing that still nags at me a little about these two Baby Einstein DVDs is that while they have a deaf person sign the words, I have yet to see a child with any kind of disability be featured on these DVDs, or any of them for that matter. It would be nice to see a child, like my son (who has hearing aids), demonstrate some of the signs. People with disabilities don't have to hide from society. They are a vital part of it, and are a great blessing to us all, no matter what handicap the world views them to have. We need to see these blessed people more often, so they can teach us all they have to offer! They are so pure of heart, and are the last people in the world that we should be ashamed of!While these minor comments of mine are valid ones, it still won't change the fact that these are still good DVDs worth getting. I hope they continue making the signing ones, especially, and that they will consider taking steps up in them.I'm glad they are doing these DVDs because signing is such a great way of communication. Children can learn to sign before they even speak, and it helps them to be less frustrated and better able to communicate what they want and need when they don't have verbal word power.I just hope more people see the benefit of sign, and go beyond the ""trendiness"" of it. I hope those that take interest and learn it will find it inspiring and fun, and continue to use it and be inspired by those who live with it and use it every day!Get these DVDs, as well as the entire Baby Einstein series. My son has benefitted so much from them!! Kids repeatedly watch things over and over, so why not have them watch something that will stimulate them and help them be smarter? That isn't an exaggeration either! My son never ceases to amaze me with his knowledge at the tender age of 3! He's known numbers and letters since 2-2 1/2 and it's in LARGE part to this video series, as well as their books and toys!",5,The Signing Continues!
