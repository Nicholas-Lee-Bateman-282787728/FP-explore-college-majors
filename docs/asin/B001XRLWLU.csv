At least they knew they were ending and didn't go out in an unresolved cliff hanger like NBC did with Las Vegas . Hopefully the dvd boxed set will have an alternate ending , since I'm definately buying it having missed the first 4 or 5 eps . The music is so old it shouldn't be a problem making it to the dvd , unlike season one of Life which NBC (AGAIN!) cheaped out on giving a crappy studio created soundtrack in place of it's great music by original artists ! Gritty realistic tv director/series creator David Milch (Deadwood, NYPD Blue,Hill Street Blues ) was working on a 1970s cop drama for HBO which was scrapped , I wonder if the cancellation of LOM had anything to do with it ?

But in my opinion here, there should have only been the BBC version of this show. Other than the music, I found nothing to keep me watching thsi version. I am not sorry that I bought it, I was curious about the show. I never knew that a remake was made.The BBC version actors were more in tune with the emotions that should have been played out in the American version but missed by a mile.Actor John Simm conveys the emotions that probably would have hit all of us were we suddenly back in 1970. I know that I would freak...The second season of the British version of ""Life on Mars"" comes out next week, I can't wait to get my copy.I would not say don't see this.

1245067,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B001XRLWLU,Claire,"[1, 1]","This show reminded me a lot of ""Twin Peaks"" not so much for the storyline but just the way it was a cool premise with interesting characters and a bizarre storyline with lots of funky plot twists but which was cancelled too soon and thus before it could really evolve into something substantial. The premise was interesting- Sam, a 2008 N.Y. cop, after being injured, wakes up in 1973 to find things are much different. Weird things happen to him while he tries to figure out what's going on. He also must now contend with crime as a police officer in a totally different decade. The characters are neat- Harvey Keitel and Michael Imperioli are both awesome as Sam's fellow cops. They bring so much to the show. Another good thing about the show is the music played in each episode. I may be mistaken but I believe all the original music from the show was left on the dvd so that is good. And since the creators knew the show was going to be cancelled, all the storylines are tied up so we are not left with a frustrating cliffhanger a la ""Twin Peaks."" Not much I can really say about this dvd. It was fun to watch the episodes- the clothes and music were great fun. However, it may seem pointless to some to buy or watch the eps since the show was discontinued.

1245068,A1W6YRU1O8581V,B001XRLWLU,"Cozyjo ""cozyjo""","[2, 2]","When the premise for this show was first introduced I was very excited and intrigued.  Afterall, I grew up in the 70's and have a very deep fondness for the music and that period of time.  1973 was a ""special"" year to me for personal reasons, and so the fact that Sam Tyler was transported back to that year made watching the show even more sentimental and special.  Add to it the wonderful characters, acting,  stories, music and commitment to the look and feel of the early 70's and this show was a winner hands down.  Yes, it still had to get its wings and find its way.  There was a bit of stumbling along ambiguity-wise (How much of it was about Sam trying to find his way back home vs. adjusting to his new life in 1973 vs. tackling yet another intriguing case that may have had a connection with why he was there in the first place?)  Perhaps it was ALL of these things..but in the end, it didn't matter.  What mattered was that with each episode the show proved it had heart.  It touched you on a level most shows don't dare do today.  In an age where we are inundated with reality tv drivel, humorless sitcoms and yet another forensic-themed crime drama, here was a show that gave us back-to-basics drama, not unlke the actual 70's shows of the time (like one of my favorites, ""Starsky & Hutch"").  That it takes place ""now"" in 2008/9 made it hip and fun to watch, imo.  It respected the 70's and what they represented without being TOO serious.  I could laugh in recognition and delight over the 70's references and even learn a thing or two I was too young to even know about at the time.That the series ended on such a bad note, is the only major flaw I see.  The ending was a huge disappointment and insult, imo..but other than that, if you ""forget"" the last five minutes of the finale, you'll see just how much potential this series had.  I only wish the network had seen fit to give this show a chance so that we could have delighted in many more years of this promsing series.

1245069,AHPCCRWNCD6Y7,B001XRLWLU,Cube,"[2, 2]","This show was outstanding.  I have not been so entertained by watching a TV show in many years.  The dialogue costumes, cars and especially the music all effectively added charm to this short lived series.  It features a time traveling cop searching for a way back to where he came from that blended science fiction, humor, and 70's culture into a unique mix.  This entertaining portrayal of early 70's insensitive, abusive, alcoholic NYC cops who in their own cynical way really cared was memorizing. The show often was very dark, as many cops show are.  As expected Harvey Keitel gave continuous outstanding performances. The script was very strong and I appreciated the rational philosophy about life that was incorporated into it.  Jason O'Mara did an excellent job along with the other members of the cast. The biggest question I have about this series how could it not have been a huge hit? This series was and is so much better then 99% of television shows out there today. I don't really watch television so much but I was glad to find this engaging show.

1245070,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001XRLWLU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[20, 20]","""Life on Mars"" made its debut in the US on October 2008 and was completed in April 2009.  The series is loosely based on the BAFTA-award winning series shown on BBC back in 2006-2007.The series revolves around a NYC homicide detective named Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara, ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Men In Trees"" and ""In Justice"") who is engaged to Detective Maya Daniels (Lisa Bonet, ""The Cosby Show"", ""A Different World"").  Both are planning to marry but first, they are on the pursuit of a man who is wanted for killing several women by torturing them within the 30 hours they are kidnapped and then killed.Unfortunately, due to circumstance, the person wanted is released but May suspects that he still is the person they are looking for and tails him.  It is realized later that the man they had in custody was the correct person (who has a twin brother) and when Sam goes to find Maya, all he finds is her shirt which has blood all over it.This leads Sam to pursuing the perpetrator but while going back to his car to get his radio, he is accidentally run over.  Next thing you know, Sam wakes up but he is in the wrong time period, waking up in 1973.  During this time, he's a police detective who has transferred to New York's 125th Detective Squad as a Detective Second Grade.  Before computers and modern technology, things are handled much differently during this time and it freaks Sam out, not knowing if he's dead or alive, if he's dreaming or going mad.  What is known is that cases that he is handling now, has to relate to his work in 2008 but most of all, things that deal personally with his life.But it's about Sam getting used to 1973 and his surroundings.  For Sam, being a part of the politically correct and modern technology-based era, preservation of suspects rights and forensic evidence is a priority.  Despite everyone are quite OK with how business is done at the 1-2-5, Sam believes in going by the book and being a respectable police officer and thus putting him at odds with the other detectives while winning the respect of the only person who will listen to him, Annie Norris.Joining Sam at the 1-2-5 squad in 1973 are:Lt. Gene Hunt (Harvey Keitel, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Bugsy"", ""Reservoir Dogs"") - The Commander of the 125th Detective Squad.  Brash, works with mobsters to get information, beats up the people they capture to get a confession and literally a corrupt cop but is dedicated to protecting the city.  He is often at odds with Sam's by-the-book attitude and ends up beating Sam up (or getting into fights with him).Detective Ray Carling (Michael Imperioli, ""Law & Order"", ""The Sopranos"") - A blunt detective who despises Sam for taking the position he wanted.  Short-tempered and arrogant.Annie Norris (Gretchen Mol, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Girls Club"", ""The Thirteenth Floor"") - A policewoman who has an undergraduate in psychology and a member of the Police Women's Bureau.  Since 1973 was during a time that female's weren't treated in the same capacity as men, she hopes that one day that female police officers will be as equals to men and that she will be a detective one day.  Often treated as someone with a lower status by the male detectives at 1-2-5, she listens to Sam (who babbles about being from the future) but respects him for having an open-mind, even though she doesn't quite believe his story.Detective Chris Skelton (Jonathan Murphy, ""October Road"", ""Wild Fire"") - The young detective trying to learn the ropes around the office.Throughout the series, Sam wonders if he is ever going to back to his time period, especially as he gradually starts to see some changes in the 1973 time line and trying to figure out if what is happening is real or unreal.  He realizes certain cases relate to his cases that he handled back in his time period.  But also throwing him for the loop is being around the time his mother was raising his younger version of himself and seeing his father and realizing more about his parents and their life back in 1974.""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" features 17 episodes on three discs.

While the first episode and flashbacks feature natural colors, it's when we see the 1973 scenes, a filter is used and the colors of the series become more amber with a yellow/orange/brown tinge and is purposely made to look different from the present-time scenes.  But by no means does the colors seem distracting.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  For the most part, the series is front and center channel driven with the dialogue and 70's music coming in nice and clear. Dialogue is understandable and there are sounds that utilize the surround channels.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" includes the following special features:DISC 1:* Audio Commentary for ""Out Here in the Fields"" with Executive Producers Josh Applebaum and Andre NemecDISC 2:* Audio Commentary for ""Things to Do in New York When You Think You're Dead"" with Jason O'Mara, Executive Producer Scott Rosenberg and Director/Co-Executive Producer Michael Katleman.* Audio Commentary for ""The Man Who Sold the World"" with Executive Producers Andre Nemec and Josh ApplebaumDISC 4:* Audio Commentary for ""Life is a Rock"" with Jason O'Mara, Executive Producers Josh Applebaum, Scott Rosenberg and Director/Co-Executive Producer Michael Katleman.* To Mars and Back - (15:35) Viewers journey to ""Mars"" with Sam Tyler the cast and producers to see where the ""Mars"" concept originated and if viewers can figure out where it's headed.

For the US version, the primary similarity is that Sam Tyler uses his 21st Century investigation skills in handling homicide cases and is a bit more politically correct than his 1-2-5 counterparts and his boss Gene Hunt is a crooked cop (although respectful to protecting the people of his city).But part of the problem was that ""Life on Mars"" was a series envisioned to lasting more than one season.  In fact, despite the series being critically acclaimed at the beginning, the series unfortunately had lower viewership.  It didn't help that ""Lost"", it's lead-in show was also battling with the loss of viewership as well.  So, major differences is that the character of Annie Hunt is portrayed much differently in the BBC version than the US.  Most importantly, the way the series ends for the BBC and US version differ greatly.  And part of the reason of how the season ended is due to the fact that the creators had such a short time of deciding how the series would end.In fact, fans of the series will probably enjoy the audio commentary for the final episode as we learn what the original finale was supposed to be but also the reason why they made the final minutes of the final episode as is.  But its also important to note that like the BBC version, the final second before the credits run in that final episode carries that same ambiguous feeling that perhaps things are not as they should be.With that being said, the series finale had an ending that is surely going to either be a love or hate moment for viewers.  I can't really spoil anything but needless to say, even the creators say in the commentary that the response was either love or hate, nothing in between.As for the series, I felt the writing was well done and the main talent such as Jason O'Mara, Gretchen Mol, Harvey Keitel, Michael Imperioli and Jonathan Murphy were a solid group.  O'Mara and Mol have great chemistry, Keitel is always a talented actor in playing the tough man role and Imperioli did a great job of playing the disgruntled detective.  Each of the talent did well in their roles and even for the short role of actress Lisa Bonet, it was great to see her again on television.The costume design is top notch.  The hairstyles, the clothing... I was quite surprised because there are a lot of extras featured in this series.  Since the shows take place in New York and Sam is wandering throughout the city, there are a lot of people in 70's outfits.  And it's not just the clothing but also the vehicles and the CG (as the Twin Towers are featured) to make the setting seem realistic.Also, another positive that I enjoyed about the series is the soundtrack used for each episode. ""Life on Mars"" would feature popular, classic rock or classic 70's music and for those who enjoy 70's music, would probably get a kick out of episodes where there is a police chase and then Mott the Hoople would be playing in the background.As for the DVD, we get four audio commentary tracks and a good number of special features.  A good number of content and for the most part, ""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" is a solid DVD release.Overall, ""Life on Mars"" was a series that was just so fun and enjoyable but it's so unfortunate that the series was canceled.  There was great potential in this series and the finale managed to end the series in an interesting note but it would have been interesting to see how the writers would have carried things off if they had that second season, more time and a few more episodes.Nevertheless, I felt that this was one of the more entertaining drama series on television and for those curious about the series or missed the series the first time around, ""Life on Mars - The Complete Series"" is definitely recommended!",5,"Highly entertaining!

I will say that the US twist ending was far superior to the UK, HOWEVER when the sequel series Ashes to Ashes came out the wrap up exceeded the US version.If presented with two choices in a TV show a US knock off or a UK original the UK version will almost always win out.In some ways it exceeded its originator from the UK (which, along with its sequel, Ashes to Ashes, was amazing in its own right  and the final divergent series ender was unique and brilliant, especially as it was cobbled together at the last moment to wrap up the too short lived series.I highly recommend this gem to anyone with half a brain. Then do yourself a favour and get the original BBC version, similar but different enough to be a separate treat. Sadly the Ashes to Ashes is only in region 2 DVD but a region DVD player is cheaply had via amazon.The one down side was that the US version was toned down. Glennis's Hunt was a misogynistic, bullying homophobic who you were a little frightened of if you against him and wanted him in your corner in a scrap. his Hunt was violent for a reason, Kietel was just a capricious bully randomly throwing a sucker punch and letting a few epithets fly, but he seemed to be more like a school boy swearing because teacher wasn't around. Glennister would have told the teacher to sod off. In a fight? Phil would take Harvey down.

Other cast members, especially Gretchen Mol as the sweet but principled Annie Norris (replacing the comely but overmatched Rachelle LeFevre of ""What About Brian"" and the ""Twilight"" movies) and star Jason O'Mara lent very strong performances throughout this series, although I remained indifferent toward Michael Imperioli's character Ray Carling as it wasn't far removed from his work on ""The Sopranos"", a subcultural touchstone I flat-out despise for its capricious, rationalized mayhem.....And while an avowed Anglophile (""Keen Eddie"", another short-lived entry - on FOX, is one of my ALL-time favorite shows) I was not similarly affected by the original British series in quite the same way - liked its ITC-inspired cheekiness, yes (shades of both Roger Moore's ""The Saint"" and Tony Curtis' ""The Persuaders"" - ironically, someone of whom Keitel reminds me a lot) but nobody - including its own residents - will ever mistake Manchester for 'the center of the universe'.....so many reviews of this American reimagining betray a typical English snootiness and there's NO reason why the 2 versions can't be appreciated for their respective charms.....The musical accompaniment (""Rocket Man"", ""All The Young Dudes"" and, of course, another obvious David Bowie chestnut, ""Life On Mars"", to name a few) is skillfully chosen and fits well within the scripted time spectrum.

This is a pale approximation despite following the British plots and even the dialogue with only revisions for American instead of British slang. Later shows go off on their own, developing their own style.None of the characters are developed to the degree that they were in the British series which may be as a result of American TV having more commercials and less running time for the actual show. Hence the different dynamics between the different characters is missing which gave the British series much more depth.Not bad, and better than much American TV, but it loses too much from the British version. Watch the British version, it has its flaws but is superior to this.The Second disc improves, greatly. One reason is that it strikes out on its own as far as plots are concerned. The American show is much more plot driven than the British version which is more character driven. The two shows wind up being two different cups of tea (or coffee).If one hasn't seen either of the shows, I'd recommend that the American series be watched first and the British series second.",3,"Watered down version of British Series, improves over time.",1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,1112,"['Saw', 'British', 'series', 'first', 'pale', 'approximation', 'following', 'British', 'plots', 'even', 'dialogue', 'only', 'revisions', 'American', 'instead', 'British', 'slang', 'Later', 'shows', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'developing', 'own', 'style.None', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'degree', 'were', 'British', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'American', 'TV', 'having', 'more', 'commercials', 'less', 'running', 'time', 'actual', 'show', 'Hence', 'different', 'dynamics', 'different', 'characters', 'missing', 'gave', 'British', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'depth.Not', 'bad', 'better', 'much', 'American', 'TV', 'too', 'much', 'British', 'version', 'Watch', 'British', 'version', 'flaws', 'superior', 'this.The', 'Second', 'disc', 'greatly', 'One', 'reason', 'out', 'own', 'as', 'far', 'plots', 'are', 'concerned', 'American', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'driven', 'British', 'version', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'two', 'shows', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'two', 'different', 'cups', 'tea', 'coffee', 'one', ""n't"", 'seen', 'shows', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'American', 'series', 'be', 'watched', 'first', 'British', 'series', 'second']",Life on Mars: The Complete Series

While working on one particularly tough case, Sam is hit by a car and wakes up to find himself in 1973.  He finds that he has just been transferred to a precinct in New York and finds himself working on a case that just might matter to his 2008 self.But Sam continues to find himself trapped in 1973.  His modern, politically correct ways are out of step with his new co-workers, especially in their attitude of Annie (Gretchen Mol), the lone female who wishes to be recognized as a real detective.  He finds his more modern methods occasionally help out with cases.  Then there are the cases that bring him into contact with his father, mother, and himself as a boy.All the while, Sam searches for a way to return home.  Will the weird clues he gets help?  Or is he stuck in 1973 for the rest of his life?I've never seen the BBC original version, but I got caught up in the hype that surrounded this show when it premiered last fall.  It took me a few episodes to fully get hooked, but when I did, I didn't want to miss an episode.  These characters all grew on you.  This included not only the two I mentioned, but Sam's fellow detectives Ray (Michael Imperioli) and Chris (Jonathan Murphy) and their lieutenant Gene Hunt (Harvey Keitel).  The differences in methods and the storylines brought in from that time period were fascinating.  And I kept trying to figure out what was happening to Sam.Of course, that also provides the biggest conflict over the show.  When ABC canceled the show, they allowed the producers to make one last episode to wrap everything up.  Fans seem to be pretty evenly divided over the ending.  Initially, I thought it was too far out in left field, but the more I have thought about it, the more I feel it does make sense.  There were clues given through the show that actually make it work.Even if you don't buy the ending, you can still enjoy the period piece, drama, and comedy of the show.  There are sixteen solid episodes before you get to the questionable finale.This show isn't for everyone (which is why the ratings tanked and it crashed).

1245095,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B001XRLWLU,M. Herzog,"[8, 9]","Now that I've rewatched Life On Mars, there's two things I'm certain of: (1) There were clues from the very first episode as to the ending, as well as other plot points throughout the season (which makes me love the show even more); and, (2) that I prefer this version to the British Version.  I know a bunch of people are going to attack me for this as the British is the original version, and this version borrowed a number of the early episodes from the British Show, but it won't change my mind.  The trouble I always had with the British Version was that it took itself too seriously.  This is a story that is based on a concept which is a little silly, and plays off the differences between being a person and police officer in the present time and the 70s.  As such, I prefer the lighter tone of the American version, which doesn't take itself too seriously, but still maintains enough of a level of seriousness not to be limited to a comedy.Beyond the debate over which version exists, this show stands on its own.  The lead is very good in this show, likeable, and gets a little bit of a confused puppy look whenever something happens that shouldn't (which happens all the time).  The rest of the cast is great, playing out the roles of the stereotypes of the time, be it the naive rookie, the hardened chief, the sexist detective, or the pre-feminist feminist.  While I'm sad the show only was on for a season, I'm glad it had one excellent season, where the mystery at least was allowed to be resolved.

My wife & I watched this short lived series on US tv and I got her the DVD for Christmas. (One of my best gifts ever, as she has watched it about 5 times already). Any who, the show orginated in the UK and was adapted for the US market. I've seen some of the UK series episodes and while well done, don't resonate with me as much because i grew up in the USA. This is a delightful drama/comedy from beginning to end. Poor ole NYPD Detective Sam Tyler gets hit by a car in 2008 & wakes up in 1973. He is being reassigned to another precinct, so when he arrives no one expects he is from the future. Sam doesn't even know what is going on. The plot is very fertile soil for jokes grounded in the juxtaposition of the time differential. (At various times, Sam asks for things which don't yet exist, e.g. DNA sample, Rape Kit, computer, which draws laughs from his 1973 co-workers). My two favorite moments are when he does the ""moon walk"" at a Christmas party and when he ask for a cell phone. Harvey Keitel (who as usual is perfectly cast), his Precinct boss, is incredulous. ""What's a cell phone"", he asks. Sam explains its a mobile telephone that you can carry with you. To which his boss replies, ""Who the hell would want to carry a 'phone around with them all day""? So...you generally get the picture. There are subplots invovling Sam's residual memories, and mysterious messages about how he can return to the future and insightful takes on how police work has changed as well as social norms, such as womens' limited career opportunities in the 70s. Finally of course, the big payoff is the last episode, where everything is explained. It's too good to give away. This series also has a great musical score that will put you right back in the 60s/70s groove. If you remember the 70s and have a shred of humor, you will love this show.

The idea of the series is that a person from the present day is sent back to the 70s. It is an exploration of how much society has changed in regard to issues around attitude around law enforcement, sexuality and the role of women. Most of the jokes are grounded in how outdated the attitudes are of the 70s.The key to the success of the British show was the role of Gene Hunt. Although the hero of the series is Sam Tyler who has travelled back in time, Gene is the section head of the police station he winds up in. In the American show the role is played by Harvey Keitel. In the British show the role is played by Phillip Glenister playing a once in a lifetime role.Glenister had such charisma and such a comic flair he was declared a British national hero. (Despite being a fictitious character) Two books have been released allegedly written by Glenister's character Hunt. Both have sold well.Harvey Keitel is clearly a great actor but he was not able to capture the magnetism of Glenister. In Glenister's hands Hunt is a person who frames suspects, beats up innocent people and has attitudes towards women out of the dark ages. However he is a person who has a love hate relationship with Sam Tyler and over time begins to accept the importance of such things as evidence in police investigations and that women can be successful police officers.The other issue with the American series is that it provides a more simple answer for how the time travel is possible and the underlying reality of what has happened. The British show has a darker vision.

So in that sense, it is art, imitating art, imitating life.Beyond the basic storyline of a 2008 detective finding himself in 1973, it is a sheer joy to watch the level of attention and detail that is lavished on the program. It isn't just the obvious things like clothing, cars, and music that gives LOM that 'Police Story'-like feel. It is also the cinematography, camera angles, action sequences, even how the credits are shown at the beginning of each episode - all done in meticulous 70s fashion.A number of reviews disparaged this US version as being inferior to the British version, as it had a completely different composition and end-story. I haven't seen the Brit version yet, but I think the American version of LOM stand well on it's own. The show made a pretty decent effort to depict the schism between the mindsets of the 1970s and the 2000s, while revealing tantalizing clues about the underlying mythos. The characters were absolutely wonderful. But while Jason O'Mara was a quite convincing lead, the scenes were invariably stolen by Harvey Keitel's and Michael Imperioli's characterizations of gritty NYC cops.And I don't think I can listen to David Bowie's 'Life on Mars?' again, without thinking about the scene in the first episode, where Tyler realizes where he is, when he turns and sees the World Trade Center towers looming over NYC once again. In fact, that scene really drove home how the NYC of 1973 is truly a bygone era.There is valid criticism that the final episode was anything from bad to atrocious. I suppose that while this is true, I think if the series had a chance to play out all of it's storylines, the endstory would have been more palatable. But because the network suits decided to pull the plug, the creators scrambled to bring closure. The rushed nature of the series finale clearly reflects this.As a final note, there is a lyric in the show's signature song, Bowie's 'Life on Mars?':""Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy. Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know. He is in the best selling show. Is there life on Mars?""How fitting.",5,"An excellent show, ended far too soon",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2743,"['Life', 'Mars', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'network', 'executives', 'will', 'kill', 'off', 'excellent', 'shows', 'yet', 'let', 'shlock', 'programs', 'keep', 'going', 'going.This', 'program', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'television', 'somewhat', 'following', 'wake', 'mysterious', 'serial', 'drama', 'genre', 'such', 'Lost', 'bunch', 'Lost', 'knockoffs', 'Surface', 'Invasion', 'were', 'not', 'notable', 'LOM', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'outright', 'quirkiness', 'devotion', 'genre', '1970s', 'cop', 'shows', 'fact', 'LOM', 'not', 'so', 'much', '1970s', 'even', ""'70s"", 'police', 'work', 'really', 'program', 'aspires', 'emulate', ""'70s"", 'police', 'television', 'shows', 'still', 'maintaining', 'own', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'So', 'sense', 'art', 'imitating', 'art', 'imitating', 'life.Beyond', 'basic', 'storyline', '2008', 'detective', 'finding', '1973', 'sheer', 'joy', 'watch', 'level', 'attention', 'detail', 'lavished', 'program', ""n't"", 'just', 'obvious', 'things', 'clothing', 'cars', 'music', 'LOM', ""'Police"", ""Story'-like"", 'feel', 'also', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'angles', 'action', 'sequences', 'even', 'how', 'credits', 'are', 'shown', 'beginning', 'episode', 'done', 'meticulous', '70s', 'fashion.A', 'number', 'reviews', 'disparaged', 'US', 'version', 'being', 'inferior', 'British', 'version', 'had', 'completely', 'different', 'composition', 'end-story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Brit', 'version', 'yet', 'think', 'American', 'version', 'LOM', 'stand', 'well', 'own', 'show', 'made', 'pretty', 'decent', 'effort', 'depict', 'schism', 'mindsets', '1970s', '2000s', 'revealing', 'tantalizing', 'clues', 'underlying', 'mythos', 'characters', 'were', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'was', 'quite', 'convincing', 'lead', 'scenes', 'were', 'invariably', 'stolen', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'characterizations', 'gritty', 'NYC', 'cops.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'listen', 'David', 'Bowie', ""'Life"", 'Mars', 'again', 'thinking', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'Tyler', 'where', 'when', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'towers', 'looming', 'NYC', 'once', 'again', 'fact', 'scene', 'really', 'drove', 'home', 'how', 'NYC', '1973', 'truly', 'bygone', 'valid', 'criticism', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'anything', 'bad', 'atrocious', 'suppose', 'true', 'think', 'series', 'had', 'chance', 'play', 'out', 'storylines', 'endstory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'palatable', 'network', 'suits', 'decided', 'pull', 'plug', 'creators', 'scrambled', 'bring', 'closure', 'rushed', 'nature', 'series', 'clearly', 'this.As', 'final', 'note', 'lyric', 'show', 'signature', 'song', 'Bowie', ""'Life"", 'Mars', 'Take', 'look', 'lawman', 'beating', 'up', 'wrong', 'guy', 'Oh', 'man', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'know', 'best', 'selling', 'show', 'there', 'life', 'Mars', 'How', 'fitting']",Life on Mars: The Complete Series

(That's a good way to find out whether or not you want to buy a particular item.) Well, let's just say that the show didn't exactly ring my bell. I will give the Sam Tyler character credit for one thing, though. He did NOT get all indignant at the people who were smoking - and inside, at that. Perhaps it would have been different if he had been a member of the LAPD, rather than the NYPD. Or maybe the writers thought that a scene showing Sam Tyler's shocked indignation at smoking would have been such an obvious cliche that they decided to avoid it.Whatever the finale of the series entails, it apparently has gotten people into such an uproar that I think I'll borrow that disc from the library - just to see the ending.LATER...Everything that I've ever read about writing spoke adamantly against this type of ending. The ending of the series was comparable to, and as bad as, a junior high school composition that ends, ""...and the little boy woke up!""While it was kind of ""cute"" having the President Obama of 2035 being one of the current president's daughters, it couldn't possibly happen for constitutional reasons.  In the year 2035, whoever is elected president had to have been elected in the year 2032, assuming that the elections continue to be held every four years.  President Barack Obama's oldest daughter, Malia, was born in 1998, which means that she would be 34 years old in 2032.  According to the constitution, one of the few qualifications that are explicitly stipulated is that the president (or the presidential candidate) must be at least 35 years old at the time of the election.  This applies to the vice-president, as well.  Therefore, Malia Obama could not even run for the office of president or vice-president in 2032.  She, of course, would be free to do so in the following election, the one in 2036.",2,"Typical Hollywood So-Called ""Creativity""",1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1939,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'nine', 'episodes', '2', 'discs', 'Life', 'Mars', 'borrowed', 'public', 'library', 'good', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'want', 'buy', 'particular', 'item', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ring', 'bell', 'will', 'give', 'Sam', 'Tyler', 'character', 'credit', 'one', 'thing', 'though', 'did', 'NOT', 'get', 'indignant', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'smoking', 'inside', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'had', 'been', 'member', 'LAPD', 'rather', 'NYPD', 'maybe', 'writers', 'thought', 'scene', 'showing', 'Sam', 'Tyler', 'shocked', 'indignation', 'smoking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'cliche', 'decided', 'avoid', 'it.Whatever', 'finale', 'series', 'apparently', 'gotten', 'people', 'such', 'uproar', 'think', ""'ll"", 'borrow', 'disc', 'library', 'just', 'see', 'ending.LATER', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'writing', 'spoke', 'adamantly', 'type', 'ending', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'comparable', 'as', 'bad', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'composition', 'little', 'boy', 'woke', 'up', 'was', 'kind', 'cute', 'having', 'President', 'Obama', '2035', 'being', 'one', 'current', 'president', 'daughters', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'happen', 'constitutional', 'reasons', 'year', '2035', 'whoever', 'elected', 'president', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'elected', 'year', '2032', 'assuming', 'elections', 'continue', 'be', 'held', 'four', 'years', 'President', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Malia', 'was', 'born', '1998', 'would', 'be', '34', 'years', 'old', '2032', 'According', 'constitution', 'one', 'few', 'qualifications', 'are', 'explicitly', 'stipulated', 'president', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'must', 'be', 'least', '35', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'election', 'vice-president', 'well', 'Therefore', 'Malia', 'Obama', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'run', 'office', 'president', 'vice-president', '2032', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'do', 'so', 'following', 'election', 'one', '2036']",Life on Mars: The Complete Series

Maybe there was a lack of oxygen that made the audience out there light headed and miss this unique show. Yes, it's a remake of a British TV series (which is also terrific)but it's not just the material (think of all those plays that are revived and done by different actors, directors and with different settings over the years)it's the performance of the material that matters. ""Life on Mars"" delivered Americanizing the original BBC TV series. The plots are roughly the same and the premise is EXACTLY the same. Detective Sam Tyler (Jason O'Mara) while hunting for a killer in 2008 that has kidnapped his partner gets hit by a car and wakes up in 1973. He has the same name, is still a detective but has been ""reassigned"" to the 125th Precint. His boss Gene (Harvey Keitel)pays lip service to Miranda and gets the job done. He knows the job that sometimes he has affiliations with seedy underworld characters (Robert Klein)and sometimes that means he roughs up the suspect but to him its all for the greater good. Forenics is primative at best but Tyler's unique mind means that he sees connections that aren't there allowing him to gain the grudging respect of his peers. Sam knows that he has to get back and he has to figure out what connection will take him back. He believes he's either 1) in a coma 2) in an alternate universe or 3)? but either way the challenge is for him to survive in this world as alien as the deserted landscape of the red planet.I'm surprised we don't have a Blu-ray of this. While the show looks quite good it was shot in high definition and would clearly benefit from a high def transfer. The show features a couple of commentary tracks one of which features executive producer Josh Applebaum discussing how they adapted the series for the U.S. audience and their take on how the show should develop, why they made the changes they did, etc.We also get a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes with the best being a tour of the sets by Jason O'Mara and 70's icon actor Lee Majors (""The Six Million Dollar Man""). The extras here are of a higher calibar when compared to those on the Acorn Media release of the original BBC series.Both the original BBC series and the U.S. series are terrific. Americans will be able to better relate to American Sam vs. British Sam because of the cultural touchstones but you can't go wrong with either one. Oh, and the conclusion of this series compared to the original British one is quite a bit different so be prepared for an interesting life on Mars.",4,Stranded in the alien landscape of New York in 1973...,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,2574,"['long', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'cards', 'Life', 'Mars', 'Maybe', 'was', 'lack', 'oxygen', 'made', 'audience', 'there', 'light', 'headed', 'miss', 'unique', 'show', 'Yes', 'remake', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'terrific', 'not', 'just', 'material', 'think', 'plays', 'are', 'revived', 'done', 'different', 'actors', 'directors', 'different', 'settings', 'years', 'performance', 'material', 'matters', 'Life', 'Mars', 'delivered', 'Americanizing', 'original', 'BBC', 'TV', 'series', 'plots', 'are', 'roughly', 'same', 'premise', 'EXACTLY', 'same', 'Detective', 'Sam', 'Tyler', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", 'hunting', 'killer', '2008', 'kidnapped', 'partner', 'hit', 'car', 'up', '1973', 'same', 'name', 'still', 'detective', 'been', 'reassigned', '125th', 'Precint', 'boss', 'Gene', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'lip', 'service', 'Miranda', 'job', 'done', 'job', 'sometimes', 'affiliations', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'up', 'suspect', 'greater', 'good', 'Forenics', 'primative', 'best', 'Tyler', 'unique', 'mind', 'connections', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'allowing', 'gain', 'grudging', 'respect', 'peers', 'Sam', 'get', 'back', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'connection', 'will', 'take', 'back', '1', 'coma', '2', 'alternate', 'universe', '3', 'way', 'challenge', 'survive', 'world', 'as', 'alien', 'deserted', 'landscape', 'red', 'planet.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'shot', 'high', 'definition', 'would', 'clearly', 'benefit', 'high', 'def', 'transfer', 'show', 'couple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'executive', 'producer', 'Josh', 'Applebaum', 'discussing', 'how', 'adapted', 'series', 'U.S.', 'audience', 'take', 'how', 'show', 'should', 'develop', 'why', 'made', 'changes', 'did', 'etc.We', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'best', 'being', 'tour', 'sets', 'Jason', ""O'Mara"", '70', 'icon', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'higher', 'calibar', 'when', 'compared', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'release', 'original', 'BBC', 'series.Both', 'original', 'BBC', 'series', 'U.S.', 'series', 'are', 'terrific', 'Americans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'better', 'relate', 'American', 'Sam', 'British', 'Sam', 'cultural', 'touchstones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one', 'Oh', 'conclusion', 'series', 'compared', 'original', 'British', 'one', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'interesting', 'life', 'Mars']",Life on Mars: The Complete Series
