But only he could make a film like this. Set and shot in Ho Chi Minh City, Cyclo is an unforgettable film. Visually, it is a  rich film, and contains just as much beauty as violence. This is a film  full of &quot;plastic&quot; colors and textures, and also flesh and earth  tones. It is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.  Although it tries to be apolitical, Cyclo still makes most viewers think  about what Vietnam is like, and what it means to them. In short, this film  succeeds where &quot;Kids,&quot; did not. It is a film about desperate  lives in a poor, hot city. However, it does not preach a specific message  to its audience. Cyclo really is a rich film about people drawn into  dangerous situations they cannot control, and somehow survive. It remains  one of the best films I've seen this decade.",4,An Extraordinary Motion Picture,915840000,"01 9, 1999",1999,933,"['Cyclo', 'masterpiece', 'Tran', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'neo-realist', 'style', 'result', 'French', 'film', 'education', 'only', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'Set', 'shot', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'City', 'Cyclo', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'Visually', 'rich', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'beauty', 'violence', 'film', 'full', 'quot', 'plastic', 'quot', 'colors', 'textures', 'also', 'flesh', 'earth', 'tones', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'be', 'apolitical', 'Cyclo', 'still', 'most', 'viewers', 'think', 'what', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'short', 'film', 'where', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'desperate', 'lives', 'poor', 'hot', 'city', 'However', 'not', 'preach', 'specific', 'message', 'audience', 'Cyclo', 'really', 'rich', 'film', 'people', 'drawn', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'somehow', 'survive', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decade']",N/A
184570,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1567301304,Brian E. Erland,"[8, 8]","Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.Far from the lush tropical family gardens present in 'The Scent of Green Papaya' and the majestic landscapes seen in 'The Vertical Ray of the Sun' Anh Hung Tran's second installment in this trilogy of films explores the seamy underbelly of urban Vietnam. Street gangs, prostitution and the endless pursuit of trying to survive for one more day is definitely a departure from his other two films.Young eighteen year old Cyclo works day and night as a bicycle taxi driver. When his cycle is stolen by a local street gang he  is unable to earn a living and is eventually forced against his will to become a criminal. Meanwhile his sister is also lead astray by the quietly charming 'Poet' who leads her into the world of prostitution. The families hopelessness and desperation grows as the story unfolds and one is left to wonder if those caught in such unfortunate circumstances have any hope at all of ever escaping a world of such immense corruption and greed.Anh Hung Tran's answer to this question is apparently found symbolically in the imagery of food, particularily fruit. In all three of Tran's films there is a scene of a mellon of some kind being meticulously cut open to reveal the moist, dormant seedlings slumbering within. I can only guess that such scenes are meant as a metaphor of new life and renewed hope always waiting to spring forth into the light of day and replace that which is forever passing away. While this may serve as an intriguing symbol to some, it hardly instills within the viewer much hope for the characters on the screen.The incredibly beautiful Tran Nu Yen-Khe once again plays one of the principal characters (Cyclo's sister), along with the talented and immensely popular Asian superstar Tony Leung (Poet) and Le Van Loc in the starring role as Cyclo. As always, Anh Hung Tran's visual artisty is second to none and Tran Nu Yen-Khe is an absolute delight to watch.",4,"""Nameless Is The River, Colorless Is The Flower""  ~  The Urban Jungle Of Saigon",1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1943,"['Note', 'Vietnamese', 'English', 'subtitles.Far', 'lush', 'tropical', 'family', 'gardens', 'present', ""'The"", 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya', 'majestic', 'landscapes', 'seen', ""'The"", 'Vertical', 'Ray', 'Sun', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'Tran', 'second', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'films', 'seamy', 'underbelly', 'urban', 'Vietnam', 'Street', 'gangs', 'prostitution', 'endless', 'pursuit', 'trying', 'survive', 'one', 'more', 'day', 'definitely', 'departure', 'other', 'two', 'films.Young', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'Cyclo', 'day', 'night', 'bicycle', 'taxi', 'driver', 'When', 'cycle', 'stolen', 'local', 'street', 'gang', 'unable', 'earn', 'living', 'eventually', 'forced', 'will', 'become', 'criminal', 'Meanwhile', 'sister', 'also', 'lead', 'astray', 'quietly', 'charming', 'who', 'world', 'prostitution', 'families', 'hopelessness', 'desperation', 'grows', 'story', 'unfolds', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'caught', 'such', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'have', 'hope', 'ever', 'escaping', 'world', 'such', 'immense', 'corruption', 'greed.Anh', 'Hung', 'Tran', 'answer', 'question', 'apparently', 'found', 'symbolically', 'imagery', 'food', 'particularily', 'fruit', 'three', 'Tran', 'films', 'scene', 'mellon', 'kind', 'being', 'meticulously', 'cut', 'open', 'reveal', 'moist', 'dormant', 'seedlings', 'slumbering', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'metaphor', 'new', 'life', 'renewed', 'hope', 'always', 'waiting', 'spring', 'forth', 'light', 'day', 'replace', 'forever', 'passing', 'away', 'may', 'serve', 'intriguing', 'symbol', 'hardly', 'viewer', 'much', 'hope', 'characters', 'screen.The', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Tran', 'Nu', 'Yen-Khe', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'principal', 'characters', 'Cyclo', 'sister', 'talented', 'immensely', 'popular', 'Asian', 'superstar', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Poet', 'Le', 'Van', 'Loc', 'starring', 'role', 'Cyclo', 'always', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'Tran', 'visual', 'artisty', 'second', 'none', 'Tran', 'Nu', 'Yen-Khe', 'absolute', 'delight', 'watch']",N/A
184571,A2AXP78ZZ42FVC,1567301304,"Charles Scott Bennett ""Mr. Bennett""","[34, 39]","This movie should come with a warning cause it's simply dynamite! However, it's not for beginners. If you want to see some romanticized view of exotic beauty in foreign lands, grab some wine and your honey, and see  Tran Ahn Hung's other movies, like &quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot;. That movie, although dealing with serious issues, is like 'Reality Lite'. You can ignore aspects of the human experience that plague the mind of your inner insomniac. But &quot;Cyclo&quot; is no joke! This here is some powerful stuff. Not for beginners, this! And, what could be better than Cyclo on DVD?! I can see my favorite parts anytime and instantly transport myself to my own private  VietNam. Cool.If you are familiar with popular cinema from Asia, you know the system's are not like American movies. Often certain popular actors are routinely coupled. I find this habit refreshing, especially here. In some ways, the more films you see the more shades there are to an actors ability in the big picture. On a small scale, the film makers bank on the public seeing more films since certain famous pairings generate the feeling that the actors are like your old friends. If you don't feel manipulated by this tactic, it can be the cinematic equivalent of a fun time at an amusement park, when you're with your way-out-of-town friends, always taking different rides.Furthermore, as far as East Asian Cinema goes, in my experience, as with all world cinema, you don't know what's it's all about until it's over. This film, like much of world cinema, is not trying to spoonfeed you. This movie gets 'heavy'. But if you stay with it, the whole of the film and the story within are very gratifying.As far as my criteria for a good flick goes, this one meets my standard for world cinema, and far surpasses American commercial films. The editing is seemless. The actors are fluid and charismatic as always (Remember, old friends are we). The cinematography is stunning. The script has a definite feeling of realism. These characters say what they really would say (and maintain appropriate silences too), not that I know what a struggling Vietnamese escort or cabbie would say. But, dig this, a good story like this feels real, draws you in, shows you things you never saw woven into a story that holds you 'til the credits, and stays with you after, spinning in your mind in true 'twist-a plot' fashion, ya? If you let yourself into the world of these characters, alternate possibilities will come to mind when it's through.Aside: Those of you who love Hong Kong film will enjoy seeing Tony Leung here - very believable and adorable! Secondly, and most important, DON'T EAT PORK BEFORE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! Nuff said.I won't ruin the story by divulging any specific special parts or attributes of the film.

184574,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,1567301304,Howard Schumann,"[7, 7]","In Vietnam, a cyclo is both the driver of a bicycle taxi and a name given to the taxi itself. In Tran Anh Hung's 1995 film Cyclo, the cyclo driver is a nave 18-year old (Le Van Loc) whose innocence is corrupted by the choices he is compelled to make to escape the circle of grinding poverty. Cyclo is far removed from the director's introspective and contemplative dramas (Scent of Green Papaya, Vertical Ray of the Sun) that preceded and followed it. In Cyclo, Tran assaults our senses with the churning swirl of colors and sounds of Ho Chi Minh City, capturing the vibrations of the city with its street markets, pavement cafes, sidewalk vendors, and choking traffic. He also shows the underbelly of the city: its violence, flesh for hire, and atmosphere of poverty, dirt, and decay. While the violence is graphic and unsettling, it is not exploitative and without the glamour associated with gangster films. Cyclo has little dialogue, mostly gestures and silences, and cinematographer Benoit Delhomme's focus on the underlying beauty of the city gives the film a lyricism that renders the violence ambiguous.Cyclo has lost both parents and lives in near poverty with his grandfather (Le Kinh Huy), who continues to work fixing bicycle tires despite his failing health. His younger sister (Phan Ngoc Lieu) earns a living by shining shoes outside of restaurants and the older sister (Tran Nu Yen-Khe) works as a cook and delivery person. Cyclo's father was also a pedicab driver but was killed when he was hit by a truck. Cyclo's boss (Nguyen Nhu) is known only as the Boss Lady (none of the characters in the film are named) who leads a criminal operation while taking care of her retarded son (Bjuhoang Huy). When Cyclo's bicycle is stolen by a rival gang, the young man is recruited by the Boss lady and her associate, The Poet (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), a small-time hoodlum and pimp, to work off his debt.The Poet is involved with robberies, sabotage, drug trafficking, and prostitution and is no stranger to homicide. He is strangely sympathetic to Cyclo, however, and seems to share with him the common longing for an absent father as revealed in the poetry he reads to him. Cyclo asks to join his gang but, in response, is forced to witness a mobster singing lullabies while he knifes a victim who is bound and gagged. Unknown to Cyclo, the Poet recruits his older sister into prostitution, making her available to men interested in various fetishes while preserving her virginity, presumably out of his own love for her. When her virginity is finally violated, The Poet tracks down and brutally murders the offending patron. Cyclo is forced to stay in an apartment away from his family and told to perform errands for the gang such as smuggling dope hidden in slaughtered cattle and throwing a gasoline firebomb into the building of the rival gang that stole his pedicab.Tran's vision is hallucinatory and unnerving and I often found myself unable to distinguish between what is real and what is a dream. The story is told from Cyclo's perspective and we enter his mind to witness his steady descent into confusion and fear, culminating in a memorable sequence where he combines pills and liquor and drenches himself in blue paint. Cyclo is disturbing and raw but it is an original work of art, both a brutal and often bizarre look at Saigon's mean streets, and a searing love poem to the city and a young man who finally steps outside the vicious circle to discover himself beyond the chaos.",5,A love poem to the city,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3498,"['Vietnam', 'cyclo', 'driver', 'bicycle', 'taxi', 'name', 'given', 'taxi', 'Tran', 'Anh', 'Hung', '1995', 'film', 'Cyclo', 'cyclo', 'driver', 'nave', '18-year', 'old', 'Le', 'Van', 'Loc', 'innocence', 'corrupted', 'choices', 'compelled', 'make', 'escape', 'circle', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'Cyclo', 'far', 'removed', 'director', 'introspective', 'contemplative', 'dramas', 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya', 'Vertical', 'Ray', 'Sun', 'preceded', 'followed', 'Cyclo', 'Tran', 'senses', 'churning', 'swirl', 'colors', 'sounds', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'City', 'capturing', 'vibrations', 'city', 'street', 'markets', 'pavement', 'cafes', 'sidewalk', 'vendors', 'choking', 'traffic', 'also', 'underbelly', 'city', 'violence', 'flesh', 'hire', 'atmosphere', 'poverty', 'dirt', 'decay', 'violence', 'graphic', 'unsettling', 'not', 'exploitative', 'glamour', 'associated', 'gangster', 'films', 'Cyclo', 'little', 'dialogue', 'mostly', 'gestures', 'silences', 'cinematographer', 'Benoit', 'Delhomme', 'focus', 'underlying', 'beauty', 'city', 'film', 'lyricism', 'violence', 'ambiguous.Cyclo', 'lost', 'parents', 'lives', 'near', 'poverty', 'grandfather', 'Le', 'Kinh', 'Huy', 'who', 'work', 'fixing', 'bicycle', 'tires', 'failing', 'health', 'younger', 'sister', 'Phan', 'Ngoc', 'Lieu', 'living', 'shining', 'shoes', 'restaurants', 'older', 'sister', 'Tran', 'Nu', 'Yen-Khe', 'cook', 'delivery', 'person', 'Cyclo', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'pedicab', 'driver', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'was', 'hit', 'truck', 'Cyclo', 'boss', 'Nguyen', 'Nhu', 'known', 'only', 'Boss', 'Lady', 'none', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'named', 'who', 'criminal', 'operation', 'taking', 'care', 'retarded', 'son', 'Bjuhoang', 'Huy', 'When', 'Cyclo', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'rival', 'gang', 'young', 'man', 'recruited', 'Boss', 'lady', 'associate', 'Poet', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu', 'Wai', 'small-time', 'hoodlum', 'pimp', 'work', 'off', 'debt.The', 'Poet', 'involved', 'robberies', 'sabotage', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'prostitution', 'stranger', 'homicide', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'Cyclo', 'however', 'share', 'common', 'longing', 'absent', 'father', 'revealed', 'poetry', 'Cyclo', 'join', 'gang', 'response', 'forced', 'witness', 'mobster', 'singing', 'lullabies', 'victim', 'who', 'bound', 'gagged', 'Cyclo', 'Poet', 'older', 'sister', 'prostitution', 'making', 'available', 'men', 'interested', 'various', 'fetishes', 'preserving', 'virginity', 'presumably', 'own', 'love', 'When', 'virginity', 'finally', 'violated', 'Poet', 'tracks', 'down', 'brutally', 'murders', 'offending', 'patron', 'Cyclo', 'forced', 'stay', 'apartment', 'away', 'family', 'told', 'perform', 'errands', 'gang', 'such', 'smuggling', 'dope', 'hidden', 'slaughtered', 'cattle', 'throwing', 'gasoline', 'firebomb', 'building', 'rival', 'gang', 'stole', 'pedicab.Tran', 'vision', 'hallucinatory', 'unnerving', 'often', 'found', 'unable', 'distinguish', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'dream', 'story', 'told', 'Cyclo', 'perspective', 'enter', 'mind', 'witness', 'steady', 'descent', 'confusion', 'fear', 'culminating', 'memorable', 'sequence', 'where', 'pills', 'liquor', 'drenches', 'blue', 'paint', 'Cyclo', 'disturbing', 'raw', 'original', 'work', 'art', 'brutal', 'often', 'bizarre', 'look', 'Saigon', 'mean', 'streets', 'searing', 'love', 'poem', 'city', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'steps', 'vicious', 'circle', 'discover', 'chaos']",N/A

Evil is all around him and he experiences nothing but unrelenting cruelty.  To top it off, the leader of the gang is renting out his sister to men with rather peculiar fetishes.The whole tone of the film is dark and depressing and I'm sorry I didn't turn it off but I kept waiting for something good to happen, some turn of events that would take this sad tale and change the mood.  That didn't happen though.  And even though a false somewhat happy ended was put on the conclusion, the film never had a single bright point that could lift the dark atmosphere.I feel the film was well done, but it was very confusing and the forced me to deal with some rather upsetting themes.  I certainly can't recommend it for the average viewer and think that even the most hardened film buff would find it just too depressing.",3,Well done but dark and depressing,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,1180,"['1995', 'Vietnamese', 'import', 'scary', 'Filmed', 'streets', 'Hanoi', 'story', '18-year', 'old', 'who', 'cyclo', 'living', 'picking', 'up', 'passengers', 'day', 'pedaling', 'city', 'Life', 'very', 'harsh', 'family', 'live', 'poverty', 'Then', 'world', 'control', 'when', 'cyclo', 'stolen', 'coerced', 'life', 'crime', 'Evil', 'nothing', 'unrelenting', 'cruelty', 'top', 'off', 'leader', 'gang', 'renting', 'out', 'sister', 'men', 'rather', 'peculiar', 'fetishes.The', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'dark', 'depressing', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'good', 'happen', 'turn', 'events', 'would', 'take', 'sad', 'tale', 'change', 'mood', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'even', 'false', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'ended', 'was', 'put', 'conclusion', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'single', 'bright', 'point', 'could', 'lift', 'dark', 'atmosphere.I', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'forced', 'deal', 'rather', 'upsetting', 'themes', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'average', 'viewer', 'think', 'even', 'most', 'hardened', 'film', 'buff', 'would', 'find', 'just', 'too', 'depressing']",N/A

There is a very dark side to Ho Chi Minh City because many people move there illegally (you need permission from the VN government) from rural areas to try to eek out a living. They are very poor and can be easily victimized because of their status. It is not a stretch to believe that some poor cyclo driver could end up like the young man in this movie. Cyclo drivers are usually extremely poor and often sleep overnight on their cyclo for two reasons. No place to go, and a need to protect what little livelyhood they have. Life on the mean streets of HCMC (and there are plenty really mean streets) is a real nightmare. Anyway, I found this movie to be in the same genre as Blue Velvet or Apocalypse Now as it goes from troubling in the beginning to a violent nightmare at the climax.

At first I thought it was a documentary of the horrificaly poor life of Vietnamese society. Little by little this mesmerizing story came to life. I was horrified, appalled, yet completely taken aback by this tale.This movie was so well acted that I really thought it was reality. Tony Leung is an awesome actor (also a hottie) who is sad and unhappy with his miserable existance of himself and those around him. Each character takes their own dark path in order to survive the harsh life they exist in.If you want a movie that is heartwrenching and will make you think alot about society and how lucky and unlucky circumstances of birth can be, then this movie is for you.

He appeared in Wong Kar-Wai's In the mood for love and Happy Together as well as Jackie Chan's popular film Gorgeous.  In this movie Leung plans an angst-ridden gangster, and he seems to have that silent angst-ridden look down pat. Playing opposite him is Tran Nu Yen Khe, a beautiful actress who also starred in Tran Anh Hung's Scent of the Green Papaya.Whereas Papaya was sensual and moody, Cyclo is gritty and more in your face. The main story is that of a Cyclo (a bicycle rickshaw taxi) that gets stolen and the cyclo driver must work for the gangsters to pay off the debt he has from when he borrowed money to get the cyclo.  When you get past the violent scenes (there is one torture scene that rivals the cop torture scene in Taratino's Reservoir Dogs) it is a captivating story.It is excellent on Video or on DVD - the zone-free DVD is available from Poker Industries which is an associated store of Amazon.com.",4,Take a ride on this dangerous Cyclo,1018396800,"04 10, 2002",2002,1018,"['Cyclo', 'Vietnamese', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu-wai', 'one', 'favourite', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'appeared', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'mood', 'love', 'Happy', 'Together', 'as', 'well', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'popular', 'film', 'Gorgeous', 'movie', 'Leung', 'angst-ridden', 'gangster', 'have', 'silent', 'angst-ridden', 'look', 'down', 'pat', 'Playing', 'opposite', 'Tran', 'Nu', 'Yen', 'Khe', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Tran', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya.Whereas', 'Papaya', 'was', 'sensual', 'moody', 'Cyclo', 'gritty', 'more', 'face', 'main', 'story', 'Cyclo', 'bicycle', 'rickshaw', 'taxi', 'stolen', 'cyclo', 'driver', 'must', 'work', 'gangsters', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'when', 'borrowed', 'money', 'get', 'cyclo', 'When', 'get', 'violent', 'scenes', 'one', 'torture', 'scene', 'cop', 'torture', 'scene', 'Taratino', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'captivating', 'story.It', 'excellent', 'Video', 'DVD', 'zone-free', 'DVD', 'available', 'Poker', 'Industries', 'associated', 'store', 'Amazon.com']",N/A

I mean I had heard good things about it, but the description seemed a little too much likeSalaam Bombay (Widescreen Special Edition). You got the innocent kid trying to get money to go back to his village. The older sister being led into prostitution and the pimp that is both a cause of grief and a product of his society. My girlfriend at the time didn't want to see it and usually I follow her lead in terms of dreary melodramas but for some reason we went.And it was like nothing we thought it'd be. For one thing, the pimp doesn't do much but smoke. Every scene he's in, he's smoking. Sometimes he's reciting poetry. In one scene he's obviously stabbed a guy, only you don't see the stabbing. You just see him hovering around the guy, smoking. I joked that Jet Li didn't do much inWar (Widescreen Edition)beyond ""Looking-Really-Cool-in-a-Suit-Fu"" but Tony Leung beats Jet Li hands down in that particular martial art. Then you got the prostitute. She's the luckiest prostitute in the world as almost all of her tricks are specialty tricks. One wants to paint her toenails. Another one watches her urinate.And then there's the kid. In Salaam Bombay, he's innocence personified. In this movie, he's creepy Damien Thorne kid. He's what Patton Oswalt wanted out of Anakin inStar Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)in that great comic bit ""I want to go back in time and smash George Lucas over the head with a shovel."" Sure, he's lost his cyclo and that's all sad, but he's also sniffing glue and painting himself blue. And when he finds the kid that stole his cyclo, it's not pretty.It's like the director saw Salaam Bombay and found the tedious melodrama part silly and decided to make a movie about pimps and prostitutes and children where they weren't one dimensional sermons about the big bad city. They aren't any more realistic but they are definitely much more interesting.All in all, a very creepy movie. The tag of ""innocence lost"" is a misnomer since there's really not much innocence involved in this movie (well maybe the pimp. He seems a trifle too starry eyed. He's even more sweet and goodly hearted than the pimp inHustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition).",4,"The Funny Side of Poverty, Despair, Prostitution and Creepy Little Kids",1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,2261,"['movie', 'was', 'playing', 'local', 'film', 'festival', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'mean', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'description', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'likeSalaam', 'Bombay', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'got', 'innocent', 'kid', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'go', 'back', 'village', 'older', 'sister', 'being', 'led', 'prostitution', 'pimp', 'cause', 'grief', 'product', 'society', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'usually', 'follow', 'lead', 'terms', 'dreary', 'melodramas', 'reason', 'went.And', 'was', 'nothing', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'pimp', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'smoke', 'scene', 'smoking', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'one', 'scene', 'obviously', 'stabbed', 'guy', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'stabbing', 'just', 'see', 'hovering', 'guy', 'smoking', 'joked', 'Jet', 'Li', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'inWar', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Looking-Really-Cool-in-a-Suit-Fu', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Jet', 'Li', 'down', 'particular', 'martial', 'art', 'Then', 'got', 'prostitute', 'luckiest', 'prostitute', 'world', 'almost', 'tricks', 'are', 'specialty', 'tricks', 'One', 'paint', 'toenails', 'one', 'urinate.And', 'then', 'kid', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'innocence', 'personified', 'movie', 'creepy', 'Damien', 'Thorne', 'kid', 'what', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'wanted', 'Anakin', 'inStar', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'great', 'comic', 'bit', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'smash', 'George', 'Lucas', 'head', 'shovel', 'Sure', 'lost', 'cyclo', 'sad', 'also', 'sniffing', 'glue', 'painting', 'blue', 'when', 'kid', 'stole', 'cyclo', 'not', 'pretty.It', 'director', 'saw', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'found', 'tedious', 'melodrama', 'part', 'silly', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'pimps', 'prostitutes', 'children', 'where', 'were', ""n't"", 'one', 'dimensional', 'sermons', 'big', 'bad', 'city', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'realistic', 'are', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.All', 'very', 'creepy', 'movie', 'tag', 'innocence', 'lost', 'misnomer', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'innocence', 'involved', 'movie', 'well', 'maybe', 'pimp', 'trifle', 'too', 'starry', 'eyed', 'even', 'more', 'sweet', 'goodly', 'hearted', 'pimp', 'inHustle', 'Flow', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",N/A
