There is no cinematic structure, no suspense, no atmosphere and no climax or any substance whatsoever.  This movie is a disgrace.  Simply ridiculous.  What were they trying to prove here anyway?  I think I spent 20 minutes of the movie watching a pink toaster in the movie that seemed like it would never go off the screen.  Obviously, the creators of this flick were going for the ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" angle with the live video footage, but they just did a terrible job of telling this story.  Unbelievably boring movie with pathetic acting makes for a watered down mess here.  I wish I could have liked it, but it was completely lacking in style and substance.  There just is not much to this movie that makes any sense.

It obviously has nothing at all to do with the first one, it's in a completely different sub-genre (the first was a slasher while this is a found footage film) Plus I strongly doubt anyone of the 15 people who had the supreme misfortune of seeing the first Knock Knock would ever want second helpings of that cinematic cesspool anyway.But I digress, this movie regardless of the title is utterly awful. Imagine ""Paranormal Activity"" made with a lot less money, few fewer scares (knock knock 2 has none whatsoever), worse actors, and a woefully unengaging storyline. Now this film is 5 times worse than whatever you've just thought of.

1546685,A3DMR234MWQYSE,B0085A9KT4,S. M. Barden,"[0, 1]","I was really prepared to like this movie.  I've enjoyed pretty much every ""found footage"" film I've seen, but this one breaks the streak big time.  Too bad - it had a great premise, the actors were likeable, and the initial set up seemed very well done.  But then... nothing.  No scares, no subtle use of psychology, just a haunted house movie without any convincing haunting.  Be aware that the kids only actually get into one house.  They spend a lot of time driving to other houses and standing on front lawns, but then only get inside the final one.  Someone mentioned a ""ghost"" special effect, but I sure didn't see it.  Nothing but screaming at things supposedly happening off camera.I don't need gore to enjoy a movie - Paranormal Activity kept me awake for a month listening to odd creaks in my house.  But this one takes the philosophy of ""what happens off screen is scarier than what happens on"" to reductio ad absurdum, by trying to scare us with essentially nothing at all.  Then the movie ends.  With another ten minutes of reshot and edited footage, this could be a very good movie, but as is it seems more like a semester project by a film student with no budget or imagination.BTW - if you're fighting for your life to get out of a house, are a couple of small pine 2x4's with a single layer of OSB going to slow you down for more than a minute?

I am not sure what this film has to do with the first one.Nothing says cheap like a 911 transcript, hand held cameras, and people screaming in the dark. Four young adults, whose acting careers were over before they started, decide to do their own Hollywood haunted tour, visiting famous locations of grizzly murders, suicides, and hauntings. Don't worry, if you were napping when they read about the Black Dahlia, they re-read it again and again. I did scream during the third reading, but not out of fright. Now this wouldn't make for too bad of a film in itself if they had more than $20 to spend on a script and special effects. Toss in a creepy GPS navigator that takes them to the haunted home, some red dyed Karo syrup, and a shower scene and you got yourself a classic.They eventually make it to a 1666 house and get locked in where it is deemed that bad acting and filming is a capital offense.

Not the least bit scary, not a single chill or thrill. I really think this movie was an exercise is boring the audience, which is easily the scariest aspect of the film. From the totally unwatchable ""couple"" at the beginning (one of those couples where you automatically think, really? she (beautiful) would be with him (i wont make personal insulting comments about physical appearance here, but you get my point) - not in this lifetime would they be a couple (thank you, lazy, near-sighted casting director). The interaction between them is painfully phony. OK, moving on... the rest of the movie is really much more as though someone left their camera on while recording a fairly routine day. seriously. that's it.OH, and lest I forget the WORST PART OF ALL - the cast literally READS 1/3 of the dialog from paper they printed out as part of the story. It's maddeningly painful to watch, unless you enjoy watching paint dry or grass grow.It's staggeringly shocking that anyone financed this project to completion and thought they might make a penny back.",1,Don't waste your time or money.,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,1181,"['Lem', 'keep', 'short', 'will', 'go', 'insane', 'boredom', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'going', 'Not', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'not', 'single', 'chill', 'thrill', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'exercise', 'boring', 'audience', 'easily', 'scariest', 'aspect', 'film', 'totally', 'unwatchable', 'couple', 'beginning', 'one', 'couples', 'where', 'automatically', 'think', 'really', 'beautiful', 'would', 'be', 'i', 'wont', 'make', 'personal', 'insulting', 'comments', 'physical', 'appearance', 'here', 'get', 'point', 'not', 'lifetime', 'would', 'be', 'couple', 'thank', 'lazy', 'near-sighted', 'casting', 'director', 'interaction', 'painfully', 'phony', 'OK', 'moving', 'rest', 'movie', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'someone', 'left', 'camera', 'recording', 'fairly', 'routine', 'day', 'seriously', 'it.OH', 'lest', 'forget', 'WORST', 'PART', 'OF', 'ALL', 'cast', 'literally', 'READS', '1/3', 'dialog', 'paper', 'printed', 'out', 'part', 'story', 'maddeningly', 'painful', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'grass', 'grow.It', 'staggeringly', 'shocking', 'anyone', 'financed', 'project', 'completion', 'thought', 'might', 'make', 'penny', 'back']",Knock Knock 2
