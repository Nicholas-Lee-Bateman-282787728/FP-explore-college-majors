416849,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6304366035,Alex Udvary,"[5, 18]","I've always been a very big David Lean fan. I think of him as the master of the epic. I enjoyed his early collaborations with Noel Coward and such films as ""Brief Encounter"" and ""In Which We Serve"" and I've also enjoyed his more celebrated titles; ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". But ""Ryan's Daughter"" is a mixed bag. Perhaps die-hard Lean fans will sing its praises but I want to remain unbiase. This is really a lesser effort from the great director.Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles in an Oscar nominated role) wants more out of life after getting married to a man she claims to love, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum) but does not know what. The town's priest, Father Collins (Trevor Howard) tells her besides the love of a good man, her health, and money there is nothing more to ask for in life. But Rosy won't hear of such nonsense! She knows that there must be something more to life than what she has.Charles is a schoolteacher who's wife has passed away. And at first did not want to get involved with Rosy. He is after all twice her age. He figured Rosy would end up with a man her own age but no. It was Rosy who went after him.The film takes place during the early 1900s as the beginnings of WW1 linger in the air. But here's where the fault on the film lies. In the first 40-45 minutes of the movie it's hard not to pay attention to all the long shots Lean uses as we get shots of characters walking alongside the beach, we see mountains and beautiful landscapes. My objection to all of this is for what purpose is it done? It seems Lean wants to impress us with background more than the story. In his other works, say ""Doctor Zhivago"" I never felt the background was a distraction, here though Lean seems to want to give the film that big epic feel but it doesn't work.The reason of this may very well be the content of the story. The movie is about a love affair Rosy has with a British officer, (Christopher Jones) after her marriage to Charles and the stir it causes within the town. This story is not strong enough to go on for 4 hours. Lean makes the mistake of not injecting enough of the historical setting to the film. He seems to interested in the landscape setting to pay attention to anything else.While most of the performances are quite good I found I grew to dislike Michael (John Mills), the town's simpleton. What is his purpose in the film? He only gives the film a certain level of comic relief, but it's not needed. And what about the way the town treats him? It almost downright brutal. But his presence just came to annoy me. How odd than to find he won the Academy Award that year for Best Supporting Actor. But honestly what does the Academy know? I don't even bother to watch them anymore.Still despite these imperfections ""Ryan's Daughter"" managed to hold my attention. The performances by Mitchum and Howard are entertaining even though the movie never really give us the opportunity to know these people. We never really know what exactly happened to Randolph Doryan, the young British soldier. We never really know why Rosy is attracted to him. We never really know why Charles married her in the first place. But I still think many should see this movie. I find it funny so many people think of ""Doctor Zhivago"" as a lesser film. That movie is a masterpiece one of the greatest epic romances of all time. It's ""Ryan's Daughter"" that is the lesser film.Bottom-line: Entertaining yet somehow disappointing David Lean film. The movie seems to try to hard to impress us with its landscape but doesn't make much use of the historical setting. Still the performances in the film are worthwhile and for that you should this movie.",3,Lesser David Lean Effort,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3698,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'very', 'big', 'David', 'Lean', 'fan', 'think', 'master', 'epic', 'enjoyed', 'early', 'collaborations', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'such', 'films', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'Which', 'Serve', ""'ve"", 'also', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'celebrated', 'titles', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Perhaps', 'die-hard', 'Lean', 'fans', 'will', 'sing', 'praises', 'want', 'remain', 'unbiase', 'really', 'lesser', 'effort', 'great', 'director.Rosy', 'Ryan', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'more', 'life', 'getting', 'married', 'man', 'love', 'Charles', 'Shaughnessy', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'town', 'priest', 'Father', 'Collins', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'love', 'good', 'man', 'health', 'money', 'nothing', 'more', 'ask', 'life', 'Rosy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'such', 'nonsense', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'Rosy', 'twice', 'age', 'figured', 'Rosy', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'man', 'own', 'age', 'was', 'Rosy', 'who', 'went', 'him.The', 'film', 'place', 'early', '1900s', 'beginnings', 'WW1', 'linger', 'air', 'here', 'where', 'fault', 'film', 'first', '40-45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'hard', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'long', 'shots', 'Lean', 'uses', 'get', 'shots', 'characters', 'walking', 'beach', 'see', 'mountains', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'objection', 'what', 'purpose', 'done', 'Lean', 'impress', 'background', 'more', 'story', 'other', 'works', 'say', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'never', 'felt', 'background', 'was', 'distraction', 'here', 'Lean', 'want', 'give', 'film', 'big', 'epic', 'feel', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'reason', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'content', 'story', 'movie', 'love', 'affair', 'Rosy', 'British', 'officer', 'Christopher', 'Jones', 'marriage', 'Charles', 'stir', 'town', 'story', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'go', '4', 'hours', 'Lean', 'mistake', 'not', 'injecting', 'enough', 'historical', 'setting', 'film', 'interested', 'landscape', 'setting', 'pay', 'attention', 'anything', 'else.While', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'found', 'grew', 'dislike', 'Michael', 'John', 'Mills', 'town', 'simpleton', 'What', 'purpose', 'film', 'only', 'film', 'certain', 'level', 'comic', 'relief', 'not', 'needed', 'what', 'way', 'town', 'almost', 'downright', 'brutal', 'presence', 'just', 'came', 'annoy', 'How', 'odd', 'find', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'year', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'honestly', 'what', 'Academy', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'watch', 'anymore.Still', 'imperfections', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'managed', 'hold', 'attention', 'performances', 'Mitchum', 'Howard', 'are', 'entertaining', 'even', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'give', 'opportunity', 'know', 'people', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Randolph', 'Doryan', 'young', 'British', 'soldier', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'Rosy', 'attracted', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'Charles', 'married', 'first', 'place', 'still', 'think', 'many', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'lesser', 'film', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'greatest', 'epic', 'romances', 'time', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'lesser', 'film.Bottom-line', 'Entertaining', 'yet', 'somehow', 'disappointing', 'David', 'Lean', 'film', 'movie', 'try', 'hard', 'impress', 'landscape', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'use', 'historical', 'setting', 'Still', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'should', 'movie']",N/A

416852,A3W38ZRBHIAW7O,6304366035,"Atticus Finch, Brooklyn","[7, 7]","""Ryan's Daughter"" was a unique David Lean offering, for it had no story prior to its original screenplay.  It does offer something that is quite different.  It is an epic that is really very small in scope.  Set against the Irish/British turbulence that exists even into today, the film tells the story of a very young woman who marries the wrong man (a schoolteacher played by Robert Mitchum, who lacks any real sexual awareness) and then falls in love with the wrong man (A British Sergeant who is stationed in her home town).  Ultimately she is found out and disgraced and she has no choice but to leave town.  Her father is an informer in the film, and John Mills (in an Oscar-winning performance) plays a mute, crippled human being who catches on all too soon to what Ryan's daughter is up to.  Sarah Miles deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance.  She is sensuous, young, forthright, fragile and ultimately heart-wrenching in her final scenes.  Robert Mitchum surprises in a very low-keyed role as her husband, and Christopher Jones is very fine as the soldier who has seen too much of war's devastation.  We witness it several times throughout the film.  Maurice Jarre's music is sensuos and then militaristic -- and all highly original.  Lean's palette is as beautiful as ever.  It is a long film, but one that I intend to re-view several times for its subtleties.  And just where is the DVD, MGM?

416854,ALR35EFI69S5R,6304366035,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[23, 24]","No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and, of course,  ""Ryan's Daughter""(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography in  all of Lean's films is always spectacular and breathtaking, for Lean had a  special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set  the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Lean characteristically  focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal  characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and  historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a  uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular  individual situation. Each of these films is also a well-choreographed and  photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the  geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are  always delighted by what Lean displays.Here both the Irish seascape as  well as the bucolic countryside underpin this classic tale of how different  life circumstances trap and constrain individuals, and how much each of us  are affected by the greater social surround in which we interact. Robert  Mitchum is cast against type, and does a marvelous job as an aging bachelor  who has caught the fancy of a young and extraordinarily beautiful student  who wants him to fulfill her youthful fantasies about all those adult  characters he taught so ably about in class. Of course, the young woman,  played ably by a young and gorgeous Sarah Miles, is bound for  disappointment and a rude awakening. Things are not always as much like  these literary descriptions as she had hoped.Into the picture comes an  attractive, dashing, and daring young English soldier, played by  Christopher Jones, who is immediately fatefully attracted to the young and  foolish woman, and eventually an affair begins. All of this is set in the  climate of both the Irish `troubles' and the threats associated with the  ongoing First World War in Europe, in which Ireland is anxiously  uninvolved.  As in all of the Lean movies, the ways in which each  character's nature, individual characteristics, and personal foibles  project themselves into the larger social circumstances provides the focus  of the unfolding story.  While the plot is nowhere near as memorable as in  some of Lean's other movies, the story is well told and is an interesting  and compelling look at small town life in an isolated and provincial Irish  village in the early years of the 20th century. I always enjoy watching it;  any David Lean film is a lovely experience that is an enchanting way to  while away a rainy Sunday afternoon.

416858,ATEDH3O9LN5AR,6304366035,Brian Walters,"[12, 13]","""Ryan's Daughter"" is one of the finest films in cinema history. It is the third and best of the great trilogy of films made by David Lean (director) Robert Bolt (screenwriter) and Maurice Jarre (music). The first two were ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"". The film is visually and emotionally as powerful as the wild scenery and weather of Ireland's west coast which feature so prominently. The story of a young woman's struggle to find something special in life, and her ostracism from her close knit community, set amidst the historical turmoil of the Irish rebellion of 1916, is utterly compelling. The performances of this glittering cast are breathtaking. John Mills (Michael - the village idiot) received a richly-deserved Academy Award for his role - in which he at no stage utters a word. Trevor Howard as the village priest contributes his finest ever performance. Leo McKern as Ryan plays a role with flamboyance and emotional complexity. Robert Mitchum as the cuckolded husband is brave, understated and exactly right. Sarah Miles, in the lead role, plays a character who is transformed by the experiences she undergoes. The film received poor critical reviews at the time of its release (from the same reviewers who had praised ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago""), although it did reasonably well at the box office. It is as if the reviewers didn't want David Lean to become too big a figure in the film world. Robert Bolt (his other credits include ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""The Mission"") demonstrates his talent as a screenwriter of powerful drama with this masterpiece.

There's not a subject that can't be picked by the absortion of it, since society v. the individual are depicted honestly and naturally.This is a great work, of the kind of masterpieces of other genres: painting (Irish west coast); literature (with the eternal characters that compound the human canvas, as in another Shakespeare plot); music (Maurice Jarre's score fits perfectly).But to me the most important thing about it is that, continually, the movie was reminding me of different scenes from the New Testament. So this is a 'real-as-life' movie. The Pharisees (politicians and their idolaters) one the one hand, and the individual or victim (Christ, the adulterous woman, the innocent child...) on the other.History repeats itself.

Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[13, 14]","I am happy ""Ryan's Daughter"" is coming out on DVD (finally!) and I agree with the other reviewers that it is one of Lean's masterpiece's of epic scope. But so far, all the accolades have been saved for ""Kwai,"" ""Lawrence"" (above all), and ""Zhivago."" Much less is said about ""A Passage to India,"" Master (Sir) Lean's consummate masterpiece, based on the E.M.Forster novel, perhaps because he made his own version of the story (changing beginning and ending). It is a movie where even the most minute character is developed, and a message for humanity (""only connect""), in ascending scale, is given in compelling dramatic fashion. I saw ""Ryan's Daughter"" when it came out in the big screen, and it is a dazzling romantic tragedy, fabulously photographed, and brilliantly acted. Can't wait to own the DVD and treasure it as I have all the other epics, five in all--the only epics, as a whole, that elevate the much-worn format in the 20th century. MY admiration increases every time I watch it, saying to myself what were those ""high-brow"" critics at the Algonquin Hotel, in New York, in 1970, thinking when the movie came out, making outrageous comments that the sensitive Lean took to heart and stayed away from moviemaking for fourteen year? Thanks to this edition, and the upcoming blu-ray, people at last can see it in all its magnificence. Encouraging to see all these comments from new and old viewers who feel as I do, and perhaps even higher, about this movie--which becomes better with time. Note on 9/20/2012: I have seen the DVD, many times, analyzed it, and written about it in great detail. My opinion of the movie stands, and I am happy to see that many reviewers before and after it have given it high marks. The admittedly slow-paced movie combines a perfectly structured plot, charactizations, expecially from the likes of Leo McKern, John Mills, who, as know, won an Oscar for his role as the mute lover of Rosie Ryan, Trevor Howard, who was nominated for an Oscar, and just about everyone in the village crowd. Despite his brawls with Lean, Robert Mitchum, playing against character, managed an almost perfect performance, first as the sexually limp husband, then rising to a giant on the screen in the final exit from the village mob; and even Christopher Jones has a stunning visual presence, though I wish they had allowed him to speak in his own voice, rather than in dubbed monosyllables. Sarah Miles could not have been more expressive of a woman wrapped in fantasy and then having a cruel awakening, after betraying both husband and lover. An intimate epic, with classic tragic contours, but also one of genuine spectacle in the storm sequences, unequalled since then, since no computer generated images can duplicate an actual filming of a natural event of such magnitude. This film offers many pleasures to the the cineaste, whether a university professor or ""man on the street,"" as Lean used to say. Add the vast landscape of western Ireland photographed by award-winning Freddie Young, and you have a stunning epic of drama, adventure, and a delicately woven plot. Modelled on Madame Bovary, by Flaubert, this is a woman's story, but no less that of a man, or men plus a crowd, maddened to a rage knowing this woman, Ryan's ""princess"" daughter, dared to dream of a flight to a world of freedom and romance, but paying for her dream at the end.

416866,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,6304366035,Dai-keag-ity,"[8, 10]","Often regarded as the masterful David Lean's ""least great"" film, this story of rural southwestern Ireland during the First World War is still an extremely beautiful exercise in film making. One of only two films in the last third of the twentieth century to be shot in 65 mm, a sort of cinematic precursor of today's high definition, Lean was on record in later years as saying this was the film he was both proudest of and also most frustrated by.Concentrating more on its stark but lush physical setting than its characters (sometimes focusing on setting to the detriment of its characters) Ryan's Daughter is a story about one Rosy Ryan, the pampered, pretty young daughter of a famous town publican, Tom Ryan, who marries a kindly but much older schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy, and soon comes to regret that she has. Bored with her limited wedded life, spoiled, always wishing for things she cannot have, the pretentious Rosy becomes infatuated with a melancholy young British military officer who has been sent to her desolate corner of Ireland after returning home from France wounded in the leg. The townspeople in the area are an aggressively closed-minded and xenophobic lot, virulently anti-British and pro-Republican, and Rosy, fool though she sometimes seems, is aware of what her fate would be should her involvement with the tragic-natured Englishman be revealed. What Rosy is unaware of is that her celebrated father, the town's leading man, is also a double agent who feeds information on Republican activities back to the British. A risky practice to say the least.Through it all the little town is kept under control by Father Collins, a stern presence in the community, feared, respected, deferred to by old and young. The phlegmatic Collins tries to direct Ryan's wayward daughter to be sensible in her life, but Rosy seems impelled toward behavior that can only bring ruin onto herself and those connected to her. Her recklessness makes Rosy far less a sympathetic person than an annoying one. She clearly and repeatedly places herself above others and accepts others' hardships as a small price for her own comfort. Her moment of possible redemption late in the film opens the door to hope for her, but the impression is that this is but a brief aberration in a deep-set egotism that is probably unshakable.This movie is famous for its scene filmed on a beach during an actual raging Atlantic gale, and even from the comfort of home to see multi-story waves break over and over amid furious winds makes you appreciate the commitment that went into making Ryan's Daughter what it was. All in all, however, Ryan's Daughter is not a great film. There is a paucity to its plot that deters its inclusion among the upper ranks of Lean's greatest works, and deep down the characters here breed their own destructions in ways that makes one feel their fates were warranted. The beauty of Ryan's Daughter is strictly visual rather than contemplative, and the truly best films of all time are those that brim with both.Four stars, but well worth seeing.",4,An Exercise In Visual Abundance At The Cost Of Depth,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,3068,"['Often', 'regarded', 'masterful', 'David', 'Lean', 'least', 'great', 'film', 'story', 'rural', 'southwestern', 'Ireland', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'still', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'exercise', 'film', 'making', 'One', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'last', 'third', 'twentieth', 'century', 'be', 'shot', '65', 'mm', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'precursor', 'today', 'high', 'definition', 'Lean', 'was', 'record', 'later', 'years', 'saying', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'proudest', 'also', 'most', 'frustrated', 'by.Concentrating', 'more', 'stark', 'lush', 'physical', 'setting', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'focusing', 'setting', 'detriment', 'characters', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'story', 'one', 'Rosy', 'Ryan', 'pampered', 'pretty', 'young', 'daughter', 'famous', 'town', 'publican', 'Tom', 'Ryan', 'who', 'kindly', 'much', 'older', 'schoolmaster', 'Charles', 'Shaughnessy', 'soon', 'regret', 'Bored', 'limited', 'wedded', 'life', 'spoiled', 'always', 'wishing', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'pretentious', 'Rosy', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'melancholy', 'young', 'British', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'desolate', 'corner', 'Ireland', 'returning', 'home', 'France', 'wounded', 'leg', 'townspeople', 'area', 'are', 'aggressively', 'closed-minded', 'xenophobic', 'lot', 'virulently', 'anti-British', 'pro-Republican', 'Rosy', 'fool', 'sometimes', 'aware', 'what', 'fate', 'would', 'be', 'should', 'involvement', 'tragic-natured', 'Englishman', 'be', 'revealed', 'What', 'Rosy', 'unaware', 'celebrated', 'father', 'town', 'leading', 'man', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'who', 'information', 'Republican', 'activities', 'back', 'British', 'risky', 'practice', 'say', 'least.Through', 'little', 'town', 'kept', 'control', 'Father', 'Collins', 'stern', 'presence', 'community', 'feared', 'respected', 'deferred', 'old', 'young', 'phlegmatic', 'Collins', 'tries', 'direct', 'Ryan', 'wayward', 'daughter', 'be', 'sensible', 'life', 'Rosy', 'impelled', 'behavior', 'can', 'only', 'bring', 'ruin', 'herself', 'connected', 'recklessness', 'Rosy', 'far', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'person', 'annoying', 'one', 'clearly', 'repeatedly', 'places', 'others', 'others', 'hardships', 'small', 'price', 'own', 'comfort', 'moment', 'possible', 'redemption', 'late', 'film', 'door', 'hope', 'impression', 'brief', 'aberration', 'deep-set', 'egotism', 'probably', 'unshakable.This', 'movie', 'famous', 'scene', 'filmed', 'beach', 'actual', 'raging', 'Atlantic', 'gale', 'even', 'comfort', 'home', 'see', 'multi-story', 'waves', 'break', 'furious', 'winds', 'appreciate', 'commitment', 'went', 'making', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'what', 'was', 'however', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'paucity', 'plot', 'inclusion', 'upper', 'ranks', 'Lean', 'greatest', 'works', 'deep', 'characters', 'here', 'breed', 'own', 'destructions', 'ways', 'one', 'feel', 'fates', 'were', 'warranted', 'beauty', 'Ryan', 'Daughter', 'strictly', 'visual', 'rather', 'contemplative', 'truly', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'are', 'brim', 'both.Four', 'stars', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

416869,AECVYXIL9791R,6304366035,David C. Read,"[6, 7]","Director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt are the same team that brought us Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago, so expectations prior to the release of this film must have been sky-high.  That being the case, I can understand why this film was panned by critics in 1970.  The pace is glacial.  At times, the film is so slow it seems to be going backward.  The film clocks in at 3 hours, 20 minutes, but the story could easily been told in under 2 hours, without sacrificing a single pertinent detail.  Easily.That being said, there are some wonderful performances here.  John Mills, who plays Michael, the village idiot, won an Oscar for his outstanding performance.  But the strongest performance was Trevor Howard's.  Howard plays the village priest, heroically trying to exert an uplifting influence on his parishoners, most of whom are barely smarter than Michael, and much more savage.  Robert Mitchum is cast very much against type; in most roles, he exudes casual but strong virility, yet in this role he is called upon to play a milquetoast aesthete who cannot sexually satisfy his young wife.  And he does an excellent job, nailing the Irish accent, to boot.The real star of the movie, however, is the beautiful west coast of Ireland, lovingly photographed.  This DVD looks absolutely gorgeous in an anamorphic widescreen 2-disk transfer.  The scenery alone is well worth the price of this DVD, even if you ignore the bloated, melodramatic plot.",4,Beautiful Irish coast is star of this over-blown melodrama,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,1461,"['Director', 'David', 'Lean', 'screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'are', 'same', 'team', 'brought', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'expectations', 'prior', 'release', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'sky-high', 'being', 'case', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', '1970', 'pace', 'glacial', 'times', 'film', 'so', 'slow', 'be', 'going', 'backward', 'film', 'clocks', '3', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'been', 'told', '2', 'hours', 'sacrificing', 'single', 'pertinent', 'detail', 'Easily.That', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'here', 'John', 'Mills', 'who', 'Michael', 'village', 'idiot', 'won', 'Oscar', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'strongest', 'performance', 'was', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Howard', 'village', 'priest', 'heroically', 'trying', 'exert', 'uplifting', 'influence', 'parishoners', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'barely', 'smarter', 'Michael', 'much', 'more', 'savage', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'cast', 'very', 'much', 'type', 'most', 'roles', 'casual', 'strong', 'virility', 'yet', 'role', 'called', 'play', 'milquetoast', 'aesthete', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'sexually', 'satisfy', 'young', 'wife', 'excellent', 'job', 'nailing', 'Irish', 'accent', 'boot.The', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'however', 'beautiful', 'west', 'coast', 'Ireland', 'lovingly', 'photographed', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '2-disk', 'transfer', 'scenery', 'alone', 'well', 'price', 'DVD', 'even', 'ignore', 'bloated', 'melodramatic', 'plot']",N/A

No, it is certainly not Quiet Man, and thank God for that.  The Ireland reflected in Ryan's Daughter is not your quaint, leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved by the world that doesn't know much about the real Ireland.  The atmosphere in this movie is haunting and disturbing and reflective of a great deal in Irish life, particularly at the time of the revolution against British rule.  The attitudes of the narrow-minded villagers was realistic and in line with the church-dominated lives they led, and the Irish are great begrudgers so their jealousy of the lovely daughter of the local publican is quite believable.  However, this story of a young woman married to a respectable and kindly older man but yearning for romantic love takes on a greater significance when it addresses the deeper issues involved: retribution, redemption, forgiveness, betrayal and loyalty.  The love scenes between Sara Miles and Christopher Jones, playing the shell-shocked British soldier who arouses the desire she has kept under wraps, are some of the most intense and moving I've seen.  When they become enmeshed in the village's suspicions, prejudices and hatred of the English, all set against the backdrop of the brooding and rather sinister Irish countryside, the tragedy is set in place.  This is a riveting film filled with outstanding performances, beautiful scenery and universal themes.  Robert Mitchum in particular is outstanding in what may have been his best ever performance, and one very much against type. And, of course, there is the ever-present star of the show, Ireland, the incredibly beautiful land of saints and scholars, informers and patriots, martyrs and conspirators.

416873,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304366035,Ed Uyeshima,"[16, 18]","It's no surprise to me that David Lean's penultimate film, 1970's ""Ryan's Daughter"", is the last of his epic films to receive the deluxe DVD treatment since it is likely the most maligned and misunderstood. However, the 2006 two-disc package really shows a genuinely affecting, WWI-era romantic melodrama set against the stormy western coast of Ireland. Calling it a sweeping epic does not really do justice to the splendid visuals that Lean and his favorite cameraman Freddie Young present here (Ireland's Dingle peninsula looks stunning), yet at its core is an intimate love triangle that raises the ire of the village given the political frictions between Britain and Ireland. It seems a shame that the film was so lambasted when it was released since expectations were set so high after Lean's previous three films, all three widescreen masterworks - 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", 1962's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and 1965's ""Doctor Zhivago"".Written by Robert Bolt (who also wrote ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago"") as a Celtic variation on Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"", the plot is focused on Rosy, the spoiled, headstrong daughter of Thomas Ryan, the local publican. She seeks a more cultured life and sets her sights on Charles Shaughnessy, the educated schoolmaster. Rosy makes the naive presumption that Charles' worldliness represents great passion but finds out otherwise on their wedding night. Enter Major Randolph Doryan, the young, shell-shocked British soldier assigned to take command of the local army detachment. Doryan and Rosy enter into a passionate affair, but it's a matter of time before Charles and the rest of the village find out. Meanwhile, a band of Irish rebels led by Tim O'Leary are intent on retrieving a shipment of German arms in order to take umbrage against the unwelcome British occupiers. The two plot strands merge, and tragic consequences ensue.There are certainly moments of excessive, florid abandon in the film, especially when Lean focuses on the illicit lovers. The director goes all out in making the lovemaking scenes between Rosy and Doryan combustible, first in the pub amid Doryan's traumatic flashbacks of exploding bombs and then in a lengthy and surprisingly carnal scene in a wooded enclave. Their mutual rapture is at turns moving and titillating. The other drawback is that unlike ""Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence"", Lean does not really integrate the political backdrop of the story fully into the triangle plot. Rather, he uses it more as a plot device to give the story a greater historical resonance. At the same time, some sequences highlight Lean's brilliance as a film auteur, for example, when Charles gradually discovers the reality of his wife's indiscretion on the beach or the aftermath of the town pillaging when Rosy is brutalized for her alleged role in helping the British. From a technical standpoint, Lean's pure cinematic mastery can be best seen in the storm sequence, when the town bands together to get the boxes of artillery. Maurice Jarre's music is memorable, as his haunting theme plays constantly throughout.The performances are variable, though all the key players provide strong moments. Sarah Miles handles the difficult role of Rosy with dexterity, especially as she runs the risk of alienating the viewer with her extramarital deception. In what has to be the most atypical role of his lengthy career, Robert Mitchum is a revelation as Charles. His natural tough-guy veneer has been completely subverted to play a passive, accepting man whose love for Rosy remains unsullied by the harsh reality of her adulterous behavior. It's a masterful performance because with a minimum of fuss, Mitchum taps into the depth of despair experienced by the cuckold husband. Looking pained and obviously cast for his James Dean-like demeanor and look, Christopher Jones portrays Doryan with brooding stares and a minimum of dialogue. Lean does what he can to camouflage Jones' comparatively stoic performance, but the result still provides a sagging imbalance to the love triangle. A heavily made up John Mills plays the mute gargoyle-like Michael as a series of tics and befuddled looks. Leo McKern effectively plays Ryan for the weak-willed hypocrite that his character is, and his emotional abandonment of his daughter is quite affecting. As Father Collins, Trevor Howard has a wild-eyed look about him at times, but he passionately provides the moral compass for the story.As the movie runs for three hours and fifteen minutes (actually shorter than ""Lawrence"" and the same as ""Zhivago""), the film is spread across two discs separated by an intermission. In fact, like any epic, there is orchestral music for the overture, intermission (which ends part 1), entr'acte (which begins part 2) and ending. The print quality is superior and the sound even better. The commentary track has several participants who take turns commenting on the scenes. DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau smartly introduces each speaker in order to avoid confusion, and the differing perspectives can be quite interesting. Disc 2 has a solid, hour-long 2006 documentary, ""The Making of Ryan's Daughter"" divided into three chapters, as well as a couple of production shorts made at the time of filming.",4,"Sweeping,

416878,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6304366035,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[9, 12]","This is Sir David Lean's most underrated film.  The critics trashed it when it was released, and the negative publicity made it a huge bomb.  Lean was so devastated that he didn't direct another film for 14 years.  As usual, critics have shown their ignorance once again (like on Heaven's Gate).  This is a great epic film, with some of the most intense scenes ever committed to celluloid.  The storm sequences, which took months to film, is brilliant.  There were no trick shots used.  No CGI (this was 1970).  Everything you see is real, which makes it even more fantastic.  The performances are wonderful all around, Freddie Young's 70mm photography is fabulous, and Lean's direction assured.

The anamorphic picture, made from the original 65mm negative, looks as if it was filmed yesterday. Not a scratch or speck of dust are visible. The image is sharp as a tack, and the colors are beautifully graded, with a wide tonal range and no digital artifacts. Visually, this is a reference quality disc.The sound isn't bad for the period. The stereo image is broad and clean, but rather flat. This is a good one for headphones. Too bad there's no way to turn off Jarre's idiotic music. Imagine if Clannad, or some other traditional Irish band, had written the score instead!Aside from Mitchum, who cannot be blamed, the cast is very fine. Even the minor roles are unusually well handled. Miles is heartbreakingly beautiful. The sex scenes are surprisingly erotic but unfailingly tasteful. The story has a fateful Irish edge; by the intermission, you know you're in for downward spiral of unremitting tragedy.No, RYAN'S DAUGHTER is not as fine as LAWRENCE or ZHIVAGO or even A PASSAGE TO INDIA, but it's still very good indeed, and very beautiful.

His beautiful nubile daughter, portrayed by Sarah Miles, yearns to have a better life and sees the promise of this in marrying the local schoolteacher (Robert Mitchum , despite the age differences, gives a sensitive and heartfelt performance).  Despite the tepid protests by Ryan and the Catholic Priest (excellently casted Trevor Howard) the marriage occurs and after the postnuptial celebrations involving the entire village folk (and colorful they be!) the anxious Rosey settles into the marriage bed--her husband, painfully aware of the many years that separate them, constantly reassures his young wife that all will be as it should, &#34;in time&#34;.  Rosy spends her days between the Tavern and being the good wife.....she feels the pains of regret growing within her when a chance encounter with the new, young Major (Christopher Jones).

It is now the fire of uncertainty and passion begin to engulf the unlikely lovers.....a relationship doomed from the start.  Thruout this spectacular film humor is maintained by the great John Mills, although not readily recognized by his makeup and mannerisms......as the part of Michael, the &#34;village idiot&#34; he stumbles innocently into situations foreign to his comprehension and with the guidance of the ever present Trevor Howard, teaches us all a lesson in humility and wonder.  A major cinematic event is captured on one rainy and windy night (as is so common on the Irish coast) when a German Merchant vessel attempts to send ashore crates of weapons, explosives and ammunition to the awaiting villagers.  The awesome pounding surf and stories-high waves pound the craggy coastline, dashing the secret cargo and spilling its lethal contents.  The people brave the surging seas, often binding themselves with thick ropes and having others to try to hold on while gathering what each wave presents onto shore....I cannot recollect ANY other storm  scene so majestically and spectacularly filmed and my pulse raced from scene to scene as the noble folk--men, women and children, valiantly banded together in this endeavor.  The love scenes between Rosy and the Major were so believable in tenderness and sincerity as were the lusty moments when he would stand on a knoll above the schoolhouse hoping to lure Rosy for one more meeting.  Scenes of the rich countryside as well as the seashore were most deserving of Freddy Young's Academy award for cinematography as was John Mill's Best Supporting Actor as the poor, simple-minded Michael.  A stellar cast and expert direction make Ryan's Daughter a must for your video library.

It was quite amazing, and one must commend the great David Lean for taking a relatively simple story and giving it legitimate epic stature. Oscar-winning cinematography and a glorious score by Lean regular, Maurice Jarre, add to the magnificence. The never nominated Sir John Mills won a most deserved Oscar; indeed, I didn't know it was him until the final credits rolled. Sarah Miles also received her only nomination, in a complex performance that is nothing short of perfection. After reading other reviews, no one mentioned the great Robert Mitchum who, pressured to get married, realizes that his young bride would soon be bored by his sexual impotence. He's probably the least concerned when her infidelity is brought to light. The beautiful Christopher Jones certainly made a mark; too bad he gave up on a film career. And I agree with a previous reviewer  that Lean's ""A Passage to India"" was sorely neglected. Everyone praises ""Kwai"", ""Lawrence"" & ""Zhivago"", but I find I've watched ""Passage"" much more than those others. ""Ryan's Daughter"" was also nominated for ""Best Sound"". Indeed, the turbulence of the Irish coast is almost a character unto itself. I'm very pleased that this film is coming out on a 2-disc DVD.

The film, as well as Mr. Lean, was thoroughly roasted by the critics upon its release as being self-indulgent and boring; a claim that still colors its reputation some 35 years later.  Its running time is over 3 hours (with an intermission) and its pacing can easily be dismissed as tedious for those addicted to today's more hyper-speed level of storytelling.  But it is a beautifully told, magical film, that slowly lingers and draws in its viewer, delivering an incredible evening's fare.  Though it does not rise to the level of Lean's masterpiece, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" it certainly offers many brilliantly directed moments and breathtaking photography, making it a ""must see"" for any film lover.Warner Bros., after an incredibly long wait, has released a beautiful and appropriate DVD release for this classic film.  The film looks incredible!!  Really, it just looks awesome!  The colors are pristine, the print is crystal clear and free from age.  I could not believe how stunning the picture looks.  The film is spread over 2 discs, offering the optimum bit rate to ensure a top-notch transfer.  The sound has been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1 and, though it is far from reference quality, supports the film very well.  (However, on my system, the music sounded incredibly flat.  Particularly the Overture.)There is a bounty of extras that include a thoroughly engaging and informative audio commentary from a wide-range of participants.  The commentaries have been perfectly edited together to form a cohesive narrative that runs throughout the picture.  Very well done.  The additional DVD-specific documentary is of the traditional fare (helmed by the DVD extras master himself, Laurent Bouzereau), offering rare interviews with David Lean and writer, Robert Bolt, as well as recent interviews with many of the film's production crew, recent Lean biographers, and others.  Plenty of good stuff to go around.All-in-all this is an outstanding DVD release for one of Lean's most under-appreciated works.  If you haven't seen it, get this DVD.

Ignored at the time for the showier attractions of Mills' village idiot (a role Norman Wisdom desperately wanted), it's a remarkably intelligent and subtly observed character study that holds far more appeal than Sarah Miles' title role. As always, Lean reserves the real talent (Mills, Trevor Howard, Leo McKern) for the sidelines and comes up with one of his blandest leads in the shape of Peter O'Toole lookalike and future down-and-out Jones while the force of history is reduced to background for a simple love story.Maurice Jarre's score is something of a liability, but overall this is still the best of the director's post-Lawrence films and certainly not fully deserving of the critical slating that led to his 17-year absence from the screen. There is still a very real sense of the cinematic, with both colour and the widescreen ratio exploited to the full, something the increasingly TV-conscious director refused to even attempt with the surprisingly poor A Passage to India.Although much impact is lost in the step down from 70mm to TV screen - particularly during the vivid storm sequence - the widescreen DVD makes it seem like a different and much better film if you've only ever seen it panned-and-scanned before.

An exploration of the fine and sometimes dangerous line between love and fantasy, all stitched seamlessly into an epic backdrop supplied by the struggle for independence in pre-republican Ireland. The movie is a little hindered by the casting of non-Irish actors, reminiscent of the absence of Russian actors in Lean's &quot;Dr. Zhivago.&quot; But disregard this shortcoming and enjoy. There are moments of pure cinema in this film. Savor the jump to a lingering introductory shot of Rose Ryan's semi-fantasy British army officer, standing quietly in the middle distance on a remote country lane. This comes immediately after a noisy  and energetic close-up of Father Collins, on a beach, warning Rose that she might get what she wishes for. Best of all, for me, is the imagery conjured up later by Rose's increasingly suspicious husband, Charles Shaughnessy. He imagines himself silently watching Rose and her soldier strolling together in a scene of intense romance that he knows he himself could never provide for his wife. We watch Charles, on the screen, watching a vision of his own private fears and longings.

It is about community, religion, tradition, youth, discovery, want, war and infidelity. And Sarah Miles is very sexy in her roll as the disillusioned Rose.Rose is a young woman who is trying to come to terms with adulthood and sexuality in the small world of an Irish village. There arn't many good young men around so she has her sights set on an older, single, male schoolteacher, played by Robert Mitchum. Well, after a fanciful marriage and still a virgin, Rose discovers that the teacher isn't such a hot lover, which leaves Rose a bit disappointed.""There must be more."" She tells her priest, played by Trevor Howard.""Be careful what you ask for Rose."" he tells her,  ""Because as sure as hell you'll get it.""And then the movie starts.When this film first came out, I was so spellbound by it that I went to the cinema to see it repeatedly, unlike any other movie. I became totally absorbed in the sheer epic of such a simple love story: the photography, the sensitivity, the location and the characters. Why couldn't other film-makers tell a story with such grace, style and sensuality? Well, I found out that other film-makers didn't have the big budgets that Director David Lean had. So I wonder, could David Lean have made a film on a small budget? Thank God he didn't. We have been left such a rich legacy of fine films from this master craftsman.Critique Pauline Kael panned Ryan's Daughter so badly when it first came out and David Lean took it so hard and personally, that he didn't make another film for fourteen years. Perhaps Ms Kael wasn't sensitive but Mr. Lean's sensitivity shows through more in this film than with most others he's made.  Thank you for your artistry Mr. Lean.Recently, while on a trip to Western Ireland I made a pilgrimage to the end of the Dingle Peninsula where they filmed Ryan's Daughter. Unbelievably, the schoolhouse is still standing where they built it for the movie in 1969, in a farmer's field, on the hillside overlooking the sea.

416916,A3OHZODU6YHOZ3,6304366035,"Written Word ""Written Word""","[2, 2]","No one would argue that David Lean wasn't an exceptionally talented director.  For Ryan's Daughter he assembled a talented cast and beautiful location (Ireland) to paint the picture of two lovers torn asunder by social and political forces.  Unfortunately, unlike Dr. Zvivago which was a critical and commercial success, Ryan's Daughter was unable to match the intensity or impact of Lean's other films.The fault lies mostly in the direction by Lean - this film would have been served by another pass in the editing room to tighten up and shorten some of the scenes and in the case of the two lovers, slow it down a bit to allow the audience to buy into their intense attraction for each other.  I have read that the talented actor who plays Rosy's love interest (Christopher Jones as Major Doryan) was faulted for providing a flat performance - after watching this movie, it is obvious to me he (Christopher Jones) was scapegoated for the lack of more cohesive directing and editing.  Jones hit exactly the right note in portraying the Major as a tragic character - shell schocked from his time at the front and both physically and spiritually a broken man.  There are two seminal scenes in the film where the Major is stricken by his panic attack flashback to the fronts - these are beautifully and subtley played by Jones - watching him struggle to control himself and beat back the panic it is hard not to feel compassion for him.  The character Rosy, played by Sarah Miles, is also hurt by jumps in the story - the scene in the village bar where she meets the Major is rushed and not believable even by today's standards for attraction. Lean would have been better served he he allowed the characters some time to develop a rapport versus exploding into an immediate attraction which seems unlikely based on the social mores of the time and the circumstances of their meeting.  I think that Lean himself wasn't sure how to portray their instant attraction so the next time we see the lovers is in a long, drawn out, strange scene of them riding through the forest looking for a place to have a lover's tryst.  The scene is akward, slow moving and does nothing to help the audience invest emotionally with them.While it is a flawed film - I rate it 4 starts due to the the acting which is superb, some beautiful camera work and a haunting and memorable score.  Sadly, Christopher Jones the young actor who played Major Doryan gave up movies after making this movie and Lean himself didn't make another movie for 14 years.
