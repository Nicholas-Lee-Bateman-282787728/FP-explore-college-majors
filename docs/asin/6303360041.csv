370559,A1AXDPUTA9V3U7,6303360041,Dean Scoby,"[32, 33]","Cary Grant was born in Bristol, England. His father put his mother in an  insane asylum when young Archie Leach (his name at the time) was only a  boy. Grant grew up without a mother, and when he read the script for the  movie, frinds of his such as Frank Sinatra, and Gregory Peck siad he was  overjoyed, and throughout the film's production, too.  Cary really  got to display some emotions in the film he was never given a chance to in  real life until he was an adult.  Ethyl Barrymore's outstanding, Oscar  winning  performance made it all the more easier for Cary to show his  feelings.  Cary was very excited when he took everyone he knew to the  film's premier, but after, all were stunned at the dark, sombre mood of the  film. The Oscars agreed with Cary, however, and gave him his second and  last nomination... but of course he was stiffed because the Acadamey Awards  are often ridiculous.  A young cockney drifter returns home to help  out his poor mother in time of need.  The film is very sad, and grave,  and sombre. There is nothing else like it in the Grant filmography,  although his dramatic turns are always his best roles.  So dark and  grimy, richly dteailed, beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, cleverly  written, and carefully directed, this is one of the greatest films ever  made, certainly in the Grant top five, and the all around top ten or  fifteen.  Those who know Grant and have any brains at all will be  almost shocked by this wonderful display of how motion pictures can truly  affect us.",5,Close to home for Mr. Grant.,965347200,"08 4, 2000",2000,1527,"['Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'born', 'Bristol', 'England', 'father', 'put', 'mother', 'insane', 'asylum', 'when', 'young', 'Archie', 'Leach', 'name', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'boy', 'Grant', 'grew', 'up', 'mother', 'when', 'read', 'script', 'movie', 'frinds', 'such', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'siad', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'film', 'production', 'too', 'Cary', 'really', 'got', 'display', 'emotions', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'adult', 'Ethyl', 'Barrymore', 'outstanding', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'made', 'more', 'easier', 'Cary', 'show', 'feelings', 'Cary', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'took', 'everyone', 'knew', 'film', 'premier', 'were', 'stunned', 'dark', 'sombre', 'mood', 'film', 'Oscars', 'agreed', 'Cary', 'however', 'gave', 'second', 'last', 'nomination', 'course', 'was', 'stiffed', 'Acadamey', 'Awards', 'are', 'often', 'ridiculous', 'young', 'cockney', 'drifter', 'home', 'help', 'out', 'poor', 'mother', 'time', 'need', 'film', 'very', 'sad', 'grave', 'sombre', 'nothing', 'else', 'Grant', 'filmography', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'are', 'always', 'best', 'roles', 'So', 'dark', 'grimy', 'richly', 'dteailed', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'cleverly', 'written', 'carefully', 'directed', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'Grant', 'top', 'five', 'top', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'who', 'know', 'Grant', 'have', 'brains', 'will', 'be', 'almost', 'shocked', 'wonderful', 'display', 'how', 'motion', 'can', 'truly', 'affect']",None But the Lonely Heart VHS
370560,A1E6JS6C205VZD,6303360041,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Based on the novel by Richard Llewellyn, with a script by Clifford Odets (who also directed it), NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART is a socially conscious film, readily recognizable as the work of the author of WAITING FOR LEFTY (a classic social drama of the mid-Thirties),  Ernie Mott (Cary Grant) lives in the back-streets of London, trying to eke out an existence while living with his mother (Ethel Barrymore).  The two of them fight like cat and dog, but once Ernie discovers that his mother is terminally ill, he vows to stay with her no matter what the consequences.  Short of money, Ernie resorts to a life of crime, working for local mobster Jim Mordinoy (George Colouris), and is eventually arraigned by the police after a car-chase (more reminiscent of the streets of Depression-era Chicago than London).  Released on bail by a friendly pawnbroker (Konstantin Shayne), Ernie discovers to his horror that his mother, while pretending to lead a respectable life in her own pawn-shop, has also been involved in a life of crime.  The two of them are reconciled on her death-bed, but Ernie has to face the future on his own.  Although the settings are somewhat stagy, the sincerity of this drama is not in doubt: Odets has a gift for creating memorable sequences, with a clever use of light and shade suggesting Ernie's imprisonment.  Although not actually in jail, he cannot escape his existence: the desperate search for  money to live on will never end.  Nonetheless he resolves to face the future with equanimity - in a time of war, it's important for everyone to forget their individual grievances and pull together.  This is suggested in a memorable exchange at the end with Henry Twite (Barry Fitzgerald), as the two of them look down at the River Thames flowing beneath them, and walk to the river-side down a flight of stairs.  As Ernie, Grant gets the chance to demonstrate his virtuosity as an actor; normally associated with light comedy, he rarely had the chance to grapple with meatier, tragic roles.  The scene where he suddenly discovers the seamier side of life, as he watches the pawnbroker being beaten up by Mordinoy's gang is particularly memorable: Odets repeatedly cuts to reaction-shots of his facial expression gradually changing, and then cuts back to a medium shot as Grant/Ernie fells one of the gang-members who is about to hit a defenseless old man.  While NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART is a propaganda peace, released in the penultimate year of World War II, it nonetheless has a social message that can be understood by everyone about the necessity to eliminate poverty by caring for others around us.",4,Low-Key but Intensely Sincere Analysis of Poverty,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,2628,"['Based', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Llewellyn', 'script', 'Clifford', 'Odets', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'NONE', 'BUT', 'THE', 'LONELY', 'HEART', 'socially', 'conscious', 'film', 'readily', 'recognizable', 'work', 'author', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'LEFTY', 'classic', 'social', 'drama', 'mid-Thirties', 'Ernie', 'Mott', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'back-streets', 'London', 'trying', 'eke', 'out', 'existence', 'living', 'mother', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'two', 'fight', 'cat', 'dog', 'once', 'Ernie', 'discovers', 'mother', 'terminally', 'ill', 'stay', 'matter', 'what', 'consequences', 'Short', 'money', 'Ernie', 'life', 'crime', 'working', 'local', 'mobster', 'Jim', 'Mordinoy', 'George', 'Colouris', 'eventually', 'arraigned', 'police', 'car-chase', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'streets', 'Depression-era', 'Chicago', 'London', 'Released', 'bail', 'friendly', 'pawnbroker', 'Konstantin', 'Shayne', 'Ernie', 'horror', 'mother', 'pretending', 'lead', 'respectable', 'life', 'own', 'pawn-shop', 'also', 'been', 'involved', 'life', 'crime', 'two', 'are', 'reconciled', 'death-bed', 'Ernie', 'face', 'future', 'own', 'settings', 'are', 'somewhat', 'stagy', 'sincerity', 'drama', 'not', 'doubt', 'Odets', 'gift', 'creating', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'clever', 'use', 'light', 'shade', 'suggesting', 'Ernie', 'imprisonment', 'not', 'actually', 'jail', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'existence', 'desperate', 'search', 'money', 'live', 'will', 'never', 'end', 'face', 'future', 'equanimity', 'time', 'war', 'important', 'everyone', 'forget', 'individual', 'grievances', 'pull', 'together', 'suggested', 'memorable', 'exchange', 'end', 'Henry', 'Twite', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'two', 'look', 'down', 'River', 'Thames', 'flowing', 'walk', 'river-side', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'Ernie', 'Grant', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'virtuosity', 'actor', 'normally', 'associated', 'light', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'had', 'chance', 'grapple', 'meatier', 'tragic', 'roles', 'scene', 'where', 'suddenly', 'seamier', 'side', 'life', 'pawnbroker', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'Mordinoy', 'gang', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Odets', 'repeatedly', 'cuts', 'reaction-shots', 'facial', 'expression', 'gradually', 'changing', 'then', 'cuts', 'back', 'medium', 'shot', 'Grant/Ernie', 'one', 'gang-members', 'who', 'hit', 'defenseless', 'old', 'man', 'NONE', 'BUT', 'THE', 'LONELY', 'HEART', 'propaganda', 'peace', 'released', 'penultimate', 'year', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'nonetheless', 'social', 'message', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'everyone', 'necessity', 'eliminate', 'poverty', 'caring', 'others']",None But the Lonely Heart VHS
370561,A2MRRDJSDVOCUM,6303360041,Grant,"[5, 5]","NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART (1944)This is a very emotionally draining film. What spectactular performances by Grant, Barrymore, Wyatt and Duprez. Cary Grants restless drifter really makes you feel his frustration with life and society in pre ww2 England. Duprez is lovely as the target of a ruthless crime bosses not so innocent affections. She is a kindred spirit to Cary that sees him for the decent but troubled guy he really is.Wyatt is charming as the female friend of Grant that hoplessly and not too secretly longs for him. However, the real treat in this movie is the dynamic between Grant as the son and Ethel Barrymore as the mother desperate to get him on the right path, even if it destroys her.There is a wonderful scene when she buys Grant a new suit and they sit down to dinner together. He knows her secret that she's trying to keep from him and the facial reactions of both of them are highly emotional. His final scene with her is nothing less than gut wrenching. Grant restlessly wanders the streets at night. The cinematography, the rain and the gray color palette helps relay to the viewer Grants feelings of being closed in, clausterphobic and his sense of futility about his life.Another great pleasure in this film is Cary Grants friendship with the Barry Fitzgerald character, dispensing helpful bits of wisdom.

Ethel Barrymore was always good, and especially with a great script to work from by Clifford Odets and Richard Llewellyn. With Odets directing, he really got a great piece of work from all who were in it. I know the great comedian that was Cary Grant. I know him of the high suspense, of Hitchcock films and others of that ilk. But I was so moved by this entire movie. What a great role for Grant to be able to play. Really used his real English accent. Showed more real depth of character, with struggle, and breaking heart of a girlfriend, but even more of the care he had for his mother. As well as her's for him.

The film is partly metaphysical and reflects on old-time family values. It touches upon such diverse topics such as war, materialism, anti-Semitism, and futility of life. When poverty dominate life, the values sometimes a takes a second seat, but Ernie changes his ""drifter"" life style and decides to take care of his dying widowed mother and even accepts to take the responsibility of having wife in his life in war-torn London.The film is about a widowed woman named Ma Mott who runs a secondhand furniture shop tries her best to teach responsibility to her only son, Ernie, who slowly learns responsibility. He has two girls in his life; the glamorous Ada (June Duprez) and Aggie, a cellist (Jane Wyatt). Both like him, but he admits that he favors Ada, but eventually he losses her to her autocratic ex-husband. Ernie befriends and works for a mobster boss from whom he learns unhealthy ways of life.  Near the end of the film, both Mott and his Ma have been arrested for trading their honest ways and going after a quick dishonest gain of selling stolen merchandize. Mott, bailed out of jail by his Jewish friend Mr. Weber, visits his dying mother in jail for the last time.The movie has some unique screen writings by Clifford Odets based on the Richard Llewellyn novel. Odets was a sensation on Broadway and his work focused on the need for social and economic justice by his powerful illustration of poverty. In one instant Ernie says; ""Stand back! Let the man see the rabbit,"" to express his desire to experience life as he sees fit. At another instant, Ernie asks ""When will the world awake from this midnight, when will humanity get up from its knees?"" An apparent reference to the man shackled by poverty and prevents him from doing well for the fellow men. At another instant, Ernie says; ""They say money talks... all it's ever said to me is goodbye."" Lela E. Rogers, the mother of actress Ginger Rogers (both well known fighters of communist sympathizers in Hollywood), testified at a committee hearing of HUAC (House Committee on Un-American Activities) that a script of the movie as a perfect example of communism and accused Clifford Odets of being a Communist sympathizer. Rogers cited the line spoken by Ernie to his mother, ""You're not going to get me to work here and squeeze pennies out of little people who are poorer than I am.""The recreation of London's back streets on RKO's back lots and sound stages is magnificent, and the work by Ethel Barrymore was rewarded with an Academy award in the supporting role. Cary Grant was nominated in the best actor category but lost only to Bing Crosby. At one time Richard Llewellyn opposed to the casting of Cary Grant; he did not like a 40-year-old actor playing the 19-year-old character of Ernie Mott.

They were smart enough though to reward Miss Barrymore with supporting actress.",5,none but the lonely,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,390,"['Cary', 'Grants', 'best', 'acting', 'as', 'far', 'have', 'ever', 'seenThe', 'chemistry', 'Miss', 'Barrymore', 'mother', 'heartfelt', 'warm', 'not', 'first', 'Have', 'hanky', 'last', 'scene', 'mum', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'usual', 'career', 'was', 'overlooked', 'as', 'far', 'Oscar', 'were', 'concerned', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'reward', 'Miss', 'Barrymore', 'supporting', 'actress']",None But the Lonely Heart VHS

The film is dark and brooding, and if you don't feel like crying, save this one for another day. But my goodness, I must tell you the scenes between Ethel Barry more and Cary Grant will pierce your heart. They are justterrific. This is my favorite Cary Grant film.

All that we love and appreciate about Cray Grant's films is evident in his performance as Ernie Mott.  It takes a very fine actor to walk a line between humor and despair.  All the actors are stellar.Cary was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  He should have won.Ethyl Barrymore returning about a decade's appearance from the screen did win - for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.Do yourself a favor and watch the film.  You won't be sorry.As reported by another reviewer, the DVD transfer is fine.
