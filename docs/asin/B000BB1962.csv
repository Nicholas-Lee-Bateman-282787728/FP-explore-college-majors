938726,A3PHTB9X7B11XL,B000BB1962,C.A. Arthur,"[36, 36]","This is one of the very best modern television series  available.  Pauline Collins, a skilled comedienne, proves that she can handle a challenging dramatic role with immense skill and subtlety.  The rest of the cast is similarly outstanding.  The series, a product of  several different writers, concerns the English ambassador to Ireland (Collins), her two sons, and several of her assistants.  Each story, set in the present, is completely absorbing.  There is a noticeable absence of sex and violence, intelligence being used in their place.  Five stars.",5,First rate drama,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,557,"['one', 'very', 'best', 'modern', 'television', 'series', 'available', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'skilled', 'comedienne', 'can', 'handle', 'challenging', 'dramatic', 'role', 'immense', 'skill', 'subtlety', 'rest', 'cast', 'similarly', 'outstanding', 'series', 'product', 'several', 'different', 'writers', 'English', 'ambassador', 'Ireland', 'Collins', 'two', 'sons', 'several', 'assistants', 'story', 'set', 'present', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'noticeable', 'absence', 'sex', 'violence', 'intelligence', 'being', 'used', 'place', 'Five', 'stars']",The Ambassador

938728,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000BB1962,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[4, 4]","I concur with the previous reviewer that ""The Ambassador"" is British TV at its best--great script, great direction, and MOST OF ALL great acting!  The program is really highly entertaining keeping this viewer on the edge of  his seat!Since the series ""Upstairs Downstairs"" from the 1970s, Pauline Collins has been a favorite actress of mine.  In this series, she proves that she can do heavy dramas as well as comedies with the best of them.  She is so very convincing as the British ambassador to Ireland.  She portrays so very well a character that is very proficient at her job while at the same time, she is good at balancing being a widow, a single mom, a woman in a man's world (the men she works with DO question her almost every decision).  No matter how tense or threatening the situation may be,she comes across as a caring human being that always tries to bring some humanity to her decision making.  In fact, this series is filled with great actors--many that I've seen in other British presentations.The ""bottom line"" for me is that ""the Ambassador"" series is GREAT entertainment!  It shows what a really good T.V. program can be!! I was highly entertained--great and timely stories plus great acting--wow!If you want to see what a great TV program is like, buy this DVD.",5,HIGHLY ENTERTAINING,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1284,"['concur', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Ambassador', 'British', 'TV', 'best', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'direction', 'MOST', 'ALL', 'great', 'acting', 'program', 'really', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'edge', 'seat', 'series', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', '1970s', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'been', 'favorite', 'actress', 'mine', 'series', 'can', 'do', 'heavy', 'dramas', 'as', 'well', 'comedies', 'best', 'so', 'very', 'convincing', 'British', 'ambassador', 'Ireland', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'character', 'very', 'proficient', 'job', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'balancing', 'being', 'widow', 'single', 'mom', 'woman', 'man', 'world', 'men', 'DO', 'question', 'almost', 'decision', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'tense', 'threatening', 'situation', 'may', 'be', 'across', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'always', 'bring', 'humanity', 'decision', 'making', 'fact', 'series', 'filled', 'great', 'actors', 'many', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'British', 'presentations.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Ambassador', 'series', 'GREAT', 'entertainment', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'T.V', 'program', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'highly', 'entertained', 'great', 'timely', 'stories', 'great', 'acting', 'wow', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'TV', 'program', 'buy', 'DVD']",The Ambassador
