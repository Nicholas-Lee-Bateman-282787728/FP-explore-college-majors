203835,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,6300183580,AbeStreet,"[3, 3]","Hitchcock is of course known for his suspenseful movies but his films are also known for their cross country pursuits (THIRTY NINE STEPS), dark humor (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY), action climax (TORN CURTAIN), blond heroine (REAR WINDOW) and special effects (THE BIRDS).  Rarely is the film carried by the strength of the actors.ROPE is one of Hitchcock's few films that ignore most of the typical attributes mentioned above, except for some dark humor, and allows the actors to carry the whole story.  There is no mystery in this film for the viewers as we witness the murder at the start of the film.  The suspense is generated by the actors as they deal with the absence of the murder victim from a party hosted by the two murderers.  The family, fiance and friend of the victim, who don't know he has been killed, become increasingly upset at his absence from the party.  The maid helps fuel the tension as she gossips while conducting her duties. The former headmaster of the school the murder victim, the two hosts and the other young male guest all attended puts the pieces together.  Meanwhile, the two hosts try and drop as many hints as they can that the missing party member has been killed and that they did it.  For one of the hosts it seems to fuel his own idea that he is superior to all his guests and that if they were his equal they could figure it all out.  The other host can barely keep it together as he experiences doubt and regret about what he has done and worries about being caught.Rope boasts some big named actors such as James Stewart and Sir Cedric Hardwicke but also brings some less known actors such as John Dall and Douglas Dick.  The mix works out fine.  Stewart, who breaks from his ""down home-everyman roles, is perfect as the philosophical headmaster who with his abstract ideas that he passed on to his students really is responsible for the killing that takes place.  I really enjoyed watching Joan Chandler as the soon to be fiance of the murdered man.  It was a treat to see Hitchcock use a brunette instead of his standard blonde for this movie.This was Hitchcock's first color movie and the set is beautiful.  The view of the city from the killers apartment is so life like it is hard to believe that it is a manufactured setting.Lastly, the DVD for this movie also includes the trailer.  The trailer is the only time the viewer gets to see the murder victim alive and it adds some backdrop to the relationship between the victim and his soon to be fiance.  The documentary was well done and informative",5,Simple but Satisfying!!,1048118400,"03 20, 2003",2003,2544,"['Hitchcock', 'course', 'known', 'suspenseful', 'movies', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'known', 'cross', 'country', 'pursuits', 'THIRTY', 'NINE', 'STEPS', 'dark', 'humor', 'THE', 'TROUBLE', 'WITH', 'HARRY', 'action', 'climax', 'TORN', 'CURTAIN', 'blond', 'heroine', 'REAR', 'WINDOW', 'special', 'effects', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'Rarely', 'film', 'carried', 'strength', 'actors.ROPE', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'few', 'films', 'ignore', 'most', 'typical', 'attributes', 'mentioned', 'dark', 'humor', 'actors', 'carry', 'whole', 'story', 'mystery', 'film', 'viewers', 'witness', 'murder', 'start', 'film', 'suspense', 'generated', 'actors', 'deal', 'absence', 'murder', 'victim', 'party', 'hosted', 'two', 'murderers', 'family', 'fiance', 'friend', 'victim', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'killed', 'become', 'increasingly', 'upset', 'absence', 'party', 'maid', 'fuel', 'tension', 'conducting', 'duties', 'former', 'headmaster', 'school', 'murder', 'victim', 'two', 'hosts', 'other', 'young', 'male', 'guest', 'attended', 'pieces', 'together', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'hosts', 'try', 'drop', 'many', 'hints', 'can', 'missing', 'party', 'member', 'been', 'killed', 'did', 'one', 'hosts', 'fuel', 'own', 'idea', 'superior', 'guests', 'were', 'equal', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'other', 'host', 'can', 'barely', 'keep', 'together', 'doubt', 'regret', 'what', 'done', 'worries', 'being', 'caught.Rope', 'big', 'named', 'actors', 'such', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Sir', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'also', 'less', 'known', 'actors', 'such', 'John', 'Dall', 'Douglas', 'Dick', 'mix', 'out', 'fine', 'Stewart', 'who', 'down', 'home-everyman', 'roles', 'perfect', 'philosophical', 'headmaster', 'who', 'abstract', 'ideas', 'passed', 'students', 'really', 'responsible', 'killing', 'place', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'soon', 'be', 'fiance', 'murdered', 'man', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'use', 'brunette', 'instead', 'standard', 'blonde', 'movie.This', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'color', 'movie', 'set', 'beautiful', 'view', 'city', 'killers', 'apartment', 'so', 'life', 'hard', 'believe', 'manufactured', 'setting.Lastly', 'DVD', 'movie', 'also', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'only', 'time', 'viewer', 'see', 'murder', 'victim', 'alive', 'backdrop', 'relationship', 'victim', 'soon', 'be', 'fiance', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'informative']",N/A

Inside an apartment two young men are strangling another young man. A thrill killing by sadists behind drawn curtains? Have they committed the perfect murder? Brandon is in charge (his speeches tell this came from a stage play). Philip shows regret, Brandon is excited over the murder. Next there is a party where the parents of the murdered man and others will attend. Brandon's megalomania starts to show; he is perfect. The guests begin to show up. The conversations tell us more about the people and their empty lives.Rupert Caddell, their former housemaster at school, shows up. People talk to tell about themselves. Philip has an odd reason for avoiding chickens. Housemaster Rupert has a weird personality; he talks about murdering people on a whim. Brandon prattles on about Nietzsche (an insane philosopher actually admired in some places). Janet is embarrassed by Brandon's actions; she had dropped him as a boyfriend. Rupert's talk with Philip causes him distress. There is suspense when the maid attempts to open that large storage chest. Rupert finds a hat that doesn't fit. (A clue to the man who wore it.) Then Rupert returns to hold a conversation with Brandon. Philip's nerves break and a crisis occurs. [You can figure out how this story will end.]This story was based on a famous crime. It criticizes the insane philosophy taught in some universities; whose purpose is to justify the oppression of ordinary people by their ruling class. Would such a play be successful today? William Jennings Bryan warned against Darwinian philosophy and its logical outcome.

This is both typical and non-typical Hitchcock.  The suspense is there, naturally, and the atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  It is certainly enthralling, philosophical, and peppered with typical Hitchcock dark humor.  Still, it left me wanting... this is by far the shortest Universal picture he ever made, and it shows.  It just ends, and it left me really wanting more and more... there are no car chases, no climatic finales atop Mount Rushmore or a shootout in an opera house.  It just ends, neatly and quickly.  This lack of action can most be compared to &quot;Rear Window,&quot; but &quot;Rope&quot; lacks the voyueristic fetishism that made that movie such a classic human drama.

203841,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,6300183580,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[1, 1]","ROPE had me riveted to my seat, right up to the end. The story was based on a play, which was in turn based on the real life crime of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, about two intellectual and upper class young men who decide to murder one of their peers because they feel superior to the common man and believe they are above ordinary laws. So smug are the men -- especially the more dominant one -- that they leave the dead body in a chest and throw a dinner party with a guest list that includes the victim's father, aunt, fianc&eacute;, and ex-best friend.The tension mounts as one of the murderers continues to drop hints of foul play, while the other one starts to crack under the pressure.Actors John Dall ""Brandon Shaw"" and Farley Granger ""Phillip Morgan,"" deliver great performances but at first glance it would seem as though they can't act. However, viewers must remind themselves that these are actors portraying people who are ""acting"" badly in front of others because they're hiding something. The audience will see slivers of instances where Dall and Granger are alone together and they go back into the natural state of their respective character.Another interesting note is the filming technique that the brilliant director, Alfred Hitchcock, decided to use. ROPE is filmed entirely as one continuous take, but in about 10-minute segments because they had to change to the next film reel, and so there are no edits or cuts, aside from the 10-minute mark where the camera will zoom in and out. The camera literally becomes an unblinking eye that moves and focuses, sometimes away from the action, on items of interest. This might be a little uncomfortable for some viewers, even though they might not even realize that's what it is, but it creates this feeling, as viewers, that we are staring; we become voyeurs in this macabre and sadistic game and can't turn away.As far as the two main characters being gay, well that's only subtly implied. Remember that this was filmed in the 40s and homosexuality was a no-no, but viewers will infer that these two are a couple by how they interact with one another.The restoration is great with the picture being very clear, no dust or scratches or artifacts, and the color palette isn't garish. This was Hitchcock's first color film and in the special featurette, screen writer Arthur Laurents, who wrote the screenplay for ROPE, says that the film had to be re-shot at the time because the color was overly saturated.=====  SPECIAL FEATURES  =====* 32:20-MINUTE FEATURETTE -- ""ROPE UNLEASHED"" *This featurette filmed in 2000 features Hume Cronyn (adaptation), Arthur Laurents (screenplay), Farley Granger (lead actor ""Phillip Morgan""), and Pat Hitchcock (daughter of director) discussing ""ROPE,"" the challenges with filming, and the story behind the movie and play.

203842,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300183580,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","So, I've been a fan of Hitchcock for years, but I had never seen this 1948 classic.  My friends berated me for a while, stated that if I was a fan of the director I had to see this film.  They raved how it was one of his most creative and effective ventures, and now that I've seen it I have to say that they are 100% correct.  From start to finish, this film is thrilling and exciting and the final frames with that `confrontation' completely took my breath away.The film tells the story of two young men, one the more dominant, who decide to strangle a classmate that they deem inferior and then invite his family and girlfriend over to dinner while the body rots in the chest in the dining room.  Adapted from a stage play that was inspired by actual events, this chilling film captures the subtlety of tension with each passing frame, and the fact that the frame rarely passes (it is shot in real time and in one long take, broken up by periodic blackness necessary for the cameras to change reels) makes the film all the more engaging.  It's not only a marvel of storytelling, but a technical experiment that paid off in spades.The jittery and somewhat manic performances by the film's stars, John Dall and Farley Granger, create a basis for the audiences connection to the film, and the brilliant supporting performances, especially that of LEGEND James Stewart make this film a true masterpiece.  Stewarts eyes do a lot of talking and completely unravel the surprise before our eyes.

203843,A13H2JJ3GEMJN1,6300183580,"AntiochAndy ""antiochandy""","[0, 0]","I was a bit disappointed with this movie. It begins with two young men using a piece of rope to strangle another young man. I have to say that I hope I would put up more of a struggle if two guys tried to strangle me. He doesn't strike out or kick at all. Neither of the two stranglers gets even a scratch and no furniture is upset or broken. Another troubling point is the whole notion that such a murder would be committed simply as an intellectual exercise. For the challenge of doing it and not getting caught, as it were. As horrendous and improbable as this idea is, though, I can't fault the movie for it. The story is based on an real-life murder case.What you're left with is a pretty straightforward plot. There is no mystery and the audience is simply left to wait and see whether the killers will be found out. After committing the murder and hiding the body, the two murderers spend the next twenty minutes or so justifying their actions and trying to reassure themselves. This part is rather appalling and it certainly doesn't engage the watcher's sympathy. It seems to drag and leaves you impatient for something to happen. Once all the guests have arrived, the tension begins to mount.There's no major character to engage your sympathy in a positive way until near the end. Even Stewart's character is a cold fish whose elitist ideas are used to justify the murder. Add to this the unique way the film was shot, with no obvious breaks but with the whole stretch of time from the murder through the setting-up of the dinner party and then the whole of the party itself telescoped down into 81 minutes, and you get a film with an odd feel to it. Less like an engaging story and more like a lab experiment.Despite these criticisms, this is a good dramatic movie. The acting is very good. Stewart gets the top billing, but Granger and Dall have the biggest roles. There is also plenty of tension in the later part of the story, and the psychological study of the characters played by Dall and Granger is fascinating as the pressure of guilt and suspicion mounts.&quot;Rope&quot; has some shortcomings, and does not represent Hitchcock's best work.

203844,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300183580,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 10/06, 12/12Rate: 410/06: Amazing, Rope is made in 1948, and already it's so groundbreaking innovative. The acting is perfect. The dialogue is perfect. The setting is perfect. The direction is perfect. The suspense is perfect. The characters are perfect. Everything about Rope is perfect. Rope is so way ahead of its time, and it probably gives a lot of information that was discovered later in the research of serial killers. Those who get excited sexually by killing another. Those who find morbid adventure fascinating by the thrill of involving others unbeknownst to themselves that there is a dead body in the surroundings. In all said, Rope is a definitive Hitchcock masterpiece. And it belongs in any top films list. Also, I come to think Rope as Ten Little Indians meets Dial M for Murder. Among Hitchcock's films, this one ranks one of his bests. Three players that deserve standing ovations for their acting performances are: James Stewart, Farley Granger, and John Dall. Surprisingly, John Dall hasn't been involved in many pictures, and this is where John Dall is best at.12/12: The first time I saw Rope, I was enthralled with it. But now, I realize that it is an annoying movie to watch. First thing off, it's a very talky picture in a theatrical way. The characters are too lame. And the conversations are hammy. Probably ten minutes or so into the party, it has gotten too obvious that the killers, well mostly Brandon, just wanted to be predictably caught. Rupert, played somewhat well by Jimmy Stewart, had already figured it out at the 50th minute mark. From that point thereon, it develops into half an hour chore of a sitting and waiting for the revelation to come into light to the killers. They threw too many clues to make it all too obvious. In short, Rope is a pretty boring film. However, I am giving it a `4' because it is a very technically well-shot picture. Imagine trying to make a movie in one single room for the entire duration. In other words, Rope feels like it was shot in one day. Another is the gradual shift of the daylight-to-night through the orangery. Sometimes, I think how fake the city background looks, but there are certain aspects about it that make it real and illuminating along with the changing of the clouds. One thing I don't like about the room is the placement of the neon lights in front of the bricked building facing the windows of the apartment. Let's be realistic: why would a businessman would set up that way only that the letters are mostly blocked by an apartment when they are meant for the public view? I know: Hitchcock wanted to add the noir aspect. Farley Granger is annoying to watch in Rope, and John Dall is too much to handle. All in all, Rope is a technically good picture, but anything more than that, it's better to study the mistakes. By the way, it's been suggested that the two were in-closet homosexuals. I am like, ""Huh? Grow up."" I am dropping the rating of the film from `10' to `4'.",2,Overly Theatrical But Technically Good.,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,2977,"['Viewed', '10/06', '12/12Rate', '410/06', 'Amazing', 'Rope', 'made', '1948', 'already', 'so', 'groundbreaking', 'innovative', 'acting', 'perfect', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'setting', 'perfect', 'direction', 'perfect', 'suspense', 'perfect', 'characters', 'are', 'perfect', 'Everything', 'Rope', 'perfect', 'Rope', 'so', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'probably', 'lot', 'information', 'was', 'discovered', 'later', 'research', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'get', 'excited', 'sexually', 'killing', 'who', 'find', 'morbid', 'adventure', 'fascinating', 'thrill', 'involving', 'others', 'unbeknownst', 'dead', 'body', 'surroundings', 'said', 'Rope', 'definitive', 'Hitchcock', 'masterpiece', 'top', 'films', 'list', 'Also', 'come', 'think', 'Rope', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'one', 'one', 'bests', 'Three', 'players', 'deserve', 'standing', 'ovations', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'John', 'Dall', 'Surprisingly', 'John', 'Dall', ""n't"", 'been', 'involved', 'many', 'pictures', 'where', 'John', 'Dall', 'best', 'at.12/12', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Rope', 'was', 'enthralled', 'now', 'realize', 'annoying', 'movie', 'watch', 'First', 'thing', 'off', 'very', 'talky', 'picture', 'theatrical', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'lame', 'conversations', 'are', 'hammy', 'Probably', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'party', 'gotten', 'too', 'obvious', 'killers', 'well', 'mostly', 'Brandon', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'predictably', 'caught', 'Rupert', 'played', 'somewhat', 'well', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'had', 'already', 'figured', 'out', '50th', 'minute', 'mark', 'point', 'thereon', 'hour', 'chore', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'revelation', 'come', 'light', 'killers', 'threw', 'too', 'many', 'clues', 'make', 'too', 'obvious', 'short', 'Rope', 'pretty', 'boring', 'film', 'However', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'very', 'technically', 'well-shot', 'picture', 'Imagine', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'single', 'room', 'entire', 'duration', 'other', 'words', 'Rope', 'was', 'shot', 'one', 'day', 'gradual', 'shift', 'daylight-to-night', 'orangery', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'how', 'fake', 'city', 'background', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'make', 'real', 'illuminating', 'along', 'changing', 'clouds', 'One', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'room', 'placement', 'neon', 'lights', 'front', 'bricked', 'building', 'facing', 'windows', 'apartment', 'Let', 'be', 'realistic', 'why', 'would', 'businessman', 'would', 'set', 'up', 'way', 'only', 'letters', 'are', 'mostly', 'blocked', 'apartment', 'when', 'are', 'meant', 'public', 'view', 'know', 'Hitchcock', 'wanted', 'add', 'noir', 'aspect', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'annoying', 'watch', 'Rope', 'John', 'Dall', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'Rope', 'technically', 'good', 'picture', 'anything', 'more', 'better', 'study', 'mistakes', 'way', 'been', 'suggested', 'two', 'were', 'in-closet', 'homosexuals', 'am', 'Huh', 'Grow', 'up', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', 'film', '10', '4']",N/A
203845,A1D22OU25XABAK,6300183580,Baranabus,"[2, 3]","Actually, the most interesting things about this movie are the backstories, such as the Leopold-Loeb case it was based on, and how the film makers had to sidestep around the gay issue because of the times, and also the famous ""one-take"" extended shots and the logistics of that technique.For those confused about the philosophical angle, the professor's hypocrisy, etc. keep in mind that it was based on the famous case of two wealthy, privileged lovers who were heavily influenced by Nietzsche and the ""superman"" philosophies about superior individuals who are not behelden to social rules. They wanted to commit the perfect crime, probably out of sociopathy, but also out of some whacked-out philosophy they held. I don't know if there was a real-life parallel to the Stewart character of the professor; it is more likely to be a plot device than an actual person. Which would explain his bizarre logic, lack of believability, etc. Stewart does his best, but it's a very odd character that is obviously devised to evoke the philosophical discussions to reflect the actual case, and then moralize at the end to redeem the film's moral theme. (The screenwriter couldn't have had the two leads discuss the philosophy before, during or after killing amongst themselves; that would've been even more ridiculous and would've been hard to believe)Also, the L & L couple were actually gay; this is not simple Hollywood homophobia. Although the notorious case probably did much to equate gay sexuality with homicidal mental illness in the public imagination in real life.Get a copy with a commentary track to hear all this stuff; otherwise, the film is somewhat dry and not the best of any of the 3 greats involved: Hitchcock, Stewart or Granger. Also, the fact that it's in color detracts from the noir feel considerably, and the color saturation seems weird for such a dark story. But Granger's comments on how they had to move things around on the set to keep the shots continuous are amusing; staff had to push chairs under him at exactly the right moment, etc. The sets were constantly in motion. It would've been really great to see footage of the filming and this complicated, choreographed motion. Outside of that, the film has some suspense, of course. And I always love the gorgeous Farley Granger doing his deer-in-the-headlights expression. He played the trapped-and-confused bit better than anyone in all of film noir, in my opinion. But the films closing speech by Stewart gets a bit ponderous as he struggles to redeem the film's darker spirit.",3,Not his best but worth watching,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2552,"['Actually', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'backstories', 'such', 'Leopold-Loeb', 'case', 'was', 'based', 'how', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'sidestep', 'gay', 'issue', 'times', 'also', 'famous', 'one-take', 'extended', 'shots', 'logistics', 'technique.For', 'confused', 'philosophical', 'angle', 'professor', 'hypocrisy', 'etc', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'based', 'famous', 'case', 'two', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'lovers', 'who', 'were', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Nietzsche', 'superman', 'philosophies', 'superior', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'behelden', 'social', 'rules', 'wanted', 'commit', 'perfect', 'crime', 'probably', 'sociopathy', 'also', 'whacked-out', 'philosophy', 'held', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'real-life', 'parallel', 'Stewart', 'character', 'professor', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'plot', 'device', 'actual', 'person', 'Which', 'would', 'explain', 'bizarre', 'logic', 'lack', 'believability', 'etc', 'Stewart', 'best', 'very', 'odd', 'character', 'obviously', 'devised', 'evoke', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'reflect', 'actual', 'case', 'then', 'moralize', 'end', 'redeem', 'film', 'moral', 'theme', 'screenwriter', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'two', 'leads', 'discuss', 'philosophy', 'killing', 'amongst', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hard', 'believe', 'Also', 'L', 'L', 'couple', 'were', 'actually', 'gay', 'not', 'simple', 'Hollywood', 'homophobia', 'notorious', 'case', 'probably', 'did', 'much', 'equate', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'homicidal', 'mental', 'illness', 'public', 'imagination', 'real', 'life.Get', 'copy', 'commentary', 'track', 'hear', 'stuff', 'otherwise', 'film', 'somewhat', 'dry', 'not', 'best', '3', 'greats', 'involved', 'Hitchcock', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'Also', 'fact', 'color', 'detracts', 'noir', 'feel', 'considerably', 'color', 'saturation', 'weird', 'such', 'dark', 'story', 'Granger', 'comments', 'how', 'had', 'move', 'things', 'set', 'keep', 'shots', 'continuous', 'are', 'amusing', 'staff', 'had', 'push', 'chairs', 'exactly', 'right', 'moment', 'etc', 'sets', 'were', 'constantly', 'motion', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'footage', 'filming', 'complicated', 'choreographed', 'motion', 'film', 'suspense', 'course', 'always', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'doing', 'deer-in-the-headlights', 'expression', 'played', 'trapped-and-confused', 'bit', 'better', 'anyone', 'film', 'noir', 'opinion', 'films', 'closing', 'speech', 'Stewart', 'bit', 'ponderous', 'redeem', 'film', 'darker', 'spirit']",N/A
203846,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6300183580,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Hitchcock does not make a cameo appearance in this one, as the entire story takes place in one comparatively small apartment, and we don't even see much of that. The living room and the dining room, plus the hallway to the outside, are all we see. Indeed, this would work very well as a stage play for that very reason. Perhaps it has been done.It's not a who-dunnit by any means, we see the murder in the first scene. The rest of the story answers two important questions: Why? Will they get caught? The answers are, typical of Hitchcock, very complicated.Phillip (Farley Granger) and Brandon (John Dall) were roommates in prep school. The twist of their minds was suggested by the real-life Leopold & Loeb, but the resemblance ends there. Leopold & Loeb were gay, and lovers, and one might infer the same about Phillip and Brandon, but no strong suggestion is made. This is, after all, 1948. Anyway, Phillip and Brandon kill David Kentley (with the rope of the title), then put him into an antique chest in the living room, where they put candelabra and the fixings of a buffet party to which they have invited David's father (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and mother (who didn't come, but was represented by her sister, David's aunt). They have also invited David's fiance and her former boyfriend. Of course they say they have invited David, and are as perplexed as everyone else when he doesn't show up.But they went too far. Phillip especially is enjoying a feeling of superiority, having committed the ""perfect murder,"" and is totally confident that they will not be found out. As part of his bravado, he has also invited Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who had been the boys' teacher in prep school. He's amusingly cynical, and gets into talking about some of his pet ideas, apparently largely taken from Nietzsche, about murder being wrong for most people, but acceptable for the superior (ubermenche) to rid the world of the inferior sort of person. Mr. Cadell knows these boys well, better than they know themselves, apparently. He starts asking awkward questions as Brandon drinks too much and is clearly under a great deal of strain.So sit back and study all the little mistakes these ""perfect murderers"" make. It's a rather amazing psychodrama, but then Hitchcock is famous for that sort of thing.

203847,A38B1TAM6HZOXA,6300183580,B. J Robbins,"[3, 11]","Hitch has made so many great films, he is allowed a dud.  Obviously, ""Rope"" was originally a play.  The original script seems to have been retained, instead of turning it into a screenplay.  The novel technique of filming the movie as if it were a play (done by the AFT for television some years ago), does not really work.  Film and the theater are two very different mediums and require very different treatments.  To take a film and direct it as if it were a play denies the film of all the unique qualities that make it a film and not a play.  It makes no sense.  The lack of music, some long speeches, and use of mainly one set says play, not film.  The plot was done better in the film ""Compulsion"", also based on the Leopold and Loeb case, with Orson Welles' great performance as Clarence Darrow.  See that film instead.And the acting.  There seems to be much overacting, which can go unnoticed on the stage, which demands projection and forcefulness.  However, screen performances, even if they are directed as if they were a play, demand more subtle, subdued performances.  Some plays make a successful transition to film.  O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" I feel made a good transition to film  It was not shot as Hitchcock did, but was shot as a film, although most of the film takes place in one or two rooms.  The film is successful because of the intensity and passion of O'Neill's script.  This was not adapted for the screen (it would have been a sacrilege) but is lifted almost verbatim from the original with some judicious editing. O'Neill's writing approaches sheer poetry at times and long speeches are never noticed.  Sympathetic characters, and strong performances from the actors make this film a fine film-from-play, whereas ""Rope"" falls flat.",3,Just okay,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1777,"['Hitch', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'allowed', 'dud', 'Obviously', 'Rope', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'original', 'script', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'instead', 'turning', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'technique', 'filming', 'movie', 'were', 'play', 'done', 'AFT', 'television', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'really', 'work', 'Film', 'theater', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'mediums', 'require', 'very', 'different', 'treatments', 'take', 'film', 'direct', 'were', 'play', 'film', 'unique', 'qualities', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'play', 'sense', 'lack', 'music', 'long', 'speeches', 'use', 'mainly', 'one', 'set', 'play', 'not', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'film', 'Compulsion', 'also', 'based', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'case', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'great', 'performance', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'See', 'film', 'instead.And', 'acting', 'be', 'much', 'overacting', 'can', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'stage', 'projection', 'forcefulness', 'However', 'screen', 'performances', 'even', 'are', 'directed', 'were', 'play', 'demand', 'more', 'subtle', 'subdued', 'performances', 'plays', 'make', 'successful', 'transition', 'film', ""O'Neill"", 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'feel', 'made', 'good', 'transition', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'shot', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'two', 'rooms', 'film', 'successful', 'intensity', 'passion', ""O'Neill"", 'script', 'was', 'not', 'adapted', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sacrilege', 'lifted', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'original', 'judicious', 'editing', ""O'Neill"", 'writing', 'approaches', 'sheer', 'poetry', 'times', 'long', 'speeches', 'are', 'never', 'noticed', 'Sympathetic', 'characters', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'fine', 'film-from-play', 'Rope', 'flat']",N/A

So begins this film, really a stage play, brought to the screen by Hitchcock.  Meet Phillip (ably played by Farley Granger) & Brandon (John Dall), a man who later declares in conversation that ""I'd hang all the incompetents and fools anyway.  They're far too many in the world.""  These are our murderers, two spolied prep boys, ""men of such intellectual and cultural superiority that they are above the traditional moral concepts.""  As Brandon explains to his guests over drinks, ""Good & evil, right & wrong were invented for the ordinary average man, the inferior man, because he needs them.""  Mind you (and I'm not giving anything away here, as it takes place in the first few minutes of the film) all this conversation takes place not 10 feet from their victim's body lying dead in a serving chest.  That, in a nutshell (so to speak) is what this film is all about.  In short, it's a macabre---one (bad) joke---story that just drags you along for an hour or so; as you are begged to wonder what is going to happen.  Will the victim's father (one of half a dozen guests at this drinks party) discover his son's body?  Will his girlfriend (as she tries to make idle awkward conversation with her former flame, a surprise guest---the victim's best friend)?  Other players on hand include Jimmy Stewart as the prep boys' former professor, an aunt of the victim, and a housekeeper---who wanders around opening lots of things, trying to rachet up the suspense of this film.  Unfortunately,  the ending is not nearly as dramatic as your imagination might suggest.  The last 20 minutes thus builds and builds---thanks to Jimmy Stewart really ( who calls the party ""peculiar"" early on), but also to Mr. Granger's sweating (once Stewart begins badgering him), and then it's over in an uneventful flash.  John Dall plays the cool calculating murderer, so along with Granger we get treated to aspects of the typical dual personality of a murderer, but in this film it's just split into two bodies.  That and the proximity of the victim's body to all the associated guests are the only interesting things about this play, actually.  Unfortunately, making it into a film seems to have hindered it or at least added nothing to it.

Different than horror, the audience looks for elongated moments of tension, created by increased curiosity. But this whole genre should  be tributed to Alfred Hitchcock, who told us that one's nerves could be tested to unconventional limits without the showing of blood-sucking vampires, or slice-and-dicing killers.The whole movie, but the whole of it, is acted in a single room: a living room. That may seem odd at first. However, the acting is done so well, that you won't be thinking of that detail as the suspense climbs on. The film is about two young gentlemen, who have a hard time hiding their victim in a closed chest at the time when they have guests at home. The feeling of guilt, as in all Hitchcock movies, will cause our main characters to feel uncomfortable and at stress, which will cause tension among the other characters and them.'Rope' may not have many modern techniques that we are used to nowadays; but it definitely provides the suspense elements, that contemporary suspense films are based onto.

203852,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6300183580,calvinnme,"[4, 5]","This obscure movie has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films. In my opinion, it marks the beginning of the golden era of largely flawless Hitchcock films that runs for 15 years through the release of ""The Birds"" in 1963.The movie is based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, inspired by the Leopold-Loeb case. The film follows two young men, in one apartment, on one night, as they throw a dinner party for a bunch of people that were close friends of both themselves and a third young man they have just murdered for no reason other than to have experienced the act of doing so. For the added thrill, they throw the victim's body into a chest from which they serve their guests their buffet dinner.The dinner guests include David's father, who is making constant references to how he is worried about how his only child is missing when David doesn't turn up where he is supposed to, and how his wife, David's mother, is most consumed with worry. Janet, David's current girlfriend, is also invited, as is Janet's old boyfriend. These two interact very awkwardly, to the delight of their murderous hosts, until the end of the party. Janet explains to her old flame how she took up with David because of love, not because of his money, and when her old boyfriend sees that Janet genuinely cares for David, the two reach a truce. The point of all of this conversation at the party is to show that David - as is true with all human beings - isn't some inferior lab rat that the two murderers had the right to exterminate as a means of spending an otherwise boring afternoon. He is a human, as important as any other, who has people who care about him and will obviously mourn his death.James Stewart is great as the murderers' former teacher, Rupert, who solves the mystery that the two killers have pretty much dared him to discover and solve. Hitchcock was always able to direct James Stewart to play just about any role he could dream up without letting Stewart's ""every man"" quality get in the way of the quality and believability of his performance. It is interesting to note that at the end of the film, from James Stewart's final speech to the two murderers, that we assume the pair will be tried for murder and executed. Some people don't know that although Leopold and Loeb - the inspiration for this film - were sentenced to life in prison for their crime, that Leopold was released on parole in 1958 after serving 33 years, and lived another 13 years in freedom before his death. Loeb was killed by another inmate in the 1930's, otherwise he would have likely been paroled eventually, too. Since Leopold and Loeb killed a child rather than another adult, we can't really be sure what would have become of Hitchcock's two murderers had this been a real life situation.The one thing that did surprise me was on the commentary, when it was mentioned that the two murdering college students were homosexuals, and that Hitchcock pushed the envelope on inuendos on this subject just as far as he thought the censors would let him. Maybe I'm just dense, but I never got that vibe out of the movie at all, until I was told that it existed in the first place.""Rope"" is just a little over an hour long, and is performed entirely in one room of one apartment. It is a psychological thriller, not one of Hitchcock's action thrillers. It's definitely worthwhile for any Hitchcock fan, but it might disappoint someone who buys this without knowing the movie's format and is expecting something like ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" or ""North by Northwest"". If you want to watch ""Rope"", but don't want to buy it on a DVD dedicated just to it, you might consider purchasing ""Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection"".

Based on a stage play of the same name, at Hitchcock's insistence, this was filmed as closely as possible to replicate the play. The action takes place at a dinner party.The plot involves two extremely intelligent college students(Farley Granger and John Dall) who have strangled a classmate with a rope and stored the victim's body in a trunk. Because this is Hitchcock, he no doubt delighted that the trunk was being used as a dining table. In a subtle but increasingly tense dialogue that runs along the Nietzsche theory of man vs superman, their guest ( a college professor played by Jimmy Stewart) engages in the conversation and gradually comes to the realization of what has occurred and that the missing guest of honor is present but not in the way normally presented.This movie was not successful when originally released, and I suspect that has a lot to do with the way it was filmed which closely resembles a stage play. While there are subtle breaks in the action, they are incidental and do little to interrupt the action. The overall effect is very much like watching a play and I don't think audiences were prepared for that.This is a crisp transfer from a clear master copy.

That includes Alfred Hitchcock's films, which I loved in the '50s and '60s.John Dall, who went on to ""cult status"" fame with ""Gun Crazy"" (a.k.a.

I really liked all the character portrayals in this film. Murderers Granger and Dall exhibit just the right mix of ""Will we get caught?"" angst and the cockiness and sheer gall of those that murder simply for the sport of it.Although not one of the ""higher profile"" Alfred Hitchcock entries, I think ""Rope"" is, in fact, one of his better films.  It's certainly unique, style-wise, being filmed in ten-minute, continuous takes, giving it a ""seamless"" uninterrupted look.There has been much talk about the supposed ""homosexual overtones"" between the two murderers in ""Rope"". Now while I know this to be the director's intention, if I hadn't read about it after seeing the movie, I would never have thought those two male characters were supposed to be homosexual.  In my view, *nothing* that is said or done in the film particularly points to this conclusion. I suppose it's designed to be there, but ""just beneath the surface"".  But, I looked at the two killers as merely being close friends. I don't really know why the sexual orientation subject even has to enter into it. And, really, it *doesn't*.""Rope"" is unique in another fashion as well -- Hitchcock's ""cameo"".  Unique because we get not one, but TWO, ""Hitch"" cameos in this picture.  Right after the opening credits, we see Alfred walking on the sidewalk below. With cameo appearance #2 (which was originally intended to be his lone cameo) coming 55 minutes into the fairly-short 80-minute film. This second cameo is not of Hitchcock ""in the flesh"".  Instead, the director inserted the image of a flashing neon sign outside one of the windows of the apartment. This sign depicts the famous Hitchcock ""profile"".  A very inventive cameo indeed (rivaling his ""newspaper"" appearance in ""Lifeboat"" for the most creative, IMO).As with a much-later Hitchcock picture, ""The Birds"", ""Rope"" has no music score to aid the story and move it along (save the opening theme music and the piano-playing of Farley Granger's character). An entire movie void of music is something that I don't imagine too many directors could pull off.  But Hitchcock, in ""Rope"" and ""The Birds"" (which was fifteen years later), did it quite successfully.This Universal single-disc DVD offers up a fine-looking and very clear Full Frame picture (1.33:1 aspect ratio).  Colors do look a tad dated, though. But, overall, ""Rope"" looks excellent here!  The soundtrack on the disc is in Mono (Dolby Digital 2.0).The disc's Menu system is simplistic and easy to use (which is OK by me).  When the Main Menu is on screen, the theme from Hitch's TV series, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", plays.  This is nice, but I wonder why they didn't use the ""Rope"" opening theme music for the Menu?Although not officially labelled as one of Universal's ""Collector's Editions"", this ""Rope"" DVD could very well have been so designated.  This disc has very nearly as many Special Features as the other Hitchcock ""Collector's"" packages.  Here's a gander at the ""Rope"" bonus supplements .................>> A 32-minute documentary, ""Rope Unleashed"", covering the making of this motion picture.  Included here is an interview with actor/writer Hume Cronyn, who collaborated on the ""Rope"" screenplay.  Sadly, not too very long after filming the interview for this DVD, Mr. Cronyn passed away, in June 2003.  Many backstage pictures are mixed in with the interview segments, including some eye-opening pics of the color camera equipment of the era.  Color cameras during those days were more than ""bulky"" -- those babies were humongous! And via some still photos we can see just how cumbersome those cameras were, circa 1948.>> The Original Theatrical Trailer for ""Rope"". -- I absolutely love this unique trailer.  It really (in a way) serves as a ""deleted scene"" from the movie. And shows us the film's murder victim (""David Kentley"") before he falls prey to his killers' rope.  The trailer has David (played by Dick Hogan) and his fiancee, Janet (Joan Chandler), sitting on a park bench, talking about their upcoming engagement.  It's just a short scene, but sets up some of the plot points very nicely in just a few seconds. After David kisses his betrothed and leaves the park, this becomes more of a ""conventional"" trailer, with star Jimmy Stewart appearing on camera to narrate. Video quality for this color trailer is a bit splotchy and blurry in places, but still certainly in watchable condition. I think the introduction of the murder victim in this ""added"" scene was a very clever idea by the filmmakers. Trailer length = 2:25.>> A very nice Photo Gallery (which has many behind-the-camera images).>> Some text screens with film notes and cast bios. (There's a kind of funny little mistake in the DVD's bio of John Dall. Dall's character is referred to as ""Shaw Brandon"" on the text screen, instead of the correct name, ""Brandon Shaw"".)Alfred Hitchcock directed more than 50 films -- with ""Rope"", his first venture into the world of ""Technicolor"", resting among my personal ""Top 10 Hitch Flicks"".

He, after all, was the instigator of the dastardly deed done by two unpleasant fools.  Were they gay guys? I couldn't tell?  Is being gay supposed to make them stupid?  Jimmy had blabbed on and on when he was their teacher or something in an expensive un-named prep school in New England  on how the superior people of the world have every right to kill the inferior people.  He even ran on about it in front of us while sitting on the sofa.  But hey...that was just irony or something.  Ole Jimmy didn't ACTUALLY MEAN IT.  HE JUST SAID IT TO BE CUTE.  A great performance is given by Cedric Hardwick as the Dad of the unfortunate victim.  The other actors also played their roles well.  Then..Ole Jimmy wonders where the victim is and as he is VERY INTELLIGENT he hangs around and follows clues and discovers the corpse.  The boys tell him why they did it and Jimmy gets on his High Horse...You is bad boys!  and its very funny how Jimmy shoots bullets out the window of a NYC skyscraper to get the police to come.  Very confusing message:  Jimmy is his usually honey lovey self...the gay boys are burdened with all the blame.

The production of the work is as if on a stage--a play in the making--providing nearly continuous action from start to finish. Can Brandon and Philip pull off the perfect murder?

203865,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6300183580,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","The scariest kind of murder is not the murder of passion, or even cold-blooded greed -- it's the murder that is committed for its own sake.And such a murder is the center of ""Rope,"" one of Alfred Hitchcock's more experimental movies. Based on the real-life murder committed by  Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, nearly the entire movie takes place in real time in a single room. Most impressively, there are only a few cuts, allowing the camera to wander through the story as if an invisible man was observing everything.The story begins with murder -- a young man named David is strangled by his former classmates, law students Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger). Then they stuff his corpse in a big wooden chest. Brandon wants to commit the ""perfect"" murder that proves their intellectual superiority, and as superior beings they are exempt from the morals that govern society -- an idea he got from his former teacher, Rupert (James Stewart).They plan to dump the body in a lake later that evening, but first Brandon wants to put the final perverse ""artistic"" flourish -- he's going to host a dinner party, with the corpse-containing chest used as a buffet. Even worse, the guests include David's father and aunt, Rupert, David's fiancee, Janet Walker (Joan Chandler) and her ex-boyfriend Kenneth  (Douglas Dick).But as the evening goes on, the guests begin to worry when David doesn't show up, and Rupert begins to suspect that something weird is going on. An increasingly hysterical Phillip begins to unravel out of fear that their ""artistic"" murder will be found out, and a confrontation between the three men becomes inevitable.Reportedly Alfred Hitchcock was not entirely satisfied with ""Rope,"" considering it an experiment that didn't quite succeed. Frankly, I find it a fascinating piece of work, both artistically and thematically -- how often do you see a movie where the camera simply pans quietly through the room, focusing on different people and conversations as it goes? And yes, it's in real time.In fact, at some points it stops feeling like a MOVIE, and more like you're an invisible person standing in the room observing everything silently. Or perhaps, since it takes place mostly in one room, it's more like watching a play where you can wander onstage among the actors.It's also rather experimental in its chilling theme. Most people have expressed some sort of radical, cruel views in the past, but here Hitchcock asks what would happen if someone actually took those views to heart? And the scariest part is this is based in reality -- Leopold and Loeb truly believed themselves to be &Uuml;bermenschen.So Hitchcock amps up the suspense and horror as the unwitting people circle around the corpse, eating food from atop his unofficial coffin and worrying about his absence. One of the most intense scenes is Rupert casually discussing how he supports murder of ""inferior"" people... and the whole time, you're acutely aware that his students have actually put this into practice. It leads to a beautifully harrowing scene when Rupert realizes the monsters he has helped create through his own careless insensitivity.It also has main characters that you can't really feel any sympathy for. Brandon is one of the most repulsive characters you could ever find -- a cheery, casual psychopath who toys with David's loved ones for his own sadistic amusement. Phillip, on the other hand, is a neurotic wimp who is too weak to say ""no"" to his boyfriend, even about murder. Grange and Dahl are absolutely amazing in their roles, and they really elicit your loathing for the characters they play.However, there is one flaw: James Stewart. Stewart was one of the greatest actors in Hollywood, but here he's woefully miscast -- he seems uncomfortable with playing a casually cruel academic who doesn't seem to ""get"" the implications of his theories, so often Rupert sounds like he's joking when he isn't. Stewart is brilliant when he turns on the intensity, but he doesn't do it often enough.It's a sharp deviation from Hitchcock's ""typical"" style, but ""Rope is a horrifyingly effective experience anyway -- chilling, odd and strangely ""real."" The only problem is Stewart's casting.",4,A tale of murder,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,4220,"['scariest', 'kind', 'murder', 'not', 'murder', 'passion', 'even', 'cold-blooded', 'greed', 'murder', 'committed', 'own', 'sake.And', 'murder', 'center', 'Rope', 'one', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'more', 'experimental', 'movies', 'Based', 'real-life', 'murder', 'committed', 'Nathan', 'Leopold', 'Richard', 'Loeb', 'nearly', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'single', 'room', 'Most', 'impressively', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'cuts', 'allowing', 'camera', 'wander', 'story', 'invisible', 'man', 'was', 'observing', 'everything.The', 'story', 'murder', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'David', 'strangled', 'former', 'classmates', 'law', 'students', 'Brandon', 'Shaw', 'John', 'Dall', 'Phillip', 'Morgan', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'Then', 'stuff', 'corpse', 'big', 'wooden', 'chest', 'Brandon', 'commit', 'perfect', 'murder', 'intellectual', 'superiority', 'superior', 'beings', 'are', 'exempt', 'morals', 'govern', 'society', 'idea', 'got', 'former', 'teacher', 'Rupert', 'James', 'Stewart', '.They', 'plan', 'dump', 'body', 'lake', 'later', 'evening', 'first', 'Brandon', 'put', 'final', 'perverse', 'artistic', 'flourish', 'going', 'host', 'dinner', 'party', 'corpse-containing', 'chest', 'used', 'buffet', 'Even', 'worse', 'guests', 'include', 'David', 'father', 'aunt', 'Rupert', 'David', 'fiancee', 'Janet', 'Walker', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Kenneth', 'Douglas', 'Dick', '.But', 'evening', 'guests', 'begin', 'worry', 'when', 'David', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Rupert', 'suspect', 'something', 'weird', 'going', 'increasingly', 'hysterical', 'Phillip', 'unravel', 'fear', 'artistic', 'murder', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'confrontation', 'three', 'men', 'inevitable.Reportedly', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'Rope', 'considering', 'experiment', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'Frankly', 'find', 'fascinating', 'piece', 'work', 'artistically', 'thematically', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'camera', 'simply', 'quietly', 'room', 'focusing', 'different', 'people', 'conversations', 'yes', 'real', 'time.In', 'fact', 'points', 'feeling', 'MOVIE', 'more', ""'re"", 'invisible', 'person', 'standing', 'room', 'observing', 'everything', 'silently', 'perhaps', 'place', 'mostly', 'one', 'room', 'more', 'watching', 'play', 'where', 'can', 'wander', 'onstage', 'actors.It', 'also', 'rather', 'experimental', 'chilling', 'theme', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'expressed', 'sort', 'radical', 'cruel', 'views', 'past', 'here', 'Hitchcock', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'someone', 'actually', 'took', 'views', 'heart', 'scariest', 'part', 'based', 'reality', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'truly', 'believed', 'be', 'Uuml', 'bermenschen.So', 'Hitchcock', 'up', 'suspense', 'horror', 'unwitting', 'people', 'circle', 'corpse', 'eating', 'food', 'unofficial', 'coffin', 'worrying', 'absence', 'One', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'Rupert', 'casually', 'discussing', 'how', 'murder', 'inferior', 'people', 'whole', 'time', ""'re"", 'acutely', 'aware', 'students', 'have', 'actually', 'put', 'practice', 'beautifully', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'when', 'Rupert', 'monsters', 'helped', 'create', 'own', 'careless', 'insensitivity.It', 'also', 'main', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Brandon', 'one', 'most', 'repulsive', 'characters', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'cheery', 'casual', 'psychopath', 'who', 'David', 'loved', 'ones', 'own', 'sadistic', 'amusement', 'Phillip', 'other', 'hand', 'neurotic', 'wimp', 'who', 'too', 'weak', 'say', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'murder', 'Grange', 'Dahl', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'roles', 'really', 'elicit', 'loathing', 'characters', 'play.However', 'one', 'flaw', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Stewart', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'here', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'uncomfortable', 'playing', 'casually', 'cruel', 'academic', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'implications', 'theories', 'so', 'often', 'Rupert', 'joking', 'when', ""n't"", 'Stewart', 'brilliant', 'when', 'intensity', ""n't"", 'do', 'often', 'enough.It', 'sharp', 'deviation', 'Hitchcock', 'typical', 'style', 'Rope', 'horrifyingly', 'effective', 'experience', 'anyway', 'chilling', 'odd', 'strangely', 'real', 'only', 'problem', 'Stewart', 'casting']",N/A

The cast is too credible to allow us much amusement from the sophisticated double entrendres of the central crime.  Hitchcock's later mastery of black comedy may have been able to make something more palatable of the script.  As it is, Dall and Granger create a kind of duet of arrogance and dread that's adeptly played, but unsettling to watch.  (Cedric Hardwick's turn as the victim's compassionate father also make it difficult to take much enjoyment in the goings on.)

There's no blood or gore, so the disturbance comes from the heartlessness of the men doing the killing.  The taking of another human life is treated as if it were nothing.In the opening shot, you know who the killers are, so this isn't a whodunnit film.  The acting by the lead killer is so well done, I walked away from this film wondering if this actor was a psychopath in real life. He has no regard for human life at all.  He sees the killing as an opportunity to play a sick joke on the victim's family and friends.  His accomplice, in the meantime, is scared out of his wits.Jimmy Stewart plays an old professor of the two killers and midway through the film, echoes the thoughts running through the killers' minds.  Stewart dismisses the morals of society that govern against murder and speaks as if you should feel superior to them.  But this presented a problem in the film for me.Later, when he finds out his words inspired these men to kill, he accuses them of twisting his words around.  But I heard his words.

I haven't seen all the Hitchcock movies, but I hypothesize that this is the only Hitchcock film where you don't have a leading lady along with a leading man. Perhaps, that will explain the lack of success of this Hitchcock film. After all, the great director always had to have a great leading lady and some good romance.Along with many of his other great films, Hitchcock reveals the shallowness and superficiality of middle-class culture, as revealed by the stupidity of these two pseudo-intellectuals who misread Nietzche, to the chagrin of a person's life. Brandon and Phillip twist the philosopher's words only to cover up what they really wanted to do all along. Shallowness is also shown to us through the party. This party works as a facade. Not only does it work to cover up a crime, but it also shows other cover ups. Why is it that Janet wants to marry David? Is she really in love with him? Throughout her presence, we can see a lot of ambiguity in her words, as well as in her gestures. There is plenty of shallowness and superficiality in the small talk of the guests, especially, David's aunt, whom refers to the horoscope and does some hand-reading to say ironic things (stressing the more on how ignorant is she about what's really going on beneath the surface). Apparently, Rupert is the only character who can read beyond the surfaces, catching the nuances of Brandon's and Phillip's nervous behavior and speech, he makes fun on small talk about the movies by Mrs. Atwater. And one can also read between the lines of his words toward Janet, ""Do you deserve justice?""Following this line of thought, one may argue that the film tries to reveal what is underneath social conventions. A party about books is not really about books; marriages are not about love; Harvard graduates are not different from the average person; and middle-class people are not more intelligent than the maid, who also percieves that something funny is going on. The film begins with an exterior shot, which shows a world of safetiness and order (a cop helps a little boy cross a street). But under this appearance of tranquility, behind the closed curtains, there is something dark and sinister taking place. This beginning serves well as a framework to the film. Interestingly, at the very end, when Rupert makes his discovery, instead of calling the police on the phone, he opens the window and shoots to let the world in the room. The noises, the voices, and all the sounds coming into the room is as if Rupert had broken the distance between the surface and what goes on under it.Looking at it from this perspective, this film is brilliantly done. And it doesn;t depart from Hitchcock's tradition of works, except for the lack of a leading lady.",4,Shallowness,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,2952,"['may', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'as', 'great', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Catch', 'A', 'Thief', 'Vertigo', 'Dial', 'M', 'Stage', 'Fright', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'finding', 'compelling', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'aforementioned', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'hypothesize', 'only', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'leading', 'lady', 'leading', 'man', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'explain', 'lack', 'success', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'great', 'director', 'always', 'had', 'have', 'great', 'leading', 'lady', 'good', 'romance.Along', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'shallowness', 'superficiality', 'middle-class', 'culture', 'revealed', 'stupidity', 'two', 'pseudo-intellectuals', 'who', 'misread', 'Nietzche', 'chagrin', 'person', 'life', 'Brandon', 'Phillip', 'twist', 'philosopher', 'words', 'only', 'cover', 'up', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'along', 'Shallowness', 'also', 'shown', 'party', 'party', 'facade', 'Not', 'only', 'work', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'also', 'other', 'cover', 'ups', 'Why', 'Janet', 'marry', 'David', 'really', 'love', 'presence', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'ambiguity', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'gestures', 'plenty', 'shallowness', 'superficiality', 'small', 'talk', 'guests', 'especially', 'David', 'aunt', 'whom', 'refers', 'horoscope', 'hand-reading', 'say', 'ironic', 'things', 'stressing', 'more', 'how', 'ignorant', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'surface', 'Apparently', 'Rupert', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'surfaces', 'catching', 'nuances', 'Brandon', 'Phillip', 'nervous', 'behavior', 'speech', 'fun', 'small', 'talk', 'movies', 'Mrs.', 'Atwater', 'one', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'lines', 'words', 'Janet', 'Do', 'deserve', 'justice', 'Following', 'line', 'thought', 'one', 'may', 'argue', 'film', 'tries', 'reveal', 'what', 'underneath', 'social', 'conventions', 'A', 'party', 'books', 'not', 'really', 'books', 'marriages', 'are', 'not', 'love', 'Harvard', 'graduates', 'are', 'not', 'different', 'average', 'person', 'middle-class', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'intelligent', 'maid', 'who', 'also', 'something', 'funny', 'going', 'film', 'exterior', 'shot', 'world', 'safetiness', 'order', 'cop', 'little', 'boy', 'cross', 'street', 'appearance', 'tranquility', 'closed', 'curtains', 'something', 'dark', 'sinister', 'taking', 'place', 'beginning', 'serves', 'well', 'framework', 'film', 'Interestingly', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Rupert', 'discovery', 'instead', 'calling', 'police', 'phone', 'window', 'shoots', 'let', 'world', 'room', 'noises', 'voices', 'sounds', 'coming', 'room', 'Rupert', 'had', 'broken', 'distance', 'surface', 'what', 'it.Looking', 'perspective', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'done', 't', 'depart', 'Hitchcock', 'tradition', 'works', 'lack', 'leading', 'lady']",N/A

203871,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,6300183580,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[5, 6]","Alfred Hitchcock's first color movie, ""Rope,"" explores a rare but disturbing motivation for murder: mere thought. As history - twentieth century history in particular - demonstrates, monstrous acts sometimes originate from ideas. A mere synaptic spark within the wrong psychological framework may translate into a skull fractured by a bullet, a deep wound occupied by a knife, or a genocidal extermination by a governing body. Human neural pathways, as varied as snowflakes, manifest these dangerous ideas in innumerable ways. Most fizzle within the guilty brains that formed them, impotent as wet matchbooks. Others, unfortunately, manage to find a conduit into the eye-for-an-eye realm of action. In such cases, concepts seem to murder. Imagination becomes brutal reality. ""Rope"" examines, via its morally diverse cast, both sides of this thorny fence.A thriller in reverse, the movie begins with a murder. Following the opening street scene, across which Hitchcock struts, the camera hones in on a curtain-clad window. Then a scream. Inside, David Kently's body goes limp. Brandown Shaw and Phillip Morgan check for signs of life before uncoiling the thick rope around David's neck. After a brief period of shock Brandon resounds with pride, as if he had just reached the summit of Everest or bagged his dream job. Phillip remains distant, querulous, and shaky. Placing the murder minutes after the opening titles compels the viewer to focus on motivation. The act of killing gets de-emphasized. Something subtler tugs at this narrative thread.More shocking than the strangulation is the party Brandon has planned. People will arrive at the scene of the crime, a beautiful apartment that breathtakingly overlooks downtown New York, soon. Brandon begins to rhapsodize about superiority. Weeding out of the weak, the responsibility of superior beings, etc. He rattles off a litany of social Darwinism derived from misunderstandings of Nietzsche. These ideas, the basis of David's killing, become prime suspects. And David, now hidden in the large chest that will soon provide the party's centerpiece, gets condemned as one of the ""weaklings."" The unknowing housemaid sets the food on top of the chest that contains the corpse. Brandon sees this as the icing on the cake. Phillip broods like a guilty child.As the party picks up the question ""where's David"" occurs with increasing frequency. No one seems to know. David's fiancee arrives. So does her ex-boyfriend. Neither are pleased. Frustration builds. Finally, Brandon and Philip's inspiration, Rupert Cadell, played by a mesmerizing Jimmy Stewart in his first Hitchcock role, shows up. He comes across as intimidating and brash. Someone tells him, ""it's good to see you again."" He responds coldly, ""why?"" Brandon brings up ""the perfect murder"" and his beliefs about superiority. Rupert agrees with everything. He even adds in some bone-chilling nuances of his own. David's father, also an invitee, protests and demands that they stop their macabre conversation. He doesn't even want to hear the theories that Brandon finds so engaging. As if speech somehow bestows validity on ideas. As if ideas could somehow kill. Rupert becomes suspicious, which boils over when, upon his exit, the housemaid accidentally gives him a hat embossed with ""DK"" inside. David's hat. Rupert confronts the now nervous, and dangerous, duo.The last ten minutes of the film contain indescribable tension. A gun appears. Ultimate control of the situation depends on its possessor. It changes hands a few times. Rupert sees and hears the consequences of the ideas he once fed Brandon. Reeling, he decides that morality depends on more than concepts. Something mysterious and ineffable bubbles under reprehensible acts. He tells Brandon ""There's something deep down inside of you that would allow you to do this, just as there's something deep down inside of me that wouldn't allow it."" And then Rupert's clincher, the movie's superquote: ""Did you think you were God, Brandon?"" Rupert's utterance, which probably had a different resonance for a 1948 audience, restores moral homeostasis. The line slashes Brandon's pretentions like a cutlass through yogurt. By juxtaposing Brandon's action with Rupert's inaction, the movie seems to say that belief in monstrous ideas does not imply a carrying out of reprehensible deeds. Instead, monstrous people, rife with amoral ""stuff,"" that ""something"" Rupert alluded to, remain the problem. Ideas are off the hook. The film thus reveals a sticky, unanswerable question about human nature. If ideas produce different reactions in different people, then how do amoral acts arise?In the final scene of this underrated Hitchcock masterpiece, a gun fires out a window. People stir. Sirens bellow. ""You're going to die!"" someone shouts. But no one in this film will die for mere ideas. Police can't arrest thoughts, and they can't apprehend concepts. ""Rope"" invites a deep reflection on the dichotomy between those that merely think of ideas and those arrestable folks who, unfortunately, decide to act on them.",5,Can ideas kill?,1167523200,"12 31,

Hitchcock decided to make Rope a bit of an experimental film, filmed with one long set, so there are several pauses where the camera actually goes in back of a character. While this was a unique way to create the film, it does have its advantages. Rope seems to play out almost like a ""stage play"" in which the camera is still, but characters move around on the set.  Much like Rear Window, the setting of the film does not move to other spots, but stays right in the very apartment where the murder was committed. Rope is more a psychological thriller about whether the two men will get caught than whether they actually did it, and it examines what goes through the conscious of those who have killed.The murder is committed within moments after the opening credits, as the two friends kill David and then put his body in the very spot where people will later gather for a party. Once the murder is committed, the differences of the two men begin to unfold before the audience. Philip is more passive and nervous about what they have done, and clearly he has second doubts as to what they should do or whether they should have done this at all. His motives come from not being caught, and taking the necessary precautions. As the night wanes on, Phillip becomes more and more paranoid about the murder, and the questions he gets asked by his former school master, Rubert Goodell (James Stewart), who knows something is amiss. Brandon, on the other hand, is Phillip's opposite. Brandon is sly, sneaky, and has a malicious and dark humor throughout. He seems to get a ""thrill"" not only about having committed the murder, but the idea of trying to get away with it, and his callously bold attitude is evidenced as the story unfolds. He cleverly has everything all planned out, and can deflect questions and suspicion with ease. But, will he be able to outwit the equally resourceful Rupert? As more characters show up to the party, things get more and more dicey for the pair, and Rupert smells foul play.The skill in this film is clearly in a superb screenplay. Some viewers might not like the fact that there is little movement, or ""action"", but the exceptional feeling of suspense builds as more and more pieces of the puzzle come to light. The script is quite amazing, and leads to a suspenseful ""cat and mouse"" game between Brandon and Rupert. The last twenty minutes of the film are superbly crafted and written; it is during this part where Hitchcock's genius is evident.Over all, this is a highly overlooked classic from the master of suspense.

Certainly it is his most tightly constricted piece - filled with long takes in near real-time. It's an amazing achievement of controlled tension.The only exterior shot in the film comes during the opening credits. The camera rests on an apartment window with the curtains pulled shut. There is a muffled scream and then suddenly we're inside the apartment where David Kentley is being strangled to death by two of his friends.The movie setting goes internal. It reflects the direction of the film because we're about to get inside the minds, motivations, and the personalities of the characters. We're trapped inside the apartment for good - just like poor, dead David who has been stuffed into a chest.His murderers are two wealthy, intellectual young men named Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Philip Morgan (Farley Granger). They have killed their friend for one reason - to experience the sensation of murder. They want to pull off the perfect crime - and revel in their superiority.To make matters even more horrifying, Brandon and Philip are throwing a dinner party and inviting David's family, his girlfriend (Janet), the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend, and their former academy teacher Rupert (their mentor who has inspired their crime with his misinterpretations of Nietzchian philosophies of the Superman).""Nobody commits a murder just for the experiment of murder,"" Brandon says as he pops a bottle of champagne. ""Nobody except us.""But the celebration isn't what Brandon expects because the heavy weight of their crime begins to crush the more sensitive Philip. Brandon is the cold, charming snob - and a classic sociopath. Philip, however, slowly begins to unravel. He gashes his palm after crushing a wine glass in his hands when David's aunt mistakes another guest for David.But even the cool and calm Brandon has moments of panic. When David's father asks where his son is, Brandon stammers: ""I thought he was coming with you!""Rupert (Jimmy Stewart) doesn't show up until 30 minutes into the film. And once he arrives the film becomes his. Stewart - one of the greatest actors in American history - is amazing in ""Rope."" Personally, he didn't like his performance, but the movie is in essence about the transformation of Rupert - his growth from a bitter cynic into a connected human being. And it works.Here's a peek into Rupert. Introduced to Janet (Joan Chandler):""Ah, Miss Walker,"" he says.""How did you know?"" she asks.""Brandon has spoken of you.""""Did he do me justice?""""Do you deserve justice?"" he asks and then waltzes off with a smirk.The commanding personality of Rupert begins to melt Brandon. He joins Philip as the weight of his crime is reflected back to him in the presence of his mentor.Rupert - a naturally suspicious and cunningly observant man - gets his first thread to pull when Brandon - a game player - serves chicken for dinner. Philip no longer eats chicken after having to strangle one at Brandon's farm. When Brandon tells the story with an evil twinkle in his eye, Philip has an outburst of anger. The scene gives Rupert his first clue and his investigation begins.He comes up with gems like this: ""You're more than unusually allergic to the truth tonight Philip. That's the second time you haven't told it.""Ultimately the keen Rupert finally discovers the grim secret in the bottom of the trunk. It's a chilling scene. The movie ends with Rupert throwing open the apartment window and letting the outside cleanse the inside of the apartment with its noise and voices.And Philip utters the last words of the movie: ""They're coming."" They don't make movies like ""Rope"" anymore. But they should.For more literate blather visit the Dark Party Review ([...])",5,"An Ode to ""Rope"" -- One of Hitchcock's Underrated Best",1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,3952,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rope', '1948', 'claustrophobic', 'masterpiece', 'spiraling', 'descent', 'dark', 'recesses', 'human', 'nature', 'Hitchcock', 'rough', 'edges', 'ego', 'impulse', 'how', 'can', 'lead', 'horrible', 'consequences.It', 'may', 'be', 'Hitchcock', 'greatest', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'most', 'tightly', 'constricted', 'piece', 'filled', 'long', 'real-time', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'controlled', 'tension.The', 'only', 'exterior', 'shot', 'film', 'opening', 'credits', 'camera', 'apartment', 'window', 'curtains', 'pulled', 'shut', 'muffled', 'scream', 'then', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'apartment', 'where', 'David', 'Kentley', 'being', 'strangled', 'death', 'two', 'friends.The', 'movie', 'setting', 'internal', 'direction', 'film', ""'re"", 'get', 'minds', 'motivations', 'personalities', 'characters', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'apartment', 'good', 'just', 'poor', 'dead', 'David', 'who', 'been', 'stuffed', 'chest.His', 'murderers', 'are', 'two', 'wealthy', 'intellectual', 'young', 'men', 'named', 'Brandon', 'Shaw', 'John', 'Dall', 'Philip', 'Morgan', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'have', 'killed', 'friend', 'one', 'reason', 'experience', 'sensation', 'murder', 'want', 'pull', 'off', 'perfect', 'crime', 'revel', 'superiority.To', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'horrifying', 'Brandon', 'Philip', 'are', 'throwing', 'dinner', 'party', 'inviting', 'David', 'family', 'girlfriend', 'Janet', 'girlfriend', 'ex-boyfriend', 'former', 'academy', 'teacher', 'Rupert', 'mentor', 'who', 'inspired', 'crime', 'misinterpretations', 'Nietzchian', 'philosophies', 'Superman', 'Nobody', 'murder', 'just', 'experiment', 'murder', 'Brandon', 'bottle', 'champagne', 'Nobody', 'celebration', ""n't"", 'what', 'Brandon', 'heavy', 'weight', 'crime', 'crush', 'more', 'sensitive', 'Philip', 'Brandon', 'cold', 'charming', 'snob', 'classic', 'sociopath', 'Philip', 'however', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'palm', 'crushing', 'wine', 'glass', 'hands', 'when', 'David', 'aunt', 'guest', 'David.But', 'even', 'cool', 'calm', 'Brandon', 'moments', 'panic', 'When', 'David', 'father', 'where', 'son', 'Brandon', 'stammers', 'thought', 'was', 'coming', 'Rupert', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'once', 'film', 'Stewart', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'American', 'history', 'amazing', 'Rope', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'performance', 'movie', 'essence', 'transformation', 'Rupert', 'growth', 'bitter', 'cynic', 'connected', 'human', 'being', 'works.Here', 'peek', 'Rupert', 'Introduced', 'Janet', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'Ah', 'Miss', 'Walker', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'Brandon', 'spoken', 'Did', 'do', 'justice', 'Do', 'deserve', 'justice', 'then', 'off', 'smirk.The', 'commanding', 'personality', 'Rupert', 'melt', 'Brandon', 'Philip', 'weight', 'crime', 'reflected', 'back', 'presence', 'mentor.Rupert', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'cunningly', 'observant', 'man', 'first', 'thread', 'pull', 'when', 'Brandon', 'game', 'player', 'chicken', 'dinner', 'Philip', 'no', 'longer', 'chicken', 'having', 'strangle', 'one', 'Brandon', 'farm', 'When', 'Brandon', 'story', 'evil', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'Philip', 'outburst', 'anger', 'scene', 'Rupert', 'first', 'clue', 'investigation', 'begins.He', 'up', 'gems', ""'re"", 'more', 'unusually', 'allergic', 'truth', 'tonight', 'Philip', 'second', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'told', 'Ultimately', 'keen', 'Rupert', 'finally', 'grim', 'secret', 'bottom', 'trunk', 'chilling', 'scene', 'movie', 'Rupert', 'throwing', 'open', 'apartment', 'window', 'letting', 'outside', 'cleanse', 'inside', 'apartment', 'noise', 'voices.And', 'Philip', 'last', 'words', 'movie', ""'re"", 'coming', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'Rope', 'anymore', 'should.For', 'more', 'literate', 'blather', 'visit', 'Dark', 'Party', 'Review', '[', ']']",N/A

It plays out a little like something from the stage (because it was based on a play) and the action moves along in real time.  This only allows Hitch to build the suspense in the wake of the two students' murder of a classmate to the breaking point.  The score, with the musical number being &quot;practiced&quot; by one of the murderers during the dinner party as its centerpiece, gets faster &amp; more jarring as things thicken, exposing some of the deepere motives behind these &quot;intellectual&quot; killers.  This pairs well with the filming style mentioned here before, these long takes carefully overlaid, the most famous part of which is shot through a swinging kitchen door while farley Granger is dropping a piece of rope, the murder weapon, into a drawer.There is a bit of both purposeful and today inadvertant comic relief in this film, the former through a prudish, wheedling maid, and the latter by the utter hilarity of the way these &quot;college kids&quot; live &amp; throw a party, with champagne &amp; suits.  Perhaps it'd be more popular today if it could be updated - their lives seem out of touch with reality.  Also, I can't have been the only one to catch the dominant / submissive nature of the roommate-killers' relationship, almost directly implicit of homosexuality but vague enough to avoid the censors - the same feint is pulled by Hitch with James Mason &amp; Martin Landau in North by Northwest.If you're a film history buff, you'll love the uniqueness of this Hitch film and appreciate having the first pairing of him and Stewart for film, as the philosophy professor who finds to his horror that it's his ideas that inspired these men to kill.  Farley Granger is also deliciously evil, not unlike the vicious Ray Milland in Dial M for Murder, another set-piece based on a play Hitch adapted for cinema.  The rest of the cast is mainly composed of stock characters.  The funny thing with Rope is that from the beginning you know how it's going to play out, but the great part is watching it actually happen.

The actors had to be careful to step over them without breaking their movement.  Furniture, walls, etc., had to be slid in and out to make a path for the monster.

203883,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,6300183580,Hal Jordan,"[3, 12]","It's evident from the reviews that this is love it or hate it film.  Unfortunately, while I don't think it's quite as bad as some of the other reviewers do, I would say it is a failure.  As you probably know, this was Hitchcock's first color film, and he tried the experiment of filming it in as close to one continuous take as he could.  Apparently in those days the technicolor film had to be changed about every 12 minutes (the Amazon reviewer says 10 minutes), so he needed to use tricks, such as focusing on a character's dark suit jacket to disguise the breaks.  Generally, this is handled well, although a couple of times, coming out of the break the characters are not quite in their previous positions.The film has a number of major problems.  Farley Granger is decent, but not nearly as good as in ""Strangers on a Train"" where, in a somewhat similar role, he was paired with Robert Walker.  Here he plays opposite John Dall, who lacks the creepy intensity that made Walker so good.  Even the ever-reliable Jimmy Stewart is at best mediocre.  He appears to walk very stiffly, which makes me wonder whether he had suffered a back or neck injury prior to the start of shooting.  The film is set entirely in Granger and Dall's apartment, with most of the action taking place in their living room.  Unfortunately, the living room has windows that are supposed to be overlooking the New York skyline.  The skyline is quite obviously a painting, which given how much of the background it takes up is quite distracting.  Frankly, I've seen high school productions with better sets.  As the day fades to night, lights begin blinking in the ""skyscrapers,"" but the effect is so unrealistic as to be comical.Finally, the plot [WARNING:  SPOILER ALERT] has some glaring problems.  (Actually, this is not much of a spoiler because the murder takes place right at the opening of the film.)  The film is based on the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder, where a young boy was killed so L and L could pull off the ""perfect crime.""  Here, Granger and Dall also try to pull off a perfect crime, but their scheme is laughable.  They have a friend come to their apartment just before a party and then strangle him, put him in a box in their living room, and proceed with the party.  How on earth could they have expected to get away with it?  If the victim had mentioned to anyone that he was on his way to visit them, or if anyone had seen him enter the building, or heard the scream he gives out when being strangled, they would have been caught.  It's also never explained how they intend to get the victim out of their apartment, although Stewart mentions that they waited until night time so they wouldn't be seen.  But the hallways and lobby of their apartment building would have been lighted and carrying a dead body through them without being detected would have taken some doing.  The film is based on a play by Patrick Hamilton.  I don't know whether the play also had this huge plot hole, but if so, you would think Hitchcock would have insisted on its being fixed before making the film.  Finally, Dall decides to get fancy by using the murder rope to tie up some books that he gives to the victim's father.  I know this is 1948, but even then it must have been possible to find some of the victim's flesh on the rope.  In attempting the perfect crime, destroying that rope would have been a high priority.This being a Hitchcock film, there are some good touches, including the scene where the maid slowly clears plates and dishes from the box containing the body, while the other characters are deep in conversation, and nearly opens it before being stopped.

Still, I have to say thank God it was only an hour and a half; not that its premise gets old quickly, but any premise is bound to age considerably over the course of a single, hour-and-a-half-long scene.Basically - in a scenario _very_ loosely based on the Leopold-Loeb murder case - two young men murder a third and put his body in a trunk, minutes before hosting a dinner party, and they use the trunk as their table to serve the guests. Among these guests are the parents of the murdered boy, and a canny old teacher of theirs (played by Jimmy Stewart) who proves to be a threat. The gimmick is that the film seems to be shot in a single, fluid take; it's as though the audience isn't allowed to look away from this grotesque happening. Hitchcock used various tricks to disguise reel changes and so on.Rope does have many weaknesses. The script is very good but not quite dynamic enough, considering that the movie is really all script, moving from one dialogue to another, mostly in a single room. Also, Jimmy Stewart's final monologue is a disaster far surpassing the idiot psychoanalyst's expostion in Psycho, making you want to slap him and destroying most of the film's emotional impact. Still, I can't give it less than four stars, just because it's such a unique and conceptually brilliant film.

They kill him for the trills, excitement, and for superiority. But, that's not where these two psychopaths end, and afterwards throw a party. They invite friends including David's family.The party is supposed to be a going away party for one of the murderers and for David's father. And they eat and place food on top of the chest with David's dead body in it. Sounds crazy.Jimmy Stewart plays Rupert, a professor at the party who suspects something. And when David doesn't show up to the party, everyone gets suspicious and one of the murderers gets nervous and starts acting strangely. But, Rupert is the most suspicious.The movie is so fascinating and original because it takes place the whole time in an apartement room. You never leave it.The acting is wonderful with everyone convincing for their parts.The movie also has suspense because of these psychopaths.

In this case, he's dealing with unmotivated murder, as he follows in near-real-time the diabolical exploits of two college students who slay one of their peers and then stage a dinner party merely to examine their guests' suspicions over the man's absence - all of this for the sake of carrying some radical academic theorizing into full practice. As the principal photography is comprised of only a dozen or so shots, the cuts between them disguised by momentary obscuring of the image, the audience is automatically compelled into complicity with the crime from its execution all the way to its necessary final ramifications. The men's tyrannical experiment transforms into something of a sickly alluring game and then, on satiric terms, emerges as a send-up of the model theatrical dinner party by undercutting the dialogue, generally prim and hackneyed as it is, with unwitting references to the corpse occupying the same room with the participants. Apart from everything else, this breed of black comedy is delicious. Later, though, the climactic ""moral apotheosis"" articulated by the Jimmy Stewart character serves to emphasize the iniquity underlying what we've found so fiendishly entertaining with the whole affair, and though this all may sound too preachy on first viewing, it actually delivers a rather intriguing point beyond face value, leading us to consider (through exaggerated means, no doubt) the inability of intellectualism to distinguish idealized hypothesis from a complex human reality.",4,Merely a technical exercise?,1027900800,"07 29, 2002",2002,1721,"['most', 'formally', 'daring', 'Hitchcock', 'thrillers', 'also', 'be', 'most', 'distressingly', 'perverse', 'heralding', 'master', 'burgeoning', 'fascination', 'logic', 'psychology', 'inexplicable', 'appeal', 'murder', 'case', 'dealing', 'unmotivated', 'murder', 'near-real-time', 'diabolical', 'exploits', 'two', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'slay', 'one', 'peers', 'then', 'stage', 'dinner', 'party', 'merely', 'examine', 'guests', 'suspicions', 'man', 'absence', 'sake', 'carrying', 'radical', 'academic', 'theorizing', 'full', 'practice', 'principal', 'photography', 'comprised', 'only', 'dozen', 'so', 'shots', 'cuts', 'disguised', 'momentary', 'obscuring', 'image', 'audience', 'automatically', 'compelled', 'complicity', 'crime', 'execution', 'way', 'necessary', 'final', 'ramifications', 'men', 'tyrannical', 'experiment', 'transforms', 'something', 'sickly', 'alluring', 'game', 'then', 'satiric', 'terms', 'send-up', 'model', 'theatrical', 'dinner', 'party', 'undercutting', 'dialogue', 'generally', 'prim', 'hackneyed', 'unwitting', 'references', 'corpse', 'occupying', 'same', 'room', 'participants', 'Apart', 'everything', 'else', 'breed', 'black', 'comedy', 'delicious', 'Later', 'though', 'climactic', 'moral', 'apotheosis', 'articulated', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'character', 'serves', 'emphasize', 'iniquity', 'underlying', 'what', ""'ve"", 'found', 'so', 'fiendishly', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'affair', 'may', 'sound', 'too', 'preachy', 'first', 'viewing', 'actually', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'point', 'face', 'value', 'leading', 'consider', 'exaggerated', 'means', 'doubt', 'inability', 'intellectualism', 'distinguish', 'idealized', 'hypothesis', 'complex', 'human', 'reality']",N/A

203893,A22ZVE83UJ6YGT,6300183580,Jack  Levic,"[1, 2]","It is clear Hitchcock was trying for a different angle in ROPE. There is just a brief establishing shot of the apartment building before we head directly into the action. Brandon and Phillip are in the process of strangling their friend David with a rope. They proceed to hide his body in a trunk in the living room. It certainly is an interesting way to start a film and it catches the viewer's attention but the film never fulfills its potentional. It becomes a psychological study of human nature without really coming to any conclusion.Brandon and Phillip have apparently killed David just for the fun and thrill of seeing if they could get away with it. The victim was not specifically chosen for any other reason that he was accessible. The intrigue and twist is that Brando and Phillip are having a dinner party that evening. David and his girlfriend, Janet,  and David's parents have been invited along with their prep school teacher Rupert Cadell. Another prep school friend, Kenneth, has been invited. Brandon seems to be invite discontent knowing Janet and Kenneth had once dated. David's mother can't make it so his father arrives with David's aunt.As a bizarre twist, Brandon decides to move the food from the dining room on to the trunk in the living room as the dead David lies inside? Sound odd? Well, it is and there seems to be some big pieces missing as the dinner party begins. Rupert immediately seems to suspect something is wrong and questions Brandon and Phillip constantly. Brandon is the obvious psychopath and Phillip is the emotionally weaker cohort who could spill the beans at any moment.The movie runs exactly as a play. In fact, the story, as is, would be better for stage than as a movie. The majority of the play occurs in the living room with a quick visit to the kitchen and dining rooms. The story seems to unfold in real time as the murder is committed and the maid arrives and then the quests.Here we have our story as everyone begins to wonder why the usually reliable David has not shown up for the dinner party. Little do they know that he is actually there. Brandon relishes the situation and enjoys his self-assuredness and Phillips is only seconds away from completely falling apart as Rupert fires questions and innuendos.One funny aside is that when dinner is served, Rupert immediately lights up a cigarette. That seemed so odd that I wondered if it had some importance. Also interesting is the exact relationship of Brandon and Phillip. How could Brandon convince a weaker Phillip to partake in the murder of a friend? They were heading off on a trip together after the dinner party?

203894,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6300183580,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Hitchcock is settling accounts with the united States in 1948, with the social Darwinism that has always been rampant, and in some period triumphant, in the USA. Fundamentally it is the idea that only good human beings, honest human beings succeed in society because they are chosen by God, hence they are superior in ethical values. In this film, there is no mention of God, right through to the final three minutes, but one young man decides to get rid of another young man for reasons we do not know, but as the result of a reasoning that states that superior people have the right to kill inferior people. It is in fact the good old ideology that excuses the master of a slave when he kills his slave because the slave is an inferior being. In 1948 the slave-masters are the rich and that young rich man believes he can kill another he considers inferior, except that he does it out of some challenge to provoke his own society. The killed young man is a member of that top society. And the killer and his associate, his accomplice throw a party just after killing the other and hiding him in a chest that is going to be used as the table for the buffet. Hitchcock finds it extremely funny to play on words and to create situations that become qui pro quos for us. But He also brings in an old teacher of these young men who had philosophically taught them that the superior people have the right to dominate, in a way or another, the inferior people in our society. Bringing this man in this party was the supreme achievement, and the supreme danger, for the killer because he is known as a dubitative and curious and scrutinizing and inquisitive mind that can read between lines and find out the truth even where it is not present. He is a conjuror of the truth. He is helped in doing that, in that mission of his by the maid who gives him the hat of the dead boy when he is on the point of going instead of his own. Then he will come back and confront the two killers and find out what they have done and manage to bring the police for the punishment of these two indecent beings. But that's when Hitchcock twists the whole story into the harshest accusation he could invent with this simple question: ""Do you think you were God, to decide who was superior and who was inferior?"" The twist is within a good protestant approach: if one really knows who is inferior, they would in that reasoning have the right- to kill the inferior ones. The Catholic approach of the problem that says that no one has the right to take a life because that life was given by God and God is the only one who can take it away or back is not even hinted at, which justifies then the conclusion from that teacher that society was going to make these killers pay for their crime in some kind of balanced declaration that implies one eye for one eye and one hand for one hand and one tooth for one tooth. Retaliation. With the distance of time that old film becomes a tremendous denunciation of killing other human beings, be it for some passion in the heart or mind of the murderer or be it for some retaliation from the society against that murderer: if one crime is unjustified, the retaliation to that crime is just as much unjustified. Both have to be equal for the second to be the retaliation of the first, hence both are murders. The Britisher was speaking there in Hitchcock, since Great Britain was going to be the first country in Europe to ban the death penalty in 1965. But that tradition of being ahead of others is an old habit in England who banned cruel punishments in its Bill of Rights in 1689.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Retaliation is murder,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,3731,"['Hitchcock', 'settling', 'accounts', 'united', 'States', '1948', 'social', 'Darwinism', 'always', 'been', 'rampant', 'period', 'triumphant', 'USA', 'Fundamentally', 'idea', 'only', 'good', 'human', 'beings', 'honest', 'human', 'beings', 'succeed', 'society', 'are', 'chosen', 'God', 'hence', 'are', 'superior', 'ethical', 'values', 'film', 'mention', 'God', 'right', 'final', 'three', 'minutes', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'get', 'rid', 'young', 'man', 'reasons', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'result', 'reasoning', 'superior', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'kill', 'inferior', 'people', 'fact', 'good', 'old', 'ideology', 'master', 'slave', 'when', 'slave', 'slave', 'inferior', 'being', '1948', 'slave-masters', 'are', 'rich', 'young', 'rich', 'man', 'can', 'kill', 'inferior', 'challenge', 'provoke', 'own', 'society', 'killed', 'young', 'man', 'member', 'top', 'society', 'killer', 'associate', 'accomplice', 'throw', 'party', 'just', 'killing', 'other', 'hiding', 'chest', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'table', 'buffet', 'Hitchcock', 'extremely', 'funny', 'play', 'words', 'create', 'situations', 'become', 'qui', 'pro', 'quos', 'also', 'old', 'teacher', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'philosophically', 'taught', 'superior', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'dominate', 'way', 'inferior', 'people', 'society', 'Bringing', 'man', 'party', 'was', 'supreme', 'achievement', 'supreme', 'danger', 'killer', 'known', 'dubitative', 'curious', 'scrutinizing', 'inquisitive', 'mind', 'can', 'read', 'lines', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'even', 'where', 'not', 'present', 'conjuror', 'truth', 'helped', 'doing', 'mission', 'maid', 'who', 'hat', 'dead', 'boy', 'when', 'point', 'going', 'instead', 'own', 'Then', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'confront', 'two', 'killers', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'manage', 'bring', 'police', 'punishment', 'two', 'indecent', 'beings', 'when', 'Hitchcock', 'whole', 'story', 'harshest', 'accusation', 'could', 'invent', 'simple', 'question', 'Do', 'think', 'were', 'God', 'decide', 'who', 'was', 'superior', 'who', 'was', 'inferior', 'twist', 'good', 'protestant', 'approach', 'one', 'really', 'who', 'inferior', 'would', 'reasoning', 'have', 'right-', 'kill', 'inferior', 'ones', 'Catholic', 'approach', 'problem', 'one', 'right', 'take', 'life', 'life', 'was', 'given', 'God', 'God', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'back', 'not', 'even', 'hinted', 'then', 'conclusion', 'teacher', 'society', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'killers', 'pay', 'crime', 'kind', 'balanced', 'declaration', 'one', 'eye', 'one', 'eye', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'tooth', 'one', 'tooth', 'Retaliation', 'distance', 'time', 'old', 'film', 'tremendous', 'denunciation', 'killing', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'be', 'passion', 'heart', 'mind', 'murderer', 'be', 'retaliation', 'society', 'murderer', 'one', 'crime', 'unjustified', 'retaliation', 'crime', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'unjustified', 'have', 'be', 'equal', 'second', 'be', 'retaliation', 'first', 'hence', 'are', 'murders', 'Britisher', 'was', 'speaking', 'there', 'Hitchcock', 'Great', 'Britain', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'first', 'country', 'Europe', 'ban', 'death', 'penalty', '1965', 'tradition', 'being', 'ahead', 'others', 'old', 'habit', 'England', 'who', 'banned', 'cruel', 'punishments', 'Bill', 'Rights', '1689.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Just wash your tv screen and your glasses and sit with your favorite bowl of popcorn and enjoy.The movie flows like one continuous shot as you follow the actors from furniture to furniture, room to room. If you have a real keen eye, you will notice each scene was filmed continuously for 4 to 10 minutes without stopping the motion picture camera. If an actor made a mistake, they had to start all over again. There are 10 continuous scenes put together in this movie. Can you tell where the connection was made?The idea for this movie is based upon the real Leopold-Leob murder case of 1924, later dramatized in the movie,Compulsion(1959) andSwoon(1992).Alfred Hitchcock did the continuous scene filming again inUnder Capricorn [DVD] (1949), but not as much, and again to a limited extent inAlfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright(1950).Note: As the characters were in this movie, actors John Dall and Farley Granger were gay as well.

203898,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,6300183580,Jason N. Mical,"[1, 1]","Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, the first film that the Master of Suspense filmed in Technicolor, has languished in largely undeserved mediocrty since its release in 1948.  The film didn't do well theatrically in the US, and subsequent versions (VHS) were made from terrible-quality originals.  Finally, Universal has seen fit to release on DVD a marvelously restored version of a truly fine film.Rope, based on a play of the same name, which was in turn based on a real murder case in 1924, opens with two friends - played by John Dall and Farley Granger - strangling a classmate with a length of rope.  The body is then stuffed in a trunk that the two use as a buffet table during an upcoming dinner party - a party partially in their murdered friend's honor.As the movie progresses, the friends' professor - played exceedingly well by James Stewart in one of his best-acted roles - eventually begins to suspect the crime.  As the two students engage him in a discussion about Nietzschian philosophy, and specifically philosophy of the ubermensch (overman or superman), Stewart's character puts two and two together.  The tension is so tight you hold your breath for the last half-hour, wondering if Stewart knows, and if he does, what he's going to do about it - and, more importantly, if he's in danger, too.Much has been made of the technical side of the film - Hitch wanted it as close to a stage play as possible, and the entire movie has only nine (well-hidden) breaks - as well as the homosexual overtones, but the real genius in Rope comes from the acting and direction.  As opposed to today's &quot;roller-coaster ride&quot; action movies, Rope builds slowly, layering tension upon tension until the viewer just can't wait anymore to find out what happens.  Anyone can toy with an audience, using special effects, explosions, and fast cars to create action, but true suspense - that hourglass feeling of grains of sand building a mountain - takes talent, and Rope readily uses that effect, thanks largely to the preformances of the three main characters.In addition, Stewart's ultimate conclusions on Nietzschian philosophy offer a refreshing step away from those who would indict it solely on the basis of notions (and books) like the Will to Power - people who can see no further than the two murderers.  Like Hitler and Dall and Granger's characters, some people cannot see past these passages, often taken out of context from the rest of Nietzsche's thought.  Thankfully, Arthur Laurentis' screenplay ultimately deals with these ideas in a mature manner - and shows the horrifying effects of the hubris so many undergraduate-level students get when they don't bother to read and conside Nietzsche in context.Universal's DVD is excellent - the picture and sound quality are top-notch, especially considering its been more than 50 years since Rope was filmed.  The full-frame presentation isn't a problem, since widescreen movies didn't exist at the time.  The half-hour long featurette offers some interesting insights and interviews with a couple members of the cast and crew, and isn't your usual &quot;so-and-so was great&quot; pieces.  Hume Cronyn offers some genuine - and well-founded - criticisms of both Hitch and the finished product.  Also included is Rope's unique theatrical trailer, a kind of &quot;mini-short&quot; featuring the soon-to-be-murdered lad discussing a marriage proposal with his girlfriend in Central Park, in surprisingly decent quality considering the film's age.If you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, or just like great acting and pianowire-tight tension, then you can't go wrong with Rope.",5,An Overlooked Classic Finally Given Its Due,990662400,"05 24, 2001",2001,3627,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rope', 'first', 'film', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'filmed', 'Technicolor', 'languished', 'largely', 'undeserved', 'mediocrty', 'release', '1948', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theatrically', 'US', 'subsequent', 'versions', 'VHS', 'were', 'made', 'terrible-quality', 'originals', 'Finally', 'Universal', 'seen', 'fit', 'release', 'DVD', 'marvelously', 'restored', 'version', 'truly', 'fine', 'film.Rope', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'turn', 'based', 'real', 'murder', 'case', '1924', 'two', 'friends', 'played', 'John', 'Dall', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'strangling', 'classmate', 'length', 'rope', 'body', 'then', 'stuffed', 'trunk', 'two', 'use', 'buffet', 'table', 'upcoming', 'dinner', 'party', 'party', 'partially', 'murdered', 'friend', 'movie', 'friends', 'professor', 'played', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'James', 'Stewart', 'one', 'best-acted', 'roles', 'eventually', 'suspect', 'crime', 'two', 'students', 'engage', 'discussion', 'Nietzschian', 'philosophy', 'specifically', 'philosophy', 'ubermensch', 'overman', 'superman', 'Stewart', 'character', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'tension', 'so', 'tight', 'hold', 'breath', 'last', 'half-hour', 'wondering', 'Stewart', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'more', 'importantly', 'danger', 'too.Much', 'been', 'made', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'Hitch', 'wanted', 'close', 'stage', 'play', 'possible', 'entire', 'movie', 'only', 'nine', 'well-hidden', 'breaks', 'as', 'well', 'homosexual', 'overtones', 'real', 'genius', 'Rope', 'acting', 'direction', 'opposed', 'today', 'quot', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'quot', 'action', 'movies', 'Rope', 'slowly', 'layering', 'tension', 'tension', 'viewer', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'anymore', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Anyone', 'can', 'toy', 'audience', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'explosions', 'fast', 'cars', 'create', 'action', 'true', 'suspense', 'hourglass', 'feeling', 'grains', 'sand', 'building', 'mountain', 'talent', 'Rope', 'readily', 'effect', 'thanks', 'largely', 'preformances', 'three', 'main', 'characters.In', 'addition', 'Stewart', 'ultimate', 'conclusions', 'Nietzschian', 'philosophy', 'offer', 'refreshing', 'step', 'away', 'who', 'would', 'indict', 'solely', 'basis', 'notions', 'books', 'Will', 'Power', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'further', 'two', 'murderers', 'Hitler', 'Dall', 'Granger', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'passages', 'often', 'taken', 'out', 'context', 'rest', 'Nietzsche', 'thought', 'Thankfully', 'Arthur', 'Laurentis', 'screenplay', 'ultimately', 'ideas', 'mature', 'manner', 'horrifying', 'effects', 'hubris', 'so', 'many', 'undergraduate-level', 'students', 'get', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'read', 'conside', 'Nietzsche', 'context.Universal', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'considering', 'been', 'more', '50', 'years', 'Rope', 'was', 'filmed', 'full-frame', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'problem', 'widescreen', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'time', 'half-hour', 'long', 'featurette', 'interesting', 'insights', 'interviews', 'couple', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', ""n't"", 'usual', 'quot', 'so-and-so', 'was', 'great', 'quot', 'pieces', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'genuine', 'well-founded', 'criticisms', 'Hitch', 'finished', 'product', 'Also', 'included', 'Rope', 'unique', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'kind', 'quot', 'mini-short', 'quot', 'featuring', 'soon-to-be-murdered', 'lad', 'discussing', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'girlfriend', 'Central', 'Park', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'quality', 'considering', 'film', 'age.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'just', 'great', 'acting', 'pianowire-tight', 'tension', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Rope']",N/A

Green,"[0, 0]","Two friends, Brandon and Phillip (John Dall and Farley Granger), kill a classmate - mainly for the thrill - but also because they believe themselves intelligent and superior enough to get away with it.  They then have a dinner with several of the victims friends and family, all while the body lies inside a large wooden chest from which the food is served.  But Phillip is bothered by the murder, and acts nervously and drinks constantly.  Brandon, on the other hand, is thrilled at having done it, and can't help but make suggestive comments in front of the group.  One of the guests, Rupert (James Stewart), is a former teacher of the young men, and begins to notice the odd behavior of the pair and suspects something is wrong.Had I seen this film a few years ago I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed it very much.  On the surface it's not a very exciting film, but it's actually a very well-told story.  The idea came from the very sensational and disturbing crime of the teenage ""thrill killers"" Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in 1924, but the thought of justifiable murder of ""inferior persons"" was perhaps a reflection of Nietzsche or the recent Nazi holocaust (the film was made in 1948).But the strange behavior of the pair serves to heighten the tension and build suspense throughout the film.  The rope used in the murder turns up in a rather shocking way, and a scene where the housekeeper cleans up, almost uncovering the body, is quite dramatic.  You almost find yourself hoping they won't get caught.

If you like live theater, clever writing, great acting, and classy 1940s ambiance, there's no more satisfying movie than this one. Even after you've seen it thirty or so times like I have and the suspense factor is irrelevant, you can still marvel at the brilliant manner in which the whole thing was executed. This DVD edition is everything you could possibly want. Let me say it once and for all: With very few exceptions, there were no widescreen movies before 1953!!! I'm so tired of reading where people complain about the lack of widescreen in the DVD versions of classic movies. The only way to present ""Rope"" (or ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Casablanca"" etc.) in a letterbox shape would be to cut off the top and/or bottom of the picture, and who wants that?! But I digress. . . . The picture quality of this DVD is remarkable--e.g., I noticed the pattern in Joan Chandler's dress for the first time. The glorious Technicolor here is worthy of the name, and although the monophonic soundtrack is nothing to get excited about (multichannel soundtracks came with the widescreen era) at least it's crisp. clear, and free of distortion. The extra features are awesome, particularly the theatrical trailer which in effect provides an additional scene to the story! And if you're an old-movie purist like me, you'll be happy to see the original Warner Bros. logos restored at the beginning and the end instead of the tacked-on 1980s-era Universal logos seen in previous video versions.

In each of the plays, suspense is the chief element.  In ""Rope"" we watch a dinner party held in a New York apartment.  Two university students, prompted by self-justifying bravado, murder a third.  They hide his body in a large chest upon which they then set the food for the guests, all family and friends of the murdered student, to partake.How to create an 80 minute film set entirely in one New York apartment was challenging.  Hitchcock decided to film it in color (his first color film), to present the action in an apparently seamless series of 10 minute ""takes"", and to start the film with the murder (it had not been included in the play).Seeing his film in this excellent DVD restoration, it is some of these filming decisions that I have found most interesting.  The dialogue may be unnatural, and the cast members uneasy, but the man in charge of filming certainly knew how to build suspense.  Especially effective is the ending, when the illuminated advertising signs and the noises from the streets below begin to infiltrate through the windows.Included in the extras are comments from scriptwriters, a cast member, and Hitchcock's daughter.",4,Hitchcock Experimenting,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,1391,"['Following', 'success', 'film', 'Gaslight', 'based', 'play', 'written', 'Englishman', 'Patrick', 'Hamilton', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'making', 'film', 'scheduled', 'film', 'adaptation', '1929', 'play', 'same', 'author', 'Rope', 'plays', 'suspense', 'chief', 'element', 'Rope', 'watch', 'dinner', 'party', 'held', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'Two', 'university', 'students', 'prompted', 'self-justifying', 'bravado', 'murder', 'third', 'hide', 'body', 'large', 'chest', 'then', 'set', 'food', 'guests', 'family', 'friends', 'murdered', 'student', 'partake.How', 'create', '80', 'minute', 'film', 'set', 'entirely', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'was', 'challenging', 'Hitchcock', 'decided', 'film', 'color', 'first', 'color', 'film', 'present', 'action', 'apparently', 'seamless', 'series', '10', 'minute', 'start', 'film', 'murder', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'included', 'play', '.Seeing', 'film', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'restoration', 'filming', 'decisions', 'have', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'may', 'be', 'unnatural', 'cast', 'members', 'uneasy', 'man', 'charge', 'filming', 'certainly', 'knew', 'how', 'build', 'suspense', 'Especially', 'effective', 'ending', 'when', 'illuminated', 'advertising', 'signs', 'noises', 'streets', 'begin', 'infiltrate', 'windows.Included', 'extras', 'are', 'comments', 'scriptwriters', 'cast', 'member', 'Hitchcock', 'daughter']",N/A

But Hitchcock decided to preserve the classical dramatic unities, not open it up but confine it to the stage set and, if that were not enough, use a single camera which would wheel around the set for the full duration of the film magazine - ten minutes.Some critics have described the result as excruciating.  Actually, it's not all that bad, but this is far from being his greatest film.

This movie was shot all in one location, an apartment, and in very long takes made to look like all one take.  It kind of plays out like a stage play.  This method of filming was largely an experiment by Hitchcock.  The movie is about two roommates who kill an ""undesirable"" former classmate of theirs and hide the body in their apartment.  They then host a dinner party as a way to see if the murder can go undetected so they can feel like they committed the ""perfect murder"".  The reason for the murder was so these two guys could have a feeling of superiority over another person and basically get a rush or a power trip out of it, if you will.  The picture and sound quality both are excellent for this 63 year old movie.  The music is pretty good as well.The plot is sick and twisted, but I find this an interesting movie.

They hide his body in a trunk in their apartment, on the same night that they are giving a dinner party--one that includes the victim's parents. If this weren't macabre enough, they decide to move the dinner from the dining table to the trunk, so that everyone is feasting off David's grave.Amongst the guests are David's current girlfriend, Janet, and her former boyfriend, Kenneth, David's father and his sister-in-law, and Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), former housemaster of the three youths.Rope is Hitchcock's take on Leopold and Loeb, the 1924 murder in which two wealthy, privileged young men kill a boy in order to commit the perfect crime. He didn't reproduce the crime but rather the flavor of the crime, including their fascination with the theories of Fredrick Nietzsche.In the film, Rupert unwittingly expounds on that theory, of the idea that the privileged few are allowed to get murder, which Brandon eagerly takes up and agrees with. When asked who should be the special few, Brandon replies himself, and Philip and maybe Rupert.The film is told in typical Hitchcock suspenseful fashion, the audience often becoming privy to things that the characters don't know. Such as when the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, begins to clear the meal from the trunk, including the two candelabra, while the others are engaged in conversation. The camera follows Mrs. Wilson in her seemingly mundane task,  made morbid only by the knowledge of what is in the trunk. The audience is held in suspense, wondering if she will open the trunk and see what is there.The story flows from beginning to end without a moment of lag or boredom. Of the two young murderers, Brandon is the brash one with the devil may care attitude, while Philip has more of a conscience over what they've done. Philip is more fearful of being caught, while you get the impression, Brandon could talk his way out of anything, and probably has on more than one occasion.I had heard of Rope a long time ago, but didn't know anything about it, and made no effort to watch it until I discovered that it was indeed based on Leopold and Loeb, and then it become a must-see for me. I've watched it twice already, and love it. Everything takes place in their apartment, as if it were a play. Not surprising, considering that Rope started as a play first.What I find particularly fascinating is the pink elephant in the room that everyone is aware of and no one talks about. Namely, homosexuality. The clues are there. Philip and Brandon are obviously a couple and everyone treats them that way. They have one bedroom. They vacation together, as if it were only natural. Their interactions are of the intimate variety. Philip talks of being scared of Brandon, even when they were in prep school, and then admits it's part of Brandon's charm.But not once in the film will you hear the subject mentioned in any way. Hitchcock pushed the envelope without appearing to do so. He was fascinated with the protagonists not because they were homosexuals, but because they were murdering homosexuals.There is an extra on the DVD called Rope Unleashed that is well worth watching.I can only think of two flaws off the top of my head. One is a continuity error, the other an error in casting.There's a scene where a tense Philip clutches his champagne glass too tightly and shatters it cutting his hand, bleeding well enough to need to bind it with his handkerchief. Yet, only a few minutes later, when David's aunt takes his hand in order to read his future, both hands are unblemished.James Stewart is, in my opinion, miscast as Rupert Cadell, the former housemaster. I didn't realize, until I watched Rope Unleashed, that the character had an affair with one of the young men (my guess is Brandon), but you never get a feel for that. I love Jimmy Stewart, but I didn't feel the connection there. He didn't make me feel his guilt for teaching them Nietzsche to begin with.  Also, his role didn't warrant his receiving top billing. Farley Granger and John Dall should have had that.

The beauty and suspense of Hitchcock films is evident in this one, with only a handful of actors, set in primarily one room.  Clearly, every one of these actors pulls his/her own weight in a story of murder and suspense as we wonder if the murderers will be found out.  Hitchcock was intrigued by the play, based on a real murder from 1924.The story begins with the &#34;artistic&#34; murder of a young man named David, just because . . . The idea is for the two men to kill someone, just because they can, and show they can get away with it.  Farley Granger (Hitchcock's Stranger on a Train) is the worry-wart of the two men, loaded with fear and guilt.  The other man is so cocky and arrogant you want to slap his face, yet his arrogance is amazing to watch.  He believes himself superior, and the things he does as he proceedes to have a dinner party with David's fiancee, relatives, and friends, is amazing; meanwhile, David is sleeping securely in a large chest in the same room.The double-meaning verbiage is specifically chosen throughout the play.  The morbid humor and relationships intertwine as we watch Jimmy Stewart (a former teacher) slither through the small crowd, picking up clues with his natural investigative curiousity.  It makes you want to scream &#34;There!

They hide the body in their living room and then host a cocktail party as if nothing happened. But one guest, their old prep school house master (James Stewart), is suspicious right from the start.Hitchcock wanted to experiment in filming longer takes, up to ten minutes long, rather than the typical take of just a few seconds. It makes the movie look like a staged play, with the story taking place in just one room, no action, and a lot of talking. James Stewart goes against his usual nice-guy persona to play a cynical and sarcastic man who thinks he knows more than everyone else. He's not likable and that detracts from the story. Dall is charismatic and frightening as the more confident of the killers but Granger's weakling character is too highly-strung, too obviously guilty right from the start. Some subtlety was called for and is missing. All of the supporting actors overact throughout with the exception of Cedric Hardwicke, who is wonderful as a concerned party guest.The dialogue is too perfect and stagy with everyone taking turns speaking politely and with perfectly measured wit; no one interrupts or pauses. It's not at all realistic. There's never any doubt that the killers will be discovered which eliminates any possible tension or excitement; there is no hero to root for and the villains are too loony to care about.

203917,A1MUN0M965UR4O,6300183580,Kooshmeister,"[1, 1]","This is probably the oldest film I've ever recommended, an Alfred Hitchcock film from 1948 starring Jimmy Stewart. But despite its age it's definitely one of Mr. Hitchcock's most suspenseful films, right up there with Rear Window and Vertigo.Behind the drawn shades of an upscale late 1940's apartment, while the rest of the city carries on about its business in blissful ignorance, college students Brandon Shaw and his best friend Phillip Morgan have just done the unthinkable. They've just gotten finished murdering their classmate and supposed friend David Kentley by strangling him with a length of rope. After finishing up and stuffing the corpse into a convenient antique trunk in the living room, they open the shades and begin preparing to host a dinner party, which, in a way, the dearly departed David will be the star of. To attend will be David's father Henry Kentley, his girlfriend Janet Walker, best friend Kenneth Lawrence, and the three boys' own professor, Rupert Cadell.Brandon and Phillip, you see, are homicidal maniacs. Or at least Brandon is. They've committed the murder and are arranging the party as what they consider an intellectual exercise. The two are believers in the concept of the &#34;supermen&#34; as proposed by Friedrich Nietzsche and taught to them in school by Rupert in his philosophy class. They view themselves as superior to other people, and want to prove it by committing the &#34;perfect murder&#34; and getting away with it. Brandon sees the party at which all of David's friends and family will be attending as the &#34;finishing touch&#34; on the crime, seeing it as a means of flaunting his cleverness right under everyone else's noses, complete with serving a buffet off of the top of the trunk holding David's body, despite Phillip's misgivings and increasing unease.Phillip is concerned Rupert (who the duo view as being a fellow &#34;superman&#34;) will catch on to what has happened. Brandon is counting on it. Since Rupert is the one who taught them all about Nietzsche's philosophy, he is eager to impress the professor, partly, it seems, because, to him, Rupert's approval will justify the murder. He never says this outright, though.The guests begin arriving and of course everyone notices David's absence. Especially Rupert. As the evening wears on and the party grows more and more tense, thanks particularly to Phillip drinking a lot more than he ought to in an effort to steady his nerves, and Brandon becoming increasingly more and overt in the little hints he keeps &#34;cleverly&#34; dropping, it begins to look like things are building towards an explosive climax. But what will happen? Will the two killers get away with their crime, or will someone find them out...?Rope was a film that suitably impressed me the first time I saw it (on YouTube of all places!). Very gripping from beginning to end and it must've been quite daring at the time to have the killers be the protagonists, and have them be strangely likable (if utterly unsympathetic of course). The structure is also unique to me. We know who the murderers are, as well as the how and the why, and even where the body is hidden. We, like Brandon and Phillip, are one step ahead of all of the other characters. The question consequently becomes not &#34;who killed David&#34; but &#34;how will they get caught?&#34;The arrival of Jimmy Stewart as Rupert amps up the tension, since he is just as smart and clever as our murderous duo and it becomes a subtle and weirdly polite battle of wits between him and Brandon as we watch Rupert start to slowly unravel what we already know. I think this just might be my ultimate favorite Hitchcock film besides North by Northwest and Vertigo.Much has been said of the fact Rope is done in only a few shots. I wanna discuss how Stewart enters the picture. Most of the other guests are shown arriving via the front door, but not Rupert; the camera pans over during a wide shot of the living room and he's just suddenly there, as if he materialized out of thin air. It's subtly jarring in a way and helps set him apart from the other party guests as Brandon and Phillip's nemesis and also helps underscore how his relationship to them unfolds - he is expected but unexpected; they know he's coming but he just shows up out of the blue in a slyly startling way, and although Brandon is expecting (or hoping) Rupert will solve the mystery, Rupert's reaction to the revelation is the last thing Brandon expected.People have said Jimmy Stewart was miscast as college professor Rupert. I totally disagree. He has a laid back, lazy, subtle and sly aura of what I can only call &#34;benevolent menace&#34; to him (if that makes any sense) and it helps keep the audience (as well as Brandon and Phillip!) guessing as to how much Rupert knows. His end speech is one of the most utterly powerful and emotional performances in his career I think. John Dall as Brandon deserves special mention as well.",5,One of Hitchcock's finest!,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,4959,"['probably', 'oldest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'recommended', 'Alfred',

The bright colors contrast with a dark and perverse plot of two young men , Brandon (John Dall), and Phillip (Farley Granger).  They have made a pact to strangle an ""inferior"" classmate, and emote their arrogance, saying of murder:  ""A crime for most, a privilege for some. ""  They are confident that nothing can go wrong. Brandon and Phillip are sure no one will guess what happened to David, all details are planned, including having a party with the dead body hidden at the scene.The first scene shows the strangling and them hiding David's  body in a old wooden chest.  A somewhat lengthy conversation ensues explaining the reasoning behind such a cold-blooded murder.  The chest is placed obviously in the middle of the room.  This is not enough for Brandon  - he moves all the food and drink from the dining area so guests must face the chest and the murderes can delight in knowing there is a hidden body.  This is just a game to show the ""perfection"" of their crime.  They purposely invite one of their college professors, who has opinions on the perfect murder,  Rupert Cadell (Jimmy Stewart).  However, this turns out to be a mistake. Like a bloodhound, he immediately starts sniffing around and noticing small clues that indicate this is more than just a little cocktail party.Cadell keeps Brandon and Phillip on their toes with his observations and deductions.

203923,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,6300183580,"Maine Writer ""David""","[3, 6]","Rope presents the story of two charmed -- but hardly charming -- prep school ""chums"" who, in addition to being, for all appearances, lovers, decide to kill someone just because they can. You see, these two perfectly preened dandies fancy themselves the elite and above the law and other nuisances meant for the dullards and nincompoops that comprise the vast majority of humanity. It turns out they've read a little too much Nietzsche at the feet of their prep school idol, Rupert. Yes, Rupert. What's clever and somewhat interesting about the story is how they decide to host a party in the very room where the body is hidden. Not that it's funny or  meant for laughs. To the contrary, Rope is meant to be rather serious stuff about a couple of sociopaths.Rope has the feel of a stage play (it was based on a play), with all but the opening scenes played out on a single set -- an apartment with ever-changing, but fake-looking view of New York. The view gives the scene a surrealistic feel that, overall, is a plus.For all of that, Rope suffers from the kind of stilted, mannered acting most often encountered in the theater. People don't speak to each so much as deliver lines that often border on speeches. It's melodramatic and cloying, at least to my sensibilities. This is the opposite of the naturalistic acting to which we've become accustomed. There's also something fake and manipulative about the story and its unfolding, even though it was, ostensibly, inspired by the real life case of Leopold and Loeb (to which it bears only a passing resemblance). It's also preachy in its own way, with Jimmy Stewart, as Rupert, transforming before our eyes from an existentialist to a conscience-stricken moralist. While he's given good cause to reevaluate his philosophical views, his performance simply isn't convincing. (It is quaint to note that, back in the day, firing a gun from a New York City apartment window could get the attention of the police.)This is a weak entry from Hitchcock.

Will they get away with murder?  If not, which will give them away first, Brandon's arrogance or Phillip's guilty conscience?This is a very intriguing psychological thriller.  Based on a play, the movie was filmed on one rather limited set and was filmed in as few takes as possible.  While those transitions (to reload film) are obvious, the constant rolling of the camera adds to the suspense.  There are some strange camera angles at times, but they build the suspense as well.  The limited set is an added bonus as it focuses our attention to build the suspense.The acting is absolutely wonderful.  While it does suffer at times from the overacting prevalent at the time (at least by today's standards), it captures the characters and their emotions perfectly.  This is especially true of John Dall and Fraley Granger who bring such nuance to their characters we always know their thoughts.

203928,A1PO9XWS0DWP7Z,6300183580,Mark Hite,"[2, 2]","The merits of Hitchcock's experimental film ROPE have been endlessly debated. (See below!)What I find fascinating about this film is what it reveals about the skill of the actors, especially Jimmy Stewart.  In an ordinary film, a performance is as much the creation of the director and editor as it is the actor.  The choice of takes and angles, the pace of the cutting, etc. all work to enhance or subdue an actor's work.  In ROPE, with its continuous 10 minute shots, the actors' work is plainly revealed. As in a live play, they are on their own to maintain the pace and the intensity of the drama.Hitchcock's cast doesn't ever let the energy flag.  Farley Grainger and John Dall tear right into the opening, visibly sweating their way through the early murder scene.  The drama shifts tone with the introduction of each new actor, but it is not until Jimmy Stewart enters that the movie snaps into place.  Where the others are intense and theatrical, Stewart is comfortable and deceptively easy-going.  Watch how skillfully he alters the tension and shifts the mood with his control of movement and voice.  Even when he is on the edge of the scene his reactions give the drama focus.  This is one of Stewart's most underrated performances.  He enters this stagy drama, takes a deep breath, and makes it fascinating and fun to watch.This is still Hitchcock, of course. Note the pacing of the camera, the elegant set and moody lighting, and the cleverly suspenseful use of music.  But ROPE I think is most interesting for this unique opportunity to study Jimmy Stewart's skill as an actor.Watch it again and see what you think!",4,A unique showcase for Jimmy Stewart,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1629,"['merits', 'Hitchcock', 'experimental', 'film', 'ROPE', 'have', 'been', 'endlessly', 'debated', 'See', 'What', 'find', 'fascinating', 'film', 'what', 'skill', 'actors', 'especially', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'ordinary', 'film', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'creation', 'director', 'editor', 'actor', 'choice', 'angles', 'pace', 'cutting', 'etc', 'work', 'enhance', 'subdue', 'actor', 'work', 'ROPE', 'continuous', '10', 'minute', 'shots', 'actors', 'work', 'plainly', 'revealed', 'live', 'play', 'are', 'own', 'maintain', 'pace', 'intensity', 'drama.Hitchcock', 'cast', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'energy', 'flag', 'Farley', 'Grainger', 'John', 'Dall', 'tear', 'right', 'opening', 'visibly', 'sweating', 'way', 'early', 'murder', 'scene', 'drama', 'tone', 'introduction', 'new', 'actor', 'not', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'place', 'Where', 'others', 'are', 'intense', 'theatrical', 'Stewart', 'comfortable', 'deceptively', 'easy-going', 'Watch', 'how', 'skillfully', 'tension', 'shifts', 'mood', 'control', 'movement', 'voice', 'Even', 'when', 'edge', 'scene', 'reactions', 'give', 'drama', 'focus', 'one', 'Stewart', 'most', 'underrated', 'performances', 'stagy', 'drama', 'deep', 'breath', 'fascinating', 'fun', 'watch.This', 'still', 'Hitchcock', 'course', 'Note', 'pacing', 'camera', 'elegant', 'set', 'moody', 'lighting', 'cleverly', 'suspenseful', 'use', 'music', 'ROPE', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'study', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'skill', 'actor.Watch', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'think']",N/A
203929,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,6300183580,Mat,"[2, 2]","This 1948 Hitchcock film is mostly noted for its technical achievements. Hitchcock filmed this story, about two well-to-do rich kids who decide to commit a murder for the fun of it, as a play. Which, it in fact, originally was, though based in London and not New York. Technical limitations did not enable his original vision of making the entire picture one continuous long shot. Instead it is made up of several 8 minute continious shots. This was the length of film that fit into one reel. Using some very inventive cutting techniques the film appears as if it was filmed all in one take. This is more impressive when you see the actual size that color film cameras were during this time period. They were absolutely enormous, bigger than a man standing. To move the camera in and around the small stage space, many of the set pieces were set on castors and rolled about to keep out of the way of the camera. Some of the actors were noted in saying that they worried everytime they sat down, that there might not be a chair for them to fall into. Another achievement of the film is in terms of lighting. The apartment that the entire film is set in has several large windows overlooking the city. As the movie is more or less uninterupted from start to finnish we see the lighting change as the sun begins to set and night falls. It is a testament to this achievment that upon first viewing you don't really notice the effect. Yet, the filmakers took great pains to get it to look realistic, staging numerous reshoots for the final few scenes.Though the technical achievements are quite wonderful, it is a shame that they have overshadowed what it really a very good bit of suspense. It seems the two high society murderers have planned a dinner party just after the murder. They store the corpse in a wood box that is featured prominently in the midst of the dinner. This creates an excellent mix of suspense and the macabre. Throughout the party the murderers become more unraveled even as they are enjoying their little game.All of the acting is quite good. The two murderer (John Dall and Farley Granger) do a fine job of playing intelectual, society playboys, with a desire for excitement. It is slighly annoying watching their excited, nervous mannerisms (especially some stuttering by Jon Dall) but it is fitting with the characters. Their former instructor, Rupert Cadell, is played magnificently by the impecible James Stewart. This is a bit of departure from Stewarts typical roles. Here he is a tough, cynical intellectual. This was his first of four collaborations between Stewart and Hitchock and it is hard to imagine his role as Scottie in Vertigo without having first played in this movie.The story unravels in typical Hitchock fashion. The suspense is built, then lessoned by some well timed comedy, and then built again to a final crescendo. Hitchcock was excellent as a technical director and allowed his actors the breathing room they needed for fine performances. In the end I left the picture feeling more excited about the superb storytelling than any particular technical achievement. It is a testament to his craft, that Hitchock allows you to leave a picture being enamored with his story over his technical achievements. Some of the greatest effects are those you don't notice because they seem so natural and real.The documentary that accompanies the DVD version had some discussion of the homosexual nature of the two murderers as well and James Stewart's character. The production codes of the time would only allow the slightest hints of homosexuality in a motion picture. In fact I had no idea any character might be homosexual while watching the movie, and it was until I watched the documentary that I thought anything about it at all. Upon review I can see where the two murderers mannerisms may have pointed in that direction. Although James Stewarts presence is so wholesome and devoid of sex that any notion of the characters sexuality is more a point of trivia at this point.Alfred Hitchock manages a triumph of technical brilliance and suspense in Rope.

203930,AXQ8T2D9IT6UG,6300183580,"M. B. Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[2, 3]","""Rope"", a film based on a play and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a well-made thriller that entertains the spectator, but that is far from being perfect.I must say that the story is original, and that the beginning is quite shocking. The two main characters are Brandon and Philip  (John Dall and Farley Granger), two young men that commit a crime just to see if they can get away with murder. As if killing another man weren't enough, they decide to tempt fate, hiding the body in a trunk, where it could easily be discovered, and inviting some people to dinner. Their guests include, among others, the victim's parents, his girlfriend and an old schoolteacher that gets increasingly suspicious regarding Brandon and Philip's actions. The schoolteacher (James Stewart) doesn't know exactly what they did, but is certain that something is wrong, very wrong. And of course, he cannot understand why Philip keeps looking at the trunk that is used as a buffet table...On the whole, I can say that I liked ""Rope"", even though I wouldn't be overly eager to watch it again. From my point of view, you will also enjoy this whodunnit, specially if you are fond of Hitchcock movies, and don't mind the fact that albeit good, this is not one of his best films.Belen AlcatPS: I give ""Rope"" 3.5 stars...",4,"""That's the difference between us and other men: they talk about committing the perfect crime, we do it""",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,1293,"['Rope', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'well-made', 'thriller', 'spectator', 'far', 'being', 'perfect.I', 'must', 'say', 'story', 'original', 'beginning', 'quite', 'shocking', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Brandon', 'Philip', 'John', 'Dall', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'commit', 'crime', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'killing', 'man', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'decide', 'tempt', 'fate', 'hiding', 'body', 'trunk', 'where', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'discovered', 'inviting', 'people', 'dinner', 'guests', 'include', 'others', 'victim', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'old', 'schoolteacher', 'increasingly', 'suspicious', 'regarding', 'Brandon', 'Philip', 'actions', 'schoolteacher', 'James', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'certain', 'something', 'wrong', 'very', 'wrong', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Philip', 'looking', 'trunk', 'used', 'buffet', 'table', 'whole', 'can', 'say', 'liked', 'Rope', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'overly', 'eager', 'watch', 'again', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'whodunnit', 'specially', 'are', 'fond', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'albeit', 'good', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'films.Belen', 'AlcatPS', 'give', 'Rope', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

203933,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,6300183580,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[4, 5]","Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, the first of what would eventually become four collaborative efforts with actor and close friend James Stewart, was based not only on a popular British play, Rope's End (the re-titling given to the play when it came to Broadway after the release of the 1948 Hitchcock picture) by Patrick Hamilton, but an actual event as well. Hitchcock much like Hume Cronyn and Henry Traver's characters in Shadow of a Doubt was quite the aficionado when it came to famous murder cases, using many he followed as a child in England as inspiration for some of his early works. It is no surprise then to see why Rope peeked his interest. Hamilton's play was based on the murder trial of Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. and Richard A. Loeb, more commonly referred to as simply Leopold and Loeb, two wealthy and homosexual University of Chicago students who inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of advanced `supermen' sought to commit the perfect murder. Their victim, fourteen-year old Bobby Franks, was bludgeoned with a chisel, suffocated to death, burned with acid so as to make identification all the more difficult, and dumped in a sewage pipe. Avoiding a jury trial, the two `men' were given ninety-nine years to life, though neither one served their full sentence (Loeb was killed in prison at age thirty-five and Leopold was paroled in 1958 and moved to Puerto Rico).James Stewart was drafted into the United States Army Air Corps one year prior to the United States' official entry into World War II, serving admirably in combat and rising to the rank of colonel. However, upon his return from war in the mid-1940s, he became increasingly disillusioned with Hollywood and was on the verge of quitting the movie business altogether. Stewart took up Hitchcock's offer to play Rupert Cadell in his feature film adaptation of Rope if he was allowed to wave his salary for a percentage of the film's box office gross. It was accepted.Rope is a very short film, even by today's standards, clocking in at one hour and twenty-five minutes. Therefore everything rides on the performances of the three main leads and Stewart for one does so with gusto. In the Patrick Hamilton play, Rupert in addition to being the boys' former schoolmaster was also their one-time gay lover. It however makes more sense for Rupert to be played off as Brandon and Phillip's surrogate father then their lover because as a surrogate father he must bear witness to the sadistic manipulation of his ideas and face the difficult task of admit to his own `sons' that he was wrong in what he said. It is even more painful therefore for him to have to turn his `children' into the authorities for something he taught them but never believed they would ever seriously consider. The final scene in which Stewart wrestles with himself over the gun is sheer brilliance. Does he shoot the gun out the window and alert the police, take justice into his own hands and kill the murderers himself, or in a fit of disparity turn the gun on himself? Chilling and intriguing to the bitter end, Stewart's convincing performance truly makes this film the classic that it is.John Dall is downright nefarious as Brandon Shaw, the `mastermind' if you will behind this experimentation in Nietzsche's `superman' theory and how such men are above the moral limitations of their inferiors. It is to say the least a bit unnerving to see a sense of accomplishment, even distinct pleasure, come across his face after strangling young David to death and then proceeding to host a social get-together with the father and girlfriend of the victim in the same room as the trunk containing the victim's corpse. Dall uses witty yet dry, dark humor throughout the film, a brutal honesty which is seriously unwarranted in areas, such as immediately following David's death, but this rightfully falls in line with his character. This is a man whose obsession with playing God alienates everyone's feelings but his own. His arrogance, his avid fixation on proving not to his former headmaster but to himself that he can get away with murder, proves to be his downfall.Phillip Morgan, played eloquently by then-relatively unknown Farley Granger, is the precise opposite of Brandon Shaw in every way. While he does partake in the experiment of killing David Kentley just for the thrill of getting away with it, he's dragged into more by Brandon and feels less of a desire or need to flaunt it in everyone's faces. He just wants to dispose of the body and be done with it once and for all. This of course would be the smart way to do it. Whether because of a lack of courage or his unwillingness to upset his `relationship' with Brandon, he doesn't. This adds further tension to his already guilt racked conscience, something Brandon sincerely lacks, leading him to take up heavy drinking and chain smoking to ease his troubled mind. Sadly these serve as tell-tale signs for a genius like Rupert to pick up on that something is amiss.While seen only for the first few brief seconds of the picture after the opening credits, his presence is felt nonetheless throughout the entire film. Similar to how Janet Leigh's early demise in Psycho two decades later reverberated throughout the story, so does Hogan's, though certainly less memorably. The presence of his `coffin' in the middle of the room amidst the social get-together mirrors Edgar Allen Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart for Phillip with the reemergence of the murder weapon, the rope with which David was strangled to death, adding only further burden to his guilt.To this day Rope remains one of director Alfred Hitchcock's most enduring and innovative motion picture drama. It stands as his first film to be filmed entirely in Technicolor. Although he would on occasion revert back to black-and-white in cases of budgetary constraints, Psycho the most likely famous example of this, as well as his nostalgia for artistic value, it showed once more he could adapt his art with the changing times as easily or better then anyone else in the field. With the exception of the opening credits, Rope is shot on one solitary set located within a soundstage, much as though you were watching a play performed on stage in front of you. Regardless of the confined space the performances occupy, the atmospheric tension is nothing short of electrifying all the way to the very end. In addition, Hitchcock creates the illusion, with some success, of one continuous shot. In reality, however, the one-hundred and eight minute motion picture was broken down into ten segments each ranging in length from four  minutes to just over ten minutes. It is rather obvious to audiences today that whenever a performer or a piece of furniture is moved in way of the camera so that it covers up the entire screen that it is Hitchcock's way of covering up splits in the film segments. Nonetheless, it proved at least a reasonably effective film technique that he used once more in filming Under Capricorn for Transatlantic Pictures.It is hard, then as it is today, not to pick up on the homosexual overtones of Rope. The closeness and quasi-intimacy Brandon and Phillip share together especially early on after they have killed David and stuffed his body inside the trunk suggest they are sharing a sexual liaison with one another. Brandon however can be viewed more as bi-sexual in nature as dialogue from him suggests that he had a short-lived relationship with David's current girlfriend and soon to be fianc&eacute;e, Janet Walker. In an ironic bit of taste, director Alfred Hitchcock cast John Dall and Farley Granger, both homosexuals, to play the roles of two gay students. Original choices were Cary Grant, long rumored to be bi-sexual, as Rupert and Montgomery Clift who after accepting the role backed out of the picture out of fear of being exposed as a homosexual. It is unknown whether James Stewart who replaced Grant as Rupert knew of the homoerotic overtones of his character or the film in general. However, any suggestion that Rupert is a homosexual is lost in Stewart's performance. In addition, screenwriter Arthur Laurents was gay and in his published memoirs admitted to having a sexual relationship with actor Farley Granger. Much of the homoerotic dialogue and choreography of Patrick Hamilton's original play were cut from the final print of the film but Hitchcock however was able to keep the suggestion in the minds of audiences with the memories of Leopold and Loeb still fresh in their minds.",4,The Moose Hole - Murder or Justifiable Homicide?,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,8498,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Rope',

203934,A1OUHW8VG89Q0Z,6300183580,"Miho Hirono ""ex-musician""","[3, 5]","Rope, you can call that it is a great Hitchcock's experiment, or you may call that it is a nice play-like-movie inspired by Leopold & Loeb case.The most interesting and important character in the movie is a professor Rupert played by James Stewart. His position is like on a borderline. At the first appearance he seems not to believe anything in the world. He doubts and laughs everything, especially common sense. Then he tends to make ordinary people uncomfortable. That makes Brandon believe Rupert is his side, supper human's, as Brandon describes, side.A theme of this play is a moral. It is very unusual and also effective to show this kind theme through a character like Rupert. Let's say Mr. Skepiticism speaks moral.I wonder how many people are attracted by such moral story nowadays. People, including myself, are more likely attracted by unhealthy, king and slave relationship between two wealthy, smart and good-looking young men and how they plan and commit the crime, and the shocking end of their relationship (one of them, Loeb, Brandon in the movie, was killed in a prison).The other thing in the movie fascinates me is music by Poulenc, a French composer. Actually that is the most fascinates me. And I tried to find out what title of the music, that is Perpetual Movement No. 1. I love it. That scene, While Phillip plays the music, he is so afraid of the crime but trys to hide, and Ruppert asks questions and closes to him, lighting on and off, you can see the brilliant tension between the two characters with sensitive music.",4,Skepiticism speaks moral,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1549,"['Rope', 'can', 'call', 'great', 'Hitchcock', 'experiment', 'may', 'call', 'nice', 'play-like-movie', 'inspired', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'most', 'interesting', 'important', 'character', 'movie', 'professor', 'Rupert', 'played', 'James', 'Stewart', 'position', 'borderline', 'first', 'appearance', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'world', 'everything', 'especially', 'common', 'sense', 'Then', 'make', 'ordinary', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'Brandon', 'believe', 'Rupert', 'side', 'supper', 'human', 'Brandon', 'side.A', 'theme', 'play', 'moral', 'very', 'unusual', 'also', 'effective', 'show', 'kind', 'theme', 'character', 'Rupert', 'Let', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Skepiticism', 'moral.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'attracted', 'such', 'moral', 'story', 'nowadays', 'People', 'including', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'attracted', 'unhealthy', 'king', 'slave', 'relationship', 'two', 'wealthy', 'smart', 'good-looking', 'young', 'men', 'how', 'plan', 'commit', 'crime', 'shocking', 'end', 'relationship', 'one', 'Loeb', 'Brandon', 'movie', 'was', 'killed', 'prison', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'music', 'Poulenc', 'French', 'composer', 'Actually', 'most', 'fascinates', 'tried', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'title', 'music', 'Perpetual', 'Movement', 'No', '1', 'love', 'scene', 'Phillip', 'music', 'so', 'afraid', 'crime', 'trys', 'hide', 'Ruppert', 'asks', 'questions', 'closes', 'lighting', 'off', 'can', 'see', 'brilliant', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'sensitive', 'music']",N/A

First time round of course you get caught up in the whole 'no edits' thing because chances are quite high somebody has told you about how Hitchcock experimented with just running the reels to their end and cutting only when he required a reel change.  You undoubtably go into this movie with that in mind and are quite determined to find flaws... ultimatly for the first ten - twenty minutes you do so, but then you forget and just watch it because its a really thrilling story.  Set inside the three rooms (plus entrance hall) of a 1940s New York apartment, it never leaves.  In fact it barely leaves the sitting room where the trunk stands dominating the forground, concealing the body of young David from the party guests eating off his coffin.The movie finishes and you realise 'hey, I forgot to look for the edits!'  So you watch it again, this time having been captured by the chilling and albeit slightly sick story of murder commited for sake of murder, you are sure you will not miss a thing this time.  But then you start noticing the comedy that you didn't quite pick up first time.  Especially David's girlfriend Janet, she is quite a remarkable character, quirky, uncomfortable and strangely attractive even though she says the word 'chum' far too many times.  And also Rupert, played by the legendary James Stewart, his interaction with the other characters is priceless, in particular the way he makes fun of women's discussion techniques and how they don't really say anything worthwhile but yet they know exactly what they are talking about.  All of a sudden the movie is over and yet again you've forgotten to take note of Hitchcock's edits.  Keep trying, and eventually you'll see what the fuss is about, but by then you don't care because you've fallen in love with the movie as a piece of Hitchcock genius.I would suggest avoiding the 'Rope Unleashed' making of simply because it doesn't really tell you anything about how it was made, it just talks about how the two main characters are homosexual.  You can take that as fact or not, either way it doesn't change the story any, and to be honest until I watched that doc I hadn't noticed it.",5,Don't get too Fixated on the Editing Style!,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2297,"['Rope', 'great', 'piece', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'First', 'time', 'round', 'course', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'whole', 'edits', 'thing', 'chances', 'are', 'quite', 'high', 'somebody', 'told', 'how', 'Hitchcock', 'experimented', 'just', 'running', 'reels', 'end', 'cutting', 'only', 'when', 'required', 'reel', 'change', 'undoubtably', 'go', 'movie', 'mind', 'are', 'quite', 'determined', 'find', 'flaws', 'ultimatly', 'first', 'ten', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'do', 'so', 'then', 'forget', 'just', 'watch', 'really', 'thrilling', 'story', 'Set', 'three', 'rooms', 'entrance', 'hall', '1940s', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'never', 'fact', 'barely', 'sitting', 'room', 'where', 'trunk', 'dominating', 'forground', 'concealing', 'body', 'young', 'David', 'party', 'guests', 'eating', 'off', 'coffin.The', 'movie', 'finishes', 'realise', ""'hey"", 'forgot', 'look', 'edits', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'having', 'been', 'captured', 'chilling', 'albeit', 'slightly', 'sick', 'story', 'murder', 'commited', 'sake', 'murder', 'are', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'thing', 'time', 'then', 'start', 'noticing', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Especially', 'David', 'girlfriend', 'Janet', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'character', 'quirky', 'uncomfortable', 'strangely', 'attractive', 'even', 'word', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'also', 'Rupert', 'played', 'legendary', 'James', 'Stewart', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters', 'priceless', 'particular', 'way', 'fun', 'women', 'discussion', 'techniques', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'yet', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'sudden', 'movie', 'yet', 'again', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'take', 'note', 'Hitchcock', 'edits', 'Keep', 'trying', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'movie', 'piece', 'Hitchcock', 'genius.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'avoiding', ""'Rope"", 'Unleashed', 'making', 'simply', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'anything', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'talks', 'how', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'homosexual', 'can', 'take', 'fact', 'not', 'way', ""n't"", 'change', 'story', 'be', 'honest', 'watched', 'doc', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed']",N/A

203937,ADK6XWZTNAOE,6300183580,newtonbosswell,"[44, 47]","Based on an actual murder case and directed by legendary director Alfred Hitchcock, Rope tells the story of two very close, well to do roommates Phillip and Brandon who strangle David, an old school chum, just for kicks.  To further increase the exhilaration of their dastardly deed, the duo deem it delicious to desecrate the dead by placing his body into a chest and serving their dinner party guests a banquet on its decorated top. The guests of honor at this most perverse soir&eacute;e include their former prep school professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), the murder victim's parents, his fianc&eacute;, and her former boyfriend.  This tapestry provides tension for Phillip as he is nervous about being caught and questions abound as to David's whereabouts. Interestingly, Brandon feels smug even justified as he views the act of murder to be relegated to a select superior few.Rope explores Nietzsche's concept of the &quot;&uuml;bermensch&quot; or &quot;superman&quot; in which society's people are divided into two groups.  Those who believe in the concepts of right and wrong and behave accordingly are deemed inferior beings and therefore unnecessary. While those who are enlightened enough to realize that one is free to act according to their own volition because there are no such primitive or external constraints on behavior are deemed superior.  In this worldview, homicide is justifiable because the intellectually superior are actually bettering society by eliminating the inferior and their drain on its resources.  The story comes to a head when Professor Cadell who taught Phillip and Brandon these nihilistic concepts begins to suspect that they practiced what he preached by killing David.Rope was shot with eight; 10-minute reels to give the illusion of one seamless, continuous take.  This forces the viewer to pay attention to every word and provides an eerie feeling that he/she is a witness to the murder and is a guest at the dinner party.  What also drives the film is its witty if not macabre dialogue that is punctuated with puns, innuendoes and double entendre. It is also interesting to watch the professor engage Phillip and Brandon in the proverbial game of cat and mouse. Likewise, the characters are richly developed and deep.Rope is Hitchcock's most underrated and unappreciated film.  Which is a shame because I believe Rope poses some very provocative questions.  Is there sanctity to human life?  Are all human beings equal? Is murder ever justifiable? Is there right and wrong?  Is moral absolutism an outmoded idea in which only the weak and dumb subscribe? Is a teacher responsible for his/her students' actions?

There is virtually no action and the  film is very much like a play, but Hitchcock wants to keep you close, sitting in your seat, confronted with a drama that plays out in words, drawing you in where you can't escape.The two pampered and immensely wealthy young men,  the prototypes of Leopold (Phillip) and Brandon (Loeb) strangle a young man, &#8220;David&#8221; in their posh New York apartment, put his body in a large chest and hold a party for the dead boy's friends and family, the buffet being laid out right on top of the chest. One of the guests is the boys' former professor who had taught them the fundamentals of Nietzsche's philosophy which the young men take out of context, considering themselves above morality, above judgment, supermen for whom the laws governing good and evil do not exist. Mediocrities like David simply occupy space and should be removed. During the party the professor becomes suspicious because of the absence of David and because of remarks by the two young murderers during the party. When the two students engage him in a discussion about Nietschian  philosophy, the professor, played superbly by Jimmy Stewart, begins to put two and two together.The personalities of Brandon and Phillip are molded from the real murderers. Brandon is cynical, narcissistic, and cruel while Phillip is his satellite, a talented piano player, but weak, totally under the power of Brandon. Loeb was handsome and Leopold decidedly plain, so Farley Granger with his beautiful face, perhaps is too much of an Adonis to resemble Leopold at least physically. However, as the hesitant acolyte, he handles the part well.  The two men are homosexuals but the subject is handled delicately.There are no special effects in &#8220;Rope-  what you see is what you get and you will no doubt wonder, as generations have  after the real crime (the murder of Bobby Franks in 1924)-  why?

It is his first technicolor film and it is supposed to appear as one long shot, essentially a one-act parlor play on film.  This offers a window into Hitch's genius:  he was constantly trying to push the envelope and found many ways to do so.  (Due to the ten-minute limit of a reel, he has to fade into dark objects to change each reel.The plot of the film is fairly taut:  with the opening scene a murder by strangulation, the psychological tension builds, first as to whether they can get away with it, and then to how it will end.  This is better than average, as anything the Hitch does achieves at least that, but it isn't very fun to watch and certainly not worthy of multiple re-viewings.  So it left me pretty tepid.  That being said, the acting is also above average, with the young Jimmy Stewart in a solid dramatic performance and the others, esp. Farley, also excellent.The version that I saw has wonderful followup interviews with Farley and the screenwriter Arthur Laurents, who is surprisingly critical.  In particular, Laurents argues that Hitch should not have revealed that they were actual murderers until the end; I would agree with that idea.  Also, Laurents emphasizes the gay themes in the film and play, which were downplayed due to the mores of that time, also very interesting.Recommended, but I would rent it rather than buy it.

203949,A16QODENBJVUI1,6300183580,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Many people are today unaware that in the late 1940s Hitchcock went through a bit of a dead period.  Between NOTORIOUS, released in 1946 but completed earlier, and STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951), Hitchcock made no films that are generally regarded as among his greatest.  Of these, ROPE is the most interesting.  One of the five ""Lost Hitchcock"" films that were unavailable for a couple of decades, it is primarily interesting for the way that Hitchcock wants to see what he can do with a set of self-imposed limits.  Hitchcock at montage and editing, just as he was perhaps the screen's greatest master at the extended shot, but in ROPE he eliminated all montage and editing.  The entire film is a series of eight minute shots, that being the longest cameras at the time could shoot before running out of film.  The only editing, therefore, was planning a transition from one reel to another, either by having the camera zoom very close to someone's back, thereby producing a completely black screen, or by a standard cut and jump to another person.  It is fascinating figuring out how he deals with such problems as how to make the sky through the soundstage windows appear to be changing.  All in all, a very, fascinating film.Unfortunately, apart from the technical delights of the film, it is far from one of Hitchcock's best.  It is by no means a bad film, but he probably made twenty that were better.  The acting is very professional, but it all feels very, very much like a filmed play.  Several of the performances lack the subtlety that we associate with film rather than stage acting.  Often the viewer is left with the impression that the actors are merely reciting lines, rather than portraying characters.  Jimmy Stewart, Cedric Hardwicke, and Farley Granger, who would star in Hitchcock's next masterpiece STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, stand out in an otherwise lackluster cast.But Hitchcock at less than his very best is very, very worth watching.  My belief has long been that Alfred Hitchcock and Ernst Lubitsch were the two most gifted directors to have spent most of their careers in Hollywood, and is the standard by which all other action, crime, and suspense directors must be judged.  So, in this film we see the Master at work, even if on one of his lesser creations.The events, of course, were loosely based on the Leopold and Loeb murders, in which two University of Chicago undergraduates murdered a younger male for approximately the same reasons found in ROPE.",4,Technically fascinating filming of a great stage play,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,2480,"['Many', 'people', 'are', 'today', 'unaware', 'late', '1940s', 'Hitchcock', 'went', 'bit', 'dead', 'period', 'Between', 'NOTORIOUS', 'released', '1946', 'completed', 'earlier', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', '1951', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'films', 'are', 'generally', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'ROPE', 'most', 'interesting', 'One', 'five', 'Lost', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'were', 'unavailable', 'couple', 'decades', 'primarily', 'interesting', 'way', 'Hitchcock', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'set', 'self-imposed', 'limits', 'Hitchcock', 'montage', 'editing', 'just', 'was', 'perhaps', 'screen', 'greatest', 'master', 'extended', 'shot', 'ROPE', 'eliminated', 'montage', 'editing', 'entire', 'film', 'series', 'eight', 'minute', 'shots', 'being', 'longest', 'cameras', 'time', 'could', 'shoot', 'running', 'film', 'only', 'editing', 'therefore', 'was', 'planning', 'transition', 'one', 'reel', 'either', 'having', 'camera', 'zoom', 'very', 'close', 'someone', 'back', 'thereby', 'producing', 'completely', 'black', 'screen', 'standard', 'cut', 'jump', 'person', 'fascinating', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'such', 'problems', 'how', 'make', 'sky', 'soundstage', 'appear', 'be', 'changing', 'very', 'fascinating', 'film.Unfortunately', 'apart', 'technical', 'delights', 'film', 'far', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'bad', 'film', 'probably', 'made', 'twenty', 'were', 'better', 'acting', 'very', 'professional', 'feels', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'filmed', 'play', 'Several', 'performances', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'associate', 'film', 'rather', 'stage', 'acting', 'Often', 'viewer', 'left', 'impression', 'actors', 'are', 'merely', 'reciting', 'lines', 'rather', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Cedric', 'Hardwicke', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'who', 'would', 'star', 'Hitchcock', 'next', 'masterpiece', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'stand', 'out', 'otherwise', 'lackluster', 'cast.But', 'Hitchcock', 'less', 'very', 'best', 'very', 'very', 'worth', 'watching', 'belief', 'long', 'been', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'were', 'two', 'most', 'gifted', 'directors', 'have', 'spent', 'most', 'careers', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'other', 'action', 'crime', 'suspense', 'directors', 'must', 'be', 'judged', 'So', 'film', 'see', 'Master', 'work', 'even', 'one', 'lesser', 'creations.The', 'events', 'course', 'were', 'loosely', 'based', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'murders', 'two', 'University', 'Chicago', 'undergraduates', 'murdered', 'younger', 'male', 'approximately', 'same', 'reasons', 'found', 'ROPE']",N/A

At college, they were taught by Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) who, having read a little too much Nietzsche, explained to them there that, for truly superior people, murder need be no crime. They have taken this ugly lesson just a little too much to heart and so, just for fun, they kill their friend David. Then, his body hidden in a chest, they hold a dinner party for his parents, his girlfriend, the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend and Cadell himself. David is invited too, but of course, he doesn't show up. But Philip, especially, is decidedly nervous and, as the evening progresses, Cadell starts to smell a rat...Technically, this is one of Hitchcock's most consciously experimental pieces of film. There is no music at all, except over the credits and in a couple of scenes where Philip plays the piano. And it is made to at least appear to have been shot in a single very long take. In fact it is not and there are a few cuts that maintain an appearance of seamlessness by taking place as the shot passes across some dark surface like the back of a jacket. This contributes nicely to the tension. It does has a certain awkward consequence however in that the action is thereby set in real time and it takes some suspension of disbelief to accept that a society dinner party might last about 45 minutes from start to finish. (It also means that, whether you think this is a movie worth buying or just one to rent, it would be particularly criminal to watch it on TV with commercial interruptions.) Another nice technical touch exploits the location of Brandon and Philip's apartment high in New York and close to some neon signage. For much of the film it is daytime outside but in the scenes towards the end as a climax approaches, a surreal, nightmarish atmosphere is created by the slow by constant modulations of colouring of the light that result.This is Hitchcock's first movie collaboration with James Stewart who does an excellent job playing a smart intellectual type who gets a nasty shock when he finds two of his students putting into action the clever sounding but disgusting ideas he thought he was so smart in expounding. It's a rather nice study in the perils of a shallow predeliction for novel, supposedly ""advanced"", moral thinking. (Brandon and Philip, arrogant patricians killing for fun, will have recalled to an American audience of the time the famous `20s case of Leopold and Loeb.) The movie is a interesting moral fable and also a nice, if slightly stagy thriller. It's not one of Hitchcock's greats but it's certainly no dud.

It doesn't have the color or visual attractiveness of so many other Hitchcock films, but what it lacks in aesthetic grandeur is more than made up for in suspense and intelligence.As a philosophy student, I LOVED the premise here.  So many times have I listened to students and professors alike who take a &quot;sophisticated&quot; attitude towards the thought of men like Nietzsche, always approaching the topic as &quot;theoretical&quot; or &quot;in the abstract.&quot;  But when one applies a theory or a philosophy to real life, then one finds out whether it really has value (and honestly, how many of us would subscribe to the idea of 'ubermen,' beyond good and evil, without immediately assuming that title for ourselves?).  But a tough-minded application of just such a &quot;sophisticated&quot; theory is precisely what Hitchcock does, brilliantly, in ROPE.What really knocks this fantastic premise out of the ballpark is the inclusion of the one-and-only Jimmy Stewart, who represents, initially, that slightly condescending, intellectual snobbery that the movie ultimately attacks.  We are taken aback by Stewart's character's words, precisely because Stewart is such a likeable actor.  Because it's Stewart, we tend to listen to the character's obscene ideology with the same forgiveness and uncomfortable snicker as some of the party guests to whom he's speaking, though we've just witnessed his words in murderous action.  So when Stewart's character comes to his senses upon the realization that a murder has been committed, it is gut-wrenching and powerful.What a blessing, what a treat, that this movie has been restored and presented in such a terrific fashion on DVD.

203960,A35GHITTG3WX7E,6300183580,Taran Wanderer,"[5, 6]","Alfred Hitchcock's timeless (Yet forgotten) masterpiece, ""Rope"" is probably one of my all-time favorite films, it's good, dark comedy and drama, the acting is excellent and the story is cold and chilling and one that you won't easily forget.The story is set in a rather large and spacious apartment in New York, where two young college students, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger), have just committed the ""perfect murder,"" innocently inviting a friend named David Kentley for a glass of whine and killing him at the spot, strangulated by a piece of white rope then stuffing his body into an old chest.  Instantly, Phillip regrets the whole thing, but Brandon isn't yet happy, he wants more excitement and wants to take his scheme to the limit, to achieve this, he throws a party supposedly to bid farewell to Phillip and show David's father a few old first edition books.The guests arrive, David's girlfriend, Janet Walker, his friend and rival, Kenneth Lawrence, his father, Henry Kentley, his aunt, Mrs. Anita Atwater and old school professor Rupert Cadell (Played by the legendary James Stewart), who begins to grow increasingly suspicious of David's mysterious disappearance as the party goes on.The film features outstanding actors, Cedric Hardwicke as Mr. Kentley, Constance Collier as Mrs. Atwater, Douglas Dick as Kenneth, Joan Chandler as Janet, Dick Hogan as David and Edith Evanson who plays one of the greatest characters, the housemaid Mrs. Wilson.  One thing that makes Rope so unique is the fact that it happens in ""real time"" meaning that there are no scene changes and although it is quite obvious what techniques have been used for this, it is still amusing.  The story isn't one of Hitchcock's most thrilling, but some scenes are pure suspense and the movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.I'd recommend this movie to Hitchcock fans and filmlovers who want a good crime/mystery film.

203962,AV5G37VFE5NVD,6300183580,Tom Benton,"[3, 3]","""Rope,"" Alfred Hitchcock's first color film, is an adaptation of the play by Patrick Hamilton, which was re-named ""Rope's End"" when it hit Broadway.  It is also loosely based upon the real-life Leopold/Loeb case.  Like Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" ""Rope"" feels like it was created for the stage, using only one set and virtually no music.  One of the most intriguing aspects of the film is that it was filmed in ""real time,"" meaning that the 80 minutes which the film spans is intended to be a straight 80 minutes for the characters, though it has been discussed that the storyline actually occurs over about 100 minutes.  Nevertheless, it's the continous takes which make the film so spectacular.  The movie was edited from about seven 10-minute takes.  At the end of each of these takes the camera focuses on some dark or black spot, originally intended to give theater operators a chance to change the reel and to mask the fact that there was any editing done at all.  It works well.The story is classic Hitchcock: two prep school pals decide to commit a murder just for the sake of doing so.  They plan everything to perfection, and for the finishing touch, they invite a group of people to dinner, feasting upon the chest in which the corpse is contained.  Among those invited are the parents of the deceased, his would-be fiance, his best friend, and the murderous duo's eccentric old professor, who they think would approve of their scheme.  John Dall is the driving force behind this whole ghastly operation, and he overplays his role with a reckless pompousness.  His best friend and reluctant partner-in-crime is Farley Granger, who is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Unquestionably the highlight of the cast is James Stewart as their former professor, Rupert, who states that murder is not a crime, but a priveledge.  This is one of my favorite performances from Mr. Stewart.  He plays his part with a devilishly easygoing, intelligent suavete and far more reserve than you would usually see from Stewart.Considering the movie was released in 1948, the fact that the script retains the implied homosexuality between the murderers from Hamilton's play is a bold move.  The script does omit the knowledge that Stewart's character had an affair with one of his old students, a good move because if it had been kept the audience would feel considerably less sympathy for Stewart than they do at the film's end.  Interestingly, Hitchcock chose to open the film with the murder, leaving no doubt that a murder was in fact committed, while in Hamilton's play we don't know whether the duo actually went through with the murder or not until its end.  It seems uncharacteristic of Hitchcock that he should decide against so artful and suspenseful a technique as leaving his audience questioning whether the murder is real or not.Don't begin your exploration of Hitchcock's works with this movie.  Opt instead for something like ""Vertigo"" or even Hitchcock's previous masterpiece, ""Notorious,"" which is cleverly referenced at one point in the film when Stewart's character names the one film he enjoyed, ""that new thing with Ingrid Bergman.""  One of the 5 ""lost Hitchcocks,"" ""Rope"" is not one of the Master's masterpieces, but it is one of his finer and most interesting works.  The ""real time"" technique is fascinating, the story is unmistakably Hitchcockian, and Stewart's performance is among his best, and that alone is enough to make the film worth a watch.",4,"""You're quite a good chicken strangler as I recall""",1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,3484,"['Rope', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'color', 'film', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Patrick', 'Hamilton', 'was', 're-named', 'Rope', 'End', 'when', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'also', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'Leopold/Loeb', 'case', 'Hitchcock', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Rope', 'feels', 'was', 'created', 'stage', 'using', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'virtually', 'music', 'One', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'real', 'time', 'meaning', '80', 'minutes', 'film', 'spans', 'intended', 'be', 'straight', '80', 'minutes', 'characters', 'been', 'discussed', 'storyline', 'actually', '100', 'minutes', 'Nevertheless', 'continous', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'seven', '10-minute', 'end', 'camera', 'dark', 'black', 'spot', 'originally', 'intended', 'give', 'theater', 'operators', 'chance', 'change', 'reel', 'mask', 'fact', 'was', 'editing', 'done', 'well.The', 'story', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'two', 'prep', 'school', 'pals', 'decide', 'commit', 'murder', 'just', 'sake', 'doing', 'so', 'plan', 'everything', 'perfection', 'finishing', 'touch', 'invite', 'group', 'people', 'dinner', 'feasting', 'chest', 'corpse', 'contained', 'invited', 'are', 'parents', 'deceased', 'would-be', 'fiance', 'best', 'friend', 'murderous', 'duo', 'eccentric', 'old', 'professor', 'who', 'think', 'would', 'approve', 'scheme', 'John', 'Dall', 'driving', 'force', 'whole', 'ghastly', 'operation', 'role', 'reckless', 'pompousness', 'best', 'friend', 'reluctant', 'partner-in-crime', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'who', 'constantly', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Unquestionably', 'highlight', 'cast', 'James', 'Stewart', 'former', 'professor', 'Rupert', 'who', 'murder', 'not', 'crime', 'priveledge', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'Mr.', 'Stewart', 'part', 'devilishly', 'easygoing', 'intelligent', 'suavete', 'far', 'more', 'reserve', 'would', 'usually', 'see', 'Stewart.Considering', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1948', 'fact', 'script', 'implied', 'homosexuality', 'murderers', 'Hamilton', 'play', 'bold', 'move', 'script', 'omit', 'knowledge', 'Stewart', 'character', 'had', 'affair', 'one', 'old', 'students', 'good', 'move', 'had', 'been', 'kept', 'audience', 'would', 'feel', 'considerably', 'less', 'sympathy', 'Stewart', 'do', 'film', 'end', 'Interestingly', 'Hitchcock', 'chose', 'open', 'film', 'murder', 'leaving', 'doubt', 'murder', 'was', 'fact', 'committed', 'Hamilton', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'duo', 'actually', 'went', 'murder', 'not', 'end', 'uncharacteristic', 'Hitchcock', 'should', 'decide', 'so', 'artful', 'suspenseful', 'technique', 'leaving', 'audience', 'questioning', 'murder', 'real', 'not.Do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'exploration', 'Hitchcock', 'works', 'movie', 'Opt', 'instead', 'something', 'Vertigo', 'even', 'Hitchcock', 'previous', 'masterpiece', 'Notorious', 'cleverly', 'referenced', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Stewart', 'character', 'one', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'new', 'thing', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'One', '5', 'lost', 'Hitchcocks', 'Rope', 'not', 'one', 'Master', 'masterpieces', 'one', 'finer', 'most', 'interesting', 'works', 'real', 'time', 'technique', 'fascinating', 'story', 'unmistakably', 'Hitchcockian', 'Stewart', 'performance', 'best', 'alone', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'watch']",N/A

It's flawed to be sure but this unusual experiment was shot in long takes an unusual approach for Hitchcock. The story was inspired by the Leopold and Loeb murder case and their obsession with the superman theories of Nietzsche.Philip (Farley Granger)and Brandon (John Dall)have committed the murder of an old classmate for the thrill of it. They invite over mutual friends, the father and mother of the victim and their old prep school master Rupert (Jimmy Stewart)who first introduced them to Nietzche's theories. They drape a table cloth over the trunk where the dead body rests.Written by Arthur Laurents and Hume Cronyn from the play Rope's End by Patrick Hamilton, Rope allows Hitchcock to indulge in a number of unusual cinematic experiments. It was Hitchcock's first movie to be shot in color and the entire 80 minute film is shot on one set with the skyline gradually changing. If Hitchcock had gotten his ideal cast the film might have been quite different; originally Hitchcock wanted Carey Grant for the role Stewart player and Montgomery Clift as Brandon.The transfer is good although there is some edge enhancement and some analog and compression artifacts (although they aren't a huge problem). The vivid 3 strip Technicolor process comes to life on this DVD. The colors are pretty close to the version I saw screened. I should note, though, that I originally saw Rope at the UCLA Theater Arts Archive in black and white (a color copy wasn't available) on a Movieola and it was a nitrate print so I'm comparing it to versions that were released much later than the original.While Rope isn't a perfect Hitchcock excursion, it's an enjoyable and admirable one that features a number of interesting visuals, strong performances and an interesting thought provoking story. The extras on this edition are quite nice as well including a feaurette entitled Rope Unleased, production photos and notes.

By toeing the middle ground, however, Hitch creates a film that takes a suspenseful plot kernel and overshadows it with social class psychobabble.For a basic plot summary, ""Rope"" sees two young men (John Dall & Farley Granger) carry out their view of the ""perfect murder"" by killing a fellow chum and hiding him in a wooden chest in their living room while throwing a party that night.  At the party, a former preparatory instructor (James Stewart) becomes suspicious of the pair and starts snooping around.The suspense angle of this movie is obvious, as the audience knows the body is in the trunk in the living room and thus anything could possibly happen.  Hitchcock manages to make this a legitimately suspenseful (as he is best at) on multiple occasions, providing the best parts of the film.Sadly, there is just something ""off"" about the overall experience.  It is as if, in taking the play and making it a film, the producers somehow lost a key element of the narrative structure.  All the talk about class and ""the right to murder"" is present, but it just doesn't quite click into place well enough to development the characters or make the whole experience work.  Simply put, it's like a lot of the original play was ""lost in translation"".Overall, ""Rope"" is a decent Hitchcock flick that provides some suspense and great acting (especially the two leads and, of course, Stewart).  However, the motives behind the whole experiment seem a bit lost from the original English play (either that or it just doesn't have much coherency altogether).
