Mary secretly desires to be a dancer, stowing away to class hidden behind the mirror, where only she can see how good she really is; that is until teen idol Joey Parker(Drew Seeley) comes back to his 'roots' to finish high school and be a 'normal teenager'.The high school goes crazy when Joey arrives, especially when he announces his upcoming contest for the best dancer to dance with him in an upcoming project. Post the school's black and white dance where Mary and Joey tango together he can't forget about his mystery girl, and is looking for her with her music player she left at the scene of the crime.I do have a number of complaints, the foremost being the sheer fact that along with the previous 'Cinderella Story' I am not stupid enough to believe that wearing a small mask hides who you are. Last I checked philosophers have always deemed the eyes to be the windows to the soul, and I can see clearly that you are in that spicy red dress Selena. I can clearly see that it is you who is dancing with Drew, it is not difficult. (Same goes for you Miss. Duff!)Also the fact that Seeley is 10 years older then Gomez freaks me out more then just a little, and no wonder the complete lack of chemistry all together. (What happened there?)I will admit that some of the songs are cute and catchy like 'new classic' and 'tell me something I don't know'. Although I may be ashamed to listen to them frequently, Seeley's Timberlake-esque vocals plus that typical pop sound are a good(if tired) combination.Overall it's a cute, predictable movie that is perfect for it's target audience, which can't be said for some of the others in it's category.",3,You may live in the 90210 but you're still just...a zero.,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,1932,"['2008', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'cute', 'child-friendly', 'story', 'washed', 'up', 'pop-star', 'named', 'Dominique', 'deceased', 'dancer', 'left', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'custody', 'now', 'course', 'away', 'doing', 'terrible', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'vacuuming', 'driveway', 'Mary', 'secretly', 'be', 'dancer', 'stowing', 'away', 'class', 'hidden', 'mirror', 'where', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'teen', 'idol', 'Joey', 'Parker', 'Drew', 'Seeley', 'back', ""'roots"", 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'be', ""'normal"", ""teenager'.The"", 'high', 'school', 'crazy', 'when', 'Joey', 'especially', 'when', 'upcoming', 'contest', 'best', 'dancer', 'dance', 'upcoming', 'project', 'Post', 'school', 'black', 'white', 'dance', 'where', 'Mary', 'Joey', 'tango', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'mystery', 'girl', 'looking', 'music', 'player', 'left', 'scene', 'crime.I', 'do', 'have', 'number', 'complaints', 'foremost', 'being', 'sheer', 'fact', 'previous', 'Story', 'am', 'not', 'stupid', 'enough', 'believe', 'wearing', 'small', 'mask', 'hides', 'who', 'are', 'Last', 'checked', 'philosophers', 'have', 'always', 'deemed', 'eyes', 'be', 'windows', 'soul', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'are', 'spicy', 'red', 'dress', 'Selena', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'who', 'dancing', 'Drew', 'not', 'difficult', 'Same', 'Miss', 'Duff', 'Also', 'fact', 'Seeley', '10', 'years', 'older', 'then', 'Gomez', 'freaks', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'little', 'wonder', 'complete', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'together', 'What', 'happened', 'will', 'admit', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'catchy', ""'new"", 'classic', ""'tell"", 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'may', 'be', 'ashamed', 'listen', 'frequently', 'Seeley', 'Timberlake-esque', 'vocals', 'typical', 'pop', 'sound', 'are', 'good', 'tired', 'combination.Overall', 'cute', 'predictable', 'movie', 'perfect', 'target', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'others', 'category']",N/A

1170957,AP3B615GM191G,B001B7CO0A,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","For the most part, I consider the Disney Channel (and all its programming and outlets) to be a bit too ""in your face"" and loud in terms of shows, acting, promotions, and pretty much everything else.  When one of ""their own"" become stars, they are (at least for a short time) what the world is talking about.  Yet, every once in awhile, there are shows (e.g. Drake and Josh, Wizards of Waverly Place) and actors (e.g. Josh Peck, Selena Gomez) that I can legitimately enjoy with my younger siblings.  ""Another Cinderella Story"" is one of those shows.Starring Gomez, at what probably will amount to the height of her ""Wizards"" fame, this film channels the classic children's story ""Cinderella"" and gives it a culturally relevant twist.  When a young girl (Gomez) lucks into an exclusive dance with the school's most handsome boy (Andrew Seeley) but then must rush home to please her overbearing stepmother (anything sound familiar yet?!), an I-Pod (ala slipper) is the only link between their special moment.  Thus, the remainder of the film centers on both boy and girl finding each other and building a relationship.This movie is clearly superior to its Hilary Duff-starring predecessor in the areas of acting, energy, and excitement:Acting-wise, Gomez can hold her own with anyone, while Seeley, rather surprisingly, almost steals the show with his screen time.  Obviously hired to be the ""leading hunk"", Seeley turns in a genuine performance.  The supporting cast is also just stereotypically goofy enough to be considered ""true Disney"", but also too stereotypical to really offend anyone (in the High School Musical mold).In terms of energy and excitement, the fact that the film is set to a back-drop of hip-hop dancing automatically gives it a bit of spunk and flash.  Both Gomez and Seeley (or their stunt doubles...whatever the case may be) can really rip it up on the dance floor, only adding to the chemistry between them.Thus, if you have children (or younger siblings) that adore pretty much all Disney fare, fear not...for this is a film that can be enjoyed by you as well!  Though not an instant classic by any means, it is a solid little fun film that will have you singing its tunes and dancing to its catchy beats long after you push the ""STOP"" button.",4,"Here's ""Something You Don't Know""...This Is A Charming Film",1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,2267,"['most', 'part', 'consider', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'programming', 'outlets', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'face', 'loud', 'terms', 'shows', 'acting', 'promotions', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'When', 'one', 'own', 'become', 'stars', 'are', 'least', 'short', 'time', 'what', 'world', 'talking', 'once', 'awhile', 'are', 'shows', 'e.g', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'actors', 'e.g', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'can', 'legitimately', 'enjoy', 'younger', 'siblings', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'one', 'shows.Starring', 'Gomez', 'what', 'probably', 'will', 'amount', 'height', 'Wizards', 'fame', 'film', 'classic', 'children', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'culturally', 'relevant', 'twist', 'When', 'young', 'girl', 'Gomez', 'exclusive', 'dance', 'school', 'most', 'handsome', 'boy', 'Andrew', 'Seeley', 'then', 'must', 'rush', 'home', 'please', 'overbearing', 'stepmother', 'anything', 'sound', 'familiar', 'yet', 'I-Pod', 'ala', 'slipper', 'only', 'link', 'special', 'moment', 'Thus', 'remainder', 'film', 'centers', 'boy', 'girl', 'finding', 'other', 'building', 'relationship.This', 'movie', 'clearly', 'superior', 'Hilary', 'Duff-starring', 'predecessor', 'areas', 'acting', 'energy', 'excitement', 'Acting-wise', 'Gomez', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'anyone', 'Seeley', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'almost', 'show', 'screen', 'time', 'Obviously', 'hired', 'be', 'leading', 'hunk', 'Seeley', 'genuine', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'just', 'stereotypically', 'goofy', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'true', 'Disney', 'also', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'really', 'offend', 'anyone', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'mold', '.In', 'terms', 'energy', 'excitement', 'fact', 'film', 'set', 'back-drop', 'hip-hop', 'dancing', 'automatically', 'bit', 'spunk', 'flash', 'Gomez', 'Seeley', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'whatever', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'can', 'really', 'rip', 'up', 'dance', 'floor', 'only', 'adding', 'chemistry', 'them.Thus', 'have', 'children', 'younger', 'siblings', 'adore', 'pretty', 'much', 'Disney', 'fare', 'fear', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'instant', 'classic', 'means', 'solid', 'little', 'fun', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'singing', 'tunes', 'dancing', 'catchy', 'beats', 'long', 'push', 'STOP', 'button']",N/A
