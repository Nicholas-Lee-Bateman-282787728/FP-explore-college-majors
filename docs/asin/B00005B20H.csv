Sean Bean stars as Jason Locke, a gangster released from prison after a five year stint in the slammer for possesion of illegal substances.  The main character, Billy ( Kingston) is an ex-cab driver in an English city when he is suddenly hired to drive Locke around after being released from prison.  Eventually he becomes integrated into the gang, and witnesses several brtual murders when Jason begins to take revenge on his former cohorts whom he beleives took advantage of him while he was in prison.  Billy goes along for the ride.  Soon he joins the gang and is set up with a big pay check, and everything is great until Jason's girl begins to get in on the action.  All in all, an interesting film with a very spairing story line, but it isn't really needed.  Occasionally the thick British accents of all the actors can be hard to decipher, especially to an American audience, but what lacks in dialogue it makes up for in action.  The film is brutally violent, sometimes for almost no apparent reason, but all it does is reaffirm the bloody, gory modern British underworld.",4,"One brutal, tough punch",1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,1183,"['Alex', 'Kingston', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'British', 'gangster', 'flick', 'underworld', 'rules', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'stars', 'Jason', 'Locke', 'gangster', 'released', 'prison', 'five', 'year', 'stint', 'slammer', 'possesion', 'illegal', 'substances', 'main', 'character', 'Billy', 'Kingston', 'ex-cab', 'driver', 'English', 'city', 'when', 'suddenly', 'hired', 'drive', 'Locke', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'Eventually', 'integrated', 'gang', 'several', 'brtual', 'murders', 'when', 'Jason', 'take', 'revenge', 'former', 'cohorts', 'whom', 'took', 'advantage', 'was', 'prison', 'Billy', 'along', 'ride', 'gang', 'set', 'up', 'big', 'pay', 'check', 'everything', 'great', 'Jason', 'girl', 'get', 'action', 'interesting', 'film', 'very', 'spairing', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'really', 'needed', 'Occasionally', 'thick', 'British', 'accents', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'decipher', 'especially', 'American', 'audience', 'what', 'dialogue', 'up', 'action', 'film', 'brutally', 'violent', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'apparent', 'reason', 'reaffirm', 'bloody', 'gory', 'modern', 'British', 'underworld']",Essex Boys
580065,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00005B20H,Ernest Jagger,"[0, 1]","""Essex Boys"" is a very good British gangster flick. The main character Jason Locke (Sean Bean) has just been released from prison. After a very long stay, he finds that he is on the outside looking in. With the drug ecstasy making some of his former friends and acquaintances a fortune, he  decides that he wants in on the action. And not just a little action, but a partnership. However, he is asking for more than he bargained for.Enter John Dyke (Tom Wilkinson) who has already had his feel of prison; and although he is running drugs [on a low key basis] Jason Locke demands that he be made a partner with full entitlement to funds from the lucrative drug market. The problem is that Jason Locke is too wild in his ways, whereas John Dyke wants to be low key. Moreover, John has already stated that he doesn't ever want to see the inside of a prison again, and will do anything to see this never happens again: And for him, Jason Locke is a threat.Another character in the film, Billy (Creed-Miles) is the only sympathetic character in the film. He is not a killer or bad person, he just hangs out with the wrong crowd. He has been hired by Jason to be his driver. At the same time, he is an acquaintance of John Dyke. Events occur [no spoilers] in which Billy finds he is not safe anywhere. The film is great, and Sean Bean gives an outstanding performance as a hot-headed ex-con, who finds he has pushed John Dyke a little too far. Highly recommended.

It's a credit to the genre (or sub-genre) that Essex Boys is one of the better entries.That can be attributed to a very intelligent script, terrific acting (since when have British actors failed to deliver the goods?), and fast-paced directing--all of which speak of a keen understanding of exactly how to craft a thriller that moves the way it should.Sean Bean is outstanding here as Jason, an ugly-minded thug who's just been let out of the pen.  He finds his old mates, after settling a score in an especially violent scene, and together they set about raking in the pounds, primarily from drug dealing.  What they don't count on is Jason's wife Lisa who's the toughest and smartest of all.  Her plots and counterplots land her squarely in the femme fatale arena and it's a lot of fun to watch Alex Kingston, the actress who portrays her, strut her stuff.Also on hand are Billy Wiz, the naive driver who's conscripted into service for Jason, Lisa, and Billy's ex-mentor Mr. D., in an especially riveting performance by Tom Wilkinson, who did a great job in the film In the Bedroom.The ending is very far off from what anyone would expect; the plotting here shows off, as mentioned, just how smart the filmmakers--writer and director both--really are.A great addition to your crime flick set of films, Essex Boys bites, punches, stings, and packs a wallop.

580075,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00005B20H,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[29, 31]","Essex Boys is a 1999 ""gangster"" film that takes the viewer into the gritty, dangerous domain of Essex's drug-dealing underworld.  The story is narrated in part by a lad named Billy, a lowly (but fairly quick-witted) driver for the self-important kingpins, and though we don't see everything from Billy's vantage point, it is an effective and engaging means of presenting the story.  Though the characters and the story are pure fiction, the inspiration for the film came from the murder of three suspected drug dealers whose bodies were found in a Range Rover in Essex in 1995.  The story created around this real-life event is highly imaginative, plausible, gripping, and suspenseful.Sean Bean (Sharpe, Extremely Dangerous, Bravo Two Zero, The Fifteen Streets, Golden Eye), donning a cockney-flavoured Essex accent, is simply superb as the jealous, arrogant, mean-spirited, foul-mouthed Jason Locke, a drug-dealing thug who's just been released from prison (and who thinks he's God's gift to women).  He's one of those chaps, the girth of whose vocabulary is such that he'd easily be rendered speechless were he required to utter so much as one sentence without lacing it liberally with the ""F"" word.  There is not much at all to like about Locke.  He treats women like dirt and has little more respect for his colleagues.Those used to seeing Bean as an action hero will no doubt enjoy (if that is the right word!) seeing him in such a nasty role.  He is known for really internalizing his roles and becoming the character he's portraying; indeed, it's almost disturbing to see him here, for he simply exudes foulness.The film co-stars Alex Kingston (Moll Flanders) as Locke's feisty, shrewd, ambitious wife, Lisa.  Kingston is a very capable actress who is well-paired with Bean in this film.  Another familiar face is Tom Wilkinson (The Full Monty), who is wonderful as drug middle-man John Dyke.This is a gritty, violent film that doesn't hold back any punches in its depiction of the drug underworld.  It's a good story with a very satisfying ending.  It's a first-rate production and is consumately acted by all involved.
