You must be a Danny Trejo fan to enjoy the action plot with flying bullets and squirting blood from wounds. Danny is Danny, mean-looking bulldog face, few words, irrational macho determination to take on loads of opponents at the same time, and a happy trigger finger. But if you are a normal movie-viewer who's looking for &#34;quality&#34; action, realistic plot, and great acting, then this movie is not for you, for under those criteria this movie would get 1-star rating from me. Danny is Frank &#34;Bullet&#34; Marasco, an L.A. detective whose grandson has been kidnapped by a drug cartel which is making big demands for his release. Well, you know Danny Trejo, he fears nothing, so he goes after the bad guys, Jonathan Banks and Torsten Voges---two pretty ugly bad guys---and about a dozen others. It's a pleasure just watching how ugly they are, and mean-looking too. I am a big Danny Trejo fan and I loved the movie. My wife does not like Danny Trejo, and she hated it.

Frank goes on a rescue mission.I love Danny Trejo,films and it was nice to see him in a movie longer than two minutes. But let's face it. This was a bad script, with cliche filled stupidity and not in a good way. They made the lawyer (Julia Dietze) idiotic. There was a ridiculous cheap special effects blood splatter scene involving a golf club. The daughter (Tinsel Korey) ex-drug addict thing didn't work well with the rest of the film.The attempt to build Frank's character felt forced.Possible rental worthy for Trejo fans.Parental Guide: f-bombs.

1678919,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B00GMM10QI,Trejofan,"[0, 0]","Yes, I am a Trejo fan.  An extreme one, I admit. If you are a Trejo fan, this was a good story, with Mr. Trejo's performance being particularly good as he fights to save his grandson from criminals bent on preventing the execution of a death row inmate who deserves it. We even get to see him shirtless in an &#34;extreme fighting&#34; scene (Yay!)  This tough macho man shows his tender side when he deals with children, just as he did in the &#34;Spy Kids&#34; movies. Johnathan Banks, a graduate from &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; (can't remember if he shared screen time with &#34;Tortuga&#34;) plays the condemned man's dad, determined to both kill Frank Bullet (Mr. Trejo), and also frame him for the crime his son is being executed for. However either he had make up that was particularly unflattering purposely, or they didn't use make up on him at all because this man was a collage of old age spots and  other skin issues and discolorations.Since I doubt they would have painted these spots on him, perhaps they did this to add to his arch-baddy character. Also, in some scenes, they used background music that sounded like it was from 1970 or 80 movies--way outdated and seemingly inappropriate for the film and somewhat loud and distracting in some parts.  Matter of fact the sound was not very good in some scenes and the dialog difficult to hear. This seems to improve over the course of the movie. Yes there was a bit of violence and the body count was high. But, it was still a really good shoot-em-up drama.  I wish that John Savage, who played the governor had gotten a better hair cut as he just didn't strike me as governor material. He looked a bit scruffy.  I live in Oregon, and our Governor is from the country in Southern Oregon and wears cowboy boots and jeans with corduroy jackets at our capitol.  But he still has way better grooming and hair cuts than the alleged governor in this movie.
