723747,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00007149J,,"[8, 8]","The 1967 BBC version of ""The Forsyte Saga"" may have primitive, even laughable, production values compared with the 2002 remake. But in every other way, the original version is superior, by a wide margin. The 1967 version was a worldwide craze and began the proud tradition of British TV miniseries that gave us ""I, Claudius,"" ""Brideshead Revisited,"" ""Downton Abbey"" and so many others. The 2002 version, on the other hand, would have strangled the genre in its cradle, so dull and doughy it was.It's a little much, I grant you, for modern audiences to see the stock footage of Queen Victoria's funeral, the General Strike, etc., interweaved with the stagebound black-and-white scenes with the actors. But all of the actors--most of whom would become extremely familiar through subsequent miniseries--are absolutely first-rate, Producer Donald Wilson and his team of writers created 26 episodes stuffed with sparkling dialogue and meticulously detailed plot, just as Galsworthy would have wanted it.Of the performers in the newer version, the only one who came close to matching his counterpart in the original was Rupert Graves as Jo. (Kenneth More was great, but so is Graves.) As Soames and Irene, however, Eric Porter and Nyree Dawn Porter tap-danced all over Damian Lewis and Gina McKee, in rugby cleats. Both the Porters (no relation to each other, by either marriage or blood) were uniquely, magically right for the roles of Soames and Irene; their close-ups at the end of Episode 6, which is of course the crucial plot point of the entire series, are perhaps the greatest of any performers in the history of television. Both actors created enormous sympathy for characters who, to say the least, weren't always sympathetic; as played by Lewis and McKee, however, both Soames and Irene roundly deserved to be drop-kicked off the white cliffs of Dover.The DVD collection for the 1967 version has a Special Features section that provides some fascinating footage of More, the Porters, Susan Hampshire, etc., being interviewed about their characters and rehearsing scenes. There are also some interesting vintage programs depicting the Forsyte craze that swept England in the late 1960s. In all, this is a brilliant DVD set, well worth having for anyone who loves vintage TV at its best.",5,Incomparably better than the remake.,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,2290,"['1967', 'BBC', 'version', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'may', 'have', 'primitive', 'even', 'laughable', 'production', 'values', 'compared', '2002', 'remake', 'other', 'way', 'original', 'version', 'superior', 'wide', 'margin', '1967', 'version', 'was', 'worldwide', 'craze', 'began', 'proud', 'tradition', 'British', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'gave', 'Claudius', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'so', 'many', 'others', '2002', 'version', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'have', 'strangled', 'genre', 'cradle', 'so', 'dull', 'doughy', 'little', 'much', 'grant', 'modern', 'audiences', 'see', 'stock', 'footage', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'funeral', 'General', 'Strike', 'etc.', 'interweaved', 'stagebound', 'black-and-white', 'scenes', 'actors', 'actors', 'most', 'whom', 'would', 'become', 'extremely', 'familiar', 'subsequent', 'miniseries', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'Producer', 'Donald', 'Wilson', 'team', 'writers', 'created', '26', 'episodes', 'stuffed', 'sparkling', 'dialogue', 'meticulously', 'detailed', 'plot', 'just', 'Galsworthy', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'performers', 'newer', 'version', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'came', 'close', 'matching', 'counterpart', 'original', 'was', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Jo', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'Graves', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'however', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'tap-danced', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'rugby', 'cleats', 'Porters', 'relation', 'other', 'marriage', 'blood', 'were', 'uniquely', 'magically', 'right', 'roles', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'close-ups', 'end', 'Episode', '6', 'course', 'crucial', 'plot', 'point', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'performers', 'history', 'television', 'actors', 'created', 'enormous', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'who', 'say', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'sympathetic', 'played', 'Lewis', 'McKee', 'however', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'roundly', 'deserved', 'be', 'drop-kicked', 'white', 'cliffs', 'Dover.The', 'DVD', 'collection', '1967', 'version', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'fascinating', 'footage', 'More', 'Porters', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'etc.', 'being', 'interviewed', 'characters', 'rehearsing', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'vintage', 'programs', 'depicting', 'Forsyte', 'craze', 'swept', 'England', 'late', '1960s', 'brilliant', 'DVD', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'anyone', 'who', 'vintage', 'TV', 'best']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

It covers three generations at the time when the West was undergoing the most substantial social and technological changes in its history.Irene commits cold-blooded marriage to escape a difficult personal situation.  She loathes the man she marries and comes to loathe him more and more even though he showers her with gifts and does his best by her.  After three years, she commits adultery with the fianc&eacute; of a cousin, wrecking her life.  When her husband finds out about it, his patience finally snaps and he forces her to have sex with him.  She immediately runs to her lover, sobbing and telling him what happened.  The news so unhinges him that he wanders the streets in a daze and is run over and killed.Irene then endures several years of lower-middle-class existence, then begins seeing one of the older men in the Forsyte family she has married into.  With her demur, pretty and unattainable sweetness, she so rouses him that he has a heart attack and dies.  This leads to an acquaintance with her son and their eventual marriage.Years later, when Irene's son falls in love with the daughter of her ex-husband, Irene does her hysterical, anguished dance once more, causing her husband to have a heart attack and die.  As a result, her son, against his own wishes and judgment, breaks off his engagement with the daughter of the ex-husband, condemning her to an unsatisfied life.Final score: four men dead, two women's lives ruined, and Irene alone remains standing, untouched, serene, and pretty as ever.This is a superb, 22-hour dramatization and will be cherished by everyone who likes period drama, tight screenwriting, accurate acting and a moving story.  A remake was done recently.  It has none of these qualities, and its London-hip actors wearing period clothes will appeal only to those unable to relate to any other period than their own.",5,a trail of destruction,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1997,"['Many', 'story', 'threads', 'are', 'woven', 'mammoth', 'drama', 'one', 'being', 'tale', 'woman', 'who', 'trail', 'destruction', 'wake', 'three', 'generations', 'time', 'when', 'West', 'was', 'undergoing', 'most', 'substantial', 'social', 'technological', 'changes', 'history.Irene', 'commits', 'cold-blooded', 'marriage', 'escape', 'difficult', 'personal', 'situation', 'man', 'loathe', 'more', 'more', 'even', 'gifts', 'best', 'three', 'years', 'adultery', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'cousin', 'wrecking', 'life', 'When', 'husband', 'out', 'patience', 'finally', 'snaps', 'have', 'sex', 'immediately', 'lover', 'sobbing', 'telling', 'what', 'happened', 'news', 'so', 'streets', 'daze', 'run', 'killed.Irene', 'then', 'several', 'years', 'lower-middle-class', 'existence', 'then', 'seeing', 'one', 'older', 'men', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'married', 'demur', 'pretty', 'unattainable', 'sweetness', 'so', 'heart', 'attack', 'dies', 'acquaintance', 'son', 'eventual', 'marriage.Years', 'later', 'when', 'Irene', 'son', 'love', 'daughter', 'ex-husband', 'Irene', 'hysterical', 'anguished', 'dance', 'once', 'more', 'causing', 'husband', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'die', 'result', 'son', 'own', 'wishes', 'judgment', 'breaks', 'off', 'engagement', 'daughter', 'ex-husband', 'condemning', 'unsatisfied', 'life.Final', 'score', 'four', 'men', 'dead', 'two', 'women', 'lives', 'ruined', 'Irene', 'alone', 'standing', 'untouched', 'serene', 'pretty', 'ever.This', 'superb', '22-hour', 'dramatization', 'will', 'be', 'cherished', 'everyone', 'who', 'period', 'drama', 'tight', 'screenwriting', 'accurate', 'acting', 'moving', 'story', 'remake', 'was', 'done', 'recently', 'none', 'qualities', 'London-hip', 'actors', 'wearing', 'period', 'clothes', 'will', 'appeal', 'only', 'unable', 'relate', 'other', 'period', 'own']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

723753,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00007149J,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","A labour of love for writer/producer Donald Wilson, the BBC's sprawling 1967 miniseries of THE FORSYTE SAGA is still the benchmark upon which all the great costume dramas must be measured against.  Based on the legendary series of novels by John Galsworthy (""The Man of Property"", ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"", ""In Chancery"", ""Awakening"" and ""To Let""), the story follows three generations of the Forsyte family, whose lives are all forever changed by incidents surrounding key figures Soames, Irene and Young Jolyon.The story begins in the late 1800's.  Trapped in a loveless marriage, watercolour painter Young Jolyon (Kenneth More) earns the ire of his family and must make his own fortune when he runs off with governess Helene Hilmer (Lana Morris).  This action forever splinters the Forsyte family and makes Young Jolyon even more of a ""black sheep"" than he was before.On the other side of the family, Young Jolyon's cousin Soames (Eric Porter), a successful London solicitor, is intent on marrying the lovely Irene Heron (Nyree Dawn Porter).  Nudged on by her unscrupulous stepmother and repulsed by the lecherous advances of her prospective new stepfather, Irene makes no secret that she doesn't love Soames, but eventually accepts his proposal, on the condition that, if the marriage doesn't succeed, he'll let her be free.  This promise will haunt the pair for the rest of their lives.  Several years pass, in which time Irene hasn't learned to love her domineering, martinet husband.  Instead, she has fallen into an affair with architect Philip Bosinney (John Bennett) - the fianc&eacute; of Young Jolyon's now-grown daughter June (June Barry).Soames' sister Winifred (Margaret Tyzack) stumbles along in a shambolic marriage to Montague ""Monty"" Dartie (Terence Alexander), an alcoholic womaniser and wastrel who (apart from two children) brings her nothing but grief.  Long-separated from Irene and yearning to get married and start a family with the lovely young Annette (Dalia Penn), Soames pushes Irene to a divorce, only to find that she has fallen into the sympathetic arms of Young Jolyon.Despite the deep feud surrounding Soames and Young Jolyon, the two sides of the Forsyte family stubbornly refuse to stay estranged, as evidenced when Young Jolyon's daughter Holly (Suzanne Neve) falls in love with Winifred's son Val (Jonathan Burn).  As the story moves into the 1920's, the spotlight shifts to the lives of Soames' now-grown daughter Fleur (Susan Hampshire), Irene's son Jon (Martin Jarvis) and their own stormy romance - made all the more painful and difficult in the wake of their parents' bitter past union.Donald Wilson fought passionately for many years to secure the rights to THE FORSYTE SAGA, still owned at the time by MGM (who had created a film from the first novel entitled ""That Forsyte Woman"" in the 1940's but hadn't touched the property since).  Notably, THE FORSYTE SAGA was one of the final BBC series taped in B&W; - Donald Wilson himself said he would have preferred the series in colour, but it must be said that the story does lend itself beautifully to the B&W; palette, especially in the Victorian/Edwardian portions (where, amongst other events, real footage of the death of Queen Victoria was able to be seamlessly incorporated into the drama).  The photography also provides a haunting, ethereal quality to many scenes.  Donald Wilson worked with a small coterie of writers (Anthony Steven, Lawrie Craig, Vincent Tilsley, Constance Cox and Lennox Phillips), who together managed to reign together Galsworthy's labyrinthine maze of plots into a steady series of 26 fifty-minute episodes.Picture and sound quality greatly varies in this DVD boxset but on the whole the quality is surprisingly good (although certain episodes look better than others).  The BBC took great care of the series and it appears that the original studio 'quad-tapes' were used in the remastering for this DVD collection.  There are several fascinating extras included on the last DVD, including some rare colour footage taken from the taping of the final episode; and some illuminating on-set interviews with Donald Wilson, costume supervisor Joan Ellacott and cast members Kenneth More, Nyree Dawn Porter, Eric Porter, Maggie Tyzack, Nicholas Pennell and Susan Hampshire.",5,a benchmark of TV drama - unmissable entertainment,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,4296,"['labour', 'love', 'writer/producer', 'Donald', 'Wilson', 'BBC', 'sprawling', '1967', 'miniseries', 'THE', 'FORSYTE', 'SAGA', 'still', 'benchmark', 'great', 'costume', 'dramas', 'must', 'be', 'measured', 'Based', 'legendary', 'series', 'novels', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'Man', 'Property', 'Indian', 'Summer', 'Forsyte', 'Chancery', 'Awakening', 'Let', 'story', 'three', 'generations', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'incidents', 'surrounding', 'key', 'figures', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'Young', 'Jolyon.The', 'story', 'late', '1800', 'Trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'watercolour', 'painter', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'ire', 'family', 'must', 'make', 'own', 'fortune', 'when', 'governess', 'Helene', 'Hilmer', 'Lana', 'Morris', 'action', 'forever', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'even', 'more', 'black', 'sheep', 'was', 'before.On', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'cousin', 'Soames', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'successful', 'London', 'solicitor', 'intent', 'marrying', 'lovely', 'Irene', 'Heron', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'Nudged', 'unscrupulous', 'stepmother', 'repulsed', 'lecherous', 'advances', 'prospective', 'new', 'stepfather', 'Irene', 'secret', ""n't"", 'love', 'Soames', 'eventually', 'proposal', 'condition', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'succeed', ""'ll"", 'let', 'be', 'free', 'promise', 'will', 'haunt', 'pair', 'rest', 'lives', 'Several', 'years', 'pass', 'time', 'Irene', ""n't"", 'learned', 'love', 'domineering', 'martinet', 'husband', 'Instead', 'fallen', 'affair', 'architect', 'Philip', 'Bosinney', 'John', 'Bennett', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'now-grown', 'daughter', 'June', 'June', 'Barry', 'sister', 'Winifred', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'along', 'shambolic', 'marriage', 'Montague', 'Monty', 'Dartie', 'Terence', 'Alexander', 'alcoholic', 'womaniser', 'wastrel', 'who', 'apart', 'two', 'children', 'nothing', 'grief', 'Long-separated', 'Irene', 'yearning', 'get', 'married', 'start', 'family', 'lovely', 'young', 'Annette', 'Dalia', 'Penn', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'divorce', 'only', 'find', 'fallen', 'sympathetic', 'arms', 'Young', 'Jolyon.Despite', 'deep', 'feud', 'surrounding', 'Soames', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'two', 'sides', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'stubbornly', 'refuse', 'stay', 'estranged', 'evidenced', 'when', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Suzanne', 'Neve', 'love', 'Winifred', 'son', 'Val', 'Jonathan', 'Burn', 'story', '1920', 'spotlight', 'shifts', 'lives', 'Soames', 'now-grown', 'daughter', 'Fleur', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Irene', 'son', 'Jon', 'Martin', 'Jarvis', 'own', 'stormy', 'romance', 'made', 'more', 'painful', 'difficult', 'wake', 'parents', 'bitter', 'union.Donald', 'Wilson', 'fought', 'passionately', 'many', 'years', 'secure', 'rights', 'THE', 'FORSYTE', 'SAGA', 'still', 'owned', 'time', 'MGM', 'who', 'had', 'created', 'film', 'first', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Forsyte', 'Woman', '1940', 'had', ""n't"", 'touched', 'property', 'Notably', 'THE', 'FORSYTE', 'SAGA', 'was', 'one', 'final', 'BBC', 'series', 'taped', 'B', 'W', 'Donald', 'Wilson', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'series', 'colour', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'lend', 'beautifully', 'B', 'W', 'palette', 'especially', 'Victorian/Edwardian', 'portions', 'where', 'other', 'events', 'real', 'footage', 'death', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'seamlessly', 'incorporated', 'drama', 'photography', 'also', 'haunting', 'ethereal', 'quality', 'many', 'scenes', 'Donald', 'Wilson', 'worked', 'small', 'coterie', 'writers', 'Anthony', 'Steven', 'Lawrie', 'Craig', 'Vincent', 'Tilsley', 'Constance', 'Cox', 'Lennox', 'Phillips', 'who', 'together', 'managed', 'reign', 'together', 'Galsworthy', 'labyrinthine', 'maze', 'plots', 'steady', 'series', '26', 'fifty-minute', 'episodes.Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'greatly', 'DVD', 'boxset', 'whole', 'quality', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'certain', 'episodes', 'look', 'better', 'others', 'BBC', 'took', 'great', 'care', 'series', 'original', 'studio', ""'quad-tapes"", 'were', 'used', 'remastering', 'DVD', 'collection', 'are', 'several', 'fascinating', 'extras', 'included', 'last', 'DVD', 'including', 'rare', 'colour', 'footage', 'taken', 'taping', 'final', 'episode', 'illuminating', 'on-set', 'interviews', 'Donald', 'Wilson', 'costume', 'supervisor', 'Joan', 'Ellacott', 'cast', 'members', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Maggie', 'Tyzack', 'Nicholas', 'Pennell', 'Susan', 'Hampshire']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

723758,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B00007149J,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[11, 11]","In the early years of the last century, John Galsworthy wrote nine novels, divided into three trilogies. &quot;The Man of Property,&quot; &quot;In Chancery&quot; and &quot;To Let&quot; formed the first trilogy, which he called &quot;The Forsyte Saga.&quot; The second group, &quot;The White Monkey,&quot; &quot;The Silver Swan&quot; and &quot;Swan Song&quot; formed &quot;A Modern Comedy.&quot; Finally &quot;Maid in Waiting,&quot; &quot;Flowering Wilderness&quot; and &quot;One More River&quot; made up the last group called &quot;End of the Chapter.&quot;The first three books concentrated on the property-driven first generation Forsyte men, whose world was broken up by a beautiful woman called Irene, &quot;a concretion of disturbing Beauty impinging on a possessive world,&quot; as Galsworthy puts it in his preface. But it is also a saga that brings us from the Victorian world in the 1880s up to the 1920s when the new generation finds new values.Now this is very difficult stuff to reduce to a miniseries, but that is what BBC did quite successfully back in the 1960s and the television audience on both sides of the Atlanic went wild. For half a year, given a 50-minute episode each week for 26 weeks, they sat fascinated as they watched the fortunes of the Forsytes, man and woman, grasping, losing, growing older, having children who suffered from what their parents had done, some finding happiness at last, some settling for second best, but all interesting and very human. It is said that the idea of British miniseries based on famous novels is what prompted PBS to create Masterpiece Theatre to satisfy the demand. (Coincidentally, at the time of this writing, the very first Masterpiece Theatre, &quot;The First Churchills,&quot; is due to come out on DVD from Acorn Media!)I am sure many of you have watched the first third of the new version of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; complete with color, the obligatory scenes in bed, and horse manure carefully piled up in the streets of London. Be advised that the 1967 version is a studio version, with several location shots, in glorious black and white, with a cast that is simply hard to beat or even match, and a tendency to be wonderfully addictive.I have viewed the DVD version on 7 discs released by Warner Home Video on the BBC label. (Yes, that is 1300 minutes in all, followed by 2 hours of spellbinding, often extremely funny,  &quot;bonus&quot; material on the 7th disc.) If you prefer video tapes, the series comes in two sets: The First Generation on 6 tapes, The Second Generation on 7 tapes. They do not contain any of the extra material, so be advised.Technically, the picture has been beautifully restored except for a second here and there when there is a slight blur, perhaps 10 seconds worth out of more than 21 hours hours, and now and then the sound does get a bit fuzzy. In fact, I remember that being true when this series was first telecast, so that is no fault of this restoration.The major stars are Eric Porter (Soames Forstye), Nyree Dawn Porter (Irene), Kenneth Moore (young Jolyon Forsyte), and a pretty actress who made her reputation in this series, Susan Hampshire. I cannot begin to list the rest, all of which you can catch during the end titles and much of which you can find on the Internet Movie Data Base. Porter plays to perfection the &quot;unlovable&quot; man who cannot understand why he is so; and as the story unfolds, his partial mellowing, as played by Porter, is an example to all &quot;modern&quot; actors.In the book, Irene is seen only through the consciousness of the other characters, and as good as Ms. Porter looks as Irene, her acting is a touch wooden for such a catalytic character. Still she looks far more striking than her counterpart in the 2002 version.Galsworthy has been compared with Thackery, but he does not quite have the sweep of that earlier author. Still, the scene at a party after a lawsuit in which the loser is attracting all the attention while the winners are being cold-shouldered by their so-called friends is both painful and telling. (In fact, if it makes you think of &quot;Chicago,&quot; you can see how far ahead Galsworthy was in his estimation of how we treat &quot;morality.&quot;)Of course this is high class soap opera, but the production values are quite good for a 1967 studio production, the acting superb, and the dialogue a bit more intelligent than you will find in the afternoon on commercial series. This set, on tapes or DVDs, is a real &quot;grabbit.&quot; It afforded me nearly 22 hours of viewing pleasure and will do the same for you.",5,We have waited too long for this one!,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,4602,"['early', 'years', 'last', 'century', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'wrote', 'nine', 'novels', 'divided', 'three', 'trilogies', 'quot', 'Man', 'Property', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chancery', 'quot', 'quot', 'Let', 'quot', 'formed', 'first', 'trilogy', 'called', 'quot', 'Forsyte', 'Saga.', 'quot', 'second', 'group', 'quot', 'White', 'Monkey', 'quot', 'quot', 'Silver', 'Swan', 'quot', 'quot', 'Swan', 'Song', 'quot', 'formed', 'quot', 'A', 'Modern', 'Comedy.', 'quot', 'Finally', 'quot', 'Maid', 'Waiting', 'quot', 'quot', 'Flowering', 'Wilderness', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'More', 'River', 'quot', 'made', 'up', 'last', 'group', 'called', 'quot', 'End', 'Chapter.', 'quot', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'concentrated', 'property-driven', 'first', 'generation', 'Forsyte', 'men', 'world', 'was', 'broken', 'up', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'called', 'Irene', 'quot', 'concretion', 'disturbing', 'Beauty', 'impinging', 'possessive', 'world', 'quot', 'Galsworthy', 'preface', 'also', 'saga', 'Victorian', 'world', '1880s', 'up', '1920s', 'when', 'new', 'generation', 'new', 'values.Now', 'very', 'difficult', 'stuff', 'reduce', 'miniseries', 'what', 'BBC', 'did', 'quite', 'successfully', 'back', '1960s', 'television', 'audience', 'sides', 'Atlanic', 'went', 'wild', 'year', 'given', '50-minute', 'episode', 'week', '26', 'weeks', 'sat', 'fascinated', 'watched', 'fortunes', 'Forsytes', 'man', 'woman', 'grasping', 'losing', 'growing', 'older', 'having', 'children', 'who', 'suffered', 'what', 'parents', 'had', 'done', 'finding', 'happiness', 'last', 'settling', 'second', 'best', 'interesting', 'very', 'human', 'said', 'idea', 'British', 'miniseries', 'based', 'famous', 'novels', 'what', 'prompted', 'PBS', 'create', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'satisfy', 'demand', 'Coincidentally', 'time', 'writing', 'very', 'first', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'quot', 'First', 'Churchills', 'quot', 'due', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'third', 'new', 'version', 'quot', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'quot', 'complete', 'color', 'obligatory', 'scenes', 'bed', 'horse', 'manure', 'carefully', 'piled', 'up', 'streets', 'London', 'Be', 'advised', '1967', 'version', 'studio', 'version', 'several', 'location', 'shots', 'glorious', 'black', 'white', 'cast', 'simply', 'hard', 'beat', 'even', 'match', 'tendency', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'addictive.I', 'have', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'version', '7', 'discs', 'released', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'BBC', 'label', 'Yes', '1300', 'minutes', 'followed', '2', 'hours', 'spellbinding', 'often', 'extremely', 'funny', 'quot', 'quot', 'material', '7th', 'disc', 'prefer', 'video', 'tapes', 'series', 'two', 'sets', 'First', 'Generation', '6', 'tapes', 'Second', 'Generation', '7', 'tapes', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'extra', 'material', 'so', 'be', 'advised.Technically', 'picture', 'been', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'second', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'slight', 'blur', 'perhaps', '10', 'seconds', 'worth', 'more', '21', 'hours', 'hours', 'now', 'then', 'sound', 'get', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'fact', 'remember', 'being', 'true', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'telecast', 'fault', 'restoration.The', 'major', 'stars', 'are', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Soames', 'Forstye', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'Irene', 'Kenneth', 'Moore', 'young', 'Jolyon', 'Forsyte', 'pretty', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'reputation', 'series', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'list', 'rest', 'can', 'catch', 'end', 'titles', 'much', 'can', 'find', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Data', 'Base', 'Porter', 'perfection', 'quot', 'unlovable', 'quot', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'story', 'unfolds', 'partial', 'mellowing', 'played', 'Porter', 'example', 'quot', 'modern', 'quot', 'book', 'Irene', 'seen', 'only', 'consciousness', 'other', 'characters', 'as', 'good', 'Ms.', 'Porter', 'Irene', 'acting', 'touch', 'wooden', 'catalytic', 'character', 'Still', 'far', 'more', 'striking', 'counterpart', '2002', 'version.Galsworthy', 'been', 'compared', 'Thackery', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'sweep', 'earlier', 'author', 'Still', 'scene', 'party', 'lawsuit', 'loser', 'attracting', 'attention', 'winners', 'are', 'being', 'cold-shouldered', 'so-called', 'friends', 'painful', 'telling', 'fact', 'think', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'ahead', 'Galsworthy', 'was', 'estimation', 'how', 'treat', 'quot', 'quot', 'course', 'high', 'class', 'soap', 'opera', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'good', '1967', 'studio', 'production', 'acting', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'more', 'intelligent', 'will', 'find', 'afternoon', 'commercial', 'series', 'set', 'tapes', 'DVDs', 'real', 'quot', 'quot', 'afforded', 'nearly', '22', 'hours', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'will', 'do', 'same']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

What we select, what we reject, what defined moments represent inner truth, which of these bubbles in time define and shape us. Being an artist with intense visual and verbal recall, it amused me to be surprised that this compelling series imprinted itself in my memories as if it had been broadcast in color, watching this as a child. Aside from that, this 1967 masterpiece is exactly as excellent as I remembered, even if Irene's hair is not butter-yellow, but a light within the back and white spectrum (the re-mastered picture resolution is sharp). One dark, difficult Montana winter, I immersed myself in Galsworthy's epic, written between 1906 and 1921. Art and what it means to be true to self are well explored, as in the ennui of the 20th century. The BBC casting of the 1967 mega-hit depicts the characters true to Galsworthy's vision. Nyree Dawn Porter was a softly curved and gentle, and exquisite foil to the perfection of Eric Porter as Soames Forsyte's obsession. He reminds me of the 18th century's Barnabas Collins, whose grim resurrection in the 1960s was a rage inDark Shadows: The Beginning, Collection 1-Dark Shadows Collection 26(shades of darkness lost in the camp vampness of the recent Burton remake). Given that Soames is the backbone, the structure of the Forsyte Saga, I couldn't abide his miscasting in the 2002 version. Eric Porter will always be the true Soames, the hard slate upon which all the other characters dance around. The specials on the last disk are an absolute treat, taking viewers back to England in the 60s, as people debate the Saga as if the Forsyte clan were members of their own family. Which, in a sense, they were. Churches and pubs were emptied across the U.K., as audiences were utterly mesmerized by the story of a family moving from humble country roots to wealthy, upper-class status. Soames, upon visiting the rural graves and home sites of his ancestors, wonders what the Forsyte family lost in this process of London-based prosperity. Contemporary viewers ofDownton Abbey, as well as those who remember this Saga fondly, will truly enjoy this classic.",5,Intimate Portrait Through Time,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,2194,"['Memory', 'quixotic', 'element', 'something', 'know', 'especially', 'older', 'get', 'What', 'select', 'what', 'reject', 'what', 'defined', 'moments', 'represent', 'inner', 'truth', 'bubbles', 'time', 'define', 'shape', 'Being', 'artist', 'intense', 'visual', 'verbal', 'recall', 'amused', 'be', 'surprised', 'compelling', 'series', 'imprinted', 'memories', 'had', 'been', 'broadcast', 'color', 'watching', 'child', 'Aside', '1967', 'masterpiece', 'exactly', 'as', 'excellent', 'remembered', 'even', 'Irene', 'hair', 'not', 'butter-yellow', 'light', 'back', 'white', 'spectrum', 're-mastered', 'picture', 'resolution', 'sharp', 'One', 'dark', 'difficult', 'Montana', 'winter', 'immersed', 'Galsworthy', 'epic', 'written', '1906', '1921', 'Art', 'what', 'be', 'true', 'self', 'are', 'well', 'explored', 'ennui', '20th', 'century', 'BBC', 'casting', '1967', 'mega-hit', 'characters', 'true', 'Galsworthy', 'vision', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'was', 'softly', 'curved', 'gentle', 'exquisite', 'foil', 'perfection', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'obsession', '18th', 'century', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'grim', 'resurrection', '1960s', 'was', 'rage', 'inDark', 'Shadows', 'Beginning', 'Collection', '1-Dark', 'Shadows', 'Collection', '26', 'shades', 'darkness', 'lost', 'camp', 'vampness', 'recent', 'Burton', 'remake', 'Given', 'Soames', 'backbone', 'structure', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'could', ""n't"", 'abide', 'miscasting', '2002', 'version', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'true', 'Soames', 'hard', 'slate', 'other', 'characters', 'dance', 'around', 'specials', 'last', 'disk', 'are', 'absolute', 'treat', 'taking', 'viewers', 'back', 'England', '60s', 'people', 'debate', 'Saga', 'Forsyte', 'clan', 'were', 'members', 'own', 'family', 'Which', 'sense', 'were', 'Churches', 'pubs', 'were', 'emptied', 'U.K.', 'audiences', 'were', 'utterly', 'mesmerized', 'story', 'family', 'moving', 'humble', 'country', 'roots', 'wealthy', 'upper-class', 'status', 'Soames', 'visiting', 'rural', 'graves', 'home', 'sites', 'ancestors', 'wonders', 'what', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'lost', 'process', 'London-based', 'prosperity', 'Contemporary', 'viewers', 'ofDownton', 'Abbey', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'remember', 'Saga', 'fondly', 'will', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'classic']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

In the honored tradition of BBC productions of the era, the sets are somewhat flimsy (walls shake when doors are slammed shut - you could make it a drinking game in some episodes). The costumes are well done but not entirely period correct - you know, the late 60s/early 70s hair along with a slight spin on the costumes (think more SF Opera one piece costumes rather than Dickens Faire period correct costumes). In early episodes - some of the actors seem to be rushing lines and it can be hard to pick up what they are saying - and there are no subtitles available for the hearing impaired.But the rewards are great - you see the development of complex characters, you see Soames as truly unlikable at first and then changing as he grows older and learns from his life. You also see some of the actors improving their acting skills - and you get a rich story that is very true to the original story written by John Galsworthy. It's far more complex and engaging than the 2002-2003 miniseries - with some fantastic double entendres that are just left out of the new series entirely (in favor of batting people over the head with overt sexuality).

I never saw the original Forsyte Saga until it was released on DVD, and I can now say confidently that it was well worth the wait.Since this is a production from the 1960s, all 26 episodes are black and white.  I expected this to make it seem somewhat old fashioned, but it wasn't at all.  The cast is so outstanding and the writing is so literate that one overlooks any thing which might seem a shortcoming. (For a rare example, I have to say that the Wilmots' ""Southern accents"" must rank among the worst ever perpetrated by non-Southerners!)  I had already seen the newer versions of The Forsyte Saga, so it was interesting to see and compare this depiction (generally this one is superior in acting and in scripting) with the later ones.

723769,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007149J,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","Having watched ""The Forsyte Saga: First Generation,"" the first half of the 26-episode British television series from 1967 after having enjoyed the 2002 production which covers the same part of the story.  So it seemed only fair that I reverse the pattern for the second half of the saga and watch the 1967 version of ""The Forsyte Saga: Second Generation"" before the advent of the new version later this year.  Having evidence a preference for the new over the old with the first half I will be interested in seeing if that continues to be the pattern or if I end up privileging the one I saw first.  I say that because I enjoyed the 1967 ""Second Generation"" more than the ""First Generation,"" and I am wondering if it was because this time around I did not know the story.The first part of the saga centered on the gravitation of Irene Forsyte n&eacute;e Heron (Nyree Dawn Porter) from a loveless marriage to Soames Forsyte (Eric Porter), a man of property, to his cousin Jo Forsyte (Kenneth More), the outcast artist of the family clan.  The Victorian age has come to an end and now the family conflict is passed on to a new generation, represented by Soames's daughter Fleur (Susan Hampshire) and Jon Forsyte (Martin Jarvis), son of Irene and Jo.  Unaware of the family feud the two youngsters meet and fall in love, but it is only a matter of time until the truth comes out and all hell breaks loose.  The other principle character is Michael Mont (Nicholas Pennell), who is fated to love Fleur more than she will ever love him.  However, even with his daughter taking the central part in the drama, the story keeps coming back to Soames and we wonder what when all is said and done is finally going to be the death blow for the old man.  When the end comes it is something of a surprising, but certainly a fitting climax.  As Michael says towards the end, ""It's pretty hard sometimes to remember that it is all comedy.""The soap opera elements, which include a case for libel, are balanced by a sense of the changing society, which moves beyond the Edwardian age to that of the post-World War I era.  Michael Mont becomes the spokesperson for the concerns of the times, probably because he is not a Forsyte, and in that regard he becomes the counterpart of Young Jo for the second-generation characters.  But in the end it is Soames who defines his family, both its strengths and weaknesses, and the second half of the saga resonates with our memory of how the first half ended.  Soames Forsyte was a man of property, but the term was clearly one of evolving meaning.  Ultimately, this production is one of those marvelous marriages of actors and characters, graced with a script that does a superb job of adapting a series of novels and two short stories by John Galsworthy that is rather sparse on actual dialogue in the initial works (this second half is essentially the 1921 novel ""To Let"").  Even in black & white it remains something to be equaled, but not surprassed.If possible you should catch the landmark 1967 television series on DVD mainly for the enjoyment of the additional material.  Surprisingly you will find a couple of deleted scenes and a whole series of outtakes; the latter are not of the comic variety, but more a collection of the technical problems reflecting state of the art television production at the time (it took 15 minutes to splice together two bits of video tape so they went to great lengths to avoid having to do so).  Even more fascinating are the public debates over the mini-series, including a very passionate debate over the issue of who was the injured party in the Soames-Irene question and the infamous scene in which he ""reasserted his marital rights.""  Any illusion you had of ""The Forsyte Saga"" being high brow (i.e., ""Masterpiece Theater"") is quickly dispelled as ordinary folk in the street reduce the entire affair to something on the level of ""All My Children"" but with the obsession of the level of ""Who Shot J.R.?""",5,"The saga of Soames Forsyte, man of property, comes to an end",1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,3971,"['Having', 'watched', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'First', 'Generation', 'first', 'half', '26-episode', 'British', 'television', 'series', '1967', 'having', 'enjoyed', '2002', 'production', 'same', 'part', 'story', 'seemed', 'only', 'fair', 'reverse', 'pattern', 'second', 'half', 'saga', 'watch', '1967', 'version', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'Second', 'Generation', 'advent', 'new', 'version', 'later', 'year', 'Having', 'evidence', 'preference', 'new', 'old', 'first', 'half', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'be', 'pattern', 'end', 'up', 'privileging', 'one', 'saw', 'first', 'say', 'enjoyed', '1967', 'Second', 'Generation', 'more', 'First', 'Generation', 'am', 'wondering', 'was', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'story.The', 'first', 'part', 'saga', 'centered', 'gravitation', 'Irene', 'Forsyte', 'n', 'eacute', 'Heron', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'man', 'property', 'cousin', 'Jo', 'Forsyte', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'outcast', 'artist', 'family', 'clan', 'Victorian', 'age', 'come', 'end', 'now', 'family', 'conflict', 'passed', 'new', 'generation', 'represented', 'Soames', 'daughter', 'Fleur', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Jon', 'Forsyte', 'Martin', 'Jarvis', 'son', 'Irene', 'Jo', 'Unaware', 'family', 'two', 'youngsters', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'truth', 'out', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'other', 'principle', 'character', 'Michael', 'Mont', 'Nicholas', 'Pennell', 'who', 'fated', 'love', 'Fleur', 'more', 'will', 'ever', 'love', 'However', 'even', 'daughter', 'taking', 'central', 'part', 'drama', 'story', 'coming', 'back', 'Soames', 'wonder', 'what', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'death', 'blow', 'old', 'man', 'When', 'end', 'something', 'surprising', 'certainly', 'fitting', 'climax', 'Michael', 'end', 'pretty', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'remember', 'comedy', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'include', 'case', 'libel', 'are', 'balanced', 'sense', 'changing', 'society', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'post-World', 'War', 'era', 'Michael', 'Mont', 'spokesperson', 'concerns', 'times', 'probably', 'not', 'Forsyte', 'regard', 'counterpart', 'Young', 'Jo', 'second-generation', 'characters', 'end', 'Soames', 'who', 'family', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'second', 'half', 'saga', 'memory', 'how', 'first', 'half', 'ended', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'was', 'man', 'property', 'term', 'was', 'clearly', 'one', 'evolving', 'meaning', 'Ultimately', 'production', 'one', 'marvelous', 'marriages', 'actors', 'characters', 'graced', 'script', 'superb', 'job', 'adapting', 'series', 'novels', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'rather', 'sparse', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'initial', 'works', 'second', 'half', 'essentially', '1921', 'novel', 'Let', 'Even', 'black', 'white', 'something', 'be', 'equaled', 'not', 'surprassed.If', 'possible', 'should', 'catch', 'landmark', '1967', 'television', 'series', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'enjoyment', 'additional', 'material', 'Surprisingly', 'will', 'find', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'whole', 'series', 'outtakes', 'latter', 'are', 'not', 'comic', 'variety', 'more', 'collection', 'technical', 'problems', 'reflecting', 'state', 'art', 'television', 'production', 'time', 'took', '15', 'minutes', 'splice', 'together', 'two', 'bits', 'video', 'tape', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'avoid', 'having', 'do', 'so', 'Even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'are', 'public', 'mini-series', 'including', 'very', 'passionate', 'debate', 'issue', 'who', 'was', 'injured', 'party', 'Soames-Irene', 'question', 'infamous', 'scene', 'reasserted', 'marital', 'rights', 'illusion', 'had', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'being', 'high', 'brow', 'i.e.', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'quickly', 'dispelled', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'street', 'reduce', 'entire', 'affair', 'something', 'level', 'My', 'Children', 'obsession', 'level', 'Who', 'Shot', 'J.R.']","Forsyte Saga, The: CSR (DVD)"

Watching it is one of the most delightful experiences as the BBC has done a great job in capturing Galsworthy's unforgettable characters.  Soames, Fleur, Irene, all the Jolyons, the aunts, uncles and their associated friends and enemies.There have been two other attempts to bring Galsworthy to either movies or TV. The first was MGMs ""That Forsyte Woman"" which omits to mention that Soames (horribly cast Errol Flynn) raped Irene there in setting things into motion. There is also the more modern version shown on Masterpiece Theatre.  While this probably was more explicit than the 1950s theatrical version, it suffered from excess of production values.  The Forsytes seemed rather richer than the royal family and there seemed to be more of an excess of marble and gilt than the parsimonious Forsytes would have approved of.In this version from the 1960s, it is as it should be and I think the fact that it is in black and white takes nothing away from the outstanding performances, most notably by Kenneth Moore, Eric Porter and the always wonderful Susan Hampshire (is there any other actress who could possibly do justice to Fleur?).This version is wonderful for other reasons, most notably the special features which capture just what a ground breaking series Forsyte Saga was when it first came out.

It was as wonderful as I remembered it being, even though it is in black and white, obviously filmed for the most part on a sound stage, and, yes, most of the actors are older than the characters they portray. But what a cast! The wonderful Eric Porter makes Soames the rich character that Galsworthy called The Man of Property. That Soames truly loves Irene but cannot help treating her as a possession shows clearly on Porter's face and in his mannerisms. His reaction when Irene tells him she loaths him is difficult to watch -- you truly ""feel his pain,"" as disbelief changes to shock and bewilderment. The lovely Nyree Dawn Porter is the perfect Irene, and younger than the sadly miscast actress who portrays the same character in the new version. This Irene is full of repressed emotions under a placid surface -- she is the spokeswoman for Galsworthy's belief that people should not be married unless there is a spark, an irresistable attraction that draws them together, which is totally lacking in her feelings for Soames. Kenneth Moore is a more than adequate Young Joloyn, although he was a little too old for the role at age 53. The rest of the cast is equally wonderful, especially the elderly character actors and actresses who portray the aunts and uncles -- they are as vital and interesting in this version as in the books, not afterthoughts, as they are in the 2002 adaptation. Unlike the new version, the script stays close to the original -- no gratuitous modern sexual innuendos from the female characters, for instance, which seemed to me to be an attempt to pander to a younger audience. Yes, I agree that the new version is inhanced by color, grander sets, and better makeup...the actresses in The Complete Series do make one wonder if there were any eyeliner and false eyelashes left in all of England by the time the series was completed!

Superb acting and character development abound, and it is difficult to say which was the more moving--Part I, set in the Victorian era, or Part II, which takes place in the 1920s. The narrative follows the lives of various members of an upper-middle-class British family, seeing them from their sedate, late nineteenth century affluence into an even more influential position in society, when Fleur, the daughter of Soames Forstye, marries into the aristocracy. Part I is narrated by ""Young Jolyon"" (wonderfully played by Kenneth More), the artistic black sheep of the Forsyte Family. Part II's narrator is Michael Mont, the buoyant, likeable young baronet with a social conscience, who becomes Fleur Forsyte's husband.Eric Porter does a splendid job in his portrayal of Soames Forsyte, whom we first encounter as a coldly materialistic, possessive man obsessed with wealth, propriety, and his lovely wife Irene. For all of his chilly acquisitiveness, Soames does harbor a love of beauty in his innermost soul, and his wife's lack of affection for him is the one blight on his otherwise successful life. Irene, played by Nyree Dawn Porter, represents the ""eternal feminine,"" the muse, the corporeal and spiritual beauty for which so many seek, but few people find. The men who worship her--Soames, the young architect Philip Bosinney, Young Jolyon, and even Young Jolyon's elderly father--do so as much for her indescribable charm and  mysterious allure as for her physical appeal. By the end of Part I, Irene has abandoned her role as Soames' trophy wife and, after one tragic love affair, finds happiness with the middle-aged, widowed ""Young Jolyon.""The series then takes us into the lives of Soames' daughter by his second marriage, the restless, willful Fleur (winsomely played by Susan Hampshire), and the innocent, idealistic Jon, Irene's son by Young Jolyon. Soames, who remains a major character, is still tied to his notions of property and propriety, but age and fatherhood have mellowed him, and he is a far more likeable individual than he was in the earlier episodes. The end of Part II witnesses the consummation of Fleur and Jon's forbidden love--kept apart by the old story of Soames' and Irene's unhappy marriage, Fleur has married Michael Mont and John has married Anne Wilmot, a pretty American girl. By this time, Soames has evolved into, perhaps, the most sympathetic character in the story, and we have come to feel affection for him, and a grudging respect.Filmed in black and white and originally broadcast in the 1960s, this remarkable made-for-television drama is still riveting, and a truly fine, accurate adaptation of John Galsworthy's Forsyte novels.

723778,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00007149J,Russell Fanelli,"[35, 36]","Many reviewers have amply praised this landmark series and noted quite rightly that it is far superior to the new version recently shown on PBS.  What I found most memorable about The Forsyte Saga was Soames Forysyte, The Man of Property.  We begin with Soames, wonderfully played by Eric Porter, as a young man in search of a wife and the series ends with him being cared for by his daughter Fleur, the excellent Susan Hampshire.Soames is villified and reproached by everyone because he is a tight fisted, hard, unyielding man who judges everything by its monetary value.  He wants a wife in order to get for himself an heir to his considerable property.  Love is not part of the equation for Soames.  An obedient, thrifty, proper woman will serve him well.  Unfortunatley for him, he falls in love with the beautiful Irene Herron, well played, for the most part, by Nyree Dawn Porter.  Irene is a young pianist who needs to find a home for herself.  She does not love Soames and tells him so, but this does not matter to Soames.  He will acquire her as he does a beautiful painting and hope that in time she will at least develop some affection for him.At first Irene tolerates Soames, but soon she comes to despise him because his soul is a mercantile product housed in a cash box for a body.  Soames finds it unbelievable that his new wife does not value security and wealth.  This is bad, but worse comes when she falls in love with the architect Soames commissions to build a house for her.  The architect dies in a tragic accident and Irene leaves Soames to live on her own,  if not in poverty, in seriously straightened circumstances.This conflict of Soames and Irene is at the heart of the entire series.  All of the Forsyte clan, and there are many members of this Victorian family, are touched in some way or another by the marriage and later divorce of Soames and Irene.  The greatness of this series is that we are able to follow the ongoing dispute as both Soames and Irene grow old.  Irene remains true to her artistic vision of herself, but Soames mellows somewhat because of his genuine love for his daughter.  In the end we come to have some modest respect and understanding for the old man. He is as much a 21st Century American Man of Property as a Victorian gentleman.For those viewers who fall in love with this series, I can recommend even more highly the books on which they are based by John Galsworthy.  The Man of Property starts the series of well written, wonderfully entertaining novels.

The series is a period-piece drama that follows the lives the upper-middle-class Forsyte family in England during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The characters are diverse, complex, and realistic.The series was shot in black & white and was initially shown in 26 episodes of 50 minutes each in 1967. The series starred stared Eric Porter as Soames, Kenneth More as Young Jolyon and Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene, (the always lovely and amazing) Susan Hampshire as Fleur, and Margaret Tyzack as Winifred. The series is more like a filmed stage play, so do not expect the flash and dazzle of a modern action-adventure movie.I have also seen the newer Forsyte Saga miniseries from 2002 (Forsyte Saga Collection).

Why those who choose to write scripts from famous works that many people know of by heart, then alter story line and characterizations is a puzzle to me.Fortunately, the the original version did not suffer from this, but instead respected Galsworthy's original works, as attested to by the books many of us have read.The key to the story of the Forsyte Saga is Irene Heron, played so memorably by New Zealand born actress Nyree Dawn Porter.Irene is an an artist, trapped in a life with a mother of questionable morals and little money to support herself.She agrees to marry the stolid Soames Forsyte after his persistent attention to her.Soames is a partner in the family law firm and cannot understand Irene's different temperament and ideals.He buys paintings as investments, she abhors his mercenary manner, as she could sit and look at a painting in a gallery for hours on end, glorifying, immersed in it's poignancy and beauty.But it's Irene, beautiful, strong, idealistic, who is the woman that is the object of obsessive love from her husband Soames who as the Man of Property, regards his wife as his own property, bought and paid for.Then architect Phillip Bosinney, hired by Soames to design and build a house in the country (Robin Hill) meets and falls inlove with Soames wife, recognising in Irene a like mind, a soul mate.Tragically Bosinney is killed in the London fog, and Irene leaves Soames to live in France.Later when in England, Irene decides to see Robin Hill and it is there that she meets old Jolyon Forsyte who is the owner of this beautiful house.Like Soames and Bosinney before him, the old gentleman is bewitched by Irene's beauty,and kindness, leaving her a substantial sum of money in his will to ensure she need never have to suffer deprivation again.His son Young Jolyon - an alias referred to by the aging Forsytes as ""the black sheep"" - meets Irene in Paris to give her the first payment as stipulated in Old Jolyon's will, and an attraction is obvious.I outline these matters to illustrate how central a figure the character of Irene is to this Saga, and how it all becomes believable because of the fine portrayal of Irene by Nyree Dawn Porter.Eric Porter as Soames was magnificent, the stiff formality of his generation, the longing to be loved, the inability to understand his free spirit of a wife, the grief at losing her,the unforgettable rape scene,the aging of his character Soames, his great love for his daughter Fleur, (brought wonderfully and realistically to life by Susan Hampshire) even his final moment when he sacrifices his life for his wayward daughter, is all depicted magnificently by Eric Porter.And finally to my personal favourite, the great Kenneth Moore who gave Young Jolyon the compassion and wisdom he so needed as he navigated his way through a disastrous first marriage, estrangement from Old Jolyon and his daughter June, the scandal when he marries his children's governess, and finally when he falls inlove with Soames estranged wife, Irene.It is Moore's voice used in the narration, which is done to great effect.The series was - in line with the sixties - made in black and white. The sets are a little on the crude side (doors that stick,poor lighting in some scenes, and a butler who acts in the mode of a cardboard cutout !)But for all this, the Forsyte Saga shines. It was the first big tele-series period/drama, and it was a benchmark for all the great series that followed it. It's a privelege to (finally) have it in my safe keeping on DVD.

The actors start out overage for their roles (Young Jolyon is referred to as being 32 and the actor Kenneth More was clearly decades older than that, ditto Eric Porter as Soames) but that is quickly forgotten beause of the fine acting. The black-and-white format probably serves the series well, because it was clearly filmed on a budget with small sets, and if in color would have looked more to be on the cheap. We are not distracted by the costumes and sets and even dated makeup, we just have to watch the story. Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene is excellent, you can believe in her transformation from naive and desperate girl facing poverty to, just a few years later, a suffocated and hardened, unhappy wife. In many ways this series is superior to the remake of 2002--Soames is more unrelentingly grim and clueless, as he should be. This older version is absolutely faithful to the plot in the novels.
