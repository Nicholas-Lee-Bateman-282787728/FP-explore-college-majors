1150545,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B0015QT77U,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[1, 1]","""Frank's Place"" aired for just one season in 1987.  I remember this series so clearly, even after so many years. It was, simply, one of the best I've ever seen. Fresh and funny, the cast was exceptional, and dialogue real.  The premise was not unusual--the perennial fish-out-of-water. This time it was Reid, a Boston professor who inherits The Chez (say the z), a small restaurant in New Orleans. I can't believe I still remember the name of the place...particularly after having just watched the entire ten billion episodes of breaking bad and could not tell you one character's name. Circumstances (and a voodoo curse) are such that he's pretty much obligated to stay and learn how to live in the South, run a restaurant, and figure out a culture that is possibly more alien to a New York or Boston black man than that of a foreign country.The cast was not the usual sitcom pretty faces and included a lot of talented and underutilized actors...notably Robert Harper (who had the wonderful name of Bubba Weinberger) and Daphne Reid as the love interest.  The producers used locals, including Don Yesso, who had never acted before, in several key roles.  Yesso played a character named Shorty, the lone white restaurant employee. His accent sounded more Brooklyn than Nawleans, but it was accurate.  That magnolia drawl most actors assay to play French Quarter types is strictly Actor's Studio.  Yesso went on to play Stanley Kowalski opposite Jessica Lange as Blanche DuBois in a 1992 Broadway revival of ""Streetcar Named Desire.""  Only three other actors have ever tackled the role on Broadway: Marlon Brando, Alec Baldwin and Jack Palance.  I think I'd prefer Yesso to those last two by a long shot.The humor at ""Frank's Place"" was broad on occasion, satirical on others, but never expected. And there was an interesting undercurrent of racial tension...it was presented in new ways and not always inter-racial. I remember one episode about a club for blacks that would only admit members who could pass the paper bag test.  I didn't know about this before the show, but some black people are very biased against dark skin tones. Anything 'lighter than a paper bag' is the acceptable shade. This was the unspoken requirement for the organization Frank wished to join. Lots of interesting little tidbits like that made the show unlike most other sitcoms, then or now.After just that one season, the show disappeared with no fanfare, no outcry.  Tim Reid has worked since them, fairly regularly, but nothing he has done has come close to this. He played a disc jockey on a dreadful show that, unaccountably became a huge success: WKRP in Cincinnati. The show is most notable for introducing (inflicting?) Loni Anderson on the population.Most recently, Reid plays another New Orleans character, a judge in the excellent ""Treme,"" a show that feels like a direct descendent of this original piece of work. This new cable show is set in post-Katerina NO. Its music, issues, and humor are all a little reminiscent of what we saw on ""Frank's Place.""  The difference is, ""Treme"" has a tremendous budget and this series was done on a shoestring. Amazing what sheer talent can do.  But no one wanted to watch, being glued the screen by ""Who's The Boss,"" I guess. Was it P.T. Barnum who said nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public?  From the reviews here, there was a handful of people who could tell the difference between comedy and a laugh track and they still miss the show a quarter of a century later.  I am eager to see this little slice of TV history again...maybe it will be available on DVD.  I hope so.",5,Ahead of its time...,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,3639,"['Frank', 'Place', 'aired', 'just', 'one', 'season', '1987', 'remember', 'series', 'so', 'clearly', 'even', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'simply', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Fresh', 'funny', 'cast', 'was', 'exceptional', 'dialogue', 'real', 'premise', 'was', 'not', 'unusual', 'perennial', 'fish-out-of-water', 'time', 'was', 'Reid', 'Boston', 'professor', 'who', 'Chez', 'say', 'z', 'small', 'restaurant', 'New', 'Orleans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'still', 'remember', 'name', 'place', 'particularly', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'entire', 'ten', 'billion', 'episodes', 'breaking', 'bad', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'one', 'character', 'name', 'Circumstances', 'voodoo', 'curse', 'are', 'such', 'pretty', 'much', 'obligated', 'stay', 'learn', 'how', 'live', 'South', 'run', 'restaurant', 'figure', 'out', 'culture', 'possibly', 'more', 'alien', 'New', 'York', 'Boston', 'black', 'man', 'foreign', 'country.The', 'cast', 'was', 'not', 'usual', 'sitcom', 'pretty', 'included', 'lot', 'talented', 'underutilized', 'actors', 'notably', 'Robert', 'Harper', 'who', 'had', 'wonderful', 'name', 'Bubba', 'Weinberger', 'Daphne', 'Reid', 'love', 'interest', 'producers', 'used', 'locals', 'including', 'Don', 'Yesso', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'before', 'several', 'key', 'roles', 'Yesso', 'played', 'character', 'named', 'Shorty', 'lone', 'white', 'restaurant', 'employee', 'accent', 'sounded', 'more', 'Brooklyn', 'Nawleans', 'was', 'accurate', 'magnolia', 'most', 'actors', 'assay', 'play', 'French', 'Quarter', 'types', 'strictly', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'Yesso', 'went', 'play', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'opposite', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Blanche', 'DuBois', '1992', 'Broadway', 'revival', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Only', 'three', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'tackled', 'role', 'Broadway', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'think', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'Yesso', 'last', 'two', 'long', 'shot.The', 'humor', 'Frank', 'Place', 'was', 'broad', 'occasion', 'satirical', 'others', 'never', 'expected', 'was', 'interesting', 'undercurrent', 'racial', 'tension', 'was', 'presented', 'new', 'ways', 'not', 'always', 'inter-racial', 'remember', 'one', 'episode', 'club', 'blacks', 'would', 'only', 'admit', 'members', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'paper', 'bag', 'test', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'biased', 'dark', 'skin', 'tones', 'Anything', ""'lighter"", 'paper', 'bag', 'acceptable', 'shade', 'was', 'unspoken', 'requirement', 'organization', 'Frank', 'wished', 'join', 'Lots', 'interesting', 'little', 'tidbits', 'made', 'show', 'most', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'then', 'now.After', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'show', 'disappeared', 'fanfare', 'outcry', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'worked', 'fairly', 'regularly', 'nothing', 'done', 'come', 'close', 'played', 'disc', 'jockey', 'dreadful', 'show', 'unaccountably', 'became', 'huge', 'success', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'show', 'most', 'notable', 'introducing', 'inflicting', 'Loni', 'Anderson', 'population.Most', 'recently', 'Reid', 'New', 'Orleans', 'character', 'judge', 'excellent', 'Treme', 'show', 'direct', 'descendent', 'original', 'piece', 'work', 'new', 'cable', 'show', 'set', 'post-Katerina', 'NO', 'music', 'issues', 'humor', 'are', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'what', 'saw', 'Frank', 'Place', 'difference', 'Treme', 'tremendous', 'budget', 'series', 'was', 'done', 'shoestring', 'Amazing', 'what', 'sheer', 'talent', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'wanted', 'watch', 'being', 'glued', 'screen', 'Who', 'Boss', 'guess', 'Was', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'who', 'said', 'nobody', 'ever', 'went', 'broke', 'underestimating', 'taste', 'American', 'public', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'handful', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'difference', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'track', 'still', 'miss', 'show', 'quarter', 'century', 'later', 'am', 'eager', 'see', 'little', 'slice', 'TV', 'history', 'again', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'hope', 'so']",Frank's Place
