Unfortunately, the movie decided to pull a Spielberg.Why is that important you ask? That's because the original work had great concepts, and this film just wasted them. I thought I was watching a cheesy version of Mortal Kombat (and I thought Mortal Kombat was a bit on the corny side to begin with). All the great characters who I enjoyed watching from the anime were twisted into plain and boring meatbags that gushes blood. I thought a live-action film would be more mature than a cartoon; boy, was I wrong.So, yeah, this movie pretty much sucked. It's filled with mediocre acting, cheesy special effects, bad makeup, horrific costumes (I thought it was suppose to be Feudal Japan, not the land of make-believe), and worst of all, the murdering of a great concept.Folks, go buy the anime series instead.

1017674,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B000HXDWOG,Anticlimacus,"[11, 18]","I waited for months to see Shinobi, which looked like an entertaining movie. Wasn't I surprised after I watched the film and realized how much it sucked. It's basically an action/romance film that fails miserably at establishing both action and romance.The romantic relationship was poorly developed. I was willing to look past this if the characters actually made decisions that were consistent with their undying devotion to one another. They don't. When our married couple are assigned to fight to the death (in a 5-on-5 fight), the husband temporarily disengages combat to investigate the reasons behind this royal command. What does the wife do? Promptly RE-ENGAGES COMBAT by ambushing the husband's 5-man team! How romantic. At that point I just wanted her to die a horrible death for betraying the very concept of love. You wench!By far the most disappointing aspect of Shinobi are the action sequences. I was expecting something akin to the post-2000 Chinese wuxia films or perhaps Azumi, not the crappy CGI-filled garbage that made The Promise, Storm Riders, and A Man Called Hero a total waste of time. Shinobi uses CGI tomfoolery in an effort to take the lazy way out, thus bypassing the need to map out innovative and exciting fighting moves. Not good.It is important to note that all 10 of our characters are supposedly superhuman, so they should have some cool moves. They don't. In fact, their special abilities are beyond idiotic. One girl can stare people to death. Wow. How many great action scenes are possible with that talent? Um, let's see . . . oh yeah - NONE! Another girl kills by showing off her sexy legs and kissing guys to death. Another girl simply acts the human shield by jumping in front of the lead female protagonist on numerous occasions. One of the guys can take the face of a dead person. Whoever thought of these ""special abilities"" obviously had no foresight into the destructive ramifications that would befall the action scenes, almost ALL of which end in ONE simple move - i.e., a kiss, a stare, a single swing of a sword, etc. Basically, a character will be strolling along in the lush woodlands of Japan, then you'll hear a slicing sound, then the character falls over. In the entire 100-minute running time, the only halfway decent action scene is the slow-mo multiple ninja fight with the lead protagonist, which lasts less than 2 minutes.In addition, not all action scenes need to be long and complexly choreographed. If there is sufficient storyline and character development, a short - yet intense - fight can be very effective (see Kill Zone). However, badly choreographed action in context with bad or non-existent storyline or character development is a poor combination. Shinobi indulges in this bitter recipe far too often.Here's an example of the fighting ineptitude present in Shinobi. The grand finale has our two lovebirds fight to the death. The entire scene consists of the following: the wife runs at the husband and stabs him in the chest. That's it! And considering the utter lack of character development, I was ready to throw my computer out my front window after witnessing that debacle.Even more upsetting than the crappiness of this film are the comments on IMDb. One positive reviewer went so far as to say that Shinobi is ""far superior to Azumi and Azumi 2 in all aspects."" This person should be forced to lick the pond scum off of the underbelly of a garbage boat for the rest of their natural life. The statement is basically analogous to someone saying that a McDonald's hamburger is ""far superior"" to a filet mignon. Only a certifiable lunatic could possibly hold that opinion.Take an example. Shinobi and (the much maligned) Azumi 2 have a similar character who wears furry camouflage and has blades for weapons. The difference is that Azumi 2 contributes an excellent fight in a bamboo forest while also incorporating poison-laced razor-sharp wires. Shinobi kills the character with - yet again - a deadly kiss. I know that opinion is subjective, but anyone who seriously claims that Shinobi's use of that character was better than that of Azumi 2 should be committed to a mental health facility.By now the viewer should have noted how much I despise the utter piece of crap-infested garbage that calls itself Shinobi. It's essentially equivalent to The Promise, only with Japanese actors and less CGI. The only thing that saves this film from a 1/10 is the cinematography and acting. And if anyone else has the utter lack of taste to claim that Shinobi is better than Azumi, I will personally hire that cute little assassin to slice you apart.

There was barely any lead or background into the battle scenes - just a brief exchange between the two lovers and then off to war. During the battle scenes, I found myself often confused as to what was going on as there were so many references to ancient feuds and warriors seem to come from nowhere to start another battle.Overall, this seems like this movie requires you to have a lot of background knowledge on Shinobi and the mythology around it to really appreciate this movie.

1017680,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000HXDWOG,Ernest Jagger,"[10, 13]","""Shinobi-Heart Under Blade,"" is a fun and entertaining film. Suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film; and if you have viewed Azumi 1 & 2, or Takeshi Kitano's film ""The Blindswordman Zatoichi,"" then you will enjoy this film. I was given this film by a friend as a Christmas present, and just recently viewed it; and I must write that I found it highly enjoyable. There is CGI in the film, but it did not bother me, considering the abilities of the various ninja's depicted in the film would more or less require its use. Also, the story itself is based from Japanese manga, called ""Basilisk."" And although I have not had a chance to look at these, I might someday. Just thought that I would pass this along.The film is set in 17th-century Japan. In the film there are two Shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years. The two tribes are called the IGA and the KOUGA. They have been forced to obey a decree by the Shogun who has unified Japan, and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting. Two of the ninja's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love: They are Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri) however, both must keep it a secret. The Shogun however, sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him, and decides that a tournament be held. Five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death. These different ninja characters are extremely colorful. Each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting. As I wrote in the beginning, this is not an Akira Kurosawa type film, such as ""Seven Samurai,"" therefore, suspension of disbelief is necessary.Moreover, you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a Kurosawa film: so what! the film is a fun watch anyway. I would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film, however, I can live with this, as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy. However, the acting in the film is very good. Since the film comes from comic and anime origins, the characters do not disappoint the viewer. The film seems a bit comic-book at times, but that is one of the reasons I think I enjoyed the film so much more. And besides, the visuals I believe were done incredibly great. Also, while not like your typical Japanese film, in terms of swordplay, the film is still enjoyable: remember this does derive from Manga.In the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight: the winners will serve the Shogunate, the loser will be vanquished. All of the fights take place while enroute to the capital, while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind. (Jo Odagiri) and (Yukie Nakama) give good acting performances in the film, which in turn makes this a better film. Once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'Romeo and Juliet,' to some degree. Once again, this is an enjoyable Japanese film, not to be taken seriously, or on par with some of the great Samurai epics of the past, just an enjoyably entertaining film. Also, I thought some of the characters' powers were very interesting, as it departs so much from much of Japanese cinema, in contrast to Chinese cinema, where this is so prevalent. All in all, a delightful and fun film. Enjoy it, and don't take it too seriously.

1017681,A1XWQ13VJDOQ7C,B000HXDWOG,"eternal now ""roejoerrer""","[1, 1]","Take the story of Romeo and Juliet, mix in elements of The X-Men and Ninja fantasy and you get 'Shinobi - Heart Under Blade'. Two ninja clans, the Koga and the Iga are long time enemies who have formed a truce. The heirs to the leadership of both clans fall in love, but since this movie is similar to Romeo and Juliet you can guess that a tragic fate awaits them. The shogun, who sees both clans as a threat devises a plot to get rid of them by pitting both clans against each other. What follows is a rather enchanting story that is marred by the occasional shoddy CGI effects and some truly questionable acting.Don't get me wrong, 'Shinobi' is a great film with some truly awesome cinematography and some great action scenes; it truly feels like a live action Anime. Sadly though, dialogue delivery feels rather forced at times, and rarely authentic and some of the charaters in the film exhibit rather cheesy qualities. Couple that with the most predictable of story lines and you get a decent film that could have been something amazing. The majority of the characters seem almost like cardboard cut outs; the script makes no motions to flesh out their back stories or motivations. Though the intentions of both clans are never really explored, the clans are polarized with one seemingly 'good' and the other seemingly 'evil', though it is never really told why this is. I could totally be missing the mark, but these were my observations.It may sound like I didn't enjoy the film, but as you can see by the star rating I gave I did enjoy it a lot. Despite all its flaws 'Shinobi' is an entertaining film with some stunning visuals. One of the things that hurts this film the most is that it tries to be both a romance and an action film, and sadly the romance portion gets somewhat lost in the fray. The romance between the two clan heirs is never fully developed and hardly gets any screen time. The battle scenes are pretty clever and entertaining. All of the characters have some form of special power, and there are duels aplenty to enjoy.This Blu Ray features a pretty gorgeous picture, albeit some spikes in grain and the occasional soft, two-dimensional looking frame. 'Shinobi' doesn't have that 'pop' that is found in the best of HD titles, but it won't disappoint and is certainly a step up from the Standard DVD version. Colors can be vivid (especially in the forest scenes), however it is very inconsistent. Black levels are pretty bad as well, with crush overcoming most of the night scenes along with a drop in contrast. The special effects suffer greatly under the HD spotlight; there were numerous effects that looked too fake (I'm guessing this is due to the enhanced clarity of the picture).The audio quality is pretty impressive, offering up the most minute of audio details in stunning clarity. The battle scenes especially benefit from this; 'Shinobi' takes on a very Anime-like soundtrack that truly compliments the film.This Blu Ray edition ports over all of the standard DVD special features, making of featurettes etc. I was somewhat disappointed that FUNimation didn't transfer the features into HD, but this seems to be a common trend for Blu Ray titles.Overall I was pretty impressed with this film, despite the few arguments I presented earlier. While 'Shinobi' isn't the best of Asian dramas, its certainly a great ninja flick with many Anime like qualities.Movie Quality - 4/5Picture Quality - 3.5/5Audio Quality - 4/5Special Features - 3/5",4,Live action Anime Ninja romance mash up,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,3477,"['Take', 'story', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'mix', 'elements', 'X-Men', 'Ninja', 'fantasy', 'get', ""'Shinobi"", 'Heart', 'Blade', 'Two', 'ninja', 'clans', 'Koga', 'Iga', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'enemies', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'truce', 'heirs', 'leadership', 'clans', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'similar', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'can', 'guess', 'tragic', 'fate', 'awaits', 'shogun', 'who', 'clans', 'threat', 'plot', 'get', 'rid', 'pitting', 'clans', 'other', 'What', 'rather', 'enchanting', 'story', 'marred', 'occasional', 'shoddy', 'CGI', 'effects', 'truly', 'questionable', 'acting.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'Shinobi"", 'great', 'film', 'truly', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'truly', 'live', 'action', 'Anime', 'Sadly', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'feels', 'rather', 'forced', 'times', 'rarely', 'authentic', 'charaters', 'film', 'exhibit', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'qualities', 'Couple', 'most', 'predictable', 'story', 'lines', 'get', 'decent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'amazing', 'majority', 'characters', 'seem', 'almost', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'script', 'motions', 'flesh', 'out', 'back', 'stories', 'motivations', 'intentions', 'clans', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'explored', 'clans', 'are', 'polarized', 'one', 'seemingly', 'other', 'seemingly', 'never', 'really', 'told', 'why', 'could', 'totally', 'be', 'missing', 'mark', 'were', 'observations.It', 'may', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'star', 'rating', 'gave', 'did', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'flaws', 'entertaining', 'film', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'One', 'things', 'film', 'most', 'be', 'romance', 'action', 'film', 'sadly', 'romance', 'portion', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'fray', 'romance', 'two', 'clan', 'heirs', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'hardly', 'screen', 'time', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'have', 'form', 'special', 'power', 'are', 'duels', 'aplenty', 'enjoy.This', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'pretty', 'gorgeous', 'picture', 'spikes', 'grain', 'occasional', 'soft', 'two-dimensional', 'looking', 'frame', ""n't"", 'have', ""'pop"", 'found', 'best', 'HD', 'titles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'Colors', 'can', 'be', 'vivid', 'especially', 'forest', 'scenes', 'however', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'as', 'well', 'crush', 'overcoming', 'most', 'night', 'scenes', 'drop', 'contrast', 'special', 'effects', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'HD', 'spotlight', 'were', 'numerous', 'effects', 'looked', 'too', 'fake', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'due', 'enhanced', 'clarity', 'picture', '.The', 'audio', 'quality', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'offering', 'up', 'most', 'minute', 'audio', 'details', 'stunning', 'clarity', 'battle', 'especially', 'benefit', 'very', 'Anime-like', 'soundtrack', 'truly', 'film.This', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'ports', 'standard', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'featurettes', 'etc', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'FUNimation', 'did', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'features', 'HD', 'be', 'common', 'trend', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'titles.Overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'film', 'few', 'arguments', 'presented', 'earlier', ""n't"", 'best', 'Asian', 'dramas', 'certainly', 'great', 'ninja', 'flick', 'many', 'Anime', 'qualities.Movie', 'Quality', '4/5Picture', 'Quality', '3.5/5Audio', 'Quality', '4/5Special', 'Features', '3/5']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade

The characters looked very good but in reality were very one dimensional, the plot was extremely weak and the computer special effects were somewhat lacking. I did not feel much chemistry between the two main characters, it would also have been nice if they would have thrown in one true love scene between the two when they married each other. I was originally drawn to watch this movie because Jo Odagiri was in it and I had seen him in a movie called Plastic City in which he played a much more flushed out character who I felt much more deeply about than his character in Shinobi Heart Under Blade. I love Japanese movies but unfortunately I had to watch this movie with dubbing which I always feel takes so much away from the aucthenticity of foreign films. If I cannot watch them in their original language with subtitles then something is always missing for me. I thought the dubbing dialogue in this movie was weak although not as cheesy as some dubbed movies I have watched.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 3]","I put this movie on my wish list a while ago and to be honest I didn't know anything about it and forgot about it after some time. I was sitting at home looking for stuff to watch on one really boring night and out of nowhere I see Shinobi on my now favorite TV station the AZN Network. Shinobi is a very simple but strong film and the time will fly by watching it. If you don't know Shinobi is adapted from the book ""The Kouga Ninja Scrolls"" like the anime Basilisk and both use a lot of the same character names. A Shinobi is a ninja with inhuman powers that put them on a entirely different level than normal ninja. The movie is set long ago when two ninja clans had to fight each other in a last man standing battle. The Iga clan and the Koga clan both produce powerful Ninja.5 Shinobi are picked from both clans and the 5 will fight until one is left standing. The true problem is that this film is more of a Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story. The two leaders of the clan are secretly in love and have been keeping this secret for a while. Now that they must go to war with each other the two try and forget about their love and fight like they were trained to do. There is a lot of risks in Shinobi that could destroy the film if done wrong or cheap. The fight sequences are out of this world and very well done. The film uses crazy special effects to increase the power of the shinobi and also show their godly talents. To explain best it is definitely something you would expect only animation could create or a video game. I know that might sound a little impossible but somehow this director and his crew made it look very realistic and exciting. There is little martial arts if any so don't expect that.The acting was good but it's not totally what stood out so it wasn't strong enough to mention. The story itself is simple like I said but still the culture and history make it more interesting. The settings and cinematography were amazing, very clean, and colorful. I only wish that I could've seen this on the big screen. All of the characters were cool and original with great weird personalities. Overall I could understand that some people might take away from this movie seeing the weird cinematography as a fault, the acting or even the simple story. I understand that but I thought this movie was fine and if anything the fights could have had more stylish choreography.

1017690,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B000HXDWOG,maskedgamer,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed the Basilisk Anime and was surprised there was a live movie based on it. The reason I bothered to check this title out is because I was curious to see how they adapted such a well written and greatly animated series into a movie. Basilisk is a pretty heavy anime with a very mature theme of hatred,love,regret,and despair. I had to see how they would be able to fit such a story into 75 minutes or so.I will say that this movie has done one thing for me, and that is appreciate the anime more. I understand that the reason the anime made me angry at the end was because it ended and I wanted more of it. Matter of fact that's the problem with Basilisk/Shinobi. It's over before it even starts. Characters are introduced and then killed off before they even have time to develop. In the anime this happens early on but as the story progresses you get to learn more about the characters fighting but when they die you still feel a connection to them. You honestly don't want anyone to die but it's inevitable. The 400 year long grudge can't be erased so easily.I was disappointed that this movie didn't show the conflict between each character and express their emotions enough. In the anime the characters disagree with their leader but they try to get them to see things their way. They instigate the fighting and go against their leaders. They don't just rush into the battle not even when forced too matter of fact they don't do anything until the very end. I was a bit surprised that Oboro's character was completely removed from how she is supposed to be. She doesn't have the heart to hurt anyone out of hate or revenge. The only time she uses her power is when she is force to use it. Meaning that the one she loved was put in danger and she had to use it to save him.The movie was like I thought it would be. It skipped A LOT of the story and to me it just seemed like scenes in the movie had just been cut out as the story jumped around. I didn't mind so much that they changed the sequence of events,or certain characters. If Kagerou acted and dressed like she really does in the anime she this movie would of been NC-17. It was that I did mind where they skimped the story by not showing the love and passion Kagerou had for Gennosuke. Even though she knew she could never be with him. There were also little things like how Gennosuke's character was changed completely. He's actually a mild manner guy who thinks cautiously and wisely. In the movie his a mix of a hothead,mild mannered guy,and someone completely confused about what he wants to do. In Oboro's camp it's Tenzen that runs the show and Oboro is more of the dog on the leash as she has no control over what her party does. Gennosuke has (some)control over his party. They only fight by going behind his back, and they act the part of listening to and following him. They understand that he doesn't want to fight, but they will still do what they fell is necessary. They will not go against him and disrespect him in his presence.I just never got that feeling watching the movie. The characters personalities just seemed a bit off. Now I'm not going to compare and contrast the two there's really no point to do that any further they are similar but very different still. Those are just a few examples on how the movie differs from the anime itself.The movie contains elements of the basilisk plot and the characters, but it misses out on a lot and in the end carries on into something else that strayed away from the anime. The movie suffered from Miss casted characters and a strong lack of character development. There was a plot but I don't think it weighed on anyone that isn't familiar with the anime. If this was my first time watching I would hate this movie because it would seem shallow.Shinobi had good actions, Okay characters (that never developed),and a someone interesting plot... but it all felt like it needed more TLC to be perfected. A lot could have been done with this movie and honestly I think they could have done much much much better than they did. It's not a bad movie, it's not horrible, it's just a decent movie. Worth watching if you like the anime or manga to check it out in live action but, don't take it too seriously.",3,Depressing...even more so than the Anime.,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,4235,"['enjoyed', 'Basilisk', 'Anime', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'live', 'movie', 'based', 'reason', 'bothered', 'check', 'title', 'out', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'adapted', 'well', 'written', 'greatly', 'animated', 'series', 'movie', 'Basilisk', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'anime', 'very', 'mature', 'theme', 'hatred', 'love', 'regret', 'despair', 'had', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'fit', 'such', 'story', '75', 'minutes', 'so.I', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'done', 'one', 'thing', 'anime', 'more', 'understand', 'reason', 'anime', 'made', 'angry', 'end', 'was', 'ended', 'wanted', 'more', 'Matter', 'fact', 'problem', 'Basilisk/Shinobi', 'over', 'even', 'Characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'killed', 'off', 'even', 'have', 'time', 'develop', 'anime', 'early', 'story', 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'fighting', 'when', 'die', 'still', 'feel', 'connection', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'die', 'inevitable', '400', 'year', 'long', 'grudge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'erased', 'so', 'easily.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'conflict', 'character', 'express', 'emotions', 'enough', 'anime', 'characters', 'disagree', 'leader', 'try', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'instigate', 'fighting', 'go', 'leaders', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'rush', 'battle', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'too', 'matter', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Oboro', 'character', 'was', 'completely', 'removed', 'how', 'supposed', 'be', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'hate', 'revenge', 'only', 'time', 'power', 'when', 'force', 'use', 'Meaning', 'one', 'loved', 'was', 'put', 'danger', 'had', 'use', 'save', 'him.The', 'movie', 'was', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'skipped', 'A', 'LOT', 'story', 'just', 'seemed', 'like', 'scenes', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'story', 'jumped', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'changed', 'sequence', 'events', 'certain', 'characters', 'Kagerou', 'acted', 'dressed', 'really', 'anime', 'movie', 'would', 'been', 'NC-17', 'was', 'did', 'mind', 'where', 'skimped', 'story', 'not', 'showing', 'love', 'passion', 'Kagerou', 'had', 'Gennosuke', 'Even', 'knew', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'were', 'also', 'little', 'things', 'how', 'Gennosuke', 'character', 'was', 'changed', 'completely', 'actually', 'mild', 'manner', 'guy', 'who', 'cautiously', 'wisely', 'movie', 'mix', 'hothead', 'mild', 'mannered', 'guy', 'someone', 'completely', 'confused', 'what', 'do', 'Oboro', 'camp', 'Tenzen', 'show', 'Oboro', 'more', 'dog', 'leash', 'control', 'what', 'party', 'Gennosuke', 'control', 'party', 'only', 'fight', 'going', 'back', 'act', 'part', 'listening', 'following', 'understand', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'will', 'still', 'do', 'what', 'fell', 'necessary', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'disrespect', 'presence.I', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'feeling', 'watching', 'movie', 'characters', 'personalities', 'just', 'seemed', 'bit', 'off', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'compare', 'contrast', 'two', 'really', 'point', 'do', 'further', 'are', 'similar', 'very', 'different', 'still', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'how', 'movie', 'differs', 'anime', 'itself.The', 'movie', 'elements', 'basilisk', 'plot', 'characters', 'out', 'lot', 'end', 'something', 'else', 'strayed', 'away', 'anime', 'movie', 'suffered', 'Miss', 'casted', 'characters', 'strong', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'weighed', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'anime', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'would', 'hate', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'shallow.Shinobi', 'had', 'good', 'actions', 'Okay', 'characters', 'never', 'developed', 'someone', 'interesting', 'plot', 'felt', 'needed', 'more', 'TLC', 'be', 'perfected', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'movie', 'honestly', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'just', 'decent', 'movie', 'watching', 'like', 'anime', 'manga', 'check', 'out', 'live', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade

1017692,A3DH53FPYSP9E,B000HXDWOG,Media Man,"[1, 3]","In the 80's I grew up hooked on the ninja fad.  I watched every cheesy ninja movie that I could find in the video store and Sho Kosugi was my idol.  That being said I still enjoy watching martial arts/ninja films now just as much as when I was a kid.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade fits right in with your typical ninja film.  Basic premise, two main ninja clans in 17th Century Japan must each pick their 5 best warriors to compete against each other in a race to appease the Emperor.  In order to appreciate this film you need to understand that the Japanese code of honor is very strict.  If that means killing your lover to appease the Emperor, so be it.  Of course at the heart of the story (no pun intended) is a typical Romeo and Juliet relationship but honestly that's not really why people watch ninja movies!  You want to see cool martial arts moves and lots of killing.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade delivers most of what you want, just not enough of it.  My thoughts;Pros+ Plenty of unique ninjas all with their own special skills/powers to differentiate them.+ Story adheres to traditional Japanese beliefs in the code of honor and that the Emperor is near divine.+ Beautiful cinematography.+ Great fight scenes (albiet way too short).Cons- Nearly all of the 5 chosen ninjas from each clan die way to quickly, many having very cheap and unsatisfying deaths.  A huge loss in the story honestly.- Absolutely no back story on any of the ninjas skills, training or upbringing.  Just slight mentions.- Action sequences are extremely slim.  They spend way too much time focusing on the love story than they do the fight sequences, which in my opinion is what the majority of people watching this movie want to see.- Master's of both clans must fight to the death yet there's absolutely no scene in the film of it.  Very disappointing!While I did really enjoy the movie it could have been so much better had more content been included.  It felt more like a drama than an action movie.  Whether or not that's what the director wanted I'm not sure, but the movie loses a star because of it.  If they had simply put more action and backstory on the main characters I would have easily given the film 5 stars.

Still in the mood for some action, I purchased and watched, Shinobi...  Wow, what a waste of time this movie was.....  It took me two attempts to get through it.  First, the movie is slow.. secondly, the costumes are just out right bad.. some are even silly.  One fellow is wearing what looks like a left over Adidas striped jogging suit from 1971.  The sleeves on this suit were super long and he had these spaghetti like threads that went out and grabbed all his enemies.... and another guy, well, for the first half hour I was not sure if he was a guy or a girl, his lip-stick was too thick.  Still, another guy looked like a giant pea pod with a face and the lead guy had some silly punk rock hair-do and looked like he would be more comfortable in a skin tight, pink patten leather, sparkle covered suit.  There was NO real martial arts technique in the movie and the actors did not come across very strong... except this one guy who threw darts...  He, in my opinion, was the best actor in the whole movie.... other than his good acting, I think the movie was just boring and sad....

1017694,A2XVRMODZKON7B,B000HXDWOG,Missy Machete,"[0, 0]","I first saw Shinobi with a half-Japanese friend of mine who was not really into martial arts, but who had fallen in love with this movie. He wanted me to watch it too, and I did. Like him, I also fell in love with it. I am not big into martial arts and I expected to be bored out of my mind while watching this, but I was quickly sucked in to the intricate, multi-layered story line. All throughout this movie I kept wondering if it was truly live-action or if it was just exceptionally well-done animation and to this day I still don't know which is true. It reminds me of one of the Final Fantasy movies I watched with my parents, the one where the girl has to find the last living essences of spirit that are lurking in an otherwise dead world. I don't remember what that movie was called but I loved it as well, and it haunted my dreams for years.Back to Shinobi. I think it's the love story, and the agonizing struggle of duty and honor vs love that continues to draw me back to Shinobi, time and time again. It's a nice touch that each of the five (six?) warriors chosen by the rival competing teams have different strengths, and outside of the two who participate in the demonstration for the Shogun, we don't get to see what that specific character's strength is until they actually fight with it.The imagery is also stunning. After watching this and other movies set in Japan, I REALLY want to visit, if only just to view the spectacular natural scenery. The only thing that I would change about Shinobi would be to add more depth to the characters, especially the two main leads. The female lead seems indifferent to her love at most times throughout the movie, while her male counterpart is far more demonstrative. Or maybe she's distant because she's sad at the knowledge that their love is ultimately doomed.Either way, this is a lovely movie, and one of my all-time favorites.

Both movies have beautiful cinematography and great actions scenes.  This movie had a little better acting and thus the extra star.Honestly, I don't understand why these Japanese film makers cannot produce a decent plot.  For so many reviewers to give these movies 5 stars and say the visuals are so awesome that a plot is not needed is ridiculous.  I do not consider myself that particular in this area but seriously, this plot has monumental errors.  Let me give just a few examples...***Warning: Spoilers Ahead***1) We are made to believe that the two protagonists are deeply in love with each other.  Both are summoned to fight in front of the emperor with their respective teams.  Yet the female attacks the male on the journey and he allows her to kill him.  Prior to this, the male character learns that a member of the female team named Tenzen has betrayed them and both of their villages are under attack while they are away.  Wouldn't our male protagonist say to his love, ""Dear, we should go and defend our villages instead of me allowing you to kill me""?2) As mentioned above, Tenzen betrays both villages by revealing their locations to the emperor.  Yet there is no scene regarding this activity or any motivation by Tenzen for his betrayal.  In addition, wouldn't the emperor already know of the location of the villages since at the beginning of the movie, he summons the elders of each village to demonstrate their skills?3) So now we have the villages under attack.  These villages are supposed to be populated with amazing Shinobi warriors and yet when they are attacked by the emperor's forces, they run around like idiots with no fighting abilities whatsoever.  In addition, the emperor manages to sneak up on the village with cannons and  heavy infantry without being seen or heard, even though the village is in the cliff above them and could easily spot them a mile away.  Remember, these villages are at war.  You would think that there would be at least one sentry posted.4) Finally the female begs the emperor to spare the villages and somehow the emperor manages to send this message to the attacking forces before they destroy the small village, something which appears like it would take about an hour to achieve.  How does the message get all the way from the emperor located in the capital city to the hidden village in such a short time before the village is destroyed?  If the village and the city are such a short distance apart, then how could they have been hidden in the first place?And folks, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Again, it is like the producer said, ""We have all of these cool computer effects so let us write a story to demonstrate our amazing capabilities"".

The movie is supposed to revolve around the battle between the Iga and the Kouga, but it's also supposed to be mainly around the two lovers Oboro and Gennosuke. You barely see them together, and more time is spent on  very brief but visually stunning battle sequences between the Iga and Kouga Ninjas. Isn't the point of a tragic romance to actually SHOW the romance a bit more? There's also lack of character development too, but considering how long you see some of them on the screen, it probably wasn't worth the director's time anyway. It's almost like the director chose the characters he wanted to showcase and threw the rest under a rug. Visually, this movie is stunning! The locations for Manjidani and Tsubagakure are completely different but very beautiful and show how much both ninja villages vary. Manjidani is a mountainous area that is more arid, whilst Tsubagakure is near a river and is surrounded by greenery. The special effects are AMAZING and you can tell that a majority of the director's budget was spent here instead of making more of a story. Overall, it's worth it to see this movie at least once.

1017702,A1IN0ZW0794UE1,B000HXDWOG,Shawn Carroll,"[0, 0]","My wife and I decided to watch this after seeing a preview for it. A word of warning.  As with many previews, you got the impression of an action film that was mostly combat.  It would be a profound disappointment for anyone expecting that, as it has both plot and a rich historical and cultural background that is often lacking from action films.We had both seen and love ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and enjoyed ""The House of Flying Daggers.""  This movie lies somewhere between the two, and should not disappoint if you let it stand on its own instead of judging it on the manga on which it is based.  The cinematography and scenery is absolutely gorgeous, and rates at least two stars.  The combat sequences are excellent, amazingly so given the moderate budget this film had.  The film could not climb much above three stars if that was all it had.  However, it also has a story, that is both solid and at times, clever.The story does not exactly translate into the neat category of ""tragedy"" (and of course ""comedy"") that Western literature often falls into.  However, the world it occurs in is very different.  This is the Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, when the Tokegawa Shogunate was established and began a reign of peace, stability, and stagnation that would last over 200 years.The Shinobi are mystical warriors who have thrived on the conflicts of the preceding centuries.  They no longer fit in this world of peace, yet there is no simple way to deal with them.  The movie revolves around this conflict, between the two conflicting Shinobi clans and the new Japan that has no place for them.  From these basic ideas the plot of the movie flows, and it does it quite well.  It helps to understand some of the basics of Japanese culture, from the reverence for the authority (the Shogun in this case as the representative of the Emperor though the Shogun is actually in charge - as I said, this is Japan) to the omnipresent, and sometimes suffocating, sense of obligation that pervaded the culture, and how Japan has had to deal with seismic cultural shifts many times in the past.There are not plot spoilers here, everything is explained fairly well during the first 20 or 30 minutes.  The story is a love story, caught within a web of obligation, destiny, and fate that makes it doomed from the start.  Kouga Gennosuke refuses to accept this, and heroically struggles against the obligations and tradition that require him to see his true love, Oboro, as the enemy since she is from the opposing clan.  She is more fatalistic, and the film takes this love and sets against not just this conflict but the determination of the Shogunate that the Shinobi represent a threat to the new peace that has been established.  To solve this ""problem"", the Shogunate decides to require the five strongest warriors from each clan to fight to the death, with the winning side determining the next Shogun.The movie takes off from there.  There are numerous combats as Kouga Gennosuke tries to prevent, and when he is unable to do this, limit the carnage from the challenge.  Of course, being feudal Japan, the machinations of those in charge are a backdrop that continues to add more and more complexity that is revealed as the remainder of the film progresses.  If you are unfamiliar with the orignal anime, you are never quite sure if the two lovers will escape their fate.  The ending caught us by surprise.  It is neither ""happy"" nor ""tragic"" in the context of Japan and it's culture.  Instead there is a unexpected twist as these warriors, rejected by the new era, give their people one last chance, with a sacrifice and surrender that is profound, and uncommon in Western cinema.",4,Shinboi - History Meets Fantasy and Does It Well,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,3697,"['wife', 'decided', 'watch', 'seeing', 'preview', 'word', 'warning', 'many', 'previews', 'got', 'impression', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'combat', 'would', 'be', 'profound', 'disappointment', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'plot', 'rich', 'historical', 'cultural', 'background', 'often', 'lacking', 'action', 'films.We', 'had', 'seen', 'love', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'enjoyed', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'two', 'should', 'not', 'disappoint', 'let', 'stand', 'own', 'instead', 'judging', 'manga', 'based', 'cinematography', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'rates', 'least', 'two', 'stars', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'excellent', 'amazingly', 'so', 'given', 'moderate', 'budget', 'film', 'had', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'climb', 'much', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'had', 'However', 'also', 'story', 'solid', 'times', 'clever.The', 'story', 'not', 'exactly', 'translate', 'neat', 'category', 'tragedy', 'course', 'comedy', 'Western', 'literature', 'often', 'However', 'world', 'very', 'different', 'Japan', 'end', 'Sengoku', 'period', 'when', 'Tokegawa', 'Shogunate', 'was', 'established', 'began', 'reign', 'peace', 'stability', 'stagnation', 'would', 'last', '200', 'years.The', 'Shinobi', 'are', 'mystical', 'warriors', 'who', 'have', 'thrived', 'conflicts', 'preceding', 'centuries', 'no', 'longer', 'fit', 'world', 'peace', 'yet', 'simple', 'way', 'deal', 'movie', 'conflict', 'two', 'conflicting', 'Shinobi', 'clans', 'new', 'Japan', 'place', 'basic', 'ideas', 'plot', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'understand', 'basics', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'reverence', 'authority', 'Shogun', 'case', 'representative', 'Emperor', 'Shogun', 'actually', 'charge', 'said', 'Japan', 'omnipresent', 'sometimes', 'suffocating', 'sense', 'obligation', 'pervaded', 'culture', 'how', 'Japan', 'had', 'deal', 'seismic', 'cultural', 'shifts', 'many', 'times', 'past.There', 'are', 'not', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'everything', 'explained', 'fairly', 'well', 'first', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'caught', 'web', 'obligation', 'destiny', 'fate', 'doomed', 'start', 'Kouga', 'Gennosuke', 'accept', 'heroically', 'struggles', 'obligations', 'tradition', 'see', 'true', 'love', 'Oboro', 'enemy', 'opposing', 'clan', 'more', 'fatalistic', 'film', 'love', 'sets', 'not', 'just', 'conflict', 'determination', 'Shogunate', 'Shinobi', 'represent', 'threat', 'new', 'peace', 'been', 'established', 'solve', 'problem', 'Shogunate', 'require', 'five', 'strongest', 'warriors', 'clan', 'fight', 'death', 'winning', 'side', 'determining', 'next', 'Shogun.The', 'movie', 'there', 'are', 'numerous', 'combats', 'Kouga', 'Gennosuke', 'prevent', 'when', 'unable', 'do', 'limit', 'carnage', 'challenge', 'course', 'being', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'machinations', 'charge', 'are', 'backdrop', 'add', 'more', 'more', 'complexity', 'revealed', 'remainder', 'film', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'orignal', 'anime', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'two', 'lovers', 'will', 'escape', 'fate', 'ending', 'caught', 'surprise', 'happy', 'tragic', 'context', 'Japan', 'culture', 'Instead', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'warriors', 'rejected', 'new', 'era', 'give', 'people', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'sacrifice', 'surrender', 'profound', 'uncommon', 'Western', 'cinema']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade

I've always been fascinated with ninjas and the culture surrounding them, when I was younger this fascination expressed itself through video games, and now that I'm older it's done through books, movies, and anime. There are quite a bit of movies about Ninjas, some good; some horrible... this one falls towards the good end. From the beginning you'll notice this film is very visually stylized... there is plenty of slow motion, bright colors, and CG. I quite enjoyed the look of the film, even though you're going to have to forgive some of the special effects; they're passable but nowhere near big budget Hollywood quality.The story is pretty intriguing, and involves what can best be summarized as a forbidden romance during a time of struggle between two clans. I was surprised that there was a great humanistic message hidden here within all the swordplay, which towards the end gets driven home pretty hard. Many of the shinobi in the movie have really cool unique powers, and it makes the movie a lot of fun in my opinion.

1017705,A2S0UXAWV52WZ2,B000HXDWOG,"Steven Fujita ""Steven Fujita, author of &#34;...","[6, 8]","I purchased this film just based on the storyline, and since I'm not familiar with the novel, nor the anime, I didn't think I had to do any comparision.  However, I did compare, but not on purpose, it just turned out that way.  The Iga vs Koga intrigued me, the love story intrigued me, the Tokugawas wanting to wipe out the troublesome villages intrigued me.  I had to watch this film. While I don't regret purchasing the film, I must say that I was diappointed in it as I watched.What did I compare it to?  The first Kage No Gundan which starred Sonny Chiba as a Hattori Hanzo.  Although that was an episodic television show, that too was primarily Iga vs Koga, it too had a tragic love story between the leader of the Iga and one of the leaders of the Koga and it too, complained that the Shogunate liked to play off the Iga and Koga against each other. Perhaps Kage No Gundan I gives a better essence of the novel, Kouga Ninja Scrolls because this movie just didn't do it for me.In this story, Tokugawa Ieyasu summons the leaders of two rival ninja villages, one Iga, and one Koga, which happen to be neighbors, and observes a demonstration of each village's talents.  he sets up a tournament in which 5 of the best fighters of each village fight each other.  Two of the participants  are the heirs to the two villages, who happen to be in love with each other. There is an ulterior motive to all this, and without giving away the rest of the plot, let's just say that Tokugawa finds ninjas to be a danger to his rule.The tournament is that the village of the one survivor who makes it to the castle will win and the Ieyasu's heir will be determined.  Thus, on their way to the castle, the individuals fight each other.  This is the bulk of the action for the film.  The special effects are the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon variety, but not as elaborate, and not as good.  Because it relies on special effects, and the characters, we are told, have extraordinary abilities - somewhat like the mutants in the universe of Marvel Comics, the martial arts is also lacking - especially when compared to Kage No Gundan.Lots of stuff reminds me of Kage No Gundan I.  First the plot as stated in the second paragraph of this review.  Second, Koga ninja Gennosuke, played by Joe Odagiri, reminds me of Hattori Hanzo, except that Odagiri plays the Koga heir as a subtle strong silent type.  Third, some of the dialogue.  Although different characters in the movie say these lines, I could swear that some of the dialogue is exactly what the Hattori Hanzo character would say Kage No Gundan I.  But do I think the movie was paying tribute to it?  No, I don't think so - I think it was just trying to adapt the story it was based on. Needless to say, however, I liked the dialogue, but I think Sony Chiba delivered those lines better.So, what I liked was the plot, the dialogue, and also impressed with Joe Odagiri's intrepretation of Koga Gennosuke.  I was not too impressed with the fight scenes.  And I was really disppointed in the execution of the storyline.  I wish they could have developed the characters more fully, so I could relate to them better. And while it is fine for fans of shinobi, for the less knowledgeable, there should have been a better explanation of why Tokugawa viewed ninjas as a threat.  I also think the movie should have given Hattori Hanzo a bigger role somehow leading to some intrigue, given he was an Iga himself.Bottom line is that it's an all right movie.  If you are a big fan of shinobi plots, or you are a big fan of any of the actors, you should see it for the sake of seeing it, otherwise, it's okay to pass this one up - there are better choices for ninja films and there are better choices for the Romeo and Juliet type of tragic love story.",2,Somewhat of a disappointment,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,3779,"['purchased', 'film', 'just', 'based', 'storyline', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'novel', 'anime', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'do', 'comparision', 'However', 'did', 'compare', 'not', 'purpose', 'just', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'Iga', 'vs', 'Koga', 'intrigued', 'love', 'story', 'intrigued', 'Tokugawas', 'wanting', 'wipe', 'out', 'troublesome', 'villages', 'intrigued', 'had', 'watch', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'purchasing', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'diappointed', 'watched.What', 'did', 'compare', 'first', 'Kage', 'No', 'Gundan', 'starred', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'Hattori', 'Hanzo', 'was', 'episodic', 'television', 'show', 'too', 'was', 'primarily', 'Iga', 'vs', 'Koga', 'too', 'had', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'leader', 'Iga', 'one', 'leaders', 'Koga', 'too', 'complained', 'Shogunate', 'liked', 'play', 'off', 'Iga', 'Koga', 'other', 'Perhaps', 'Kage', 'No', 'Gundan', 'better', 'essence', 'novel', 'Kouga', 'Ninja', 'Scrolls', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'me.In', 'story', 'Tokugawa', 'Ieyasu', 'leaders', 'two', 'rival', 'ninja', 'villages', 'one', 'Iga', 'one', 'Koga', 'happen', 'be', 'neighbors', 'demonstration', 'village', 'talents', 'up', 'tournament', '5', 'best', 'fighters', 'village', 'fight', 'other', 'Two', 'participants', 'are', 'heirs', 'two', 'villages', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'love', 'other', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'giving', 'away', 'rest', 'plot', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Tokugawa', 'ninjas', 'be', 'danger', 'rule.The', 'tournament', 'village', 'one', 'survivor', 'who', 'castle', 'will', 'win', 'Ieyasu', 'heir', 'will', 'be', 'determined', 'Thus', 'way', 'castle', 'individuals', 'fight', 'other', 'bulk', 'action', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'variety', 'not', 'elaborate', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'characters', 'are', 'told', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'somewhat', 'mutants', 'universe', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'martial', 'arts', 'also', 'lacking', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Kage', 'No', 'Gundan.Lots', 'stuff', 'reminds', 'Kage', 'No', 'Gundan', 'First', 'plot', 'stated', 'second', 'paragraph', 'review', 'Second', 'Koga', 'ninja', 'Gennosuke', 'played', 'Joe', 'Odagiri', 'Hattori', 'Hanzo', 'Odagiri', 'Koga', 'heir', 'subtle', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'Third', 'dialogue', 'different', 'characters', 'movie', 'say', 'lines', 'could', 'swear', 'dialogue', 'exactly', 'what', 'Hattori', 'Hanzo', 'character', 'would', 'say', 'Kage', 'No', 'Gundan', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'paying', 'tribute', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'adapt', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'Needless', 'say', 'however', 'liked', 'dialogue', 'think', 'Sony', 'Chiba', 'delivered', 'lines', 'better.So', 'what', 'liked', 'was', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'also', 'impressed', 'Joe', 'Odagiri', 'intrepretation', 'Koga', 'Gennosuke', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'impressed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'really', 'disppointed', 'execution', 'storyline', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'characters', 'more', 'fully', 'could', 'relate', 'better', 'fine', 'fans', 'shinobi', 'less', 'knowledgeable', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'explanation', 'why', 'Tokugawa', 'viewed', 'ninjas', 'threat', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Hattori', 'Hanzo', 'bigger', 'role', 'somehow', 'leading', 'intrigue', 'given', 'was', 'Iga', 'himself.Bottom', 'line', 'all', 'right', 'movie', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'shinobi', 'plots', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'actors', 'should', 'see', 'sake', 'seeing', 'otherwise', 'okay', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'are', 'better', 'choices', 'ninja', 'films', 'are', 'better', 'choices', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'type', 'tragic', 'love', 'story']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade

1017710,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HXDWOG,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 9]","`Shinobi' means in Japanese `'concealment' or `clandestine' and the word is often used as an archaic and slightly elegant way of referring to `ninja.' This Japanese film ""SHINOBI"" released in 2005 is exactly what the title says - lots of battles between the feuding ninja clans and the romance of the star-crossed lovers.The story is set in the early 17th century in Japan, when the Tokugawa dynasty (or the Shogun) has taken the control of the whole nation of Japan, and the peace is about to be realized. That means, however, a precarious position for two rival ninja clans - Koga and Iga - both people who are raised to be deadly assassins. In short, they have no place to live in this peaceful era to come.Tokugawa decrees that each of these clans pick up five of their best ninjas, and have them fight. Among the ten fighters are Iga's beautiful woman Oboro (Yukie Nakama) and Koga's handsome Gennosuke (Jo Odagiri), both secretly in love with one another.The film is based on the novel `Koga Ninpouchou' (serialized 1958-59) written by Japanese writer Futarou Yamada (1922-2001). The film gives emphasis to Romeo and Juliet-like element of the original which was changed considerably for the film. The novel is also turned into comic ""Basilisk,"" which was later made into animation (don't forget checking out the DVDs).The film ""SHINOBI"" is shot with stylish battle scenes and beautiful cinematography. The actions lack the graceful movements of characters in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but the fights themselves are competently done, and most (if not all) ninja skills are unique and interesting. Actors are mostly great, especially the two leads. Yukie Nakama is hugely popular and recognized as one of the talented actors in Japan, and so is Jo Odagiri. If you see them, you will see the reasons instantly.Still I must give only three stars because of the two reasons. One is the script of which weakness gets obvious in the middle part. The motives of some characters such as Gennnosuke going to the Shogun's castle are not clear. Actually many Japanese viewers complained of the weak storyline that fails to convince us why they should fight each other in the first place. Reasons are explained, but not strong and sufficient enough. [In 2005 the film was awarded worst film by Bunshun Magazine's Kiichogo Award that started in 2004. I for one don't think it deserves this Japanese Razzie Award (kiichigo means raspberry), but it is certain many of us are disappointed.]My great disappointment is the battle scenes themselves. Surely they are done with styles, but they show neither the life-or-death thrills of fighting nor the extraordinary ninjutu (skills of ninja) that made the original book famous and popular. You see only a glimpse of what these ninjas can do, or the complicated relations between them, which makes the world of the original more colorful than the filmed version. The film is good, and some parts are truly moving, but there are more to the original and its hugely amazing ninja world.",3,Beautiful and Stylish Ninja Flick with a Romeo and Juliet Touch,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3028,"['Shinobi', 'means', 'Japanese', ""'concealment"", 'clandestine', 'word', 'often', 'used', 'archaic', 'slightly', 'elegant', 'way', 'referring', 'ninja', 'Japanese', 'film', 'SHINOBI', 'released', '2005', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'lots', 'battles', 'feuding', 'ninja', 'clans', 'romance', 'star-crossed', 'lovers.The', 'story', 'set', 'early', '17th', 'century', 'Japan', 'when', 'Tokugawa', 'dynasty', 'Shogun', 'taken', 'control', 'whole', 'nation', 'Japan', 'peace', 'be', 'realized', 'however', 'precarious', 'position', 'two', 'rival', 'ninja', 'clans', 'Koga', 'Iga', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'raised', 'be', 'deadly', 'assassins', 'short', 'have', 'place', 'live', 'peaceful', 'era', 'come.Tokugawa', 'decrees', 'clans', 'pick', 'up', 'five', 'best', 'ninjas', 'have', 'fight', 'ten', 'fighters', 'are', 'Iga', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Oboro', 'Yukie', 'Nakama', 'Koga', 'handsome', 'Gennosuke', 'Jo', 'Odagiri', 'secretly', 'love', 'one', 'another.The', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Koga', 'Ninpouchou', 'serialized', '1958-59', 'written', 'Japanese', 'writer', 'Futarou', 'Yamada', '1922-2001', 'film', 'emphasis', 'Romeo', 'Juliet-like', 'element', 'original', 'was', 'changed', 'considerably', 'film', 'novel', 'also', 'turned', 'comic', 'Basilisk', 'was', 'later', 'made', 'animation', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'checking', 'DVDs', '.The', 'film', 'SHINOBI', 'shot', 'stylish', 'battle', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'actions', 'lack', 'graceful', 'movements', 'characters', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'fights', 'are', 'competently', 'done', 'most', 'not', 'ninja', 'skills', 'are', 'unique', 'interesting', 'Actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'great', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'Yukie', 'Nakama', 'hugely', 'popular', 'recognized', 'one', 'talented', 'actors', 'Japan', 'so', 'Jo', 'Odagiri', 'see', 'will', 'see', 'reasons', 'instantly.Still', 'must', 'give', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'script', 'weakness', 'obvious', 'middle', 'part', 'motives', 'characters', 'such', 'Gennnosuke', 'going', 'Shogun', 'castle', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'Actually', 'many', 'Japanese', 'viewers', 'complained', 'weak', 'storyline', 'convince', 'why', 'should', 'fight', 'other', 'first', 'place', 'Reasons', 'are', 'explained', 'not', 'strong', 'sufficient', 'enough', '[', '2005', 'film', 'was', 'awarded', 'worst', 'film', 'Bunshun', 'Magazine', 'Kiichogo', 'Award', 'started', '2004', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Japanese', 'Razzie', 'Award', 'kiichigo', 'raspberry', 'certain', 'many', 'are', 'disappointed', ']', 'My', 'great', 'disappointment', 'battle', 'Surely', 'are', 'done', 'styles', 'show', 'life-or-death', 'thrills', 'fighting', 'extraordinary', 'ninjutu', 'skills', 'ninja', 'made', 'original', 'book', 'famous', 'popular', 'see', 'only', 'glimpse', 'what', 'ninjas', 'can', 'do', 'complicated', 'relations', 'world', 'original', 'more', 'colorful', 'filmed', 'version', 'film', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'truly', 'moving', 'are', 'more', 'original', 'hugely', 'amazing', 'ninja', 'world']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade
1017711,A1JRUSI8U5B88I,B000HXDWOG,WiltDurkey,"[2, 4]","I got this because it was one of the cheaper blu-rays that I hadn't seen and might care to see.  Not a great choice as it turns out.  Shinobi is pretty dull.Camera : many quasi-still shots showing the characters' faces to best effect.  Forlorn and wistful being their usual facial expression.  Their destiny (big capital letters implied) is calling, cue ponderous music.  The male lead looks especially haunted (but with an amazingly trendy Japanese haircut).  The female lead is pretty and... haunted.  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, the haunted look concludes Shinobi's character development section.  Visuals similar to House of Flying Daggers, but not as beautiful or subtle.Plot?  Meh.  Others have already reviewed it and there is little more to be told.  It doesn't help that the viewers are let in on the Shogun's big secret desire to wipe out the Shinobis at the beginning.  OK, martial arts movies aren't necessarily the place to look for great plots.  But Shinobi is lamer than many, despite (because of?) its melodramatic Romeo & Juliet pretensions.Action?  Well, the director is not Ang Lee, that's for sure (and yes, I know Ang Lee didn't do martial arts before you know what).  There are some good special effects, but again little in the way of camera dynamics.  The fights manage to be stylish and boring.  No Ong Bak, Shaolin, Jackie Chan or Jet Li here.  Not Fight Club either.  Those other films get their actors sweaty with in-your-face action, but almost everything here is resolved by various super-powers of dubious interest and cheap CGI wizardry.  Nobody breaks a sweat or musses up their hair.So, if you have an action movie with uninteresting action, nice-ish pix, and a warmed over plot, what's left?  A nice showcase for blu-ray technology at cut prices.Many positive reviewers seem to be anime fans.  I am not.  I like animation movies in general, but dislike most Japanese anime besides Miyazaki and a few others.

1017712,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000HXDWOG,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[50, 58]","The dvd of SHINOBI HEART UNDER BLADE U.S. version is almost an exact duplicate of the Region-3 Thai version. I have both the 3-disc Japanese region-2 copy and the Hong Kong Region-3 DTS-ES dvd. The japanese and Hk releases have the best transfers. If you have multi-region capability, buy the Japanese or Hong Kong versions. But whatever you do, do not miss this film.The following review applies to the Hong Kong Region-3 release:I just finished watching my dvd copy of this film and felt that I have to review this marvelously tragic but hopeful film. Mind you, this SHINOBI film does not follow any of the video-game inspired Shinobi titles, rather it is based on the JAPANESE FEUDAL LEGEND from which both the video game and the anime series ""Basilisk"" were based on.In order for you to love this film, you have to have an idea of Japanese customs and their unrelenting loyalty to their emperor/leader. For them, their Emperor is like a living God-man. That is why when a new Shogunate has united feudal Japan, he fears that the wrath of the SHINOBI may upset the balance of power. SHINOBI is the elite NINJA clan, who has been trained since birth in the art of combat and warfare.Two Ninja clans has had a truce for years that the new Lord of the shogunate has lifted this truce and has misled them into believing that each clan will help decide who will ascend to the role of shogun(in the future) should they have 5 of their greatest and most skilled warriors to battle each other in a contest to the death. Gennusuke and Oboro are the lovers caught in the middle because each have ascended to the role of chieftain in their respective clans. In truth, the Shogunate rulers wish to destroy their clans because they fear their powers/skills and that one day rise up against the Supreme Shogunate of Japan. They believe since their goal is peace and prosperity, war mongers should be extinct because they believe that without war, they have no purpose. Some members of the clans also believe this.Each clan warrior has character and depth, with variable skills and abilities. One warrior is like a chameleon, one has simian-like agility, one has NEAR-immortality, a woman has poison that goes around her skin/breath, one is a blind psychic among others.The film itself is very tragic and when Oboro makes the supreme sacrifice to save the children/families of both clans, even the shogunate had to believe that the SHINOBI can have more than one purpose in life.The set designs were awesome and the characters were well designed. The special effects weren't all hokey and fit the movie's pace. As in most samurai films, the battles were quick and exciting, although not overly bloody.The film is one of the best ASIAN fantasy-epic films I've seen thus far. The dvd I have was mastered in High-def widescreen(EXTREMELY SHARP transfer) with 5.1 (DTS)digital audio(I didn't get mind in AMAZON). I highly recommend this film, now I have to cry for a PREQUEL about the warring clans before! 4.5 stars all the way!!Kagero ROCKS!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ADDED: I managed to see the U.S. region-1 release by Funimation. It is less than 2 minutes shorter than the region-3 DTS-ES Hong Kong release. Nothing relevant was missing, except for an extended beginning and Oboro's encounter with one of the Kouga warriors. The video of the Asian release is a lot sharper/crisper than the Funimation transfer.

1017713,A1XMETZBIAWAI9,B000HXDWOG,Wrath,"[1, 1]",This movie for me was a bit of a let down now that is not to say that it was completely terrible and there is no likability here but honestly I was expecting WAY more than what I got. I think I would have been way more impressed with this movie had I not ever seen Basilisk or if the movie had followed that storyline a bit more closely but since I have I kept getting the feeling like this movie was lacking because it didn't really bring anything intensely original to the story nor did it play to fans of the series so it was kind of in the middle. I have to say that the ending 20 to 30 minutes are probably the best but for the most part it just seemed like Japan wanted an excuse to put Ayumi Hamasaki in a movie. Considering it is done by Funimation (who also produces Basilisk) I wasn't expecting too much so I bought it from a second hand vendor for way cheaper than Amazon's listing price. All in all I say save your self the time and just buy Basilisk.,3,Decent For The Right Price,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,963,"['movie', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'now', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'terrible', 'likability', 'here', 'honestly', 'was', 'expecting', 'WAY', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'more', 'impressed', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'ever', 'seen', 'Basilisk', 'movie', 'had', 'followed', 'storyline', 'bit', 'more', 'closely', 'have', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'intensely', 'original', 'story', 'did', 'play', 'fans', 'series', 'was', 'kind', 'middle', 'have', 'say', 'ending', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'seemed', 'Japan', 'wanted', 'excuse', 'put', 'Ayumi', 'Hamasaki', 'movie', 'Considering', 'done', 'Funimation', 'who', 'also', 'Basilisk', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'bought', 'second', 'hand', 'vendor', 'way', 'cheaper', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'price', 'say', 'save', 'time', 'just', 'buy', 'Basilisk']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade
1017714,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000HXDWOG,Zack Davisson,"[21, 28]","""Shinobi"" is Japan's attempt to make a big martial arts fantasy epic, obviously inspired by the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the revived interest overseas in Chinese wuxia flicks.  The problem is, martial arts fantasy isn't really Japan's forte.  Japanese period films tend to focus more on the duty/passion conflict inherent in the samurai, whose sword-skills are precise rather than flashy.  A single-cut kill is the apex of the art of the samurai, not flying around on trees and flinging millions of little knives all at once.As source material, the 1959 novel ""The Koga Ninja Scrolls"", previously adapted as the anime series ""Basilisk"", was a good base, using the traditional conflict between the Iga and Koga ninja villages with a Romeo/Juliet love story thrown in for good measure.  (The director is sure to hammer this point home, even stating several times that the two are ""star-crossed lovers""). Director Ten Shimoyama was also a good choice, having experience in the Chinese action film industry, and was able to supply some of the dramatic action that is a hallmark of that genre.  The lead actress Yukie Nakama brought some star power, being probably the most popular actress in Japan today.  They were even good enough to skirt around her inability to fight, as Yukie has all the martial arts ability of a broom stick.  But she does have an awfully pretty face, which was used to full effect.All in all, ""Shinobi"" is a good flick, better than I had expected.  There is not really the experience there, either on the part of the actors or the director, to produce a really moving martial arts fantasy, but everyone worked with what they had, keeping the action low-key and making the emotions of the characters the focus.  Because the basis of the story is the Romeo/Juliet conflict, nobody is really expecting a happy ending, but even with that in mind the character's deaths have impact, and even then not everything turns out exactly as expected.  Some of the choices were odd, and I am not really sure what is the point of including legendary warriors Hattori Hanzo and Jubei Yagyu in the plot without sending them into battle, and they serve as little more than recognizable set decoration.",4,Our stars are crossed...,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2227,"['Shinobi', 'Japan', 'attempt', 'make', 'big', 'martial', 'arts', 'fantasy', 'epic', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'success', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'revived', 'interest', 'overseas', 'Chinese', 'wuxia', 'flicks', 'problem', 'martial', 'arts', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'really', 'Japan', 'forte', 'Japanese', 'period', 'films', 'tend', 'focus', 'more', 'duty/passion', 'conflict', 'inherent', 'samurai', 'sword-skills', 'are', 'rather', 'flashy', 'single-cut', 'kill', 'apex', 'art', 'samurai', 'not', 'flying', 'around', 'trees', 'flinging', 'millions', 'little', 'knives', 'once.As', 'source', 'material', '1959', 'novel', 'Koga', 'Ninja', 'Scrolls', 'previously', 'adapted', 'anime', 'series', 'Basilisk', 'was', 'good', 'base', 'using', 'traditional', 'conflict', 'Iga', 'Koga', 'ninja', 'villages', 'Romeo/Juliet', 'love', 'story', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'director', 'sure', 'hammer', 'point', 'home', 'even', 'stating', 'several', 'times', 'two', 'are', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'Director', 'Ten', 'Shimoyama', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'choice', 'having', 'experience', 'Chinese', 'action', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'able', 'supply', 'dramatic', 'action', 'hallmark', 'genre', 'lead', 'actress', 'Yukie', 'Nakama', 'brought', 'star', 'power', 'being', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'actress', 'Japan', 'today', 'were', 'even', 'good', 'enough', 'skirt', 'inability', 'fight', 'Yukie', 'martial', 'arts', 'ability', 'broom', 'stick', 'have', 'awfully', 'pretty', 'face', 'was', 'used', 'full', 'effect.All', 'Shinobi', 'good', 'flick', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'not', 'really', 'experience', 'there', 'part', 'actors', 'director', 'produce', 'really', 'moving', 'martial', 'arts', 'fantasy', 'everyone', 'worked', 'what', 'had', 'keeping', 'action', 'low-key', 'making', 'emotions', 'characters', 'focus', 'basis', 'story', 'Romeo/Juliet', 'conflict', 'nobody', 'really', 'expecting', 'happy', 'ending', 'even', 'mind', 'character', 'deaths', 'have', 'impact', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'everything', 'out', 'exactly', 'expected', 'choices', 'were', 'odd', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'including', 'legendary', 'warriors', 'Hattori', 'Hanzo', 'Jubei', 'Yagyu', 'plot', 'sending', 'battle', 'serve', 'little', 'more', 'recognizable', 'set', 'decoration']",Shinobi - Heart Under Blade
