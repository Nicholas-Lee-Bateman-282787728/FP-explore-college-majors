I couldn't get over it, I LOVE this, I love Wrestlemania, it is bigger than big for us wrestling fans and to have them all with all the classic moments brings me back to when I was a kid watching these matches and wrestlers do what they do best.  Really great.  My only gripe about this, some of the wrestlers entrace music is changed.  Demolition does not have their Search and Destroy song by Rick Derringer but some cheap horror music, Ricky Steamboat instead of eye in the sky has some odd karate music....the fact that they own those songs I dont understand why they changed it....but other than that, this is great!",5,All the best in one package,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,665,"['got', 'Christmas', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'LOVE', 'love', 'Wrestlemania', 'bigger', 'big', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'have', 'classic', 'moments', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', 'matches', 'wrestlers', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'Really', 'great', 'only', 'gripe', 'wrestlers', 'entrace', 'music', 'changed', 'Demolition', 'not', 'have', 'Search', 'Destroy', 'song', 'Rick', 'Derringer', 'cheap', 'horror', 'music', 'Ricky', 'Steamboat', 'instead', 'eye', 'sky', 'odd', 'karate', 'music', 'fact', 'own', 'songs', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'changed', 'other', 'great']",N/A

1101458,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B000VEORTA,MacheteJason,"[3, 3]","WWE fans will appreciate this 22-disc DVD collection of Wrestlemania. All the best moments from 1985-2006 are included. It is a collector's dream containing some classic action from the 1980s through the modern era of wrestling (the first 22 Wrestlemanias are included). All the old greats are here: Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, The Ultimate Warrior and many others. There are smaller versions of this box set in multiple DVD volumes but if you want the complete collection you can't miss this massive set. My only complaint is that not all of the matches are included, some of the trash talking is edited out and various musical entrances are cut. There isn't much in the way of bonus features either. A deluxe Blu-ray release with 3 bonus discs of supplements would rate 5 stars.
