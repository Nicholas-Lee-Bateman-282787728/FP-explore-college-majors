1641486,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00C2535C6,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 6]","I love classic films.  Especially old black `n whites.  I couldn't say why exactly.  I think it's that they're a bit more primal about how they had to approach the filmmaking process.  They didn't have all of the tricks and twists of special effects and fancy-pants editing, so they were largely confined to using dialogue - that great, great form of communication - to convey so very much of the story.  Without good, snappy dialogue, those movies of old were destined to one day end up on the trash heap.  Consequently, I think they produced better screenwriters - folks who had a learned ear for what sounded right, what conveyed the proper sentiment, what captured a precise emotion for their audiences.  Still, it's a shame that more of these `classics' don't get the treatment PERFECT UNDERSTANDING has; it's an impressive discovery, and I can only hope there's more to come from the folks behind the Cohen Film Collection.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Judy Rogers (played by the forever lovely Gloria Swanson) and Nicholas Randall (a young and thin Laurence Olivier) are socialites in love.  However, they see couples all around them mired in one unhappy marriage after another.  Hoping to `buck the trend,' Judy and Nick decide the best they can do to preserve their own relationship magic is to draft a ""marriage agreement,"" one which promises they will never argue, they will always treat one another as lovers, and they will always respect one another's private happiness.  What appears to be a perfect understanding only leads to the discover of one imperfection after another as Nick succumbs to the charms of a former lover (Nora Swinburne) and Judy almost falls into the arms of another (John Halliday).  Can they find happiness again or are they now destined for divorce?Wow.  Talk about a real eye-opener!  PERFECT UNDERSTANDING was way ahead of its time.  In fact, the agreement fashioned by the two lovebirds in the opening could almost be likened to an `open marriage' by contemporary standards.  In fact, his own personal guilt forces Nick to confess, and Judy appears perfectly willing to forgive him; that is until she divulges her marital woes to her old friend, Ivan.  To make matters worse, Judy realizes she's pregnant while it's clear to her that the child belongs to her one and only true love, Nick's suspicions only serve to push the two of them further and further apart.  What's amazing is how open and nonchalant the script by Michael Powell treats all of this, almost as if this were the status quo in marital relationships of the time.  I daresay it wasn't - this was 1933, after all - though Hollywood socialites and debutantes were always `ahead of the curve' when it comes to social mores.  That much hasn't changed.The film is smartly directed from staging to cinematography by Cyril Gardner.  Gardner made impressive use of some vast interior sets, and he moved the plot along briskly by making extensive use of some rather elaborate video montages to establish the passage of time as well as the build-up of marital tension.  Also, it's exciting to see Olivier so fresh and new in his career (promotional materials provided to me with the release point out he was only but a few years along in film); and, even at this ripe age, he was a master at the witty banter establishing the high points of his love with Judy (Swanson).  The two of them handle both ends of the scale with great skill - the first half is punctuated by their constant repartee while the latter half is richly nuanced with desperate, longing expressions of their mutual torture.Billed largely as a ""comedy of manners,"" UNDERSTANDING may not be PERFECT, but it's pretty darn close, and it's pretty darn impressive.PERFECT UNDERSTANDING was produced by Gloria Swanson British Productions (the only film she made in Britain).  DVD distribution is being handled through Cohen Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds very solid - be aware this is a (standard) two-track audio, and there's some marked gaps in quality in the first fifteen minutes or so, but it clears up as the film progresses.  The Blu-ray release is blessed with two selected shorts from the era (two Mack Sennett shorts ""Husband's Reunion"" and ""Dream Stuff"").HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Given the era, it's certainly an exercise in some curious morality.  PERFECT UNDERSTANDING is a wonderful find from Cohen - this is its Blu-ray and DVD debut.  It's been longingly restored for this release, and who wouldn't want to experience this Gloria Swanson/Laurence Olivier rom-com now that it's available?  The script captures the marked trend of the time - to propel the narrative through the use of clever dialogue - and it's brilliantly delivered by two masters of the craft.  I'll admit it dragged a bit for me in the last fifteen minutes - that's when the marriage is coming apart - but rest assured there will be a happy ending for those who work for it most ... just like in life!In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Cohen Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of PERFECT UNDERSTANDING by request for the expressed

1641488,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C2535C6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 9]","As a classic film enthusiast, I was somewhat surprised that I'd never even heard of the 1933 Ealing Studio release ""Perfect Understanding."" Not only does it carry the Ealing brand, it boasts a screenplay by the great Michael Powell and lead performances from Laurence Olivier and Gloria Swanson. Heck, that's all I need to know! Sign me up. Billed as a romantic comedy, I'm not sure the movie entirely succeeds under this description. With aspects that veer from slapstick to complete melodrama, the tone of ""Perfect Understanding"" veers all over the place. An unconventional domestic drama centered around infidelity (both imagined and real), there are some aspects of the movie that play deadly serious. These moments are (for my taste) the strongest in the film. When it plays for a lighter appeal, the manic energy can feel somewhat overdone and chaotic. At times, it seems as if two different movies are competing against one another. But despite these reservations, it's still a easy recommendation for fans of Olivier and Swanson! They make the picture worth a look!Swanson and Olivier play a young society couple who don't want to fall into the same trap as their other married friends. They want a marriage in which they can retain their independence without all the baggage of traditional domesticity. It's a fine arrangement (a perfect understanding, if you will) in theory, but somewhat harder in practice. After a blissful honeymoon, the couple separate at the end of their vacation. With Olivier enjoying the festivities of Cannes, his old circle of friends and a former flame end up sharing time with the new groom. Can he withstand the temptation of another woman? Coincidentally, Swanson also has another suitor on the home front. When the couple reunite, how much honesty can their relationship bear? Between real offenses and certain misconceptions, this marital experiment seems doomed to failure. Can love prevail? Should it?I really liked Swanson and Olivier together. Swanson was trying to establish herself in the talkies after being a silent screen star and she even produced this movie (the only film she ever made in Britain). Olivier was a stage star (a trained Shakespearean actor) newly into a film career. They have an easy chemistry and charm to spare. If you know them primarily from their later works, this more lightweight piece is an interesting counterpoint. Olivier, in particular, is downright dashing! I don't think ""Perfect Understanding"" is an essential classic, by any means, but it is definitely worth a look. The early scenes are especially jumbled with dozens of characters and relationships thrown at you rather haphazardly. Things start to settle, however, once we leave this extended opening. Again, I probably wouldn't classify this as romantic comedy (although some might). To me, it's more of a relationship drama with some lighter moments.

The contract states that ""Never to be husband and wife, but lover and mistress and above everything else, to remain individual."" But this agreement does not stand the test of time. When Nicholas Randall (Laurence Olivier) is vacationing alone in Cannes, France  cheats on his wife Judy (Gloria Swanson) and later begs for forgiveness. The divorce case heads to the court and there the drama ends in much unexpected way. Judy agrees to forgive Nicholas and they elope from the court proceedings. The court has no choice but to dismiss the case and it all ends in a very happy note.For most silent movie buffs like me, it is refreshing to watch this movie, since Gloria Swanson made very few talkie movies. The most striking feature of the movie is Swanson working with Laurence Olivier who was eight years younger than her; brings me the memory of Sunset Boulevard where she also romances a much younger man in William Holden.  She told her friends that she was deeply attracted to the charm of Olivier while making this movie. At that time Swanson was living in London; Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., had suggested that she start her own studio to surmount her financial difficulties. This movie was tightly budgeted but later became every expensive since Olivier had to miss shootings because of an auto accident not related to the  movie; Swanson had to cancel few days because she had flu; and then  the studio where the film was being developed, caught fire and the film was destroyed. They had to recreate with whatever was left in a studio in United States. It became so expensive Swanson had to sell her stocks in ""United Artists"" Company.The boat race in Cannes, France is fun part of the movie, and Swanson does a splendid job as Judy Rogers. This love story reminds me of Love Story (1964) in many ways; for one, young Laurence Olivier bears strong resemblance to Ryan O'Neal.
