But when you think about it they did it this way because they know NO one was going to buy Big Mommas house-2...because it was GARBAGE!!,5,Great Movie!,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,271,"['Big', 'Mommas', 'house', 'part', '1', 'great', 'movie', 'best', 'pack', 'However', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'paut', 'movies', 'together', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'when', 'think', 'did', 'way', 'know', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'buy', 'Big', 'Mommas', 'house-2', 'was', 'GARBAGE']",Big Momma's House 1 & 2
1405226,A3RBKW9NKA2GRE,B004FPE43K,Sabooski the Cat,"[3, 3]","Several male comedians' have (in the movies) a character best described as their ""alter-ego', ie: a character of the opposite sex engaged in an adventure of some sort or another.Back in the day Flip Wilson had 'Geraldine', then Eddie Murphy with his (I forgot the name) and of course Tyler Perry's 'Medea'.Well, Martin Laurence has 'Big Momma'. As far as my tastes go Big Momma is the best! She's sweet, funny, really not gross at all (as these characters' are wont to get, well there are a few, er, moments). Something about the way Martin Laurence executes his character is pleasing...and funny! No F-bombs, just a tad innuendo (ie: a wink wink to the camera) to remind the viewer that it is a male character playing a female role.Big Momma #1 and Big Momma #2 are great as a set. Big Momma is not a one-trick-pony. The character has depth (to a degree) and the movies' are family friendly, crazy, and good for more than a few gut busting laughs!I do think Big Momma #1 is the better of the two. Big Momma #2 is kinda like a re-do of #1 and drags abit. Big Momma's House #1 is ****, Big Momma's House #2 is **1/2. Average it out to @ ***1/2 for the set.",3,Big Momma know what she talkin about!  3.5 stars,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1155,"['Several', 'male', 'comedians', 'have', 'movies', 'character', 'best', 'described', 'alter-ego', 'ie', 'character', 'opposite', 'sex', 'engaged', 'adventure', 'sort', 'another.Back', 'day', 'Flip', 'Wilson', 'had', ""'Geraldine"", 'then', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'forgot', 'name', 'course', 'Tyler', 'Perry', ""'Medea'.Well"", 'Martin', 'Laurence', ""'Big"", 'Momma', 'far', 'tastes', 'go', 'Big', 'Momma', 'best', 'sweet', 'funny', 'really', 'not', 'gross', 'characters', 'are', 'wont', 'get', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'er', 'moments', 'Something', 'way', 'Martin', 'Laurence', 'character', 'pleasing', 'funny', 'F-bombs', 'just', 'tad', 'innuendo', 'ie', 'wink', 'wink', 'camera', 'remind', 'viewer', 'male', 'character', 'playing', 'female', 'role.Big', 'Momma', '1', 'Big', 'Momma', '2', 'are', 'great', 'set', 'Big', 'Momma', 'not', 'one-trick-pony', 'character', 'depth', 'degree', 'movies', 'are', 'family', 'friendly', 'crazy', 'good', 'more', 'few', 'gut', 'busting', 'do', 'think', 'Big', 'Momma', '1', 'better', 'two', 'Big', 'Momma', '2', 'kinda', 're-do', '1', 'drags', 'abit', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', '1', '****', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', '2', '**1/2', 'Average', 'out', '@', '***1/2', 'set']",Big Momma's House 1 & 2
