1405163,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B004FM2F5C,Israel Drazin,"[5, 6]","""The Imposter"" is an easy to view, fun film about a meek, nave, and somewhat foolish peddler, who frightens easily, who finds a dead man and his horse outside of town in the Old West. The horse had apparently bolted when it saw or heard a rattlesnake, and the man fell off and broke his neck. The man was carrying a letter that offered him a job for $25 a month, much more money than the peddler ever made. There is no indication what the job is. The man was wearing a beautiful gun. The peddler decides to take his place. He arrives in town saying he is the hired man and finds out that he, a meek and oft-frightened man, has been hired as the town marshal.Viewers will enjoy seeing how he handles his job. He faces gun fighters and brawlers. He has dealings with a prostitute and naively thinks she is a ""nice"" woman, and she turns out to be nice. His deputy forces people to pay protection money and he needs to deal with this. He discovers that the casino owner is rigging his tables. He needs to stop a bank robber who is racing out of town and has to deal with his deputy and the casino owner who try to ambush and kill him. All this and he can't shoot the dead man's fancy gun.",5,"""The Imposter,"" part of the series, is delightful",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,1184,"['Imposter', 'easy', 'view', 'fun', 'film', 'meek', 'nave', 'somewhat', 'foolish', 'peddler', 'who', 'easily', 'who', 'dead', 'man', 'horse', 'town', 'Old', 'West', 'horse', 'had', 'apparently', 'bolted', 'when', 'saw', 'heard', 'rattlesnake', 'man', 'fell', 'off', 'broke', 'neck', 'man', 'was', 'carrying', 'letter', 'offered', 'job', '25', 'month', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'peddler', 'ever', 'made', 'indication', 'what', 'job', 'man', 'was', 'wearing', 'beautiful', 'gun', 'peddler', 'take', 'place', 'town', 'saying', 'hired', 'man', 'out', 'meek', 'oft-frightened', 'man', 'been', 'hired', 'town', 'marshal.Viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'job', 'gun', 'fighters', 'brawlers', 'dealings', 'prostitute', 'naively', 'nice', 'woman', 'out', 'be', 'nice', 'deputy', 'forces', 'people', 'pay', 'protection', 'money', 'deal', 'casino', 'owner', 'rigging', 'tables', 'stop', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'racing', 'town', 'deal', 'deputy', 'casino', 'owner', 'who', 'try', 'ambush', 'kill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'dead', 'man', 'fancy', 'gun']",N/A

1405165,AFV2584U13XP3,B004FM2F5C,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 2]",I still find many of these episodes to be highly entertaining as I tried to watch the episodes weekly at the same time as when Stargate Sg1 and Outer Limits was playing on Showtime and while the series sadly lasted only two seasons for the price these two sets are going for it's definitely a real bargain. The series put in a mixtures of gritty western style storyline sometimes mixed with a drop or two of the supernatural which added to the enjoyment of the series. While some of the guest cast might seem unknown today as some have faded out of the Hollywood spotlight or were not American but Canadian actors/actresses their performances were still done very well.  The video quality is pretty good while there is some graininess is some scenes overall the picture quality is pretty sharp and clear.
