1132835,A9O3K8CWZ3M4Z,B0011UO8ZQ,"Mark Anthony Craig ""Marcus Anton""","[31, 32]","As many of the reviewers have already said, why won't Sony release any further seasons of Hart to Hart?I'll tell you why.  It's because the DVD industry is now run by 20-30 year olds who seem to think that: (1) nobody over the age of 35 exists; (2) anyone who IS over the age of 35 can't work a DVD player; (3) why would anyone be interested in anything made prior to the year 2000?; (4) why would anyone watch a series with no preening blonde 20 something who spends every episode worrying about whether the hero will still fancy her by the time credits roll; (5) why are there no zombies/vampires/CGI in at least one episode of the run?; (6) why should a series with the main stars being over the age of 30 have any appeal to anyone? (7) the only reason anyone would want to buy a dusty old 1980s series on dvd is if someone's about to mount a remake film or tv series so that anyone under the age of 30 where the Harts would most likely be 20-something lottery-millionaire/X Factor winners who ""made it big"", and viewers will seek out the 80s version purely out of curiosity [and YouTube has probably gone into meltdown].The evidence?  Just look at what happened to the tv series ""Fame"".  DVD is hungry to release FILMS, so they release the original 1980 version.  oooo! someone asks about the tv series, so season 1 comes out.  Years go by - no sign of any more until ..... a remake of the film filled with the latest crop of teens and 20 somethings.  Yayyy!!  Season 2 of the tv series gets released.  And then what????  NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!  We might get season 3 in about 25 years time when ANOTHER remake of ""Fame"" comes out.Sony is sitting on a vast mountain of excellent tv material, a lot of which is far superior to the image-conscious, shallow rubbish that passes for much of today's television output (some good series excepted, there are a few, but NOT ENOUGH!).Sony needs to review its employment policy and put some of us 40/50 somethings in charge of the archive-to-dvd department.  Then we'll show today's teens what QUALITY TELEVISION was all about in our youth.Sony (and MGM) tv execs should hang their heads in shame.",5,Don't hold your breath!!!!,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,2138,"['many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Sony', 'release', 'further', 'seasons', 'Hart', 'Hart', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'DVD', 'industry', 'now', 'run', '20-30', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'seem', 'think', '1', 'nobody', 'age', '35', 'exists', '2', 'anyone', 'who', 'age', '35', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'DVD', 'player', '3', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'be', 'interested', 'anything', 'made', 'prior', 'year', '2000', '4', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'watch', 'series', 'preening', 'blonde', '20', 'something', 'who', 'episode', 'worrying', 'hero', 'will', 'still', 'fancy', 'time', 'roll', '5', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'zombies/vampires/CGI', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'run', '6', 'why', 'should', 'series', 'main', 'stars', 'being', 'age', '30', 'have', 'appeal', 'anyone', '7', 'only', 'reason', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'buy', 'dusty', 'old', '1980s', 'series', 'dvd', 'someone', 'mount', 'remake', 'film', 'tv', 'series', 'anyone', 'age', '30', 'where', 'Harts', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', '20-something', 'lottery-millionaire/X', 'Factor', 'winners', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'viewers', 'will', 'seek', 'out', '80s', 'version', 'purely', 'curiosity', '[', 'YouTube', 'probably', 'gone', 'meltdown', ']', '.The', 'evidence', 'Just', 'look', 'what', 'happened', 'tv', 'series', 'Fame', 'DVD', 'hungry', 'release', 'FILMS', 'release', 'original', '1980', 'version', 'oooo', 'someone', 'tv', 'series', 'season', '1', 'out', 'Years', 'go', 'sign', 'more', 'remake', 'film', 'filled', 'latest', 'crop', 'teens', '20', 'somethings', 'Yayyy', 'Season', '2', 'tv', 'series', 'released', 'then', 'what', 'NOTHING', 'might', 'get', 'season', '3', 'about', '25', 'years', 'time', 'when', 'ANOTHER', 'remake', 'Fame', 'out.Sony', 'sitting', 'vast', 'mountain', 'excellent', 'tv', 'material', 'lot', 'far', 'superior', 'image-conscious', 'shallow', 'rubbish', 'much', 'today', 'television', 'output', 'good', 'series', 'excepted', 'are', 'few', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', '.Sony', 'needs', 'review', 'employment', 'policy', 'put', '40/50', 'somethings', 'charge', 'archive-to-dvd', 'department', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'show', 'today', 'teens', 'what', 'QUALITY', 'TELEVISION', 'was', 'youth.Sony', 'MGM', 'tv', 'execs', 'should', 'hang', 'heads', 'shame']",Hart to Hart: Season 3
