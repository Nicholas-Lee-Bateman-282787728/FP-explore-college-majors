1423763,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004PQWHOW,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[5, 5]","Lorenzo (Gary Moore) is a tough/successful collection agent. He's also on the lam being personally in deep debt, and currently in Norfolk, VA. He is threatened by `Uncle' Frankie (Danny Trejo) whom is owed thousands. The crime boss's nephew thug Omar (David Krusen) is assigned duty to keep an eye, or kill if necessary. Lorenzo comes up with a plan to use a local street aid mission (LEC) people to get the thousands needed for his own life saving benefit. From there it gets comic. Really.Omar finds faith's salvation through Jesus preached at the mission. A plan proves that Lorenzo is truly a louse as lousy as they come. He collects funds in cash in amounts less than half below the company's goal keeping it for himself--even gambling with it. But just when Lorenzo thinks he's free it gets worse. The humor quickly adjusts to second chances and hope for others, including a homeless mission guy drunk, former aide to Bush the father, played by Christobal Krusen, who also manages to write, direct, and produce.Multiple roles are common in these low-budget faith based films. I like to review them for what they are, a film as a mission, with a message. This DVD is Dove Approved, but does have some violence scenes. I was pleasantly surprised, as was my wife. A message to goodness and hope but light on the preaching. It's not high dollar Hollywood, not professing to be, but gets an entertainment job done well, and more. It's a mix of new and seasoned cast. Hollywood could not do this on the same budget, I suspect. The story was inspired in part by the real LEC -Life Enrichment Center of Norfolk.There is CC and Subtitles but they seem to lag behind the scene. Maybe too much for those who truly can't hear. Other bonus includes 3 behind the scenes segments: 4 min of cast/crew commentary; 2 min of the shoot out scene; and 3 min of a dock scene. 7 advertising trailers are also included.",5,A thug and con story you laugh through to the good end,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,1901,"['Lorenzo', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'tough/successful', 'collection', 'agent', 'also', 'lam', 'being', 'personally', 'deep', 'debt', 'currently', 'Norfolk', 'VA', 'threatened', 'Uncle', 'Frankie', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'whom', 'owed', 'thousands', 'crime', 'boss', 'nephew', 'thug', 'Omar', 'David', 'Krusen', 'assigned', 'duty', 'keep', 'eye', 'kill', 'necessary', 'Lorenzo', 'up', 'plan', 'use', 'local', 'street', 'aid', 'mission', 'LEC', 'people', 'get', 'thousands', 'needed', 'own', 'life', 'saving', 'benefit', 'comic', 'Really.Omar', 'faith', 'salvation', 'Jesus', 'preached', 'mission', 'plan', 'Lorenzo', 'truly', 'louse', 'as', 'lousy', 'come', 'funds', 'cash', 'amounts', 'less', 'half', 'company', 'goal', 'keeping', 'even', 'gambling', 'just', 'when', 'Lorenzo', 'free', 'worse', 'humor', 'quickly', 'second', 'chances', 'hope', 'others', 'including', 'homeless', 'mission', 'guy', 'drunk', 'former', 'aide', 'Bush', 'father', 'played', 'Christobal', 'Krusen', 'who', 'also', 'write', 'direct', 'produce.Multiple', 'roles', 'are', 'common', 'low-budget', 'faith', 'based', 'films', 'like', 'review', 'what', 'are', 'film', 'mission', 'message', 'DVD', 'Dove', 'Approved', 'have', 'violence', 'scenes', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'wife', 'message', 'goodness', 'hope', 'light', 'preaching', 'not', 'high', 'dollar', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'professing', 'be', 'entertainment', 'job', 'done', 'well', 'more', 'mix', 'new', 'seasoned', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'same', 'budget', 'suspect', 'story', 'was', 'inspired', 'part', 'real', 'LEC', '-Life', 'Enrichment', 'Center', 'Norfolk.There', 'CC', 'Subtitles', 'seem', 'lag', 'scene', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'who', 'truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Other', 'bonus', '3', 'scenes', 'segments', '4', 'min', 'cast/crew', 'commentary', '2', 'min', 'shoot', 'scene', '3', 'min', 'dock', 'scene', '7', 'advertising', 'trailers', 'are', 'also', 'included']",N/A

1423766,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B004PQWHOW,Trejofan,"[0, 0]","This was a very cute movie. However, there was more than one &#34;debt collector&#34; in this movie.  Both the Hero and Uncle Frankie are debt collectors, although the hero does his debt collecting through a collection agency, and Uncle Frankie does it with threats of violence and muscle. Yes the &#34;hero&#34; isn't much of a hero because he is running away from &#34;Uncle Frankie&#34; a loan shark played by Mr. Trejo. Even though the hero engineers a scheme to pay off his debt, he ends up helping numerous down on their luck people, including having a positive influence on Uncle Frankie's &#34;muscle&#34;, &#34;Omar.&#34; The movie has a lot of very funny situations.  Now for the majestic Mr. Trejo: Not only does he play a slightly comedic part, he gets to dress in expensive suits with his lovely long shiny hair pulled back or hanging freely. My favorite scene was at a poker table with Mr. Trejo dressed in a red suit with a red fedora and his beautiful shiny long hair hanging freely about his shoulders!  This man should take on a modeling career  but I don't know how he'd fit it in with all the time he donates and spends working.  I'd take him either dressed to the nines as he is in this movie, or slightly undressed as we've seen in so many of his other appearances.  This was a good movie with very little violence and gun play.",5,Danny Trejo cleans up extremely well,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1350,"['was', 'very', 'cute', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'more', 'one', '34', 'debt', 'collector', '34', 'movie', 'Hero', 'Uncle', 'Frankie', 'are', 'debt', 'collectors', 'hero', 'debt', 'collecting', 'collection', 'agency', 'Uncle', 'Frankie', 'threats', 'violence', 'muscle', 'Yes', '34', 'hero', '34', ""n't"", 'much', 'hero', 'running', 'away', '34', 'Uncle', 'Frankie', '34', 'loan', 'shark', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'Even', 'hero', 'scheme', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'up', 'helping', 'numerous', 'down', 'luck', 'people', 'including', 'having', 'positive', 'influence', 'Uncle', 'Frankie', '34', 'muscle', '34', '34', 'Omar.', '34', 'movie', 'lot', 'very', 'funny', 'situations', 'Now', 'majestic', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'Not', 'only', 'play', 'slightly', 'comedic', 'part', 'dress', 'expensive', 'suits', 'lovely', 'long', 'shiny', 'hair', 'pulled', 'back', 'hanging', 'freely', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'poker', 'table', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'dressed', 'red', 'suit', 'red', 'fedora', 'beautiful', 'shiny', 'long', 'hair', 'hanging', 'freely', 'shoulders', 'man', 'should', 'take', 'modeling', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'d"", 'fit', 'time', 'working', ""'d"", 'take', 'either', 'dressed', 'nines', 'movie', 'slightly', 'undressed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'appearances', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'gun', 'play']",N/A
