Smith ""Cher Smith""","[0, 0]","I am a first time grandmother but I never dreamed my 4 1/2 month old granddaughter would care to watch any children's programs. She is much too young, right? Wrong! One day by accident I was clicking through the channels while holding her and Yo gabba gabba was on. She went wild. Her legs and arms stiffened with excitement and she smiled from ear to ear. Then she wiggled and jumped and remained glued to the TV screen until the end of the show. I attempted to interest her in other programs for kids, but they bored her quickly. She is now nearly 6 months old and Yo Gabba Gabba is number one with her. It never fails to excite her as it did the very first time she watched it. Now she laughs out loud. I have been pleased with the quailty of the DVD's and fast shipping. I just get a kick out of watching her watch the show, not to mention some of the good things taught on the program such as respect for others and sharing. Toss in exercise and you are teaching you child good values and how to stay healthy by keeping active.",5,Yahoo for Gabba Gabba,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1032,"['am', 'first', 'time', 'grandmother', 'never', 'dreamed', '4', '1/2', 'month', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'would', 'care', 'watch', 'children', 'programs', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'right', 'Wrong', 'One', 'day', 'accident', 'was', 'clicking', 'channels', 'holding', 'Yo', 'gabba', 'gabba', 'was', 'went', 'wild', 'legs', 'arms', 'stiffened', 'excitement', 'smiled', 'ear', 'ear', 'Then', 'wiggled', 'jumped', 'remained', 'glued', 'TV', 'screen', 'end', 'show', 'attempted', 'interest', 'other', 'programs', 'kids', 'bored', 'quickly', 'now', 'nearly', '6', 'months', 'old', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'number', 'one', 'never', 'excite', 'did', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Now', 'out', 'loud', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'quailty', 'DVD', 'fast', 'shipping', 'just', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'mention', 'good', 'things', 'taught', 'program', 'such', 'respect', 'others', 'sharing', 'Toss', 'exercise', 'are', 'teaching', 'child', 'good', 'values', 'how', 'stay', 'healthy', 'keeping', 'active']",Yo Gabba Gabba!: The Dancey Dance Bunch

(I ordered 3 Yo Gabba Gabba Videos at one time.) They came crammed in a box that was too small and the edge of the dvd cases on top and bottom were crushed. The cases are those new eco kind that are flimsy. But it doesn't matter really to me that isn't why I bought them, I bought them for the show on the dvd (which was fine) and the show is great! My son loves Yo Gabba Gabba and his eyes were glued to the screen and he was bouncing around as soon as it started playing. This is a great show because our son likes it and daddy and I get the songs stuck in our head but they are not as bad as other shows. This is one of the best toddler shows I think ever made and I even find a new episode interesting. Great music, musicians and art. A wide variety of popular and current bands and artist make guest appearances and the artist, Mark is the guy from the band Devo (Whip It!).

Anyone that has seen the show knows just how infectious the songs are, how cute the characters are and what fun the show is. All the children in my family ranging from two to seven lose their minds when this show comes on. The kids know all the words and they love when it's time to dance.DJ Lance Rock and his crew of friends always have good lessons to share and the music is incredibly infectious. The online buzz about the show is massive and everyone seems to like it. I've been noticing a slow build up of merchandise in the stores connected with the show and I imagine post-Christmas, Yo Gabba Gabba! will probably be the biggest children's show on the planet without doubt.Nickelodeon is heavily pushing this show, Wow Wow Wubzy and Little Bill. All these shows are much better than the shows that were available when I was a kid, and they're all award-winning. I let my son watch a two/three hours of TV everyday and I'm thankful that he gets to watch this show, commercial free, either on Noggin or on DVD. Well done.The episodes on the disk are as follows:1.Friends2.Eat3.Dance4.HappyThese are some great episodes from the show and I'll definitely look for another volume when it comes out.
