922115,AINK9HMV5GVHA,B000A5SR46,Anna Damos,"[0, 1]","I loved watching this on video every year. I would watch it at least twice a year. I wanted to buy it on DVD a long time ago, but it was over 50 dollars. I'm just so happy to find out that it's coming out on DVD for less than 20 dollars. Not that I didn't like the video, but the video looks like it might not make it. That's why I only watch it twice a year on video, so it doesn't ware out. I've always loved this show. I love the songs in this Cinderella more than the ones on the cartoon Cinderella. If you've never seen this movie, you should buy this movie, when it comes out.",5,I'm so happy to get this on DVD!,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,582,"['loved', 'watching', 'video', 'year', 'would', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'year', 'wanted', 'buy', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'over', '50', 'dollars', ""'m"", 'just', 'so', 'happy', 'find', 'out', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'less', '20', 'dollars', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'video', 'video', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'why', 'only', 'watch', 'twice', 'year', 'video', ""n't"", 'ware', 'out', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'show', 'love', 'songs', 'Cinderella', 'more', 'ones', 'cartoon', 'Cinderella', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'when', 'out']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella

922118,ALD1CRUBY1365,B000A5SR46,R. L. MILLER,"[0, 1]","I originally watched this when I was a teenager--the market they brought in Lesley Warren for. Stuart Damon as Prince Charming seems a bit old for Warren, though. Maybe late 20's to her 18-or-so. No overhype of the ""wicked stepmother"", which the Disney version tried to make as scary as Oz's Wicked Witch (""Malificent"", who I see has been given a spinoff of her own recently, half a century later). Just a second wife who didn't get along well with her husband's kids from the previous marriage and being a bit rhymes-with-itchy towards them. I was able to relate to that--back then my own father had recently remarried and us kids couldn't stand her. It was good to see a fairy tale that didn't make the good guys goody-goody and the bad guys nearly satanic. But maybe that's a fringe benefit of a version that targets a market not necessarily limited to little kids.Good music too, which was always a ""no kidding Sherlock"" with Rodgers & Hammerstein. I had been trying for years to remember where the song came from which had the lines; ""Do I love you because you're wonderful...or are you wonderful because I love you"". And sure enough, it was from this show. As are classics like the amusingly ""meow-esque"" duet ""A Girl Like That"" between the stepsisters, and of course the wistful solo ""My Own Little Corner"" which is the ""big hit"" of this show--the lament of a girl maintaining a low profile in a dysfunctional family.",5,Finally,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1424,"['originally', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'market', 'brought', 'Lesley', 'Warren', 'Stuart', 'Damon', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'bit', 'old', 'Warren', 'though', 'Maybe', 'late', '20', '18-or-so', 'overhype', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'Disney', 'version', 'tried', 'make', 'as', 'scary', 'Oz', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Malificent', 'who', 'see', 'been', 'given', 'spinoff', 'own', 'recently', 'century', 'later', 'Just', 'second', 'wife', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'husband', 'kids', 'previous', 'marriage', 'being', 'bit', 'rhymes-with-itchy', 'towards', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'back', 'then', 'own', 'father', 'had', 'recently', 'remarried', 'kids', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'fairy', 'tale', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'guys', 'goody-goody', 'bad', 'guys', 'nearly', 'satanic', 'maybe', 'fringe', 'benefit', 'version', 'market', 'not', 'necessarily', 'limited', 'little', 'kids.Good', 'music', 'too', 'was', 'always', 'kidding', 'Sherlock', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'years', 'remember', 'where', 'song', 'came', 'had', 'lines', 'Do', 'love', ""'re"", 'wonderful', 'are', 'wonderful', 'love', 'sure', 'enough', 'was', 'show', 'are', 'classics', 'amusingly', 'meow-esque', 'duet', 'Girl', 'stepsisters', 'course', 'wistful', 'solo', 'Own', 'Little', 'Corner', 'big', 'hit', 'show', 'lament', 'girl', 'maintaining', 'low', 'profile', 'dysfunctional', 'family']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella
