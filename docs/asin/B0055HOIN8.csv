But, unfortunately, that is the only thing that could possibly make this movie of any interest. The script, acting, and direction are pretty dull. The pace is very slow, yet the film is only 67 minutes. That is not good. I'd say that this is worth seeing only for those that want to see some male nudity from ""average"" guys.",2,"Good Nudity, But Little Else Worth Mentioning",1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,442,"['Blackmail', 'Boys', 'gay-themed', 'drama', 'get', 'see', 'inch', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'including', 'erections', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'movie', 'interest', 'script', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'pretty', 'dull', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'yet', 'film', 'only', '67', 'minutes', 'not', 'good', ""'d"", 'say', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'male', 'nudity', 'average', 'guys']",N/A

There was an interesting plot here, but the movie has a ""homemade"" video feel to it that is part of the plot.  There should have been consequences here, but the makers of the movie went for a happily ever after style.  The plot wasn't logical.  The characters aren't likeable, just plain.  For a movie that showed us about doing wrong, it chose to tell us what they did right at the end.  I was so disappointed with the movie that had I been a producer of this movie, I would have worked in an ending that included everyone dying.  That is how bad this movie is, just plain awful.",1,Disappointment,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,636,"['had', 'been', 'forewarned', 'had', 'see', 'was', 'interesting', 'plot', 'here', 'movie', 'homemade', 'video', 'feel', 'part', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'consequences', 'here', 'makers', 'movie', 'went', 'happily', 'ever', 'style', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'logical', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'just', 'plain', 'movie', 'showed', 'doing', 'wrong', 'chose', 'tell', 'what', 'did', 'right', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'producer', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'ending', 'included', 'everyone', 'dying', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'awful']",N/A

The sex is very very mild  and only in a few scenes. A brief scene of an  erection  is the only  bit of  strong sex otherwise it is tame stuff.The worst aspect of the film is the dreadful shakey hand held camera.Can't the  photographer  learn how to film without  ruining the film. If you like seeing a film with many scenes shot as though there was an earthquake going on, then you will  like the  film.Would have given the film a higher rating if the camera  wasn't shaking a lot. - ruind the film for me.Very amateurish filming.",1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,618,"['film', 'watchable', 'not', 'buy', 'want', 'resell', 'watching', 'sex', 'very', 'very', 'mild', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'brief', 'scene', 'erection', 'only', 'bit', 'strong', 'sex', 'tame', 'stuff.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'film', 'dreadful', 'shakey', 'hand', 'held', 'camera.Ca', ""n't"", 'photographer', 'learn', 'how', 'film', 'ruining', 'film', 'like', 'seeing', 'film', 'many', 'scenes', 'shot', 'was', 'earthquake', 'going', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'film.Would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'higher', 'rating', 'camera', 'was', ""n't"", 'shaking', 'lot', 'ruind', 'film', 'me.Very', 'amateurish', 'filming']",N/A

1442923,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0055HOIN8,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[9, 9]","This is another film from the Shumanski brothers, the makers of `Wrecked'Wrecked. Now if you thought that was good you may find some merit in this their latest offering. It stars Nathan Adloff and Joe Swanberg  who play boyfriends separated by college but still trying to make it work Aaron finally visits Sam in Chicago and finds that he is turning tricks for money. After Sam came out to his parents he was cast adrift from them , leaving him to fend for himself. He is trying to pay his way through art school. Aaron has a supportive family, yet we don't see any offers of fiscal help coming from him - despite the fact they want to get married.They decide to blackmail one of Sam's clients after they discover he is not at all what he has claimed to be with Sam. There is a bit of morality tussling around the blackmail thing, but they seem to decide that two wrongs can sometimes make a right, but without actually articulating as much. So they set about doing the filming (on a mobile phone!) and then go about executing their plan.It is filmed using hand held not so steady cam, and this gives it that fly on the wall feel. Add to that, the pieces to camera from Sam which are done in an interview style, this then has a feeling of docudrama. The soundtrack is not too bad and the use of real as to opposed studio locations I liked, but this was clearly done on a cost saving basis rather than an artistic one.There are scenes of drug taking, various depictions of sex and one or two `old chap' shots, if you follow. It is not the full on `sexy' roller coaster that the sleeve sort of hints at though. There is a bit of on screen chemistry between Aaron and Sam, but not enough to carry what is in essence a rather thin plot. At 69 minutes long this is a short film, and with some slow scenes possibly could have been shorter. That said you do get interminable trailers for more TLA releases so that takes it up to the two hour mark but in an altogether disagreeable way. Still a reasonable effort but it is just OK and by no means one to watch a second time.",3,"Some Boys, a Blackmail and a Smattering of 'Plot'.",1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,2066,"['film', 'Shumanski', 'brothers', 'makers', ""Wrecked'Wrecked"", 'Now', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'may', 'find', 'merit', 'latest', 'offering', 'Nathan', 'Adloff', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'who', 'play', 'boyfriends', 'separated', 'college', 'still', 'trying', 'make', 'work', 'Aaron', 'finally', 'Sam', 'Chicago', 'turning', 'tricks', 'money', 'Sam', 'came', 'out', 'parents', 'was', 'cast', 'adrift', 'leaving', 'fend', 'trying', 'pay', 'way', 'art', 'school', 'Aaron', 'supportive', 'family', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'offers', 'fiscal', 'help', 'coming', 'fact', 'want', 'get', 'married.They', 'decide', 'blackmail', 'one', 'Sam', 'clients', 'discover', 'not', 'what', 'claimed', 'be', 'Sam', 'bit', 'morality', 'tussling', 'blackmail', 'thing', 'seem', 'decide', 'two', 'wrongs', 'can', 'sometimes', 'make', 'right', 'actually', 'articulating', 'much', 'set', 'doing', 'filming', 'mobile', 'phone', 'then', 'go', 'executing', 'plan.It', 'filmed', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'not', 'so', 'steady', 'cam', 'wall', 'feel', 'Add', 'pieces', 'camera', 'Sam', 'are', 'done', 'interview', 'style', 'then', 'feeling', 'docudrama', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'use', 'real', 'opposed', 'studio', 'locations', 'liked', 'was', 'clearly', 'done', 'cost', 'saving', 'basis', 'rather', 'artistic', 'one.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'drug', 'taking', 'various', 'depictions', 'sex', 'one', 'two', 'old', 'chap', 'shots', 'follow', 'not', 'full', 'sexy', 'roller', 'coaster', 'sleeve', 'sort', 'hints', 'bit', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Aaron', 'Sam', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'what', 'essence', 'rather', 'thin', 'plot', '69', 'minutes', 'long', 'short', 'film', 'slow', 'scenes', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shorter', 'said', 'do', 'get', 'interminable', 'trailers', 'more', 'TLA', 'releases', 'so', 'up', 'two', 'hour', 'mark', 'altogether', 'disagreeable', 'way', 'Still', 'reasonable', 'effort', 'just', 'OK', 'means', 'one', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",N/A
