I always remember the  gangs  miss calculations for a problem that arose yet they always solved the problem and came out the winner.  the gang is always suspected of the problem.  great teenage trouble causers, trouble solvers.  from the the 40's and for many years.  great stuff!  i like danny in the series. Also the character danny actually, did serve the usa in world war 2. an episode in this compilation. as he says goodbye to the gang is fantastic.",5,east side kids (bowery boys),1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,519,"['Saturday', 'mornings', 'local', 'station', 'played', 'bowery', 'boys', 'always', 'remember', 'gangs', 'miss', 'calculations', 'problem', 'arose', 'yet', 'always', 'solved', 'problem', 'came', 'out', 'winner', 'gang', 'always', 'suspected', 'problem', 'great', 'teenage', 'trouble', 'causers', 'trouble', 'solvers', '40', 'many', 'years', 'great', 'stuff', 'i', 'danny', 'series', 'Also', 'character', 'danny', 'actually', 'did', 'serve', 'usa', 'world', 'war', '2.', 'episode', 'compilation', 'goodbye', 'gang', 'fantastic']",Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids Collection

Cheap is in both senses.I had already collected a set of Alpha Video and Platinum Disc Corporation editions but had hoped to find editions with better picture and sound quality.  Passport didn't do it.Only occasionally would the quality even equal that of Alpha or Platinum.  Usually the quality was markedly worse.  There was even missing footage.  For example, the opening scene of ""Bowery Blitzkrieg"" on Alpha and Platinum has Danny (Bobby Jordan) drilling his economics lesson while using a punching bag.  Passport starts the movie from a later scene, Muggs (Leo Gorcey) bullying the bad guy.Passport puts a faint ""Bowery Boys / East Side Kids"" logo in the lower-right corner throughout.  The other two editions do not do this.No edition has any meaningful extras.  I have little hope these films will be cleaned up, Criterion style.Alpha Video tends to have the best quality on its single-film DVD's, but Platinum's four-paks come close and are more cost-effective.  Passport runs last on all counts.",1,Ten Blurs,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1137,"['Passport', 'editions', 'ten', 'East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'movies', 'cheap', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'fun', 'series', 'early', '1940', 'Cheap', 'senses.I', 'had', 'already', 'collected', 'set', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'Platinum', 'Disc', 'Corporation', 'editions', 'had', 'hoped', 'find', 'editions', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Passport', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.Only', 'occasionally', 'would', 'quality', 'even', 'equal', 'Alpha', 'Platinum', 'Usually', 'quality', 'was', 'markedly', 'worse', 'was', 'even', 'missing', 'footage', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'Bowery', 'Blitzkrieg', 'Alpha', 'Platinum', 'Danny', 'Bobby', 'Jordan', 'drilling', 'economics', 'lesson', 'using', 'punching', 'bag', 'Passport', 'movie', 'later', 'scene', 'Muggs', 'Leo', 'Gorcey', 'bullying', 'bad', 'guy.Passport', 'faint', 'Bowery', 'Boys', '/', 'East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'logo', 'lower-right', 'corner', 'other', 'two', 'editions', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'this.No', 'edition', 'meaningful', 'extras', 'have', 'little', 'hope', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'Criterion', 'Video', 'have', 'best', 'quality', 'single-film', 'DVD', 'Platinum', 'four-paks', 'come', 'close', 'are', 'more', 'cost-effective', 'Passport', 'last', 'counts']",Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids Collection

It's like watching old 8mm films that have been warn down. On top of this, stamped in the lower right corner of every movie, for the full length of the movie, is the title of the DVD, Boys of the City The East side Kids. Fortunately after watching the movies for a while I kind of blocked it out but it still annoys me as to why they did this. If you really enjoy the East side Kids then I would say buy this set, it's cheep enough but don't expect restored video.",2,Enjoyable but Poor Quanity DVD's,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,564,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movies', 'again', 'have', 'tell', 'quality', 'very', 'poor', 'watching', 'old', '8mm', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'warn', 'down', 'top', 'stamped', 'lower', 'right', 'corner', 'movie', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'title', 'DVD', 'Boys', 'City', 'East', 'side', 'Kids', 'Fortunately', 'watching', 'movies', 'while', 'kind', 'blocked', 'out', 'still', 'why', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'East', 'side', 'Kids', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'buy', 'set', 'cheep', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'restored', 'video']",Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids Collection

I grew up watching these guys on TV and really enjoy their banter and antics. I've viewed a few of these movies so far and I have to write that the DVD quality is horrible, among the worst I've seen.  It seems as if the source of these DVDs were really bad VHS tapes.  And to add insult to injury, Passport has this bad habit of putting text in the lower right hand corner throughout their DVD films.  In these, ""Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids"" appears in light lettering throughout the film, which is very distracting.  I had another Passport DVD (""Man with the Golden Arm"") and the Passport logo appeared in the lower right throughout the film also.In conclusion, unless you are a big fan of the Bowery Boys, I would definitely not recommend this set and be wary of all DVDs from Passport.",1,Bowery Boys are Great but the DVDs are Lousy,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,884,"['was', 'excited', 'see', '10', 'Bowery', 'Boys/East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'films', 'nice', 'box', 'set', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'guys', 'TV', 'really', 'enjoy', 'banter', 'antics', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'few', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'write', 'DVD', 'quality', 'horrible', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'source', 'DVDs', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Passport', 'bad', 'habit', 'putting', 'text', 'lower', 'right', 'hand', 'corner', 'DVD', 'films', 'Boys', 'Bowery', 'East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'light', 'lettering', 'film', 'very', 'distracting', 'had', 'Passport', 'DVD', 'Man', 'Golden', 'Arm', 'Passport', 'logo', 'appeared', 'lower', 'right', 'film', 'also.In', 'conclusion', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'set', 'be', 'wary', 'DVDs', 'Passport']",Boys of the Bowery - The East Side Kids Collection

The East Side Kids pre-dated the Bowery Boys, and even their names are different.  No Satch, Whitey, etc.  No Malt Shop headquarters.
