Knox ""DVD Collector""","[0, 0]","the movie was done on many levels, but the basic theme was of one man making a comeback through very hard odds. of course Mark Wahlberg plays his usual great character. it is a movie to be appreciated, as well as ask questions about. One would be, how far would one go to change, and be a better person. it is real in the sense that he, at one point did give up, but then came back and followed through with what he had to do. in real life this would be very difficult, if not impossible, in the movie it gives the person hope that it could be done. as i said this is a gritty story, but it does help the average person realize that in life there are choices to be made and all of us, whoever we are can rise above a situation and conquer our fears. sounds very dramatic, but t thought the director did very well in getting the point across, again i am not the final word on this subject. but i look at a movie and want to get something out of it, and this one did that.",5,walking the hard road,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,970,"['movie', 'was', 'done', 'many', 'levels', 'basic', 'theme', 'was', 'one', 'man', 'making', 'comeback', 'very', 'hard', 'odds', 'course', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'usual', 'great', 'character', 'movie', 'be', 'appreciated', 'as', 'well', 'ask', 'questions', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'one', 'go', 'change', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'real', 'sense', 'one', 'point', 'did', 'give', 'up', 'then', 'came', 'back', 'followed', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'movie', 'person', 'hope', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'i', 'said', 'gritty', 'story', 'help', 'average', 'person', 'realize', 'life', 'are', 'choices', 'be', 'made', 'are', 'can', 'rise', 'situation', 'conquer', 'fears', 'very', 'dramatic', 't', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'getting', 'point', 'again', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'final', 'word', 'subject', 'i', 'look', 'movie', 'want', 'get', 'something', 'one', 'did']",Southie

Southie is a gritty and emotional crime drama revolves around life in South Boston. Danny Quinn played by Donnie Wahlberg comes home after a stint in prison and decides to make a positive go at his life. He does have to deal with an alcoholic sister, and a family basically on the verge of total collapse.I'm not overly familiar with Boston nor am I Irish, but that should not a prerequisite for watching and enjoying this movie. I will say that even though this film gave me a microscopic view of Irish working class life and one which is criminal in nature due to the story, it is not an overall representative view of most Irish Americans, who from my own personal experience, are good, proud and passionate people.I will say that even though Donnie may not be as popular or successful as his brother Mark, he is an actor that has truly demonstrated that he can excel and shine in his own right.If you have seen State of Grace, Monument Ave. and similar films, you will enjoy ""Southie"".",5,Excellent!,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,1107,"['film', 'sometimes', 'overlook', 'nonetheless', 'decide', 'take', 'home', 'try', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'Southie', 'gritty', 'emotional', 'crime', 'drama', 'around', 'life', 'South', 'Boston', 'Danny', 'Quinn', 'played', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'home', 'stint', 'prison', 'make', 'positive', 'go', 'life', 'have', 'deal', 'alcoholic', 'sister', 'family', 'basically', 'verge', 'total', 'collapse.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'familiar', 'Boston', 'am', 'Irish', 'should', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'film', 'gave', 'microscopic', 'view', 'Irish', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'one', 'criminal', 'nature', 'due', 'story', 'not', 'overall', 'representative', 'view', 'most', 'Irish', 'Americans', 'who', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'are', 'good', 'proud', 'passionate', 'people.I', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'Donnie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'successful', 'brother', 'Mark', 'actor', 'truly', 'demonstrated', 'can', 'excel', 'shine', 'own', 'right.If', 'have', 'seen', 'State', 'Grace', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'similar', 'films', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Southie']",Southie

That doesn't mean we want to watch your movies, i.e., The Departed, Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Boondock Saints, etc.Southie is right up there with the best of 'em, trying its darndest to take off from the nest of predictability and poorly-crafted screen writing but finding itself falling back to earth in pathetic fashion with each new failed attempt.What's funny is that Bostonian filmmakers are constantly trying to reinforce the tough guy tone that goes with their collective neighborhoods back home. Where Chicago filmmakers constantly try to portray their cities humor and New York filmmakers take every opportunity to reinforce their godlike status in the world, Boston filmmakers have a habit of flexing their muscles in every new piece of piss-poor filmmaking. We get it: you guys are tougher than us, more important than us, and more educated than us (tongue meet cheek). But, your films still suck and your inferiority complex to New York City will always keep the rest of the nation laughing.In case you are truly one of the Irish mafia, please note that this review was written out of humor, so please don't hunt me down and kill me.

507700,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B00000JQVY,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Southie"" is a great little small budget flick from the late 1990's.  It seems very relevant today as the recently apprehended Whitey Bulger, the number two man on the FBI's most wanted list, got his start in South Boston during the 1940's while he lived in the Old Colony projects.  This film was made only a few years after Whitey's crew was broken up, and his 25 years of dominance as the Boston FBI office's ""immune boss"" had ended.  While there is some relevance to Bulger in this film with Lawrence Tierney's character of Colie Powers, it seemed to be more of a ""typical"" mob boss, rather than the eccentric and kill crazy Whitey like Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Departed.""The greatest strength of this movie was the location and acting, which shows some of the most distinctive features of the South Boston landscape at the twilight of Southie's role as heartland of Boston organized crime. Director John Shea (not the John Shea who worked for Bulger as a loan shark and drug dealer, who wrote the memoir, ""Rat Bastards"") and writer James Cummings weave a believable build up to a turf war in Southie between Colie Powers and Butchie Ward. Donnie Wahlberg stars as Danny Quinn, whose character shows a classic relapse to gang life in the effort to protect his friends and family.  This film uses some borrowing or gangster flick cliches, such as beginning with a wedding celebration, just like Godfather I and the ""just when I thought I was out they pull me back in routine"", but I thought this little 90 minute movie has alot of talent and real to life denizens of Southie for actors, for many of whom it was the first time on the big screen. Considering the film's rawness, I thought it holds up to alot of other gangster flicks with much larger budgets. It is no Scorcese movie, but it has alot to offer.""Southie"" also remains true to the themes of the classic mob movies in relation to family and loyalty. Wahlberg's brother in real life plays Danny's brother Davie, with Rose McGowan as sister Cathy who develops some addiction issues.  Through her character Shea explores alot of common Southie  vices that brings power to the bosses, but destroy the average families. Ben Stiller's mother Anne Meara also gives a convincing preformance of the aging widow matriarch with a heart condition.The sense of loyalty is unwavering, as this film definately succeeds in portraying the ""clannishness"" of Boston Irish, with Southie perhaps leading the pack in that quality.  Through Wahlberg's character of Danny, the main theme of cyclical violence is explored, though perhaps left somewhat open ended (this movie could easily be developed into a sequel). There is also a tragic pull which accompanies the futility of escape from the lifestyle once you have joined it, or in Danny's case, born into it. Since the Walhberg's grew up in Dorchester (Marky Mark had quite the juvenile rap sheet), as a viewer I could really believe his comprehension of the role and all the dimensions of organized crime and how it is rooted into neighborhoods.",4,"Indie hit ""straight outta Southie""",1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,3050,"['Southie', 'great', 'little', 'small', 'budget', 'flick', 'late', '1990', 'very', 'relevant', 'today', 'recently', 'apprehended', 'Whitey', 'Bulger', 'number', 'two', 'man', 'FBI', 'most', 'wanted', 'list', 'got', 'start', 'South', 'Boston', '1940', 'lived', 'Old', 'Colony', 'projects', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'Whitey', 'crew', 'was', 'broken', 'up', '25', 'years', 'dominance', 'Boston', 'FBI', 'office', 'immune', 'boss', 'had', 'ended', 'relevance', 'Bulger', 'film', 'Lawrence', 'Tierney', 'character', 'Colie', 'Powers', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'typical', 'mob', 'boss', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'kill', 'crazy', 'Whitey', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'Departed', 'greatest', 'strength', 'movie', 'was', 'location', 'acting', 'most', 'distinctive', 'features', 'South', 'Boston', 'landscape', 'twilight', 'Southie', 'role', 'heartland', 'Boston', 'organized', 'crime', 'Director', 'John', 'Shea', 'not', 'John', 'Shea', 'who', 'worked', 'Bulger', 'loan', 'shark', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'wrote', 'memoir', 'Rat', 'Bastards', 'James', 'Cummings', 'weave', 'believable', 'build', 'up', 'turf', 'war', 'Southie', 'Colie', 'Powers', 'Butchie', 'Ward', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Danny', 'Quinn', 'character', 'classic', 'relapse', 'gang', 'life', 'effort', 'protect', 'friends', 'family', 'film', 'borrowing', 'gangster', 'flick', 'cliches', 'such', 'beginning', 'wedding', 'celebration', 'just', 'Godfather', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'pull', 'back', 'routine', 'thought', 'little', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'alot', 'talent', 'real', 'life', 'denizens', 'Southie', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'Considering', 'film', 'rawness', 'thought', 'alot', 'other', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'much', 'larger', 'budgets', 'Scorcese', 'movie', 'alot', 'offer', 'Southie', 'also', 'true', 'themes', 'classic', 'mob', 'movies', 'relation', 'family', 'loyalty', 'Wahlberg', 'brother', 'real', 'life', 'Danny', 'brother', 'Davie', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'sister', 'Cathy', 'who', 'addiction', 'issues', 'character', 'Shea', 'alot', 'common', 'Southie', 'vices', 'power', 'bosses', 'average', 'families', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'also', 'convincing', 'preformance', 'aging', 'widow', 'matriarch', 'heart', 'condition.The', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'unwavering', 'film', 'definately', 'portraying', 'clannishness', 'Boston', 'Irish', 'Southie', 'perhaps', 'leading', 'pack', 'quality', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'Danny', 'main', 'theme', 'cyclical', 'violence', 'explored', 'perhaps', 'left', 'somewhat', 'open', 'ended', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'developed', 'sequel', 'also', 'tragic', 'pull', 'futility', 'escape', 'lifestyle', 'once', 'have', 'joined', 'Danny', 'case', 'born', 'Walhberg', 'grew', 'up', 'Dorchester', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'had', 'quite', 'juvenile', 'rap', 'sheet', 'viewer', 'could', 'really', 'believe', 'comprehension', 'role', 'dimensions', 'organized', 'crime', 'how', 'rooted', 'neighborhoods']",Southie

Although in overall effect it is not on the level of 'Mean Streets', it a still a very solid production; on the level of ""Monument Avenue"" and ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"". I suppose that a rather ordinary screenplay and a downbeat ending put some people off.But this small film did a fine job of presenting a believable (if troubled) family, it utilized some interesting (out of favor) camera techniques to advance the storyline, and it showcased some excellent acting. It is refreshing to watch something without a hint of computer generated crap. If your production fundmentals are sound you don't need that kind of distraction.There are two diametrically opposite scenes between Donnie Wahlberg and Rose McGowan that work so well that you wonder why they didn't alter the script to expand McGowan's part . One is in an Irish bar where Danny convinces his sister to enter an in-patient alcohol treatment program. The other is a few days later when he visits her in the middle of the program. The contrast between the intensity levels of these two scenes is amazing and McGowan pulls off the dramatic performance of her career. She is great at comedy but in these scenes she shows unexpected dramatic range. 'Southie' would be worth watching for just these two scenes but it is a solid effort from start to finish.
