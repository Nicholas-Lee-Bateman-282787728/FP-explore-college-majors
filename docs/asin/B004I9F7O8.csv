Of course there is an element of melodrama but overall I laughed and smiled through most of it!  It seems geared at a slightly younger audience but enjoyable for all ages.  I love the element of folklore.  It made the show so interesting!  I absolutely fell in love with the male lead and the halfling vet (so cute!).  The female lead was beautiful and had so much personality.  Her character practically jumped right off the screen! The secondary characters (the aunt and director) were a bit over the top but fun.Family viewing? So far this is the cleanest Korean drama I have watched.  There was one brief ""love"" scene they are watching on TV and a few comments on mating (after all she is a 9 tailed fox).

If you liked &#34;Splash&#34;, you will find this to your liking, as there are many similarities.What I found remarkable about this series was how all the characters grew and developed as individuals (even the silly aunt and her director boyfriend).  Nearly all the characters were to some degree self obsessed, and stunted by their narcissism.Released from her 500 year captivity in a painted scroll, Miho, the 9-tail fox , saves Dae-woong from fatal injuries, and tags onto him to keep her energy pearl close while he heals.  Dae Woong is suitably  scared when he comprehends that this crazy girl is a genuine 9-tail fox (imagine finding out your gorgeous new friend is also a werewolf!).He has ambitions of an action film career, and needs her energy pearl to achieve it.  All the while she is learning of life in modern Seoul, the joys of korean beef (this is an ongoing ad), and the subtleties of being human.Another character is a demon queller, who discovers she is the reincarnated spirit of a lover he lost centuries ago, and hasn't gotten over.Other characters are the sidelined girlfriend , the wannabe girlfriend oblivious to the attention of Dae-Woongs buddy, and the anxious grandfather who desperately wants Dae-Woong to grow up.This makes for a delightful blend of mythological fantasy, romance, and fun combining with a message of tolerance and caring for others.Miho is truly a foxy lady.",5,personal growth,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1522,"['Having', 'loved', '34', 'Painted', 'Skin-', 'resurrection', '34', '9-tail', 'fox', 'character', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'liked', '34', 'Splash', '34', 'will', 'find', 'liking', 'are', 'many', 'similarities.What', 'found', 'remarkable', 'series', 'was', 'how', 'characters', 'grew', 'developed', 'individuals', 'even', 'silly', 'aunt', 'director', 'boyfriend', 'Nearly', 'characters', 'were', 'degree', 'self', 'obsessed', 'stunted', 'narcissism.Released', '500', 'year', 'captivity', 'painted', 'scroll', 'Miho', '9-tail', 'fox', 'Dae-woong', 'fatal', 'injuries', 'tags', 'keep', 'energy', 'pearl', 'close', 'Dae', 'Woong', 'suitably', 'scared', 'when', 'crazy', 'girl', 'genuine', '9-tail', 'fox', 'imagine', 'finding', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'friend', 'also', 'werewolf', '.He', 'ambitions', 'action', 'film', 'career', 'energy', 'pearl', 'achieve', 'while', 'learning', 'life', 'modern', 'Seoul', 'joys', 'korean', 'beef', 'ongoing', 'ad', 'subtleties', 'being', 'character', 'demon', 'queller', 'who', 'reincarnated', 'spirit', 'lover', 'lost', 'centuries', 'ago', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'over.Other', 'characters', 'are', 'sidelined', 'girlfriend', 'wannabe', 'girlfriend', 'oblivious', 'attention', 'Dae-Woongs', 'buddy', 'anxious', 'grandfather', 'who', 'desperately', 'Dae-Woong', 'grow', 'up.This', 'delightful', 'blend', 'mythological', 'fantasy', 'romance', 'fun', 'combining', 'message', 'tolerance', 'caring', 'others.Miho', 'truly', 'foxy', 'lady']",N/A

1410486,A22KG0EAUW6U7I,B004I9F7O8,Lost Wanderer,"[0, 0]","A ne'er-do-well rich kid Tae-Woong accidentally releases Mi-Ho, a nine-tailed fox who can transform into a beautiful girl, from a painting in a shrine in which she had been locked up for 500 years. Tae-Woong fell off the cliff and got fatally injured while running away from the shrine, but Mi-Ho gives her magical energy and saves him.Mi-Ho follows him into the human world, and later learns how to be a human from a mysterious sorcerer Tong-Ju. She needs a human to help her out and although at first Tae-Woong was reluctant, he ends up making a deal with her when he realizes he also needs Mi-Ho's magical energy to star in an action movie while still recovering from the injury.However by the time they realized there was a serious catch in the deal that Tong-Ju had not told them about - for Mi-Ho to be a human, Tae-Woong has to give up all his human spirit to Mi-Ho and die, otherwise Mi-Ho will die when she loses all her Kumiho spirit - they were deeply in love with each other and they are faced with the ultimate choice of survival and sacrifice.I bought this for my Korean language study, but I have to say there is something truly magical about this drama. The magic is that it is a fantasy comedy, yet it is also about the ultimate sacrifice one can make for others, usually associated only with war dramas but without their heavy-handedness. It stays very light-hearted and comical yet very heartfelt and moving. It would have been even better without some brain-rotting TV soap stuff, evil antagonists and so on, but that may be asking too much.The transformations of the two characters - good at heart but immature and irresponsible Tae-Woong and carefree, wide-eyed Mi-Ho to those who won't hesitate to make ultimate sacrifices for each other - are very well constructed. The scene where dying Mi-Ho watches someone else's wedding and reminisces the time 500 years ago when she waited for human suitors in vain, and then Tae-Woong arranges a photo shoot with Mi-Ho wearing red dots on her cheeks - a Korean tradition for brides - is one of the most poignant you will ever see in any drama, and I really mean it.

1410488,A17K8XNE6EVFLI,B004I9F7O8,"Tamara Andre ""tamarandra""","[0, 0]","I had low expectations for ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho"".  The title left me cold.  I was pretty sure it would be vapid and silly.  Kdrama, as good as it can be, can also be extremely frothy.  I bought it several months ago, but couldnt muster up the interest so I watched other dramas in the meantime, with varying degrees of interest.  Loved You're Beautiful, and cried a lot during that.  Liked  Coffee Prince but found it pretty middle of the road for Kdrama.  Liked Sungkyunkawn Scandal quite a bit.  Liked Secret Garden but not as much as You're Beautiful.  None of them were as good as Hana Yori Dango, or the Korean version of Boys over Flowers, but they kept me interested.  Finally I ran out of things to watch and decided to try ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho""  About Half Way through the first episode, I realized that it was special.  The music, expecially the haunting ""Fire Rain"" by Lee Sun Hee, was expectional.  The writing fun and crisp and the cast, as usual in Kdrama, gorgeous and extremely talented.  But it was the two leads who were magical.  Lee Seung Gi as Daewoong, and Shin Min-Ah and the Gumiho ""Mi-Ho"" are remarkable, even  by Korean Standards.As someone else here remarked, they are my new favourite couple of all time, replacing Jan Matsumoto Doumyouji Tsukasa, and Inoue Mao as Makino Tuskushi.  Their acting is the kind of deeply emotional character acting I havent seen, maybe ever.  About Halfway through, MGIAG transforms from 70% froth / 30% depth, to the reverse.  Each episode, although still charming and funny, takes on a more tragic, heartbreaking overtone, as the child like, kind hearted Gumiho, played by the miraculously talented Shin Min-Ah, falls more in love with the ever more reluctantly in love Daewoong, played by the equally talented Lee Seung Gi.  In fact, if Shin Min-Ah with her stunning looks and quirky, natural and very effective acting style, runs away with the movie in the beginning, it is Lee Seun Gi as Daewoong who absolutely carries the series in the final two or three  episodes.  His interpretation of a heartbroken man who finds that he cannot save the life of the woman who betwitched his soul, is beyond belief.  I cried so hard I actually had to stuff my face in a pillow, and I cry just as hard every time I watch this, which is often.Shin  Min-Ah and Lee Seun Gi will both charm and possess you in ways that make me think of classic Hollywood films like ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"" or ""I married a Witch"".  The actors are that talented, and the Kdrama itself is wonderfully good natured and devoid of the  nudity, crudeness, bad language and bad attitudes that are hallmarks of American Cinema of the last few decades.  Which is one  reason so many people turn to Kdrama, or JDrama, etc.  I would much rather watch a romance which focuses on the romance than watch what passes for entertainment in Hollywood.If you are a romantic, do yourself a favor and buy or rent ""My Girlfriend is Gumiho"", and make sure you stock up on the Kleenix, you're going to need it!",5,SIMPLY AMAZING -- Korean Drama is the now what Hollywood once was,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,3028,"['had', 'low', 'expectations', 'Girlfriend', 'Gumiho', 'title', 'left', 'cold', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'vapid', 'silly', 'Kdrama', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'extremely', 'frothy', 'bought', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'couldnt', 'muster', 'up', 'interest', 'so', 'watched', 'other', 'dramas', 'meantime', 'varying', 'degrees', 'interest', 'Loved', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'cried', 'lot', 'Liked', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'found', 'pretty', 'middle', 'road', 'Kdrama', 'Liked', 'Sungkyunkawn', 'Scandal', 'quite', 'bit', 'Liked', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'not', 'as', 'much', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'None', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'Hana', 'Yori', 'Dango', 'Korean', 'version', 'Boys', 'Flowers', 'kept', 'interested', 'Finally', 'ran', 'things', 'watch', 'decided', 'try', 'Girlfriend', 'Gumiho', 'Half', 'Way', 'first', 'episode', 'realized', 'was', 'special', 'music', 'expecially', 'haunting', 'Fire', 'Rain', 'Lee', 'Sun', 'Hee', 'was', 'expectional', 'writing', 'fun', 'crisp', 'cast', 'usual', 'Kdrama', 'gorgeous', 'extremely', 'talented', 'was', 'two', 'leads', 'who', 'were', 'magical', 'Lee', 'Seung', 'Gi', 'Daewoong', 'Shin', 'Min-Ah', 'Gumiho', 'Mi-Ho', 'are', 'remarkable', 'even', 'Korean', 'Standards.As', 'someone', 'else', 'here', 'remarked', 'are', 'new', 'favourite', 'couple', 'time', 'replacing', 'Jan', 'Matsumoto', 'Doumyouji', 'Tsukasa', 'Inoue', 'Mao', 'Makino', 'Tuskushi', 'acting', 'kind', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'character', 'acting', 'havent', 'seen', 'maybe', 'ever', 'Halfway', 'MGIAG', '70', '%', '/', '30', '%', 'depth', 'reverse', 'episode', 'still', 'charming', 'funny', 'more', 'tragic', 'heartbreaking', 'overtone', 'child', 'kind', 'hearted', 'Gumiho', 'played', 'miraculously', 'talented', 'Shin', 'Min-Ah', 'more', 'love', 'ever', 'more', 'reluctantly', 'love', 'Daewoong', 'played', 'equally', 'talented', 'Lee', 'Seung', 'Gi', 'fact', 'Shin', 'Min-Ah', 'stunning', 'looks', 'quirky', 'natural', 'very', 'effective', 'acting', 'style', 'away', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Lee', 'Seun', 'Gi', 'Daewoong', 'who', 'absolutely', 'series', 'final', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'interpretation', 'heartbroken', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'betwitched', 'soul', 'belief', 'cried', 'so', 'hard', 'actually', 'had', 'stuff', 'face', 'pillow', 'cry', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'time', 'watch', 'often.Shin', 'Min-Ah', 'Lee', 'Seun', 'Gi', 'will', 'charm', 'possess', 'ways', 'make', 'think', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'Ghost', 'Mrs', 'Muir', 'married', 'Witch', 'actors', 'are', 'talented', 'Kdrama', 'wonderfully', 'good', 'natured', 'devoid', 'nudity', 'crudeness', 'bad', 'language', 'bad', 'attitudes', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'American', 'Cinema', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'Which', 'one', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'turn', 'Kdrama', 'JDrama', 'etc', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'romance', 'romance', 'watch', 'what', 'entertainment', 'Hollywood.If', 'are', 'romantic', 'do', 'favor', 'buy', 'rent', 'Girlfriend', 'Gumiho', 'make', 'sure', 'stock', 'up', 'Kleenix', ""'re"", 'going', 'need']",N/A
