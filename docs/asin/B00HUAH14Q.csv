I guess, as in most things, I like the characters most, but oh, what an opulent set.This is so much better than Downton Abbey. So much. Downton is getting ridiculous with its 21st century mores in early 20th century settings. I love 21st century mores, but not when set in inappropriate times. I usually love period pieces, and I will watch Downton, but I do dislike that aspect. It makes it unbelievable. There are wonderful sets there, too.In Selfridge's first season, there was probably more to do with the real history of Selfridge's than this season. So that season was even better, but this one is very good. In this one, we have more of the made up stories and characters. I'm sure. That probably makes it vary into the wrong century somewhat also, but not nearly as badly as Downton Abbey.In this season, we get to see more of Miss Mardle and Kitty Hawkins. Both great characters. I think I like Miss Mardle the most. Kitty is more coy and has more feminine &#34;wiles,&#34; but she is a strong character, too. Miss Mardle is a middle-aged woman, head of a department. She gave up her child-bearing years to love and wait for a married man whose wife was ill. When the wife dies, he drops Miss Mardle for a younger woman supposedly because he wants to leave a legacy (children). Miss Mardle's strength in moving past that while still having to work with the man is admirable. Suprisingly, I didn't recognize the actress as Watson's wife in the new Sherlock series with Cumberbatch.I also love Lady Mae Loxley, but that's another story.

The characters are lively and entertaining, and this year, even with WWI onset, they kept our interest up and it wasn't all gloomy.  The show itself is so beautifully choreographed, the costumes, hairstyles and even the furniture and fixtures at the store are so gorgeous.  It is easy to become invested in these characters.  Jeremy Piven is a good lead, I know many people are critical of him, but he brings a good energy to the role.  I loved that the last episode left no real cliffhangers and ended up neatly.  My only complaint is that Agnes should have married Victor!  But I like Henri too.The way they show how women's roles were changing is wonderful, and I adore all the strong female leads, including Amanda Abbington, who is wonderful as Miss Mardle.  The show has drama, humor, it will tug at your heartstrings, and you wind up really rooting for these characters, which a good show will make you so.Let's face it, the main reason we watch this is that Downton is off until next year, but it is a good substitute, and I would say that this season 2 of Selfridge beat Downton season 4 by a mile.

It is now 1914 and some of the new circumstances will surprise you, and add to the interest of the show. You will see how Selfridges Store and its occupants respond to WWI and its effects in this season.Harry Selfridge (Jeremy Piven) is more self-aware, less ebullient, and more contemplative regarding his past actions. He wants to put his marriage and family first - will he be able to? Rose Selfridge (Frances O'Connor) attracts him with her Edwardian sensuousness which makes you wonder why Harry would ever stray. Of course, Lady Mae Oxley (Katherine Kelly) fairly smolders and ignites every scene in which she is in. Agnes (Aisling Loftus) has a luminosity which blends with Henri's (Gregory Fitoussi) French chivalry and charm when they work on store designs together. Victor (Trystan Gravelle), the waiter, is an enigma - is he going to win over Agnes?  The faces of all of the characters just suit them - marvelous bit of casting.The fashions have changed, featuring new hairstyles and clothes in the second decade of the 20th century . There is a deepening of the characters as more of their backstory is revealed. You see why they are the way they are.The script, by Andrew Davies (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 1995, MIDDLEMARCH) sparkles and is based upon the biography SHOPPING, SEDUCTION & MR. SELFRIDGE.

I highly recommend this series.  The only problem I had with both Season One and Season Two was defective DVD's that would not work for some of the episodes.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 5]","As I post this review there are already 53 reviews on Amazon (even though the DVD and BD will not be released until April 29th- I was provided with an advance copy for review). This is because Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats (Broadcast TV, Amazon Instant, DVD and BD) together and lists the reviews of  every format. So I always advise folks to sort by Newest First and then look to see which format the review is covering. Also, the PBS Home Video release is marked as &#8220;Original UK Edition&#8221;. For many British TV shows (&#8220;Sherlock&#8221; for instance) the version which aired on PBS in the US is the EDITED edition, not the original UK one.That is usually due to language or violence (or possibly partial nudity. Since each episode here runs about 47 minutes (the show was not a BBC production but was created for ITV &#8211; the commercial network in Britain) and there is nothing on the home video version that might have been &#8220;censored&#8221; by PBS, I can&#8217;t tell you if the version &#8211; in this case &#8211; is different. I have not watched the broadcast version.With that said, this is review of the BD version. My guess is that you have found this review by searching for &#8220;Season 2&#8221; of the series. If that is the case, please read on. If you have not seen Season 1, then I urge you to get that one first as it really provides the background for the characters and story. Then come back fore Season 2.I really liked Season One of this series, though I have to say I enjoyed the other  British drama series about a department store &#8211; &#8220;The Paradise&#8221; &#8211; a bit more. But, both are worth watching and both get five stars from me. Season 2 of MS picks up the story five years after Season 1 left off. There is no real &#8220;catch up&#8221; as Episode One begins (another reason to see Season 1 first) but you soon get the hang of it.  While Season 1 was about the building of the famous department store, Season Two focuses on two areas:  World War I is rearing it&#8217;s head and the male staff members are heading to the front, and there is corruption going on in the local government. These two stories form much of the plot. But it is the huge list of characters in the drama that make this show a joy to watch and, while I have always found Jeremy Piven&#8217;s role of the title character over played and &#8211; frankly-  annoying,  he really isn&#8217;t on screen that much and the other actors are just brilliant &#8211; especially actress Aisling Loftus as &#8220;Agnes&#8221;,  Gr&eacute;gory Fitoussi as Henri Leclair and Frances O&#8217;Connor as Rose Selfridge &#8211; and are what makes this show work.There are a few mysteries in this season and some &#8220;secrets&#8221; are revealed so &#8211; since I&#8217;m not an advocate of &#8220;spoilers&#8221; &#8211; I won&#8217;t say any more about the plot, and urge you to be careful of reviews giving too much away. It really spoils the fun. And, if you are watching the show on PBS where it hasn&#8217;t ended yet, it will only decrease the enjoyment for you. I will say that by the 10th episode many issues are resolved but a few are not, leaving things open for a Season 3 (in March it was announced that there will be a Season3, though production has not yet started).The production set is &#8211; as you know if you have seen Season 1 &#8211; amazingly detailed and the Bluray image is great!The home video version has two bonus features which add to the enjoyment of watching the series. There are 10 brief &#8220;Deleted Scenes&#8221; (for a total of 10 minutes). Many of these appear to be &#8220;alternate takes&#8221; of scenes already in the show but a few &#8211; a seduction scene by Lady Mae and Mr. Crabb&#8217;s birthday &#8211; really add to the story. The other bonus is a &#8221;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurette. This 29 minute piece is comprised of comments from all the major cast members &#8211; you can hear their real voices and accents (Frances O&#8217;Connor as Rose Selfridge has a thick British accent totally different from her Chicago one in the production)- blended with scenes from the series. They each discuss their characters. It&#8217;s nice but not essential viewing.So there you have it. If you liked Season One you&#8217;ll definitely want Season 2 (and, like me, anxiously await Season 3).I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of Blu Ray version  of the SECOND SEASON of this wonderful character-driven British TV series.,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,4496,"['post', 'review', 'are', 'already', '53', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'even', 'DVD', 'BD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'April', '29th-', 'was', 'provided', 'advance', 'copy', 'review', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'Broadcast', 'TV', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'DVD', 'BD', 'together', 'reviews', 'format', 'always', 'advise', 'folks', 'sort', 'Newest', 'First', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'review', 'covering', 'Also', 'PBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'release', 'marked', '8220', 'Original', 'UK', 'Edition', '8221', 'many', 'British', 'TV', 'shows', '8220', 'Sherlock', '8221', 'instance', 'version', 'aired', 'PBS', 'US', 'EDITED', 'edition', 'not', 'original', 'UK', 'one.That', 'usually', 'due', 'language', 'violence', 'possibly', 'partial', 'nudity', 'episode', 'here', '47', 'minutes', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'BBC', 'production', 'was', 'created', 'ITV', '8211', 'commercial', 'network', 'Britain', 'nothing', 'home', 'video', 'version', 'might', 'have', 'been', '8220', 'censored', '8221', 'PBS', 'can', '8217', 'tell', 'version', '8211', 'case', '8211', 'different', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'broadcast', 'version.With', 'said', 'review', 'BD', 'version', 'guess', 'have', 'found', 'review', 'searching', '8220', 'Season', '2', '8221', 'series', 'case', 'please', 'read', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'then', 'urge', 'get', 'one', 'first', 'really', 'background', 'characters', 'story', 'Then', 'come', 'back', 'fore', 'Season', '2.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Season', 'One', 'series', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'British', 'drama', 'series', 'department', 'store', '8211', '8220', 'Paradise', '8221', '8211', 'bit', 'more', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'Season', '2', 'MS', 'up', 'story', 'five', 'years', 'Season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'real', '8220', 'catch', 'up', '8221', 'Episode', 'One', 'reason', 'see', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'soon', 'get', 'hang', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'building', 'famous', 'department', 'store', 'Season', 'Two', 'focuses', 'two', 'areas', 'World', 'War', 'rearing', '8217', 's', 'head', 'male', 'staff', 'members', 'are', 'heading', 'front', 'corruption', 'going', 'local', 'government', 'two', 'stories', 'form', 'much', 'plot', 'huge', 'list', 'characters', 'drama', 'make', 'show', 'joy', 'watch', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', '8217', 's', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'played', '8211', 'frankly-', 'annoying', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'screen', 'much', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'brilliant', '8211', 'especially', 'Aisling', 'Loftus', '8220', 'Agnes', '8221', 'Gr', 'eacute', 'gory', 'Fitoussi', 'Henri', 'Leclair', 'Frances', 'O', '8217', 'Connor', 'Rose', 'Selfridge', '8211', 'are', 'what', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'mysteries', 'season', '8220', 'secrets', '8221', 'are', 'revealed', 'so', '8211', '8217', 'not', 'advocate', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', '8211', 'won', '8217', 't', 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'urge', 'be', 'careful', 'reviews', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'really', 'fun', 'are', 'watching', 'show', 'PBS', 'where', '8217', 't', 'ended', 'yet', 'will', 'only', 'decrease', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'say', '10th', 'episode', 'many', 'issues', 'are', 'resolved', 'few', 'are', 'not', 'leaving', 'things', 'open', 'Season', '3', 'March', 'was', 'announced', 'will', 'be', 'Season3', 'production', 'not', 'yet', 'started', '.The', 'production', 'set', '8211', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'Season', '1', '8211', 'amazingly', 'detailed', 'Bluray', 'image', 'great', 'home', 'video', 'version', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'series', 'are', '10', 'brief', '8220', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', '8221', 'total', '10', 'minutes', 'Many', 'appear', 'be', '8220', 'alternate', '8221', 'scenes', 'already', 'show', 'few', '8211', 'seduction', 'scene', 'Lady', 'Mae', 'Mr.', 'Crabb', '8217', 's', 'birthday', '8211', 'really', 'add', 'story', 'other', 'bonus', '8221', 'Scenes', '8221', 'featurette', '29', 'minute', 'piece', 'comprised', 'comments', 'major', 'cast', 'members', '8211', 'can', 'hear', 'real', 'voices', 'accents', 'Frances', 'O', '8217', 'Connor', 'Rose', 'Selfridge', 'thick', 'British', 'accent', 'totally', 'different', 'Chicago', 'one', 'production', 'blended', 'scenes', 'series', 'discuss', 'characters', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'not', 'essential', 'viewing.So', 'have', 'liked', 'Season', 'One', '8217', 'definitely', 'want', 'Season', '2', 'anxiously', 'await', 'Season', '3', '.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A
