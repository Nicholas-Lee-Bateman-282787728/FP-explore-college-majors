1696591,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00JF5GAIW,ahoffoss,"[5, 8]","To be straightforward, I gave this movie 3 stars, NOT because it was good, but because it wasn't completely terrible!  Sorry if that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but let's see if I can clear this up a bit.  As with most ""straight to DVD/VOD"" sequels, this one isn't nearly as entertaining as the original from which it is taken.  If the movie were going to be really good, it would have gotten a major release.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have the star power or the intensity of the original.  What it DOES have is a total and complete reveal of ""Rusty Nail"" constantly throughout the film.  BIG MISTAKE!  This only takes away from the terror of his role.  We aren't supposed to see him.  He's supposed to be a sort of ""phantom"" to the viewer, in my opinion.  Also (this might be a spoiler), but if you're in a souped up RACECAR, just leave that guy in the dust.  He's in a Big Rig that can probably only top out at 90.  Just seemed to be a REALLY dumb part of the story to me.  Either way, this movie is probably exactly what you think it is.  It's a time filler that, while really bad compared to the original, isn't too bad if you're just in the mood for some cheap entertainment.Final Verdict:  PassIf this review has helped you, please let me know by clicking ""yes"" below.

1696596,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00JF5GAIW,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[2, 4]","I thought I could count on this one to satisfy but instead it was just a tease. First off, Rusty is played by a different actor. While he was never a unitary character (image and voice supplied by 2 different actors; the voice JR2 was actually played by a different person than in 1 but he did a good job of imitating it), in JR3, the voice is altogether different. Not that its all in the voice but this character was 90% voice in the past. The original voice actor was ideal and its a shame they couldn't get him on board. Rusty's voice was distinctive. Not so in this one. He comes across like a regular trucker type, of course until he busts out the instruments of torture. Therein lies the rub. For me, the most gratifying part of horror movies is the visceral tension they generate (at their best, of course), and if there's a puzzle to solve, even better. But I felt no tension while watching this whatsoever. So on to the next one...  Still, if you are iike me, you will watch this regardless of what anyone feels about it.

1696600,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00JF5GAIW,Micheal Hunt,"[3, 6]","It was quite a surprise to pick this up after not even hearing a 3rd sequel was in the works. The first movie was a great ride, the second was OK, but the 3rd is the bloodiest Rusty Nail has ever been.The movie kicks off with a bit of a homage to the original, just to get this thing into gear, then the rest of the plot involves a group of race drivers and their team. They are heading to Canada for a race, and decide while they are on a long stretch of highway with no one around for miles, they may as well take the souped up race car for a spin. But guess who else is rolling along that highway? When the racer decides to do a stupid trick and almost run Rusty off the road... well, if you've seen the other two films, you know Rusty isn't much for just reporting things or letting anyone off the hook that easy. Rusty chases them down and you can guess where things go from there!It's filmed well, the acting is decent, sounds fine, and the blood and gore effects are pretty good. It's a nice combination that does a 3rd sequel well, and making me hope a 4th installment gets made.It's not the perfect film however, sure I may watch it again now and then, but there is a couple of little things I'd have done differently.  I think even tho they never showed a proper shot of Rusty Nail's face, there was a bit too much of it exposed, and it should have remained a mysterious look hiding in shadows. There was a few moments in this I just thought that showing Rusty's face made him less intimidating. He kind of reminds me of the John Goodman look in The Big Lebowski. But I guess it was made up for in that Rusty really seems to be off his meds this time around, and is more psychotic than ever, and getting a little more creative with his kills!",4,A meaner mother trucker than ever before!,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,1752,"['was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'hearing', '3rd', 'sequel', 'was', 'works', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'ride', 'second', 'was', 'OK', '3rd', 'bloodiest', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'ever', 'been.The', 'movie', 'kicks', 'off', 'bit', 'homage', 'original', 'just', 'get', 'thing', 'gear', 'then', 'rest', 'plot', 'group', 'race', 'drivers', 'team', 'are', 'heading', 'Canada', 'race', 'decide', 'are', 'long', 'stretch', 'highway', 'one', 'around', 'miles', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'souped', 'up', 'race', 'car', 'spin', 'guess', 'who', 'else', 'rolling', 'along', 'highway', 'When', 'racer', 'do', 'stupid', 'trick', 'almost', 'run', 'Rusty', 'road', 'well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'know', 'Rusty', ""n't"", 'much', 'just', 'reporting', 'things', 'letting', 'anyone', 'hook', 'easy', 'Rusty', 'down', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'things', 'go', 'there', 'filmed', 'well', 'acting', 'decent', 'fine', 'blood', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'nice', 'combination', '3rd', 'sequel', 'well', 'making', 'hope', '4th', 'installment', 'made.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'however', 'sure', 'may', 'watch', 'again', 'now', 'then', 'couple', 'little', 'things', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'think', 'even', 'tho', 'never', 'showed', 'proper', 'shot', 'Rusty', 'Nail', 'face', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'exposed', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'mysterious', 'look', 'hiding', 'shadows', 'was', 'few', 'moments', 'just', 'thought', 'showing', 'Rusty', 'face', 'made', 'less', 'intimidating', 'kind', 'reminds', 'John', 'Goodman', 'look', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'guess', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'Rusty', 'really', 'be', 'off', 'meds', 'time', 'more', 'psychotic', 'ever', 'getting', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'kills']",N/A

As a joke they decide to cut off a truck driver. This little action pits them against the dangerous Rusty Nail (Kirzinger). There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. The original was good and tense because it was new and different. A harmless prank that you could see yourself doing leads to something no one can imagine. Much like everything in the last 10 years if enough people like it a franchise begins. The second one was a bland version of the original and this one isn't much better. The thing that made the first one so interesting was the originality of it. This one has no surprises at all and you can see everything coming a mile away. All that said though because this is the third movie in the series and since it is a straight to video B-rate movie you really can't expect much more then that. Overall, exactly what you would expect from the third movie in a series that didn't need a sequel to begin with.
