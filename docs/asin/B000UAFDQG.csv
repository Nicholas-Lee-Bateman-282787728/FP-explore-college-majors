1094593,A230ZS8F6I0AGM,B000UAFDQG,"hawthorne wood ""hawthorne wood""","[5, 9]","This is on my ""worst videos of all time"" list.  Jason Gedrick should be arrested for homicidal Botox. He's supposed to be a hothead who starts fights at the drop of a hat.  Unfortunately,  he has only one expression: a plastic sneer, and is far too groomed and tanned to be a threat to anyone but the unsuspecting viewers of this lame piece of celluloid.  Donny Wahlberg, a good actor, is wasted here.  There isn't a lick of sense to the entire thing.  I only watched it for laughs.  It really is hilariously awful. At one point Donny says to Jason that he didn't see ""No one and nothin'.""  That should have been the title of this film.  Still - it's funny as heck.  Maybe you should see it, stoned, with like-minded friends.  Worst case scenario: you doze off to the tinny, ditzy disco music, hypnotically-gyrating bimbos and Jason Gedrick saying, for the umpteen-millionth time, ""You goin' soft on me, Andy?""  Or maybe that was just a million other bad actors in a million other bad so-called gangster movies saying the same thing.",1,Saps of South Beach,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1033,"['worst', 'videos', 'time', 'list', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'should', 'be', 'arrested', 'homicidal', 'Botox', 'supposed', 'be', 'hothead', 'who', 'fights', 'drop', 'hat', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'expression', 'plastic', 'sneer', 'far', 'too', 'groomed', 'tanned', 'be', 'threat', 'anyone', 'unsuspecting', 'viewers', 'lame', 'piece', 'celluloid', 'Donny', 'Wahlberg', 'good', 'actor', 'wasted', 'here', ""n't"", 'lick', 'sense', 'entire', 'thing', 'only', 'watched', 'laughs', 'really', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'one', 'point', 'Donny', 'Jason', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'nothin', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'title', 'film', 'Still', 'funny', 'heck', 'Maybe', 'should', 'see', 'stoned', 'like-minded', 'friends', 'Worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'doze', 'tinny', 'ditzy', 'disco', 'music', 'hypnotically-gyrating', 'bimbos', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'saying', 'umpteen-millionth', 'time', 'goin', 'soft', 'Andy', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'million', 'other', 'bad', 'actors', 'million', 'other', 'bad', 'so-called', 'gangster', 'movies', 'saying', 'same', 'thing']",Kings of South Beach
