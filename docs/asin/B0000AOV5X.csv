His supportive role gave great credibility to the movie. The suspense and the mood will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the very end.

765189,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B0000AOV5X,Genevieve Hayes,"[2, 2]","A seemingly chance encounter with an old lady results in architect Michael Lewis (Andrew McCarthy) developing the ability to see and communicate with dead people. One of the ghosts he sees is that of a little girl who was murdered by a serial killer and Lewis is enlisted to solve her murder so that she can rest in peace.This movie was shown on Australian television as a lunch time movie (a time-slot not exactly renown for it's high quality entertainment) and I watched it solely because I will watch just about anything that stars Andrew McCarthy, no matter how bad it might be (and a lot of his later films are pretty bad). It, therefore, came as quite a surprise to me when this film turned out to be a pretty good murder mystery that kept me guessing right up until the end. This movie is, in fact, a pilot for a TV series that was never made, and at the end of it, I was genuinely disappointed that this series hadn't been picked up. I really wanted to see more.This movie was written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, director of such classics as ""Resident Evil"" and ""Alien vs Predator"" (interpret that information whichever way you choose) and has an interesting ""Alice in Wonderland"" theme throughout (which I think is meant to symbolize Lewis's transition into a strange new world, ""down the rabbit hole"", so to speak - whatever it means, I enjoyed spotting the ""Alice"" references). Unfortunately, this film seems to currently be unavailable in the US (it is available on DVD in Australia, however), which is a shame because this is a good film and a cut above your average pilot or made-for-television movie.",4,Above average pilot for a series that never was,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,1623,"['seemingly', 'chance', 'encounter', 'old', 'lady', 'results', 'architect', 'Michael', 'Lewis', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'developing', 'ability', 'see', 'communicate', 'dead', 'people', 'One', 'ghosts', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'serial', 'killer', 'Lewis', 'enlisted', 'solve', 'murder', 'can', 'rest', 'peace.This', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'Australian', 'television', 'lunch', 'time', 'movie', 'time-slot', 'not', 'exactly', 'renown', 'high', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'watched', 'solely', 'will', 'watch', 'just', 'anything', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'therefore', 'came', 'quite', 'surprise', 'when', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery', 'kept', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'fact', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'end', 'was', 'genuinely', 'disappointed', 'series', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'more.This', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'director', 'such', 'classics', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'interpret', 'information', 'whichever', 'way', 'choose', 'interesting', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'theme', 'think', 'meant', 'symbolize', 'Lewis', 'transition', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'so', 'speak', 'enjoyed', 'spotting', 'Alice', 'references', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'currently', 'be', 'unavailable', 'US', 'available', 'DVD', 'Australia', 'however', 'shame', 'good', 'film', 'cut', 'average', 'pilot', 'made-for-television', 'movie']",The Sight

After watching the DVD version without interruptions I found it very entertaining and well done.  The casting was really good with the character of Alice Cooper stealing much of the show for me, as children so often do. For those who enjoy this genre, i.e.  supernatural vision drama, this movie works well.  Like much of today's Hollywood production, the chase scenes at the conclusion were somewhat overdone but did not greatly detract from the story.  Being in England set a tone or mood in the movie that could only be achieved there.  Not a great movie, but really good entertainment  -  a movie that can be enjoyed by repeated viewings.",4,The Sight,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,756,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'program', 'was', 'interrupted', 'severe', 'weather', 'lost', 'much', 'story', 'line', 'watching', 'DVD', 'version', 'interruptions', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'well', 'done', 'casting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'stealing', 'much', 'show', 'children', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'who', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'i.e', 'supernatural', 'vision', 'drama', 'movie', 'well', 'much', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'chase', 'scenes', 'conclusion', 'were', 'somewhat', 'overdone', 'did', 'not', 'greatly', 'detract', 'story', 'Being', 'England', 'set', 'tone', 'mood', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'there', 'Not', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'repeated', 'viewings']",The Sight

Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and Event Horizon.  Although it might be tempting to compare this movie to THE SIXTH SENSE, they're really quite different.Andrew McCarthy, one of the Brat Pack, stars as an architect who is summoned to London to restore an old historic hotel.  While there, he accidentally runs over an elderly woman who has left her hospital and wanders the streets.  This lady (played with fervent tongue in cheek by Honor Blackman - the original Emma Peel and Pussy Galore in Goldfinger---informs McCarthy he is to take over her role as the ""advocate for the dead.""  He is gifted with ""the sight"" you see, so now he is to be the champion for several murdered children who want him to find the serial killer responsible.McCarthy gets good support from Kevin Tighe, Alexander Armstrong, Amanda Redman, Jessica Oyelowo, and Maurice Roeves.  Even though the plotting is at times ludicrous, Anderson weaves some spooky and atmospheric visuals, and the pace is brisk and involving.

It has a very Matrix-esque ending that makes you go, ""huh?"" However, the base mystery is very-well done about an American architect who is lured to England and finds out he has the dubious ""gift"" of speaking to the dead.The atmosphere is very spooky with plenty of jump-out-of-your-skin moments. There are also a couple of funny moments, but most of it moves along at a fairly quick pace as Michael Lewis must race to stop a serial killer before he strikes again. There's also the disconnect for Michael of not knowing if he's talking to a ghost or a live human. It leaves you guessing to the end as to the killer's identity.It's too bad that this never went any further.
