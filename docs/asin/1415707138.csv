169559,A2582KMXLK2P06,1415707138,B. E Jackson,"[3, 5]","Here's why NCIS is such a great show- as far as I know, it's the only show currently on television that is able to take a serious situation, combine it with humor, and make the story believable.  I believe that's the shows strongest point.  When watching an episode of this show, you care about the story, but at the same time you are able to care about Abby, Ducky and Tony because they provide distinct and enjoyable personalities and laughs.It's really cool in my opinion how the show is able to throw in some humor during a dangerous and critical situation the team might be going through, and have it all come across as, maybe not ""realistic"", but certainly more believable and interesting compared to other shows who try to do the same thing.  NCIS has really solid writing.The second greatest thing about NCIS is the great variety of personalities.  You have Abby, who's more than just a crazy gothic chick, she's also extremely smart and alert.  Every episode she finds a new way to amaze me with her overall fascinating weirdness.  She's STILL a really cool character right now, during Season 4.  You have the boss (named Gibbs) who's very demanding and always finds a way to get STRAIGHT to the point and immediately stop ANY humorous conversations that he happens to be overhearing from his workmates.  He's exactly what you'd expect from a boss.Tony is the guy who's supposedly a ladies man, and insists he can have any woman he wants (though he's starting to change and grow up in Season Four).  Ducky is the guy who examines dead peoples bodies, and he's always hilarious in a sort of mean-spirited way.  He talks to the bodies while he's examining them.  He's a really good character.  Many other characters on the show are memorable, also.  In fact, they all are.The point of the show is for these crime investigators to get together and find out how people have died, and it's great because when the show gets serious, and the characters gather all the clues they have at the moment and put the pieces together, you really get into the story.  At the same time, the genius writing team also implements humor during these parts, usually at the end of a scene before the next one comes in.  It's actually funny.  The show is serious AND funny and it *works*.How many crime investigation shows have you seen that can pull off seriousness *just* as well as humor?  Probably none.  That's what makes NCIS such a good show.  I hope it sticks around for years.

Unfortunately NCIS isn't free yet on Amazon Prime, so I purchased the DVD set (at &lt; $20, I'm willing to take a chance). I chose NCIS as my introduction to CSI franchise shows because Pauley Perrette's character seemed to have potential in providing ongoing appeal (a goth on network TV who isn't portrayed as a reject dunce? about time!)PROs+ the acting by Mark Harmon and Sasha Alexander is convincing+ Pauley Perrette's character is enticing and adds flavor to an otherwise bland serial (Ducky helps too)+ the austere character Gibbs is balanced out by the less jaded attitudes of the other protagonists+ exposure to bits of Navy/ Marine Corps culture (assuming that there is some degree of realism to the program in this arena) helps to keep the show from being too boring+ um... having trouble coming up with other pros... I like the music during the opening credits?CONs- Abby Sciuto is not a believable character, despite her glowing presence that steals the show. She would have about five PhDs to do her job as portrayed. ""Oh Gibbs, I can figure that out! I did one of my dissertations on different types of pine bark!"" I know people who work in white jackets in labs, and while they may be quite intelligent, they are not a Jack or Master of all sciences. Plus, while I like that NCIS is trying to portray a goth as capable and brainy, Abby is still a Hollywoodized version of a goth. But thanks for trying.- Gibbs walks around with a big stick up his you-know-what. Makes me wonder if Mark Harmon is like that IRL. I suppose it could be an effective trait for a lead investigator, but it's difficult to enjoy a serial in which the central character is off-putting.- I know this first season was aired only 2 years after 9/11, but really do we need a terrorist hiding under everyone's bed in every other episode? If there were as many terrorists in the U.S. as portrayed in this series, you wouldn't be able to go to the grocery store without brushing up against one.- Plot holes galore. I don't need to go into detail here since the 2-star review by C. Franz covers some of the blunders in NCIS season 1.- Something almost unbearable about Michael Weatherly's character Anthony DiNozzo, can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe he was funny 10 years ago or something.- The humor falls flat too often. I think this is partly because television has improved since 2003, but that may be giving NCIS too much credit. The back and forth between DiNozzo and Caitlin is already wearing thin by the end of the season. The trite dismissal of Ducky (whenever he speaks more than 3 sentences about something interesting) is predictable to the point of being annoying.Final verdict: 2.5 stars. I find the show ideal for falling asleep to at night (whereas good shows keep me awake too late because I want to see how the episodes end). This seems like a serial from the 1990s rather than the 21st century. So much for my experiment with CSI shows... they are no better than BONES, from what I can tell.",2,"dated and unrealistic, but watchable (barely)",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,3105,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'CSI', 'serial', 'purchasing', 'set', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'hoopla', 'was', 'about', 'Unfortunately', 'NCIS', ""n't"", 'free', 'yet', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'lt', '20', ""'m"", 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'chose', 'NCIS', 'introduction', 'CSI', 'franchise', 'shows', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'potential', 'providing', 'ongoing', 'appeal', 'goth', 'network', 'TV', 'who', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'reject', 'dunce', 'time', 'PROs+', 'acting', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'convincing+', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'character', 'enticing', 'flavor', 'otherwise', 'bland', 'serial', 'Ducky', 'too', 'austere', 'character', 'Gibbs', 'balanced', 'out', 'less', 'jaded', 'attitudes', 'other', 'protagonists+', 'exposure', 'bits', 'Navy/', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'culture', 'assuming', 'degree', 'realism', 'program', 'arena', 'keep', 'show', 'being', 'too', 'boring+', 'um', 'having', 'trouble', 'coming', 'up', 'other', 'pros', 'music', 'opening', 'credits', 'CONs-', 'Abby', 'Sciuto', 'not', 'believable', 'character', 'glowing', 'presence', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'about', 'five', 'PhDs', 'do', 'job', 'portrayed', 'Oh', 'Gibbs', 'can', 'figure', 'did', 'one', 'dissertations', 'different', 'types', 'pine', 'bark', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'white', 'jackets', 'labs', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'are', 'not', 'Jack', 'Master', 'sciences', 'like', 'NCIS', 'trying', 'portray', 'goth', 'capable', 'brainy', 'Abby', 'still', 'Hollywoodized', 'version', 'goth', 'thanks', 'trying.-', 'Gibbs', 'walks', 'big', 'stick', 'up', 'you-know-what', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'IRL', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'effective', 'trait', 'lead', 'investigator', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'serial', 'central', 'character', 'off-putting.-', 'know', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'aired', 'only', '2', 'years', '9/11', 'really', 'do', 'need', 'terrorist', 'hiding', 'everyone', 'bed', 'other', 'episode', 'were', 'many', 'terrorists', 'U.S.', 'portrayed', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'go', 'grocery', 'store', 'brushing', 'up', 'one.-', 'Plot', 'holes', 'galore', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'detail', 'here', '2-star', 'review', 'C.', 'Franz', 'blunders', 'NCIS', 'season', '1.-', 'Something', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'character', 'Anthony', 'DiNozzo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'Maybe', 'was', 'funny', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'something.-', 'humor', 'flat', 'too', 'often', 'think', 'partly', 'television', 'improved', '2003', 'may', 'be', 'giving', 'NCIS', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'back', 'forth', 'DiNozzo', 'Caitlin', 'already', 'wearing', 'thin', 'end', 'season', 'trite', 'dismissal', 'Ducky', 'whenever', 'more', '3', 'sentences', 'something', 'interesting', 'predictable', 'point', 'being', 'annoying.Final', 'verdict', '2.5', 'stars', 'find', 'show', 'ideal', 'falling', 'asleep', 'night', 'whereas', 'good', 'shows', 'keep', 'awake', 'too', 'late', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'episodes', 'end', 'serial', '1990s', 'rather', '21st', 'century', 'So', 'much', 'experiment', 'CSI', 'shows', 'are', 'better', 'BONES', 'what', 'can', 'tell']",N/A

However, there is only one episode (the Pilot) which has a commentary. While it is provided by the show's creator, Donald Bellisario, there are a number of great episodes in this season which I would find a commentary suitable. There are three short special features on the sixth disc, mainly dealing with the process of casting the characters and developing the show. Another significant flaw in my opinion is the lack of subtitles. The description of the set here on Amazon notes that the discs are subtitled, but this is not the case (neither the setup menu nor the subtitle button for my player gives the option). Also, to watch the episodes, you have to select each episode on the disc individually; there is no ""play all"" feature. I like to see the menu once only until I've seen the entirety of the shows on the disc.Still, the menus are not overdone with annoying transitions between screens like some movies and shows use, and the quality of the video is at least as good as the original broadcasts. I recommend the set for those who are fans of the show, but for those with hearing difficulties who want subtitles, this set won't suffice.",4,"Excellent show, DVD set could be better",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1583,"['writing', 'particular', 'superb', 'series', 'equally', 'great', 'acting', 'filmmaking', 'delivering', 'characters', 'who', 'start', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'possessed', 'depth', 'thickness', 'screen', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'lacking', 'regions.Given', 'someone', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'set', 'already', 'surely', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'praise', 'cast', 'creators', 'However', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Pilot', 'commentary', 'provided', 'show', 'creator', 'Donald', 'Bellisario', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'would', 'find', 'commentary', 'suitable', 'are', 'three', 'short', 'special', 'features', 'sixth', 'disc', 'mainly', 'dealing', 'process', 'casting', 'characters', 'developing', 'show', 'significant', 'flaw', 'opinion', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'description', 'set', 'here', 'Amazon', 'notes', 'discs', 'are', 'subtitled', 'not', 'case', 'setup', 'menu', 'subtitle', 'button', 'player', 'option', 'Also', 'watch', 'episodes', 'have', 'select', 'episode', 'disc', 'individually', 'play', 'feature', 'like', 'see', 'menu', 'once', 'only', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entirety', 'shows', 'disc.Still', 'menus', 'are', 'not', 'overdone', 'annoying', 'transitions', 'screens', 'movies', 'shows', 'use', 'quality', 'video', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'recommend', 'set', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'show', 'hearing', 'difficulties', 'who', 'want', 'subtitles', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'suffice']",N/A

169612,ASHS3J6EWUVUD,1415707138,K.M. Viglione,"[2, 2]","On televison, there are dozens of crime dramas. While none of them have the long-standing history of Law & Order, or the popularity of CSI, I've found that NCIS is one that has always managed to keep my interest and been much more enjoyable to watch. To this day, NCIS is the only crime drama I watch and TV, and I've never felt compelled to watch anything else in the genre.I've watched quite a bit of L&O;, and sat through a few episodes of CSI, but I've found them both boring, and at times, can really drag you down with the gritty realism, the dark crimes and hard lessons learned. It's why I don't often watch these shows; they get rather depressing. Don't make the mistake of thinking NCIS lacks these things. A horrible crime has taken place, and you can bet money it's going to be resolved, and rarely does the perp go unpunished. As the leading man, Mark Harmon as Gibbs is great. Gibbs isn't a nice guy, but he's 100% behind his team and is the best at what he does. When he assures a victim's family he's going to get justice, you can believe it's not false hope.Gibbs is just one example of the unique characters who blend the serious with the little things that give you a chuckle. Don't think that just because a character like Tony comes off as brash, immature, and a little girl crazy that he's not going to take his job seriously. A few lines of witty banter and the occasional smack on the back of the head doesn't detract from a serious story line. Rather it helps the viewer ""bond"" with this unique team. Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, can be sympathetic to a victim and courageous in the face of a dangerous opponent. As the new member of the team, she's a great way to help a viewer settle into this new way of investigating crimes.Another favorite character is Abby, the ""resident goth chick"" and forensics expert. Although Abby is a goth, it's nice to see she breaks the stereotype of the emo, depressed, obsessed with death goth. She's actually very bubbly and friendly, and I would certainly take the chance to throw on some black nail polish and platform boots to hang out with her in her scene for a night.While you may run into the normal run of murders and mysterious crimes that make up the bulk of crime drams, investigations are anything but ordinary. This first season takes viewers to a variety of locations, including on a submarine and an aircraft carrier to investigate crimes. While all crimes do involve military personnel, there are various twists and turns, and I enjoy trying to go through an episode figuring out the ""whodunnit"" part.With a fun cast of dynamic characters to enjoy, NCIS has more to offer than your average crime drama.",5,Something more than another crime drama,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2687,"['televison', 'are', 'dozens', 'crime', 'dramas', 'none', 'have', 'long-standing', 'history', 'Law', 'Order', 'popularity', 'CSI', ""'ve"", 'found', 'NCIS', 'one', 'always', 'managed', 'keep', 'interest', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'day', 'NCIS', 'only', 'crime', 'drama', 'watch', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'compelled', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'genre.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'quite', 'bit', 'L', 'O', 'sat', 'few', 'episodes', 'CSI', ""'ve"", 'found', 'boring', 'times', 'can', 'really', 'drag', 'down', 'gritty', 'realism', 'dark', 'crimes', 'hard', 'lessons', 'learned', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'watch', 'shows', 'get', 'rather', 'depressing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'NCIS', 'things', 'horrible', 'crime', 'taken', 'place', 'can', 'bet', 'money', 'going', 'be', 'resolved', 'rarely', 'perp', 'go', 'unpunished', 'leading', 'man', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Gibbs', 'great', 'Gibbs', ""n't"", 'nice', 'guy', '100', '%', 'team', 'best', 'what', 'When', 'victim', 'family', 'going', 'get', 'justice', 'can', 'believe', 'not', 'false', 'hope.Gibbs', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'unique', 'characters', 'who', 'blend', 'serious', 'little', 'things', 'give', 'chuckle', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'character', 'Tony', 'off', 'brash', 'immature', 'little', 'girl', 'crazy', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'job', 'seriously', 'A', 'few', 'lines', 'witty', 'banter', 'occasional', 'smack', 'back', 'head', ""n't"", 'detract', 'serious', 'story', 'line', 'viewer', 'bond', 'unique', 'team', 'Kate', 'Todd', 'played', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'can', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'victim', 'courageous', 'face', 'dangerous', 'opponent', 'new', 'member', 'team', 'great', 'way', 'help', 'viewer', 'settle', 'new', 'way', 'investigating', 'favorite', 'character', 'Abby', 'resident', 'goth', 'chick', 'forensics', 'expert', 'Abby', 'goth', 'nice', 'see', 'breaks', 'stereotype', 'emo', 'depressed', 'obsessed', 'death', 'goth', 'actually', 'very', 'bubbly', 'friendly', 'would', 'certainly', 'take', 'chance', 'throw', 'black', 'nail', 'polish', 'platform', 'boots', 'hang', 'out', 'scene', 'night.While', 'may', 'run', 'normal', 'run', 'murders', 'mysterious', 'crimes', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'crime', 'drams', 'investigations', 'are', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'first', 'season', 'viewers', 'variety', 'locations', 'including', 'submarine', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'investigate', 'crimes', 'crimes', 'do', 'involve', 'military', 'personnel', 'are', 'various', 'twists', 'turns', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'go', 'episode', 'figuring', 'out', 'whodunnit', 'fun', 'cast', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'NCIS', 'more', 'offer', 'average', 'crime', 'drama']",N/A

I bought Season 1 to see how it all started.The first episode shows Kate in her job as a Secret Service Agent on Airforce One.  During the episode, Gibbs makes a couple of references to the movie with Harrison Ford.  (Yes, Gibbs, not D'nozo.)McGee isn't yet a member of the team.  He appears as a guest in a few episodes.  Did you know McGee and Abby had a relationship?  Now, I know why Abby's toothbrush was at McGee's in Season 3.The first slap to the back of the head happens half way through the season.  And the calf-poww!  (I like to watch this show with a SuperBigGulp.)Kate's character grew on me, it makes me sadder, now, when I watch Season 3.  When she picks on D'nozo, he puts on a wounded puppy look.Ducky and Jared are regular characters.  This season doesn't include Ziva Daveed or Director Shepard, not even as an off screen reference.  But, it does show how the whole 'Ari' subplot developed.There is one goofy thing that happens to my DVD set, Disks 3, 4, and 5:When I press play for the first episode on the disk, for some reason, it plays the last episode on the disk.  To get the first episode to play, I start the second episode, and then as soon as it starts, I press Search previous twice.

Support your ...","[6, 6]","I thought I saw all of Season 1, but after looking through these discs, I realized that there were a few shows that I must have missed.  NCIS was first seen as a subset of characters on JAG for two episodes.  The characters had a much colder demeanor in JAG than in this dedicated show, where the audience can see the true colors of the NCIS team.NCIS provides a wonderful blend of different shows, while still remaining unique in their specific law enforcement field.  NCIS has some close ties with JAG (also another Bellisario production), but it could not properly be described without mentioning that NCIS also appears to have parts of Nash Bridges (another CBS production, now only seen as reruns on USA) and CSI blended in as well.  The humor between  characters can most certainly be described to parallel JAG and Nash Bridges.  There is a unique bond to say the least between Special Agent Gibbs and his team members. Gibbs is stearn and strictly business when on the job while other members of his investigation team find humor playfully at each other's expence or even regarding Agent Gibbs.  However, Gibbs's stearn nature can also provide good entertainment for the audience as well.  The forensic aspects in each show do not go as deep as CSI, but there is some science behind the evidence.  It's not an uptight show that only shows the characters working to ""get their man.""  A believeable story with the provided humor makes for an enjoyable episode.The DVDs work fine, the only problem is that they constantly startup in Spanish, which can throw you off each time you start an episode before",4,NCIS: A humorous crime show that's still enjoyable,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,1607,"['thought', 'saw', 'Season', '1', 'looking', 'discs', 'realized', 'were', 'few', 'shows', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'NCIS', 'was', 'first', 'seen', 'subset', 'characters', 'JAG', 'two', 'episodes', 'characters', 'had', 'much', 'colder', 'demeanor', 'JAG', 'dedicated', 'show', 'where', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'true', 'colors', 'NCIS', 'team.NCIS', 'wonderful', 'blend', 'different', 'shows', 'still', 'remaining', 'unique', 'specific', 'law', 'enforcement', 'field', 'NCIS', 'close', 'ties', 'JAG', 'also', 'Bellisario', 'production', 'could', 'not', 'properly', 'be', 'described', 'mentioning', 'NCIS', 'also', 'have', 'parts', 'Nash', 'Bridges', 'CBS', 'production', 'now', 'only', 'seen', 'reruns', 'USA', 'CSI', 'blended', 'as', 'well', 'humor', 'characters', 'can', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'described', 'parallel', 'JAG', 'Nash', 'Bridges', 'unique', 'bond', 'say', 'least', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Gibbs', 'team', 'members', 'Gibbs', 'stearn', 'strictly', 'business', 'when', 'job', 'other', 'members', 'investigation', 'team', 'find', 'humor', 'playfully', 'other', 'expence', 'even', 'regarding', 'Agent', 'Gibbs', 'However', 'Gibbs', 'stearn', 'nature', 'can', 'also', 'provide', 'good', 'entertainment', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'forensic', 'aspects', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'deep', 'CSI', 'science', 'evidence', 'not', 'uptight', 'show', 'only', 'characters', 'working', 'get', 'man', 'believeable', 'story', 'provided', 'humor', 'enjoyable', 'episode.The', 'DVDs', 'work', 'fine', 'only', 'problem', 'constantly', 'startup', 'Spanish', 'can', 'throw', 'off', 'time', 'start', 'episode']",N/A

Each actor is well-suited to his/her role and does a more-than-excellent job portraying their character. Each character has depth and plays well off their counterpart. Case in point is Tony DiNozzo vs. Kate Todd--the writers really captured DiNozzo's Italian cultural idiosyncrasies: outgoing, price as a value system, constant snooping, and male machismo--""The Babe Hound"". All these together ARE Tony DiNozzo. You'll also enjoy the brother-sister relationship he has with the reserved Kate Todd, ex-body guard to the President of the United States, and winner of a wet T-shirt contest during her college days. DiNozzo also plays off Tim McGee aka ""McGeek"", who, as time progresses, learns to overcome Tony's ""charisma"", especially after his book-""loosely based on the team""-is published.Now it only makes sense that Abby and McGee team up, the former a field forensics scientist, the latter an MIT computer forensics specialist. The Goth vs Geek attraction is also a nice touch, one hinting at a future romance.The last pair of ""opposites"" are Gibbs and ""Ducky""--Dr. Mallard. Gibbs,a highly decorated ex-Marine and winner of the Silver Star, is focused, driven, a ""non-techi"", whose painful history includes a murdered wife and daughter, two failed marriages, and a tour of duty in Iraq where he was awarded the Purple Heart. ""Ducky"", on the other hand, revels in history, almost to the point of distraction. He is amiable, concerned with relationships--so much so, that he talks to his dead patients.The only part of the show I find over-exaggerated is the phenomenal amounts of caffeine consumed by Gibbs and Abby.

I've enjoyed the program immensely, and with the DVD releases of Seasons One and Two, I have been able to do some catching up watching the show's earlier episodes.The series follows a team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which handles crimes connected to personnel of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, ranging from murder and kidnapping to espionage and terrorism.  Created by Donald Bellasario (Quantum Leap, JAG), NCIS originally began as a two-part episode of JAG in the spring of 2003.  The program then debuted on CBS as a stand-alone series in September of that same year.Mark Harmon stars as special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, an ex-marine turned investigator, who is the no-nonsense leader of this team of investigators.  Gibbs' teammates include former Secret Service agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), special agent and former homicide detective Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), forensics expert/goth chick Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) and Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum, best remembered as The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Ilya Kuryakin), a quirky medical examiner.  Sean Murray debuts about six episodes into the season as rookie agent Tim McGee, and has a recurring role throughout the season.  McGee becomes a regular character during the second season.The writers and producers consult with agents from the real-life Naval Criminal Investigative Service to maintain realistic storylines.  The show's mix of clever writing and great acting makes for consistently entertaining TV.  NCIS has often been described as a mix of CSI and JAG, but the show has developed its own identity to separate it from other ""forensic TV"" programs.  I'm a CSI fan, and of all the forensic shows that have followed the original, I'd have to say NCIS has become my favorite.The first season DVD set includes all twenty-three episodes of Season One, plus three 20-minute featurettes--""NCIS: Creating Season 1,"" ""NCIS: Building the Team"" and ""NCIS: Defining the Look""--which offer an exciting look behind the creation of the series and how it came together.

While the characters were introduced on JAG, the term ""spin-off"" I didn't think appropriate for it.  For those who have seen many of the Bellisarius productions, they seem to swing between emphasis on interpersonal relationships (Magnum, Quantum Leap) and strongly patriotic vehicles (Airwolf, JAG), with the shows having the better developed characters being the stronger shows.This is why--and Don Bellisario backs this up in interviews--NCIS seems to lean more towards Magnum in terms of of how the characters react towards one another, and the quirks that play out with them.  Mark Harmon's Gibbs--the lead investigator; doesn't work well with authority or other agencies (or his ex-wives), coffee-addicted, carving a boat in his basement, and known for his ""mysterious redhead"" companion.  Michael Weatherly's DiNozzo--the jock who won't grow up, making a pass at anything with a skirt.  Sasha Alexander's Kate--in an homage to ""Moonlighting"", becoming Maddie to DiNozzo's David; while being the mature and smarter part of that combination.  Sean Murray's Tim McGee--yeah, he's the computer nerd.  But women are seeing SOMETHING in him.  Especially Abby.  Which brings us to Pauley, Pauley, Pauley--Miss Perette takes our classic concept of a Goth chick and throws it out the window in a spectacular fashion, with her peppiness and her open attraction for the men in the office.  It is David McCallum though that really brings the Magnum memory into clear relief.  Think about John Hillerman's Jonathan Higgins on Magnum--know it all because he's seen it all.  Put him in a lab coat and give him more and lighter hair, and we have Ducky Mallard.Clearly, NCIS isn't JAG, and it certainly isn't even close to being related to the CSI franchise.  There's a fun in the drama that plays out in every episode that leaves the viewer giggling while anticipating the action, and that's what makes the Season 1 set so entertaining.",5,The Surprise Of NCIS,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2028,"['recently', 'got', 'hooked', 'series', 'found', 'studying', 'history', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'JAG', 'term', 'spin-off', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'appropriate', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'Bellisarius', 'productions', 'seem', 'swing', 'emphasis', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'Magnum', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'strongly', 'patriotic', 'vehicles', 'Airwolf', 'JAG', 'shows', 'having', 'better', 'developed', 'characters', 'being', 'stronger', 'shows.This', 'why', 'Don', 'Bellisario', 'up', 'interviews', 'NCIS', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'Magnum', 'terms', 'how', 'characters', 'react', 'one', 'quirks', 'play', 'out', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Gibbs', 'lead', 'investigator', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'authority', 'other', 'agencies', 'ex-wives', 'coffee-addicted', 'carving', 'boat', 'basement', 'known', 'mysterious', 'redhead', 'companion', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'DiNozzo', 'jock', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'making', 'pass', 'anything', 'skirt', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'Kate', 'homage', 'Moonlighting', 'becoming', 'Maddie', 'DiNozzo', 'David', 'being', 'mature', 'smarter', 'part', 'combination', 'Sean', 'Murray', 'Tim', 'McGee', 'yeah', 'computer', 'nerd', 'women', 'are', 'seeing', 'SOMETHING', 'Especially', 'Abby', 'Which', 'Pauley', 'Pauley', 'Pauley', 'Miss', 'Perette', 'classic', 'concept', 'Goth', 'chick', 'out', 'window', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'peppiness', 'open', 'attraction', 'men', 'office', 'David', 'McCallum', 'really', 'Magnum', 'memory', 'clear', 'relief', 'Think', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'Jonathan', 'Higgins', 'Magnum', 'know', 'seen', 'Put', 'lab', 'coat', 'give', 'more', 'lighter', 'hair', 'have', 'Ducky', 'Mallard.Clearly', 'NCIS', ""n't"", 'JAG', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'being', 'related', 'CSI', 'franchise', 'fun', 'drama', 'out', 'episode', 'viewer', 'giggling', 'anticipating', 'action', 'what', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'so', 'entertaining']",N/A
