499764,A2810VIARHKGSD,B00000F8KW,Cato,"[1, 2]","I agree with most other reviews that this is some of Swayze's best work.  This is an all around good show..good writing, awesome camera work and lighting (love the high contrast desaturated pallete), and great acting........up until the last episode.  The characters are all interesting, multi-dimensional, and you never know who is on what ""side"" or if there even is a ""side"" or just differing personal agendas.  However, everything falls apart in the last episode.I wish they would have just ended the series at the ""to be continued"" mark on the second to last show.  The last episode is just really poor quality.  The script on the last episode is nonsensical and the entire episode feels rushed and feels like they patched together a bunch of scenes they filmed with different endings in mind.  The whole plotline with the ""girl"" makes little sense and the set up for the final reveal is poorly executed and entirely predictable.  Scenes are inconsistent with each other and do not ""flow.""  The acting is also relatively poor on the last episode, as well as the camera work and audio....it looks like a series of screen tests and rought takes with little post-production work other than adding the show's soundtrack to certain spots.  Background street audio is audible where it otherwise would not be.  Actors seems to be reciting ""stock"" lines with little or no emotion.....  At certain points you wonder if you are really watching ""behind the scenes"" footage rather than a polished final product.  Given the quality of the other episodes, the last one was a let down.That said, this is one of those shows where if you have some free time, you will find yourself watching ""just one more"" episode.  The show pulls you in and keeps you on the edge and guessing.  Overall great product.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the last episode.",4,Great show..poor ending,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,1840,"['agree', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'Swayze', 'best', 'work', 'all', 'around', 'good', 'show..good', 'writing', 'awesome', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'high', 'contrast', 'desaturated', 'pallete', 'great', 'acting', '..up', 'last', 'episode', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'multi-dimensional', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'side', 'even', 'side', 'just', 'differing', 'personal', 'agendas', 'However', 'everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'last', 'episode.I', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'ended', 'series', 'be', 'continued', 'mark', 'second', 'last', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'just', 'really', 'poor', 'quality', 'script', 'last', 'episode', 'nonsensical', 'entire', 'episode', 'feels', 'rushed', 'feels', 'patched', 'together', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'different', 'endings', 'mind', 'whole', 'plotline', 'girl', 'little', 'sense', 'set', 'up', 'final', 'reveal', 'poorly', 'executed', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Scenes', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'other', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'acting', 'also', 'relatively', 'poor', 'last', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'camera', 'work', 'audio', '.it', 'looks', 'series', 'screen', 'tests', 'rought', 'little', 'post-production', 'work', 'other', 'adding', 'show', 'soundtrack', 'certain', 'spots', 'Background', 'street', 'audio', 'audible', 'where', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Actors', 'be', 'reciting', 'stock', 'lines', 'little', 'emotion', '..', 'certain', 'points', 'wonder', 'are', 'really', 'watching', 'scenes', 'footage', 'rather', 'polished', 'final', 'product', 'Given', 'quality', 'other', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'let', 'said', 'one', 'shows', 'where', 'have', 'free', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'watching', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'episode', 'show', 'keeps', 'edge', 'guessing', 'Overall', 'great', 'product', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'last', 'episode']",The Beast: Season 1

There is not a lot of bonus material with Patrick Swayze for obvious reasons. His work on this remains like all his previous work- perfect. He was an incredible actor and it amazes me that he worked on this series while he battled pancreatic cancer. The show's characters and sub-plots are interesting while also keeping in line with the central story arc of the season: is he a rogue FBI agent or not? This is a great story and Swayze should've earned some awards or at least some nominations for his role as the troubled FBI agent. There are many labels one could attach to his character, but he was, unfortunately, not allowed enough time to evolve. Like the actor who portrayed him, he was gone too soon...

The two Agents are fearless, lethal, and completely dettached from the 'real world' in order to do their jobs and that's what makes them so compelling to watch.At the end of the show when you've really formed an attachment to the characters you realize the show is not only not on anymore, but the driving force behind it in Patrick Swayze, is no longer with us.

499780,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00000F8KW,Mark Turner,"[25, 25]","It wasn't long ago that the world was made aware of Patrick Swayze's battle with cancer. Once made public, everyone speculated that he would never act again. Thank goodness someone had the decency to side up with Swayze and give him the chance with the TV show THE BEAST.Swayze stars as FBI undercover agent Charles Barker. Barker is an agent who gets the job done no matter what it takes. If the rules need bent a little then so be it. But the scum of the Earth are the villains he tracks down and Barker makes no bones about the way he thinks they should be handled.As the series begins we are also introduced to Ellis Dove (Travis Fimmell), a young agent just starting out in the undercover world. Ellis is being trained by Barker and Barker doesn't go easy on him. Within minutes of the shows start, he actually shoots him in the chest...twice! Sure, he's wearing a Kevlar vest but it can't feel good. Truth be told, Ellis was about to blow his cover which would have resulted in his death. The 2 shots may have hurt but in the long run they saved his life and provided a needed lesson.The difference between the two men is obvious. Where Barker is world weary and battle scarred, a man who knows his way around the technicalities of the law and who knows how to get his man, Ellis is fresh and new. It shows in his actions and the way he looks at the job. Its showdown time with each new assignment and he's ready for action. But that attitude can get you killed rather than the job done. It will take Barker to reign in Ellis and train him so that he doesn't get himself or his partner killed.The initial episode finds the pair searching for missiles on American soil. But it's not just the missiles that they want. They want the man behind it all, the one buying the missiles so they can take him off the street and put him away. Each clue leads them to this man but it isn't until the show's end he is captured.But it doesn't end there. On his way home, Ellis is met on the subway by several of the suspects he met along the way on this mission, one of which he even smoked crack with to form his cover. It turns out these are another set of FBI agents and they have an ulterior motive for approaching Ellis. It seems that Barker may have gone too far and might be involved in doing more harm than good. This group wants Ellis to go undercover as an undercover agent to get the goods on Barker.With each subsequent episode, Ellis deals with the idea that maybe Barker isn't all right. That maybe he is what they say. And each episode presents him with proof provided by this group to make him see their way. This does nothing more than create a world of deceit and stress for Ellis as he tries to decide the right thing to do.But then again are these agents really doing what they claim? Or is there something else behind their motives when it comes to Barker? Who can trust whom here? The answers won't be easy and won't come too fast. Hey, if they did what kind of show would that leave you?Swayze does a fine job portraying the grizzled old vet who's teaching the new kid the ropes. Where he once starred as the fresh faced romantic lead, he's taken on a leaner meaner look, no doubt brought on by his problems in the real world. But it works and helps him cement the feel of the character.Fimmell matches Swayze scene for scene, coming off as the fresh faced rookie who is just getting the hang of things. Toss in some personal problems for them both and the show builds the depth required to make these characters ones we can feel for.Rather than make a prolonged sting operation as real life would hand them (some agents go undercover for months at a time, some years), the show presents us with a different situation each week. Be it kidnapping or weapons dealing, these agents are out to protect the world at all costs.The show offers the correct blend of drama and action, suspense and intrigue.

Surprisingly good, despite some new comers and a gritty underbelly.  I believe this is the last work Patrick Swayze did, before his death from cancer, September 14, 2009.Mr. Swayze made his acting debut in the 1983 movie 'The Outsiders' directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which also starred several other beginners, including Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, and Matt Dillon among others.  For those interested in more about Mr. Swayze, his book is coming out September 29, 2009, aptly titled 'The Time of My Life'.The show, Season 1, which contains thirteen episodes, originally aired on January 15, 2009, on the A&E; Channel, is about a veteran FBI agent (Swayze) who gets a new partner (Travis Fimmel), and is not too excited about it.  The new 'wet behind the ears' partner soon learns that his veteran partner is probably working on both sides of the fence (legal and illegal) and has to decide what to do when he gets approached to spy and rat on him (Swayze).Great story, great troubled characters, some incredible action scenes, smart and fun dialogue, nice set design.  I was truly amazed on how good it was.Unfortunately, there is only one season.  The show got canceled due to concerns about Mr. Swayze's health issues (pancreatic cancer).  It's a loss to those of us that came to love the series.Update:While I didn't like that they canceled show, because I loved it so much, I'm glad they did now, so Mr. Swayze could have that time with family and friends before he passed on.
