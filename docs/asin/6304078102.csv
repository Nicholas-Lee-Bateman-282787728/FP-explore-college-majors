How does one juggle all of the piles of responsibility one is given, and how does one rise above the fray to achieve greatness?  With many hurdles to overcome, Glenn Holland (in an extraordinary performance by Richard Dreyfuss) comes to Portland's Kennedy High School with the aspiration of employment filler with enough free time to compose his own music.  Naive about the demands for extra-curriculars and student tutoring, Glenn, nevertheless, must reinvent the wheel and learn to accomodate his students by taking risks to win their love for music.  Locking heads with the vice principal (played with perfect starchy officiousness by William Macy), he nearly loses his job and composure.  At home his loving, understanding wife will stand by him, but plausibly loses patience when their own beloved son (who was born deaf) gets the shaft on some quality mentor time.  Feeling his pain, we also are absorbed in the lives of key students (in fine early performances by Terrence Howard and [Forrest] Whitaker to name a couple).  He gets reprieves with the football coach (Jay Thomas) who offers friendship and a spirited rivalry.  With a rising starlet at his school and the soundtrack of their lives evolving to John Lennon, the poignancy of a man who has painted himself into a corner comes to roost.'Mr. Holland's Opus' is as realistic as it is an emotional dead ringer.  Admittedly, I prejudged this movie on the notion that it would be facile, cloying, or overly sentimental.

Some films shamelessly work that at every corner and overdo it to no end.  For me, &#8216;Mr. Holland&#8217;s Opus&#8217;, while obviously going for it, works because it all feels so human, honest and balanced.While the rest of the world ate up &#8216;The Dead Poets Society&#8217;, I was unmoved and rather cold towards it, and yet this is probably my equivalent to that particular film.One thing that always got me with this film, and the thing that, in my eyes, sets it apart from most in the genre, is that the portrayal of Glenn Holland is extremely honest.  It doesn&#8217;t paint him as some martyr, some unblemished soul with the heart of gold who inspires unabashedly and is pure to the bone.  Holland is an emotional mess (not in the theatrical sense) and has severe issues.  Yes, there are the dramatic familial matters (a deaf son) and the professional issues (trouble with the school budget) but at the heart of Holland is a man who is conflicted and distraught and someone who is making some seriously misguided decisions.But, above all that, this is the story of one man&#8217;s love for music and the power that that love can have on a person.  Through this man&#8217;s struggle, we see how his devotion to his craft makes him a tortured artist as well as a tortured family man, but also a remarkable talent and a teacher with a real gift and real love for that gift in others.Richard Dreyfuss is remarkable here.  In fact, this is one of those layered and just outright beautiful performances that makes it hard for me to understand how others can see this.  I&#8217;ve heard many balk at his Oscar nom, like it wasn&#8217;t worthy, but in my eyes he&#8217;ll always be a deserving force.  The way he handles each layer of this man is outstanding and so detailed, never overbearing or overwrought.  He gets it all just right.  Glenne Headly is also very good here.The genre has been done, redone and done again (the whole teacher/student formula) but this is one that is done better than most and adds layers that the others don&#8217;t, taking it a step further and giving us a complete picture that we can love.",5,For the love of music&#8230;,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2336,"['Love', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'common', 'cinephile', 'community', 'community', 'can', 'be', 'unfairly', 'harsh', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'films', 'are', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'jugular', 'intend', 'make', 'cry', 'films', 'shamelessly', 'work', 'corner', 'overdo', 'end', '8216', 'Mr.', 'Holland', '8217', 'Opus', '8217', 'obviously', 'going', 'feels', 'so', 'human', 'honest', 'rest', 'world', 'ate', 'up', '8216', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', '8217', 'was', 'unmoved', 'rather', 'cold', 'towards', 'yet', 'probably', 'equivalent', 'particular', 'film.One', 'thing', 'always', 'got', 'film', 'thing', 'eyes', 'apart', 'most', 'genre', 'portrayal', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'extremely', 'honest', '8217', 'paint', 'martyr', 'unblemished', 'soul', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'unabashedly', 'pure', 'bone', 'Holland', 'emotional', 'mess', 'not', 'theatrical', 'sense', 'severe', 'issues', 'Yes', 'are', 'dramatic', 'familial', 'matters', 'deaf', 'son', 'professional', 'issues', 'trouble', 'school', 'budget', 'heart', 'Holland', 'man', 'who', 'conflicted', 'distraught', 'someone', 'who', 'making', 'seriously', 'misguided', 'decisions.But', 'story', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'love', 'music', 'power', 'love', 'can', 'have', 'person', 'man', '8217', 'struggle', 'see', 'how', 'devotion', 'craft', 'tortured', 'artist', 'as', 'well', 'tortured', 'family', 'man', 'also', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'teacher', 'real', 'gift', 'real', 'love', 'gift', 'others.Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'remarkable', 'here', 'fact', 'one', 'layered', 'just', 'outright', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'others', 'can', 'see', '8217', 'heard', 'many', 'balk', 'Oscar', 'nom', '8217', 'worthy', 'eyes', '8217', 'always', 'be', 'deserving', 'force', 'way', 'layer', 'man', 'outstanding', 'so', 'detailed', 'never', 'overbearing', 'overwrought', 'just', 'right', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here.The', 'genre', 'been', 'done', 'redone', 'done', 'again', 'whole', 'teacher/student', 'formula', 'one', 'done', 'better', 'most', 'layers', 'others', 'don', '8217', 't', 'taking', 'step', 'further', 'giving', 'complete', 'picture', 'can', 'love']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

And what's more, his sweet, sweet little wifey-wife also seems to be blissfully unaware of the fact her beloved, devoted husband had messed around a bit with some long-maned vixen who had came to him for advice in singing and eventually became a successful singer headed for New York, all thanks to his unselfish urging and support. And he gets to kiss her thick, luscious quivering lips in sincere gratitude. How sweet! And in the very end, all the devotion and obsession the &quot;hero&quot; has for music (he's afraid the whole civilization will come to an end if it doesn't maintain its interest in classical music) all comes down to his very last waving of a stick before a musical group of students who had been in his classes a long ago before he retires forever.

On January 19, 1996 it opened in theaters across the country and people gave it a standing ovation at the theater where I saw it.  This movie set a precedent for me -- I saw it 5  times in the theater, something I have never done before.  I REALLY LOVE  IT.The movie starts out in the 1964-1965 school year.  Mr. Glen Holland  (Richard Dreyfus) plays a musician forced to table his musical career for  economic reasons.  His wife is pregnant and he has to find stable work.  An  opening for a music teacher at the former Grant High School (now Kennedy)  in Oregon has become available.  Mr. Holland applies for and gets the  job.Reluctant to put his dream on the back burner, Mr. Holland enters  the classroom.  He is confronted with an array of students ranging from  naturally talented to tone deaf.  After initially getting nowhere with his  pupils, Mr. Holland tries a new approach.  He encourages them to talk about  the music they like and uses this as a way of establishing an interest in  music.  One young clarinetist catches his attention and he works 1x1 with  the girl, extracting hard work and talent for her.  He helps her find her  voice. He tells her that he can &quot;teach her music and notes on the  page,&quot; but as for &quot;all that other stuff,&quot; he cannot teach.  It has to be felt.  ....The movie does an excellent  and convincing job of covering a three-decade time span.  One of my  favorite scenes was when Mr. Holland borrowed the Driver's Ed class' 1965  Dodge Coronet (an especially cool car) and drove it like the proverbial bat  ...The movie is really about love.  Love for music, love for  people and love for the best people have to offer.  The high school coach  who befriends Mr. Holland early in his teaching career helps him work with  his pupils in marching band drills.  The coach also helps the  administration continue their tradition of hosting school shows....I really love this movie.  I  even bought the tape.

He does not earn enough money to continue supporting himself and his wife Iris (Glenne Headly) in this manner, transitions into survival mode and takes a job as a high school music teacher under the guidance and encouragement of a female principal (Olympia Dukakis).  He plunges into his new job with courage and determination, but without previous teaching experience.  This shortfall soon becomes obvious as he forcefully tries to impart music theory into his student's minds with lectures plus question and answer sessions and perfect their performance techniques with classical music drills based on trial and error.  These methods create tension and boredom among his students along with loss of faith in their instructor.  Mr. Holland realizes that he is going down the wrong road and the students are not having fun.  He scraps his failing methods and begins to use rock music examples to illustrate the points he needs to make.  His students light up, start smiling, digging in and catching on.  During the buildup to the movie's end, Mr. Holland continues to compose and eventually finishes the symphony he always wanted to create.  The movie plays down Mr. Holland's work on the symphony, leaving the audience free to forget about it as other events distract the audience.  The audience also is distracted, saddened and irritated by seemingly irrelevant material placed before the movie's end to condition them for the final uplift.  The final scene is a huge reunion involving Mr. Holland and the music students who were taught by him over a thirty-year interval.  It includes a stirring first performance of his symphony.  The result is dramatic enough to drive reasonably sensitive members of the audience into huge spasms of tearful joy.",5,"Richard Dreyfuss Turns In A Virtuoso Performance In An Uplifting Movie To Laugh, Cry And Talk About Forever",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1922,"['movie', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'man', 'musical', 'talent', 'who', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'pianist', 'dreaming', 'creating', 'world-class', 'symphony', 'not', 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'continue', 'supporting', 'wife', 'Iris', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'manner', 'transitions', 'survival', 'mode', 'job', 'high', 'school', 'music', 'teacher', 'guidance', 'encouragement', 'female', 'principal', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'new', 'job', 'courage', 'determination', 'previous', 'teaching', 'experience', 'shortfall', 'soon', 'becomes', 'obvious', 'forcefully', 'impart', 'music', 'theory', 'student', 'minds', 'lectures', 'question', 'answer', 'sessions', 'perfect', 'performance', 'techniques', 'classical', 'music', 'drills', 'based', 'trial', 'error', 'methods', 'create', 'tension', 'boredom', 'students', 'loss', 'faith', 'instructor', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'going', 'down', 'wrong', 'road', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'having', 'fun', 'scraps', 'failing', 'methods', 'begins', 'use', 'rock', 'music', 'illustrate', 'points', 'make', 'students', 'light', 'up', 'start', 'smiling', 'digging', 'catching', 'buildup', 'movie', 'end', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'compose', 'eventually', 'symphony', 'always', 'wanted', 'create', 'movie', 'down', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'work', 'symphony', 'leaving', 'audience', 'free', 'forget', 'about', 'other', 'events', 'distract', 'audience', 'audience', 'also', 'distracted', 'saddened', 'irritated', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'material', 'placed', 'movie', 'end', 'condition', 'final', 'uplift', 'final', 'scene', 'huge', 'reunion', 'involving', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'music', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'taught', 'thirty-year', 'interval', 'stirring', 'first', 'performance', 'symphony', 'result', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'drive', 'reasonably', 'sensitive', 'members', 'audience', 'huge', 'spasms', 'tearful', 'joy']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

I can honestly say that the threat of budget cuts and loss of arts programs is a very real fear that we live with from year to year.  We have more work than any other teacher and, in many cases, less respect.  Mr. Holland's plight is not terribly exaggerated.  Furthermore, his effect on his students is not exaggerated either.  I haven't been teaching long enough to have that much impact on my students (one semester of student teaching doesn't really change lives), but I have watched enough music teachers to know that they have a profound influence on students.  The concepts in this movie are certainly not made up.This movie is beautiful, and shows not only Mr. Holland's virtues, but his flaws as well -- and how he overcomes them.  No one likes the idea of a teacher falling for his beautiful student.  No one likes the idea of a father avoiding his son simply because he is deaf.

It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son.The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt, who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor; Terrence Howard, a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam, and Jean Louisa Kelly, the last and most memorable student perhaps, an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.Interwoven are some personal stories, particularly with Kelly's character, and with fellow teachers (Jay Thomas playing the most likable) and school administrators (Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy). The most personal, of course, involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son (played by three different actors as time passes.) Glenne Headly, meanwhile, plays Dreyfuss' wife.As you can see by this cast, this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable - as Hollywood seems to be - to control their political bias by giving us unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts. In addition, atheist John Lennon is almost deified in this film as one of the ""heroes"" of the 20th century, plus there are a few more digs and plugs here and there, all with the normal Liberal bias. Gee, why couldn't they just stick the story?The movie seems to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative, but it works.

In general, Mr. Holland (played fairly well by Richard Dreyfuss) is portrayed as a passionate music teacher and an inspiration to his students. But, the truth is that he is a bad father, who only takes an interest in his son's life when his son is an adult. He is beligerent to anyone who doesn't share his vision. He has a flirtatious relationship with an 18-year-old singing starlet, even writing a song for her. And the symphony he finally writes is just a generic musak piece, with no passion or feeling. There is nothing unique or outstanding about Mr. Holland... either his life or his story. Still, it is touching and enjoyable, for the most part.

Most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers, teachers that can do no wrong.  Here, we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome isn't always the best.  He's a man who knows how to do one thing, and that one thing he does so well, but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one's he loves the most.  Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss in a career best) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills.  His wife (Glenne Headley) is supportive, yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change.  Their relationship is tried as Glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who can't share his love of music is killing him.  Glenn is a very flawed man, but he has a very big heart and that's why this film works so well.  When Glenn starts to fall in love with a student you don't hate him as much as you feel bad for him.  He's far from a bad man, he's just a man.  This is truly one of the most touching, inspirational and blessed movies I've ever seen.  It's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time I watch it.

Glenn of course isn't writing his OWN music, but doing something for school.  Everyone who has ever taught can relate to this moment, since teachers work some insane hours (most work more in 9 months than others work in an entire year), yet often aren't recognized for this.

Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a young high school music teacher and aspiring composer, whose goal is to compose an original musical piece.  He must take on a more stable teaching job, to support himself and his pregnant wife Iris (Glenne Headly).  The film follows him from his humble beginnings, as a musical teacher, guiding a group of naturally gifted, disabled and difficult students.  Holland transforms these young people and encourages them to pursue their budding ablities as musicians.  I don't want to reveal too many plot points because I don't want to ruin the movie for you.What works so well is the combination of great direction by Stephen Herek, wonderful acting and a great musical score by Michael Kamen.

It follows a rather predictable path, and the script relies too heavily on coincidences (such as the music-teacher having a deaf son) rather than character depth to make its point.  However, it was genuinely entertaining and not too far over the top to watch again.The back of the DVD case provides an ample summary of the plot:&quot;(Mr. Holland) accepts a 'day job' as a high school music teacher... In time, however, Mr. Holland realizes that his real passion is teaching...&quot;Coming myself from Oregon, where the film was set (and filmed), I was able to feel a great deal of empathy for the budget cut issues raised in the latter part of the film.  The resulting cut of the art and music programs in the state actually occurred there, during the time when I was a student.  It has been mentioned that, perhaps, the ending was not as bright as it could have been.  However, it successfully portrayed a real problem in the modern American school system.  There's no doubt about the message this is trying to send.  Subtlety isn't a part of the film's charm.I actually felt that most of the scenes have relevance.  The scene of the funeral for the boy killed in Vietnam was a stock moment, but at least it was mercifully brief and tasteful, rather than pouring on hokey dialogue.  It allowed Mr. Holland to make a tired point to a stoner in his class, and prove his excellent and influential teaching methods by the end of the film.The encounter Mr. Holland had with a young singer in his school play who fell in love with him did actually add to the story.  She makes the point that he could come with her to New York and pursue the dreams he always had (and gave up when he had a child, bought a house, etc).  From the expression on Dreyfuss' face, the viewer can see that she has had an impact- that he perhaps hadn't even noticed until then that he had been simply marking time in his life, expecting it to be different &quot;some day&quot;.  In the very song Mr. Holland sings for his son, there is the line &quot;life is what happens while you're busy making other plans&quot;, and the scene with the singer is when he realizes that for himself.  In short, it's the character's catharsis scene- when he decides that he's actually pleased with what he has done, and what he is doing.All this has been done before.  There's really nothing original to be found in the script or the characters.  &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot; is simply a fairly well-done telling of a common tale.  What makes it tolerable and, even, enjoyable, is that it mostly manages to steer clear of silly or unrealistic dialogue, even in its more overly melodramatic scenes.",4,A Decent Film,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,2700,"['movie', 'set', 'up', 'pin', 'knocked', 'down', 'rather', 'predictable', 'path', 'script', 'too', 'heavily', 'coincidences', 'such', 'music-teacher', 'having', 'deaf', 'son', 'rather', 'character', 'depth', 'make', 'point', 'However', 'was', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'watch', 'again.The', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'ample', 'summary', 'plot', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Holland', ""'day"", 'job', 'high', 'school', 'music', 'teacher', 'time', 'however', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'real', 'passion', 'teaching', 'quot', 'Coming', 'Oregon', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'filmed', 'was', 'able', 'feel', 'great', 'deal', 'empathy', 'budget', 'cut', 'issues', 'raised', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'resulting', 'cut', 'art', 'music', 'programs', 'state', 'actually', 'occurred', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'student', 'been', 'mentioned', 'perhaps', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bright', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'However', 'successfully', 'portrayed', 'real', 'problem', 'modern', 'American', 'school', 'system', 'doubt', 'message', 'trying', 'send', 'Subtlety', ""n't"", 'part', 'film', 'charm.I', 'actually', 'felt', 'most', 'scenes', 'have', 'relevance', 'scene', 'funeral', 'boy', 'killed', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'stock', 'moment', 'least', 'was', 'mercifully', 'brief', 'tasteful', 'rather', 'pouring', 'hokey', 'dialogue', 'allowed', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'make', 'tired', 'point', 'stoner', 'class', 'prove', 'excellent', 'influential', 'teaching', 'methods', 'end', 'film.The', 'encounter', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'had', 'young', 'singer', 'school', 'play', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'did', 'actually', 'add', 'story', 'point', 'could', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'always', 'had', 'gave', 'up', 'when', 'had', 'child', 'bought', 'house', 'etc', 'expression', 'Dreyfuss', 'face', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'impact-', 'perhaps', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'noticed', 'then', 'had', 'been', 'simply', 'marking', 'time', 'life', 'expecting', 'be', 'different', 'quot', 'day', 'quot', 'very', 'song', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'son', 'line', 'quot', 'life', 'what', ""'re"", 'busy', 'making', 'other', 'plans', 'quot', 'scene', 'singer', 'when', 'short', 'character', 'catharsis', 'scene-', 'when', 'actually', 'pleased', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'really', 'nothing', 'original', 'be', 'found', 'script', 'characters', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'quot', 'simply', 'fairly', 'well-done', 'telling', 'common', 'tale', 'What', 'tolerable', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'mostly', 'steer', 'clear', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'dialogue', 'even', 'more', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'scenes']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

They convince him that his students and the success stories of his teaching ARE his symphony. In tribute to him they play his work. An interesting part of the story is that his son is born deaf, which is the greatest sadness and irony for Mr. Holland because of his own intense love for music. He had expected to share it with his son. He has incredibly difficult relations with his son for years because he refuses to learn sign language to communicate with his son and feels that his son cannot relate to him at all.

A young wife and the responsibility of a baby about to arrive make him seek a job as a music teacher. Soon, he is no longer paying the rent of an apartment, but considering a house because they no longer fit within such confined space.His dream to compose one piece that would achieves his dream to leave a legacy to make a difference in the music world is set aside as he takes on the role of mentor, husband, friend, father, teacher, counselor and the more involved he becomes in the dreams of his students, the further his dream appears to be.Richard Dreyfuss acts with amazing honesty, revealing feelings of love, inspiration, frustration, anger, anxiety with such finesse that we care and suffer right along side the Holland family.There are many quotes that stayed with us as we watched this fantastic film, lines said with such profound wisdom that I noted them down to ponder on the lessons learned. One of my favorite statements is what we learn as we navigate our own lives, and that is:* Life is what happens to us when we are busy making other plans.The movie takes us through his entire life, from 1965 to the 90s and it is remarkable how it weaves viewers through the fabric of the turmoil of the 60's, the challenges of the 70s and 80s and finally to the time he is forced to leave the teaching profession because the music program at his school is canceled due to budgetary pressures.And here is where the movie made us cry. On his way out, he feels the nagging pressure of having given up his dreams for nothing, because now, he does not even have his job. As he clears his office, taking his things in boxes with the help of his wife and son, Mr. Holland hears sounds in the auditorium and goes to investigate what that is all about, only to find all his students... all graduating classes have gathered to thank a man that gave them the gift of music.A student whom he tutored during his first year as a teacher is now Governor and she delivers the most beautiful lines during this movie, for she tells Mr. Holland that ""he has profoundly influenced my life and the lives of all gathered in this auditorium. I have the feeling that Mr. Holland considers a large part of his own life misspent because he never accomplished the symphony he was composing to make him famous, rich, or probably both.""And as she looks around the room, filled with students, parents, friends, she says: ""Mr. Holland, you are not rich or famous, at least not beyond the walls of this hall, so you may think you are a failure, but you would be wrong, because you have achieved a success beyond riches and fame, for as you look around you, you have touched the lives of all gathered here. We are your symphony Mr. Holland, we are the melodies and the notes of your opus... we are the music of your life!""If you want to see a movie that touches your heart, if you have teenagers that are in need of inspiration, and if you wonder about dreams you have set aside to accomplish much for others, watch this film and the true purpose of life will reveal that fame and fortune are not necessarily the true goals in life.

399410,A1D4D1C6GQKVJU,6304078102,FloydWaters,"[4, 4]","I'd like to begin by saying that my rating for Mr. Holland's Opus is a 4.5.  With my love for this movie, I chose to round to five.  I think the reader deserves an explanation as to how I arrived at this number, because it's a bit unusual.  I recognize that some of the other reviewers have valid criticisms about things that were in the plot that perhaps didn't work as well as they could have, and if I graded this on that aspect alone, I'd award a 3.5.  What I gave back a full star for was the score done by Michael Kamen.  *Especially* in a film that is about music, this is integral to the experience, and I think Mr. Kamen isn't getting nearly enough credit here.  In fact, I would *very* much like to see a re-release of the DVD that, in the &quot;Production Notes&quot;, will include a vastly expanded section about Michael Kamen and the process of composing the score for this movie.  Any footage they have would be much appreciated--as it is, I cannot believe just how little attention was given to him and his work.As to the plot...I have to say, I say unashamedly that I was and still am moved by it.  I'm not going to rehash exactly what happens because many people have already done that job for me; my focus in writing this is elsewhere.  I should like to make the point that in addition to the human element of the plot, it does point out a very important problem--the diminishing of music and art programs in our schools.  In fact, Richard Dreyfuss and Michael Kamen set up the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation in an effort to help in this matter, something which I hope readers will take a look at.  I can say from my own experience that had I not had the great musical education in school that I was lucky enough to have, I would've missed out on a lot.I only saw the movie a few times in the years since it was released, and as well as many details of the plot, the *impressions* of the music, even if not the note-for-note particulars, burned themseves indelibly upon my brain. Among my favorites are the powerful &quot;Iris&quot; theme, and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Rowena&quot;. The latter is a tune that, upon seeing the movie a few weeks ago for the first time in years, became instantly familiar the second I heard it again--I felt as if I'd found a tune I'd been seeking for all the intervening time in my own musical meanderings. That, more than anything, ought to serve as a testament to what Michael wrote here.The &quot;Finale&quot; now has a strange parallel meaning to what it held in the movie. The music program having been cut off suddenly, the students Glenn Holland has had over the years gather to give him a glorious send-off, and to prove to him that his career, even abruptly abbreviated as it was, had a tremendous influence. That influence is the legacy of him that they will carry in their hearts. So it is now with the man who was truly behind that music--Michael Kamen passed away very suddenly on the 18th of November, 2003.  But there is no doubt that through this, and many other things, he *will* have a fantastic legacy.  I truly hope you will open your hearts to the music and the memory...to know its power and joy.--Written in memory of Maestro Michael Kamen",5,Proud to be sentimental over this treasured memory,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,3217,"[""'d"", 'like', 'begin', 'saying', 'rating', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', '4.5', 'love', 'movie', 'chose', 'round', 'five', 'think', 'reader', 'explanation', 'how', 'arrived', 'number', 'bit', 'unusual', 'recognize', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'valid', 'criticisms', 'things', 'were', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'graded', 'aspect', 'alone', ""'d"", 'award', '3.5', 'What', 'gave', 'back', 'full', 'star', 'was', 'score', 'done', 'Michael', 'Kamen', '*Especially*', 'film', 'music', 'integral', 'experience', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Kamen', ""n't"", 'getting', 'nearly', 'enough', 'credit', 'here', 'fact', 'would', '*very*', 'much', 'see', 're-release', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Production', 'Notes', 'quot', 'will', 'include', 'vastly', 'expanded', 'section', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'process', 'composing', 'score', 'movie', 'footage', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'work.As', 'plot', 'have', 'say', 'say', 'unashamedly', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'moved', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rehash', 'exactly', 'what', 'because', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'job', 'focus', 'writing', 'elsewhere', 'should', 'like', 'make', 'point', 'addition', 'human', 'element', 'plot', 'point', 'out', 'very', 'important', 'problem', 'diminishing', 'music', 'art', 'programs', 'schools', 'fact', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'set', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'Foundation', 'effort', 'help', 'matter', 'something', 'hope', 'readers', 'will', 'take', 'look', 'can', 'say', 'own', 'experience', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'great', 'musical', 'education', 'school', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'would', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'out', 'lot.I', 'only', 'saw', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'details', 'plot', '*impressions*', 'music', 'even', 'not', 'note-for-note', 'particulars', 'burned', 'themseves', 'indelibly', 'brain', 'favorites', 'are', 'powerful', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'theme', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'Rowena', 'quot', 'latter', 'tune', 'seeing', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'became', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'second', 'heard', 'again', 'felt', ""'d"", 'found', 'tune', ""'d"", 'been', 'seeking', 'intervening', 'time', 'own', 'musical', 'meanderings', 'more', 'anything', 'ought', 'serve', 'testament', 'what', 'Michael', 'wrote', 'here.The', 'quot', 'Finale', 'quot', 'now', 'strange', 'parallel', 'meaning', 'what', 'held', 'movie', 'music', 'program', 'having', 'been', 'cut', 'off', 'suddenly', 'students', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'had', 'years', 'gather', 'give', 'glorious', 'send-off', 'prove', 'career', 'even', 'abruptly', 'abbreviated', 'was', 'had', 'tremendous', 'influence', 'influence', 'legacy', 'will', 'carry', 'hearts', 'now', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'music', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'passed', 'away', 'very', 'suddenly', '18th', 'November', '2003', 'doubt', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'fantastic', 'legacy', 'truly', 'hope', 'will', 'open', 'hearts', 'music', 'memory', 'know', 'power', 'joy.', 'Written', 'memory', 'Maestro', 'Michael', 'Kamen']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

In fact, this movie delivers both definition and demonstration of music appreciation  as a whole, absent of selective bias.  Devoid of senseless killings,  violence, or notable language, Opus is a family movie without the corny  overtones.  For many it's a tearjerker.But Mr. Holland's Opus unfolds an  issue.  It is a simple plea for an increase in music appreciation among  society--particularly our young people.  Mr. Holland's career is pressured  more and more by the gradual, yet perpetual governmental cuts in school  funding for the arts amid the US.  In sharp contrast, the movie makes it  clear that support for the sports programs in public schools remain firm  and solid.  Careful to avoid cursing this predicament or hurling insults  toward society, this message is rather Hollywood's way of calmly saying,  &quot;Take a look,&quot; using the common life of an otherwise forgotten  music teacher.The central beauty of the movie is in the character of  Mr. Holland himself.  He is an ardent yet sensible lover of music.  The  viewer will find no arrogance or snootiness in Mr. Holland.  It's not his  style.  Instead, Holland's concern for the progressive loss of interest in  the arts is voiced simply, directly, and peacefully.The movie delivers  a powerful message through ordeals within his family.  Struggling with the  hardships of common fate (and some not so common), Holland learns new  depths of love and companionship from both his wife and son.  He is a man  of emotions like anyone else.  He looses his temper on occasions.  But Mr.  Holland is always in control of himself.  He deals with pressures to the  best of his ability as they occur.Mr. Holland is a believable person.  The viewer is free to place him into society with the rest of the world and  to walk in his shoes for a spell.

One more and nothing else. They would be slightly wrong. This film is a lot more interesting and profound than that. First of all it becomes personal and poignant when his own son is discovered to be 90% deaf at birth. For a musician and music teacher tbis is a tragic blow, even if Beethoven became deaf in his life. Then it shows that a good teacher is not supposed to caress the students in the smooth way of things, but he has to be both exacting and demanding on one side and on the other side helpful in the effort the students have to do to eventually come to the pleasure of becoming able to play beautiful music. And it takes a tremendous effort on the teacher's part to be that inspiring and ruthless guide who will teach rhythm and drumplaying to a black man who will die in Vietnam, sentiment and clarinet playing to the only daughter of a family who has no creative dimension, emotion and how to sing with her heart to a girl who would like to take her music teacher along with her to New York. But furthermore the film is also a vast trip from the sixties to the nineties, from Kennedy to - the unnamed - Clinton, with the Vietnam war at the back, Hair, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Nixon resigning, Ford falling when walking down from a plane, Reagan and his famous Hollywood smile, and of course the severe cuts in education in the mid-nineties that led to dropping all artistic activities from the curriculum of the school. And we could go on and on with levels of meaning that avoid mish-mash sentimentalism. And yet the end is kind of too much. How can we imagine the school, the principal and the whole community who have rejected the man at sixty without more ado than for an insignificant incident come together to unanimously present him with a farewell present that should have asked months of secret preparation ? And that present means that this Mr Holland has sacrificed all his personal and musical potential for the sake of teaching music to kids, including his composing and his musical inspiration. This leads to the saddest fact of all : education is based on a frustrating d&eacute;dication from the teachers. A dedication that verges onto sacrifice, of one's own life and of one's family's life, and a frustration that stifles in the teacher what is his deepest and most insanely creative inspiration, which delivers him to retirement a hollow shell with an uncatchable ghost of a dead ambition. This film is thus very painful : as long as our school system will demand such sacrifices from its teachers it will lead to a deeply boring and frustrating education that will leave young people naked and unarmed in front of life when the real hardships of history come, and they always come back over and over again.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne",5,How Can We Be Deaf To Music?,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2963,"['blas', 'eacute', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'life', 'retirement', 'good', 'teacher', 'One', 'more', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'slightly', 'wrong', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'profound', 'First', 'personal', 'poignant', 'when', 'own', 'son', 'discovered', 'be', '90', '%', 'deaf', 'birth', 'musician', 'music', 'teacher', 'tbis', 'tragic', 'blow', 'even', 'Beethoven', 'became', 'deaf', 'life', 'Then', 'good', 'teacher', 'not', 'supposed', 'caress', 'students', 'smooth', 'way', 'things', 'be', 'exacting', 'demanding', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'side', 'helpful', 'effort', 'students', 'have', 'do', 'eventually', 'come', 'pleasure', 'becoming', 'able', 'play', 'beautiful', 'music', 'tremendous', 'effort', 'teacher', 'part', 'be', 'inspiring', 'ruthless', 'guide', 'who', 'will', 'teach', 'rhythm', 'drumplaying', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'Vietnam', 'sentiment', 'clarinet', 'playing', 'only', 'daughter', 'family', 'who', 'creative', 'dimension', 'emotion', 'how', 'sing', 'heart', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'music', 'teacher', 'New', 'York', 'furthermore', 'film', 'also', 'vast', 'trip', 'sixties', 'nineties', 'Kennedy', 'unnamed', 'Clinton', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'back', 'Hair', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Nixon', 'resigning', 'Ford', 'falling', 'when', 'walking', 'down', 'plane', 'Reagan', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'smile', 'course', 'severe', 'cuts', 'education', 'mid-nineties', 'led', 'dropping', 'artistic', 'activities', 'curriculum', 'school', 'could', 'go', 'levels', 'meaning', 'mish-mash', 'sentimentalism', 'yet', 'end', 'kind', 'too', 'much', 'How', 'can', 'imagine', 'school', 'principal', 'whole', 'community', 'who', 'have', 'rejected', 'man', 'sixty', 'more', 'ado', 'insignificant', 'incident', 'come', 'together', 'unanimously', 'present', 'farewell', 'present', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'months', 'secret', 'preparation', 'present', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'sacrificed', 'personal', 'musical', 'potential', 'sake', 'teaching', 'music', 'kids', 'including', 'composing', 'musical', 'inspiration', 'saddest', 'fact', 'education', 'based', 'frustrating', 'd', 'eacute', 'dication', 'teachers', 'dedication', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'one', 'family', 'life', 'frustration', 'teacher', 'what', 'deepest', 'most', 'insanely', 'creative', 'inspiration', 'retirement', 'hollow', 'shell', 'uncatchable', 'ghost', 'dead', 'ambition', 'film', 'thus', 'very', 'painful', 'as', 'long', 'school', 'system', 'will', 'demand', 'such', 'sacrifices', 'teachers', 'will', 'lead', 'deeply', 'boring', 'frustrating', 'education', 'will', 'leave', 'young', 'people', 'naked', 'unarmed', 'front', 'life', 'when', 'real', 'hardships', 'history', 'come', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'again.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Panth', 'eacute', 'Sorbonne']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

Unfortunately, such dreams don't pay the rent and utilities, so Holland is forced to take a job as a music teacher in the local high school until his legacy is composed and put to music. However, as is so often the case because of unforeseen circumstances, the stopgap job becomes permanent. In Holland's case, the critical event is the unplanned pregnancy of his wife Iris, played by Glenne Headley, and the subsequent birth of a son. So, a year or two becomes three decades, and, in the end, Holland faces the realization that his legacy is of a different sort than originally envisioned.Filmed in and around Portland, Oregon, OPUS defines Holland through his relationships: his long-suffering wife, his paternally neglected son (ironically born with a significant impairment), the happy-go-lucky gym teacher (played wonderfully by Jay Thomas), the crusty school principal, the weasely vice-principal, and the phenomenally talented student (played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly) who, unlike Holland, has the determination to act on her own dream now.The movie's conclusion is pure schmaltz. However, it works, I think, because the audience has long since conceded Holland's contribution to the young lives he's touched, and because there's maybe a little of Holland in each of us. How many can truly say that they've realized the dreams of their youth, much less been of usefulness to the community, rather than living lives of quiet desperation.

399436,A240QB45BSMDAN,6304078102,Josh P.,"[1, 1]","""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest contemporary classics. This film shows how a teacher can have a tremendous impact on years' worth of students. Richard Dreyfuss is a struggling composer and musician who is ""dragged into"" teaching music at a high school. He's filled with hopes and dreams of his own, but the realities of life, large and small, affect him. Even though he has such a passion to strive for greatness of his own through composing and being a musician, his true passion comes out through his teaching. Again, truly how a teacher should be. Mr. Holland not only taught the values and essence in musical education, but the everyday, importnat values in life. He taught the values of determination and courage, like a shy and quiet girl trying her heart out to be great at playing the clarinet, or a distressed ex-football and ex-wrestler student how to play a bass drum. Simple little stuff; well, maybe not little, because as he syas ""It takes a lot of work to learn a musical instrument."" However, a little confidence and determination can go a long way. The different characters of certain students depicted in the film are just examples of how effective this teacher was. A great example is the senior girl who dreams of going to New York to become a famous singer. Mr. Holland realizes that there was truly someone who was passionate about something he could relate with. If it hadn't been for his confidence he instilled, she never would have gone on and pursued her dream. (It would have been nice to have known if she made it or not. Then again, I don't know if it's a true story, but we got to have a little imagination.) It's sad to know that because of some rotten budget, he was cut from his job along with the entire music and arts programs in the school near the end of the story. Still, even though we start to feel that it was all for what, his is a success story, as the generations and years of students who respond to his retirement, particularly the clarinet girl as she became the governor! It seems like all that drive and confidence to get to something like that all lead back to Mr. Holland. To me, there should be so many more teachers like that. Yes, ""life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,""; it's true. It was in the students that he inspired and lead to success.",5,Truly all about what a teacher should be.,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2354,"['Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'contemporary', 'classics', 'film', 'how', 'teacher', 'can', 'have', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'years', 'worth', 'students', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'struggling', 'composer', 'musician', 'who', 'dragged', 'teaching', 'music', 'high', 'school', 'filled', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'own', 'realities', 'life', 'large', 'small', 'affect', 'Even', 'passion', 'strive', 'greatness', 'own', 'composing', 'being', 'musician', 'true', 'passion', 'out', 'teaching', 'Again', 'truly', 'how', 'teacher', 'should', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'not', 'only', 'taught', 'values', 'essence', 'musical', 'education', 'everyday', 'importnat', 'values', 'life', 'taught', 'values', 'determination', 'courage', 'shy', 'quiet', 'girl', 'trying', 'heart', 'be', 'great', 'playing', 'clarinet', 'distressed', 'ex-football', 'ex-wrestler', 'student', 'how', 'play', 'bass', 'drum', 'Simple', 'little', 'stuff', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'little', 'lot', 'work', 'learn', 'musical', 'instrument', 'However', 'little', 'confidence', 'determination', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'different', 'characters', 'certain', 'students', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'examples', 'how', 'effective', 'teacher', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'senior', 'girl', 'who', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'become', 'famous', 'singer', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'was', 'truly', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'passionate', 'something', 'could', 'relate', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'confidence', 'instilled', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'pursued', 'dream', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'known', 'made', 'not', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'story', 'got', 'have', 'little', 'imagination', 'sad', 'know', 'rotten', 'budget', 'was', 'cut', 'job', 'entire', 'music', 'arts', 'programs', 'school', 'end', 'story', 'Still', 'even', 'start', 'feel', 'was', 'what', 'success', 'story', 'generations', 'years', 'students', 'who', 'respond', 'retirement', 'particularly', 'clarinet', 'girl', 'became', 'governor', 'drive', 'confidence', 'get', 'something', 'lead', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'teachers', 'Yes', 'life', 'what', ""'re"", 'busy', 'making', 'other', 'plans', 'true', 'was', 'students', 'inspired', 'lead', 'success']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

399438,A1XZA0HJ10Z0VL,6304078102,Kameelyun,"[5, 6]","...this movie has recently had a profound impact on me.  I saw it in the theatre in 1996, when I was a senior in high school.  While I enjoyed it then, it is more poignant, tear-jerking and soul-enobling 8 years later as a 25-year-old.  My compliments to Hollywood for putting out a major flick whose message is that only human folly is responsible for not funding quality education of the arts for our children.The only forgivable believability gap is that once Mr. Holland turns his teaching attitude around after his first five months, the orchestra gets TOO good, TOO quickly.  Up to January, the orchestra sounds as bad as humanly possible.  By the end of that same school year the orchestra sounds about as good as, say, the Cincinnati Youth Symphony, of which I was a member when I first saw this movie in 1996.  The Cincinnati Youth Symphony (or any Major American City, USA Youth Symphony) consists of the area's most advanced high-school-aged musicians.  These are the ones who are most likely the best player on their instrument at their local high school, regularly practice multiple hours a day and perhaps give up a certain degree of normal high-school life in order to excel on their instrument.  Regardless of how much of a ""genius"" Mr. Holland might have been at teaching, it is impossible to believe that ANY orchestra can get THAT good, THAT soon.  And in a later scene in the movie, right before Mr. Holland sings Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy,"" the school orchestra is shown playing the final coda of Beethoven's ""Eroica"" Symphony, and they sound as good as a major professional orchestra, and I myself have played that piece with PROFESSIONAL ensembles that don't sound as good as the students of JFK High!  :)  Nonetheless, this criticism does not get in the way of the main messages of the film and does not warrant the docking of any stars.At the end, when Mr. Holland tells principal Walters that ""Cut the arts and... pretty soon these kids won't have anything to read and write about,"" it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote:  ""If we're not fighting for the arts and culture, what are we fighting for?""",5,As a professional violinist...,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,2127,"['movie', 'recently', 'had', 'profound', 'impact', 'saw', 'theatre', '1996', 'when', 'was', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'more', 'poignant', 'tear-jerking', 'soul-enobling', '8', 'years', 'later', '25-year-old', 'compliments', 'Hollywood', 'putting', 'out', 'major', 'flick', 'message', 'only', 'human', 'folly', 'responsible', 'not', 'funding', 'quality', 'education', 'arts', 'children.The', 'only', 'forgivable', 'believability', 'gap', 'once', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'teaching', 'attitude', 'around', 'first', 'five', 'months', 'orchestra', 'TOO', 'good', 'TOO', 'quickly', 'January', 'orchestra', 'sounds', 'as', 'bad', 'humanly', 'possible', 'end', 'same', 'school', 'year', 'orchestra', 'sounds', 'as', 'good', 'say', 'Cincinnati', 'Youth', 'Symphony', 'was', 'member', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', '1996', 'Cincinnati', 'Youth', 'Symphony', 'Major', 'American', 'City', 'USA', 'Youth', 'Symphony', 'area', 'most', 'advanced', 'high-school-aged', 'musicians', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'best', 'player', 'instrument', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'regularly', 'practice', 'multiple', 'hours', 'day', 'perhaps', 'give', 'up', 'certain', 'degree', 'normal', 'high-school', 'life', 'order', 'excel', 'instrument', 'Regardless', 'how', 'much', 'genius', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'teaching', 'impossible', 'believe', 'ANY', 'orchestra', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'THAT', 'soon', 'later', 'scene', 'movie', 'right', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Lennon', 'Beautiful', 'Boy', 'school', 'orchestra', 'shown', 'playing', 'final', 'coda', 'Beethoven', 'Eroica', 'Symphony', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'major', 'professional', 'orchestra', 'have', 'played', 'piece', 'PROFESSIONAL', 'ensembles', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'students', 'JFK', 'High', 'Nonetheless', 'criticism', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'main', 'messages', 'film', 'not', 'warrant', 'docking', 'stars.At', 'end', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'principal', 'Walters', 'Cut', 'arts', 'pretty', 'soon', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'read', 'write', 'about', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'quote', ""'re"", 'not', 'fighting', 'arts', 'culture', 'what', 'are', 'fighting']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS
399439,A3BV9E9XSA4Z73,6304078102,Karl,"[4, 17]","Whoever wrote this script must surely have been trying to create an up-to-date, americanised version of the great British weepy ""Goodbye Mr Chips"".  Unfortunately the script and the score total undermine this excellent plan.Richard Dreyfuss does his best to make Glenn Holland, the initially reluctant but eventually dedicated teacher - and a very good best it is.  But in the end there are too many clich&eacute;s and not enough that is true-to-life.Above all else there is Mr Holland's ""Great American Symphony"".  This is a key element of the plot because:- His need to make money whilst he composes his masterpiece is the only reason he becomes a teacher.- His dream that the finished symphony will enable him to become a full-time composer is what keeps him going whenever things go wrong.- The final climax of the film centres around Mr Holland's pupils, past and present, getting together one last time to play this masterpiece on the day that Mr Holland is fired from his post.Yet the symphony itself, when we finally get to hear it, is actually brief, vacuous, laughable, and totally unmemorable.  If you've been paying attention to the plot you have to wonder how come Mr Holland himself is so unaware of his obvious lack of talent as a composer.The second major fault in the film also appears in the final scenes.Throughout the film Dreyfuss/Holland has regularly clashed with Vice Principal Wolters (more brilliant character acting, this time by William H. Macy), who regards the music department as a waste of time, space and money.In the end it is Wolters who informs Holland that, due to budget cuts, the music department is to be closed and that Holland's services are no longer required.  When Holland comments on how happy Wolters must be to see him go, Wolters replies:""I care about these kids just as much as you do.  And if I'm forced to choose between Mozart and reading and writing and long division, I choose long division.""Sounds level headed, huh?  But it ain't.  If the script writer had actually known anything about modern teaching then he would have known that there were already a number of reputable studies in existence which show that a regular helping of classical-type music (at least once a week) will actually RAISE all-round academic performance - including in reading, writing and long division.So what do we get?  An overly long film (just under 2.5 hours) with a fairly banal plot and an ending which features the triumph of mediocrity - both in teaching methods and in the symphony.I cannot help but imagine what it would have been like with a tighter script, a shorter running time, and an ending where the dawn of a new era of enlightened teaching was welcomed in by a genuinely creative piece of orchestral music.Bottom line:  this film is like a damp rocket, all fizz and no fire.  So sorry Mr Holland, if I want to watch a positive film about education I think I'll stick with Edward James Olmos in ""Stand and Deliver"".  Apart from anything else it is based on true events - not just a giant helping of schmaltzy fiction.",2,And the band (shouldn't have) played on,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,3068,"['Whoever', 'wrote', 'script', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'create', 'up-to-date', 'americanised', 'version', 'great', 'British', 'weepy', 'Goodbye', 'Mr', 'Chips', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'score', 'total', 'undermine', 'excellent', 'plan.Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'best', 'make', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'eventually', 'dedicated', 'very', 'good', 'best', 'end', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'not', 'enough', 'true-to-life.Above', 'else', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'Great', 'American', 'Symphony', 'key', 'element', 'plot', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'whilst', 'masterpiece', 'only', 'reason', 'teacher.-', 'dream', 'finished', 'symphony', 'will', 'enable', 'become', 'full-time', 'composer', 'what', 'going', 'whenever', 'things', 'go', 'wrong.-', 'final', 'climax', 'film', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'pupils', 'past', 'present', 'getting', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'play', 'masterpiece', 'day', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'fired', 'post.Yet', 'symphony', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'hear', 'actually', 'brief', 'vacuous', 'laughable', 'totally', 'unmemorable', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'plot', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'come', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'so', 'unaware', 'obvious', 'lack', 'talent', 'composer.The', 'second', 'major', 'fault', 'film', 'also', 'final', 'scenes.Throughout', 'film', 'Dreyfuss/Holland', 'regularly', 'clashed', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Wolters', 'more', 'brilliant', 'character', 'acting', 'time', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'music', 'department', 'waste', 'time', 'space', 'money.In', 'end', 'Wolters', 'who', 'informs', 'Holland', 'due', 'budget', 'cuts', 'music', 'department', 'be', 'closed', 'Holland', 'services', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'required', 'When', 'Holland', 'comments', 'how', 'happy', 'Wolters', 'must', 'be', 'see', 'go', 'Wolters', 'replies', 'care', 'kids', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'do', ""'m"", 'forced', 'choose', 'Mozart', 'reading', 'writing', 'long', 'division', 'choose', 'long', 'division', 'Sounds', 'level', 'headed', 'huh', 'ai', ""n't"", 'script', 'writer', 'had', 'actually', 'known', 'anything', 'modern', 'teaching', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'were', 'already', 'number', 'reputable', 'studies', 'existence', 'show', 'regular', 'helping', 'classical-type', 'music', 'least', 'once', 'week', 'will', 'actually', 'RAISE', 'all-round', 'academic', 'performance', 'including', 'reading', 'writing', 'long', 'division.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'overly', 'long', 'film', 'just', '2.5', 'hours', 'fairly', 'banal', 'plot', 'ending', 'triumph', 'mediocrity', 'teaching', 'methods', 'symphony.I', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tighter', 'script', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'ending', 'where', 'dawn', 'new', 'era', 'enlightened', 'teaching', 'was', 'welcomed', 'genuinely', 'creative', 'piece', 'orchestral', 'music.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'damp', 'rocket', 'fizz', 'fire', 'sorry', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'want', 'watch', 'positive', 'film', 'education', 'think', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Apart', 'anything', 'else', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'not', 'just', 'giant', 'helping', 'schmaltzy', 'fiction']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

The bottom line is love.Situated in Oregon in the fall of  1964, Glen Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) took up a job as a high school music  teacher as his wife became pregant.  Holland, now shouldered with added  responsibility as a soon-to-be father, a composer, and a teacher, faced the  immediate challenge of working with a diverse group of students:  the  naturally talented, the rebellious, and the physically impaired.This  is a movie about love and love of music.  Glenn Holland is the central  figure who strives to love his students and family through his devotion to  music.  Born deaf-toned, the dream of teaching his own son to become an  eminent violinist inevitably bursts with much frustration.  Glenn Holland  is not perfect; in fact, interactions with his students through failures  and triumphs gradually refine him to be a loving and well-respected man.  Love propels him to reconcile his frustration for his son and breaks the  ice in his relationship with his wife.For over 30 years, this young  composer has taught generations of students not only about music, but love,  respect, faith, and confidence.  The final reunion of his students features  orchestration of &quot;American Symphony&quot; to pay the highest tribute  to this self-sacrificing teacher.This is a movie that will move every  soul and make everyone's tears roll down the cheek.  It's all about love,  and love moves.

It is a film I have seen four times prior to today. I have enjoyed it each time, but today I found myself very moved by it. Maybe it's late midlife, maybe it's being unemployed, maybe it's my general state of concern for our educational system, or maybe it's my need to focus on what really counts and how we really touch each other's lives.Today, what held my attention was the relationship between a father whose life is built upon music and a son who cannot hear a note. Each struggles to ""listen"" to the other but lack a common medium. And then music shows the way. A deaf Beethoven lies upon the floor listening to his piano by way of the vibrations that pass from piano through wood. Cole tunes an engine be touching his ear to a screwdriver resting on the motor. Glenn Holland learns to speak to his son through sign language and the linking of sound to light. The film is all about listening and hearing. A new teacher who teaches because he cannot make a living as a composer listens to a principal who challenges his lack of connection and he becomes a master teacher. A husband listens to a wife looking to make a life, to have a home, and to reach beyond the deafness of a child to enter that child's mind. A wife listens to her husbands desire for fresh love from a student infatuated with him and stands off to the side knowing that he would do the right thing. A football coach befriends a music teacher, becomes his ally and then teaches his band to march, and his football players to dance listening to a side of himself that was easily shut down. A teacher listens to a football coach who says that the failure of a student to learn is a greater challenge to the teacher not the end of the road for the student.In the closing scene Mr. Holland, ending his career because the music program that he created has been eliminated, figures his life has amounted to very little. And then he gets to conduct a piece of music he has been trying to complete for 40 years. That piece of music is not confined to the pages before him or to the instruments that sound the notes. The musical masterpiece, his opus, is the great work he has done with the people whose paths he crossed in his apparently not-so-great life.The film has moved into my top 20 for ""those that inspire.""",5,Just the Right Notes,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,2422,"['cold', 'rainy', 'today', 'Snow', 'coming', 'needed', 'something', 'warm', 'friendly', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'seemed', 'would', 'fill', 'bill', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'times', 'prior', 'today', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'today', 'found', 'very', 'moved', 'Maybe', 'late', 'midlife', 'maybe', 'being', 'unemployed', 'maybe', 'general', 'state', 'concern', 'educational', 'system', 'maybe', 'need', 'focus', 'really', 'how', 'really', 'touch', 'other', 'lives.Today', 'what', 'held', 'attention', 'was', 'relationship', 'father', 'life', 'built', 'music', 'son', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'note', 'listen', 'other', 'lack', 'common', 'medium', 'then', 'music', 'way', 'deaf', 'Beethoven', 'floor', 'listening', 'piano', 'way', 'vibrations', 'pass', 'piano', 'wood', 'Cole', 'engine', 'be', 'touching', 'ear', 'screwdriver', 'resting', 'motor', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'speak', 'son', 'sign', 'language', 'linking', 'sound', 'light', 'film', 'listening', 'hearing', 'new', 'teacher', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'living', 'composer', 'principal', 'who', 'lack', 'connection', 'master', 'teacher', 'husband', 'wife', 'looking', 'make', 'life', 'have', 'home', 'reach', 'deafness', 'child', 'enter', 'child', 'mind', 'wife', 'husbands', 'desire', 'fresh', 'love', 'student', 'infatuated', 'off', 'side', 'knowing', 'would', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'football', 'coach', 'music', 'teacher', 'ally', 'then', 'teaches', 'band', 'march', 'football', 'players', 'dance', 'listening', 'side', 'was', 'easily', 'shut', 'down', 'teacher', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'failure', 'student', 'learn', 'greater', 'challenge', 'teacher', 'not', 'end', 'road', 'student.In', 'closing', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'ending', 'career', 'music', 'program', 'created', 'been', 'eliminated', 'life', 'amounted', 'very', 'little', 'then', 'conduct', 'piece', 'music', 'been', 'trying', 'complete', '40', 'years', 'piece', 'music', 'not', 'confined', 'pages', 'instruments', 'sound', 'notes', 'musical', 'masterpiece', 'opus', 'great', 'work', 'done', 'people', 'paths', 'crossed', 'apparently', 'not-so-great', 'life.The', 'film', 'moved', 'top', '20', 'inspire']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

While it is doubtful (although not entirely implausible) that the people whose lives Mr. Holland touched would be able to pull off a concert honoring the man like they did at the end of the movie, WHY should that detract from your enjoyment of the film? As Woody Allen said in ANNIE HALL, you can't get things perfect in life, so you try to get them perfect in art. Who the hell wanted to see Glenn Holland walk out of the school the last time dejected and forgotten? This is a man who gave up his dream (at first out of necessity but eventually out of dedication) to teach high school kids the wonder of music, and at the end of the movie he should walk out of the place for the last time thinking he's a failure? That is nonsense.As for his less-than-perfect character, it made him human. His profound disappointment at his son's deafness (something perfectly understandable, as he's a musician and wants to share his love of music with his son) is something he eventually comes to terms with (although it takes a long time) - yes, it's selfish of him to feel that way, but again, he's human. The moment when he figures out a way to communicate with his son using music is wonderful. As for comments about the place of the arts in schools, when Mr. Holland tells the school board that they're creating a generation of children who will not be able to think or create, he's absolutely right. There is a bankruptcy of imagination in this country, and cutting the arts is a big part of that problem.I myself enjoyed this movie tremendously and share it with everyone I can.",4,A touching MOVIE,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,1698,"['Notice', 'capitalized', 'word', 'movie', 'title', 'review', 'reason', 'did', '*movie*', 'not', 'fact', 'doubtful', 'not', 'entirely', 'implausible', 'people', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'touched', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'concert', 'honoring', 'man', 'did', 'end', 'movie', 'WHY', 'should', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'said', 'ANNIE', 'HALL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'things', 'perfect', 'life', 'try', 'get', 'perfect', 'art', 'Who', 'hell', 'wanted', 'see', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'walk', 'school', 'last', 'time', 'dejected', 'forgotten', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'dream', 'first', 'necessity', 'eventually', 'dedication', 'teach', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'wonder', 'music', 'end', 'movie', 'should', 'walk', 'place', 'last', 'time', 'thinking', 'failure', 'nonsense.As', 'less-than-perfect', 'character', 'made', 'human', 'profound', 'disappointment', 'son', 'deafness', 'something', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'musician', 'share', 'love', 'music', 'son', 'something', 'eventually', 'terms', 'long', 'time', 'yes', 'selfish', 'feel', 'way', 'again', 'human', 'moment', 'when', 'out', 'way', 'communicate', 'son', 'using', 'music', 'wonderful', 'comments', 'place', 'arts', 'schools', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'school', 'board', ""'re"", 'creating', 'generation', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'think', 'create', 'absolutely', 'right', 'bankruptcy', 'imagination', 'country', 'cutting', 'arts', 'big', 'part', 'problem.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'share', 'everyone', 'can']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

I rooted for the shark, and was disappointed when the aliens came in peace, so you can see why I expected to hate Mr. Holland's Opus.And in fact, this film is a two and a half hour parade of stereotypes equaled only by the seven dwarves. It's the thinking man's Forrest Gump, and the crowning achievement of screenwriter and clich&eacute; master Patrick Duncan. I rarely remember who said something first, but I can guarantee you Patrick Duncan said it last. Look for the shy student who learns self-confidence, the devoted wife who stands by her man, the dumb-but-honest kid who dies for his country, the small town kid with big city talent who risks everything for a shot at Broadway, the dedicated educators, the bureaucrats who stand in their way... lay the beans on your card and you can hit bingo before the denouement.But wait.I saw this film for just one reason: to see how badly they handled the Deaf character. In Hollywood, Deaf characters slide along a sorry continuum between the shy and melancholic, and the isolated and hostile, all symbolic, none bearing any similarity to any actual Deaf person I've ever met. Hearing people have no idea what Deaf people are actually like. The community of Deaf people in America is tight, it's vibrant, it's joyful, and every child born Deaf in America has this tremendous society just waiting to embrace it. But this isn't common knowledge among hearing America, who can only imagine themselves, suddenly cut off auditorily from the world they know, and so they project this onto characters they don't know, and create a sad stereotype with no basis whatsoever in reality.Anyway, so I walked into Mr. Holland's Opus already composing in my head the nasty things I could say in a review, but lo, this film-- once I found a poison ivy ointment that actually worked, and the relief I felt when the itching immediately subsided, THAT is how I felt watching this film. The Deaf kid is funny, bright, fights with his parents, and likes cars and science. Among all the symboloids that cross this film, the Deaf kid is the only real, three dimensional person. That has a lot of bearing on the actual lives of actual Deaf people.Since I was working as a sign language interpreter at the time, people kept asking me &quot;Have you seen Mr. Holland's Opus?&quot; and I'd say &quot;Yes,&quot; and then they'd say &quot;How realistic is it that this kid has a musician father? How many Deaf people have parents like Mr. Holland?&quot;And I'd answer &quot;All of them.&quot;Seriously. Take a guy who listens to news in his car, who doesn't own a CD player, tell him his child is Deaf, and suddenly he's weeping that junior will never hear the melodious strains of &quot;Mozart.&quot; He pronounces it to rhyme with &quot;Beaux arts.&quot;So Glen Holland is the symbolic, universal parent-of-Deaf-child. This time around hearing people are the symbols, and the Deaf kid is the one who is real.It's about time.",3,The Thinking Man's Forrest Gump,1005782400,"11 15, 2001",2001,2978,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'fan', 'rooted', 'shark', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'aliens', 'came', 'peace', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'expected', 'hate', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus.And', 'fact', 'film', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'parade', 'stereotypes', 'equaled', 'only', 'seven', 'dwarves', 'thinking', 'man', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'screenwriter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'master', 'Patrick', 'Duncan', 'rarely', 'remember', 'who', 'said', 'something', 'first', 'can', 'guarantee', 'Patrick', 'Duncan', 'said', 'last', 'Look', 'shy', 'student', 'who', 'self-confidence', 'devoted', 'wife', 'who', 'man', 'dumb-but-honest', 'kid', 'who', 'country', 'small', 'town', 'kid', 'big', 'city', 'talent', 'who', 'everything', 'shot', 'Broadway', 'dedicated', 'educators', 'bureaucrats', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'lay', 'beans', 'card', 'can', 'hit', 'bingo', 'denouement.But', 'wait.I', 'saw', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'how', 'badly', 'handled', 'Deaf', 'character', 'Hollywood', 'Deaf', 'characters', 'slide', 'sorry', 'continuum', 'shy', 'melancholic', 'isolated', 'hostile', 'symbolic', 'none', 'bearing', 'similarity', 'actual', 'Deaf', 'person', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'met', 'Hearing', 'people', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Deaf', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'community', 'Deaf', 'people', 'America', 'tight', 'vibrant', 'joyful', 'child', 'born', 'Deaf', 'America', 'tremendous', 'society', 'just', 'waiting', 'embrace', ""n't"", 'common', 'knowledge', 'hearing', 'America', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'off', 'auditorily', 'world', 'know', 'so', 'project', 'onto', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'create', 'sad', 'stereotype', 'basis', 'whatsoever', 'reality.Anyway', 'walked', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'already', 'composing', 'head', 'nasty', 'things', 'could', 'say', 'review', 'lo', 'film', 'once', 'found', 'poison', 'ivy', 'ointment', 'actually', 'worked', 'relief', 'felt', 'when', 'itching', 'immediately', 'subsided', 'how', 'felt', 'watching', 'film', 'Deaf', 'kid', 'funny', 'bright', 'fights', 'parents', 'cars', 'science', 'symboloids', 'cross', 'film', 'Deaf', 'kid', 'only', 'real', 'three', 'dimensional', 'person', 'lot', 'bearing', 'actual', 'lives', 'actual', 'Deaf', 'people.Since', 'was', 'working', 'sign', 'language', 'interpreter', 'time', 'people', 'kept', 'asking', 'quot', 'Have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'quot', ""'d"", 'say', 'quot', 'Yes', 'quot', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'quot', 'How', 'realistic', 'kid', 'musician', 'father', 'How', 'many', 'Deaf', 'people', 'have', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'quot', ""'d"", 'answer', 'quot', 'them.', 'quot', 'Seriously', 'Take', 'guy', 'who', 'news', 'car', 'who', ""n't"", 'own', 'CD', 'player', 'tell', 'child', 'Deaf', 'suddenly', 'weeping', 'junior', 'will', 'never', 'hear', 'melodious', 'strains', 'quot', 'Mozart.', 'quot', 'rhyme', 'quot', 'Beaux', 'arts.', 'quot', 'So', 'Glen', 'Holland', 'symbolic', 'universal', 'parent-of-Deaf-child', 'time', 'hearing', 'people', 'are', 'symbols', 'Deaf', 'kid', 'one', 'who', 'real.It', 'time']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

Set in the turbulence of the 1960's it sweeps you through 30 years of this man's life (the real-life events that are woven through it are well done). It is the story of a man with good intentions, a teacher who is still learning himself. Glenn Holland (played by Richard Dreyfuss) is an aspiring composer who turns to teaching music at a local high school as a way to help make ends meet and still have time for his composing. His dream in life is to compose an opus that would one day make him famous. His wife (played by Glenne Headley) is loving, devoted and supportive wife. Things begin to change when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child. Initially, Glenn has a great difficulty dealing with the fact that his son is deaf and gradually we see him pulling away from his family. For him, it is incomprehensible to have a child who is unable share his love of music. As we all do, Glenn has his faults, but he has a very big heart which keeps you tuned in to caring about him.This movie is about real people in realistic situations. We see a struggling teacher, the wife who supports the struggling teacher through everything, a caring well intentioned principal, a very strict, rigid vice principal, and the students who can all be found in any high school anywhere in the U.S.. The one thing that makes this movie magical is the simplicity of it.He's not a bad man, on the contrary, he's just a man. This is an inspirational movie that will stay with you long after you see it for the first time. It is the story of how you can discover new dreams as you pursue the old ones. Tried, true and timeless it is probably Richard Dreyfuss' greatest role yet. There are nothing but remarkable performances by this cast which includes Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt just to name a few.One thing that cannot be omitted from a review of this spectacularly moving film is the fantastic soundtrack. This PG movie should be required viewing for all music students (who knows, they might learn alot from it).",5,A Teacher Is Born,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,2141,"['totally', 'believable', 'student/teacher', 'drama', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'attention', 'beginning', 'Set', 'turbulence', '1960', '30', 'years', 'man', 'life', 'real-life', 'events', 'are', 'woven', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'man', 'good', 'intentions', 'teacher', 'who', 'still', 'learning', 'Glenn', 'Holland', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'aspiring', 'composer', 'who', 'teaching', 'music', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'help', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'composing', 'dream', 'life', 'compose', 'opus', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'make', 'famous', 'wife', 'played', 'Glenne', 'Headley', 'loving', 'devoted', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Things', 'begin', 'change', 'when', 'pregnant', 'birth', 'deaf', 'child', 'Initially', 'Glenn', 'great', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'fact', 'son', 'deaf', 'gradually', 'see', 'pulling', 'away', 'family', 'incomprehensible', 'have', 'child', 'who', 'unable', 'share', 'love', 'music', 'do', 'Glenn', 'faults', 'very', 'big', 'heart', 'tuned', 'caring', 'him.This', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'realistic', 'situations', 'see', 'struggling', 'teacher', 'wife', 'who', 'struggling', 'everything', 'caring', 'well', 'intentioned', 'principal', 'very', 'strict', 'rigid', 'vice', 'principal', 'students', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'high', 'school', 'anywhere', 'U.S..', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'magical', 'simplicity', 'it.He', 'not', 'bad', 'man', 'contrary', 'just', 'man', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'story', 'how', 'can', 'discover', 'new', 'dreams', 'pursue', 'old', 'ones', 'Tried', 'true', 'timeless', 'probably', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'greatest', 'role', 'yet', 'are', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'cast', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Jay', 'Thomas', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'just', 'name', 'few.One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'omitted', 'review', 'spectacularly', 'moving', 'film', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'PG', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'music', 'students', 'who', 'might', 'learn', 'alot']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS

This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.I am not sure I'd attend classes that begin with rhetoric like 'What is music?' but Dreyfuss does a decent job of a quasi-inspiring teacher. Although this band master could be a little less mean when returning assignments.The acting overall in the film is pretty plain though, and the somewhat interesting premise gets old real quick.Some scenes are even borderline idiotic. First, our supposedly great teacher expects kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be playing Mozart after one day.Then, there is a scene where he is teaching a girl how to play her clarinet. She has been playing the thing for 3 years but still can't get out a note. He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.Corny. Very corny.

The acting is first-rate, the score is wonderful, the script, although over-the-top at times, tells a beautiful story, and the ending leaves you in tears.  As a teacher myself, I could relate all too well at times with the struggles of Dreyfuss's character as he has difficulty balancing his family obligations and his career and he has the uncomfortable task of having to constantly fend off of a jealous assistant principal who resents Holland's popularity and would love to see him go inspite of the good work he is doing.  This is all par for the course these days for teachers.  We are nothing more than targets by some politicians, school boards, administrators, and parents.  Is it any wonder that 50% of all new teachers in this country calls it quits within the first 5 years of teaching.  We don't go into this profession for recognition or money as there is little of both, but a sincere pat on the back by an administrator or a short thank you note from a student or parent can go a long way sometimes; however, more often than not, we're blamed for so much that is beyond our control or abilities.So many of us do a thankless job everyday without complaint because we love what we do and hope our influence makes a difference in a kid's life as, perhaps, a teacher had made a difference in ours.  I became a teacher because of one great teacher I had in middle school, and I still feel his influence in my life today.  Mr. Holland struggles throughout the film with a feeling that he hasn't done enough with his career as a teacher after 30 years.  He questions what difference or influence he's made after a lifetime of teaching.  May we all be so dedicated.  This film inspires/encourages teachers to understand that we never see the results of our hard work, but it's out there, and reminds others of the nobility of the profession and the respect its entitled to have from all of us.",5,Truly Inspirational,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1945,"['one', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'films', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'score', 'wonderful', 'script', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'beautiful', 'story', 'ending', 'leaves', 'tears', 'teacher', 'could', 'relate', 'too', 'well', 'times', 'struggles', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'difficulty', 'balancing', 'family', 'obligations', 'career', 'uncomfortable', 'task', 'having', 'constantly', 'fend', 'off', 'jealous', 'assistant', 'principal', 'who', 'Holland', 'popularity', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'go', 'inspite', 'good', 'work', 'doing', 'par', 'course', 'days', 'teachers', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'targets', 'politicians', 'school', 'boards', 'administrators', 'parents', 'wonder', '50', '%', 'new', 'teachers', 'country', 'first', '5', 'years', 'teaching', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'profession', 'recognition', 'money', 'little', 'sincere', 'pat', 'back', 'administrator', 'short', 'thank', 'note', 'student', 'parent', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'sometimes', 'however', 'more', 'often', 'not', ""'re"", 'blamed', 'so', 'much', 'control', 'abilities.So', 'many', 'do', 'thankless', 'job', 'everyday', 'complaint', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'hope', 'influence', 'difference', 'kid', 'life', 'perhaps', 'teacher', 'had', 'made', 'difference', 'ours', 'became', 'teacher', 'one', 'great', 'teacher', 'had', 'middle', 'school', 'still', 'feel', 'influence', 'life', 'today', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'film', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'done', 'enough', 'career', 'teacher', '30', 'years', 'questions', 'what', 'difference', 'influence', 'made', 'lifetime', 'teaching', 'May', 'be', 'so', 'dedicated', 'film', 'teachers', 'understand', 'never', 'see', 'results', 'hard', 'work', 'out', 'there', 'others', 'nobility', 'profession', 'respect', 'entitled', 'have']",Mr. Holland's Opus VHS
