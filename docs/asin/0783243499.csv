71745,A3QR5L4SG42380,0783243499,Aaron Dwight King,"[3, 3]","First of all, the book is brilliant.  It is stomach-churning, it is haunting and it gets under your skin for a long time after.Several have said the book is Misogynist - this is an ignorant simplification.  If anything, the book plays against a misogynist attitude.  It tells the story in first person of a person who sees women as sex objects, and wants what he can get out of them.  This has been focussed on heavily by those who did not understand the book as it was a way of criticising something they didn't get without being accused of being censorial.Let it be clear: the character is misogynist because he grew out of a misogynist world: the '70s and '80s world of power and money.  This book critiques that world and the human products it produced.  It is not promoting misogyny any more than it is promoting killing dogs and blinding homeless people.  This man is reprehensible, and turns the camera on the reader/viewer to question why you feel enough sympathy to want Patrick Bateman to get away with murder (and torture, rape and animal cruelty).So, with that cleared up, on to the movie.  I have mixed feelings about the conversion from book to film.  Christian Bale fleshes out the character brilliantly, and is by far the greatest asset of the film.  The screenplay decided to head off in a different direction to the book towards the end and question reality and fantasy.  It is only by accepting this end goal that one can excuse the scene where a chainsaw dropped down several flights of stairs manages to hit a girl with the business end still running and kill her.Willem Dafoe is a solid actor who struggles with a role that doesn't really suit him, but does the best he can.The biggest problem with the film is in the end inevitable:  That it lacks the violent punch of the book.  Hollywood is far too weak-willed and fawning to ever allow a movie to be made of American Psycho that addresses the violence and its implications as portrayed in the book.  Perhaps somewhere in Eastern Europe the movie could be made without being Disney-fied, but never in America, and certainly not now in the era of Bush Jr.  Ironically, I don't think even THIS movie could be made in the current political climate.So is it horrible and gruesome?  No.  Does it raise questions about money, power and abuse? Yes.  Does it degrade women?  No.  Does it show women being degraded in an environment where money and power are abused?  Absolutely.  That's one of the ideas positted in the book which made it to the film.  So should you see the movie?  Yes.  Should you read the book?  If you have the stomach for it, it may well open your eyes.",4,"Great book, decent movie, NOT MISOGYNIST",1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,2642,"['First', 'all', 'book', 'brilliant', 'stomach-churning', 'haunting', 'skin', 'long', 'time', 'after.Several', 'have', 'said', 'book', 'Misogynist', 'ignorant', 'simplification', 'anything', 'book', 'misogynist', 'attitude', 'story', 'first', 'person', 'person', 'who', 'women', 'sex', 'objects', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'been', 'focussed', 'heavily', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'book', 'was', 'way', 'criticising', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'censorial.Let', 'be', 'clear', 'character', 'misogynist', 'grew', 'out', 'misogynist', 'world', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'world', 'power', 'money', 'book', 'world', 'human', 'products', 'produced', 'not', 'promoting', 'misogyny', 'more', 'promoting', 'killing', 'dogs', 'blinding', 'homeless', 'people', 'man', 'reprehensible', 'camera', 'reader/viewer', 'question', 'why', 'feel', 'enough', 'sympathy', 'want', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'torture', 'rape', 'animal', 'cruelty', '.So', 'cleared', 'up', 'movie', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'conversion', 'book', 'film', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'out', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'far', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film', 'screenplay', 'decided', 'head', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'book', 'end', 'question', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'only', 'accepting', 'end', 'goal', 'one', 'can', 'excuse', 'scene', 'where', 'chainsaw', 'dropped', 'down', 'several', 'flights', 'stairs', 'manages', 'hit', 'girl', 'business', 'end', 'still', 'running', 'kill', 'her.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'solid', 'actor', 'who', 'role', ""n't"", 'really', 'suit', 'best', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'end', 'inevitable', 'violent', 'punch', 'book', 'Hollywood', 'far', 'too', 'weak-willed', 'fawning', 'ever', 'allow', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'American', 'Psycho', 'violence', 'implications', 'portrayed', 'book', 'Perhaps', 'somewhere', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'being', 'Disney-fied', 'never', 'America', 'certainly', 'not', 'now', 'era', 'Bush', 'Jr.', 'Ironically', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'THIS', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'current', 'political', 'climate.So', 'horrible', 'gruesome', 'raise', 'questions', 'money', 'power', 'abuse', 'Yes', 'degrade', 'women', 'show', 'women', 'being', 'degraded', 'environment', 'where', 'money', 'power', 'are', 'abused', 'Absolutely', 'one', 'ideas', 'positted', 'book', 'made', 'film', 'So', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Should', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'stomach', 'may', 'well', 'open', 'eyes']",American Psycho VHS

71749,A2K7UODF2NWTM9,0783243499,"""acting4aliving""","[0, 0]","It would seem that very few people are getting adaptations from novels right these days (case in point:  read John Irving's &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, then watch what HE did with his own screenplay).  Brett Easton Ellis' novels explore a dark side of elite society...those people in the uppercrust who have everything, know everyone, and couldn't be more bored with their lives.  With his razor-sharp insight, you'd think Ellis speaks from firsthand experience and perhaps he does. Many people have faulted this movie, claiming it was insensitive, stupid, gross...and it is, in many ways.  But it's also clever, insightful, smart...and wickedly funny and true. That Christian Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, spends as much time dwelling on the suits he and his friends are wearing as he does on discussion of anything remotely &quot;important&quot; just drives home the idea of indifference.  Ellis' novels are full of these amazingly detailed accounts of clothing and fashion...this is what these people know!  Without bluntly saying so, it points out just how shallow society can be...and the film (and novel) point out just what one bored young man is capable of.

Success was decided based on a person's platinum credit card, his business card, the blondness (and dumness) of his girlfriend, but most of all - on his ability to get a 'res'at the best restaurants.There were very few special features on this DVD, mostly the standard (cast & crew, trailer, behind the scenes featurette, etc.).

However, like it's title character, Patrick Bateman, what you see on the outside is nothing like what is going on inside. Don't make the mistake of thinking this movie is just a cheap slasher flick (check out the sequel for that) or even a horror movie at all. Sure, it's horrifying at moments, and damn suspenseful in others, but what ""American Psycho"" boils down to is a satire of a superficial society, based primarily on which apartment you rent, what clothes you wear, who you're sleeping with, and what your business card looks like. A world that could only exist in New York City, in the 80's. Do the words ""Die Yuppie Scum"" mean anything to you?Christian Bale plays Bateman to perfection. I can't say I ever read the book, but Bale brings the character to life almost effortlessly. In fact, it's impossible at this point for me to see him in any movie without recalling his role here. He just never lets up. Patrick Bateman is cynical, malicious and downright hilarious, all in one. The supporting cast is rather impressive as well, with Willem Dafoe playing a detective suspicious of Bateman, Reese Witherspoon playing his plastic fiance and Jared Leto playing his unspoken rival. Made in 2000, but set in the 80's, the movie looks and feels like it's time. Watching the movie, you can almost feel the cold streets of New York as Patrick gives his own assistance to a helpless vagrant. ""American Psycho"" is possibly as cold-hearted and as mean a movie as you can find, but it is saved by its blacker-than-black sense of humor.

71755,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0783243499,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","Who is Patrick Bateman?A valid question for those reading this review.  One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill - kill - and kill again.  Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know.  Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman.  For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer.  Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within.  Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again.  His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw.  Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero.  Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard.  The biggest question is Paul Allen.  The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.  Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship - yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.  Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise.  Yet, something nags at our belief.  This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again.  Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.  Slasher film?  Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery.  There was a film entitled ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, ""American Psycho"" can do it like no other.For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s - than ""American Psycho"" is the film for you.  For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community.  Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding.  His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character - he was Patrick Bateman.  What is it with Bale - there hasn't been one underscored performance yet.  ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", ""Velvet Goldmine"", and the ""Machinist"" are all within my top films of all time.  ""American Psycho"" ranks above them all.  Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones.  The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis.  The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history.  The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes.  Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill  known as Christian Bale.I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.  As I watch this film for the dozenth time, I cannot find errors in the filmmaking.  Perhaps there errors with continuity, but I don't pay attention.  I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.  I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc.  I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story.  Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry - there is a newer version, the ""Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition"" that should remedy all of these missing elements.Overall, ""American Psycho"" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time.  While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant.  I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing.  The music is what stood out in my eyes.  There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston.  I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.  It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.  ""American Psycho"" is a look within the business soul.  As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the ""Wall Street"" arm, could  Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father?  The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity - all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.  For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America - this is the film for you.Now, I gotta go return some videos.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,You're so vain.

71767,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783243499,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","In all honesty, the first three quarters of `American Psycho' is flawless.  I have made my distain for this film obvious to many people but upon reflection even I must admit that the majority of its parts are pure brilliance.  And then the fourth quarter comes along and then entire film falls to pieces.  Honestly I don't think that Mary Harron understood Bret Easton Ellis' novel.  I am a huge fan of the book (I have it listed as one of the top five books everyone should own) and have learnt to embrace its controversial and disturbing overtones because underneath it all `American Psycho' (the novel) is a masterful depiction of humanity at its realist.  I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.When you read `American Psycho' it gets under your skin; first because of the gross and graphic depictions of murder and mayhem, but ultimately it crawls beneath you because you begin to rationalize with inhumanity.  You begin to realize that this man is trapped, as are you and I, in a world that places so much value on the clothes we wear and the toys we own that the value of another's life is tragically degraded.  What garners more attention; the murder of a homeless man or a blowout sale at JCPenney?  The answer is as obvious as it is heartbreaking.Mary Harron's adaptation loses that for me.  In the end Patrick Bateman is degraded to the depiction of a crazed lunatic as apposed to the ultimate portrayal of a society lost.  He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear-inspiring.  I vividly remember an image of a crouched over Christian Bale feasting on human flesh and I remember shaking my head in disgust for what Ellis' brilliant work of modern literature had been reduced to.This has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.  Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).  He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.  Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.  Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.  Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).You know, while I'm on that subject I might as well stay on that subject.  Jared Leto plays Paul Allen, one of Bateman's `victims'.  The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.  Why oh why could the climax of this film have been done in the same splendid manner?  I'm baffled because one scene is pure brilliance while the other is C-Grade cheesiness.I just want to throw my hands up in dire frustration.In the end I guess I'm forced to give this the thumbs down.  It could have been such a fantastic film; maybe even the best of the year.  The source material, while completely and understandably controversial and offensive, is one of the greatest and most influential novels to have ever been penned.  Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.  A lot of critics praised this movie; which goes to show that I will never understand this society's idea of a critic.

71768,A1FBZRYTAA6O1Z,0783243499,"Andrew Urquhart ""Metal Guru""","[2, 4]","Having been blown away by Brett Easton-Ellis' novel some ten years ago, I finally got around to watching this (at least partly inspired by the positive reviews here); I have got to say, I found it a pretty flat, disappointing adaptation.Fair play to Mary Harron for her noble efforts to bring this most unfilmable of novels to the silver screen. I have enjoyed her other stuff eg. 'I Shot Andy Warhol', which is definitely a much better film than this one.'American Psycho' ultimately lacks a certain spark, though it is hard to say why - possibly because of the fact that Harron has dispensed for the most part with the gore of the book. But there are more subtle things - for example, Bateman's constant internal dialogue is only really hinted at here, I felt - particularly his endless comments on his and others clothing.While the book features a vast smorgasbord of toe-curlingly violent scenes, the only point in the film which was remotely reminiscent of this unpleasantness was when Bateman holds a nail-gun to his secretary's head in his penthouse apartment.Of course, the violence in 'American Psycho' is metaphorical, used to underline Bateman's yuppie-scum inhumanity rather than define it outright. But by pussy-footing with it, the film becomes toothless - reminiscent of that other slightly painful adaptation of a classic Me-Generation novel 'Bonfire of the Vanities' (shiver).2 1/2 stars overall, because it remains broadly faithful to the book.

Evidence: The ""feed-stray-cat"" message on the ATM.  Also, the ending in which Bateman's lawyer says that he had just met the missing Paul Allen in London after the latter's supposed murder.2. There was a lofty conspiracy designed to protect Bateman.  This would then make the film very political with Bateman representing unregulated, ruthless corporations and his lack of accountability representing the machinations of society which cover up the destruction and enable it.  The evidence: the ending of the film in which Reagan delivers his Iran-Contra apologia speech points the film in a markedly political direction.  The depiction of yuppie rich materialistic life implicates a larger culture of unchecked consumption: corporations and their penchant for destruction.Either way, this film is a study of narcissism and moral vacuity (and perhaps something more), with Christian Bale giving a remarkable, hilarious performance.",5,A Great Satire: Beware of Spoilers,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1044,"['watching', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'several', 'interpretations', 'occurred', 'me.1', 'killings', 'are', 'fantasies', 'Evidence', 'feed-stray-cat', 'message', 'ATM', 'Also', 'ending', 'Bateman', 'lawyer', 'had', 'just', 'met', 'missing', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'London', 'latter', 'supposed', 'murder.2', 'was', 'lofty', 'conspiracy', 'designed', 'protect', 'Bateman', 'would', 'then', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'political', 'Bateman', 'representing', 'unregulated', 'ruthless', 'corporations', 'lack', 'accountability', 'representing', 'machinations', 'society', 'up', 'destruction', 'enable', 'evidence', 'ending', 'film', 'Reagan', 'Iran-Contra', 'apologia', 'speech', 'film', 'markedly', 'political', 'direction', 'depiction', 'yuppie', 'rich', 'materialistic', 'life', 'larger', 'culture', 'unchecked', 'consumption', 'corporations', 'penchant', 'way', 'film', 'study', 'narcissism', 'moral', 'vacuity', 'perhaps', 'something', 'more', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'giving', 'remarkable', 'hilarious', 'performance']",American Psycho VHS

71774,A16NUQ48R46KUY,0783243499,Anonymous,"[5, 6]","When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this, I was blown away.  Not just by the sex and the violence, but also by the great writing, acting, and overall atmosphere of the movie.  I thought it was astonishingly raw and very good.  My companion felt the complete opposite.  This is typical of the reviews of my friends: some loved it, some hated it.  No one was in between.What I'm trying to get across with my anecdote is that this movie, brilliant though it is, is just not for everyone.  The sex and the violence are so raw that I still find them disturbing.  However, they are nowhere near the book in terms of those (see my review of the book, coming shortly).  This movie manages to capture the important ideas and themes of the book, without the gratuitous violence.It's still a violent movie, though.  But it has so many redeeming qualities, so don't judge it on that alone.Some standout features:1. The exploration of identity.This comes through an amazingly tense scene in which Patrick Bateman, the lead, exchanges business cards with friends/rivals.  This was such a powerful scene that I find myself holding my breath whenever I watch it.  There's also a lot about mistaken identity.  I believe this is to show the utter lack of identity one had in the vile, excessive glamour of the rich in the 80s.  Everyone was interchangable.2. Not knowing whether the killings are real or a part of Bateman's sick fantasies.I'm inclined to go with the latter, but there are some great, skillfully ambiguous scenes that allow you to make an argument either way.3. The music/pop culture soliloqueysThese are in the book as well, and they're fantastic.  Bateman has some interesting music tastes.  He treats the lightest pop acts with the same weight as another would treat classical composers.  These pieces are hilarious.  Even if you hate the rest of the movie, you'll love these.This is just a great movie.  Definitely watch it, just not with a weak stomach.

71776,AI37X1O7K72FZ,0783243499,Anti-Hipster,"[2, 2]","American Psycho is a surprisingly funny movie. Patrick Bateman is supposed to embody all the worst qualities a man can have. But instead of coming across as the ultimate chauvinist pig, he comes across as a vain, bitchy homosexual. Fussing over one's appearance and popular music (as Bateman does) is a preoccupation of gay men. The book was written by a homosexual and directed by a woman (apparently a feminist), so perhaps this is why the insight here is a bit skewed. It is a homosexual's, or a feminist's, idea of a chauvinistic, egotistical male. It is an amusing caricature nonetheless.There are scenes that do capture the sort of male Bateman is supposed to represent. One of them had me in stitches. The scene features Bateman seated at a restaurant with some co-workers, where he delivers a sanctimonious speech about the need to end apartheid, provide for the homeless and fight for women's rights. Of course, Bateman believes none of this (prior to the scene, Bateman kicks a homeless man to death; and when he isn't objectifying women, he's concocting fantasies about murdering them). The speech is so phony that one of Bateman's co-workers cracks up. He can see right through it. That sort of empty moral posturing is typical of Bateman's type and it is quite artfully satirized in the scene.Bateman says that there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, but that as a person he simply doesn't exist. I take this to mean, not that Bateman is a psychopath, but that he's an instantiation of a Platonic ideal. He's an archetype of a narcissistic man. This is why his co-worker Paul Allen confuses Bateman with another co-worker, Marcus Halberstram. Even Bateman's own lawyer does this, calling him ""Davis."" Bateman is interchangeable with the other employees--he could be any one of them. The company is full of Patrick Bateman's, so he might as well be Marcus Halberstram or Davis.I'm not sure what the imaginary murders are supposed to mean. Bateman ostensibly murders his ex-girlfriend and a hooker, but when he returns to the scene of the crime there is no trace of the bodies. Bateman murders Paul Allen, but Bateman's lawyer claims that he ate lunch with Allen after the murder. However, the lawyer confuses Bateman with another man named Davis, so it's possible that he confused Allen with someone else. We never see Allen after the murder and a detective is hired to investigate his disappearance. And how did Bateman get into Allan's apartment to leave a message? I'm thinking Bateman did murder Allen, but maybe not the women. Some of this is obviously in Bateman's head (the ATM machine did not really tell him to stuff a kitten inside of it, and he didn't blow up those cop cars).Here I was expecting a gory thriller, but it turned out to be a satire, and an amusing one at that.",4,Portrait of a narcissist,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2797,"['American', 'Psycho', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'supposed', 'embody', 'worst', 'qualities', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'instead', 'coming', 'ultimate', 'chauvinist', 'pig', 'across', 'vain', 'bitchy', 'homosexual', 'Fussing', 'one', 'appearance', 'popular', 'music', 'Bateman', 'preoccupation', 'gay', 'men', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'homosexual', 'directed', 'woman', 'apparently', 'feminist', 'so', 'perhaps', 'why', 'insight', 'here', 'bit', 'skewed', 'homosexual', 'feminist', 'idea', 'chauvinistic', 'egotistical', 'male', 'amusing', 'caricature', 'are', 'scenes', 'do', 'capture', 'sort', 'male', 'Bateman', 'supposed', 'represent', 'One', 'had', 'stitches', 'scene', 'Bateman', 'seated', 'restaurant', 'co-workers', 'where', 'sanctimonious', 'speech', 'need', 'end', 'apartheid', 'provide', 'homeless', 'fight', 'women', 'rights', 'course', 'Bateman', 'none', 'prior', 'scene', 'Bateman', 'homeless', 'man', 'death', 'when', ""n't"", 'objectifying', 'women', 'concocting', 'fantasies', 'murdering', 'speech', 'so', 'phony', 'one', 'Bateman', 'co-workers', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'sort', 'empty', 'moral', 'posturing', 'typical', 'Bateman', 'type', 'quite', 'artfully', 'satirized', 'scene.Bateman', 'idea', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'person', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist', 'take', 'mean', 'not', 'Bateman', 'psychopath', 'instantiation', 'Platonic', 'ideal', 'archetype', 'narcissistic', 'man', 'why', 'co-worker', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'Bateman', 'co-worker', 'Marcus', 'Halberstram', 'Even', 'Bateman', 'own', 'lawyer', 'calling', 'Davis', 'Bateman', 'interchangeable', 'other', 'employees', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'company', 'full', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Marcus', 'Halberstram', 'Davis.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'imaginary', 'murders', 'are', 'supposed', 'mean', 'Bateman', 'ostensibly', 'ex-girlfriend', 'hooker', 'when', 'scene', 'crime', 'trace', 'bodies', 'Bateman', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'Bateman', 'lawyer', 'ate', 'lunch', 'Allen', 'murder', 'However', 'lawyer', 'Bateman', 'man', 'named', 'Davis', 'possible', 'confused', 'Allen', 'someone', 'else', 'never', 'see', 'Allen', 'murder', 'detective', 'hired', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'how', 'did', 'Bateman', 'get', 'Allan', 'apartment', 'leave', 'message', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Bateman', 'did', 'murder', 'Allen', 'maybe', 'not', 'women', 'obviously', 'Bateman', 'head', 'ATM', 'machine', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'tell', 'stuff', 'kitten', 'inside', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'up', 'cop', 'cars', '.Here', 'was', 'expecting', 'gory', 'thriller', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'satire', 'amusing', 'one']",American Psycho VHS

Even his &quot;American&quot; accent was flawless !He played a character that you really not only hated for his literal cutthroat antics but for his annoying behavior and obessession as a neat freak !Yet, there appeared to be times in the story where his &quot;sickness&quot; was also a cry for help...like a rabid or diseased dog waiting to be caught and put out of it's misery. Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.My understanding of the film was that it was a twisted/dark satirical comedy coinciding with a slasher/thriller movie (sort of like a recording artist ala Sarah Brightman singing opera while on the next track singing a pop ballad all on the same album); Different genres within the same context or realm. It was not just about a nutcase hacking people, but it was also a social commentary about commercialism, consumerism, and capitalism (the &quot;holy trintiy&quot; of Wall Street and upper class America)!This film falls under the category of &quot;eclectic and off-beat&quot;. While it sports all the glamor and typical nuance of a Hollywood big budget film it also serves well as an art house independent film for the Cannes Film Festival !",4,American Satire,971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,1585,"['American', 'Psycho', 'left', 'same', 'impression', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'did', 'unsatisfying', 'unfulfilled', 'ending', 'not', 'necessarily', 'expected', 'Bateman', 'get', 'upcommance.Maybe', 'just', 'missed', 'powerful', 'subtlety', 'climax', 'film', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'excellent', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'kind', 'personal', 'chuckle', 'imitating', 'uptight', 'arrogant', 'wall-street', 'American', 'yuppie', 'Even', 'quot', 'American', 'quot', 'accent', 'was', 'flawless', 'played', 'character', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'hated', 'literal', 'cutthroat', 'antics', 'annoying', 'behavior', 'obessession', 'neat', 'freak', 'Yet', 'appeared', 'be', 'times', 'story', 'where', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'cry', 'help', 'rabid', 'diseased', 'dog', 'waiting', 'be', 'caught', 'put', 'misery', 'Bale', '5', 'stars', 'stellar', 'performance.My', 'understanding', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'twisted/dark', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'coinciding', 'slasher/thriller', 'movie', 'sort', 'recording', 'artist', 'ala', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'singing', 'opera', 'next', 'track', 'singing', 'pop', 'ballad', 'same', 'album', 'Different', 'genres', 'same', 'context', 'realm', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'nutcase', 'hacking', 'people', 'was', 'also', 'social', 'commentary', 'commercialism', 'consumerism', 'capitalism', 'quot', 'trintiy', 'quot', 'Wall', 'Street', 'upper', 'class', 'America', 'film', 'category', 'quot', 'eclectic', 'off-beat', 'quot', 'sports', 'glamor', 'typical', 'nuance', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'also', 'well', 'art', 'house', 'independent', 'film', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival']",American Psycho VHS

Not really, but it has reached the point that I am unable to make heads or tails when making sense out of the story. The acting by the cast is ok, but it is the pacing of the film that dulled my senses. Watching the final thirty minutes is torturous for me to sit through as it transcended from ""weird"" to ""bizarre."" Is it a dream, or reality? Most of the events that have transpired during American Psycho are unrealistic and silly. Although Bret Easton Ellis did a good job in the novel Less Than Zero when painting the superficiality of the characters, this is also reflected in the movie American Psycho. Unfortunately, they all felt inhuman and plastic, thus leading me not to care about what happens during the film. It's disappointing to see that women are treated as mere objects. Moreover, there are too many young vice presidents in a room, leading me to think that the events that took place are all fake. Christian Bale's character is a good example of somebody with Asperger syndrome. All in all, I do think the whole film of American Psycho is done nicely, but everything else is too dull. In other words, American Psycho is a puppy while Psycho is the eternal master of its class. The rating of American Psycho stays the same as before.",1,Alfred Hitchock Already Did It with Psycho.

The movie itself is a four star masterpiece, and we get a bevy of special features and an extended cut.Mary Harron directs and co-writes with Guinevere Turner, who writes and appears as Elizabeth in the movie. They adapted the screenplay off of the book by Bret Easton Ellis. They use the backdrop of the Eighties and the Yuppster-wave to create a social satire, surreal black comedy, and suspense horror all rolled into one fantastic movie.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a yuppie who has all the right clothes, all the right friends (Bill Sage, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux), a gorgeus fiancee (Reese Witherspoon as Evelyn), he's cheating on her with her best friend (Sam Mathis as Courtney), and is rising to the height of wallstreet celebrity. There's just one problem.... He has a lust to kill. Everyone.The killer inside is someone he hides behind this mask of success and humanity. But he struggles to even be human. He longs for sex or violence, sometimes both. But when things start to get out of hand, he begins to lose his sanity, blending his perception of the monster within with the reality around him.Christian's performance is amazing, as we find out in the commentary that not only did he have an amazing and rigorous excercise regimen to get an amazing physique, but in some scenes when he is dealing with inspector Kimball (Dafoe) he actually sweats on cue. Anyone who has seen him in Batman Begins, The Machinist, Equilibrium, or Velvet Goldmine will know he is a modern master, always putting himself through intense preparations for his roles. The rest of the actors are great too, with their 80's parody and preppy accents. The only thing I thought needed more screen time was Willem Dafoe. He had plenty of time in the book, and he gets top billing, but he is hardly used in the movie.The movie does a really good job of an ambiguous ending and keeping the line between what Bateman is imagining, and whats actually happening. The scene where he is going on his rampage with the chainsaw, and the one with the gun, are so violent and over the top, that were not even sure why things are happening or if they even are. In the ending, were left with a sense that in a world where everyone strives to be the same, Bateman can't even be recognized as himself, even when he's trying to get caught. A scary and disturbed theme, that applies to more than the fictional world of Psycho, but seems as though it could have been a true story of the 80's and maybe even today.This is the 'uncut killer edition' so we're treated to some great specials features, in fact more (in a sense, more on that in a minute) than I've seen. The other editions had only a short making-of and a interview with Christian Bale. However, this edition gets 2 commentary tracks, Six deleted scenes, 3 making-of featurettes and behind-the-scenes/interviews. Also, and odd addition of an essay written by Holly Willis and read by singer Sarah Elquist.The first commentary features director/co-writer Mary Harron. She talks about the idea behind translating the book to screen, some of the happy accidents during shooting, the actors, etc. It's a good commentary that not only gives you info on the movie, and the controversary surrounding the book and movie. She follows the movie well and doesn't stop more than a couple times. The second track features Guinevere Turner, cowriter. She does not do such a good track speaking about her inspirations and what they changed and took out in reference to the book. But she really just watches the movie, and kinda complains.The 'Postcards from the 80's' featurettes are sort of a making-of crossed with the VH1 formula: A whole lot of critics and producers/crew and random celebrities talking about the three parts of getting the movie made; 'The Book', 'The Deal', 'The Film'. They also go quite in depth in these three bits about the controversy of the book, and later how that affected the movie. Also, there's another called, 'The 80's: Downtown'. It's a look at the nostalgia elements used in the film. Same idea as the others, random people including people involved in the movie.  Lastly, is 'The Violence of Pornography' essay. It looks at it's own social commentary from both sides. Something the films doesn't touch and not a lot of movies who would tell you the critique of it's content.Overall this disc is a great special release, and even if you already own the original, get this one.

71789,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,0783243499,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[7, 9]","""An American Psycho"" is one of those films that people seem to find very difficult to come to grips with. Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise? Is it a completely boring, insensitive piece of sick trash? Or is it something in between? Through all this argument though, there is one thing that cannot be denied. That this film will provoke a reaction from the viewer whether it is feelings of disgust, praise, amusement, unease or all of the above. Well, unless of course the viewer is in a similar state of mind as Patrick Bateman that is.You see, Patrick Bateman externally appears to be everything a man could want to be. He has a body to die for, a big earning job and all the worldly possessions that come with the territory. Yet despite all this, Patrick finds it difficult to feel anything. He states in the film that he feels no human emotions other than ""greed and disgust"" and it's this complete lack of connection with the world that drives him to violence. However, even these extreme outbursts of gruesome bloodshed still can't make him feel anything but empty and only distance him further from humanity, driving him towards madness.Christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning. He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity. Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him. An example of such bizarre behaviour is the way he verbally critiques Huey Lewis and the News while murdering a colleague. Or when he decides another colleague should die for the simple fact that they now have a better business card than he does. These occurrences are as funny as they are unsettling but never unintentionally so. The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow. I should point out though that I have not yet read the book and this review is based only on the movie itself and not the quality of the adaptation.""An American Psycho"" is not for the faint of heart and yet there essentially isn't all that much on-screen gore. Not to say that killing people with chainsaws and axes isn't gory, only that these brutal acts of slaughter are mostly either only suggested or just out of the cameras view. But more than the acts themselves, many viewers will find the nonchalant, motiveless way in which Patrick conducts them far more disturbing, not to mention his degrading use of women as self gratifying objects.I thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding. The only way in which I feel this film is not a complete success is in the ambiguousness of its final moments.

For the first part of the movie I could not help but laugh out loud. It is hilarious!But (not having read the book) guess who got sucked in and suckered out with the ending? This is class in a glass. The music, the clothes, the Master of the Universe yuppies all go to build a great background. Then there is Patrick Bateman (an outstanding performance by Christian Bale but more on that later)- a designer quoting, 1000 stomach crunches a day, body exfoliating and facial masking kind of corporate success you could see anywhere in the 80s.But of course Patrick is different. He kills: he kills with hammers, axes, staple guns (a real big one), chain saws. He decapitates, delimbs, hangs bodies up in his closet or just shoots them. This is all done in such a stylised way that it is funny - not horrific.But strongest of all is his narcissism. Because Patrick is just another screwed up yuppie who dreams all these murders, who cannot tell the difference between reality and a daydream but who is really no different to all his other peers.I loved this movie because it took me in one direction (the black comedy, the blood, the psychosis of a man losing control) but then it kicked me back to a very cerebral and deeply intuitive understanding of human nature and the rage within.Best of all was Christian Bale who I must admit I had not seen since Empire of the Sun.

You should meet Patrick BatemanThe 80s were  when the children of the 1960s counter-culture baby boomers rejected the values of their parents: chased a life of wealth and status. Coin sized roast pork with tropical lemon mint sauce, kiwi exfoliating body rub, $400 power ties and $15 dollar glasses of vodka were the goodies that the ""yuppies"" used to display and confirm their status.For Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), these toys were a front for much darker impulses. Bateman has the urge to kill: women, homeless people, rivals at work, anyone that happens to be in his way. Humanity is an annoyance to Patrick, a target for his ice cold, encompassing rage.His life and the crimes shown in American Psycho are filled with all the trappings and yuppie  rituals: the half hour skin lubricating showers, pricey dinners, and his relationship with the women he plans to marry but cares nothing about.  Buying the best tie, working towards a buff body, torturing a call girl: its all route and all the same to himAll this is treated with brilliant comic darkness: watch how, each time he commits a murder, he first makes a speech about the philosophical implications of vapid 1980s songs like Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love Of All"" or Huey Lewis's""Hip To Be Square."" The violence is ironic and funny:  we are  able to focus on the social satire, not lose the points in moral outrage.Bateman is empty and narsicistic to his very core, but so is the entire yuppie environment he has chosen. He is in ""murders and executions,"" he reveals when asked. He meant to say ""Mergers and Acquisitions. Lines like this are layered through American Psycho, as if one action is akin to the other.Bateman's cold killer persona is not unique in this shark pool: he is just the shark big enough to take these instincts to another level. Cutthroat business deals, murder: its all a zero sum game here with sociopath's rules.And you'll never have more fun than when you watch Bateman play that game in American Psycho",5,Classic,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2128,"['thought', 'Wall', 'Street', 'crowd', 'who', 'contributed', 'financial', 'crisis', '2008', 'was', 'bad', 'should', 'remember', '1980s', 'should', 'meet', 'Patrick', 'BatemanThe', '80s', 'were', 'when', 'children', '1960s', 'counter-culture', 'baby', 'boomers', 'rejected', 'values', 'parents', 'chased', 'life', 'wealth', 'status', 'Coin', 'sized', 'roast', 'pork', 'tropical', 'lemon', 'mint', 'sauce', 'kiwi', 'exfoliating', 'body', 'rub', '400', 'power', 'ties', '15', 'dollar', 'glasses', 'vodka', 'were', 'goodies', 'yuppies', 'used', 'display', 'confirm', 'status.For', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'toys', 'were', 'front', 'much', 'darker', 'impulses', 'Bateman', 'urge', 'kill', 'women', 'homeless', 'people', 'rivals', 'work', 'anyone', 'be', 'way', 'Humanity', 'annoyance', 'Patrick', 'target', 'ice', 'cold', 'encompassing', 'rage.His', 'life', 'crimes', 'shown', 'American', 'Psycho', 'are', 'filled', 'trappings', 'yuppie', 'rituals', 'half', 'hour', 'skin', 'lubricating', 'showers', 'pricey', 'dinners', 'relationship', 'women', 'marry', 'nothing', 'Buying', 'best', 'tie', 'working', 'towards', 'buff', 'body', 'torturing', 'call', 'girl', 'route', 'same', 'himAll', 'treated', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'darkness', 'watch', 'how', 'time', 'murder', 'first', 'speech', 'philosophical', 'implications', 'vapid', '1980s', 'songs', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'Greatest', 'Love', 'All', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'Hip', 'Be', 'Square', 'violence', 'ironic', 'funny', 'are', 'able', 'focus', 'social', 'satire', 'not', 'lose', 'points', 'moral', 'outrage.Bateman', 'empty', 'narsicistic', 'very', 'core', 'so', 'entire', 'yuppie', 'environment', 'chosen', 'murders', 'executions', 'when', 'asked', 'meant', 'say', 'Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'Lines', 'are', 'layered', 'American', 'Psycho', 'one', 'action', 'akin', 'other.Bateman', 'cold', 'killer', 'persona', 'not', 'unique', 'shark', 'pool', 'just', 'shark', 'big', 'enough', 'take', 'instincts', 'level', 'Cutthroat', 'business', 'deals', 'murder', 'zero', 'sum', 'game', 'here', 'sociopath', 'rules.And', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'when', 'watch', 'Bateman', 'play', 'game', 'American', 'Psycho']",American Psycho VHS

His life consists of meaningless ritual and routine. Patrick has no sense of who he is or what he is doing. He is only aware of his own greed and inner hatred for all around him. He's a perfect physical specimen, perfectly wrapped in designer suits. His self-pampering shower regimen is a wonder to behold! When Patrick has sex with two women at once, he only notices his own reflection in the mirror. Patrick is a narcissist with no discernable personality. On the exterior, he is handsome, well groomed, and ""together"", while his interior is a frenzy of violence and death. Patrick is coming apart. He is no longer able to keep his inner deadness at bay. His friends are as unaware of his problems as they are of their own, living only to burn up the vast amounts of money they make in the most impressive ways possible. Patrick finally snaps, releasing his inner beast to murder those who he sees as unlike himself, which turns out to be anyone / everyone who comes in contact with him. To add to this insanity, things happen to make it unclear whether Patrick has actually killed anyone at all. Is he a prolific serial-killer or does he just have an over active and demented fantasy life? He's confused and so are we. He watches porno and slasher flicks which mysteriously look like events in his life. He carries one victim right out the front door of his penthouse apartment building, and loads it into the trunk of a cab. This leaves a long, wide trail of blood right in plain sight of many passers-by. Did this even happen? No one is certain. I loved this movie's view of the 1980s, especially the ridiculous nightlife and empty headed music. Patrick and his fellow business sharks are more plastic than flesh and blood with no concern for anyone but themselves. Patrick wants to fit in with them, but his own lack of a soul causes him nothing but misery. He is truly a repulsive creature, a living falsehood, a homicidal maniac with no real reason to kill. Patrick is the good-looking bottle of poison. Do not touch, unless you want to die! I found Patrick's utter void to be far more disturbing than the violence he perpetrates. He is totally lost, without hope or any idea of how to live. His misogeny is just a symptom of his own terminal condition. Patrick is a walking corpse.

71795,A38TA13FXZC7V0,0783243499,"Blake Watson ""===Blake===""","[0, 1]","Summary: if you can laugh at over-the-top violence (which is not especially graphic, any controversy notwithstanding) and if you like social satire, this is worth a watch. Or, if you really like Christian Bale. Competent direction and filmaking aside, his performance is the keystone.This is one of those movies (like the book) that is =bound= to be misunderstood.  It's really not meant to be taken literally, and the movie increasingly makes that apparent, as in one scene where Christian Bale's date doesn't notice him putting down plastic on all the furniture (in preparation for the gore to follow) or another where he runs naked and screaming through an apartment building wielding a running chainsaw and not a soul notices.Scenes like these are definite high points, both humorous and horrifying, and driving home the filmmaker's point (about soulless, faceless businessmen) with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.At times, however, the vision is less clear. I suspect that the MPAA, or maybe just concern over what the MPAA would allow, took a lot of the needed edge off this film.  My rating is for the R-rated, as-seen-in-theaters version.Also, the ending is a sort of twist.  But it only works as a twist if you've been taking the movie literally, which is very hard to do. (Some people had this problem with &quot;Fight Club&quot;, too. I didn't but the two movies are only superficially similar.)Keep in mind, though, this isn't a movie with a lot of sympathy toward any of the characters. There's not much chance that you're going to identify with Bateman, and ultimately we're moved from a deatched loathing to a detached pity, which makes it an entirely different experience from other movies which address similar themes. It's not like &quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&quot;, where Henry is this sort of nice guy with a small problem (a penchant toward murder) but more like &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; without the characters of Claire and Hannibal Lechter.I hope that gives some idea of what to expect from this movie.

Like &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; many people may have already made up their minds about this movie long before they even consider watching it.Like &quot;The Fight Club, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is a movie that could not be more misunderstood. Sure, this is about a psychopath on the most childishly obvious of all levels, but most of all this is satire on the yuppies of the mid to late 80's. It is an exploration in the hollow, meaningless existence of a rich Wall Street stock broker. A man who's life is so consumed by greed and power lunches that he can only find salvation whilst murdering someone. All the best scenes of &quot;American Psycho&quot; occur in the first three quarters of an hour. Christian Bale meticulously describes his morning routine with hilarious results and constantly tries to explain the significance of 1980's pop music. &quot;The Greatest Love of All's transcendant beauty makes it by far Whitney Houston's most accomplished record&quot; he claims, before butchering two girls.

The film doesn't rely on violence as much as it does dark comedy. If it did it would have had a much bigger reception in the box office. When I saw this film I felt it was very reminiscent of Hitchcock. What I don't understand is why the NC-17 rating on the film for those small differences? But you miss little in the R rated as opposed to unrated version.This film is so Hitchcock-esque I am suprised I did not catch a cameo of Mary Harron on-screen.This film was darkly funny, but not nearly as darkly funny as the book. I wish Harron would have caught on to the manic episodes that Bateman has in the book.The focus on male vanity makes this film such a comic riff on males. Where this movie fails is that it should have been more focused on the insanity of the eighties zeitgiest. It was more focused on the pure male rage and reverse psychology male bashing.This narrative is that of a Wall St. New York city setting. This film could have used a NYC backdrop rather than soundstages and Toronto Canada. The Canadian psycho really turned me off.Christian Bale gives a great performance of elitist Ivy League scum. This film is him. Though if the film were to have starred DiCaprio there may have been funding for a NYC backdrop and more time to cover the facets missed.

I say this because the majority of the film is really about Patrick Bateman's pitiful attempt to define himself through his obsession with his model-like appearance, his outlandish purchases (such as two Robert Longo drawings in his living room), music selections, and his choices in nightclubs and restaurants. The man is adrift with no real meaning in his life, and thus this is why he is ""psycho"".He demeans women, seeing them as little more than sex objects or status symbols. He is engaged to a woman (played by Reese Witherspoon) who sees men in the same way he sees women, which is convenient for a while but eventually results in a rupture of the relationship.He is hyper competitive and overly sensitive to the trappings of success. He becomes especially competitive with a colleague Paul Allen (played by Jared Leto) who has gained recognition that Patrick lacks and seeks.Early in the film Patrick lapses into psychotic halucinatory behavior, thinking that he is killing the women he picks up and the collegues who out shine him at work. We are given considerable hints throughout the film that his murders are figments of his imagination. I realize that some viewers will not interpret the film in this manner at all, but I suggest they carefully watch the film and seek the clues that Patrick is hallucinating and thus imaging that his desire to kill is in fact overt behaviors rather than impulsive thoughts.So why is he an American Psycho? Because he is a terrible empty shell of a person, driven to self definition by the American marketplace. The poor fellow had no original opinions. He actually memorizes CD covers as substitutes for developing an original opinion of the pop music that is integrated throughout the film.And yet, in some ways this really is a horror film, for what could be more horrible that a meaningless existance? The author of the book, Bret Easton Ellis, would let us know that many people experience this horror every day.The film is actually very good and unfortunately misunderstood and underestimated by most viewers.",4,Existential satire disguised as a horror film,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2169,"['watching', 'film', 'twice', 'am', 'opinion', 'really', 'satire', 'rather', 'horror', 'film', 'say', 'majority', 'film', 'really', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'define', 'obsession', 'model-like', 'appearance', 'outlandish', 'purchases', 'such', 'two', 'Robert', 'Longo', 'drawings', 'living', 'room', 'music', 'selections', 'choices', 'nightclubs', 'restaurants', 'man', 'adrift', 'real', 'meaning', 'life', 'thus', 'why', 'psycho', '.He', 'demeans', 'women', 'seeing', 'little', 'more', 'sex', 'objects', 'status', 'symbols', 'engaged', 'woman', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'men', 'same', 'way', 'women', 'convenient', 'while', 'eventually', 'results', 'rupture', 'relationship.He', 'hyper', 'competitive', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'trappings', 'success', 'especially', 'competitive', 'colleague', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'played', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'gained', 'recognition', 'Patrick', 'lacks', 'seeks.Early', 'film', 'Patrick', 'psychotic', 'halucinatory', 'behavior', 'thinking', 'killing', 'women', 'up', 'collegues', 'who', 'out', 'shine', 'work', 'are', 'given', 'considerable', 'hints', 'film', 'murders', 'are', 'figments', 'imagination', 'realize', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'interpret', 'film', 'manner', 'suggest', 'carefully', 'watch', 'film', 'seek', 'clues', 'Patrick', 'hallucinating', 'thus', 'imaging', 'desire', 'kill', 'fact', 'overt', 'behaviors', 'rather', 'impulsive', 'thoughts.So', 'why', 'American', 'Psycho', 'terrible', 'empty', 'shell', 'person', 'driven', 'self', 'definition', 'American', 'marketplace', 'poor', 'fellow', 'had', 'original', 'opinions', 'actually', 'CD', 'covers', 'substitutes', 'developing', 'original', 'opinion', 'pop', 'music', 'integrated', 'film.And', 'yet', 'ways', 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'horrible', 'meaningless', 'existance', 'author', 'book', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'would', 'let', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'experience', 'horror', 'day.The', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'misunderstood', 'underestimated', 'most', 'viewers']",American Psycho VHS

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[0, 0]","Despite its title and a considerable amount of bloodshed, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is a superbly witty and satirical film. The film is ostensibly about a serial murderer who happens to be fabulously wealthy, handsome, fit, and successful, but it is really a sarcastic critique of the money culture that defined the nineteen eighties.Patrick Bateman is a twenty-seven year old CEO who lives in the late 1980s and spends his leisure time in exclusive restaurants and clubs with his peers. He has occasional love affairs so meaningless that he can&#8217;t be troubled to remove his trousers during epidermal frictional activity, and of course, he kills people. Bateman is an odd bird who is obsessed with the comparative quality of business cards and who possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary (i.e. 1980s) music.Bateman&#8217;s homicidal impulses are frequently governed by his intense hatred of the superficial world around him. (spoiler).The message of this film is that in the yuppie culture of the late eighties, even if you were a self-confessing murderer, people would not be able to see you for who you were. In a sense, Bateman, the murderer, is like other extreme characters in literature such as Werther, Pechorin, and Merseault. Like his literary predecessors, Bateman is alienated by the superficial society around him and is driven to extreme forms of reaction against it. In a notable scene, Bateman brings two call girls to his apartment and commands them to debase themselves in front of him. Later, as he thrusts his tube steak in and out of their love pockets he makes ridiculous posses in front of a mirror, essentially laughing at himself.To its credit, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is not a clinical or horrorific film. While serial killing is certainly a grizzly subject, it is a more a device and a motif than a theme in this movie. Much of the killing is performed off camera. What homicide we do see is stylized to the point of being ridiculous. In a wonderful way, the film goes out of its way to assure us that its concerned with satire, and a social critique not with simulating brutality.",4,A satircal view of the eighties with incidental killing,1004486400,"10 31, 2001",2001,2134,"['title', 'considerable', 'amount', 'bloodshed', '8220', 'American', 'Psycho', '8221', 'superbly', 'witty', 'satirical', 'film', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'serial', 'murderer', 'who', 'be', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'handsome', 'fit', 'successful', 'really', 'sarcastic', 'critique', 'money', 'culture', 'defined', 'nineteen', 'eighties.Patrick', 'Bateman', 'twenty-seven', 'year', 'old', 'CEO', 'who', 'late', '1980s', 'leisure', 'time', 'exclusive', 'restaurants', 'clubs', 'peers', 'occasional', 'love', 'affairs', 'so', 'meaningless', 'can', '8217', 'be', 'troubled', 'remove', 'trousers', 'epidermal', 'frictional', 'activity', 'course', 'people', 'Bateman', 'odd', 'bird', 'who', 'obsessed', 'comparative', 'quality', 'business', 'cards', 'who', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'contemporary', 'i.e', '1980s', 'music.Bateman', '8217', 'homicidal', 'impulses', 'are', 'frequently', 'governed', 'intense', 'hatred', 'superficial', 'world', 'spoiler', 'message', 'film', 'yuppie', 'culture', 'late', 'eighties', 'even', 'were', 'self-confessing', 'murderer', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'who', 'were', 'sense', 'Bateman', 'murderer', 'other', 'extreme', 'characters', 'literature', 'such', 'Werther', 'Pechorin', 'Merseault', 'literary', 'predecessors', 'Bateman', 'alienated', 'superficial', 'society', 'driven', 'extreme', 'forms', 'reaction', 'notable', 'scene', 'Bateman', 'two', 'call', 'girls', 'apartment', 'debase', 'front', 'Later', 'tube', 'steak', 'love', 'pockets', 'ridiculous', 'posses', 'front', 'mirror', 'essentially', 'laughing', 'himself.To', 'credit', '8220', 'American', 'Psycho', '8221', 'not', 'clinical', 'horrorific', 'film', 'serial', 'killing', 'certainly', 'grizzly', 'subject', 'more', 'device', 'motif', 'theme', 'movie', 'Much', 'killing', 'performed', 'off', 'camera', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'stylized', 'point', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'wonderful', 'way', 'film', 'way', 'assure', 'concerned', 'satire', 'social', 'critique', 'not', 'simulating', 'brutality']",American Psycho VHS

And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears ""Murders and Executions"" is interchangeable with ""Mergers and Acquisitions.""The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman.The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/4",4,Can't Take the Jungle Out of the Man,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2970,"['would', 'argue', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'evolved', 'far', 'primate', 'days', 'human', 'males', 'still', 'have', 'loads', 'aggression', 'animalistic', 'behavior', 'need', 'get', 'out', 'best', 'efforts', 'civilization', 'general', 'neuter', 'aggression', 'still', 'go', 'someplace', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'American', 'Psycho', 'out', 'wrong', 'places', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'one', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Wall', 'Street', 'yuppie', 'day', 'ax', 'murderer', 'night', 'Patrick', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'edge', 'fakeness', 'not', 'just', 'suits', 'empty', 'conversations', 'either', 'peeing', 'contests', 'who', 'best', 'haircut', 'apartment', 'business', 'card', 'talk', 'problems', 'really', 'nobody', 'listens', 'nobody', 'listens', 'period', 'ears', 'Murders', 'Executions', 'interchangeable', 'Mergers', 'Acquisitions', 'film', 'big', 'punch', 'face', 'egotistical', 'businessmen', '1980', 'particular', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'overdone', 'overacted', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'great', 'performance', 'robotic', 'phony', 'arrogant', 'absurd', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'have', '3', 'prostitutes', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'admire', 'mirror', 'doing', 'so', 'while', 'flexing', 'biceps', 'More', 'anything', 'militantly', 'materialistic', 'Dexter', 'mixed', 'Jim', 'Profit', 'only', 'style', 'profile', 'taking', 'ax', 'co-workers', 'head', 'whole', 'point', 'made', 'clear', 'final', 'scene', 'people', 'may', 'truly', 'believe', 'only', 'glossy', 'veneer', 'matters', 'really', 'inside', 'Just', 'people', 'make', 'enough', 'cash', 'swim', 'Scrooge', 'McDuck', 'style', ""n't"", 'mean', 'behavior', 'excusable', 'Harron', 'modern', 'businessman', 'American', 'Psycho', 'too', 'fitting', 'make', 'business', 'world', 'conscious', 'soul', 'must', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'must', 'be', 'turned', 'Patrick', 'Bateman.The', 'film', 'great', 'success', 'horror', 'movie', 'villain', 'Patrick', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'backstories', 'ever', 'Every', 'scene', 'great', 'energy', 'even', 'Bale', 'little', 'place', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'something', 'conflict', 'presented', 'when', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'up', 'play', 'detective', 'case', 'one', 'Patrick', 'murders', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'never', 'quite', 'wrapped', 'up', 'would', 'also', 'admit', 'awhile', 'got', 'little', 'sick', 'swimming', 'debaucherous', 'waters', 'may', 'never', 'tire', 'having', 'dirty', 'bloody', 'eventually', 'did', 'character', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'what', 'up', 'love', 'cheesy', '80', 'music', 'scene', 'where', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'will', 'leave', 'stunned', 'hypnotized', 'male', 'need', 'aggression', ""n't"", 'going', 'anyplace', 'need', 'find', 'good', 'way', 'channel', '.otherwise', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Iraq', 'Wars', 'hands', '***3/4']",American Psycho VHS

71823,A30B8DOR8U4LH,0783243499,Christine Menendez,"[0, 0]","I have just watched this film for the second time, and have finally come to some real conclusions about it. I have also read the novel, by Ellis. First let me say that the film is both a brilliant adaptation of the novel as well as being only a pale shadow of it. The adaptation was brilliant in that it adapted the most significant parts of the novel in terms of theme, rather than turning the film into a gore fest. Yes, this film is about a serial killer, but it is also about alienation and emptiness and the utter despair of having everything but having nothing worthwhile. I think that often the real meaning of the book and the film go unnoticed. Yes, it is a brilliant film in terms of cinematography and plot, but what does it all mean? Patrick Bateman, our protagonist, says at the beginning that he does not really exist, and throughout the film he is always mistaken for someone else. I think this film has a great deal to say about alienation, about the emptiness of modern life. It really has the same theme as Fight Club, though that theme is represented differently. But that theme still comes through very strongly: that modern society has lost touch with reality, that it is estranged and unfocused, and that people need something more than lots of money, high rise apartments and perfect bodies. Bateman becomes a killer because he needs to feel something just as the guys in Fight Club initiated fights in order to really feel, to feel that they were alive. I think that American Psycho is more a general comment on society than it is on serial killers. But it stands as an important commentary, a very valuable film. I would have given it a full five stars, but the fact is that the film is not for everyone.And, if you have any doubts, just seeing Christian Bale's performance is worth the entire film. Why he didn't get the Oscar is beyond my understanding. This is one of the greatest performances on film I have ever seen.",4,what you see is not necessarily what you get,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,1947,"['have', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'finally', 'come', 'real', 'conclusions', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'novel', 'Ellis', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'film', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'only', 'pale', 'shadow', 'adaptation', 'was', 'brilliant', 'adapted', 'most', 'significant', 'parts', 'novel', 'terms', 'theme', 'rather', 'turning', 'film', 'gore', 'fest', 'Yes', 'film', 'serial', 'killer', 'also', 'alienation', 'emptiness', 'utter', 'despair', 'having', 'everything', 'having', 'nothing', 'worthwhile', 'think', 'often', 'real', 'meaning', 'book', 'film', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Yes', 'brilliant', 'film', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'what', 'mean', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'protagonist', 'beginning', 'not', 'really', 'exist', 'film', 'always', 'mistaken', 'someone', 'else', 'think', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'say', 'alienation', 'emptiness', 'modern', 'life', 'really', 'same', 'theme', 'Fight', 'Club', 'theme', 'represented', 'differently', 'theme', 'still', 'very', 'strongly', 'modern', 'society', 'lost', 'touch', 'reality', 'estranged', 'unfocused', 'people', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'lots', 'money', 'high', 'rise', 'apartments', 'perfect', 'bodies', 'Bateman', 'killer', 'feel', 'something', 'just', 'guys', 'Fight', 'Club', 'initiated', 'fights', 'order', 'really', 'feel', 'feel', 'were', 'alive', 'think', 'American', 'Psycho', 'more', 'general', 'comment', 'society', 'serial', 'killers', 'important', 'commentary', 'very', 'valuable', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'everyone.And', 'have', 'doubts', 'just', 'seeing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'understanding', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",American Psycho VHS

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[2, 4]","Imagine a combination of  Bonfire of the Vanities, Fight Club and Theatre of Death and you'll get an idea of what the film American Psycho is like-- Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.  It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life-style in sick and sadistic fashion.  Well that's not exactly true --  in Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best-seller the victims were mostly  mercilessly tortured before they were brutally killed and every detail was grimly described.  It was a very disturbing book.  It almost wasn't published.The film however, barely touches on the sadism and misogyny of the book.  It's a poseur film, skimming the surfaces of already overly- skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.This compromise is significant when compared to the book, the book took the plunge and never came up for air.  That's why the book just won't go completely away, it might not have a lot on its mind, but it sure cuts right to the bone.  Forget about the book, though, few have actually read it.  Quite a few bought it and started to read it, but most didn't finish it.  It's too gross, too bloody, too bleak, too sick, and too repetitious.I was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.  Perhaps  watching the yuppies of the 80's getting their deserved bashing is the updated equivalent of snobby rich folks who wind up getting hit with pies in Three Stooges shorts.  It's quite fun.Another big reason for enjoying  it all so much is Christian Bale.  He plays the part with the kind of put on airs the reminded  me of some not quite human mix of Vincent Price and James Mason trapped inside a California type male model.  And though the performance is mannered, it doesn't feel forced.  It's not a performance coming from a stage actor ,who would be too keenly aware of when an audience might be reacting or laughing.  It's the type of performance a film actor like DeNiro, would have delivered to us when he was younger.  Now Bale hardly looks like an average  New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining. It carries the film.Patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.  Patrick plays the competitive game with his co-workers, making sure he has the latest gadgets, the right shoes, the expensive tailored suits.  He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.  He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  However, he barely has his own identity.  A running joke in the film has him being mistaken for one of his co-workers.  A key scene in the film involves an in-depth analysis and discussion about Business Cards.  Low key, but specially designed business cards that the young Yuppie's talk about and become envious of.Eventually we realize that Patrick Bateman (reminiscent of the similarly named Norman Bates) has a strange hobby.  He likes to kill.  We first see his dark side when a street person begs him for money.  Suddenly, Bateman savagely stabs the pitiful beggar.  Afterward he straightens his clothing, sighs, and goes about his business.  Just a way to relieve some stress, a way to cope with the pressure.In other words, here's a Yuppie who has completely twisted any sense of morals to believe someone else's life is as insignificant as a two year old BMW.  Can he really get away with this? We find out he sure can.  He seems unstoppable.The film could have wound up being flat and stale.  But it never is.  It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.  This is because there is a  feminist viewpoint brought to the film by  Mary Harron who directed and co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.  The film's Patrick Bateman is a selfish, self obsessed, type A driven male.  A fragile, preening creature that is not an atypical Hollywood movie serial killer nor a killer who murders when in a  homicidal rage.  In fact this killer prefers to control the stage he kills in, often able to provide his own background music, maybe something by Huey Lewis, or  maybe something by Phil Collins. Patrick Bateman is a big fan of songs like It's Hip to Be Square and SuSudio.  To Patrick Bateman, killing is his true orgasm.  He can  control himself for short periods of time, but he's  weak, he's male and he's gonna blow sooner or later.  He's going to kill and kill again.  Maybe all this killing is even all in his mind -- nothing more than a twisted yuppie fantasy. Then again, perhaps it's not.  Whatever he can't completely control --he kills.  If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,-- he kills.Willem Dafoe playing a detective on Bateman's trail was a great idea, but nothing is done with it, and Reese Witherspoon seems the kind of future trophy wife a guy like Bateman would have.  Jared Leto  plays  the kind of Yuppie scum everyone hates.  In fact we hate this guy so much he makes Bateman palatable.  His character is named Paul Allen which is funnier now, (particularly to someone in the NorthWest) than it was when the book was written.Chloe (Boys Don't Cry) Sevigny as a secretary who has a crush on Bateman makes a real impression.  She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.  Without her performance the film would be a completely cold exercise in style. Cara Seymour plays a prostitute Bateman picks up to play games.  She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self-loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short.It's a sick black comedy with some truly twisted ideas. The gore in the film however is not as plentiful as you might think and none of it feels real enough to be disturbing.",3,"Yuppie,Psycho Killer Black Comedy.",978566400,"01 4,

I just think those ideas should have been played up a little more, more in an effort to set the ideas and ideals of the 1980's and the main character, Patrick Bateman, who is a walking stereotype of everything the Reagan-era was felt to represent against the sick and twisted very non-stereotypical actions he performed.Sadly, I think this movie didnt fare as well as it could have in the theatres because they advertised it to be ""horror"", when it was meant to be ""horrific"".

I was never a fan of Brett Easton Ellis but when he published the novel on which this film is based, I knew he was a rank amateur and that little more than luck had fueled his career.  His use of extreme violence was only a means to get attention for an otherwise paltry manuscript.  No -- or very minimal -- artistry involved.I've heard that the director of this film wanted to rescue the story.  And she did a wonderful job.  This isn't the first time this has happened in film.  In fact, compare another very famous film -- Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; -- to the novel by Robert Bloch on which it was based and you can immediately see a parallel.  Even bad novels may contain the seed of a great idea.  And we are lucky sometimes to have movie directors capable of reworking them and creating art.The actor, Christian Bale, is phenomenal in this movie.  I had never seen him before but I will be looking for him in other roles.  Here he plays the title character perfectly.  I can't think of anyone better to play Patrick Bateman.The rest of the cast is excellent.  And I am once again pleased to see the beautiful Chloe Sevigny.

The movie is confusing, unappealing,  and full of irrelevance.The movie is about an yuppie on Wall Street who  is trying to be better than everyone else.  Obsessed with success, sex,  and into drugs, Patrick Batemen works on Wall Street by day and plays  serial killer by night.  Or so it seems.  The ending of this movie is so  confusing, it led me to believe that some of the killing sequences are  Batemen's fantasies.  Specifically, in one scene, Batemen kills Paul Allen.  Later, he goes to Allen's apartment and kills two ladies and stores them  in the closet.  Subsequently, he visits the apartment and discovers it's  sold and no one seems to think anyone died there.  At the end, Batemen's  lawyer tells him that Paul is alive and that he has seen him in London.  So, what happened?The movie also failed to be effective as a  suspense/horror/thriller due to its uneven pace.  At times, it slows to a  crawl, focusing on dinners, meetings that have little to add to the entire  story.  There are also a number of lines that are repeated for no apparent  reason.  For example, Batemen tells several people, &quot;I have to return  videos to the store.&quot;  Did I miss something?Unfortunately, it  appears that the viewer needs to  read the book first in order to  understand what is going on.

Here, seemingly, at least some if not all of Patrick Bateman's violence apparently came to pass only in the space between the sick (though impeccably fashionable) Yuppie's ears. In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low-key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does  a superb job of embodying a self-loving, celebrity-obsessed, brand name worshipping billionaire playboy, who tells us in lingering detail how he just happens to slay random people in his spare time. Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role. The extended ""cut"" of American Psycho restores some of the nudity and a little of the violence left out in the theatrical release six years ago. What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess. Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble-brained fianc&eacute;e, to a downtrodden Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's loyal secretary, to Samantha Mathis as a pill popping ""hotbod"" whose dead-end drug addiction amuses the sadistic Bateman.

No!), it's also a savagely funny satire on consumer culture and the general gluttony that is our country.  Christian Bale gives a knockout, powerhouse, I only wish there were enough glowing agitives to describe, performance as Patick Bateman, a yuppie VP whose 'nightly bloodlust starts to slip into his days.'  That's not to say it's a particularly deep or profound performance, in fact it's that lack of depth that makes him such a marvel to watch.  You see Bateman's both an everyman and a nobody - a nameless, faceless drone steering his way through an ocean of disinterest.  Probably the most frightening aspect is the fact that he fits in so well.  The reason being that nobody really listens to what one another has to say, they're all just waiting for their turn to talk.  Fans of the novel, and I must confess I am one, in seek of graphic violence might want to look elsewhere becuase it's not the bloodshed that makes this movie so good.  It's the way it holds a mirror to us and forces some self-examination - something alot of us are very resistant to.  In the end it's a totally refreshing expierence, a movie that's actually not afraid to be original.  And it's nice to see, especially given the poor Seven-ripoffs we've seen over the past five years.

71842,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,0783243499,Daniel McInnis,"[5, 7]","Mesmerizing adaptation of the controversial novel by the same name, American Psycho scores on every conceivable level.  As a psychological thriller there are none better.  As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.  And as a black comedy it's rivaled only by the 1989 cult classic Vampires Kiss, to which it bears a striking resemblence.  In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.Christian Bale, his name above the title for the first time in his career, stars as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who may or may not be a serial killer, depending on your point of view.  By that I mean, second time director Mary Harron (avoiding the sophomore slump) leaves the movie open to interruption.  And if you're looking for easy answers there aren't any here.  The euphoric tone in which the story unfolds seems to suggest, in retrospect, that the movie may actually be the elaborate fantasy of a very deranged individual.  Or maybe it's the setting, Reagan-era New York, that makes it seem so alien.  Either way it's a tremendously thought-provoking film that should have people talking for a long time to come.Just imagine if Leonardo DiCaprio were in the lead?  It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.  But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!  It's not that Chris Bale looses himself in the character so much as Patrick Bateman has no character, and it's that understanding that he brings to the role.  He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.  And he does, which is most disturbing of all.  Not the blood or the gore, which is toned down from the book, but the fact that he fits in so well.  Maybe that's the most tellling statement of all, to say that society bears the responsibilty for having created the Patrick Bateman's of the world.His rampage begins by taking the life of a homeless man, to which he feels his financial status entitles him to.  He moves on to supposed &quot;productive&quot; members of society who, despite all their money, never seem to be doing much work.  It's then, after killing Paul Allen (Jared Leto), that he finds himself being questioned by a private investigator (Willem Dafoe), seemingly more interested in flirting with him than interrogating him.  I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.Especially interesting of that bunch is Cara Seymour in a performance so drop dead hysterical (excuse the in joke) that she'll have you laughing long after the movie's over.  She plays Christie, a street walker who falls victim to Bateman's most violent fantasy.  This is one of those tongue-in-cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.Of course, I don't mean to suggest this for everybody, because as most of the best films usually are, it's of an acquired taste.

71843,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,0783243499,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[5, 11]","The only words that were coming to my mind while watching AMERICAN PSYCHO were &quot; Stop it ! It's too much &quot;. Too much blood, too much satire, too much of everything. I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel but what is certain is that literature allows a lot of liberties cinema simply can not translate in images unless you are Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles.AMERICAN PSYCHO tries to describe a peculiar world, the world of the 1980 New-York yuppies. These yuppies are very snob without the cultural background found in, let's say for instance, the englishmen of the first part of the XXth century. They are like empty shells, living a life of fast money, expensive restaurants and uninteresting social activities. Well, they don't particularly bother me as long as they stay in their artificial world. And I can easily imagine to what kind of excess easy money can drive a man who has not a solid moral history.If I have understood well the purpose of the authors of AMERICAN PSYCHO, the movie, apart of this harsch critique of the yuppie world, would like to convince us that money and power could eventually lead someone to believe that he can be a new god, deciding who has the right to live and who should die, without being worried by consequences. Patrick Bateman, after a slow start, becomes less and less prudent and finally commit murders in the open light. Like the serial killers he admires, he wants unconsciously to be recognized. The movie often hesitates between the satire, the not so fairy tale, the horror and the moral genre, so feel free to have your own opinion about it.A DVD zone Manhattan (New-York only ).",2,NO  MORE  MR  NICE  GUY,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,1644,"['only', 'words', 'were', 'coming', 'mind', 'watching', 'AMERICAN', 'PSYCHO', 'were', 'quot', 'Stop', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'Too', 'much', 'blood', 'too', 'much', 'satire', 'too', 'much', 'everything', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'what', 'certain', 'literature', 'lot', 'liberties', 'cinema', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'translate', 'images', 'are', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'Orson', 'Welles.AMERICAN', 'PSYCHO', 'describe', 'peculiar', 'world', 'world', '1980', 'New-York', 'yuppies', 'yuppies', 'are', 'very', 'snob', 'cultural', 'background', 'found', 'let', 'say', 'instance', 'englishmen', 'first', 'part', 'XXth', 'century', 'are', 'empty', 'shells', 'living', 'life', 'fast', 'money', 'expensive', 'restaurants', 'uninteresting', 'social', 'activities', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'bother', 'as', 'long', 'stay', 'artificial', 'world', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'what', 'kind', 'excess', 'easy', 'money', 'can', 'drive', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'solid', 'moral', 'history.If', 'have', 'understood', 'well', 'purpose', 'authors', 'AMERICAN', 'PSYCHO', 'movie', 'apart', 'harsch', 'critique', 'yuppie', 'world', 'would', 'like', 'convince', 'money', 'power', 'could', 'eventually', 'lead', 'someone', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'new', 'god', 'deciding', 'who', 'right', 'live', 'who', 'should', 'die', 'being', 'worried', 'consequences', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'slow', 'start', 'less', 'less', 'prudent', 'finally', 'commit', 'murders', 'open', 'light', 'serial', 'killers', 'unconsciously', 'be', 'recognized', 'movie', 'often', 'satire', 'not', 'so', 'fairy', 'tale', 'horror', 'moral', 'genre', 'feel', 'free', 'have', 'own', 'opinion', 'it.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'Manhattan', 'New-York', 'only']",American Psycho VHS

Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was in American Psycho where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think the scene where he chops Jared Leto up is the actor's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three scenes. Christy, take off your robe. Watch the brilliant ensemble acting of Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe. You can practically hear every nuance of every voice. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of thespian craftsmanship, the sheer delivery, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the scene with Chloe Sevigny. In this scene, Christian Bale addresses the problems of abusive political authority. Him trying to feed a kitten into an ATM machine is the most moving film scene of the 2000s about monogamy and commitment. The scene is extremely uplifting. The lines are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in movies. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your *beep*. Christian Bale's solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially movies like The Machinist and The Prestige. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Christian Bale works best within the confines of this movie than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is American Psycho, a great, great movie.

Yeah, I know it's tough to get reservations there, but trust me---I can get them anytime. I'm connected with the Maitre D'. Dinner, say Friday, say eight? Where do you work out, anyway?Since we're talking Movers and Shakers, let me introduce you to my homeskillet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who completely owns the film)---he's the go-to guy in Mergers & Acquisitions at Pierce & Pierce, Wall Street investment banking hotshot, hooking up with Upper East Side fashion maven and society diva Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon, compulsively consuming)---the lucky dog!---and frankly, between the two of us, the guy you want to talk to to cuff your links, tie your knots, and give you the low-down on the best shoes to accent your Hugo Boss or Armani. PC before PC was cool. Big on the enviroment, nuclear freeze, health care, education, helping out the poor and downtrodden, stamping out genocide in Sri Lanka. Boy Next Door.Monster and Serial Killer.Yep, Patrick is big on buying industrial nail guns, stapling witless prostitutes to the floor, touching them up with a little acid facial, topping that off with some mace, and storing their heads in his Sub-Zero high-end refrigerator/freezer unit. He wants to fit in, our Patrick, but you know, a man's got to have hobbies. Norman Bates said it perfectly when he noted ""we all go a little crazy sometimes"".OK, granted, bad example. But Jesus, a man's got to---you know---*vent* sometimes.When I heard they were making Bret Easton Ellis's study in psychosis and carnal yuppiedom ""American Pyscho"" into a movie, I thought it couldn't be done. Then I heard Mary Harron was helming it, and I sighed with bliss: Harron's ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" was a kind of cinematic kindred spirit to American Psycho, both delving into the mental states of complete gibbering lunatics no one took seriously.I see you're staring at my shoes---they're Allen-Edmonds wingtips (USD 795). Oh, you're not? Where was I? Is that Donald Trump?Anyway, the flick chronicles our man Bateman---a practical GQ fashion & hygiene expert, I might add!---in his days as Wall Street guru, his nights as impromptu surgeon. He's a great authority on Huey Lewis & the News, which you can hear on his state-of-the-art B&O; surround sound system (USD 25,000), accompanied by Bateman's ever-astute commentary---that is, if you can hear it over the screams.He exults in six-pack abs. He keeps his skin nice and taut and rosy with all sorts of unguents and admixtures. He has a great tan, compliments of his little tanning sarcophagus. He hits the club scene and comes home with dinner, dinner that talks and thinks and hopes. He keeps those abs bristling with daily workouts, accompanied to porn tapes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He'd better damn sure have a better business card than you.Harron takes liberties with Ellis's material, but captures the essentials like a champ. This isn't a gory flick---not by a longshot, given that the literary Bateman liked introducing a starving wharf rat into the nether regions of his victims---but it gets the point across.Bateman tearing through a high end West Side penthouse with a chainsaw (my God, the boy has good aim!). Bateman administering the coup de grace to a bum, then stomping the bum's cowering doggy to death. Bateman feeding a kitten to the friendly neighborhood ATM (it says FEED ME A KITTEN---honestly, could you resist? Not I!). Bateman despairing at being outdone by his wretched rival Paul Allen (the incomparable Jared Leto, smirking and smarmy to the exceptionally bitter end).From what's for dinner on the menu at New York's high end eateries (might I recommend the Dauphin Gratinois with the Lobster frappe?), to the existential agonies of getting a good table at Dorsia, to the shame of living in even a good Upper West Side apartment (with doorman), Harron nails the raw bloody guts of the No-Exit damnation lurking at the black, fetid, festering, maggot-ridden heart of High Society---or any society, for that matter. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula gives Harron full air support---and he should, since he did the camera-work for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Four Rooms. Stuff looks good here.Bale put me off on my first viewing---his campy smile, his goofy voice, his off-kilter mannerisms---but he's perfect. Bateman isn't in control, after all: he thinks his mask is slipping, when it's already on the floor and shunting down the drain.Frankly, all the acting is first-rate: Samantha Mathis Xanax'd to perfection as Bateman's mistress and free-range society delectation Courtney, Matt Ross as the hideous Luis Carruthers, Justin Theroux owning yet another bit part as Bryce, Josh Lucas note-perfect as McDermott, Chloe Sevigny is at her cringing, cloying best---my god, it's hard not to adore her---and Willem Dafoe as the police detective, looming like a stormcloud about to break that never really does, and proving---with his face alone---that Sam Raimi was off his rocker to even *think* about putting Dafoe in a mask as the Green Goblin. Fool.Some call this satire. Ignore them. This is pure, unadulterated horror; Pat Bateman's midnight outtings are consequence and causality of our wearing one too many masks to placate society: the Beast must get out! It must eat!Why are you staring at my tie (Forzieri, USD 275.00)? Nah, that's not blood---it's spaghetti sauce from lunch, silly.

71847,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0783243499,Darren,"[0, 0]","Bret Easton Ellis' satire of the Reagan Age is ultimately as subtle as a smart-bomb aimed at a gigantic red barn, but, while ugly, it's also funny, and director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner accentuate the funny stuff.  It's fitting that women helmed this project; it was probably the only way the film could get acceptably made without dredging back up the misogyny debate that swirled around the book when it was released in 1991, a decade prior to this film's release.  Some of the book's gorier depictions are eschewed, as is a scene where our yuppie stabs a six-year-old child to death.  Clearly, Harron and company didn't want people to simply get up and leave the theater in disgust.  However, the murders of men -- a fellow yuppie and a homeless man with his dog -- disturb much more than the murders of the women, which are limited to two (unlike the book, of course) and are presented in such a purposely B-movie manner that we're free to not take them very seriously.  Indeed, we're often led to ponder that we're seeing the dank recesses of Bale's deranged imagination and nothing more.  And so we get to Ellis' appalling thesis, presented in the form of a question: does it even matter if the events in the story are &#34;real&#34; or not?  Who out there really cares about yuppie sleazeballs?  Or homeless people?  Or prostitutes?  Do you miss them when they're not around?  Do you say prayers for them when you hear that they have been killed or murdered?  Ellis suggests that we don't care, and that &#34;Patrick Bateman&#34; is simply an extreme expression of our own heartlessness.  At first I thought it was odd that Amazon released this movie to Prime at Christmastime, but I wonder if this black satire is rather perfect for the holiday season after all.  The book and the movie hold up a mirror to us and say, &#34;How are you fundamentally different from this man?&#34;  For instance, if you vote &#34;No&#34; on tax referendums that would increase funding for homeless shelters, you're killing a homeless person just as surely as Bale does here.  You're just doing it indirectly.  Congratulations: you too are an American Psycho.  Ellis is a moralist of the highest order.If only he hadn't gummed up his novels with so much pointless hardcore sex and depictions of murder that reek of an abattoir.  The result is that his books aren't taken all that seriously when perhaps they should be.  But I suppose it's lucky that Harron doesn't ask us to take &#34;American Pyscho&#34; very seriously either, and so we can get the point of the fable and have a few belly-laughs along the way.  Among the funniest things here are the descriptions of 1980s' &#34;nouvelle cuisine&#34;, menu items like &#34;mud soup&#34; and &#34;charcoal arugula&#34; (whatever those are) and &#34;squid ravioli&#34; (shudder), presented in minuscule portions, artfully arranged and surrounded by drops of sauce of unnatural colors on plates the size of TV trays.  Bale's beauty regimen, involving physical workouts, facial peels, and sundry exfoliating &#34;gels&#34; that require a person to spend 30 minutes in the shower, is all the more hilarious because it's hardly an exaggeration for some folks out there.  And the dialogue, taken entirely from Ellis' novel, cracked ME up at least with its oddball phrasing and delivery.  The movie is strewn with exchanges like: &#34;Listen, Allen: squash.  Friday?&#34;  &#34;No can do.  I've got a rez at Dorsia.  The sea-urchin ceviche is OUTRAGEOUS there.&#34;  The style makes Mamet sound almost as florid as a bad Victorian romance.Speaking of delivery, it's Bale's show all the way.  Having obviously studied the vocal accents and cadences of news anchors and voice-over talent, Bale attains high comedy if only by just sounding so demented whenever he speaks.  (His delivery of the following: &#34;Hey Hamilton, have a holly jolly Christmas&#34; is practically a meme.)  Actually, I wonder if it hurts the movie's set-up a bit: I rather think that Bale stands out quite a bit among his fellows because of his creepy voice that makes him sound like he's forever reading advertising copy, when the idea should be to make him as much of a cipher as possible.  I also think Harron trowels it on a little too thickly by having Bale constantly criticize his secretary Chloe Sevigny's work wardrobe.  &#34;Wear a dress.  And high heels!  I like high heels!&#34;  Even in the caveman 80s, most women, and certainly the younger women, didn't stand for that behavior.  And there's a poorly staged gunfight that I think tries to mock scenes in action movies (Bale looks down in amazement at his pistol after one of its bullets blows a police cruiser sky-high), but the mocking tone is doubtless a cover for Harron's lack of either talent for, or budget to properly shoot, the sequence.  But these are cavils in what is an otherwise good time at the movies.  4 out of 5 stars.",4,The man in our mirror,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,4927,"['Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'satire', 'Reagan',

71849,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,0783243499,Dave,"[184, 193]","Based on Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel American Psycho, this film tells the story of an 80's yuppie named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) who works on Wall Street by day and kills people by night. Like the often misunderstood novel, the film is more of a dark social comedy than a real horror story. Bateman dresses and talks like all the other wealthy, young Wall Street crowd, and thus mistaken identity plays a big part in his getting away with gruesome murders again and again. Bateman's own grip on reality begins to blur over time and at various times throughout the movie it's quite obvious that Patrick's view of reality is a sick, homicidal dream of endless torture and killing. Even when Bateman confesses at one point, no one listens or seems to care. Everyone has their own agenda and the main concern of Bateman's friends is which extravagant restaurant to dine at next, or getting the latest and greatest business card to impress one another.Casting Christian Bale was a brilliant choice by director Mary Harron, who almost got fired from the project because of not choosing Leonardo DiCaprio for the starring role. I honestly don't think anyone could've captured Patrick Bateman's personality more flawlessly than Bale, who gave an extraordinary, chilling performance. And casting Reese Witherspoon as the prissy, bubble-brained Evelyn, who's engaged to Bateman but knows nothing of his psychotic, homicidal behavior, was a perfect choice. Much of the dialogue in the film is taken directly from Ellis' book, and the horrific violence of the book was toned down considerably, with much of it taking place off camera. Many viewers don't seem to appreciate the frequent humor in American Psycho, such as the various times Bateman says crazy things like, ""I'm into murders and executions"" that no one seems to hear. And his philosophical ramblings about the music of Huey Lewis & the News, Phil Collins, and Whitney Huston are hysterical!The new ""Killer Collector's Edition"" is a mixed bag as far as worthwhile special features go. The documentary ""From Book to Screen"" is in depth but instead of having new interviews with the stars there are mostly boring interviews with film critics. Plus, it seemed like there was way too much coverage of the novel and very little on the actual shooting of the film. There's a lame video essay read by some singer and a documentary on the `80s. Thankfully, there are several deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary) as well as several humorous trailers. My favorite special feature (and probably the main reason why you should by this edition) is the director's commentary which tells lots of entertaining behind the scenes info. And, the picture and sound quality are better than ever! American Psycho IS NOT a film for everyone, but for those who enjoy intelligent satires with a little horror mixed in, this modern classic is a definite must for your DVD collection! And before you judge or even watch this movie, you should read Ellis' novel to appreciate the whole, uncensored story.""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"" -P.

An era of all style, no substance, and a perfect setting for this searing indictment against male vanity and territoriality. Christain Bale gives a rare performance as Patrick Bateman, a business suit-clad serial killer whose charming smile and uncanny fashion sense just barely hides a seething hatred for women and disturbing psychotic impulses. This is a performance of true power and wit and Bale throws himself into the role without a hint of self-preservation, a rare quality for an actor. The men portrayed in this film are as empty as their lives, their existence marked only by their haircuts and designer suits. The Bateman character could easily be anyone in the film, they are all the same person, the only difference between them is where they hang out, who they have dinner with, the ease with which they get reservations. The character of Bateman is reduced to spouting off philosophies behind POP SONGS of all things in order to show that he has a single original thought in his head (and the sight of an empty, meaningless character reaching for meaning in something as empty and meaningless as a Whitney Houston song is extremely funny). When Bateman and company are sitting around a meeting table swapping business cards, the scene takes on a perverse meaning, as if they were swapping the size of their members. It all adds up to an extremely funny film for those who appreciate this type of satire. However, the film has a very dark side to it as well. The graphic nature of the violence in the novel has been toned down or removed, but it is shocking nonetheless as Bateman splits open the head of one of his rivals (off-screen, mind you) and then casually sits down and lights a cigar. The callousness and seeming inhumanity of Bateman is frightening. Director Mary Harron creates a beautiful film given it's subject matter and it looks like it cost millions more then it did to make. Add great supporting work by Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Samantha Mathis, and Chloe Sevigny (who shares the most memorable scene with Bale, a date in which they completely mis-read each other's motives) and you have a film that's as entertaining as it is thought-provoking.

But even though my initial reaction was negative, the images of the movie stayed with me and it was only after about a six month gestation period of sub-conscious reflection that I realized what the film was actually trying to accomplish.  I watched it again and realized to my untter astonishment that American Psycho is a witty, piercing satire, sometimes hilarious, sometimes terrifying, and always brilliant.  The best way to describe the movie is &quot;Fight Club&quot; with no pulled punches.  I am one of many that felt &quot;Fight Club&quot; was brilliant and I still consider it a slightly more rewarding movie than Psycho, but Psycho covers ground even &quot;Fight Club&quot; shied away from, it is disturbing, but nonetheless, it needed to be said.  The problem with Psycho, and what makes the satire so difficult to percieve, is that there are virtually no hints that the opposite of every presented scene is actually meant.  The movie is a criticism of our materialist culture, everybody is ultra-refined and meticulously groomed to the point where they look like they've just stepped off the front cover of a magazine and because they all look so similar (in one of the subtle humourous conventions that indicates the movie is a satire) nobody can keep anybody else's identy straight.  This misidentification allows Patrick Bateman (Played wonderfully by Christian Bale) to plan a series of murders in which he provides an alibi for himself by assuming the identity of one of the people he kills.  The obvious problem with this plan is that people mistake him for himself when he is disguised as somebody else.  I think the main reason I missed out on the humor of this film is that it walks so near to the ridiculous line that society toes anyway.  For example, it is almost impossible to make a satire on an action movie because action movies are so ridiculously exagurated to begin with.  But that is why American Psycho is brilliant, it puts a magnifying glass on a part of society we overlook and brings it into its horrific focus using primarilly the ideas that the society espouses itself.  The film is a tremendous artistic achievement and it is important that audiences don't give up on it too soon.  Like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; until you know what the movie is trying to achieve, it is an uncomfortable viewing experience.  But once you understand it, you see that the blood and the violence is totally necessary and justified in making a responsible comment about the ills of society that most immediatly need to be rectified.",4,You have to Watch this Twice to Understand It!,994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,2949,"['usually', 'pride', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'one', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'former', 'English', 'Literature', 'major', 'simply', 'assumed', 'had', 'developed', 'ability', 'pick', 'up', 'standard', 'movie', 'conventions', 'relatively', 'sophisticated', 'level', 'film', 'totally', 'confused', 'first', 'viewing', 'thought', 'was', 'needlessly', 'violent', 'top', 'purpose', 'even', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'negative', 'images', 'movie', 'stayed', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'month', 'gestation', 'period', 'sub-conscious', 'reflection', 'realized', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'watched', 'again', 'realized', 'untter', 'astonishment', 'American', 'Psycho', 'witty', 'piercing', 'satire', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'sometimes', 'terrifying', 'always', 'brilliant', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'movie', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'pulled', 'punches', 'am', 'one', 'many', 'felt', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'was', 'brilliant', 'still', 'consider', 'slightly', 'more', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'Psycho', 'Psycho', 'ground', 'even', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'shied', 'away', 'disturbing', 'nonetheless', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'problem', 'Psycho', 'satire', 'so', 'difficult', 'percieve', 'are', 'virtually', 'hints', 'opposite', 'presented', 'scene', 'actually', 'meant', 'movie', 'criticism', 'materialist', 'culture', 'everybody', 'ultra-refined', 'meticulously', 'groomed', 'point', 'where', 'look', ""'ve"", 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'front', 'cover', 'magazine', 'look', 'so', 'similar', 'one', 'subtle', 'humourous', 'conventions', 'movie', 'satire', 'nobody', 'can', 'keep', 'anybody', 'else', 'identy', 'straight', 'misidentification', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Played', 'wonderfully', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'plan', 'series', 'murders', 'alibi', 'assuming', 'identity', 'one', 'people', 'obvious', 'problem', 'plan', 'people', 'mistake', 'when', 'disguised', 'somebody', 'else', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'missed', 'out', 'humor', 'film', 'so', 'near', 'ridiculous', 'line', 'society', 'toes', 'anyway', 'example', 'almost', 'impossible', 'make', 'satire', 'action', 'movie', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'exagurated', 'begin', 'why', 'American', 'Psycho', 'brilliant', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'part', 'society', 'overlook', 'horrific', 'focus', 'using', 'primarilly', 'ideas', 'society', 'film', 'tremendous', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'important', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'too', 'soon', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'achieve', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'once', 'understand', 'see', 'blood', 'violence', 'totally', 'necessary', 'justified', 'making', 'responsible', 'comment', 'ills', 'society', 'most', 'immediatly', 'need', 'be', 'rectified']",American Psycho VHS
71858,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783243499,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 7]","Relatively speaking, that is.This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas.  Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial.  This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.[And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review]:Yeah, RIGHT.  Who cares.Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering.  Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people.  If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself.  Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught?  Huh?[Resuming control of my review and droning on]:...although the terms ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for ""psychopath"" to be reserved for violent sociopaths.  Another reason ""psychopath"" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...[Again taking over]:Shut up. Who cares who it starred?  The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath.  We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System.  We are NOT intent on self-destruction.  Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it.  Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught.  And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business?  I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""?  Give me a break.Oh.  You think that it hit her while still running, huh?  Ha, ha, ha!  Nice shot, dude.[Again resuming control]:..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending.  We know that he is going to be caught and yet...[Coming back out of the screen...]:We know nothing.  The cops are stupid.  Nobody will believe...[Shoving him back in...]:...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience.  This is the fast lane.  Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life?  Isn't this the essence of escape?  Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended.  And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick.  It's a satire of sorts.  It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman.  The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.  Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, ""Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!""Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath.  I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue.  Clearly Reese's character did not.Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary.  The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person.  The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker.  Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook.  (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it.  I wonder who that was.  Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?)Finally: real life irony.  The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999).

71863,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783243499,D. Litton,"[0, 7]","When I go to the movies, I can handle killings and murders. I can handle people going insane in their own minds, and people surrounding them suffering the consequences. That's not a shot to me; you've seen one death, the rest all seem like eye candy. What I don't like it killings and murders without a sensible plot. There has to be a motive, or a point ultimately made in the ending, that satisfies me well enough to have understood why the killer does what he or she does. Then, it's a good movie.&quot;American Psycho&quot; tried its best to fall into that category, though it succeeded only through its failure. The beginning of the movie was set up quite well, but from then on, all we get is the opinions and actions of a man so obsessed with himself that his motives are so petty and pointless. The movie tries so hard to be a satire of its characters, when in reality, it does nothing but give us a little more bloodshed and massacre than most other movies of this genre.The movie follows the everyday proceedings of a successful businessman by the name of Patrick Bateman, a commodities broker who has an insatiable lust for murder and an extreme amount of disdain for all of those around him. This contempt he holds for everyone in his life, known or unknown, is the cause of his mental snaps, which leads him to commit one heinous act after another. And that's all the movie really is: his descent further and further as he begins killing more people and covering it up like nothing has happened. I can't go into details about the ending, so really, it's your choice as to whether or not it is a redeeming feature for the rest of the movie.The only thing that I found admirable about the film is the fact that it is a no-holds-barred deal, and it seems as though it was made with no regard whatsoever about how the MPAA would deal with its extreme level of sexual and violent content. I admire a movie maker who can look society straight in the eye and basically say, &quot;Hey, this is a movie. Some of it actually does happen in real life. Start realizing it.&quot; This is one of those movies, and for that, I give it credit.However, I was vastly put off by Bateman's overly egotistical attitude towards everything in his life. It begins in a scene when he wakes up in the morning and takes a shower, and a voice over details everything that he does in regard to washing and cleaning his face, how many crunches he can do (&quot;I can go up to 1,000 now.&quot;), and his opinions on life in general. If they had left it at that with this scene, I would've been okay with it, but instead, it extends throughout the entire movie. Even during sex, he cannot help but look at himself in the mirror and flex his bicep. This is the ruinous feature of the film; there's just too much of it for me, and I'm sure others, to handle.While the subject matter of the movie is not the greatest I've ever seen, the actors do a terrific job in their roles.

You know, that book about the murderous yuppie.And if anything, the movie is even more wonderfully brutal than Brett Easton Ellis original book -- a scathing, unnerving movie that swings between savage violence and hilariously sick social satire. But what really makes it work is Christian Bale, who is utterly perfect as the titular American psycho. Every smile, snarl and twitch from this man is utterly perfect.Patrick Bateman (Bale) is the perfect yuppie -- he has a high-paying job and a beautiful fiancee (Reese Witherspoon). He dines at all the best restaurants and goes to the best clubs. He keeps his body, New York apartment and wardrobe in perfect condition, and gives detailed descriptions of his designer clothes, beauty products and music collection.But when his associate Paul (Jared Leto) flaunts a business card that is superior to Bateman's, it sends him into a psychotic rage -- first he kills an old man and his dog, then he cheerily axes Paul to death. A detective named Donald Kimball (Willem Defoe) investigates Paul's disappearance, but doesn't seem to connect Bateman to the man's disappearance despite his many lies.As the days roll by, Bateman's homicidal urges begin to spiral out of control as he kills more and more people, descending deeper and deeper into his own bloody madness. Will he finally be caught for his crimes, and will his insanity finally swallow him up?It sounds like a cliche, but ""American Psycho"" is all about the emptiness of a life without real substance. Every part of Patrick Bateman's life is carefully chosen for the image it gives him. Within that shell of material wealth is a howling void, and the only thing that fills that soul-destroying emptiness is hate, rage and violence.But Mary Harron doesn't preach to you. She starts the story off relatively quietly, following Bateman around his everyday life -- only interrupted by brief explosions of violence (""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood""). But as the movie unfolds, the story becomes more gruesome -- and more surreal. By the finale, the world has been warped into a bloody funhouse mirror where nothing can be trusted.Consider: an ATM demands that Bateman feed it a cat... and he does. He manages to kill a prostitute by FLINGING A CHAINSAW DOWN A STAIRWELL. And he cheerfully dances through his apartment in a tidy raincoat, babbling about music right before he axes his nemesis in the head.Christian Bale is scarily brilliant in this role, in the way that only the best actors can be. Not everybody can play a psychotic this perfectly. Reportedly he based his performance on Tom Cruise, and I can see that -- Bateman greets the world with a friendly voice and a shiny smile. But his eyes are cold and empty, except when the rage and hate begins to well up behind them.And yet... and yet Bale still manages to make you feel vaguely sorry for Bateman every now and then. He's insane, empty and seems to yearn for the human connections he only knows about through songs. He's pitiable, freakish and terrifying.""American Psycho"" is wickedly funny, surreal and gruesome -- and Christian Bale is utterly sublime as a psycho that nobody seems to recognize.

71874,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,0783243499,Elisabeth,"[4, 6]","** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS **In the beginning, I found this movie compelling to watch.  We see Patrick (Christian Bale) as a businessman who's a little too smooth, a little too perfect.  He's got this artificial voice that makes him sound like a DJ for smooth Jazz.  And he's got the exfoliated, overly-cleansed, smooth skin to match.  It was interesting seeing him peel off his beauty mask, like a literal mask of perfection he peels off when he gets home and his dark side emerges.  This movie also pokes fun at the artificialness of yuppies.However, it quickly turns into one of those jokes that was funny the first time, but soon gets old the more you hear it.  This movie suffers from being too repetitive.  Even the murders get repetitive after awhile.  Patrick feels competitive, then angry, then puts on a soundtrack, which he explains in great detail, and then kills...over and over again.I had two other problems with this movie, too.  The first was trying to figure out what motivated Patrick to kill.  Did he kill because he felt superior to others or inferior to others?He talks about how disgusted he is with the people he works with and women in general, which makes me think he kills because he feels superior.  He even kills a homeless man  who  tells Patrick he thinks Patrick is a good man, which tells me he's disgusted by kindness and feels above that emotion.But then he also acts hyper competitive with his boss as well as colleagues, whom he constantly compares who has the better designed business card.  And since he kills soon after these instances, it tells me he actually feels inferior instead.His needing to control women and tell them how to dress and act both spell a feeling of superiority (feeling disgusted by how easily manipulated they are), but also inferior in that he even needs to control them at all (like he's afraid if he didn't control them, they could easily control him instead).The second problem was whether Patrick wanted to be stopped from killing again or memorialized for his killing.Confessing to one man and pleading with his secretary (even sparing her life) tells me he wants to be stopped.  But earlier he had talked about serial killers like Gacy and Bundy as if they were his heroes, so that tells me he wants to be memorialized instead.Because this movie lacks focus, it doesn't know which direction to go in or how to end, so instead, it cops out by saying this was all just a fantasy.  The whole fantasy angle could've still worked had Patrick never been a part of the business world at all (and this is just how he imagined this world would look like), but he is a part of it, which makes it confusing to know what really happened and what didn't.Although I think Christian Bale is a good actor who makes interesting choices, this one didn't work for me.",2,Lacked focus,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,2820,"['**', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', '**In', 'beginning', 'found', 'movie', 'compelling', 'watch', 'see', 'Patrick', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'businessman', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'smooth', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'got', 'artificial', 'voice', 'sound', 'DJ', 'smooth', 'Jazz', 'got', 'exfoliated', 'overly-cleansed', 'smooth', 'skin', 'match', 'was', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'peel', 'off', 'beauty', 'mask', 'literal', 'mask', 'perfection', 'when', 'home', 'dark', 'side', 'movie', 'also', 'fun', 'artificialness', 'yuppies.However', 'quickly', 'one', 'jokes', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'soon', 'old', 'more', 'hear', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'repetitive', 'Even', 'murders', 'get', 'repetitive', 'awhile', 'Patrick', 'feels', 'competitive', 'then', 'angry', 'then', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'detail', 'then', 'kills', 'again.I', 'had', 'two', 'other', 'problems', 'movie', 'too', 'first', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'motivated', 'Patrick', 'kill', 'Did', 'kill', 'felt', 'superior', 'others', 'inferior', 'others', 'how', 'disgusted', 'people', 'women', 'general', 'think', 'superior', 'even', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', 'good', 'man', 'disgusted', 'kindness', 'feels', 'emotion.But', 'then', 'also', 'hyper', 'competitive', 'boss', 'as', 'well', 'colleagues', 'whom', 'constantly', 'who', 'better', 'designed', 'business', 'card', 'soon', 'instances', 'actually', 'inferior', 'instead.His', 'needing', 'control', 'women', 'tell', 'how', 'dress', 'act', 'spell', 'feeling', 'superiority', 'feeling', 'disgusted', 'how', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'are', 'also', 'inferior', 'even', 'control', 'afraid', 'did', ""n't"", 'control', 'could', 'easily', 'control', 'instead', '.The', 'second', 'problem', 'was', 'Patrick', 'wanted', 'be', 'stopped', 'killing', 'again', 'memorialized', 'killing.Confessing', 'one', 'man', 'pleading', 'secretary', 'even', 'sparing', 'life', 'be', 'stopped', 'earlier', 'had', 'talked', 'serial', 'killers', 'Gacy', 'Bundy', 'were', 'heroes', 'be', 'memorialized', 'movie', 'focus', ""n't"", 'know', 'direction', 'go', 'how', 'end', 'instead', 'out', 'saying', 'was', 'just', 'fantasy', 'whole', 'fantasy', 'angle', 'could', ""'ve"", 'still', 'worked', 'had', 'Patrick', 'never', 'been', 'part', 'business', 'world', 'just', 'how', 'imagined', 'world', 'would', 'look', 'part', 'confusing', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'what', 'think', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'interesting', 'choices', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",American Psycho VHS

71876,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,0783243499,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[6, 19]","Mary Harron butchered one of my favorite books in the world. A literary giant. A book that defies so many conventional styles of writing, and set the pace for so many other budding artist to open their minds eye up to paper and spill all. I was horrified beyond explanation, and after initiallly viewing the film, which I waited two years plus to see because of fear of said deplorability, I sent her agent a letter detailing in 'no uncertian terms' how I felt about her talents, or lackthereof.Let me begin, and I am hoping you reader, you avid movie afficioando, will have an open eye to my view and not shoot me down with a check in the unhelpful column.  Remember this is just one movie lovers review, but it is *mine* nonetheless. Just one person's opinion on the transformation or migration, if you will from print to 35, just like one would certainly not go see a film based on what Gene Siskel or Shalit would say, or even A.O.  Scott (Heavens to Betsy), would say. We see the films we love or despise in our own unique ways.So with that said, if you read the book, and instantly, no immediately, no almost compulsively read it in one sitting, and then read it again, and again and again, and shared it with others who gave you strange  looks, or read it on the metro in Montreal or the filthy NR train to do your own bloodstained shirts downtown in NYC, and then realized that you have this work of pure metaphysical art next to your bedstand, and you stick it routinely in a napsack or the like, and for some reason or another you have 'YET' to rent or buy this DVD: ""DONT."" I strongly encourage you, from one Ellis lover to another, hold off. Your Pat Bateman and the like, the characters you know and love and cherish and adore,  the scenes you have built up and played out in your minds eye time and time again, the pages that you have highlighted and doggy eared, the paragraphs which you have transformed over to myspace in perhaps your 'About Me' section, and the underlining on endless tabs of dazzling, dancing prose, that make Psycho what it was, will be sledgehammered, and you will wonder why it happened, who let it happen, and perhaps, like I was, be angry you saw it.Now I don't know what Ellis thought about Ms. Haron's version of this or even worse transforming of prose to film, the focal point of this reviewer, however the blame should lie ENTIRELY with her, not only from a directors standpoint, but from the dual roll as well as writer. Just like the most important part of reading a book in English from another language is obviously the translation, (Hamsun's 'Hunger' comes to mind, the others don't touch his translation) such should be that of the dual role of Ms.Harron.Now everyone has their own interpretation of Ellis' masterpiece, some take the novel very seriously, and compare it to some of the finest novels of our time, others, like Norman Mailer for instance, compare his writing style to that of Dostoyevski, and the reader can think it's a farce from the getgo with the satirical portrayal of Manhattan in the 80's and the stink, stank, stunk of the city that everyone knows 'how filthy it really is'. Yes, often times you wonder if in fact this murdering lifestyle Ellis' main character Pat Bateman delves into, is simply a figment of a warped mind, a sociopathic troubled yuppy, who would like to at times lash out at the world, and slice the throats of not only pathetic street urchins and flaming homosexuals, but also friends, coworkers and family alike.However, I took the book a bit more seriously. Ellis' amazing eye to detail in the murder scenes, and the exceptional tools he uses to craft out his work, is sheer brilliance. Ellis practically hands down nails 80's socialities in Manhattan. He nails their bravado, their ostentatiousness, their melancholy, ignorance of the downtrodden 'others' and his overt drug usage in the novel, placated with his having to look immacaulate with people that he surrounds himself with, who in turn have to look immaculate, is DEAD ON, and they did try hard to make that portrial come through in the film. The pretentiousness and thinking they have a better pot to piss in exist even moreso today (look at the pathetic Lindsey Lohan's, Paris Hilton's and Nicole Richie's of the world).The movie was portrayed too much as a farce. The dining scenes and dialouge are so brilliantly executed in the novel and sadly Ms. Harris misses almost every fine turn and trick in those conversations, including, but certainly not limited to the multiple 'Bellini' Orders that keep coming to the table, the red snapper scene which carries over to multiple chapters, trying to secure tables at A List restaurants last minute, Bateman's inner turmoil. I mean you kind of see it, (the business card scene comes to mind, which was not done that badly, for in that scene in itself we so how something as truly insignificant as raised brail on a card, can be so utterly important and top priority in these mens lives), yet it's not tangible to this viewer. I want to see Bateman cringing and screaming inside, and rarely do we see that in the film. The secretaries roll of Jean (played lacklustery by Chlo Sevigny), was third rate Ishtarian. Jean is a very important role, and at times I find, at least in the book, that Pat's feelings for Jean he stating he may eventually marry her, are quite genuine.There is one scene in the book where Bateman and I think that goof Van Patten and Craig McDermott, who is tres hip, are in the Yale Club and the flamboyant Carruthers is sitting a few tables away, and he (Bateman) is talking about what it would be like if Luis was eradicated. Would Courtney like him less if Luis was gone, what would it be like, and in his charade about killing Luis he talk about the war in Namibia with the Soviets, and through all this he ends with thinking about hacking Luis to death. There is nothing really humorous about that, disturbing and certainly sadistic, and that is exactly what Bateman is thinking. In the Yale Club at that exact moment he would love to just cold out murder Luis and watch his blood drain from his body, that in all surreal innuendo, is freakin brilliant.To think how many of us, (it's ok I will say it), want to just dump a body in a river sometimes, because of some of the assanine, trite people we share the earth with. It's human emotion, hate is an emotion.Those types of emotions garnered by Ellis and this reader did not come through in the film. It was rushed, lacked depth and character development. The exchanges between the detective, played suprisingly unbrilliantly by William Dafoe were adolescent; and the social scenes, although they were immaculately dead on with the clothes and the spit-spot looks and demeanors of the characters, the cohesion was flat and uninspiring.Then they went and defiled Ellis again by making American Psycho 2.In contrast, and to close, Christian Bale is a brilliant actor, his role as young Jim in Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" is one of the most brilliant performances in cinema, and he did a fine job playing often emotionless and dead on 'mentally deranged' Pat Bateman. If they had a different director let's, say ""Brian De Palma,"" and a brilliant screenwriter (Ted Tally comes to mind), with a more interesting ensemble cast, this could have been a masterpiece.",1,the complete ruin of one of the greatest novels in literature,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,7342,"['Mary', 'Harron', 'butchered', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'world', 'literary',

71877,A3UISFQMOSZJMO,0783243499,Elizebeth Neumann,"[3, 5]","Now I have to say that when I first saw this movie (on opening day) I saw it for two reasons. One was I love Chritian Bale. And the other was for Brett Easton Ellis. Although at the time I hadnt read this book, I had only read ""Less than Zero"" and that was close to ten years earlier.First I will review the movie to people who have not read the book and then I will review it to those who have.This is basically a movie about a serial killer. Although this is a bit different. The killer happens to be a rich, young, good looking wallstreet executive. This is also a black comedy, with some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear. It is also a period movie with meticulous details to the mid to late 1980's.When I left the movie I was confused. Did he kill all those people? Was it only his imagination? Was it a comment on how we all have homicidal thoughts or immoral thoughts but we dont act on them? What was going on????? Well when I had only seen the movie my assumption was that he did not kill anyone. It was all a sick fantasy and he was just crazy, but not a killer. After reading the book I have completely changed my mind. Because there are too many things left out of the movie that if they were in it I would have though otherwise.Now there are some moments in the book which I feel are key to the story that never made it in the movie. One of them was his meeting with his ex-girlfriend. This is one of the few times we see Patrick as close to human. He is nervous, sweaty and intimidated by this woman. Which also has the best ""twist"" of the book with her new boyfriend being the head chef at ""Dorsia"", that illusive and chic resteraunt he can never get a reservation for.There are moments in the movie where the dialogue is dead on and ripped straight from the book, which I love. But most of the other times the dialogue is borrowed from one charachter and given to another. The scenes are blended into eachother for whatever reason and so much is left out. The movie is by far less graphic. And it also moves too quickly. I believe the book takes place over an almost two year period where the movie is in about a 6 month stretch of time.Also in the book I dont think anything bad happens for nearly 100 pages or so. But in the movie in the first 5 minutes he makes a comment to a waitress about killing her. That buildup in the book was really important. You knew he would snap, but it was taking a long time to build everything.Also there is the detective that I have a problem with. In the book he is young, attractive and dresses as well as Patrick. In the movie he is played by a much older and less attractive Willem Defoe.Also the realtionship with his secretary is totally stripped down to bare bones and doesnt get anywhere near what it is in the book. I really disliked that.If your a fan of the book Im sure youve seen it. If you havent it's worth it to watch anyway even with all it's faults. It's a hard book and Im not sure if it could be made into a movie well. Although Id like to see someone try again.If you havent read the book then you should still see the movie. If you like Christian Bale you will see him in a whole new light. He also pulled off a role that Im not sure anyone else could.I gave it a 3 star rating because of the issues I have with book/versus movie. But its still entertaining and a good converstation will happen after you watch it with someone.",3,"Christian Bale deserves 10 stars, but the movie has problems",1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,3406,"['Now', 'have', 'say', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'opening', 'day', 'saw', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'was', 'love', 'Chritian', 'Bale', 'other', 'was', 'Brett', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'time', 'hadnt', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'only', 'read', 'Less', 'Zero', 'was', 'close', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier.First', 'will', 'review', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'review', 'who', 'have.This', 'basically', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'bit', 'different', 'killer', 'be', 'rich', 'young', 'good', 'looking', 'wallstreet', 'executive', 'also', 'black', 'comedy', 'funniest', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'also', 'period', 'movie', 'meticulous', 'details', 'mid', 'late', ""1980's.When"", 'left', 'movie', 'was', 'confused', 'Did', 'kill', 'people', 'Was', 'only', 'imagination', 'Was', 'comment', 'how', 'have', 'homicidal', 'thoughts', 'immoral', 'thoughts', 'dont', 'act', 'What', 'was', 'going', 'Well', 'when', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'assumption', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'anyone', 'was', 'sick', 'fantasy', 'was', 'just', 'crazy', 'not', 'killer', 'reading', 'book', 'have', 'completely', 'changed', 'mind', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'left', 'movie', 'were', 'would', 'have', 'though', 'are', 'moments', 'book', 'feel', 'are', 'key', 'story', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'One', 'was', 'meeting', 'ex-girlfriend', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'see', 'Patrick', 'close', 'human', 'nervous', 'sweaty', 'intimidated', 'woman', 'Which', 'also', 'best', 'twist', 'book', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'being', 'head', 'chef', 'Dorsia', 'illusive', 'chic', 'resteraunt', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'reservation', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'dialogue', 'dead', 'ripped', 'straight', 'book', 'love', 'most', 'other', 'times', 'dialogue', 'borrowed', 'one', 'charachter', 'given', 'scenes', 'are', 'blended', 'eachother', 'reason', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'graphic', 'also', 'too', 'quickly', 'believe', 'book', 'place', 'almost', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'where', 'movie', '6', 'month', 'stretch', 'time.Also', 'book', 'dont', 'think', 'anything', 'bad', 'nearly', '100', 'pages', 'so', 'movie', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'comment', 'waitress', 'killing', 'buildup', 'book', 'was', 'really', 'important', 'knew', 'would', 'snap', 'was', 'taking', 'long', 'time', 'build', 'everything.Also', 'detective', 'have', 'problem', 'book', 'young', 'attractive', 'as', 'well', 'Patrick', 'movie', 'played', 'much', 'older', 'less', 'attractive', 'Willem', 'Defoe.Also', 'realtionship', 'secretary', 'totally', 'stripped', 'down', 'bare', 'bones', 'doesnt', 'get', 'anywhere', 'what', 'book', 'really', 'disliked', 'that.If', 'fan', 'book', 'Im', 'sure', 'youve', 'seen', 'havent', 'worth', 'watch', 'anyway', 'even', 'faults', 'hard', 'book', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'well', 'Id', 'see', 'someone', 'try', 'havent', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'should', 'still', 'see', 'movie', 'like', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'will', 'see', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'also', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'else', 'gave', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'issues', 'have', 'book/versus', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'good', 'converstation', 'will', 'happen', 'watch', 'someone']",American Psycho VHS

A lot of people saw the title and must of thought about 'oh just another kill movie.' No. American Psycho is not a killing spree movie. It is a well plotted film, and since being a huge fan of the book, I thought this movie hit the book like a hammer on a nail. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is smart, intelligent, rich, and lives the life that most people can only dream of. He is everything I thought of Patrick Bateman in the book. A couple of things that they missed was Patrick Bateman's excessive details; The Patty Winters Show, and what he wears and what his friends wear. I guess that the screeplay writers didnt want to bore the audidence with his excessive detail about everything he see's as in the book. The story takes place in NYC in the 80's with him going to fancy dinners, and work. Although we dont know what he does since Bret Easton Ellis didnt want to tell us what Patrick Bateman did for a living. So there are times where he does talk to his fiancee Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon, which I think she tried a little to hard during the upsetting parts in the film), and he is always mistakn for someone who works wirh him since they all look alike; slick back hair, designer clothes, nice bodies, and good looks. Some of the disturbing parts is when he does kill, but I felt that the movie was not too violent enough like the book. The book was full of gore and I didnt mind seeing it in the movie, and the sex scenes were not up to par with the scenes in the book, but if it was then, American Psycho would of have been rated XXX because the scenes in the book describe sex like it is shown in XXX rated films. In all, the movie was beautifully described and tell told. Now in the end, it is where you have to think, bur I am not going to spoil the ending because it is very strange but yet very entertaining.",5,A very good adapition of the book,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1898,"['American', 'Psycho', 'murder', 'clubs', 'sex', 'drugs', '80', 'right', 'Wrong', 'lot', 'people', 'saw', 'title', 'must', 'thought', ""'oh"", 'just', 'kill', 'movie', 'American', 'Psycho', 'not', 'killing', 'spree', 'movie', 'well', 'plotted', 'film', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'thought', 'movie', 'hit', 'book', 'hammer', 'nail', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'rich', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'everything', 'thought', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'book', 'couple', 'things', 'missed', 'was', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'excessive', 'details', 'Patty', 'Winters', 'Show', 'what', 'what', 'friends', 'wear', 'guess', 'screeplay', 'writers', 'didnt', 'want', 'bore', 'audidence', 'excessive', 'detail', 'everything', 'see', 'book', 'story', 'place', 'NYC', '80', 'going', 'fancy', 'dinners', 'work', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'didnt', 'want', 'tell', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'did', 'living', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'talk', 'fiancee', 'Evelyn', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'think', 'tried', 'little', 'hard', 'upsetting', 'parts', 'film', 'always', 'mistakn', 'someone', 'who', 'wirh', 'look', 'alike', 'slick', 'back', 'hair', 'designer', 'clothes', 'nice', 'bodies', 'good', 'looks', 'disturbing', 'parts', 'when', 'kill', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'enough', 'book', 'book', 'was', 'full', 'gore', 'didnt', 'seeing', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'scenes', 'book', 'was', 'then', 'American', 'Psycho', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'XXX', 'scenes', 'book', 'sex', 'shown', 'XXX', 'rated', 'films', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'described', 'tell', 'told', 'Now', 'end', 'where', 'have', 'think', 'bur', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'ending', 'very', 'strange', 'yet', 'very', 'entertaining']",American Psycho VHS
71881,A3FUUA7PQQAA9W,0783243499,Eric McDowell,"[1, 4]","Watching American Psycho was one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences I've ever been through (the 1997 German-made film Funny Games (subtitled) being the most tramatic for me). A satire of the materialism and the &quot;me-ism&quot; of the 80's? OK. A dark comedy?? I hardly think so, at least not in the way dark comedy is supposed to work. The movie tries to be too many things to the point that ultimately, it failed for me. It tries satire, horror, psychological &quot;probing&quot; for answers, (although this is understated) unanswered questions, surprise; in short, everything seems thrown into the mix. And even with all of the film's ability to transfix viewers by the sheer audacity of the plot and its execution (seriously, no pun intended), however horrific, I just felt sick to my stomach and VERY depressed when it ended. NOTHING is funny about torture and murder, whatever the context, unless it's explicitly clear FROM THE START AND WITHOUT A DOUBT that dark comedy is the goal (i.e. the late Paul Bartel's 1982 flick Eating Raoul comes to mind).As a male I found the film repugnant and offensive, especially by the cavalier way that sex, brutality, and murder are depicted. Without ignoring the fact that Bale's character is quite sick, whether the acts were actually committed or just in his diseased mind, the film disturbes on a more basic level because it reinforces the notion that men get pleasure from violent sex, from wielding power over women, and just that men can't be trusted, period. Not one male character in the film is depicted in a positive way. Women have plenty enough images of these sick, sadistic men; women are already terrified enough of these men and of the horrifying chances of encountering them. At times I felt the film bordered on an indictment of all male behavior when it comes to sex and power over others. OK, maybe I'm overstating my case here, but that's just how unpleasant the film came off to me (obviously, not that it was supposed to be pleasant), and as such, I just can't buy the notion of dark comedy.

71882,A84UFSF2SZS2W,0783243499,"EriKa ""E""","[2, 5]","Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman is vile and disgusting... just like he is supposed to be. In a tale based on a best-selling novel, this disturbing film showcases the excesses and disposability of American life in the 1980s. Bateman is a successful and financially well off New York corporate suit and tie who hangs around with other shallow and plastic carbon copies of himself. They compare business cards and become excited by the lettering and exact colours of the cards. It is quite stunning in its brutal shallowness. But when it comes to brutal, there is nothing quite so brutal as Bateman's disposable attitude toward people. About one quarter of the way into the movie, you realise that Bateman, while plastic and passionless in most ways, cannot get his aggressions and feelings out through any means of expression but violent and heinous murder. He murders prostitutes, strangers, co workers. You name it. The graphic depictions of these murders are unbelievable and caused controversy when the film was released. Strangely enough, though, all the violence and blood and gore makes it onto the screen but a sex scene between Bateman and two prostitutes was censored. The funny thing about this film is that while there are a few notable actors in it (Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's fianc&eacute;e, Jared Leto as Bateman's office nemesis Paul Allen, and Samantha Mathis as Bateman's sometime sex partner) none of them is more than one dimensional, except maybe the secretary simply because she is not caught up in the plastic world which all these others occupy.  I suppose this is the point and all the actors have done their jobs well as a result. Is this a good movie worth your time? Not so sure. I went to see it at the cinema when it was first released, and I had to get up and leave halfway through because there were people all around me eating and making too much noise. The movie was good enough to sit through, but it was not gripping enough for me to regret getting up and leaving in the middle.",3,EXCESS,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,2056,"['Christian', 'Bale', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'vile', 'disgusting', 'just', 'supposed', 'be', 'tale', 'based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'disturbing', 'film', 'excesses', 'disposability', 'American', 'life', '1980s', 'Bateman', 'successful', 'financially', 'well', 'New', 'York', 'corporate', 'suit', 'tie', 'who', 'other', 'shallow', 'plastic', 'carbon', 'copies', 'compare', 'business', 'cards', 'become', 'excited', 'lettering', 'exact', 'colours', 'cards', 'quite', 'stunning', 'brutal', 'shallowness', 'when', 'brutal', 'nothing', 'quite', 'so', 'brutal', 'Bateman', 'disposable', 'attitude', 'people', 'one', 'quarter', 'way', 'movie', 'realise', 'Bateman', 'plastic', 'passionless', 'most', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'aggressions', 'feelings', 'out', 'means', 'expression', 'violent', 'heinous', 'murder', 'prostitutes', 'strangers', 'co', 'workers', 'name', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'murders', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'caused', 'controversy', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'though', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'screen', 'sex', 'scene', 'Bateman', 'two', 'prostitutes', 'was', 'censored', 'funny', 'thing', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'notable', 'actors', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Bateman', 'secretary', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Bateman', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Bateman', 'office', 'nemesis', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Bateman', 'sometime', 'sex', 'partner', 'none', 'more', 'one', 'dimensional', 'maybe', 'secretary', 'simply', 'not', 'caught', 'up', 'plastic', 'world', 'others', 'occupy', 'suppose', 'point', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'jobs', 'well', 'result', 'good', 'movie', 'time', 'Not', 'so', 'sure', 'went', 'see', 'cinema', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'had', 'get', 'up', 'leave', 'halfway', 'were', 'people', 'eating', 'making', 'too', 'much', 'noise', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'sit', 'was', 'not', 'gripping', 'enough', 'regret', 'getting', 'up', 'leaving', 'middle']",American Psycho VHS
71883,AYKELBZM1SH87,0783243499,Erin O'Brien,"[2, 2]","If Mary Harron's film has the slightest chance of being regarded as a success, it will only be seen as such by viewers unfamiliar with Bret Easton Ellis's novel.The Ellis novel was relentlessly downbeat, its occasional black humour registering entirely intellectually. Flashes of brutal wit jolt the reader from the otherwise deliberate numbing produced by his obsessive-compulsive villain's soliloquays. Ellis's world is claustrophobic, oppressive: one in which every character is a monster of greed and moral apathy. Patrick Bateman is distinguished from his peers only by his commission of sickeningly and inventively brutal murders.For all the disco-ball glamour of Bateman's world, the utter crassness of his monied yuppie compatriots undercuts any sense of a reader's vicarious envy. In any one of Ellis's setpiece exclusive restaurants, the maitre-d' is shockingly rude in the ugly American sense (as oppposed to a stereotypically highbrow French or English sense), the waitresses are surly and incompetent, and the nearby diners speak far too loudly about nothing but money and shopping. The most expensive evening in Manhattan turns out to be a very unpleasant experience indeed.Harron very wrongly plays &quot;American Psycho&quot; for its 'comedy'. The atmosphere of its opening scene is reminiscent of an opera bouffe, as the credits are spelled in what first appears to be blood and is soon shown to be a berry sauce drizzled over elaborately presented food at--a cinematic and novelistic leitmotif---an exclusive restaurant.The film is surprisingly non-violent on an explicit level, almost as much so as the novel was graphic. Harron perhaps dodged some ratings issues, in addition to a great deal of political flack, with her use of implied and off-screen violence, and much less of it at that than occurs in the Ellis story. However necessary such a choice may have been from the point of view of marketing, however, Harron loses a critical dimension of grittiness and actual (not only spiritual) horror. Bateman's madness and detached curiosity (according to Ellis) are explicated in the novel through the agency of his treatment of corpses, his forays into dissection and cannibalism.Harron similarly airbrushes the grinding poverty, filthiness, and random, miscellaneous unpleasantnesses from Manhattan's streets. Tellingly, Ellis's novel begins with Bateman's judgemental observation of street people, depraved graffiti and garbage, as seen from a taxi window. Harron's film shows none of that, except in the brief meeting between Bateman and a beggar, a scene very much toned down from the novel.One can only imagine how disasterous the once-rumoured casting of Leonardo diCaprio as Bateman might have been. DiCaprio's slender, unthreatening frame and distinctive facial beauty would have made it impossible either to fear him or to mistake him for others, as constantly happens in the plot of both the novel and the film.Patrick Bateman, in Ellis's protrayal, is so flawlessly groomed and generically, nearly featurelessly handsome that he is occassionally taken for any vapidly perfect male model.Harron chose Christian Bale well as a physical presence. He wears his designer suits with the oblivious comfort of the well-born, and his nearly perfect face is oddly forgettable. There is something enigmatic and seemingly incomplete about Bale's physiognomy: even watching direct shots of him taken at close-range, one has the sense of seeing something obliquely, as if part of his face were constantly obscured, or faceted ever so slightly out of the line of vision. Bale's lovely face is indeed one which, as the plot and characterization require, could be mistaken for that of any other equally handsome man.The choice of a British actor for Bateman, however talented he may be, no doubt appeared to be a good idea in the initial casting process. Few American actors would appreciate the hyper-sensitivity to class issues which Ellis's Bateman ruminates on, endlessly and disdainfully, nor could they easily generate his droit de seigneur bearing.There is, however, the very unfortunate matter of Bale's attempted American accent. Bale clearly spent mucht time studying the particular nasal bray of the Andover-Harvard aristocracy, but he never once pulls it off, sounding instead as if he had a slight speech impediment. Given that Bale is the lead, this constant distraction is most unfortunate for the film overall.By soft-shoeing the hideousness of Bateman's acts; by relatively normalizing the members of his social circle; and by completely removing the other, darker, despairing New York from Bateman's designer world, Harron does much to reduce her lead to a bizarre but meaninglessly destructive cipher.Unfortunately, Ellis's extraordinary sensitivity to sociological phenomena is rarely in evidence here. The more conflicted, intelligent, 'deeper' Bateman which Ellis so carefully constructs as a sort of human 'cautionary tale' ends up as something like the evil twin of Christian Bale's smirking, guffawing incarnation.",3,A failed adaptation of an inherently unfilmable novel,972086400,"10 21, 2000",2000,5055,"['Mary', 'Harron', 'film', 'slightest', 'chance', 'being', 'regarded', 'success',

71884,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,0783243499,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[4, 5]","Mary Harron's American Psycho (based on the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel) is really quite a brilliant movie. I recall seeing it five years ago when it first came out, but never really appreciated it much until I saw it again recently. I remember liking it when I first saw it, but found it rather disturbing. Watching it again, I realized what a brilliant comedy it actually is. It's not a thriller at all, it's completely a dark comedy. A very dark comedy. It brilliantly satirizes the ""yuppie"" lifestyle by portraying young businessmen as hollow, soulless robots whose only concerns are: A) having an expensive apartment, B) Having a nice, stylish business card and C) Getting reservations to the nicest, most expensive restaurants in town. Director Harron portrays these people almost as inhuman, and in the case of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), unfeeling and homicidal. Christian Bale gives an amazing performance as Bateman the yuppie psycho. Bale alone makes the film worth watching. His character is cold, arrogant and able to murder an innocent person without batting an eyelash. There's a very memorable scene where Bateman slaughters a coworker with an axe while discussing the music of Huey Lewis and the News. Christian Bale is always believable as the meticulous, obsessive psycho.I feel that as a whole, American Psycho doesn't completely work. Towards the end, it feels a little bit aloof and ends rather abruptly. There's really not much of a conventional story, so that detracts from it a little bit.

71885,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783243499,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 6]","Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits.  ""American Psycho"" is a satirical horror film that had greater potential  than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the  problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of  the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should  have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron  pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie  superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She  then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.The film would have  benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather  than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life.  The story  presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most  horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas  this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a  first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's  head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused  on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about  the people he was killing or the acts themselves.The acting by Bale was  excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the  poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the  caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous, supercilious and decadent  than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional  disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.Overall, the way  the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the  characters and their behavior which took the effectiveness out of the  psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only  mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed  miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult  classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct  possibility.",2,A Directorial Hack Job,968457600,"09 9, 2000",2000,2201,"['Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'take', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'American', 'Psycho', 'satirical', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'greater', 'potential', 'was', 'realized', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'adaptation', 'direction', 'be', 'problem', 'Part', 'story', 'was', 'lampoon', 'excessive', 'materialism', '1980', 'focusing', 'particularly', 'yuppie', 'lifestyle', 'should', 'have', 'served', 'background', 'character', 'study', 'However', 'Harron', 'pushed', 'foreground', 'exaggerated', 'portrayals', 'yuppie', 'superficiality', 'arrogance', 'point', 'where', 'became', 'sophomoric', 'then', 'pounded', 'point', 'was', 'threadbare.The', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'development', 'Bateman', 'tortured', 'inner', 'self', 'rather', 'obsession', 'friends', 'way', 'life', 'story', 'presented', 'opportunity', 'fresh', 'approach', 'horror', 'genre', 'Most', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'presented', 'perspective', 'victims', 'story', 'was', 'killer', 'perspective', 'addition', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'had', 'opportunity', 'look', 'killer', 'head', 'was', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'introspection', 'focused', 'thoughts', 'lifestyle', 'not', 'enough', 'feelings', 'people', 'was', 'killing', 'acts', 'themselves.The', 'acting', 'Bale', 'was', 'excellent', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Harron', 'vision', 'Bateman', 'poster', 'child', 'yuppie', 'conceit', 'tawdriness', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'played', 'caricature', 'hilt', 'was', 'more', 'pompous', 'supercilious', 'decadent', 'typical', 'Roman', 'Emperor', 'scene', 'depicting', 'emotional', 'disintegration', 'was', 'terrifically', 'done', 'very', 'intense.Overall', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'created', 'air', 'incredulity', 'characters', 'behavior', 'took', 'effectiveness', 'psychological', 'angle', 'left', 'mindless', 'horror', 'flick', 'only', 'mediocre', 'effects', 'excellent', 'acting', 'rated', 'film', '4/10', 'directorial', 'hack', 'job', 'marred', 'good', 'story', 'concept', 'failed', 'miserably', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'best', 'hope', 'cult', 'classic', 'rental', 'kitsch', 'enough', 'be', 'distinct', 'possibility']",American Psycho VHS

71887,A2UBS120XE605X,0783243499,Frank Paris,"[4, 6]","I started reading through the reviews of this movie, and over and over, I had to click on ""No,"" this review was not ""helpful"" to me, whether the person gave it one star or five stars. After reading about 20 of them, I was beginning to think that either everyone watching it just isn't getting it or I'm as whacked out as Patrick Bateman. My take on this movie seems to be completely different from everyone else's (although I didn't read all 300 reviews: maybe someone in here has my take on it).First let me state my perspective. Judged by how many times I've watched it (about 10 times), this must be one of my favorite movies. I don't seem to be able to get enough of it, and my interpretation of it has evolved from bemused bafflement to a satisfied feeling that I really get it. Second, I did not read the book, and based on what I've read in these reviews, I'm glad I didn't, because I've been able to contemplate this movie without trying to relate it to the book, to contemplate it as an independent work of art that plays with the viewer's mind and challenges the viewer to figure this Patrick Bateman out. Those people responsible for it may have had some ideas triggered by the book, but this movie can stand on its own considerable merits.Unlike some reviewers, I am not in the least attracted by the character of Patrick Bateman. I find him completely contemptible and repulsive, and to allude to a line from the movie, I have nothing in common with him. Yet he is fascinating to watch and I can't help laughing hysterically at his total emptiness and delusions.Delusions bring up the point I want to make about this movie. At one level it is impossible to tell what is real and what is sheer delusion in Patrick Bateman's mind. What is really happening, and what is being imagined or dreamed by Patrick? Maybe he did kill a few people in this movie. But I can't tell whether he really did killed Paul Allen or whether this was merely one of his delusional fantasies. The movie surely gives enough examples of psychotic delusions on his part. Some of the things he says directly to women obviously were not actually said, because if they were, the women would have called for the bouncer to have him thrown out. As it was, they just ignore him. Some of the murders were utterly preposterous, as when he carefully aims the running chainsaw at the prostitute fleeing down the stairs and he throws it at her, stabbing her in the back when she is four flights of stairs below him. Come on! That never happened, even in the movie! Then the killing spree at the end OBVIOUSLY never happened! When he had the shootout with the cops, he takes a couple shots at them, never missing his human target from 100 yards away (do you know how hard that is?), and suddenly one of his bullets causes all the cop cars aligned against him to explode! Even HE is surprised, suddenly staring at his gun in disbelief that he could have done that with a single shot. This was such a string of carnage that it would have been all over the news and all the talk. Yet no one says a word about it when he meets with his associates the next day.When he revisits the apartment where he had dead bodies hanging in every closet, the place is pristine and is for sale. There's not a word from anyone that an apartment was found full of mutilated bodies. Why? Obviously, because it was all in his imagination! After he breaks down and confesses to his lawyer that he just went on a killing spree, he lawyer laughs because it is so preposterous. Such a thing would have made the headlines, yet the lawyer thinks it's just a sick joke, and he saw Paul Allen in London the day Patrick was supposed to have killed him.Yet there is ambiguity even here. All these Wall Street stockbrokers (every one of them younger than 30 and vice-presidents whose greatest status symbols are the classiness of their business cards and where they can get dinner reservations), all of them look and act alike and they are constantly misidentifying each other. Was it really Paul Allen he killed (if he killed one of his associates at all), was it really Paul Allen the lawyer saw in London? It is impossible to say, which is one of the most amusing ironies of this eternally entertaining movie.",5,"Hilarious masterpiece, but misunderstood",1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,4251,"['started', 'reading', 'reviews', 'movie', 'over', 'had', 'click', 'No', 'review', 'was', 'not', 'helpful', 'person', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'five', 'stars', 'reading', '20', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'everyone', 'watching', 'just', ""n't"", 'getting', ""'m"", 'whacked', 'out', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'take', 'movie', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', '300', 'reviews', 'maybe', 'someone', 'here', 'take', 'let', 'state', 'perspective', 'Judged', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', '10', 'times', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'enough', 'interpretation', 'evolved', 'bemused', 'bafflement', 'satisfied', 'feeling', 'really', 'get', 'Second', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'contemplate', 'movie', 'trying', 'relate', 'book', 'contemplate', 'independent', 'work', 'art', 'viewer', 'mind', 'viewer', 'figure', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'out', 'people', 'responsible', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'ideas', 'triggered', 'book', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'considerable', 'reviewers', 'am', 'not', 'least', 'attracted', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'find', 'completely', 'contemptible', 'repulsive', 'allude', 'line', 'movie', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'total', 'emptiness', 'delusions.Delusions', 'bring', 'up', 'point', 'want', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'level', 'impossible', 'tell', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'sheer', 'delusion', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'mind', 'What', 'really', 'happening', 'what', 'being', 'imagined', 'dreamed', 'Patrick', 'Maybe', 'did', 'kill', 'few', 'people', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'really', 'did', 'killed', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'was', 'merely', 'one', 'delusional', 'fantasies', 'movie', 'surely', 'enough', 'examples', 'psychotic', 'delusions', 'part', 'things', 'directly', 'women', 'obviously', 'were', 'not', 'actually', 'said', 'were', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'bouncer', 'have', 'thrown', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'ignore', 'murders', 'were', 'utterly', 'preposterous', 'when', 'carefully', 'running', 'chainsaw', 'prostitute', 'fleeing', 'down', 'stairs', 'stabbing', 'back', 'when', 'four', 'flights', 'stairs', 'Come', 'never', 'happened', 'even', 'movie', 'Then', 'killing', 'spree', 'end', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'never', 'happened', 'When', 'had', 'shootout', 'cops', 'couple', 'shots', 'never', 'missing', 'human', 'target', '100', 'yards', 'away', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'suddenly', 'one', 'bullets', 'cop', 'cars', 'aligned', 'explode', 'Even', 'HE', 'surprised', 'suddenly', 'staring', 'gun', 'disbelief', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'single', 'shot', 'was', 'such', 'string', 'carnage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'news', 'talk', 'one', 'word', 'when', 'associates', 'next', 'day.When', 'apartment', 'where', 'had', 'dead', 'bodies', 'hanging', 'closet', 'place', 'pristine', 'sale', 'not', 'word', 'anyone', 'apartment', 'was', 'found', 'full', 'mutilated', 'bodies', 'Why', 'Obviously', 'was', 'imagination', 'down', 'lawyer', 'just', 'went', 'killing', 'spree', 'lawyer', 'so', 'preposterous', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'headlines', 'yet', 'lawyer', 'just', 'sick', 'joke', 'saw', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'London', 'day', 'Patrick', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'killed', 'him.Yet', 'ambiguity', 'even', 'here', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stockbrokers', 'one', 'younger', '30', 'vice-presidents', 'greatest', 'status', 'symbols', 'are', 'classiness', 'business', 'cards', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'dinner', 'reservations', 'look', 'act', 'alike', 'are', 'constantly', 'misidentifying', 'other', 'Was', 'really', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'killed', 'killed', 'one', 'associates', 'was', 'really', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'lawyer', 'saw', 'London', 'impossible', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'amusing', 'ironies', 'eternally', 'entertaining', 'movie']",American Psycho VHS

And no, you don't see the ax actually hit the head, but you do see it swing and you see the blood fly and you see the bodies hung up on meat hooks in the closet afterwards.I'm not much into these violent movies myself, but my wife likes somewhat scary ones and rented this thinking it was more of a straight-forward thriller. Some other reviewers interpreted this movie (correctly, I suppose) as being satirical, ironic, or funny, but we sure didn't see it that way. True, the whole thing was filled with an extreme bizarreness, but we did not find ourselves laughing. The only result for me was that &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; never kicked in and I sat there shocked that anyone would make a film so full of so much stupid pointless violence. Actually I wound up reading a magazine throughout much of it. There wasn't any real story here that I could detect. Maybe If I hadn't been reading a magazine I could have figured out what the heck the ending was supposed to mean. Oh well.I find it very disturbing that people would make such a movie as this and rake in their big bucks without ever stopping to think what might happen if some not-so-stable person watched it and decided to imitate it. Mind you, I'm by no means calling for any sort of government censorship here. In fact, I'm the chair of our local Libertarian Party affiliate and I devote considerable energy to fighting such governmental actions. But I also realize that the other side of the freedom coin is personal responsibility, including on the part of movie-makers. As I will continue to argue myself, those watching this type of movie must be held responsible for their own actions. And almost nobody who watches this one movie will get kicked over to the &quot;dark side&quot; and become a serial killer.Almost nobody. But it's a big world, isn't it?Again, I'm 100% against governmental action to restrict what we can see. But this is my private action.

Bateman has another side in his private live though. He is a cold-blooded murderer . He takes his victim's lives with the worst possible way. Analyzing the meaning behind Whitney Houston's music or Huey Lewis &amp; And The News's lyrics is obviously not enough to define himself. Not that he kills people  in order to achieve that .

The murder scenes are absolutely abominable and can almost cause damage to a sensitive person's soul . Haron doesn't hesitate to add black humour touches to a movie as shockingly gory as this one ( Bateman washes...his gloves after that meeting with his collegue in the bathroom ) .

71896,A328S9RN3U5M68,0783243499,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","AMERICAN PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis  novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company.  The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting body Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage).  Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chlo Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the `look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fianc&eacute;e (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her.  Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.AMERICAN PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.

Even if this movie wasn't a spot-on dissection of Reagen-era attitudes and excesses (not that things are that different today), Christian Bale's AMAZING performance would make it worthwhile. I admit I wasn't too into it at first, thinking from reviews and commercials that it would be ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" in Armani...after a few more viewings, it really started to sink in. I now watch it at least twice a month. Seriously.Trying to put this into the genre of horror and compare it to films within those confines misses the point entirely...most of the violence takes place off screen and it's actually incidental to the overall point or ""message"". If I had to put it next to another movie for comparison, my choice would be ""Taxi Driver"". It portrays the same inner turmoil and desire to belong, but in a much more cold and cynical way. Whereas Travis Bickle (DeNiro) had an almost innocent, Holden Caulfield-esque outlook on life and the drive to be a heroic figure that saves the world, Patrick Bateman sees the world as an extension of his ""greed and disgust"".

One of my favorite films of all time, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (see my review if interested) starred a fourteen-year old Christian Bale with a heavy English accent.  What happened!?  He's all grown-up, hunky, and quite the convincing actor (even the accent is gone!).  I thought this movie was good.  As I have stated in another review, this book was banned in places accessible to me during my high school years.  I eventually read the book to discover that it was quite a work of art, often reminiscent of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;.  The movie adaptation is well-done, even though it left out much of the gore of the printed edition.The story takes place amidst the decadence and hairspray atmosphere of the 80's.  Patrick Bateman(Bale) and his friends are obsessed with women, money, great restaurant reservations, and themselves.  Patrick's whole existence is identified to us by his lifestyle.  He is obsessed about everything from his skin care line to his business cards. He is perfect and seemingly normal to his peers.  However, this hunky, wealthy, &quot;perfect&quot; guy has a big secret: When this Wall Street yuppie is not trying to get into &quot;Dorsia&quot;,  NYC's finest restaurant, he's an insane serial killer.  Patrick lives two lives that have only one thing in common...his obsession for cleanliness and perfection. Is he truly insane, or are we all?  It's a rough question to ask yourself while peeking into his behaviors through night and day.The ending leaves us a bit confused. It seemed rushed.  I can't give it away, but it leaves some questions to toss around for hours after finishing the movie.  I thought performances by Reese Witherspoone (&quot;Legally Blonde&quot;) and Chloe Soveigny (&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;) were well done. In all, this is a great film to rent. I won't recommend purchase. I think the extreme gore would probably, in my opinion be a little tiring after a while, but I must say, I couldn't get enough of Patrick Bateman's constant sarcasm.  He has some lines that are so laughable, you sometimes forget this is a Drama/Suspense or Horror in most video stores.  While not a perfect &quot;date movie&quot; (my own sarcastic attempt), &quot;American Psycho&quot; is sure to please if you have a good sense of humor.

Besides that, the movie is great. I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations. Oh, and by the way, I didn't see the unrated version but saw the original theatrical version. After watching the theatrical trailer, I thought that it would be very horrifying and disturbing. But, on the contrary, my friend! The movie is absolutely hilarious! The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified. The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny. Here are some funn moments:1. Patrick Bateman goes to get his sheets washed at a company but gets mad when they say that they can't get out the red stain on them. He claims that it's juice, cran apple. But, of course it isn't.2. Patrick puts newspaper all around a place where a guy's sitting at his house. And then puts on a rain coat. I wonder why.The movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people. From bums to friends that he doesn't like to random women.The movie isn't disturbing because the violence is made in such a comic matter that you laugh out loud, and then maybe feel guilty. But, boy, it's funny. The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending. I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense. And the comic violence made sense to me now. I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning. No one else could have done. Call me crazy, but I would have given him an oscar. He deserved it.And for parents nervous for their children that want to see it, I feel that 13 years + are good ages or mature children. The movie doesn't have a lot of cuss words but has some and the violence isn't really shown. You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in the background but it's made comically. But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes. That's what I did.This is a worthy rent and even a worthy buy.

71905,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0783243499,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[5, 8]","Having read the novel, I knew I had to see the movie ""American Psycho"" starring Christian Bale.  At first, I was reluctant to review this movie knowing that it really is not a horror movie at all, but there are some cinematic elements of horror in this movie, just not in the traditional sense.  ""American Psycho"" really is more of a psychological drama-thriller than a horror movie but, ah, this movie does have a dark side now doesn't it?  That's where my review comes in.First, I would like to point out that the novel has some absolutely brutal and sickening depictions of violence that are clearly not present in the movie.  One has to wonder if the film would have ever been released if such depictions had been put to film.  At any rate, the uncut version does contain more in the way of sexuality, but not much more in the way of violence than the rated version.  There is some blood, but don't expect a lot of gore in this movie, as that is not what this movie is about.  This movie is much deeper than that.""American Psycho"" is really a sharp and very humorous satire of American culture during the 1980s as well as a dark psychological drama and part thriller as well.  There are certainly nihilistic overtones in ""American Psycho"" and Patrick Bateman struggles to stay in touch with reality and to make sense of himself as well as life around him.  There are some existentialistic overtones in this movie as well.  It's really incredible how self-centered all of the characters are in this movie which is also a theme throughout Ellis' novel.  A black comedic element is also only too present in the movie.Having grown up during the 1980s, I literally could not stop laughing during parts of this movie.  You just got to love the materialistic and excess society of America during the 1980s, a time when people could really care less about how much money things cost.  However, people adopted this attitude not only when it came to material possessions and status but other things as well.In ""American Psycho"", Patrick Bateman seems like your normal everyday New York City arrogant little yuppie.  This is the shallow and superficial Patrick Bateman, but on the inside (although Patrick would say this doesn't matter), he is a brutal serial killer.  In social situations, Patrick says all of the right things, he's very politically correct, but is this what Bateman really believes?  Is this what Patrick Bateman is really about?  Certainly not, but he would not dare look out of place or different than the rest of society.  After all, Bateman just wants to fit in, but therein lies the problem.  The theme of the individual versus the machine of society is also developed in the novel and present in the movie.  In Bateman's case, it is the darker side of the human existence that dominates his life.In a sense, the horror in ""American Psycho"" is all about appearances being different than the reality of what is on the inside, the darkness and evil which broods on the inside being obscured by the artificial and seemingly normal outside.  In Patrick Bateman, the Freudian unconscious and base desires come out in a frighteningly brutal fashion, and while certainly a flawed generalization, it's clear from the book and movie that people during 1980s America only saw what was on the outside, and as Patrick concludes, people are either blind or indifferent to that darkness which lives on the inside.Basically, Bateman lives his normal life during the day as he has a great job, a beautiful fiancee and lots of rich friends, yet, he struggles to keep his real self on the inside, but in the darkness of the night, the real Bateman comes out in an absolutely brutal, psychotic, and horrifying fashion.  The movie is able to relate this aspect to some extent, but obviously not like the novel.  However, by movie's end, Bateman becomes even more of a monster than he is in the beginning of the film, and the movie comes to a very dark conclusion that leaves the viewer to wonder about human nature in general.  Bateman's remaining goodness and conscience are completely obliterated by his frustration and disgust with culture and society prevalent during the 1980s.The absurdity of life during the 1980s (at least as Ellis portrays it) is only too obvious as the viewer sees that trivial things become important things and the important things become trivial things with the characters in the movie, and this only underscores the backwardness of American culture during the 1980s.  Hence, Patrick Bateman is a product of such a society, and a confused, disturbed, perverse and inherently dark individual comes to light.  This element of darkness, the unknown, the unconscious mind and psychosis are examined brilliantly inside the mind of Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton's Ellis' novel and to some extent, we get this in the movie as well, mainly because of Bale's brilliant performance.  While the movie doesn't quite capture the depth of the novel, the movie shines at times as well and does a competent job of relating the themes prevalent in Ellis' novel, although not nearly developed to the extent that I would like.Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant as Patrick Bateman, and the rest of the cast is very good as well including Reece Witherspoon.  The direction is good, the script is good although I think the movie could have been longer and more elaborate.  Indeed, I think the problem with the movie is that it is unable to capture the intricacies of the novel, and that's where the movie comes up short, but overall, the movie is pretty good.  Perhaps this is the shortcomings of film in general. At any rate, as a horror movie, ""American Psycho"" is clearly insufficient, but in all fairness, that's not what ""American Psycho"" is all about.  Sure, there's a horrifying element to it all that I find quite interesting, but ""American Psycho"" is also a sharp and very funny satire as well as a dark psychological drama or maybe a thriller but not really a horror movie.  That said, I must confess I found myself laughing more than anything else.Many people view the novel and the movie (although the movie was directed by a woman) as mysogynistic, but this would be a very shallow analysis of a much deeper movie based on an even more intricate novel.  There's no question that the novel is controversial, and the fact that the movie was made by a woman seems ironic and has probably made for an easier transition from print to screen for ""American Psycho"".From a psychological drama's standpoint, ""American Psycho"" is a fine viewing for anyone interested in such an endeavor.  However, I highly recommend reading the book first to experience Ellis' insightful, interesting and highly humorous novel the way it was truly intended as the movie may leave you a bit unsatisfied in the end.",3,"""But inside doesn't matter."" -Patrick Bateman",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,6810,"['Having', 'read', 'novel', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'American', 'Psycho', 'starring',

Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short.

I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of  Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the  satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an  empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.Harron tones  down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the  scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an  edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me  Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of  the film.Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the  movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on  her hands.Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be  did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether  he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic,  Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman  will be a career maker.Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well.  With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual  co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other  actors are window dressing.

There is no suspense, because there is no reason to care what happens.  Christian Bale does a great job, there's just nothing for him to work with here.  The usually likable William Dafoe isn't in the movie enough to develop any sense of who his character is.  The only remotely sympathetic character is the killer's secretary, and she is also a minor character.  All the other characters are completely dislikable.I feel really horrible about throwing away the (money) on  it because I've probably helped encourage Mary Harron to make another movie.  This is really a bad movie with no redeeming qualities what so ever.  The soundtrack consists of a lot of the worst music from the 80's (Huey Lewis and the News for example) combined with orchestral music that sounds like it came from a bad television show.This movie was billed as a satire but there's really nothing funny or amusing about it.  Its mostly just obnoxious, shallow people hanging out together.  The movie is far to angry and empty to ever be witty or amusing even if the writers were capable of wit or intelligence.  It consists of scenes where the yuppies try to get dinner reservations at fancy restraurants, admire each other's business cards, or pontificate on the greatness of Huey Lewis while killing someone.Oh yea, there's also a scene where a dog gets stomped to death.  Gee, that was hysterical.If you want to see a much better movie in the same vein, see Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, or Seven.  These movies are much more intelligent and much better made.

71912,A55RQ26WDPSM0,0783243499,Iusedtobeacat,"[0, 0]","After putting it off for a long time, I finally decided to watch this movie. I haven't read the book, don't really know what the story is all about and if the book is anything like the movie then I gotta tell ya it is a pretty disturbing book. Cuz, this movie was a very disturbing account of a psychotic serial killer's life. It almost felt like reading a journal of a crazy stalker who's completely messed up in the mind except watching it in 3D.Patrick Batmen (Christian Bale) is a wealthy Newyorker who works as a vice president in a big company. He lives in a multi million dollar apartment, he's extremely obsessed with his looks (and given the way Christian Bale looks in this film I really can't blame him), he graduated from Harvard, loves women, sex and music. Basically, he's your typical Rich New York business man who's very arrogant and hard to like, nothing wrong with that, However what most people don't know is that appearances can be deceiving even more than often. The truth is, what most people don't know and what Patrick tries so hard to keep them ignorant and well succeed is that he's completely ""psycho"". I don't mean that as a phrase, no, he is literary ""Psycho"". Patrick not only is extremely paranoid, and on more than one occasion OCD about his looks. He also loves to go around, in the dark, wander the streets and pick up people, take them to his apartment and then torture them before brutally killing them on the spot and deposing of the body. Talking about guilty pleasure huh ? Apparently, Patrick can't help it. He have these unexplained urges to kill and kill and make people feel the pain and it has gotten so out of control to the point that Patrick is scared of it himself.I have to tell you, this movie left me paranoid, thinking of crazy serial killers coming out of no where. Pretty scary and sick too. After watching this, I truly understood why parents always tell their kids not to go out with strangers. I'm no longer a kid but I'll never go out with a stranger ! Even if he was as good looking as Christian Bale. Talking about Christian Bale, his performance was Amazing ! The only reason that made me give this movie a 5 instead of a 4, I mean that's just How impressed I was. He totally deserved at least an Oscar Nomination. I don't know who won the Oscar that year but the Oscar committee is gonna be watching this in a couple of years and they're gonna be really sorry for not giving it to him.I would recommend this movie, ""But"" and a big emphasize on ""BUT"" only if you have an open mind, doesn't freak out on blood and gore (cuz this movie had quite a little and I think some may have issues with that), doesn't mind the drugs and the sex scenes (the drugs weren't as much but the sex scenes..hmm they were revealing even for a Hollywood movie so if you have kids at home don't watch this with your family. I don't know about this cuz I saw the uncut version but the cut version (theoretical release) is still rated a strict (NC-17) which means that you have to be at least 17 to watch this movie.Anyhow, Great acting, Great filmography, Great directing and I liked the dialog this movie is very quotable. The premise is however disturbing with a Capital D if you have anxiety or get nervous you may not be able to sleep so it's better to stay away from this movie. Oh, I don't wanna spoil anything but the ending left me curious but satisfied.",5,Has the fact that your completely Psycho managed to escape your mind ?,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,3400,"['putting', 'off', 'long', 'time', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'story', 'book', 'anything', 'movie', 'then', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'ya', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'book', 'Cuz', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'account', 'psychotic', 'serial', 'killer', 'life', 'almost', 'felt', 'reading', 'journal', 'crazy', 'stalker', 'who', 'completely', 'messed', 'up', 'mind', 'watching', '3D.Patrick', 'Batmen', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'wealthy', 'Newyorker', 'who', 'vice', 'president', 'big', 'company', 'multi', 'million', 'dollar', 'apartment', 'extremely', 'obsessed', 'looks', 'given', 'way', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'graduated', 'Harvard', 'women', 'sex', 'music', 'Basically', 'typical', 'Rich', 'New', 'York', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'arrogant', 'hard', 'like', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'However', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'even', 'more', 'often', 'truth', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Patrick', 'so', 'hard', 'keep', 'ignorant', 'well', 'succeed', 'completely', 'psycho', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'phrase', 'literary', 'Psycho', 'Patrick', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'paranoid', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'looks', 'also', 'go', 'around', 'dark', 'wander', 'streets', 'pick', 'up', 'people', 'take', 'apartment', 'then', 'torture', 'brutally', 'killing', 'spot', 'deposing', 'body', 'Talking', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'huh', 'Apparently', 'Patrick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'unexplained', 'urges', 'kill', 'kill', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'pain', 'gotten', 'so', 'control', 'point', 'Patrick', 'scared', 'have', 'tell', 'movie', 'left', 'paranoid', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'serial', 'killers', 'coming', 'where', 'Pretty', 'scary', 'sick', 'too', 'watching', 'truly', 'understood', 'why', 'parents', 'always', 'tell', 'kids', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'strangers', ""'m"", 'no', 'longer', 'kid', ""'ll"", 'never', 'go', 'out', 'stranger', 'Even', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'looking', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Talking', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'was', 'Amazing', 'only', 'reason', 'made', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'instead', '4', 'mean', 'just', 'How', 'impressed', 'was', 'totally', 'deserved', 'least', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Oscar', 'committee', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'watching', 'couple', 'years', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'really', 'sorry', 'not', 'giving', 'him.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'big', 'emphasize', 'BUT', 'only', 'have', 'open', 'mind', ""n't"", 'freak', 'out', 'blood', 'gore', 'cuz', 'movie', 'had', 'quite', 'little', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'issues', ""n't"", 'mind', 'drugs', 'sex', 'scenes', 'drugs', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'sex', 'scenes..hmm', 'were', 'revealing', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'so', 'have', 'kids', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cuz', 'saw', 'uncut', 'version', 'cut', 'version', 'theoretical', 'release', 'still', 'rated', 'strict', 'NC-17', 'have', 'be', 'least', '17', 'watch', 'movie.Anyhow', 'Great', 'acting', 'Great', 'filmography', 'Great', 'directing', 'liked', 'dialog', 'movie', 'very', 'quotable', 'premise', 'however', 'disturbing', 'Capital', 'D', 'have', 'anxiety', 'get', 'nervous', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'sleep', 'better', 'stay', 'away', 'movie', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'anything', 'ending', 'left', 'curious', 'satisfied']",American Psycho VHS
71913,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783243499,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","With its extra five minutes, the film gets a completely different meaning. From a simple vision of the yuppy who is psychotic and kills to get his kicks in the financial world and goes through with it because he is a yuppy, it becomes the description of his psychosis and we do not know at the end if he has really killed or only imagined the killings. We are a lot more led into thinking that it is all a bad dream, a nightmare, a psychotic hallucination. It thus becomes the third panel of a tryptic. The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding. The American Nightmare then, which shows how those who do not succeed in making that first trip into wealth, fame and power, are led into killing, crime, at times sordid crime. These are the losers and they can only survive in this wolfish society as wolves and criminals. Capitalism leads to crime, either petty crime for the poor losers or organized crime for the more ambitious. The American psychosis is the third element, with crime developing in the mind of a successful subject in order to fuel his success. It is the story of the Golden Boys, of the Yuppies who have to be so ruthless with others in order to dominate and have the upper hand in the financial field that they develop, inside themselves, a completely murderous psychology. The only missing element is the urban paranoia that Stephen King explores in, his books, i.e. the fear of standard average Americans that their neighbors be enemies of the system, hence of them, and try to take over the system and make them slaves to their outlandish, extraterrestrial, revolutionary, dictatorial, funtamentalistic, dogmatic or sectarian objectives aiming at seizing power and then retaining it.This American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America. It is very well connected with the period (the 80s) and President Ronald Reagan, with his speech on the Irangate were he explains that this crime of money, warfare, power and politics is a good thing after all because it reassesses and reasserts the power of America within and without the US. Crime leads to power, and power requires crime, even if it does not justify it, and even if it does not have to be justified, except with the positive result of making America stronger in the world.A great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Dream, Nightmare, Psycho, next stop Hell.",997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,2598,"['extra', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'meaning', 'simple', 'vision', 'yuppy', 'who', 'psychotic', 'kills', 'get', 'kicks', 'financial', 'world', 'yuppy', 'description', 'psychosis', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'really', 'killed', 'only', 'imagined', 'killings', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'led', 'thinking', 'bad', 'dream', 'nightmare', 'psychotic', 'hallucination', 'thus', 'third', 'panel', 'tryptic', 'American', 'Dream', 'first', 'do', 'dream', 'people', 'arriving', 'US', 'succeeding', 'making', 'fortunes', 'least', 'enough', 'money', 'become', 'middle', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'opera', 'American', 'success', 'capitalism', 'positive', 'understanding', 'American', 'Nightmare', 'then', 'how', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'making', 'first', 'trip', 'wealth', 'fame', 'power', 'are', 'led', 'killing', 'crime', 'times', 'sordid', 'crime', 'are', 'losers', 'can', 'only', 'survive', 'wolfish', 'society', 'wolves', 'criminals', 'Capitalism', 'crime', 'petty', 'crime', 'poor', 'losers', 'organized', 'crime', 'more', 'ambitious', 'American', 'psychosis', 'third', 'element', 'crime', 'developing', 'mind', 'successful', 'subject', 'order', 'fuel', 'success', 'story', 'Golden', 'Boys', 'Yuppies', 'who', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'ruthless', 'others', 'order', 'dominate', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'financial', 'field', 'develop', 'inside', 'completely', 'murderous', 'psychology', 'only', 'missing', 'element', 'urban', 'paranoia', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'i.e', 'fear', 'standard', 'average', 'Americans', 'neighbors', 'be', 'enemies', 'system', 'hence', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'system', 'make', 'slaves', 'outlandish', 'extraterrestrial', 'revolutionary', 'dictatorial', 'funtamentalistic', 'dogmatic', 'sectarian', 'objectives', 'aiming', 'seizing', 'power', 'then', 'retaining', 'it.This', 'American', 'Psycho', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'understand', 'modern', 'America', 'very', 'well', 'connected', 'period', '80s', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'speech', 'Irangate', 'were', 'crime', 'money', 'warfare', 'power', 'politics', 'good', 'thing', 'power', 'America', 'US', 'Crime', 'power', 'power', 'crime', 'even', 'not', 'justify', 'even', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'justified', 'positive', 'result', 'making', 'America', 'stronger', 'world.A', 'great', 'film', 'advanced', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'go', 'surface', 'things.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",American Psycho VHS
71914,AQIRPO9O8I8P0,0783243499,James Baker,"[2, 2]","American Psycho, in its literary form, is a difficult read, as it comes off as pure graphic exploitation.  The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny.  Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely.  The film plays as a black comedy, not horror. There is a little bloodshed for the Fangoria hounds here, but most of the violence is off screen, left to the dark pits of imagination.  Christian Bale gives a career making performance, making Patrick Bateman a ridiculous blend of Casey Casem and any masked axe wielding killer you could think of.  But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman.  Don't be afraid!

Yes, you have to have a DARK sense of humor to enjoy it.  This isn't for those who love PATCH ADAMS or the mindless antics of Adam Sandler. The movie is called AMERICAN PSYCHO for a reason.Christian Bale's Bateman is the most vain man alive and his voiceovers describing how he feels about the people around him and what they wear, and his everyday reflections are hysterical. Especially brilliant is his voiceover about his morning ritual. I'm sorry if you don't agree, but I feel that there has never before been a more insightful look at the mindset of a character.Yes, much of what happens seems over the top, but remember, it is the height of the Me Me Me '80s.  And as for the violence seeming over the top, it is nothing compared to the book (also, the key word here is seeming).Watch this film with an open mind. Remember, it is a black comedy.

71919,A2OU415LB9I5J6,0783243499,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 4]","""There are better ways of taking care of Bret Easton Ellis than just censoring him. I would much prefer to see him skinned alive, a rat put up his rectum, and his genitals cut off and fried in a frying pan, in front of - not only a live audience - but a video camera as well. These videos can be sold as ""art"" and ""free expression"" and could be available at every video outlet, library, liquor, and convenience store in the world. We can profit off of Ellis' terror and pain, just as he and bookstores are profiting off of the rape, torture, and mutilation of women.""This is a comment from feminist activist Tara Baxter concerning Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel American Psycho. Due to its graphic violent content and (mis)perceived misogyny, Ellis' novel has seen its fair share of controversy, including Baxter seeking out copies in book stores to dump blood on them. Naturally, in spite of or because of the controversy the book became a bestseller, which in Hollywood means that it must be acquired to become the next big movie!Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an average investment banking executive on Wall Street. So average in fact that he's often confused for other executives within the same firm. Underneath the faade lies the heart of a psychopathic killer that he keeps hidden from the rest of the world. As his hatred for the world intensifies, though, his murderous tendencies become more and more apparent.Satire is something that can be hard to pull off. It must remain subtle while at the same time being clear to viewers that you have a purpose and a message; your subtext should be near the surface but never overt. A lot of times satire is timely, but that doesn't mean that it'll remain timely into the future, so it must also have entertainment value that extends well beyond its perceived time frame. American Psycho does a great job on all of these fronts.Ellis' book actually is more of a critique on male behavior than a work seeking to lash out at women. Painting with extreme brush strokes makes the comparison more overt, but for those not seeking the true meaning of the piece the subtext is completely lost. The story of a man trying to fit in where he doesn't belong, with a dark streak underneath he keeps hidden from the world becomes a story of an author who is out to demoralize women. One has to wonder how many of American Psycho's detractors actually sat down to analyze the book beyond the violent passages.The violence in the movie was toned down quite a bit, which is naturally a necessity if you want a rating that still allows you to sell tickets. Don't get me wrong though: this still isn't a movie for the kiddies. The character is still an exaggerated form of the typical misogynist man, but the film focuses more on the inherent humor of the situation rather than on the violence.Christian Bale is the key here. Bale has a sixth sense for playing characters trying to keep it cool on the outside with turmoil underneath and a secret waiting to be shared with the world, but here there's a bit more levity and comedy to his performance. In particular the scene where he dispatches condescending executive Paul Allen shows his slightly more dark comedic side. Dancing around to Huey Lewis while donning a rain coat and carrying an ax, one can't help but laugh at Bale's manic energy while also questioning if they should.There's also that intensity that Bale brings to every role that is just kind of creepy disturbing. At one point in the film several executives compare business cards. To the viewer these cards look exactly the same from the paper they're printed on to the font used, but to the execs they all look different with each one being classier than the last. As Bale's Patrick Bateman views these you can see and feel his desperation as each card becomes progressively better than his. With this ""Mine is bigger than yours"" game, Bale demonstrates just how versatile an actor he can be when demonstrating the emotions of someone who doesn't want to be found out for who they really are.This film is brilliant in its eccentricities and its subtlety within an outrageous casing. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you give it a try. Whether you're a fan of Christian Bale, horror, lurid tales, or satire in general this is a must watch, and for some of you out there a must own!4/5For more reviews check out: jasoncwilkerson.blogspot.com",4,American Psycho,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,4410,"['are', 'better', 'ways', 'taking', 'care', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'just', 'censoring', 'would', 'much', 'prefer', 'see', 'skinned', 'alive', 'rat', 'put', 'up', 'rectum', 'genitals', 'cut', 'off', 'fried', 'frying', 'pan', 'front', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'audience', 'video', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'videos', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'art', 'free', 'expression', 'could', 'be', 'available', 'video', 'outlet', 'library', 'liquor', 'convenience', 'store', 'world', 'can', 'profit', 'Ellis', 'terror', 'pain', 'just', 'bookstores', 'are', 'profiting', 'rape', 'torture', 'mutilation', 'women', 'comment', 'feminist', 'activist', 'Tara', 'Baxter', 'concerning', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', '1991', 'novel', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Due', 'graphic', 'violent', 'content', 'mis', 'perceived', 'misogyny', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'controversy', 'including', 'Baxter', 'seeking', 'out', 'copies', 'book', 'stores', 'dump', 'blood', 'Naturally', 'spite', 'controversy', 'book', 'became', 'bestseller', 'Hollywood', 'must', 'be', 'acquired', 'become', 'next', 'big', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'average', 'investment', 'banking', 'executive', 'Wall', 'Street', 'So', 'average', 'fact', 'often', 'confused', 'other', 'executives', 'same', 'firm', 'faade', 'heart', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'hidden', 'rest', 'world', 'hatred', 'world', 'intensifies', 'though', 'murderous', 'tendencies', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'apparent.Satire', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'must', 'remain', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'clear', 'viewers', 'have', 'purpose', 'message', 'subtext', 'should', 'be', 'surface', 'never', 'overt', 'lot', 'times', 'satire', 'timely', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'remain', 'timely', 'future', 'must', 'also', 'have', 'entertainment', 'value', 'well', 'perceived', 'time', 'frame', 'American', 'Psycho', 'great', 'job', 'fronts.Ellis', 'book', 'actually', 'more', 'critique', 'male', 'behavior', 'work', 'seeking', 'lash', 'out', 'women', 'Painting', 'extreme', 'brush', 'strokes', 'comparison', 'more', 'overt', 'not', 'seeking', 'true', 'meaning', 'piece', 'subtext', 'completely', 'lost', 'story', 'man', 'trying', 'fit', 'where', ""n't"", 'belong', 'dark', 'streak', 'hidden', 'world', 'story', 'author', 'who', 'out', 'demoralize', 'women', 'One', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'American', 'Psycho', 'detractors', 'actually', 'sat', 'analyze', 'book', 'violent', 'passages.The', 'violence', 'movie', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'naturally', 'necessity', 'want', 'rating', 'still', 'sell', 'tickets', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', ""n't"", 'movie', 'kiddies', 'character', 'still', 'exaggerated', 'form', 'typical', 'misogynist', 'man', 'film', 'more', 'inherent', 'humor', 'situation', 'rather', 'violence.Christian', 'Bale', 'key', 'here', 'Bale', 'sixth', 'sense', 'playing', 'characters', 'trying', 'keep', 'cool', 'outside', 'turmoil', 'underneath', 'secret', 'waiting', 'be', 'shared', 'world', 'here', 'bit', 'more', 'levity', 'comedy', 'performance', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'condescending', 'executive', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'slightly', 'more', 'dark', 'comedic', 'side', 'Dancing', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'donning', 'rain', 'coat', 'carrying', 'ax', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'Bale', 'manic', 'energy', 'also', 'questioning', 'should.There', 'also', 'intensity', 'Bale', 'role', 'just', 'kind', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'several', 'executives', 'compare', 'business', 'cards', 'viewer', 'cards', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', 'paper', ""'re"", 'printed', 'font', 'used', 'execs', 'look', 'different', 'one', 'being', 'classier', 'last', 'Bale', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'desperation', 'card', 'progressively', 'better', 'Mine', 'bigger', 'yours', 'game', 'Bale', 'just', 'how', 'versatile', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'demonstrating', 'emotions', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'found', 'who', 'really', 'are.This', 'film', 'brilliant', 'eccentricities', 'subtlety', 'outrageous', 'casing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'try', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'horror', 'lurid', 'tales', 'satire', 'general', 'must', 'watch', 'must', 'own', '4/5For', 'more', 'reviews', 'check', 'out', 'jasoncwilkerson.blogspot.com']",American Psycho VHS
71920,A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,0783243499,Jason Stein,"[7, 9]","After looking over the reviews for American Psycho I felt I'd put my two cents in. I see that some people felt the movie was sub-par and others felt it to be a Christian Bale tour-de-force, while others either liked or  disliked the adaptation to the big screen, and still others who seemed like  they didn't get the message at all. I didn't read the book before seeing  the film. It has been my experience with most books that they don't end up  making better movies. I liked American Psycho because I knew that it was a  satire of American culture in the 1980's. The film delivered a satire that  showed the extremes of our culture and also mocked it. I found the film to  have multilayers, which is a good film in my book. Plotless, not exactly,  perhaps simple, but not plotless. Here is a man who works on Wall Street.  He has no social life of his own, no ideas that are his own, no feelings  that are his own. He is breaking down mentally living in this sterile  condition in which emotions are severly downplayed, ignored or ridiculed.  What's next? The next logical step the main character takes is to kill a  transient--who he states he can't relate to. He goes on to attempt to kill  some hookers and some co-workers. All for the sake of feeling alive, of  feeling individual, of having or making some meaning out of his life. Since  it is a satire of the 1980's &quot;me&quot; culture, Patrick Bateman and  his world underline this culture to its fullest and then exaggerate it. I  thought it was well done. I can't think of any other movie that so  eloquently and intelligently mocks the 1980's culture and society. Of  course, this was only a slice of America during the 80's and not the whole  story. Christian Bale turned in a fine,  stilted/controlled/obsessive-compulsive/calculating performance of a  character that slowly breaks down and snaps under the pressure of having to  live under the oppressive circumstances he encounters. I thought it was  well directed and acted as well as written. I also have a tendency to like  films that have some element of social commentary/human condition to them.  But, people will see what they want to with any film and there are plenty  of other interpretations that can be applied to this film. I just think  it's original and re-watchable, and years from now some people will refer  back to this film as a trendsetter, because I'm sure there will be other  films that reach a wider audience that deal with the same themes touched  upon here. Oh yeah, I noticed that some reviewers didn't understand the  chainsaw scene and how no one could notice him running down the hall after  the hooker...well...isn't that just another example of the 1980's  &quot;me&quot; culture? If everyone is so absorbed in themselves, as they  supposedly were in the 80's, then no one would notice a naked man with a  chainsaw running down the hall after a hooker would they?

Like other great novels about the American experience, ""American Psycho"" doesn't cover all the bases--America is too diverse for a single author to capture its total essence in a single novel. But what it does touch upon strikes at a central tenet of our society, namely our greed for things and our inability to strike a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and regulated market systems. We learned in the 1980s that ""Greed is good."" Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.Predictably, someone made a film based on the book--a director named Mary Harron to be exact--starring Christian Bale as the titular psycho Patrick Bateman. Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite. He is also, according to his own observations, a raving lunatic prone to outbursts of horrific violence. The smallest incidents cause our anti-hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money. He has a propensity to blurt out the most outrageous statements to his equally slick pals and numerous girlfriends, statements about heads on sticks and how he works in ""murders and executions,"" but no one seems to notice or care that much. Even more amazing, no one seems to notice Patrick Bateman lapsing into murderous insanity. But why would they? He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.In fact, we can never be entirely sure the murders and tortures are reality or just figments of Bateman's fragmented and vacuous personality. More likely these egregious acts, acts which include chasing a woman around an apartment building with a chainsaw or burying an axe in the noggin of an associate named Paul Allen (Jared Leto), represent attempts to feel something beyond the mere superficiality provided by material goods. Then again, maybe not. A cop named Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) does turn up at Bateman's office from time to time to inquire about the whereabouts of the aforementioned Allen. It's to the film's credit that we can never quite say for sure if Bateman is responsible for all of these atrocities, but that is also the conclusion we reach with the book. What we know for certain is how useless this guy's life really is. All he does is show up for work so he can goof off, listen to music, try and obtain reservations at the latest hip restaurants, and exercise. He's really nothing and he knows it. Watching these yuppies preen and prance through expensive set pieces evokes an equally useless class of do-nothings, i.e. the European nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Come to think of it, some of those barons, dukes, and earls engaged in mass murder as well.The only problem I had with the film version of ""American Psycho"" isn't really a major problem at all. In order to get a rating that would allow theaters to show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably. The book is loaded with stomach churning descriptions of Bateman's atrocities that only get worse as his insanity increases. Even an unrated version of the film couldn't begin to bring to the screen many of these nightmares, but that's o.k. What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role. In a film loaded with talent--including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, and Willem Dafoe--Bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic. His voiceovers describing his inner sensations send chills down the spine yet he's equally at ease with the book's black humor. It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade. If you haven't read the book, which I recommend before watching the film, you might need to view the picture several times to absorb the bleak social commentary.Extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette. I'll leave you with a typical Bateman statement: ""There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing."" Enough said, eh?",5,Oh so dark,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,5755,"['more', 'think', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'American', 'Psycho', 'more', 'consider', 'member', 'exclusive', 'Great',

71927,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0783243499,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","I've finally caught a full viewing of the ""American Psycho"" because every time it came on TV I would usually catch it towards the end then turn it off. First I must say I found the title somewhat misleading as I fully expected it to be another slasher flick, but it's actually a psychological thriller with a dash of satire.Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, gives a striking performance as a young, wealthy Wall Street yuppie, representing corporate America in the 1980's, where he and his peers are obsessed with getting into the trendiest restaurants and which of them possess the finest business cards. They all have the same haircut and wear the same business suits, rendering them nearly interchangeable and making for frequent cases of mistaken identity.Bateman, whose idea of foreplay is pontificating on the merits of his favorite 1980's songs, is disgusted with his fellow man's lust for material status and conformity. Lacking emotion, he acts on impulse and murders co-workers and clueless prostitutes while maintaining the facade of shallow, materialistic conformity. Unfortunately, the shallow lifestyle is the very thing that leaves him feeling empty inside and provokes the killings.The conclusion of the film leaves it to the audience to determine whether Bateman actually murdered anyone or if he merely fantasized the killings. Perhaps it was yet another case of mistaken identity, one which allowed Bateman to get away with murder. Of course American Psycho II (which I saw before part one) answers the question of whether or not he was a murderer. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Directed by a woman, American Psycho is a thought-provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind. It's a good one to watch especially for the price that Amazon is placing it for.",4,I must be crazy to watch this,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2079,"[""'ve"", 'finally', 'caught', 'full', 'viewing', 'American', 'Psycho', 'time', 'came', 'TV', 'would', 'usually', 'catch', 'end', 'then', 'turn', 'off', 'First', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'title', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'fully', 'expected', 'be', 'slasher', 'flick', 'actually', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'dash', 'satire.Christian', 'Bale', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'striking', 'performance', 'young', 'wealthy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'yuppie', 'representing', 'corporate', 'America', '1980', 'where', 'peers', 'are', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'trendiest', 'restaurants', 'possess', 'finest', 'business', 'cards', 'have', 'same', 'haircut', 'wear', 'same', 'business', 'suits', 'rendering', 'nearly', 'interchangeable', 'making', 'frequent', 'cases', 'mistaken', 'identity.Bateman', 'idea', 'foreplay', 'pontificating', 'merits', 'favorite', '1980', 'songs', 'disgusted', 'fellow', 'man', 'lust', 'material', 'status', 'conformity', 'Lacking', 'emotion', 'impulse', 'murders', 'co-workers', 'clueless', 'prostitutes', 'maintaining', 'facade', 'shallow', 'materialistic', 'conformity', 'Unfortunately', 'shallow', 'lifestyle', 'very', 'thing', 'feeling', 'empty', 'inside', 'killings.The', 'conclusion', 'film', 'audience', 'determine', 'Bateman', 'actually', 'murdered', 'anyone', 'merely', 'fantasized', 'killings', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'yet', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'one', 'allowed', 'Bateman', 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'course', 'American', 'Psycho', 'II', 'saw', 'part', 'one', 'question', 'not', 'was', 'murderer', 'movie', 'was', 'violent', 'not', 'much', 'book', 'However', 'think', 'blood', 'gore', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'overall', 'satire', 'film', 'turning', 'campy', 'horror', 'movie', 'film', 'had', 'not-so-clear', 'subtext', 'absurdity', 'killer', 'actions', 'motives', 'equal', 'rich', 'corporate', 'snob', 'Directed', 'woman', 'American', 'Psycho', 'thought-provoking', 'study', 'inner', 'workings', 'dark', 'twisted', 'mind', 'good', 'one', 'watch', 'especially', 'price', 'Amazon', 'placing']",American Psycho VHS
71928,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,0783243499,Jessica Lux,"[2, 2]","The release of American Psycho in 2000 was accompanied by many an outraged editorial about the gore-fest nature and loathsome treatment of women in the script.  It created a sensation, and although most editorialists got it completely wrong, I do applaud them for creating a buzz around this outstanding film.  Director Mary Harron transports the viewer to Manhattan in the 1980's, impeccably re-creating the outfits, interior d&eacute;cor, snotty theme restaurants, and modern art of the time.  The main characters consist of Patrick Bateman and his fellow Wal Street merger and acquisition Vice Presidents, all of whom sit in their offices looking important and dreaming up ways to one-up the other with new business card fonts or current event tid-bits.  They date socialites who are either zonked out on drugs or working hard climbing the right social ladders.Patrick is, of course, an American Psycho.  He's a fastidious, narcissistic serial killer.  He doesn't limit himself to just women, but the most fantastic scenes in the movie occur when he kills beautiful model-types.  The movie has a very simple and very powerful message:  Patrick is deranged, but so is everyone around him.  Everyone is as soul-less as Patrick, and when he tries to confess his crimes, the vacuous nature of his world renders his confession unbelievable to all his friends and associates.  There is a Realtor, in fact, who proves herself to be far more deranged than Patrick, and she commits no outright crime.This movie is a brilliant satire of a period piece.  The gore is mainly off-screen and subtle, and the murders are almost campy (Patrick running around condo hallways naked save for sneakers and a bloody chainsaw, anyone?).",5,"A satiric and rich visual depiction of a creepy, gory novel",1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,1717,"['release', 'American', 'Psycho', '2000', 'was', 'accompanied', 'many', 'outraged', 'editorial', 'gore-fest', 'nature', 'loathsome', 'treatment', 'women', 'script', 'created', 'sensation', 'most', 'editorialists', 'got', 'completely', 'wrong', 'do', 'applaud', 'creating', 'buzz', 'outstanding', 'film', 'Director', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'viewer', 'Manhattan', '1980', 'impeccably', 're-creating', 'outfits', 'interior', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'snotty', 'theme', 'restaurants', 'modern', 'art', 'time', 'main', 'characters', 'consist', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'fellow', 'Wal', 'Street', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'Vice', 'Presidents', 'whom', 'sit', 'offices', 'looking', 'important', 'dreaming', 'up', 'ways', 'one-up', 'other', 'new', 'business', 'card', 'fonts', 'current', 'event', 'tid-bits', 'date', 'socialites', 'who', 'are', 'zonked', 'out', 'drugs', 'working', 'hard', 'climbing', 'right', 'social', 'ladders.Patrick', 'course', 'American', 'Psycho', 'fastidious', 'narcissistic', 'serial', 'killer', ""n't"", 'limit', 'just', 'women', 'most', 'fantastic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'occur', 'when', 'beautiful', 'model-types', 'movie', 'very', 'simple', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'Patrick', 'deranged', 'so', 'everyone', 'Everyone', 'as', 'soul-less', 'Patrick', 'when', 'confess', 'crimes', 'vacuous', 'nature', 'world', 'confession', 'unbelievable', 'friends', 'associates', 'Realtor', 'fact', 'who', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'deranged', 'Patrick', 'outright', 'crime.This', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'period', 'piece', 'gore', 'mainly', 'off-screen', 'subtle', 'murders', 'are', 'almost', 'campy', 'Patrick', 'running', 'around', 'condo', 'hallways', 'naked', 'save', 'sneakers', 'bloody', 'chainsaw', 'anyone']",American Psycho VHS

He seems like a perfect man for any woman but underneath that skin he is a vicious coldblooded murderer that loves taunting, raping and mutilating his victims especially keeping their bodies in the closet but how long can he bring back his sanity?A chilling and ultraviolent horror thriller based on a novel is quite an interesting and gory satire on yuppies in the 80's, there's quite a bit of sex such as the gorgeous Reese Weitherspoon half naked in one scene and of course graphic violence like nailgun massacres, chainsaw murders and that kind of thing.

His life is centered around material things. He has to have the best of everything, and on many levels, he does. He tries his hardest to fit in, and in the most part, he succeeds. But in the back of his head, the sense of not being good enough in his high-class environment is eating away at him, and sends him into uncontrolable violent frenzies, that may or may not have just been dreamed up in his troubled brain, and never actually happened. Based on, and highly toned down from, Brett Easton Ellis' extremely graphic and controversial novel, American Psycho is a suspense/thriller that does not even come near the realm of subtlety (except when compared to the book). This film characterizes the lives of a pack of rich, young urban professionals (or Yuppies, if you rather), in a satirical way, but also does not make us forget that it is a suspense film. Their greed and disgust are their only emotions, but only seemingly more so in our protagonist. Some of the amusing little scenes (ex. Bateman and his friends bickering over who has the most tasteful business card) may just seem like interesting filler to the untrained eye, but when thought about deeply, makes you think about how mentally different these people are. If squeamish, I suggest you read the book first, to make the movie seem a little tamer. But if you want it more shocking and suspenseful, by all means, see the movie first.

Tackling this massive, bitterly cynical satirical (and at times boring) book, and giving it a focus, heart, and soul is nothing short of amazing! I congratulate the filmmakers and upgrade my review from three to four star ratings.Initial review prior to reading the book: I never read the book but intend to now. I really never had interest in seeing this movie because I utterly despise horror movies which I thought this is. As it started to unfold I said to my wife this is not a horror film, but a sophsticated  New York thriller (not realzing the writer was British). The dialogue impressed me (I didn't know it came from the book). I loved him taking offense to the anti-Semitic remaks of his idiot Wall Street colleague. Then I wondered how Bateman can carry a dead body across the lobby trailing blood and nothing happened. Then it became so absurd I started to lay back and laugh because it was so over the top. It took until the closing scenes(visit to what we thought was Paul's apartment) for me to finally realize that we've been cleverly manipulated and all the murders were all in Bateman's head, fantasies. Then I finally realized it was a twisted satire. Now I need to see it all again to sure, but after I read the book. The social commentary was kinda lost but I thought the music trivia was great, fitting in with Tarantino's and TV influenced writing which resorts to a lot of off-the-nose trivia. Do I recommend this film? Yes. If you haven't read the book, it's grippng in its own twisted way and Bale is great. You really believe he's crazy, which he is, even if find out later it's all in his head.

Christian Bale is an incredible actor and his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho"" is unforgettable.  Bale's Patrick Bateman is drop-dead gorgeous, cut, successful, swaggering, demented, obsessed and, of course, p-s-y-c-h-o. And comedic in a very, very dark way.  His livingroom scene with Jared Leto (his nemesis in the movie) is so disturbing you DO indeed catch yourself grinning.  Patrick's obsession with Jared Leto's character AND business cards, helps the viewer understand that Patrick is not just insanely jealous -- he IS insane.Women in this movie are just meat for Patrick's grinder.  He enjoys killing.  Women are easy to kill.  He has easy access to women so, hey, why not slaughter them?  The types of women he attracts are apparently  as shallow as he is with the exception of the street prostitute who you will probably feel sympathy for.If anyone begins this movie envying or admiring Patrick Bateman and still does at the end of the movie, I would suggest they too are crazy.  Patrick is probably every human being's worst nightmare.  The guy takes himself and his position in life WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.  He indulges his every desire (mostly sadistic).  He is a leech.  A vampire.  He takes and gives nothing back.  You can knock on his door and nobody's home.

Just watch Christian Bale's over-the-top performance - everything is played for laughs.  The murders are not the focus of the film - rather it is Bale's narration as he comments on all things `80s: everything from his in-depth analysis of pop artists like Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis, to his grooming ritual, to whatever hot spots were popular in New York back then.The eighties as satirized in the movie are an idea that never really existed - much like Patrick's idea of himself.  I vaguely remember some of the places he talks about in Manhattan, but they were trends - like anything else.  Even the yuppies back then who agonized over getting the right seat at the right restaurant and having the perfect look and business card didn't even really believe in those things themselves.  They were all playacting, whether they knew it or not.It is a wise decision to downplay the horror aspects of the movie.  Sadly I have not read the book.  I hear that is very misogynistic.  I don't know about that but the hero-villain, Patrick Bateman, certainly is.  Violence against women is not something we need to see more of.  It is present in the film, so be prepared for some offensive scenes.This movie, like other movies about the eighties, play best as nostalgia.

I thought it would be part of the ""I Still Know What Mrs. Tingle Did With You Idle Hands Last Friday the 13th"" routine, but this individual and occasionally stunning feature is a real horror film for a real adult audience.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a respected Wall Street businessman by day. Outside of work, though, he is an accomplished serial killer. After the murder of a rival, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), a private investigator (Willem Dafoe) starts to pick up his trail as Bateman starts to go mental in covering his tracks.The plot is fairly thin on the ground, and the film has a poor shoot-out finale, but this is still an imaginable, carefully crafted film that is highly controversial because of it's continuous violence and rather odd sexual themes, but Christian Bale and Mary Harron work excellently and co-operate well together to make this film hugely successful with both critics and our friends at the box office. The film has a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror-thriller type, you won't be disappointed. There is no shortage of shocks; one immediately scary part is where Bateman chases his regular prostitute around a hotel room with a terrifying chainsaw sound. Christian Bale's performance is another great thing about this great movie; he perfectly catches Bateman's rise and fall with excellent acting skills and awesome narration.Both hip and cool, American Psycho is an underrated little movie that deserves praise.",4,"Mature, black and spooky.",984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,1562,"['American', 'PsychoScore', '78/100American', 'Psycho', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'Still', 'Know', 'What', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'Did', 'Idle', 'Hands', 'Last', 'Friday', '13th', 'routine', 'individual', 'occasionally', 'stunning', 'feature', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'real', 'adult', 'audience.Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'respected', 'Wall', 'Street', 'businessman', 'day', 'work', 'though', 'accomplished', 'serial', 'killer', 'murder', 'rival', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'private', 'investigator', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'pick', 'up', 'trail', 'Bateman', 'go', 'mental', 'covering', 'tracks.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'thin', 'ground', 'film', 'poor', 'shoot-out', 'finale', 'still', 'imaginable', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'film', 'highly', 'controversial', 'continuous', 'violence', 'rather', 'odd', 'sexual', 'themes', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'work', 'excellently', 'co-operate', 'well', 'together', 'make', 'film', 'hugely', 'successful', 'critics', 'friends', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'lot', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'moments', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'horror-thriller', 'type', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'shortage', 'shocks', 'one', 'immediately', 'scary', 'part', 'where', 'Bateman', 'regular', 'prostitute', 'hotel', 'room', 'terrifying', 'chainsaw', 'sound', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'great', 'thing', 'great', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Bateman', 'rise', 'fall', 'excellent', 'acting', 'skills', 'awesome', 'hip', 'cool', 'American', 'Psycho', 'underrated', 'little', 'movie', 'praise']",American Psycho VHS
71949,A18BV4O63DOWNH,0783243499,"""juno2""","[2, 9]","Mary Harron's  *American Psycho*  is not a BAD movie, necessarily; it just isn't much of a movie.  It certainly fails at satire, because you obviously need a target worth satirizing, and -- I'm sorry -- 1980's-era yuppies were ALREADY ridiculous to begin with.  How can you make them more ridiculous than they already were?  It's like making fun of game show hosts -- an exercise in redundancy.Harron has said that she has attempted to  &quot;rescue&quot;  the book by Bret Ellis from its bad reputation.  (Why bother?)  Her strategy is, first of all, to make this film a period-piece, i.e., cell phones bigger than one's head; that ghastly  &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot;  thing that was going on in New York and L.A.; Walkmans; Huey Lewis and the News . . . so forth.  Of course, by putting the murderous subtext so firmly in the past, you tend to distance the movie from all the blood our serial killer spills.  As I watched all this, I was thinking that there was no good reason NOT to have this movie set in the present day.  I mean, let me get this straight:  people have NOT made a killing on Wall Street in the 90's?  people quit wearing Walkmans?  is  &quot;fusion&quot;  cuisine any better than  &quot;nouvelle&quot;?  are the Spice Girls less tacky than Huey Lewis?  In other words, we're in no position to sit back smugly and laugh at the trends of ten or fifteen years ago.Other failures:  the stilted dialogue and narration, which, I take it, is directly from the book.  (Now I KNOW I'll never read the dang thing.)  Christian Bale's impossible task is to give convincing readings of lines like  &quot;Phil Collins'  solo work is more commerical, and therefore satisfying in a narrower way.&quot;  Sheesh!  This isn't a real person.  I like Bale, but this is an unplayable part -- there isn't a believable moment in it.  However, the satire does get sharper when the yuppies are sitting around comparing business cards.  The film is almost worth watching for that scene alone -- it's hilarious.But Harron is so intimidated by her material!  Every frame shouts  &quot;Don't get mad!  It's a satire!  It's a satire!&quot;  Not that I was counting, but doesn't Bale end up killing more MEN than women?  You better believe this was by design.  The reason we know of Ellis'  book in the first place was its graphic description of mutilations perpetrated upon women.  There's virtually nothing like that in this movie.  And to further neuter the material, we're led to believe at the end that all of it was in the guy's head, anyway.

71954,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0783243499,K. Driscoll,"[6, 7]","Mary Harron's film is a depiction of the Bret Easton Ellis (Rules of Attraction, Less Than Zero) controversial novel of the same name.  It's only significant difference is that it leaves out some of the more gruesome scenarios in Ellis's book.  I'm not sure whether that's a drawback or not but there was some rage missing in our killer's actions.  The film operates as a first person narrative and contains the same kind of oddball combinations of extreme violence and dark humor.  This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.  Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.  Everything about this movie feels like the late 1980s.  She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.  From what I understand Harron also fought hard to keep the role of Patrick Bateman (the title character and the story's protagonist) in the capable hands of Christian Bale.  Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.Patrick Bateman is a 27 year-old wealthy and successful investor.  He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra-competitive background.  We follow him around and listen to all of his observations of the world he lives in.  This is of course the yuppie culture of the 1980s. Perhaps Bateman is the extreme yuppie and a harbinger to the ills of this socially produced subgroup and the culture they exist in.  As it turns out his world features the substantiality that he is indeed a murderer.  Unfortunately no one seems to notice this, despite his blatant and at times hilariously dry claims that he is a psycho.  Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.  American Psycho, like the novel, is a great satire that might leave viewers with some frustrating questions in the end.  What was real and what was imaginary?The rest of the cast includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chlo Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.  All are fairly effective within their roles but the film weighed heavily on Bale's performance.  He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind-blowingly shallow and overly competitive monster he is.The thing that surprises most is that a great female director like Harron decided to take on a story so pervasively accused of misogyny.  Harron's other films are about a radical feminist (Valerie Salanas in I Shot Andy Warhol) and an icon of women's liberation (Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page).  I almost think she intentionally went against the grain here to break out of the mold Hollywood can often create for women and minority directors.  Good for her.  Her movies are interesting and American Psycho is a stand-out.",4,"""I like to dissect girls.

It is a movie where it expounds on the life of a rich wallstret suck up who is going insane, and indeed does crack a little. With a surprising, believable twist, with Ptrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) going on a murder spree. No plot spoilers here, what I said was in the trailers.The sad, miserable life of this rich man finally empties his soul of what little emotion he had left, where he vents his frustrations on his assistant and on unwitting victims.Watch the movie to see the suck up go from polite to maniacal. A little too disturbing for my tastes, some parts seemed sad because Christian Bale plays such a supreme performance.

Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wallstreet suit whose life is the material world.  He is a self-loving, materialistic s.o.b. who has a little hobby on the side.  He loves to kill people.Some may find the acting dull, but the character of Bateman is just that.  He lives his life like it is a movie and he is just merely going along for the ride.  Those that get in his way just end up being killed, violently(the violence is shown off screen).  Bateman has absolutely no human emotions such as joy and pain.The ending of the movie will surprise the viewers and really make them wonder what actually happened and what Bateman just imagined.  It gets trippy and weird.  I just wish the dvd had a commentary track as to explain what the hell was really going on.  Still,  the movie delivers its message across to the those with an open mind.American Psycho truly satires the upperclass of the late 80s with a murderous twist.  People make reservations in restaurants just cause they can, not cause they're hungry.  They snort coke, use prostitutes, and compare the type of paper and the fonts of their business cards.  When they're at work, they seem at the top of their game.  Once at home,  they're rather dull.There are some truly laugh out loud moments in this movie if you have a twisted mind.

Bernabo,"[1, 5]","The argument was that &quot;American Psycho&quot; was not really a look at a serial killer but rather a satirical expose on yuppie executives circa the mid-1980s. However, as far as I am concerned this 2000 film fails on both scores. There is a lot of blood but neither a sense of horror nor suspense, which is usually what you want to find in a thriller. As for the social satire, the problem is that the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and the rest of his wall street execu-yuppies are all so fake, more reminiscent of a comedy sketch on &quot;Mad TV&quot; than anything else, and I would think the point would be to capture more of the real essence of such a life (e.g., &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; or &quot;The Boiler Room&quot;).The film was directed by Mary Harron (&quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;), who also did the screenplay, which probably explains why the Bret Easton Ellis novel has been toned down for the silver screen. The point being made, as near as I can tell, is that Patrick Bateman kills people, not because he is so very different from everyone else around him, but essentially because he is just like the rest of his cohorts, only more so. Some of the murders appear to be random and others the result of jealousy, but sometimes the best answer is that the death speaks to Bateman's vanity. The whole opening of &quot;American Psycho&quot; is an introduction to his narcissism, which means it provides the prime motivation for not only his murderous outbursts but also everything else in his life.Because everything fits the pattern I have to work from the premise that the film is what the director intended, but it just does not achieve the desired result. My prediction is that if you bother to watch this film, then at some point you are going to burst out laughing and dollars to donuts it will be for some unintentional reason. Furthermore, as you watch the film you will find yourself thinking of a whole lot of films that suddenly look a lot better when compared to &quot;American Psycho&quot; (&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; were just the first two that came to mind). I am willing to grant that Harron was trying to do something to redeem the original novel, but this film just fails across the board, whether we are talking the sex and the violence or the psychological insights and social satire.",3,This film fails as both a social satire and a splatter flick,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2376,"['argument', 'was', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'look', 'serial', 'killer', 'rather', 'satirical', 'expose', 'yuppie', 'executives', 'circa', 'mid-1980s', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', '2000', 'film', 'fails', 'scores', 'lot', 'blood', 'sense', 'horror', 'suspense', 'usually', 'what', 'want', 'find', 'thriller', 'social', 'satire', 'problem', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'rest', 'wall', 'street', 'execu-yuppies', 'are', 'so', 'fake', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'comedy', 'sketch', 'quot', 'Mad', 'TV', 'quot', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'think', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'capture', 'more', 'real', 'essence', 'life', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'quot', 'quot', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'quot', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'quot', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'quot', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'screenplay', 'probably', 'why', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'silver', 'screen', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'as', 'can', 'tell', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'people', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'essentially', 'just', 'rest', 'cohorts', 'only', 'more', 'so', 'murders', 'appear', 'be', 'random', 'others', 'result', 'jealousy', 'sometimes', 'best', 'answer', 'death', 'speaks', 'Bateman', 'vanity', 'whole', 'opening', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'introduction', 'narcissism', 'prime', 'motivation', 'not', 'only', 'murderous', 'outbursts', 'also', 'everything', 'else', 'life.Because', 'everything', 'pattern', 'have', 'work', 'premise', 'film', 'what', 'director', 'intended', 'just', 'not', 'achieve', 'desired', 'result', 'prediction', 'bother', 'watch', 'film', 'then', 'point', 'are', 'going', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'dollars', 'donuts', 'will', 'be', 'unintentional', 'reason', 'Furthermore', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'thinking', 'whole', 'lot', 'films', 'suddenly', 'look', 'lot', 'better', 'when', 'compared', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'quot', 'quot', 'Showgirls', 'quot', 'were', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'came', 'mind', 'am', 'willing', 'grant', 'Harron', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'redeem', 'original', 'novel', 'film', 'just', 'board', 'are', 'talking', 'sex', 'violence', 'psychological', 'insights', 'social', 'satire']",American Psycho VHS

The film is also horrible, funny and essential, but it ain't the book.  Mary Harron wisely decided not to do a Cannibal Holocaust on this one, and emphasised instead the black humour.  She and co-screenwriter Guenevere Turner (who'd have thought that that nice girl from Go Fish could end up writing American Psycho?) deliver the funniest film about twisted men since Fight Club.Despite the contributions of Harron, Turner, the production designer, the cinematographer and the rest of the cast, it has to be said that this is Christian Bale's movie.  Leonardo Di Caprio just isn't in this league.  Bale transformed himself into an extraordinary simulacrum of a human being, a perfectly-accented, tautly-muscled, immaculately groomed Americanoid boy, whose cheery smile is constantly belied by eyes as dead as gun muzzles.  He's the most memorable cinema nutcase in a mainstream film since Travis Bickle.  The scene when he puts Huey Lewis on the stereo, dresses in a plastic raincoat and dances round the room preparatory to putting an axe into Jared Leto's head made me almost puke with laughter, and his instant turnaround into a frothing, bawling maniac is quite incredible.  His breakdown later on in the film almost makes you sympathise with this utterly hollow character.It's pretty unthinkable that American Psycho will get an Oscar, but Bale proves himself to be one of the most technically adept and assured actors of his generation with this performance.  Slasher film fans will be let down (I saw it in a cinema in Plymouth UK, with an audience of people who clearly expected a Manhattan Chainsaw Massacre and who were audibly disappointed not to get it) but it's a sublimely horrible and great film.

The movie satirizes the yuppie culture of materialism, using a modern day ""Ted Bundy"" serial killer.  American Psycho is set in the 1980's and Patrick Bateman is a broker in New York.  His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.  It all seems so meaningless and sterile as they arrogantly discuss what trendy restaurant to eat dinner at each night at a local club.Patrick Batemen lives in a expensive New York apartment and starts each morning with a shower and narcissistic regimen of skin care.  He is misogynistic, and self centered, spending time with same-aged colleagues sharing a obsession over classy business cards, designer glasses, ties and suits.  His public personality hides a murderous rage at small frustrations.  When his anger mounts then it is taken out on anyone, including his do-worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.  During the murders he plays music and critiques the songs of Huey Lewis and Phil Collins.  Chloe Sevigny plays Patrick's secretary and Reese Witherspoon plays his fiance.  Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.  Although there are many murders in the movie, the actual killing scenes are not graphic, although plenty of blood and bodies are seen throughout.  Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona - clean cut professional - just like Ted Bundy.  Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag - is it Armani?

I've seen that motif in countless other movies, and American Psycho offers no new spin on the theme, save the fact that he gets his kicks out of mutilating and murdering people. In the end, the viewer discovers that none of the murders were even real, merely figments of a warped imagination.It is, however, a mildly amusing movie, has some excellent photography, and Christian Bale does an ok job portraying the main character. But, like the vapid and soulless lifestyle it purports to criticize, American Psycho dances around the same tired and superficial images, content with just looking stylish without tackling anything substantial. It is a frustrating movie because it so desparately wants to be a biting satire, a work of art, and comes pretty close in a few scenes.

Marry Harron's visual tricks imply most of the carnage, which may not be as disturbing as the scenes Ellis described, but do the trick all the same.Like all well-crafted satires of late, &quot;American Psycho&quot; finds humor in the extremes of human behavior and the horrors we unleash on one another.

When it was published nearly ten years ago, it was met with a storm of controversy. Its quite graphic violence caused critics to overlook the book's central theme, which is that a society awash in materialism will lose its collective soul. As the main character puts it, ""The only true emotions I feel are disgust and greed."" Originally, Oliver Stone wanted to film it using Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Patrick Bateman. I can see Leo D. in the part, but I imagine Stone would have made a very violent and very loud mess of it. Finally, the project was placed in the hands of director Mary Harron, and she wisely chose to emphasis the book's satirical and comedic elements over its violence. The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for. Whether or not it is also entertainment depends on each viewer's tastes.Christian Bale gives the performance of his life as Patrick Bateman. Patrick is a young man who is the epitome of a soulless success. Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York. He works out religiously. He is fanatical about his appearance, and his morning routine of getting himself cleaned up, made up and dressed for work would put any movie star to shame. His wardrobe is impeccable. His haircut is perfect. Even his business cards are designed to be the best. Any coworker who dresses better or looks better than Patrick is considered to be competition and, thus, one of the enemy. His carefully contrived personal appearance goes far beyond the masks we knew in the past. It is more of a tool than his words or his actions. It is also a trap and a weapon. Yet most of the people Patrick knows seem to be using the same weapon, while Patrick is the only one who knows that behind the facade there is usually only emptiness. In this pursuit of meaningless physical and material perfection, he has also gone stark raving mad. He finally snaps. One evening he takes Paul Allen [Jared Leto], his fiercest competitor, out to dinner and then to his apartment, where he coldly and calculatedly kills him with an ax. When the police question him about the missing Allen, he coolly throws them off the track. At the same time, as his madness takes complete control, he goes on a murderous rampage.American Psycho is not a slasher flick nor is a thriller. It is a satirical black comedy that makes a valid attempt to show the ultimate futility of a relatively small but influential segment of American society. It does not always succeed, especially towards the end, because the violence ultimately becomes too numbing. This fact does not prevent it from being one of 2000's more original movies, and it does nothing to overshadow the enormous talents of its star and its director.",4,Interesting adaptation puts satire ahead of violence,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2894,"['American', 'Psycho', 'long', 'delayed', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'When', 'was', 'published', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'met', 'storm', 'controversy', 'quite', 'graphic', 'violence', 'caused', 'critics', 'overlook', 'book', 'central', 'theme', 'society', 'awash', 'materialism', 'will', 'lose', 'collective', 'soul', 'main', 'character', 'only', 'true', 'emotions', 'feel', 'are', 'disgust', 'greed', 'Originally', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'film', 'using', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'protagonist', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'can', 'see', 'Leo', 'D.', 'part', 'imagine', 'Stone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'violent', 'very', 'loud', 'mess', 'Finally', 'project', 'was', 'placed', 'hands', 'director', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'wisely', 'chose', 'emphasis', 'book', 'satirical', 'comedic', 'elements', 'violence', 'result', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'filming', 'novel', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'Whether', 'not', 'also', 'entertainment', 'viewer', 'tastes.Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'life', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Patrick', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'epitome', 'soulless', 'success', 'Wickedly', 'bright', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'big', 'bucks', 'working', 'high', 'powered', 'finanical', 'concern', 'New', 'York', 'out', 'religiously', 'fanatical', 'appearance', 'morning', 'routine', 'getting', 'cleaned', 'up', 'made', 'up', 'dressed', 'work', 'would', 'put', 'movie', 'star', 'shame', 'wardrobe', 'impeccable', 'haircut', 'perfect', 'Even', 'business', 'cards', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'best', 'coworker', 'who', 'better', 'better', 'Patrick', 'considered', 'be', 'competition', 'thus', 'one', 'enemy', 'carefully', 'contrived', 'personal', 'appearance', 'far', 'masks', 'knew', 'past', 'more', 'tool', 'words', 'actions', 'also', 'trap', 'weapon', 'most', 'people', 'Patrick', 'seem', 'be', 'using', 'same', 'weapon', 'Patrick', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'facade', 'usually', 'only', 'emptiness', 'pursuit', 'meaningless', 'physical', 'material', 'perfection', 'also', 'gone', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'finally', 'One', 'evening', 'Paul', 'Allen', '[', 'Jared', 'Leto', ']', 'fiercest', 'competitor', 'dinner', 'then', 'apartment', 'where', 'coldly', 'calculatedly', 'ax', 'When', 'police', 'question', 'missing', 'Allen', 'coolly', 'off', 'track', 'same', 'time', 'madness', 'complete', 'control', 'murderous', 'rampage.American', 'Psycho', 'not', 'slasher', 'flick', 'thriller', 'satirical', 'black', 'comedy', 'valid', 'attempt', 'show', 'ultimate', 'futility', 'relatively', 'small', 'influential', 'segment', 'American', 'society', 'not', 'always', 'succeed', 'especially', 'end', 'violence', 'ultimately', 'too', 'numbing', 'fact', 'not', 'prevent', 'being', 'one', '2000', 'more', 'original', 'movies', 'nothing', 'overshadow', 'enormous', 'talents', 'star', 'director']",American Psycho VHS

He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to. He compares business cards with fellow friends and makes reservations at the newest and hottest restaurants... just because. He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch. He's meticulous and anal in everything he does. He's also a homicidal maniac. He kills for fun and he kills for release and he kills for hatred. After one of his murders though, a homicide cop begins too get a little too close for comfort of figuring out that Patrick could be the killer and Patrick begins to unravel from his calm demeanor.Never having read the book the movie is based on; I went into this movie blind. And loved it. It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is. Like when he's talking about his facial mask. As he begins to peel it off after 10 minutes of having it on, you really just cant help see him telling us that what is on his outside is not who he is on the inside. He's not your friend. Not your coworker. Not your lover. He's a friggin soulless killer. It is crazy to think that someone could be so cold and emotionless, but yet there are people out there that are like that. I don't believe for a second that he got 100% pleasure out of all of his kills. Some seemed like he just couldn't help it. Like we might go get a massage, have sex, or just sit on the beach for some relaxation. He would kill.Not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny. Dark funny though. Seeing him get massively pissed off over someone's business cards is too funny. And not in the ha-ha kind of funny way, but in the `holy crap he's getting pissed over nothing' kind of way. And flexing in the mirror while having sex with two girls? Legendary. And chasing someone down a hallway, butt nekid except for high tops, and a chainsaw? Once again... Legendary. And when he says things out loud such as ""I'm into murders and executions"" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny. There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys. I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it...lol.Christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure. I love how he seems different in all his parts he plays. Not a lot different, but he just is. It's almost subtle, but he's not really ever the same. But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something. I'm not gay, but the man has a great body. And to do what he does with it is crazy. I'll never forget the way he looked like a dang holocaust victim in The Mechanist and then like a few months later he was Batman or something. Crazy.P.S. - So I'm not afraid to say I don't understand the ending. I can't tell what was going on at the end. Is he a killer for real...or is it in his head? For instance...he blew up a cop car with a pistol. Even he looked at his gun like `wtf?' And then after his confession, even his lawyer said he was kidding around. Was he? Or was the lawyer covering for him? I was confused. Anyone want to help me out?

71992,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,0783243499,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[6, 9]","I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw this movie, having not then read the book it's based (albeit somewhat loosely) on. I actually found myself grinning and even laughing aloud while watching this movie, which made me feel sort of guilty...was I supposed to laugh when people were getting butchered gruesomely right and left? Was it really a vicious slasher flick? An 80s nostalgia flick? Or was it a social satire?Actually, it is a bit of all three, though primarily it is a very well-done bit of social satire, commenting on the excesses of the late 1980s by examining one man, Patrick Bateman, played with total yuppie abandon by the remarkable Christian Bale. Bateman is a Wall Street high-flyer, completely lacking in importance but rich enough to give the appearance of it. He is a consummate performer, an empty shell of a man clad in expensive Valentino suits and cared for with the finest products pour l'homme. He blithely admits that he lacks any sort of human emotion except greed and ambition, and this becomes fairly obvious almost immediately; his face is usually fixed in an empty perma-grin, and his voice is rather high-pitched, with that hollow sort of forced cheerfulness that self-help gurus and promoters on late-night infomercials have.This is entirely suitable for Bateman; he is the consummate consumer, far more interested in spending time with his daily personal care routine than in developing any real human relationships. He describes this skin-care and exercise regimen in a lengthy monologue, in fact, near the opening of the film. It is one of the film's most entertaining moments: its unabashed, preening vanity is hysterical, and the sequence is not hurt any by frequent displays of Bale's extremely well-cut physique. Bale uses his physicality as part of his roles, and always has: here he has the well-defined, bulked-up body of a Greek god and clearly spends most of his free time exercising to the point of obsession. This enhances the image of Bateman as a total narcissist, and plays along very well with the 80s obsession with exercise and weight.When he is not discussing himself, Bateman talks mainly about music and pop culture. He delivers paeans to the corporate gods of the music industry: Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis and the News, MOR - anyone whose work justifies the solipsistic lifestyle he leads - but what he says is often so self-contradictory we wonder if he's actually thought about any of it, or learned it wholesale from the album covers and magazines. His monologuing is usually amusing, but we learn fairly quickly that it is not a good sign; people have a tendency to die when Bateman starts talking about music. In fact, people have a tendency to die when they're around Bateman in general, and this only increases in frequency as the movie progresses.There are many murders in this film, but the viewer is gratefully spared seeing any of them in any sort of detail. The book goes into grisly, delighted in an almost Julia Child-ish way, detail about the killings; here director Mary Harron has the good sense to keep much of the gore off-screen. It was not, in fact, for violence and gore that the film originally got an NC-17 rating, but for a rather risqu&eacute; three-way sex scene. Five or six seconds cut from the theatrical release (but restored on this ""uncut"" DVD along with eight other scenes, of varying quality and importance) got it an R-rating instead, but honestly, unless you really pay attention you'll never notice the added footage, and it's no more graphic than what was left in.The film definitely deserves its R-rating, but the violence and the sex are done in such a way that they are not mean or vicious towards the victims, only towards Bateman, who is never made to look anything but a total idiot. These scenes are really more humourous than revolting, though that sounds callous to those who haven't seen the film. Bateman is such a priss, such a total narcissist, that it is impossible to admire or sympathize with him. We cannot believe that the murders are going on anywhere except inside his head; we suspect he's too air-headed to really be capable of killing. Harron does not explicitly say this is the case, but it is more than implied: trails of blood vanish miraculously, chainsaws are aimed impossibly well, people who are supposed to have been murdered turn up mysteriously at restaurants, apartments full of corpses become miraculously empty. Bateman has a way of occupying empty space that makes him completely unmemorable even to his own lawyer, and the end of the film is the strongest argument for everything having gone on in his own twisted mind.Christian Bale is a complete marvel in this role. I have been a fan since his heart-wrenching performance ages ago in ""Empire of the Sun,"" though here he has clearly grown up and could not be more different. It speaks well for his versatility that he could go from the youthfully innocent Demetrius in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" the year before, to the utterly indifferent Patrick Bateman here, to the stoic and thoroughly decent Mandras in ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" the year after. This may be because Bale seems to lack any shred of self-preservation, completely giving himself over to his characters.Here, he completely inhabits Bateman whilst simultaneously making him a 24-hour performer himself. There is nothing to Patrick Bateman: he is all posture and gesture, ""sound and fury signifying nothing,"" and Bale nails this in a dead-on performance that is far more nuanced than is often acknowledged. This is a role that could easily make an actor look ridiculous, even repulsive, yet Bale manages by throwing caution to wind to make him, if not believable, acceptable in his own peculiar fashion. It takes a very distinct courage to run down a corridor, blood-spattered and wearing nothing but tennis-shoes, bearing a mirror-polished gleaming chainsaw and screaming at the top of one's lungs. Bale has it, and manages to be so ludicrous and off-the-wall in this scene that I had time to notice that he wasn't wearing socks in his shoes, and could be more offended by this than the thought of the chainsaw. This sort of response is essential to the proper understanding and enjoyment of this movie.The film is strongest as a commentary and exposition of the 1980s yuppie quest for world domination, though some may complain Harron is a one-note director and hammers her point home a little too well. The 80s were a decade of total narcissism, when it was ""hip to be square,"" greed was good, and one's social importance was determined largely by what restaurants one could get into on a Friday night. (This is, in fact, the inspiration for one of Bateman's murderous rages.) By carrying these themes into the exaggerated, hyper-macho world of corporate takeovers, Harron is able to more fully explore them. Here, Bateman's murders become the logical if radical extensions of Wall Street's corporate aggressiveness, and ""mergers and acquisitions"" are not so far removed from ""murders and executions,"" and his utter indifference to anyone but himself is the reasonable end of the dehumanizing of the corporate machine.",4,Unconventional but funny,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,7205,"['was', ""n't"",

72001,A182CY2NWMR6XT,0783243499,"Miguel ""Writer, Journalist, Film Critic""","[1, 2]","Patrick Bateman, the yuppie serial killer du jour created by Bret Easton Ellis, is obsessed with all things superficial. Ellis' written world is full of super-attractive young men with secret killer ways. He wallows in his protagonist's masochistic behavior and only occasionally manages to step back and comment on his behavior on a larger scale. Patrick Bateman is intended to be the metaphor for Reaganism on the kill but somehow this message is muddled amidst the non-stop name-dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings.Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) one-ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation. The fact that many designers did not grant Harron the permission to use their names in the film could have been a Godsend because it forces Harron to focus on the more relevant nuances of her character. Harron brilliantly establishes Bateman's attraction for all things narcissistic in a scene where he describes his daily facial rejuvenating process while standing in front of his bathroom mirror. If you combine that moment with Bateman's non-stop exercise regime and his desire to dine at the fanciest of restaurants, you have a Bateman that is concerned with nothing more than his own beautification.The infamous threesome scene that slapped the film with an NC-17 rating is a great one because it shows Bateman, played with astonishing madness by Christian Bale, completely detached from the act of sex. Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex. While having sex with the women he looks at himself in the mirror. He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.Although Patrick Bateman is a completely loathsome soul, Harron appropriately adds a certain human element to her psycho killer. Even though Bateman admits over voice-over that he is devoid of any emotion there is a scene in the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself. After bringing his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) to his apartment, he has her leave after telling her that if she doesn't he might do something horrible to her.Bateman's sadistic ways are certainly a product of some twisted childhood or adult experiences but Harron does not choose to focus on this. There is a tongue-in-cheek moment where Bateman apologizes to a dinner-date for being late by saying that he is a `product of divorce' but this is about the only glimpse we get into the character's pre-killer days. It's as if Harron is flippantly teasing us with the comment, knowing that we are itching for some sort of Freudian psychoanalysis of her character.The gore is at a significantly lesser scale than one would be expected considering source material. Aside from one astonishingly executed sequence where a prostitute (Cara Seymour) flees from Patrick down some stairs, the killings in the film are handled in a comedic, albeit disturbing, way. The women in the film do not get much characterization but this is an appropriate thing when you consider that the film is shot through Bateman's eyes, a man that is little concerned with the motivations of his victims.There is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan. They blankly comment on the program and we basically learn that their lives will continue as is. I wish there were more of these moments because so much of Psycho's substance lies in the way that these men are seen as products of the society that was created under Reagan's America. Bateman's soul is one that is consumed by greed and it seems that he has been given a second chance by film's end. Whether he will take this exit or continue this masquerade is open to interpretation and perhaps dependent on whatever political shift should sway the nation.",5,"Dark Satire, rather than Horror flick... a gem.",978393600,"01 2, 2001",2001,3949,"['Patrick', 'Bateman', 'yuppie', 'serial', 'killer', 'du', 'jour', 'created', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'obsessed', 'things', 'superficial', 'Ellis', 'written', 'world', 'full', 'super-attractive', 'young', 'men', 'secret', 'killer', 'ways', 'protagonist', 'masochistic', 'behavior', 'only', 'occasionally', 'step', 'back', 'comment', 'behavior', 'larger', 'scale', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'intended', 'be', 'metaphor', 'Reaganism', 'kill', 'somehow', 'message', 'muddled', 'non-stop', 'name-dropping', 'unending', 'detail', 'Ellis', 'Bateman', 'ritualistic', 'killings.Mary', 'Harron', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'one-ups', 'Ellis', 'just', 'department', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'fact', 'many', 'designers', 'did', 'not', 'grant', 'Harron', 'permission', 'use', 'names', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Godsend', 'Harron', 'focus', 'more', 'relevant', 'nuances', 'character', 'Harron', 'brilliantly', 'Bateman', 'attraction', 'things', 'narcissistic', 'scene', 'where', 'daily', 'facial', 'rejuvenating', 'process', 'standing', 'front', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'combine', 'moment', 'Bateman', 'non-stop', 'exercise', 'regime', 'desire', 'dine', 'fanciest', 'restaurants', 'have', 'Bateman', 'concerned', 'nothing', 'more', 'own', 'beautification.The', 'infamous', 'threesome', 'scene', 'slapped', 'film', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'great', 'one', 'Bateman', 'played', 'astonishing', 'madness', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'completely', 'detached', 'act', 'sex', 'Much', 'Ellis', 'portrait', 'Bateman', 'man', 'more', 'concerned', 'performance', 'actual', 'act', 'sex', 'having', 'sex', 'women', 'mirror', 'making', 'love', 'enjoying', 'muscular', 'body', 'masochistically', 'women.Although', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'completely', 'loathsome', 'soul', 'Harron', 'appropriately', 'certain', 'human', 'element', 'psycho', 'killer', 'Even', 'Bateman', 'voice-over', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'get', 'sense', 'seeking', 'sort', 'salvation', 'world', 'created', 'bringing', 'secretary', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'apartment', 'leave', 'telling', ""n't"", 'might', 'do', 'something', 'horrible', 'her.Bateman', 'sadistic', 'ways', 'are', 'certainly', 'product', 'twisted', 'childhood', 'adult', 'experiences', 'Harron', 'not', 'choose', 'focus', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'moment', 'where', 'Bateman', 'dinner-date', 'being', 'late', 'saying', 'product', 'divorce', 'only', 'glimpse', 'get', 'character', 'pre-killer', 'days', 'Harron', 'flippantly', 'teasing', 'comment', 'knowing', 'are', 'itching', 'sort', 'Freudian', 'psychoanalysis', 'character.The', 'gore', 'significantly', 'lesser', 'scale', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'Aside', 'one', 'astonishingly', 'executed', 'sequence', 'where', 'prostitute', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'Patrick', 'down', 'stairs', 'killings', 'film', 'are', 'handled', 'comedic', 'disturbing', 'way', 'women', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'characterization', 'appropriate', 'thing', 'when', 'consider', 'film', 'shot', 'Bateman', 'eyes', 'man', 'little', 'concerned', 'motivations', 'victims.There', 'moment', 'end', 'Psycho', 'wonderful', 'finale', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'watching', 'presidential', 'address', 'Reagan', 'blankly', 'comment', 'program', 'basically', 'learn', 'lives', 'will', 'continue', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'moments', 'so', 'much', 'Psycho', 'substance', 'way', 'men', 'are', 'seen', 'products', 'society', 'was', 'created', 'Reagan', 'America', 'Bateman', 'soul', 'one', 'consumed', 'greed', 'been', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'film', 'end', 'will', 'take', 'exit', 'continue', 'masquerade', 'open', 'interpretation', 'perhaps', 'dependent', 'political', 'shift', 'should', 'sway', 'nation']",American Psycho VHS

First, Christian Bale's acting is superb. Some of the best acting i've seen in a while as a matter of fact. Second, the movie is highly entertaining with not one part of it being boring. As soon as it starts, you're sucked into the movie's reality and you really don't want to 'get out', for want of a better term. And finally, Three, i'm amazed at why it's taken me so long to get around to seeing this. I always thought it was just another ""Slasher"" kind of film. I didn't really have any motivation for seeing it until now, and it's really paid off.Like i said, as soon as this movie starts, you're sucked into it's reality. It's set in 1987, and it's such a movie in that you actually do start to wonder if it WAS made in 1987. The hairstyles, the clothes, the phones, the cars..everything makes it look like the late 80's. And of course, Cocaine is the drug of choice, and Hookers are used and abused frequently by all the Yuppies in town as well. And in the middle of all that, we have our main character Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale. As i said, the acting is extremely good. Bale is pretty much THE perfect choice for the role.One of the highlights of the movie, and i stress the ""One of.."" part of that, is the ending. I really don't know how to explain it without giving away the ending, but i must say the ending is truly awesome. This movie is dark, violent and altogether very cold. It does have that cold atmosphere about it. After watching this movie too, i really want to check out the book. I've heard it's pretty much word-for-word and almost exactly the same, except more violent, but i still think it'd be very interesting. Also, that's not to say this movie isn't 'violent' either, because it really is in some parts. There is one part where Christian Bale is running naked down the hallway, chainsaw in hand, covered in blood, trying to murder a Hooker. So it is pretty violent in some parts, and basically the whole movie has a dark and violent atmosphere behind it.If you enjoyed Donnie Darko, Fight Club or even The Shining, you will no doubt enjoy this great movie. It won't leave you feeling uplifted and happy, but nor should it. It's not that type of movie and isn't trying to be, obviously. In a word it's unsettling, as the title of my review says.

72006,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0783243499,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","What's this guy's problem? I'd be in heaven. Poor, disillusioned Patrick just needs to buy a house in the country, marry-up Reese, and lay down the law about being true to her man. And follow that advice himself by being loyal in return. Man, I'd be set! I mean, he'd be set. Anyways, where was I? Ah, American Psycho. Nothing short of mesmerizing. Patrick Bateman (our old friend, Christian Bale, from two personal favorites of mine, Newsies and Little Women) is a yuppie in the mid 1980's, extremely rich, and extremely messed up. He feels that ""Patrick Bateman"" isn't a real person, just an idea, a mask he wears. This is probably partly due to the fact that all the yuppies he works and plays with are so much alike, and so self-absorbed, that they can't even keep each other's names straight. Maybe that's what angers him so much that all he really thinks about is killing, dismembering, and even eating his victims. Oh, and '80's music, he's big on '80's music. You know, Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, the best of the '80's at least. As a matter of fact, he loves playing '80's CD's and talking about '80's music trivia as he performs his executions and murders. This is not altogether unnecessary, as it does help to lighten the mood during the violent scenes.Basically, the film takes us through a particularly difficult time in Patrick's life, when his obsession with killing begins to interfere with his facade of just another young hot shot business man. Competition is the way of life in Patrick's world, and he's beginning to feel the urge to use his hobby in the workplace as an effective tool of business. To put it simply, Patrick is losing control. The pressures at work, his frustration with his Yuppie girlfriend (Witherspoon), his hatred of his friends, and the inquisitions from a certain Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), are causing him to be careless and deadly. Simultaneously, he is having to deal with the tiny bit of natural sympathy that still exists within him, mainly for his innocent and naive young secretary who has a serious crush on him. Things keep getting worse and worse for Patrick, so much that he somehow becomes the hero of the picture. No doubt, despite the fact that he's obviously nuts, he really becomes a very sympathetic and likeable character. I'm guessing that this is because everyone else in the film is just such a jerk. Of course, this disturbing feeling of sympathy for a psycho was purely intentional by the filmmakers, but it's fascinating nonetheless. The climax of the film is even more disturbing, and the resolution, downright confusing, but in a fantastic way. American Psycho is one of the best movies out there right now.

It is grusome, horrible and gory, but at the same time oddly cute at times.  It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.Patrick Bateman is the yuppie scum we grew to hate: arrogant, materialistic, and self serving.  Yet, at the same time while being psychotic, he longs for substance.  He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.  Instead he becomes obsessed with the most trivial of insignifigant things (ex. designer clothes), going so far as to obsess over the subtle watermarks on a business card.  His friends and aquaintance are so shallow they confuse him with someone else and he's happy to play into it.  Why shouldn't he?  No one knows the difference or takes the time out to realize it.  Maybe this is more a comment on our culture despite the yuppie / 80s backdrop.  People really are not all that concerned with more than themselves.  Perhaps none of us have true friends, it's all an illusion.  I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.One of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.  While she is just as shallow and rude as the others, she has an odd hold over him that no one else seems to.  He doesn't exactly follow her orders, but she seems to have almost a mothering effect on him.  Patrick seems almost afraid of her, and when he finally ends the relationship he almost apologizes when he takes joy in hurting others.Many people were angry about the sex scenes.  If anything they were just ridiculous (how about that scene of him flexing and posturing before the mirror with those two hookers while playing Phil Collins songs?!).

If a book was bad enough to earn an R rating then I was wondering  how could they go about screening it. But it turns out that they did a  rather good job. The movie still has the same story and a lot of the  bizarre sex and voilence, but it is not nearly as graphic as the book is.  This does not, however let the movie down in any way.

The violence  is toned-down to a point where it's almost absent ('Very Bad Things' was  much nastier), and the obsessive detail of the book is left in the  exquisitely-detailed recreation of the late-80s. In fact, the lack of  violence hurts the film, in a way - Christian Bale's version of Bateman  seems like too much of an idiot to be the inventive, invulnerable amoralist  of his literary equivalent (and the physical resemblance to Chris Morris is  striking).

In it we have Christian Bale as `psycho' of the title Patrick Bateman, spurred into action through a boring 80's lifestyle of business and appearances.  By focusing on middle-class society's little nuances, this movie manages to show just how complacent society has become, with Bale's lifestyle of a perfectly astute businessman masking his other life as a murderer who hires prostitutes up to his trendy flat.The performances are all good but it is Bale who impresses the most as he calmly murders a colleague yet becomes pent-up with rage when someone has a more expensive-looking business card than his own.  The audience sits back and watches as the beautiful ensemble cast (including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Jared Leto) are lured or skewered by Bateman.  This is black comedy at its very blackest, forcing its audience into nervous titters as Bateman moonwalks behind one of his victims, wielding an axe, or prepares for a murder whilst listening to Whitney Houston.It's not only a darkly humorous piece but it also says a lot about society today, despite being set two decades ago.

My reading the book prepared me for the disturbing images I would ultimately see on the screen. Christian Bale did an excellent job of portraying the monstrous yet calm Patrick Bateman in a story that takes place in the 1980s.The story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City. He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him - he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon. However, what these people don't know is that under that charming exterior lies a vicious killer who must satisfy his need to kill whenever the mood strikes. Even though he does possess the traits of a killer, there are also some lighter scenes in the movie. The scene where Patrick and his co-workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face. It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life-threatening to these men. Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing.

72024,A363QRXP83K8ZE,0783243499,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[1, 2]","American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.  But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about ""men behaving badly"" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ...This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.",4,Pulling off the almost impossible,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3418,"['American', 'Psycho', 'book', 'easy', 'fit', 'screen', 'terms', 'visuals', 'what', 'difficult', 'transfer', 'film', 'actual', 'excess', 'style', 'instance', 'book', 'can', 'note', 'actual', 'style', 'book', 'structured', 'are', 'entire', 'chapters', 'style', ""'re"", 'done', 'placement', ""'re"", 'given', 'tell', 'reader', 'are', 'non-essential', 'rants', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'News', 'run', '5-6', 'pages', 'book', 'are', 'best', 'skipped', 'go', 'find', 'great', 'lines', 'film', 'difficult', 'do', 'would', 'equate', '5', 'more', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'bored', 'audience.Anyway', 'film', 'thought', 'American', 'Psycho', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'adaptation', 'anyone', 'could', 'hope', ""'re"", 'fan', 'book', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'female', 'director', 'making', 'ultimate', 'movie', 'men', 'behaving', 'badly', 'featurette', 'two', 'things', 'film', 'real', 'treat', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'funny', 'witty', 'enough', 'just', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'Plenty', 'people', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'book', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'once', 'see', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'where', 'start', 'say', 'owe', 'see', 'excellent', 'independent', 'film', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'amazing', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'accent', 'great', 'facial', 'expressions', 'priceless', 'look', 'when', 'examining', 'rival', 'business', 'card', 'whole', 'play', 'character', 'everyone', 'what', 'Ellis', 'was', 'doing', 'book', 'Everyone', 'may', 'hear', 'notoriety', 'book', 'end', 'American', 'Psycho', 'was', 'blackest', 'comedies', 'forcing', 'reader', 'try', 'laugh', 'moments', 'are', 'interspersed', 'most', 'disturbing', 'passages', ""'ve"", 'read', 'long', 'time.The', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'incredible', 'difficult', 'job', 'cutting', 'book', 'down', 'filmable', 'size', 'great', 'job', 'picking', 'scenes', 'book', 'screen', 'meanwhile', 'leaving', 'out', 'entire', 'sections', 'characters', 'Bethanie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'not', 'compromising', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'be', '3', 'hour', 'movie', 'instead', '100', 'minutes', 'feels', 'just', 'right.Christian', 'Bale', 'so', 'commanding', 'Bateman', 'real', 'face', 'narrator', 'book', 'film', 'even', 'violence', 'watching', 'scenes', 'book', 'played', 'off', 'take', 'humerous', 'tone', 'black', 'white', 'page', 'was', 'hiding', 'well', 'instance', 'murder', 'Al', 'bum', 'funny', 'when', 'Bateman', 'saying', 'lines', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'drama', 'very', 'vicious', 'satire', 'elements', 'stays', 'smart.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'not-Hollywood', 'director', 'making', 'compromising', 'more', 'book', 'favor', 'personal', 'style.Interesting', 'note', 'reason', 'UK', 'region', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'here', '6', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'American', 'DVD', 'number', 'nice', 'extras', 'why', 'would', 'leave', 'off', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'least', '2', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'nicely', 'film', 'other', 'bits', 'are', 'funny', 'well', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'anyone', 'little', 'dark', 'side', 'matter', 'how', 'little', 'funny', 'visually', 'provoking', 'enough', 'many', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'small', 'production', 'appreciate', 'cruel', 'satire', 'blackest', 'humor']",American Psycho VHS

Would this have been the same movie if it was done by a man? It probably wouldn't. And that's a good thing.There's black comedy, satire and gore in equal proportions. The way violence is shown to - or kept from - the viewer reminded me of ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the way that the camera slightly deviates from the target forcing us to imagine exactly what's happening right there. Andrezj Sekula cinematography struck me as particularly good as it perfectly resembles that 80s look and feel in a picture that's been released in 2000.And then there's a brilliant performance by Christian Bale, one of the best serial killer impersonations I've ever seen and Bale's best acting ever if it wasn't for stuff like ""The Machinist"" which would come later in his career. What's really difficult about doing a serial killer role is not exactly the killings but rather, and very much so in this case, the downward spiral of their mind. Bateman is a victim of the mid to late 80s lust in America, Wall Street in particular, like all of his colleagues. He's just gone a little bit overboard (this is obviously an understatement but you get my point). His insanity is in fact a by product of his lifestyle. There's this scene where Bateman, in a state of complete despair, admits all his crimes to his lawyer over the phone which is utterly brilliant and Bale nails it.The final stages of the film are kind of open, lending themselves to different interpretations and personally I prefer having to rethink the whole film under a different light after I've seen it.",4,Well done satire,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1671,"['story', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'serial', 'killer', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', '1991', 'novel', 'seen', 'eyes', 'woman', 'director', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'man', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing.There', 'black', 'comedy', 'satire', 'gore', 'equal', 'proportions', 'way', 'violence', 'shown', 'kept', 'viewer', 'reminded', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'way', 'camera', 'slightly', 'target', 'forcing', 'imagine', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'right', 'there', 'Andrezj', 'Sekula', 'cinematography', 'struck', 'particularly', 'good', 'perfectly', '80s', 'look', 'feel', 'picture', 'been', 'released', '2000.And', 'then', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'one', 'best', 'serial', 'killer', 'impersonations', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Bale', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'stuff', 'Machinist', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'career', 'What', 'really', 'difficult', 'doing', 'serial', 'killer', 'role', 'not', 'exactly', 'killings', 'rather', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'case', 'downward', 'spiral', 'mind', 'Bateman', 'victim', 'mid', 'late', '80s', 'lust', 'America', 'Wall', 'Street', 'particular', 'colleagues', 'just', 'gone', 'little', 'bit', 'overboard', 'obviously', 'understatement', 'get', 'point', 'insanity', 'fact', 'product', 'lifestyle', 'scene', 'where', 'Bateman', 'state', 'complete', 'despair', 'crimes', 'lawyer', 'phone', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'Bale', 'it.The', 'final', 'stages', 'film', 'are', 'kind', 'open', 'lending', 'different', 'interpretations', 'personally', 'prefer', 'having', 'rethink', 'whole', 'film', 'different', 'light', ""'ve"", 'seen']",American Psycho VHS

I think the fact that the director was a woman gave it a perspective that a male director, no matter how talented, could not have nailed. Instead of focussing on the acts themselves, which the book was rumored to do, it focusses rather on the arrogance and charm of the person committing those acts. The murders are in the background, not the foreground of the story. The movie may also have ran the risk of glorifying Patrick Bateman, but instead the audience is encouraged to find him shallow, wittless, and soulless. This also makes for very hilarious scenes of awkward encounters, botched murders, sloppy killing sprees, and an attempt at feeding a cat to an ATM (can you say ""index finger in society's eyeball?"").

72041,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0783243499,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 5]","American Psycho (Mary Herron, 2000)Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho is the nadir of the eighties novel; it reads, roughly, like a three hundred page Sharper Image catalog, an endless listing of brand names and prices with nothing even remotely resembling a soul. When the film was released, the critics quickly came to the same conclusion about it. After a few months, however, better reviews of the film began to surface fromindependent critics and the like, calling it abrilliant satire, wickedly funny, you know, that sort of thing. So I had to rent it. My constant repeating thought was &quot;it can't be as bad as the book.&quot;I was right. That's not saying much.Christian Bale (who's going to be typecast as a sleazebag if he doesn't watch out) plays Patrick Bateman, a man whose obsession with fitting in to the fast-moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder.Herron, who's certainly no stranger to ultraviolence (she's directed episodes of Homicide and Oz, as well as the cult hit I Shot Andy Warhol), does manage to capture a certain beauty to Bateman's homicidal rage; there's a particular scene where Bateman is chasing a prostitute (Cara Seymour) down a hallway with a chainsaw that's almost hypnotic. Where the movie fails is in the spaces between. It's almost as if Ellis wrote the novel on a bet-- &quot;can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?&quot; The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.This makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up-and-comer Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, a woman who stands out as the true beauty in a shallow world of glamour; Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) as Paul Allen, a business partner of Bateman's; Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's oblivious, apoiled fiancee; and Willem Dafoe, as usual, taking a minor role (a homicide detective) and turning it into something palpably creepy.When all is said and done, there's just not enough good here to counteract the horrid. * 1/2",2,Yet another example of wasted potential.,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,2255,"['American', 'Psycho', 'Mary', 'Herron', '2000', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'American', 'Psycho', 'nadir', 'eighties', 'novel', 'roughly', 'three', 'hundred', 'page', 'Sharper', 'Image', 'catalog', 'endless', 'listing', 'brand', 'names', 'prices', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'soul', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'critics', 'quickly', 'came', 'same', 'conclusion', 'few', 'months', 'however', 'better', 'reviews', 'film', 'began', 'surface', 'fromindependent', 'critics', 'like', 'calling', 'abrilliant', 'satire', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'had', 'rent', 'My', 'constant', 'repeating', 'thought', 'was', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'book.', 'quot', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'saying', 'much.Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'typecast', 'sleazebag', ""n't"", 'watch', 'out', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'man', 'obsession', 'fitting', 'fast-moving', 'upperclass', 'Wall', 'Street', 'society', 'father', 'obsession', 'brand', 'names', 'things', 'daily', 'routine', 'unstoppable', 'compulsion', 'murder.Herron', 'who', 'certainly', 'no', 'stranger', 'ultraviolence', 'directed', 'episodes', 'Homicide', 'Oz', 'as', 'well', 'cult', 'hit', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'manage', 'capture', 'certain', 'beauty', 'Bateman', 'homicidal', 'rage', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Bateman', 'chasing', 'prostitute', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'down', 'hallway', 'chainsaw', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'Where', 'movie', 'spaces', 'almost', 'Ellis', 'wrote', 'novel', 'bet', 'quot', 'can', 'take', 'perfectly', 'shallow', 'character', 'center', 'whole', 'book', 'quot', 'result', 'book', 'film', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'fun', 'experience.This', 'more', 'painful', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'surface', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'up-and-comer', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Bateman', 'secretary', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'true', 'beauty', 'shallow', 'world', 'glamour', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'business', 'partner', 'Bateman', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Bateman', 'oblivious', 'apoiled', 'fiancee', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'usual', 'taking', 'minor', 'role', 'homicide', 'detective', 'turning', 'something', 'palpably', 'creepy.When', 'said', 'done', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'here', 'counteract', 'horrid', '1/2']",American Psycho VHS

72045,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0783243499,Roland E. Zwick,"[219, 243]","No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's ""American Psycho"" is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message.Set in the mid-1980's, ""American Psycho"" casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as ""yuppies.""  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything - stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fianc&eacute;, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right ""stuff"" to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims - a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.  Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world.Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like ""In the Company of Men,"" we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are.  Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.To reiterate, ""American Psycho"" may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards.",4,sharp satire of yuppies,972691200,"10 28, 2000",2000,3876,"['doubt', 'Mary', 'Harrion', 'American', 'Psycho', 'definitely', 'not', 'taste', 'audience', 'demographic', 'good', 'news', 'perhaps', 'film', 'nowhere', 'near', 'gruesome', 'gory', 'subject', 'matter', 'controversial', 'nature', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'fact', 'tone', 'ironic', 'comic', 'detachment', 'de-emphasize', 'more', 'sordid', 'aspects', 'material', 'instead', 'highlight', 'film', 'bitingly', 'satiric', 'message.Set', 'mid-1980', 'American', 'Psycho', 'scathing', 'eye', 'then-brand', 'new', 'up-and-coming', 'group', '20-something', 'executives', 'known', 'yuppies', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'psycho', 'title', 'man', 'who', 'literally', 'have', 'everything', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks', 'fantastic', 'physique', 'beautiful', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'diploma', 'Harvard', 'successful', 'career', 'Wall', 'Street', 'executive', 'alone', 'young', 'men', 'whom', 'Patrick', 'flatly', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'literally', 'empty-suit', 'perfectly', 'maintained', 'outer', 'appearance', 'seemingly', 'well-ordered', 'social', 'routine', 'empty', 'superficial', 'personal', 'relationships', 'merely', 'mask', 'moral', 'emptiness', 'core', 'soul', 'Much', 'complexity', 'Patrick', 'character', 'fact', 'paradoxically', 'be', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'conforming', 'values', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'strangely', 'conscious', 'unreality', 'meaninglessness', 'Thus', 'see', 'becoming', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'unglued', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'reserve', 'proper', 'table', 'posh', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'one', 'corporate', 'buddies', 'more', 'impressive', 'looking', 'business', 'card', 'Much', 'Patrick', 'madness', 'roots', 'kind', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'paranoia', 'modern', 'insistence', 'life', 'should', 'indeed', 'can', 'be', 'converted', 'perfect', 'problem-free', 'existence', 'one', 'just', 'enough', 'money', 'sufficient', 'amount', 'right', 'stuff', 'make', 'way', 'Frankly', 'admitting', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'Patrick', 'thereby', 'free', 'channel', 'madness', 'ultimate', 'anti-social', 'taboo-shattering', 'shape', 'form', 'serial', 'killing', 'Thus', 'days', 'turn', 'nights', 'Patrick', 'rack', 'up', 'victims', 'potential', 'victims', 'homeless', 'man', 'assorted', 'prostitutes', 'ex-girlfriend', 'unctuous', 'business', 'associate', 'even', 'policemen', 'who', 'get', 'wise', 'activities', 'later', 'film.Luckily', 'squeamish', 'far', 'more', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'devoted', 'comic', 'rather', 'thriller', 'mode', 'brittle', 'dryly', 'humorous', 'Mary', 'Harrion/Guinevere', 'Turner', 'screenplay', 'corporate', 'world', 'milieu', 'twisted', 'rantings', 'values-free', 'mind', 'black', 'comedy', 'potential', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'remarkable', 'subtlety', 'touchy', 'role', 'managing', 'seem', 'coolly', 'alluring', 'chillingly', 'detached', 'touchingly', 'pathetic', 'wryly', 'amusing', 'same', 'time', 'Special', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'stark', 'almost', 'antiseptic', 'look', 'filmmakers', 'achieve', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'design', 'look', 'visual', 'terms', 'moral', 'emotional', 'emptiness', 'characters', 'world.Much', 'was', 'made', 'anti-woman', 'tone', 'novel', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'director', 'are', 'women', 'movie', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'aspect', 'quite', 'bit', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'Company', 'Men', 'find', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'appalled', 'sadly', 'bemused', 'vehemently', 'anti-women', 'comments', 'uttered', 'Patrick', 'cronies', 'see', 'what', 'shallow', 'losers', 'men', 'really', 'are', 'Harrion', 'Turner', 'obviously', 'know', 'whereof', 'speak.To', 'reiterate', 'American', 'Psycho', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'cinematic', 'tea', 'looking', 'sharp', 'little', 'satire', 'modern', 'American', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'definite', 'rewards']",American Psycho VHS

72051,A2HCABDKJ5T24K,0783243499,"Ryan M Clark ""Film Buff""","[2, 4]","Morals by the wayside with a grandiose explosion of debauchery and mayhem can only describe the film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' shocking novel ""American Psycho"". Christian Bale plays the title role of troubled stockbroker Patrick Bateman, who has worked his way to the top of his stock brokerage with little more than his wealthy father's influence. He lives a predictable life: eating at the hotspots, going to the new clubs, dating beautiful women, and paying $15 for vodka tonics on a regular basis.From the outset of the film we can tell that Patrick's habits are obsessive (to say the least) and his taste in entertainment is bordering on sadistic. After he loses complete interest in work, he begins to manifest elements of the horror movies he watches constantly into his everyday life: he goes on a murder spree. It starts rather benignly, then gets sickeningly more gruesome as the movie progresses. We see him drift slowly into an oblivion of insanity, at which point the viewer begins to question what is real and what is imagined.Christian Bale's tour de force as Ellis' hated characterBale's performance as Patrick Bateman is perhaps one of the best dramatic roles to come from any actor in recent years. His simulation of insanity is easily believable by the viewer: he is a normal, everyday guy that we can identify with. This is what makes it especially shocking to the viewer: society has put Patrick in a box where he can do nothing but succeed, and yet he inexplicably decides to pursue a life as a deranged serial killer almost just to see if he can do it. The label put on him is so effective that when he confesses all his crimes to his lawyer in a moment of clarity, his lawyer doesn't even believe him. His journey begins testing the waters of murder, but ultimately he ends up swimming in an ocean of blood.A controversial ending reminiscent of the book is what truly made this movie for me, but even true fans of Ellis' work are split on if its presence was effective. The aforementioned phone call to his lawyer leads even Patrick to speculate if his insanity has caused him to imagine all of the crimes he has committed, or if they are indeed real. With the amount of live action and murder on screen in the movie, it is plainly obvious that he did not imagine any of this at all. As for the character being insane: there's no question of that. He is as crazy as they come, and Bale makes us believe it.",5,"I could tell you Halberstram, but then I'd have to kill you....",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2437,"['Morals', 'wayside', 'grandiose', 'explosion', 'debauchery', 'mayhem', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'shocking', 'novel', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'title', 'role', 'troubled', 'stockbroker', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'top', 'stock', 'brokerage', 'little', 'more', 'wealthy', 'father', 'influence', 'predictable', 'life', 'eating', 'hotspots', 'going', 'new', 'clubs', 'dating', 'beautiful', 'women', 'paying', '15', 'vodka', 'tonics', 'regular', 'outset', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'Patrick', 'habits', 'are', 'obsessive', 'say', 'least', 'taste', 'entertainment', 'bordering', 'sadistic', 'complete', 'interest', 'work', 'manifest', 'elements', 'horror', 'movies', 'constantly', 'everyday', 'life', 'murder', 'spree', 'rather', 'benignly', 'then', 'sickeningly', 'more', 'gruesome', 'movie', 'see', 'drift', 'slowly', 'oblivion', 'insanity', 'point', 'viewer', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagined.Christian', 'Bale', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Ellis', 'hated', 'characterBale', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'come', 'actor', 'recent', 'years', 'simulation', 'insanity', 'easily', 'believable', 'viewer', 'normal', 'everyday', 'guy', 'can', 'identify', 'especially', 'shocking', 'viewer', 'society', 'put', 'Patrick', 'box', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'succeed', 'yet', 'inexplicably', 'pursue', 'life', 'deranged', 'serial', 'killer', 'almost', 'just', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'label', 'put', 'so', 'effective', 'when', 'crimes', 'lawyer', 'moment', 'clarity', 'lawyer', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'journey', 'testing', 'waters', 'murder', 'ultimately', 'up', 'swimming', 'ocean', 'blood.A', 'controversial', 'ending', 'reminiscent', 'book', 'what', 'truly', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'true', 'fans', 'Ellis', 'work', 'are', 'split', 'presence', 'was', 'effective', 'aforementioned', 'phone', 'call', 'lawyer', 'even', 'Patrick', 'speculate', 'insanity', 'caused', 'imagine', 'crimes', 'committed', 'are', 'indeed', 'real', 'amount', 'live', 'action', 'murder', 'screen', 'movie', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'did', 'not', 'imagine', 'character', 'being', 'insane', 'question', 'as', 'crazy', 'come', 'Bale', 'believe']",American Psycho VHS

72056,A2G935GMRAUIRW,0783243499,Sandy McLendon,"[3, 4]","When I read Bret Easton Ellis'&quot;American Psycho&quot;, my reactions boiled down to, (A) &quot;This is the most distasteful thing I've ever read.&quot; and (B) &quot;Nobody's ever gonna film THIS.&quot;  After seeing the film version on the advice of a trusted friend, I can only say I'm still right about (A), but I was totally wrong about (B).  Mary Harron has done what I thought impossible- she has not only filmed &quot;American Psycho&quot;, she has made it a much better story than it ever was in print.  Her basic technique is diabolically simple; her script demolishes the line between what protagonist Patrick Bateman actually does and what he fantasises doing.  Right from the start- in a witty title sequence that demonstrates that what you believe you're seeing is not necessarily what you think it is- Harron deliberately makes it unclear if Bateman's murders and rampages are real or in his head.  By film's end, the only thing that's clear is that Bateman could have done absolutely everything shown- or none of it- or some of it.  Chillingly, Bateman eventually realises he's so far gone that he himself does not know where the truth lies.  Not content to show Bateman as a psychopath, Harron mercilessly depicts the insanity of 1980's trendy New Yorkers.  Bateman is constantly telling people about the horrible acts he commits, or would like to, and no one listens.  Half the time Bateman is mistaken for someone else by people just too busy and self-centered to commit the simple, human act of caring enough to learn another person's name.  Is it any wonder he's the sickest of all possible puppies?Harron also strengthens the story by considerably restricting the levels of violence and misogyny that infest the book.  There are a few stretches that look extremely gory, but as with the shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot;, more is implied than shown.&quot;American Psycho&quot; benefits from a first-rate cast.  As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale is spot on the money as a preppie-turned-yuppie-turned-madman.  Reese Witherspoon is great as his fiancee who never realises who her man is, let alone WHAT her man is.  Chloe Sevigny does some very deft work as Bateman's secretary; the scene where she's invited to Bateman's apartment to be murdered- only to create a misunderstanding that saves her life- is a comic gem.  And there is a poignant turn by Cara Seymour as Christie, a hooker who meets a terrible fate.  Seymour has a remarkable likeness to Louise Brooks, and something of the same manner.  We will see more of her in years to come, I think.  Willem Dafoe is a treat as a detective who may or may not be on to Bateman- and, come to think of it, may or may not be real.See &quot;American Psycho&quot;.  Even if you hated the book, SEE IT.  It's a movie that has the intelligence to refrain from spelling everything out in TV-Movie-Of-The-Week fashion, and that alone should be recommendation enough.

The  only solid reason why it should be seen is for Christian Bale's performance  as Patrick Bateman. He captures the character's dual personalities; the  plastic-faced ladykiller and the chainsaw wielding maniac, and performs  with enough dynamic charisma to keep you diverted even when the film  misfires, which it does quite often. I was also quite impressed with film's  flamboyant visualization of upper-crust Manhattan during the 80's, watching  those nightclub scenes evoke strong memories of a time when excess and  campiness were in vogue. But even with these assets, &quot;American  Psycho&quot; suffers from a lack of visceral impact (the book, admittedly,  did have that) and a screenplay which can't seem to make up it's mind. Is  it a satire on yuppie materialism or a thriller about a man's increasing  bloodlust? If it was intended to be both, the results were confused,  especially during the final 20 minutes. There are indeed moments of insight  into the connection between then emptiness of society's values and Patrick  Bateman's absence of a soul (some of them funny, others disturbing) but the  film fails to get right inside the character's head.

Started off with some interest, was kicky in parts, especially the send-up of '80's nouvelle cuisine, the main character's job that involved no observable work, and the analysis of Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, and Whitney Houston pablum albums prior to murder and mayhem. It then spiraled into the ground, leaving no survivors. Imagine being forced to reread &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Among it's MANY weaknesses:1. Christian Bale's performance:  Contrary to most reviews, Christian Bale gives a completely predictable,unskilled performance. Anthony Hopkins and Kathleen Turner have popularized the sangfroid of the urbane, sophisticated serial killer, but Bale doesn't even approach them. There's nothing new here. Instead of chilling imperturbability, we're given monotone and wood. Monotone and wood. Monotone and wood. Then, trying to shock us with contrast, his outbursts of violence look like they were choreographed by Chuck Jones of Warner Bros fame. Beep beep. Even his breakdown scene falls flat. We're left with all the subtlety of his earlier Spielberg role (&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;) without the final mercy of an American bombing run.2. Annoying voice-over:  I'm more forgiving of this technique than most, but the criticism is well deserved here.  It's a poor substitute for tight story and competent direction. The main character's narcissism, the Wall Street milieu, his shallow and acquisitive colleagues, and his taste for insipid music should suffice to establish his soulless hollowness; there's no need for verbal cue cards. I suspect it's just the director's attempt to cut through the tedium of the movie and try to legitimize the film by evoking the novel.3. Reese Witherspoon:  Knowing what she's capable of, I can only conclude that she was hobbled by a bad script and sophomoric direction. Just a one-dimensional rehash of Madeline Kahn from Young Frankenstein and Gloria Upson from Auntie Mame. Talk about poo-poo undies.  4. Running gags:  How many times does the viewer have to see the same jokes about business card fonts and the inability to get dinner reservations?5. Dead-end plot devices:  A private eye played by Willem Defoe and a case of mistaken identity that go nowhere.

But it  is a daring movie, and its sordid potrayal of a whacko's life is certainly not recommended for the faint of heart. If you look beyond the gore (which is perhaps incidental to the plot) it's actually quite a piquant satirical take on a superficial, greed orientated society.The violence here is not gratuitous, at least to me it did not seem to be a convenient vehicle to make a voyeuristic film and shock audiences.  It surely is not a movie that investigates the innards of a psychotic killer's mind as some reviewers lament.Ostentatiously, the plot is about an eccentric Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) whose life revolves around the superficial trappings of materialism -- parties at swank bars, 1500 dollar Valentino suits, threesomes with professional women etc etc.  At first you are struck with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms, no one would associate with this wacko in real life.  Bateman's attempts to out-do his peers and be noticed and accepted get more and more pathologically brutal and heinous as the story progresses. But, despite his insanity, he's desperate to be caught. The confession at the end which draws total dismissal from his peers, just reiterates the kind of society we're in.We have a smattering of super-sardonic moments, the crescendo reached when we witness a business card comparison match between corporate peers. Or hotel reservations, the ultimate badge of Who's Who.The film has very subtle undertones if you are willing to read between the lines. For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air. It appears campy at first. It is violent, especially towards women. But it is not brainless. I'd say it is even well written.Take the time to actually watch this movie and think about it.

Although I admired the satirical boldness with which it equates the figurative and literal bloodlust/murderous impulses of those engendered by corporate culture and those experienced by serial killers (I'll let you figure out which is which), it's still not a easy film to sit through.  There are some excellent scenes however, such as the business cards scene and Patrick Bateman's hilariously unnerving analysis of music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, etc.  As a music fan, I find the implication that only the psychotic fringe would enjoy soporific Top 40 pop music completely delightful.  The problem with the film is that, like its source, it is all one note and it becomes irritating and uncomfortable after awhile.  And the film takes a easy way out near the end to make things more palatable to the audience (we'll henceforth refer to this type of travesty as the 'Fight Club' Syndrome).  However, this film is not without its share of brilliance, foremost of which is how Harron aims a scathing satire, even more so than the one directed at corporate culture, towards us, the people in the audience, for our desire to be entertained by violence and horror.

If you were disturbed by Natural Born Killers, then you ain't seen nothin'  yet.  I was in the theater laughing at things I felt horrible for laughing at.  I was laughing at a serial killer, and so was everyone else in the theater.  A guy sitting beside me said to me, &quot;I feel bad for laughing at this but I can't help it.&quot;  It was true, you couldn't. The movie was a social satire on the emphasis on materialism of the 80's.  It was about an investment banker, and his fellow collegues.  They would try to outdo each other in everything.  One of their favorite things to do was to compare business cards.  When someone would have a nicer card than Bateman, the main character, he would get one step closer to complete insanity.The first person he killed was a guy from work, whom he really didn't like.  He took him out for drinks, got him drunk, and then took him home.  When they got to Bateman's house, he had newspaper spread out all over the floor, with a chair with a sheet on it in the middle.  This is where the collegue sat down.  From that point you knew what was going to happen.  Bateman goes over to the CD player and puts on Huey Lewis and the News, Sports album, and then starts a running commentary on the band while Hip to be Square is playing, and while he is preparing to kill the guy.He goes into the kitchen, puts on a raincoat, and picks up an alluminum polished axe.  So shiny you could use it as a mirror for shaving.  He then walks into the room, and the guy asks him if that is a raincoat he is wearing.  He smiles and says yes.The guy then proceeds to ask him if that is an axe, and Bateman replies  pleasently, with a big grin on his face, &quot;Yes it is, and I'm going to kill you with it.&quot;He then proceeds to chop the guy up with Hip to Be Square playing in the background.  Then we all started laughing.  I don't know if it was because of the bizarness of the scene, or if it was genuinely funny to us.  Regardless, I think that everyone felt wrong about laughing at it.  He goes on to kill some other people in the same ways.  By that I mean that each murder has music playing in the background, and him giving the history of the performer.  It ends very strangely.I won't tell you how, because I recommend you watch it, if you are an adult, that isn't on the verge of going psychotic, because if you are, this one may be more of a documentary, than a work of fiction for you.THE GOODChristian Bale did an excellent job of playing this Bateman guy.  He really acted psychotic.  The story was interesting.  It was a story of a cry for help, and the way people who only care about status don't care about anything else.THE BADThat a movie can make you laugh at this kind of stuff.  I'm not sure if it is right to find this sort of thing humorus, but in the situation of this movie, I think the filmakers were trying to show the absurdity of the status issue.THE BOTTOM LINELike I said, definitely not for kids, but I reccommend you see it if you can handle it.

72085,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,0783243499,The Groove,"[65, 70]","Whether we know it or not, many of us have co-workers who are just like Patrick Bateman.  On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.  But on the inside lurks a fragmented soul ready to snap at any given moment.  Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce & Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.  In adapting the controversial and unpleasant book by Bret Easton Ellis, director Mary Harron purges much of the violence and misogyny that made the novel one of the most despised and misunderstood pieces of literature in the last 20 years.  What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.  This isn't a slasher film but rather a clever satire on the yuppie lifestyle of the late 1980s.  Speaking in a pitch-perfect American accent that recalls a game-show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.  His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.  Jared Leto is also good in his brief role as Paul Allen (in the book it's Paul Owen; why his name is changed in the film, I don't know); Chlo Sevigny also stands out as Patrick's timid assistant, and Reese Witherspoon shines as his clueless and self-absorbed fiancee.  This is the unedited version, which has a few additional flashes of nudity in one of the sex scenes.

What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, in a star-making turn) is a shallow Wall Street banker who lives an empty life. He lives and dies by a soda pop advertising slogan: Image Is Everything.  Set in the late 1980s, he is of a time when style reigns supreme over substance, obsessed with his physical beauty, getting into the trendiest restaurants, and nitpicking with his coworkers about who has the best business cards. Said co-workers (Jared Leto, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, and Josh Lucas), all have the same haircut and business suits, and for all intents and purposes are interchangeable. Bateman's sex life isn't exactly lacking, by any means. He's engaged to the shallow Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but cheats on her with her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis). He picks up a hooker off the street (Cara Seymour) and gets her in a threesome with another one of his friends, Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner, who co wrote the script).  His secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) also secretly lusts after him. Little does she know that he seems to have knocked off his best friend Paul Allen (Leto), a nameless homeless man, and countless members of the fairer sex, all by increasingly imaginative killing methods (staple gun, chainsaw, ATM machine; he tries it all). Eventually he finds he's being trailed by detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), who's investing Allen's disappearance but also seems to know a bit more about Patrick than he should.  From this moment on Bateman's inner demons are unleashed as he descends into an unending frenzy of paranoia and murder.Directed by Mary Harron (""I Shot Andy Warhol"", ""The Notorious Betty Page"") made a clever social satire film mixed brilliantly with horror. This film is loaded with dark humor, while Bale gives a dynamic performance. This independent film has high production values, a fine music score by John Cale and good looking cinematography by Andrzej Sekula (""Pulp Fiction"").  The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (i.e. the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pantheism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorization of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for misogyny here.  American Psycho"" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope, thus it could even be called a triumph.

That's the joke behind American Psycho, which follows a killer at large during the 1980s junk-bond boom. Bateman (Christian Bale) takes pathological pride in everything from his business card to his Huey Lewis CD collection, all the while plotting his next victim's vivisection.Parts of this film should not be controversial: sleek photography, a good score, great acting by the supporting cast, and deft directing. Two areas that ARE controversial: Bale's acting and the story itself. Black satire, including American Psycho, is a legitimate theme as are serial killers. Character studies can explore questions like Who am I? What is inside me? etc., as does this movie.Disturbing? Yes. Boring? With an ATM that instructs customers to ""Insert cat now"" and a severed head chilling in the fridge, there is nothing boring about the film. If you are bothered that the movie is violent and its star is one sick puppy, then you won't like Bales, but if it grips you despite its unpleasantness, you'll realize that Bales was superb.That the film is unrated may mislead you. The nudity and sex are not explicit, and its violence is less graphic than, say, that in many films.

Work for a Web design startup company with a CFO, CEO, COO or whatever who doesn't know anything and jsut thought that Web design would be a great way to supplement some of the losses from his telemarketing businesses, and you too will love the nastiness heaped upon yuppies by Brett Easton Ellis.A time capsule to when yuppies were considered cool, this young Republican does the things that yuppies do -- obsess over clothing, business cards, restaurant reservations while killing off homeless people and women on a weekly basis. And while Ivan Boesky and Milliken killed people by screwing up their paychecks or funding Contra rebels, Patrick Bateman takes a more hands-on approach.The funniest part of the movie is the music. Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and the rest of the superficial music is used for maximum effect with Bale giving long lectures on the importance of this music as if it really has any depth. The kill scene to the tune of Seu-seu-sudio cracks me up every time I think of it.At times the movie gets a little too long and repeats the same jokes (how many people have to be killed due to nicer business cards) but it moves along and you forgive it even if it might be about 20 minutes too long.Funny movie, violence is not too terrible, and it's a great way to laugh at yuppies.

I instantly decided that I would never watch the film, because it looked like a stupid slasher flick.  Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" and thought he was fantastic.  I looked up ""American Psycho"" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high.  So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try.I'm mighty glad that I did.""American Psycho"" is set in New York in 1987.  It revolves around Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), a very successful lawyer who may be getting married to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is having an affair with Courtney (Samantha Mathis), and is the object of his secretary's (Chloe Sevigny) affections.  But unbeknownst to his so-called ""friends"" and co-workers, Patrick is a killer who strikes almost at random.  And now a clever detective (Willem Dafoe) is investigating the murder of one of Patrick's victims.  Will Patrick get caught?The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' bestselling novel, which caused quite a controversy when it was first released.  ""American Psycho"" the film, like the book, is about two things: one, Patrick Bateman and the murders; and two, the self-absorbed society of the 80's.  Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun.Mary Harron's directing is wonderful.  During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Then there's the nighttime scenes - dark, grim, with a texture like charcoal.  Harron enhances the film immensely.Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is Christian Bale.  Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.  He BECOMES the character.  It blew me away.  He can be mean, angry, suave, and damn funny.  The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular.While I can't recommend this film to everybody, I would suggest that if you don't mind the occasional blood and are looking for a humorous film, pick this one up.

Showcasing himself as an almost perfect member of the human species possessed by intellect and a higher class superiority, he lives the part of the showman and many a person seems to buy into this presentation. Simply ask his secretary or the droves of females that flock about him, or the ones he approaches and finds thrown aback by the presentation of sophistication and charm within his demeanor. And what's not to like, really, about a member of the upper echelon of society with power, prowess, money, and a keen understanding of how the inner workings of the fraternally upper-class pecking order at his disposal? Besides, he is predisposed when it comes to echoing the sentimentality of success; owning the perfect ensemble, working out to fine-tune the garb underneath those wrappings, and taking great care to ward off blemishes that would others attempt to assail his skin and hair. On top of that he owns a seemingly grandiose apartment, a vast array of electronics that would cost a small fortune, and is fully equipped to feast on the entertainment of the time - especially in the realm of music. Going further, he also understands the ins and outs of wining and dining, partying and the prospective drug use that seems to follow closely in suit, and how to use the vacancies existing within others to benefit himself and further his own needs, and how to starkly mark his territory in the heat of the moment. And then there's his other hobbies...Based loosely on the trails and tribulations echoed throughout Bret Easton Ellis's book, American Psycho - and then only in the fact that some scenes are mimicked in an out-of-order fashion and that disfunctionalities of our main character, Mr. Bateman, are reproduced with stunning beauty -- this movie offers something different to people looking for more than mundaneness housed within murder. While its true that the level of violence that feeds Bateman between the books edges isn't showcased here and is instead left in commentary and implied snippets that sometime explode into the occasional outburst that tries to coat the screen, there are still windows looking into the beast inflicting Patrick's mentality. In fact, American Psycho is, in many ways, a breath of fresh air in a genre that otherwise suffers the platitudes of many and many a directorial mind, feeding its viewer images of a numbing world in which Bateman compares the quality of business cards, the needs to maintain his body, and indulges the monster within the illusion maintained by the man.Readers that approved of the character and his barbed wit will no doubt enjoy Bale's portrayal of the malicious mindset inflicting our upper-class killer, and might actually be surprised at the number of scenes they recognize from the book's pages. Even those who found the book disturbing should enjoy this softer, less graphic portrayal of Bateman's candor, seeing only bits and pieces of the man that is destined to be remembered as a social stamp dictating the excesses of the 80s for generations that weren't privy its influence firsthand.",5,Huey Lewis and the Reasons We Love Him,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,3234,"['Possessed', 'American', 'Dream', 'described', 'denizens', '1980s', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'potentially', 'powerful', 'part', 'everyone', 'want', 'Showcasing', 'almost', 'perfect', 'member', 'human', 'species', 'possessed', 'intellect', 'higher', 'class', 'superiority', 'part', 'showman', 'many', 'person', 'buy', 'presentation', 'Simply', 'ask', 'secretary', 'droves', 'females', 'flock', 'ones', 'thrown', 'aback', 'presentation', 'sophistication', 'charm', 'demeanor', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'really', 'member', 'upper', 'echelon', 'society', 'power', 'prowess', 'money', 'keen', 'understanding', 'how', 'inner', 'workings', 'fraternally', 'upper-class', 'pecking', 'order', 'disposal', 'Besides', 'predisposed', 'when', 'echoing', 'sentimentality', 'success', 'owning', 'perfect', 'ensemble', 'working', 'out', 'fine-tune', 'garb', 'underneath', 'wrappings', 'taking', 'great', 'care', 'ward', 'off', 'blemishes', 'would', 'others', 'attempt', 'assail', 'skin', 'hair', 'top', 'seemingly', 'grandiose', 'apartment', 'vast', 'array', 'electronics', 'would', 'cost', 'small', 'fortune', 'fully', 'equipped', 'feast', 'entertainment', 'time', 'especially', 'realm', 'music', 'Going', 'further', 'also', 'ins', 'outs', 'wining', 'dining', 'partying', 'prospective', 'drug', 'use', 'follow', 'closely', 'suit', 'how', 'use', 'vacancies', 'existing', 'others', 'benefit', 'further', 'own', 'needs', 'how', 'starkly', 'mark', 'territory', 'heat', 'moment', 'then', 'other', 'hobbies', 'Based', 'loosely', 'trails', 'tribulations', 'echoed', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'book', 'American', 'Psycho', 'then', 'only', 'fact', 'scenes', 'are', 'mimicked', 'out-of-order', 'fashion', 'disfunctionalities', 'main', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Bateman', 'are', 'reproduced', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'movie', 'something', 'different', 'people', 'looking', 'more', 'mundaneness', 'housed', 'murder', 'true', 'level', 'violence', 'Bateman', 'books', 'edges', ""n't"", 'showcased', 'here', 'instead', 'left', 'commentary', 'implied', 'snippets', 'sometime', 'explode', 'occasional', 'outburst', 'coat', 'screen', 'are', 'still', 'looking', 'beast', 'inflicting', 'Patrick', 'mentality', 'fact', 'American', 'Psycho', 'many', 'ways', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'platitudes', 'many', 'many', 'directorial', 'mind', 'feeding', 'viewer', 'images', 'numbing', 'world', 'Bateman', 'quality', 'business', 'cards', 'needs', 'maintain', 'body', 'monster', 'illusion', 'maintained', 'man.Readers', 'approved', 'character', 'barbed', 'wit', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'Bale', 'portrayal', 'malicious', 'mindset', 'inflicting', 'upper-class', 'killer', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'surprised', 'number', 'scenes', 'recognize', 'book', 'pages', 'Even', 'who', 'found', 'book', 'disturbing', 'should', 'enjoy', 'softer', 'less', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'Bateman', 'candor', 'seeing', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'man', 'destined', 'be', 'remembered', 'social', 'stamp', 'dictating', 'excesses', '80s', 'generations', 'were', ""n't"", 'privy', 'influence', 'firsthand']",American Psycho VHS

I know that this is difficult for some people to understand, but because American Psycho is a satire, a COMEDY, it is really key to understand what is being made fun of, what the filmmaker's primary target is, before trashing this and saying you are all upset and disgusted and don't understand and want to cry. Indeed, if you have been living in a bunker for the last 25 years, or were born after the year 2000, you may not be aware of the existence of such ""obscure"" cultural phenomena as: the 80's, New York, yuppieness in general, Wall Street, techno music, cocaine, big hair, prostitution, and exactly why Paul Allen's apartment makes Bateman's heart sink. But that is not the fault of American Psycho. Also, while this movie is obviously a gory and ""twisted"" movie (to use everyone's favorite word) it is ultimately kind of innocent because it's just a joke, it is a big gaffe. Really it is not fair that this movie has 3.5 stars on average; really, the vast majority of negative reviewers of this movie are so undeveloped in their basic comprehension of what is going on here - shocking as that is - that their reviews seem pretty meaningless. That's just my opinion.There are other elemets to the movie as a whole that the nay-sayers seem to pick up on. First and foremost is the actual ambiguity and even veracity of certain events. One interpretation of the film is that for whatever reason, Bateman has slipped into a psychological state where he himself is literally unaware of the events that are depicted in turn.Furthermore, for all of you who complain that this movie is ""sexist"" in that it [encourages] ""violence against women"" I would say that that is a rather shallow interpretation of a pretty brilliant movie that, if you see the bonus features on the DVD, was written and directed by several GLBT women, Guinevere Turner being one of them - one of the best writers around IMHO.",5,It's all about time and place,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2067,"['think', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'trashing', 'movie', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'absolutely', 'understanding', 'context', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'know', 'difficult', 'people', 'understand', 'American', 'Psycho', 'satire', 'COMEDY', 'really', 'key', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'primary', 'target', 'trashing', 'saying', 'are', 'upset', 'disgusted', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'want', 'cry', 'Indeed', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'bunker', 'last', '25', 'years', 'were', 'born', 'year', '2000', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'existence', 'such', 'obscure', 'cultural', 'phenomena', '80', 'New', 'York', 'yuppieness', 'general', 'Wall', 'Street', 'techno', 'music', 'cocaine', 'big', 'hair', 'prostitution', 'exactly', 'why', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'apartment', 'Bateman', 'heart', 'sink', 'not', 'fault', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Also', 'movie', 'obviously', 'gory', 'twisted', 'movie', 'use', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'word', 'ultimately', 'kind', 'innocent', 'just', 'joke', 'big', 'gaffe', 'Really', 'not', 'fair', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'average', 'really', 'vast', 'majority', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'undeveloped', 'basic', 'comprehension', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'shocking', 'reviews', 'seem', 'pretty', 'meaningless', 'just', 'are', 'other', 'elemets', 'movie', 'whole', 'nay-sayers', 'seem', 'pick', 'up', 'First', 'foremost', 'actual', 'ambiguity', 'even', 'veracity', 'certain', 'events', 'One', 'interpretation', 'film', 'reason', 'Bateman', 'slipped', 'psychological', 'state', 'where', 'literally', 'unaware', 'events', 'are', 'depicted', 'turn.Furthermore', 'who', 'complain', 'movie', 'sexist', '[', ']', 'violence', 'women', 'would', 'say', 'rather', 'shallow', 'interpretation', 'pretty', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'see', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'several', 'GLBT', 'women', 'Guinevere', 'Turner', 'being', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'writers', 'IMHO']",American Psycho VHS
72101,A1ZR196DOFT366,0783243499,Tyler Bond,"[0, 0]","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is just your normal New York investment-banking executive who kills people in his spare time. Bateman doesn&#8217;t have a real motive to his killings. He is self absorbed and only cares about his own well-being. He is a perfectionist. Everything has to be done routinely. Throughout the movie he struggles with inner conflicts, which ultimately leads to his insanity.Nothing is ever enough with Bateman. For example, there is a scene where all the executives are showing their name cards to one another, and Bateman starts to get jealous because their name cards are better than his. Even the smallest things could set him over. Bateman wants to be overall better than his coworkers. He wants the better hairstyle, the better clothing style, better name cards, better cars, better apartment, etc. Bateman has the idea he can eliminate some competition just by killing them off.This is one of Christian Bale&#8217;s best performances as an actor. He plays the psychopathic killer role extremely well. In fact there are even times where he is too believable. That is what distinguishes a good actor from a great one.A question you have to ask yourself, did Bateman really do these killings or was this all in his mind? This is a complex question because throughout the movie Bateman kills numerous people but the ending leaves it wide open to a possibility that he may not have killed anyone. This is a question you would have to ask yourself while watching this movie.I recommend this movie for anyone that wants to watch a psychological thriller.&#8220;Shaken, Not Stirred&#8221; Rating: 7.8/10Read more reviews at Bond's Movie Reviews on Facebook",4,Psychological Thriller,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1681,"['Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'just', 'normal', 'New', 'York', 'investment-banking', 'executive', 'who', 'people', 'spare', 'time', 'Bateman', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'real', 'motive', 'killings', 'self', 'absorbed', 'only', 'own', 'well-being', 'perfectionist', 'Everything', 'be', 'done', 'routinely', 'movie', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'ultimately', 'insanity.Nothing', 'ever', 'enough', 'Bateman', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'executives', 'are', 'showing', 'name', 'cards', 'one', 'Bateman', 'get', 'jealous', 'name', 'cards', 'are', 'better', 'Even', 'smallest', 'things', 'could', 'set', 'over', 'Bateman', 'be', 'overall', 'better', 'coworkers', 'better', 'hairstyle', 'better', 'clothing', 'style', 'better', 'name', 'cards', 'better', 'cars', 'better', 'apartment', 'etc', 'Bateman', 'idea', 'can', 'eliminate', 'competition', 'just', 'killing', 'one', 'Christian', 'Bale', '8217', 'best', 'performances', 'actor', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'fact', 'are', 'even', 'times', 'where', 'too', 'believable', 'what', 'good', 'actor', 'great', 'one.A', 'question', 'have', 'ask', 'did', 'Bateman', 'really', 'do', 'killings', 'was', 'mind', 'complex', 'question', 'movie', 'Bateman', 'numerous', 'people', 'ending', 'wide', 'open', 'possibility', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'killed', 'anyone', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'ask', 'watching', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'watch', 'psychological', 'thriller.', '8220', 'Shaken', 'Not', 'Stirred', '8221', 'Rating', '7.8/10Read', 'more', 'reviews', 'Bond', 'Movie', 'Reviews', 'Facebook']",American Psycho VHS

Compared to the other drivel and cliched movies that Hollywood released, expecting the audiences to unquestioningly choke down with their popcorn, &quot;American Psycho&quot; was a stand out and well-worth checking out, in my opinion.The main character, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), is the perfect example of the limitless clones that wondered through their selfish and uncaring lives in the American 1980s, devoid of any sense of common human morals and sense of decency. He works and lives Wallstreet, and what sets him apart from his other Harvard Vs. Yale &quot;friends&quot; is that he is completely and utterly insane. While his co-workers are stressing over deciding on which font setting looks best on their business cards and trying to get reservations at the stylish restaurant of the week, Bateman is struggling with his unquenchable lust to murder. The movie takes off from there, trying to show whether or not Patrick will go too far with his evil desires.What I really liked about &quot;American Psycho,&quot; besides the fact that it was better than 90% of the other films released in 2000, was that it didn't rely on gore and gratuitous violence to create an entertaining movie. The fact is that most of the violence is implied. Movies like &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; in the recent resurface in the teen horror flick genre have featured more violence and have left me more disturbed in its visual violence than in watching &quot;American Psycho.&quot;Another aspect is that each actor or actress works very well in his or her part, each showing the total insignificance of one person to the other in the corrupt business world of the 1980s. Some characters don't show up as much because they are just not important, and especially not meaningful to Patrick Bateman.The 1980s are captured very well in this film. From the discussions Bateman has about popular music acts of the time to sly references to sitcoms.This film works very well on three levels: first as a satire of the Yuppie Wallstreet era of the 1980s; second, as a murderous dark comedy; and third, as a surreal look into the mind of a very disturbed individual.If you like dark comedies much like &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Fight Club,&quot; then you'll probably enjoy &quot;American Psycho.&quot; However, if you don't like movies that push the limits to the mainstream, then you'll probably want to skip this one. This one is not for the kiddies (they won't understand) and not for the politically minded with strong left or right tendencies (they won't understand). It takes a weird sense of humor.",4,Don't Just Stare At It. Eat It.

Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best-seller lists, ""American Psycho"" isn't literature and isn't read today. But this film version is assured DVD shelf life because it largely replaces the gore with the satire that might have improved the book. It may have surprised author Bret Easton Ellis more than audiences that the movie emerged from all the controversy as a chilling, amusing examination of urban alienation. It's not the bloodbath that fans of Quentin Tarentino or George Romero might have expected.The movie does pay its thriller dues (and paid dearly for its NC-17 rating.) But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind. They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses. We see drops of blood splashing onto a white surface, then streams of blood, then - - - but wait, it's not blood at all but red syrup and rasberries garnishing plates in a Manhattan restaurant. They're being served to jaded young Wall Streeters who like to trade business cards, wisecracks and insider gossip.Suddenly, ""American Psycho"" is off and running in another direction, away from our expectations.Stay with it, even after I tell you that our young financier takes an axe to a colleague, has a fridge full of heads and a closet full of bodies, tapes his sexual threesomes, and that at one point he chases a blonde through his apartment building brandishing a chainsaw, naked and covered in blood.

That makes this movie a big slap in the face just like when stewie took over the world on family guy.

Dios,"[3, 4]","Although I was immediately smitten with the GORGEOUS Christian Bale (just to check out his perfect body is worth the price of the film!), the first time I watched this movie I was confused.  Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a sterotypical 1980's corporate yuppie, who suffers through each business day pretending to be someone he is NOT!  As you watch Bale move through the movie, it is obvious he is one of the great acting talents of today.  He scares the hell out of you as the apparent corporate vice president by day, psycho serial killer by night.  Oh, but IS he?  What a contrasting transformation Bale makes from his role in the wonderful movie &quot;Little Women&quot; as the suffering and love struck wanna be beau of &quot;Jo&quot;.  The second time I watched this film, I was left with the conclusion that the character of Patrick Bateman was not a serial killer at all, but a repressed business man venting his fantasies through the course of the film.  I reached this conclusion because his victims seemed to mysteriously disappear when he'd go back to get rid of the body, or were spotted by other corporate suits while traveling abroad.  Bateman's reaction to these &quot;spottings&quot; of his victims and the real estate agent's denial of any bodies lends some sense to my theory.  I love Reese Witherspoon, but she was miscast as Bateman's boring fiance, and Samantha Mathis' role as Bateman's lover wasn't much more exciting.  The movie has it's moments, though, and several times I caught myself sitting up straight and paying attention!  I will probably get emails telling me I am completely wrong, but believing Bateman's murdering and mayhem is only supposed to be in his mind made the movie more credible and believable to me.  It is DEFINITELY a &quot;keeper&quot; for the home theater library.  I bought the uncut version.

72111,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,0783243499,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 0]","This is how you get someone to watch a movie. I've been watching a lot more &#34;modern&#34; movies lately and when you compare them to this film. They just don't compare in the slightest.Let me tell you something, this is how you do a character development story. This is also how you throw the audience in for a ride and make them squirm in their seats.Let's get started:Straight off the bat, I don't know if I am particularly sensitive to this or if the movie just did it really well. But anything involving the prostitutes and women just made me so uncomfortable. I dreaded seeing what would happen to these women. I was at the end of my seat, praying and hoping that nothing would happen to his secretary. I felt bad for the prostitutes and was sad when they left his room bloodied and bruised. I felt sad for them because, they were just... doing what they were told for the money even though they didn't want to.This movie did an excellent job of building suspense and then giving you a satisfying conclusion to the suspense. Unlike the drek Paranormal Activities. When the movie builds up the tension and get you ready to be scared, frightened, or disturbed? It delivers in full impact. You're either going to breathe a sigh of relief or coil back in horror.The movie also did an excellent job of capturing what I guess is the theme of the novel (never read it myself). That everyone is so self absorbed with themselves, their money, their power, their things, their looks, which ultimately makes you feel disgusted with their society. In fact, these people are so abhorrent (kind of like the Kardashians) that you're actually happy when Bateman kills one of them.In fact, even though this movie came out in 2000, it still resonates with TODAY'S SOCIETY! We haven't learned how to be less materialistic yet and those same, self absorbed people, still exist and plague our culture and society.Although Bateman is a despicable character. He's definitely a villain that you can love to hate. Some of the stuff certainly got laugh out loud funny and ludicrous. But in the end, the film really delivers one heck of an experience.So why not rate it 5 stars?Well, for starters. I don't think this movie has replayability. Any movie that I'm happy to see over and over again gets a 5 stars. This is not one of them, only because once the surprises are gone there's really not much left.Also, a few people said that some of these parts were supposed to be satirical and funny. Although I get why people would see that, I didn't really find myself laughing along with the jokes. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I think I was too engrossed in being disgusted with their behavior to really laugh along with the jokes.And the ending. The ending wasn't really a let down, but at the same time it wasn't quite right. I got what the director was going for, it made sense and was executed way better than any other films I've seen. But at the same time, it just wasn't that satisfying. If you haven't seen the movie, I can't really say what happens, because the ending is designed so that you draw your own conclusions from it.Ultimately, the film was fascinating to watch and had me engrossed from the start. Definitely give it a watch if you've not seen it.",4,Never got to see this movie when it came out.

72112,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0783243499,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""American Psycho"" (2000) didn't look like a promising film. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of ""Deathwish."" In ""Deathwish"" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in ""American Psycho"" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.I also got the joke. ""American Psycho"" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).Thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera.I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but ""American Psycho"" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.GRADE: B-",3,"The opposite of ""Deathwish""",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2036,"['American', 'Psycho', '2000', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising', 'film', 'surface', 'plot', 'essentially', 'reverse', 'Deathwish', 'Deathwish', 'respectable', 'citizen', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'law', 'secretly', 'kill', 'criminal', 'scumbags', 'name', 'justice', 'American', 'Psycho', 'scumbag', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'respectable', 'citizen', 'secretly', 'murdering', 'innocent', 'people.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'well', 'American', 'psycho', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'impossible', 'care', 'root', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'people', 'film', 'might', 'care', 'root', 'are', 'psycho', 'secretary', 'Jean', 'detective', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', '.So', 'film', 'strike', 'then', 'found', 'getting', 'story', 'meaning', 'was', 'entertained', 'name', 'game', 'cinema.I', 'also', 'got', 'joke', 'American', 'Psycho', 'not', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'drama', 'black', 'comedy', 'satire', 'such', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously', 'be', 'scared', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'amusing', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'head', 'fridge', '.Thankfully', 'American', 'Psycho', 'meaning', 'surface', 'commentary', 'emptiness', 'America', 'materialistic', 'irreligious', 'modern', 'culture', 'innate', 'moral', 'compass', 'been', 'lost', 'passing', 'spiritual', 'faith', 'desperately', 'search', 'meaning', 'secularism', 'materialism', 'pompous', 'titles', 'outward', 'images', 'success', 'generally', 'looking', 'good', 'spiritually', 'bereft', 'Life', 'virtually', 'meaningless', 'mechanics', 'grind', 'everything', 'become', 'mere', 'objects', 'compete', 'fulfill', 'selfish', 'desires', 'Etcetera.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Bale', 'subsequent', 'fame', 'Batman', 'what', 'American', 'Psycho', 'become', 'popular', 'cult', 'film', 'poor', 'performance', 'box', 'office', '2000.This', 'hard', 'R-rated', 'film', 'so', 'stay', 'away', ""'re"", 'not', 'mood', 'heaps', 'violence', 'gore', 'nudity', 'sex', 'cussing.GRADE', 'B-']",American Psycho VHS
72113,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,0783243499,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[4, 5]","I first saw American Psycho in a multiplex in, of all places, Plymouth. I was looking forward to a cool, brilliant, classy, savage satire on yuppiedom, but I think most of the rest of the audience were hoping for a slasher movie. The action was punctuated with cries of ""Kill 'er!"" and ""Stab the slag!"" Ah, Navy towns.Oliver Stone nearly directed this movie, and we should be glad he didn't, when you consider what a daft mess he made of Quentin Tarantino's unpretentiously nasty original script for Natural Born Killers. He also wanted to cast Leonard DiCaprio, who at the time was one of the biggest stars in the world. How fashions change, eh? Fortunately, it reverted to Mary Harron (who'd proved herself on I Shot Andy Warhol) and she got to have her first choice in the lead, Christian Bale. Bale's performance is one of the most rip-roaring in Nineties cinema; he's like the concentrated essence of yuppie, sun-dried (or is it freeze-dried?) yuppie. That he had to remake his body and create the accent from the ground up suits the character perfectly. Patrick Bateman is, as he says himself, all mask - there is nobody there. The smirking, male-model relish with which Bale delivers lines like ""The Mud Soup with Charcoal Arugula is outrageous!"" is a sight to behold. It's surely intentional that he and his pals (chiefly Josh Lucas and Justin Theroux, respectively excellent in Wonderland and Mulholland Dr.) look like nothing so much as a bunch of guys in a Hugo Boss ad, as they sit around and make offensive remarks about women and Jews. (""Hey,"" says Patrick with sweet reasonableness, ""cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks, okay?"")The screenwriters, Harron herself and Guinevere Turner (who, weirdly, had previously co-written and starred in the sweet lesbian love story Go Fish), manage to drag the satirical essence of Ellis' novel onto the screen. It's a book like ""Naked Lunch"", in that nobody would let you film it exactly the way it's written. Probably only women could be so funny about how insane men can get. The actual butchery is more hinted at than shown; Bateman meets a model in a club, the next day he's twirling a lock of her hair in his fist, and that evening we notice in passing that her severed head is in his freezer. There's the notorious moment with the twirling chainsaw, and there's the hilarious and appalling Huey Lewis/axe attack moment, but there's not much else to make you lose your dinner. My only regret is that the final shot, with the ""This Is Not An Exit"" sign discreetly placed behind Bale's head, is all but lost on the small screen.It can also be argued that Bateman's crackup, when he hysterically confesses all his killings over the phone to his lawyer, somewhat draws the teeth of the rest of the movie, in that nobody appears to notice what he's done. The viewer is all but forced to the conclusion that it was all in his head. Bale is brilliant in the scene, even strangely touching, but as a piece of writing (and a moment of utter faithfulness to the book) you can't help wondering whether these people want to make some good satire or just...yawn...play around with, like, textuality.
