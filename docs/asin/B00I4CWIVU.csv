1693471,A1LX3GUBXMR3RS,B00I4CWIVU,FilmFoodie,"[9, 12]","I found this potentially innovative piece an exploitative ruse. Message movies are tricky. It helps if there is a more universal appeal and a clear relatable point of view. It'll help you to know this is a mocumentary; a movie within a movie of sorts that breaks the fourth wall in innovative ways. For me it sets but denies expectations by pretending to be something it's not. When it exposes itself  as a ruse the point is nullified. Starting as if a documentary about filming a vision of the scenes deleted from the 1980 film Cruising, I expected the process of recreating the scenes and the final vision rendered. Cruising was a bad Hollywood film from 1980 starring Al Pacino; I didn't go in expecting a titillating experience. I maybe expected some message about ignorance, how far we've come with comparisons using dated standards, something along those lines. But, the film seemed to be exploiting its focus on actors thrown together at the last minute who are about to film gay sex and we were going to watch. I was a bit baffled by that. However, as the film slowly progresses, focus continues on the actors, mostly the lead who is uncomfortable about the project. So, I switch gears thinking I'm watching a doc about the reactions of actors about to make these scenes, an expose on mens' attitudes about gay sex, or unconventional sexuality, or a statement piece about sex as art or the fear of sex in the modern age. (The film focuses solely on the male actors. Attitudes of the crew where the women are don't exist.) The ruse was exposed to me, when on camera, an actor is directed what to say during what was first depicted as a not so interesting candid conversation.  In the final act, when the 4th wall is shattered by the lead reading the script, which is describing what he is doing at that moment while taking a break from the set, I also heard, ""everything you've just seen was scripted. This is a narrative drama message piece. So, ha HA, just kidding."" The emotional propulsion and the message, slow and superficial as it is, is undone.There are a few short mock scenes from Cruising put together that are so inauthentic they destabilize the foundation the film is built on. Whether there's something that advances anything in this, I can not tell you. Straight people are uncomfortable with gay sex? Uhm, well yeah. Most everyone is uncomfortable engaging in intimacy of a sort to which they are not inclined. So, that can't be it; can it?  Really, a lot that the movie demonstrates is one big Duh! There is stigma about sex and alternative sexuality. But the film doesn't forward the argument in the way it portends; and frankly it's boring.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[42, 46]","I love movies and, more than anything, I appreciate those within the Hollywood system who still take chances and push boundaries.  There is a certain carefulness and an unfortunate homogeneous quality to the film product released for mass consumption.  In many ways, I really respect that James Franco still exhibits an adventurous spirit and parlays his fame into initiating independent side projects that interest him.  He does exactly what he wants to do (from an artistic standpoint) and there should be a lot more of that in celebrity culture today!  I don't need my celebrity filtered through a gauze of political correctness with a pre-recorded message written by a public relations firm.  That being said, I think he's still finding his way as a writer and director but I respect his efforts to explore the film medium.  ""Interior. Leather Bar."" is his latest provocation.  Not really a full fledged documentary, the movie explores what happens on the set (it's all apparently done in one day) of an experimental project conceived by Franco and writer/director Travis Mathews.I am fully prepared to see five star raves that equate ""Interior. Leather Bar."" to a brilliant social critique.  I'm also expecting to see plenty of one star dismissals that call this pointless and even pornographic.  I'll just say this.  There are some interesting discussion-worthy ideas brought up by the movie, but there is little to no follow-through on examining these notions with any depth.So, the idea behind ""Interior. Leather Bar"" is to reconstruct forty minutes of lost footage from William Friedkin's notorious ""Cruising.""  This 1980 film starring Al Pacino was definitely controversial for its day for its rather one sided depiction of a same sex culture.  Of course, no one knows what was cut from the movie exactly but Franco and team speculate that it was pretty graphic stuff.  If, however, this was actually the topic they were interested in pursuing, I find it incredibly telling that few of the actors have any idea that it is what they've shown up to do.  Wouldn't that have been, perhaps, a topic of discussion in the casting process?  In fact, during the shoot, it is revealed that many have never even heard of Cruising even on the day of filming!  Mind you, these aren't professional actors.  They are paid to stand around a bar and simulate sexual acts.  There is no dialogue or plot to speak of, the scenes are just a combination of pantomimed sexual exploits intercut with actual coupling.Thesis Number One: Franco says that sex should be better represented in cinema as opposed to the gratuitous violence and bloodshed that people find quite palatable. I don't disagree. It's a fair point and one I stand behind. But as what he is shooting isn't a real movie in any context (but only sex), it feels a bit hollow. These sequences could never make it into a mainstream movie, of any sexual proclivity, because they lack context more than anything.Thesis Number Two: Instead of giving lip service to ""Cruising,"" the movie should just have called itself a bold sexual experiment. Bringing various actors together with differing sexual identities, the exploration of what makes them uncomfortable (either in viewing or participating) is a primary thesis. I think the discussion, again, could be a fascinating one. But once more, they aren't playing real characters in a real movie. They've shown up for one day of filming to be (essentially) extras. It's hard to get into the heart of this weighty discussion within this framework, although it is a solid idea.Both of these ideas are explored somewhat, but lack any particular depth. The movie, instead, centers around actor Val Lauren. Lauren is a straight married friend of Franco who has worked on other projects with the filmmaker in both theater and on film. The story (and much of it seems written) revolves around this being an eye-opening experiment for the actor, a chance to push his personal boundaries for the sake of art. But again, he isn't inhabiting a complex character on a movie shoot, he's a day player in some provocative footage. He gets conveniently timed phone calls to question the integrity of the project (with much hatred), so that he can wrestle with his decisions. In the end, it's only manufactured drama for the sake of having any real type of drama.""Interior. Leather Bar."" is what it is.

I liked the film &#34;Cruising&#34; with Al Pacino and also being a gay man was pretty intrigued with this little documentary. I never knew there was 4o minutes that were actually cut from the original film to avoid a X rating. Sadly I had my reservations when the whole film is near 60 minutes and its mainly just talking and misunderstandings from mainly the actor who portrays the young Al Pacino. Everything from his buddy not understanding why he is choosing to do this little film with Franco to his wife making stupid jokes and having to now purchase a strap on. Come on!The only thing that did kind of surprise me and sadly the only exiting thing too about the film was the sex and nudity that was downright well ...tantalizing but I guess I just didn't see James Franco's point completely. I understood his point with sex seems to be taboo and people shy away from it but have no problems with killings and violence in film. He is so right about that.

Yes, it's preachy....in fact, it's far preachier than it is sexy or daring or controversial.  The filmmakers seem to think that showing a few seconds of male on male oral sex and bootlicking makes this film edgy but when the rest of the film is full of boring self-absorbed dialogue and laughable discussions of how important the film is, this film may go down as the the most snore worthy sex film in the history of Hollywood.  Thankfully, it's all over quickly...these sorts of self-absorbed people who live off of their perceived importance are not the kind with whom you want to spend too much time.  I came away thinking the filmmakers wanted to push buttons but I didn't feel pushed.  I didn't feel entertained.  And with a film so shallow, I certainly didn't feel educated.  Perhaps Mr. Franco believes that showing a few seconds of gay sex is better than creating art where gay people aren't summed up by their body parts or sex acts.
