1222624,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B001OLP2TI,CGScammell,"[5, 16]","This is a good video to learn about the Knights Templar, their history at the start of the Crusade to their demise in 1307.The first few chapters talk about its origins during the first Crusade.  The organization started out as protectors of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, the vast majority were illiterate killers, psychopathic monks, who pillaged, plundered, raped and murdered anyone they could (and not just Muslims).  They were in short not the ""knights in shining armor"" that more romantic stories led you to believe, but more like Special Forces soldiers on steroids, or, better yet, the first church-sanctioned terrorist group.  So how did a once elite and honorable group of knights fell so quickly out of power? Had they become too wealthy (they organized what many would call the first international money-lending banks in western Europe).  Did the church forced them into secrecy?  Few documents exist today that prove anything about this rough-and-tumble warriors that even made Saladin cringe in horror.Athough there are plenty of short reenactments here, they are background.  You don't waste much time watching Hollywood fat guys wielding rubber swords at each other and screaming death cries into the microphone.  You can even play this in your car's CD player on your way to work and listen to informative narrative.The nice thing about this documentary is that the historians are honest about how or why the Templar fell. No one knows for sure.  There are plenty of reasons of why the knights saw their demise.  Speculation abounds here, such as were they forced into anonymous secrecy once it became known that the knights had discovered hidden documents about Jesus and Magdalene, documents the Catholic church did not want publicized?  Why is so little known about the demise of these once-elite soldiers?Although the documentary loses some focus in the last two chapters (there are 13), and there is some repetition of the text in chapters 2-4, I still would recommend this video for novice historians.  This may not win any glorious awards, but it will educate and perhaps even entertain the viewer.",4,Terrorists or Keepers of the Holy Grail?,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,2144,"['good', 'video', 'learn', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'history', 'start', 'Crusade', 'demise', '1307.The', 'first', 'few', 'chapters', 'talk', 'origins', 'first', 'Crusade', 'organization', 'started', 'out', 'protectors', 'pilgrims', 'way', 'Jerusalem', 'Unfortunately', 'vast', 'majority', 'were', 'illiterate', 'killers', 'psychopathic', 'monks', 'who', 'pillaged', 'plundered', 'raped', 'murdered', 'anyone', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'Muslims', 'were', 'short', 'not', 'knights', 'shining', 'armor', 'more', 'romantic', 'stories', 'led', 'believe', 'more', 'Special', 'Forces', 'soldiers', 'steroids', 'better', 'yet', 'first', 'church-sanctioned', 'terrorist', 'group', 'how', 'did', 'once', 'elite', 'honorable', 'group', 'knights', 'fell', 'so', 'quickly', 'power', 'Had', 'become', 'too', 'wealthy', 'organized', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'call', 'first', 'international', 'money-lending', 'banks', 'western', 'Europe', 'church', 'forced', 'secrecy', 'Few', 'documents', 'exist', 'today', 'prove', 'anything', 'rough-and-tumble', 'warriors', 'even', 'made', 'Saladin', 'cringe', 'horror.Athough', 'are', 'plenty', 'short', 'reenactments', 'here', 'are', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'fat', 'guys', 'wielding', 'rubber', 'swords', 'other', 'screaming', 'death', 'cries', 'microphone', 'can', 'even', 'play', 'car', 'CD', 'player', 'way', 'work', 'listen', 'informative', 'narrative.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'documentary', 'historians', 'are', 'honest', 'how', 'why', 'Templar', 'fell', 'one', 'sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'why', 'knights', 'saw', 'demise', 'Speculation', 'here', 'such', 'were', 'forced', 'anonymous', 'secrecy', 'became', 'known', 'knights', 'had', 'discovered', 'hidden', 'documents', 'Jesus', 'Magdalene', 'documents', 'Catholic', 'church', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'publicized', 'Why', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'demise', 'once-elite', 'soldiers', 'documentary', 'focus', 'last', 'two', 'chapters', 'are', '13', 'repetition', 'text', 'chapters', '2-4', 'still', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'novice', 'historians', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'glorious', 'awards', 'will', 'educate', 'perhaps', 'even', 'entertain', 'viewer']",N/A

There is a lot of material about The Crusades, a good bit about leaders of Templars such as Jacques DeMolay, and some delving into the intriguing aspects of treasure and lost holy relics.

I found the video as a very well done historical account of the Knights story.  Edward Herrmann narrates the program in his usual outstanding voice coupled with at least six well known expert researchers of our time on this subject.  There are a few errors in the script (Richard the Lion-Heart takes back the Holy Land in 1227?) that the novice will not notice.  Otherwise, the story covers the first three crusades and then jumps to the end of the 13th century.  The story begins to ends with the arrest of the Knights Templar by Phillip the Fair (IV) of France on 13 October 1307, Friday The 13th.The video provides speculation as to what ultimately happened to the order and even discusses the story of the &#8220;Money Pit&#8221; on Oak Island looking for their treasure in modern times.

A few castle ruins, references to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, some actors portraying sword fight battles on foot and horseback, a little bit of speculation on the Holy Grail (what it is; where it is), some footage inside Rosslyn Chapel for codes found in architectural design emphasis, some reproduction and history of the legendary Money Pit on Oak Island, and other insignificant background history for the Knights Templar; such as tunnels that have yet to be excavated that are rumored to at least have the potential for artifacts undiscovered since the fall of the Knights Templar.  This DVD is one of the more basic introductory level videos, and won't satisfy many researchers, some of the interviews are with scholars who have a very heavy brogue and most of whom are quite cynical about details alleged by what little literature offers down through time since the rise and fall of the Knights Templar; although the narrator's voice is distinct and easily understandable.  I found this DVD sufficient only to beat insomnia, and was disappointed in the superficial substance from a quality distribution studio that obviously spent some time and expenditure to produce.  Costuming for reenactment sequences is as good as anything Hollywood has, but we probably only need to see those clips in this video once, not multiple times of the same sequence.  Entertaining, for what there is of it this video has been done with quality, and is good enough for the uninitiated as a starting point toward learning about the Knights Templar, but far, far from genuinely informative (more or less between elementary school and junior high students seems to be the marketing audience).",4,"I wasn't actually there at the time to be absolutely sure, but -",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1818,"['Decoding', 'Past', 'Templar', 'Code', 'History', 'Channel', 'narrated', 'reproduction', 'myth', 'folklore', 'surrounding', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'A', 'few', 'castle', 'ruins', 'references', 'Solomon', 'Temple', 'Jerusalem', 'actors', 'portraying', 'sword', 'fight', 'battles', 'foot', 'horseback', 'little', 'bit', 'speculation', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'what', 'where', 'footage', 'Rosslyn', 'Chapel', 'codes', 'found', 'architectural', 'design', 'emphasis', 'reproduction', 'history', 'legendary', 'Money', 'Pit', 'Oak', 'Island', 'other', 'insignificant', 'background', 'history', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'such', 'tunnels', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'excavated', 'are', 'rumored', 'least', 'have', 'potential', 'artifacts', 'undiscovered', 'fall', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'DVD', 'one', 'more', 'basic', 'introductory', 'level', 'videos', 'wo', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'many', 'researchers', 'interviews', 'are', 'scholars', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'heavy', 'brogue', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'quite', 'cynical', 'details', 'alleged', 'what', 'little', 'literature', 'down', 'time', 'rise', 'fall', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'narrator', 'voice', 'distinct', 'easily', 'understandable', 'found', 'DVD', 'sufficient', 'only', 'beat', 'insomnia', 'was', 'disappointed', 'superficial', 'substance', 'quality', 'distribution', 'studio', 'obviously', 'spent', 'time', 'expenditure', 'produce', 'Costuming', 'reenactment', 'sequences', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'probably', 'only', 'need', 'see', 'clips', 'video', 'once', 'not', 'multiple', 'times', 'same', 'sequence', 'Entertaining', 'what', 'video', 'been', 'done', 'quality', 'good', 'enough', 'uninitiated', 'starting', 'point', 'learning', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'far', 'far', 'genuinely', 'informative', 'more', 'less', 'elementary', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'be', 'marketing', 'audience']",N/A

If you therefore can approach a series such as this one on the Knights Templar understanding the purpose and goals of the History Channel, then it is unlikely you'll end up disappointed. To the contrary, this introduction to the Knights Templar is brilliantly scripted, filmed, and acted, and the series can serve, not only as a great way to understand this medieval organization, but to be thoroughly entertained as you do.Without trying to reproduce the content that is presented in this series, we can say that this set of four episodes will provide a thorough grounding to understand the Templars, and will do so in a manner that is detailed enough to easily allow the non-historian to segue from the show into additional derivative studies. Although there is a certain mystique about this group that has been fanned in recent years by some best-selling novels, the producers here attempt to stay a steady course through the topic without resorting to too much speculative ideas (although there are some reproduced here, particularly at the end of the series).In addition to a very strong script, the location filming, along with superior quality video equipment, makes this more of an epic movie in its production values. There is not a moment when we think we are watching poor recreations or sub-standard video reels: this is truly state-of-the-art production quality (although, no, it is not high-definition), and the costumes, recreated scenes, and site locations make this production stand out from others. Be sure also to see the bonus footage, which shows some of the background in creating the series, also an excellent production itself.Easy five stars for production, script, and meeting the objectives of learning about the Knights Templar.
