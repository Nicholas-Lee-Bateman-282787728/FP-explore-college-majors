As with ""East is East..."" there is plenty of humour but unlike the former, there is more of a story to be told. The son, coming to terms with a foot in two significantly different cultures and struggling to know his own identity in this. The father having to take responsibility for decisions made long ago and which threaten to unravel around him as his two wives always kept separate; one in England, one in Pakistan meet. Some of the story line is predictable, some so farfetched as to annoy. But the feel good quality is so warm you forgive the flaws which are minor. Uplifting, funny and reflective. Not a bad combination.",4,The sequel without as much punch,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,744,"['However', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'contemporary', 'Pakistan', 'way', 'sympathetic', 'East', 'East', 'plenty', 'humour', 'former', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'son', 'coming', 'terms', 'foot', 'two', 'significantly', 'different', 'cultures', 'struggling', 'know', 'own', 'identity', 'father', 'having', 'take', 'responsibility', 'decisions', 'made', 'long', 'ago', 'threaten', 'unravel', 'around', 'two', 'wives', 'always', 'kept', 'separate', 'one', 'England', 'one', 'Pakistan', 'meet', 'story', 'line', 'predictable', 'so', 'farfetched', 'annoy', 'feel', 'good', 'quality', 'so', 'warm', 'forgive', 'flaws', 'are', 'minor', 'Uplifting', 'funny', 'reflective', 'Not', 'bad', 'combination']",N/A
1518988,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B006QKAJTK,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","A sequel to EAST IS EAST (1999), WEST IS WEST follows the passage of George/ Jahangir (Om Puri) as he travels with son Sajd (Aqib Khan) to Pakistan so as to 'educate' his son.  However the process of adapting to the new culture after a life spent in Salford, Greater Manchester, proves more difficult for George than it does for his son.  Andy De Emmony's film makes some trenchant points about the difficulties of cultural adaptation, and how it is impossible to 'go back' to one's home culture and expect to live life as one did before emigrating.  There are some very funny moments in this film, especially Sajd as he gradually adjusts himself to alternative ways of life.  However the ending represents a bit of a cop-out, as George/Jahangir returns to Britain to resume his life as a chip-shop owner with his second wife Ella (Linda Bassett), leaving his first wife Raushana (Dhanalaxmi Padmakumar) to fend for herself - just as he has done for most of the previous three decades.  The fact that he can re-open the chip shop - despite having no money - seems a little hard to believe; and we wonder how he will be able to take care of his Pakistani family in the future, even if it means only sending them money.",3,Feel-Good Movie with an Implausible Ending,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1217,"['sequel', 'EAST', 'IS', 'EAST', '1999', 'WEST', 'IS', 'WEST', 'passage', 'George/', 'Jahangir', 'Om', 'Puri', 'son', 'Sajd', 'Aqib', 'Khan', 'Pakistan', 'so', ""'educate"", 'son', 'However', 'process', 'adapting', 'new', 'culture', 'life', 'spent', 'Salford', 'Greater', 'Manchester', 'more', 'difficult', 'George', 'son', 'Andy', 'De', 'Emmony', 'film', 'trenchant', 'points', 'difficulties', 'cultural', 'adaptation', 'how', 'impossible', ""'go"", 'back', 'one', 'home', 'culture', 'expect', 'live', 'life', 'one', 'did', 'emigrating', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', 'Sajd', 'gradually', 'alternative', 'ways', 'life', 'However', 'ending', 'bit', 'cop-out', 'George/Jahangir', 'Britain', 'resume', 'life', 'chip-shop', 'owner', 'second', 'wife', 'Ella', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'leaving', 'first', 'wife', 'Raushana', 'Dhanalaxmi', 'Padmakumar', 'fend', 'just', 'done', 'most', 'previous', 'three', 'decades', 'fact', 'can', 're-open', 'chip', 'shop', 'having', 'money', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'Pakistani', 'family', 'future', 'even', 'only', 'sending', 'money']",N/A

While West is West is enjoyable, it isn't really a comedy, more of a drama with comedic moments. George becomes a somewhat pathetic character, an outsider in England and now an outsider at home in Pakistan rejected by his wife and old friends.
