It was no longer enough for the police to make an arrest, but they had to lock down their evidence and in the best case a confession. In the second season, the show starts to explore the new territory. It has some of the most humorous episodes, which don't break the drama of the show. Unlike later seasons where the &#34;I Must Break You&#34; interview where Brenda Leigh gets the suspects to confess starts to wear thinly, this season still has a lot of surprises.

The quality is smoother and they have more deleted scenes as well as a gag reel and in depth discussion about the beginning and evolution of this unusual woman and her team.The first season shows us the awkward attempts of the new Deputy Chief of Priority Homicie, Brenda Leigh Johnson, and her team to function as such. They fought through their misconceptions and prejudices to become a top group of investigators with the best interrogator to seal the deal.Season 2 began with ""Blue Blood"" which dramatized the transformation of those serving under Deputy Chief Johnson with barely concealed hostility to loyal defenders as they investigate the suspicious death of another police officer. Season 2 also shows how willing Brenda is to support her people, even when they have pulled a lame stunt, such as is found in ""To Protect & Serve"", which features Detectives Provenza and Flynn in a few hilarious moments.Season 2 ended with ""Overkill"" a dramatic offering, which left the future of our heroes in doubt. Months later TNT aired two one-hour specials, ""Serving the King, Pts 1 & 2, which tied up those loose ends with great style. Kevin Bacon, husband of star, Kyra Sedgwick, directed one of the episodes.Season 1 focused on the dissension among the Priority Homicide team under their new leader. Season 2 focuses on how effective the team is now that they trust and even admire each other.

As the title to this piece indicates, so far I've only watched the second disc of the second season.  I do like it, however, mostly because of the rather quirky character of Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson.  Her rank poses a question in my mind; some might say because of an overly active left-brain.  In one episode, Brenda Johnson has her 40th birthday.  The rank of deputy chief in the LAPD is a VERY high rank; one would assume that it would require many years of excellent service (along with some luck plus high-level mentoring) to rise that high.  So, my question is: how could Brenda Johnson have made the rank of deputy chief before her 40th birthday?  To continue, according to the LAPD organizational chart, the rank of deputy chief is a command level rank; a person of that rank usually commands a bureau (which is made of of several areas (analogous to precincts in NYC)) or a specialized city-wide function, such as the Detective Bureau or the SWAT/Special Operations Bureau.  So-o-o-o, why is Deputy Chief Johnson depicted as commanding a squad (albeit a rank-heavy one as there seem to be two or three detective lieutenants and two or three detective sergeants)?  OK, now for my last and final question.  Perhaps I missed something, but in the episodes that I watched, Brenda Johnson refers certain persons with the title of ""commander"", whom she seems to treat as her superior officers.  However, again referring to the LAPD org chart (and on-line LAPD rank structure), a commander is subordinate to a deputy chief.  Again, did I miss something?Oh yeah, The Closer has police characters that are not what one would usually expect in a ""cop show"".

The second season features some complications --for Brenda. Fritz proposes moving in and being asked out on a date by her boss spurs her to say yes even though she probably should say no. Then he moves out. Why? Brenda's mom (Francis McDormand)comes to town and, well, she'd just be horrified if her adult daughter had a live-in boyfriend.The cases vary from bizarre (a police officer and psycho killer manage to kill each other at exactly the same time even though the they weren't standing in the right proximity)to sad (a juror dies just before she and the jury are about to annonce a verdict for a client of a heart attack. It turns out that the jury was threatened). This second season continued the terrific writing,acting and direction as Brenda tried to crack difficult murder cases by cracking the suspects. Kyra Sedgewick continues to be top notch in the role and I'm disappointed and surprised that she hasn't won more awards for her performance. The reality is that this show has such a small but devoted audience (relatively large for basic cable though and TNT)that it's easy to overlook.
