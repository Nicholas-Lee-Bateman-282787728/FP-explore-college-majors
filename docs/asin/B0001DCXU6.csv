800805,A11A9UUJ0WPMDK,B0001DCXU6,Ashbash,"[8, 15]","What a disappointment this was!  I consider myself intermed. level in terms of yoga, although i have been dancing for 22 years and am very active in all exercise routines.  I don't know a lot of yoga theory, but I like to do it for strength training, and flexibility and the challenge it provides physically as it relaxes me mentally.  So far, i have found nothing that compares to Brian Kests'series, and Mark Blanckard trilogy and Yoga Radiance; Four Seasons of Renewal. I bought this DVD after a yoga teacher recommended it for her vinyasa yoga styl, and that Seane Corn was the big hype amongst the celebrities and such.  I had high expectation that were sorely unmet.  I was looking for something challenging, and refreshing and this was neither.  All of her poses and transitions were entirely too basic, which she only had a few poses for the entire DVD-I kept asking myself - is that it? For example, through out the whole DVD she would only move into cobra and never graduated into up dog, her transition to down dog would always go from knees on the floor up to down dog. This is not my kinda style, especially if there is nothing to work towards for improvement.If you are a pre beginner, or have never had any flexibility, this DVD is perfect for you! otherwise, I would keep looking...Good luck!",2,greatly disappointed......,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,1308,"['What', 'disappointment', 'was', 'consider', 'intermed', 'level', 'terms', 'yoga', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'dancing', '22', 'years', 'am', 'very', 'active', 'exercise', 'routines', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lot', 'yoga', 'theory', 'like', 'do', 'strength', 'training', 'flexibility', 'challenge', 'physically', 'mentally', 'So', 'far', 'i', 'have', 'found', 'nothing', 'Brian', ""Kests'series"", 'Mark', 'Blanckard', 'trilogy', 'Yoga', 'Radiance', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'Renewal', 'bought', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'recommended', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'styl', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'was', 'big', 'hype', 'celebrities', 'such', 'had', 'high', 'expectation', 'were', 'sorely', 'unmet', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'challenging', 'refreshing', 'was', 'poses', 'transitions', 'were', 'entirely', 'too', 'basic', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'poses', 'entire', 'DVD-I', 'kept', 'asking', 'example', 'whole', 'DVD', 'would', 'only', 'move', 'cobra', 'never', 'graduated', 'dog', 'transition', 'down', 'dog', 'would', 'always', 'go', 'knees', 'floor', 'down', 'dog', 'not', 'kinda', 'style', 'especially', 'nothing', 'work', 'towards', 'improvement.If', 'are', 'pre', 'beginner', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'flexibility', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'otherwise', 'would', 'keep', 'looking', 'Good', 'luck']",N/A

When I say less is more, I am talking about the set that she is working on.  There are no distractions on the dvd to worry about breaking your concentration.  It is just Ms. Corn in a black outfit on a black set, so you can concentrate on following along with the workout.  Also, I appreciated the fact that she did the practice while she was talking and not doing the practice while somebody else was narrarating.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of the next Seane Corn dvd.",5,Less is More,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,618,"['Ms.', 'Corn', 'wonderful', 'job', 'dvd', 'just', 'did', 'first', 'dvd', 'would', 'suggest', 'one', 'disc', 'anyone', 'interested', 'yoga', 'When', 'say', 'less', 'more', 'am', 'talking', 'set', 'working', 'are', 'distractions', 'dvd', 'worry', 'breaking', 'concentration', 'just', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'black', 'outfit', 'black', 'set', 'can', 'concentrate', 'following', 'along', 'workout', 'Also', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'did', 'practice', 'was', 'talking', 'not', 'doing', 'practice', 'somebody', 'else', 'was', 'narrarating', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'release', 'next', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'dvd']",N/A

800808,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B0001DCXU6,James E. White,"[133, 136]","This DVD was great if you want a slower flowing yoga DVD.  I think this DVD is good for just about anybody familiar with yoga, and how to use yoga blocks.  Seane starts off slowly with meditation, breathing exercises, and then slowly starts going into the actual postures.  The postures themselves were not difficult for advanced beginner and up practioners.  However, Seane goes through these postures slowly enough where you will start to feel different parts of your body open up.  Seane pays a fair amount of attention to alignment (moreso than I am use to seeing in a Vinyasa Flow type DVD).  She takes her time getting into and out of the postures and this where I feel anyone can benefit from this DVD.If you are the type of person looking for a Vinyasa Flow DVD to make you move, sweat, drop a few pounds, or want very challenging  postures, then this probably is not the DVD for you.  I would suggest Shiva Rae's Yoga Shakti DVD which has something for almost every skill level, except maybe the truly gifted and advanced yogis/yoginis out there (the arm balances she does are almost all intermediate to advanced).  However, if you want to really focus on the alignment and feeling of some of the more basic postures, and you are looking for something slower than the average flow yoga DVD, then this is a home run.",5,Slow Flow with an Iyengar twist,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1324,"['DVD', 'was', 'great', 'want', 'slower', 'flowing', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'think', 'DVD', 'good', 'just', 'anybody', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'how', 'use', 'yoga', 'blocks', 'Seane', 'slowly', 'meditation', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'then', 'slowly', 'going', 'actual', 'postures', 'postures', 'were', 'not', 'difficult', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'practioners', 'However', 'Seane', 'postures', 'slowly', 'enough', 'where', 'will', 'start', 'feel', 'different', 'parts', 'body', 'open', 'up', 'Seane', 'fair', 'amount', 'attention', 'alignment', 'moreso', 'am', 'use', 'seeing', 'Vinyasa', 'Flow', 'type', 'DVD', 'time', 'getting', 'postures', 'where', 'feel', 'anyone', 'can', 'benefit', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'looking', 'Vinyasa', 'Flow', 'DVD', 'make', 'move', 'sweat', 'drop', 'few', 'pounds', 'want', 'very', 'challenging', 'postures', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'DVD', 'would', 'suggest', 'Shiva', 'Rae', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'DVD', 'something', 'almost', 'skill', 'level', 'maybe', 'truly', 'gifted', 'advanced', 'there', 'arm', 'are', 'almost', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'However', 'want', 'really', 'focus', 'alignment', 'feeling', 'more', 'basic', 'postures', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'slower', 'average', 'flow', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'then', 'home', 'run']",N/A
800809,A1WJB8XX7ZC9H9,B0001DCXU6,"Nicole Domini ""Nicole Domini""","[46, 58]","To be honest, Seane Corn is not my favorite yoga instructor.  To be sure, she pays close attention to detail, explaining proper alignment, which is crucial to any solid yoga practice.  She is very articulate, and the combination of poses in this dvd make for an excellent daily yoga practice for harmonizing the mind, body, and soul.  For these reasons, I often find myself putting in her dvd, gearing up for my daily session.  However, within minutes, I again find myself turning it off and instead reaching for another dvd, perhaps Rainbeau Mars or Shiva Rea.  Why?  It seems to me Seane is still a very nervous person, and I feel this comes through in her teaching.  While she is explaining to the student how yoga can calm the mind, she races through her words, speaking abruptly and 100 miles per hour.  Just listening to her starts to send my mind into more chaos, and she tends to disturb the inner peaceful world I have been creating for myself through yoga, rather than enhance it!  I rate this dvd a 3 because, on days when I can put her racing, nervous explanations to the side, I still find that she has put together a nice, long, complete and flowing daily yoga practice.  -Nicole",3,definitely not my favorite,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1193,"['be', 'honest', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'not', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'be', 'sure', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'explaining', 'proper', 'alignment', 'crucial', 'solid', 'yoga', 'practice', 'very', 'articulate', 'combination', 'poses', 'dvd', 'make', 'excellent', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practice', 'harmonizing', 'mind', 'body', 'soul', 'reasons', 'often', 'find', 'putting', 'dvd', 'gearing', 'up', 'daily', 'session', 'However', 'minutes', 'again', 'find', 'turning', 'off', 'instead', 'reaching', 'dvd', 'perhaps', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Why', 'Seane', 'still', 'very', 'nervous', 'person', 'feel', 'through', 'teaching', 'explaining', 'student', 'how', 'yoga', 'can', 'calm', 'mind', 'words', 'speaking', 'abruptly', '100', 'miles', 'hour', 'Just', 'listening', 'starts', 'send', 'mind', 'more', 'chaos', 'disturb', 'inner', 'peaceful', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'creating', 'yoga', 'rather', 'enhance', 'rate', '3', 'days', 'when', 'can', 'put', 'racing', 'nervous', 'explanations', 'side', 'still', 'find', 'put', 'together', 'nice', 'long', 'complete', 'flowing', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practice', '-Nicole']",N/A
800810,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B0001DCXU6,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[49, 50]","In disk one, Seane Corn teaches in a simple stage alone with beautiful muted music. Some have complained she talks too much, but it's all about the pose, getting in/out, what to watch out for, how to place all body parts (I learned new info even after 4 years & 30 yoga dvds.) Her speaking while moving (not narrating) wasn't hurried or stressed in my opinion at all. I think with all her info it helped me to be more present & not let my mind wander to daily worries. I do like when the yoga teacher speaks since it reminds me to be aware of where my body is & what I am doing.This DVD contained the usual sun salutations (plank, lunges, upward dog, cobra, downward dog) & triangle, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, child's pose, twisted triangle, butterfly, seated leg stretching just like her first DVD, but also twisted side angle pose, chair/powerful pose, locust, bridge, boat, lotus, alternate standing 1 leg to knee to really stretch the hamstrings, 1 legged stand, wide legged forward bends, twisted indian pose for back, twisted sage pose, bharadvaja's twist & lower back common stretches & ones I've never seen before that worked for me better then others since I'm very flexible, were great & a few I can't remember.In disk 2 there are 2 sessions.There is the short form of 40 min that includes most of these poses (sun salutations, lunges, triangle, side angle, lunges, bridge, wide-legged fwd bend, twisted sage pose, etc.) where she guides you WITH TALKING (not narrating overlay) like the first one ending with a 3 min corpse pose.The second one is an hour & 15 min, but it just music & her slow, deep, perfect breathing.I will definitely be using this in the future to make sure I keep my posture correct which I realize my form was already sloppy by using this disc.You can see a preview at gaiam com",4,Great instruction yoga dvd,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,1812,"['disk', 'one', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'teaches', 'simple', 'stage', 'alone', 'beautiful', 'muted', 'music', 'have', 'complained', 'too', 'much', 'pose', 'getting', 'in/out', 'what', 'watch', 'out', 'how', 'place', 'body', 'parts', 'learned', 'new', 'info', 'even', '4', 'years', '30', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'speaking', 'moving', 'not', 'narrating', 'was', ""n't"", 'hurried', 'stressed', 'opinion', 'think', 'info', 'helped', 'be', 'more', 'present', 'not', 'let', 'mind', 'wander', 'daily', 'worries', 'do', 'when', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'be', 'aware', 'where', 'body', 'what', 'am', 'doing.This', 'DVD', 'contained', 'usual', 'sun', 'salutations', 'plank', 'lunges', 'upward', 'dog', 'cobra', 'downward', 'dog', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'warrior', '1', '2', 'child', 'pose', 'twisted', 'triangle', 'butterfly', 'seated', 'leg', 'stretching', 'just', 'first', 'DVD', 'also', 'twisted', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'chair/powerful', 'pose', 'locust', 'bridge', 'boat', 'lotus', 'alternate', 'standing', '1', 'leg', 'knee', 'really', 'stretch', 'hamstrings', '1', 'legged', 'stand', 'wide', 'legged', 'forward', 'bends', 'twisted', 'indian', 'pose', 'back', 'twisted', 'sage', 'pose', 'bharadvaja', 'twist', 'lower', 'back', 'common', 'stretches', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'worked', 'better', 'then', 'others', ""'m"", 'very', 'flexible', 'were', 'great', 'few', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember.In', 'disk', '2', 'are', '2', 'sessions.There', 'short', 'form', '40', 'min', 'most', 'poses', 'sun', 'salutations', 'lunges', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'lunges', 'bridge', 'wide-legged', 'fwd', 'bend', 'twisted', 'sage', 'pose', 'etc', 'where', 'WITH', 'TALKING', 'not', 'narrating', 'overlay', 'first', 'one', 'ending', '3', 'min', 'corpse', 'pose.The', 'second', 'one', 'hour', '15', 'min', 'just', 'music', 'slow', 'deep', 'perfect', 'breathing.I', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'using', 'future', 'make', 'sure', 'keep', 'posture', 'correct', 'realize', 'form', 'was', 'already', 'sloppy', 'using', 'disc.You', 'can', 'see', 'preview', 'gaiam', 'com']",N/A
