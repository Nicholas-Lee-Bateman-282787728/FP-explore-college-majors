Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[11, 24]","I'm sorry, but Dave Chappelle set the standard for this type of show, that being stand-up/skit show that skates on the edge of the line of obscene, and Carlos Mencia just borrowed from Chappelle's brilliant idea. Fortunately, though, Mencia does more than enough to set himself apart from Chappelle's Show to make this at least feel somewhat unique. And not only that, but Carlos Mencia is one of the better comedians out today, so using a tried and true formula with a proven comedian promises a good show.And this show is fricken hilarious. Carlos's constant racism does nothing to offend and everything to amuse. I kind of felt during the whole thing that everything is a joke with Mencia, and the fact that he makes fun of himself more often than he does others is probably what does this. And the street skits he does are great, where he basically goes out and spreads his form of comedy while also enlightening us on the common racial stereotypes in the funniest of ways. He also ends ever show with a skit of sorts, usually with Carlos dressing up as some strange character and performing in before the studio audience.I was disappointed with the DVD release, though. The special features were all that great. The bloopers were over way to quick, no one really needs to see a making of a show like this, and I haven't had the chance to see the deleted scenes but if they were deleted then there wasa probably a good reason for it. And now for the audio commentary: I don't speak Spanish, and though I know that's probably the comedy of it, you just can't get anything out of this unless you speak Spanish.With the exception of the special features, though, this a good and inexpensive collection that goes great with Chappelle's Show fans. If you like edgy comedy and aren't easily offended, then pick this up.

He is half German and half Honduran, not Mexican.  There is a huge difference between Mexicans and Hondurans, similar to when former Soviet countries (like Ukraine) hated being called Russian, because they weren't.  There are huge differences between Mexican culture, Mexican-American culture, and Hondurans (and Germans for that matter).  Now changing your birth name to a stage name is a well known practice, but here it's definitely seems like a cynical move with Carlos, who goes around pretending he's Mexican and does the racial angle that's been done before (and better) by Chappelle and Pryor (to name a few).  Many have compared Mencia to Chappelle, but Chappelle is very easy in his skin, is much more insightful, and much funnier.  Ned is belligerent, crass, and obnoxious.  I HAVE SEEN these episodes (even though some reviewers have suggested I haven't), and it's pretty obvious Comedy Central is trying to emulate Chappelle with this guy.  He ain't even close to Chappelle.  And he rips off other comedians quite brazenly, including Bill Cosby himself!  Once in a while you will laugh, then you'll feel uncomfortable, because Mencia is so belligerent, you feel like you have to laugh or he will come into the audience and kill you.  Even if you disregard the fact that he's passing himself off as a Mexican (which is hard to do, as he always makes a point of it in almost every bit he does), and just judge the material on the DVD's, it still isn't very good.

The problem with Carlos is the fact that his jokes never change.  If you've heard one of his acts, you've heard all of his acts.  The first time I ever heard him do stand up I couldn't stop laughing at it.  He was laugh out loud funny to me (which almost never happens with me).  But as the years went on, I found that Carlos Mencia's material would rarely change.  I'm not easily offended.  In fact, I love risk taking comedians, but after a while I began to feel like I'd heard everything Carlos had to say.Fast forward to late 2005/early 2006 and Comedy Central is in a hectic scramble to fill the void that the unintentional smash hit, Chappelle's Show, left after Dave Chappelle goes M.I.A. because he doesn't like the direction of the show is taking.  Thus, Mind Of Mencia is born.  I said to myself ""Carlos is getting a show?  This ought to be great.""  When I tuned in to watch, I found that the show was a b-level version of Chappelle's Show with a hispanic twist and, in a way, it's no fault of Mencia's.  Comedy Central felt like they needed something similar to Chappelle's Show to keep the huge fan base that Chappelle had brought to the channel.  Insert Carlos Mencia.  The blatant imitation coupled with the fact that Mencia talks about the same thing over and over and you have Mind Of Mencia.  Like another reviewer said, Chappelle did jokes about racists while Mencia did racist jokes.If you're new to Mencia's comedy then you'll love it (like I did when I first heard him in the early 90's).  But if you've been listening to him for a while now, then you know he's been talking about the same stuff for at least 12 years and it's beyond repetitive now.  The show is like his stand up -- funny in spots.  The show misses more than it hits and when it does hit, it won't generate anything above a chuckle.Simply put, Dave Chappelle was like sugar.  You'd tune in, watch it, and you'd become addicted to it.  If Dave was sugar, then Mencia is Splenda.  You tune in to the substitute, watch it, and find that it has a familiar flavor......but with a terrible aftertaste.",2,The Splenda Effect  {2.5 Stars},1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2210,"['click', 'not', 'helpful', 'button', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'comedy', 'early/mid', '90', 'problem', 'Carlos', 'fact', 'jokes', 'never', 'change', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'acts', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'acts', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'heard', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'was', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'almost', 'never', 'years', 'went', 'found', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'material', 'would', 'rarely', 'change', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'fact', 'love', 'risk', 'taking', 'comedians', 'while', 'began', 'feel', ""'d"", 'heard', 'everything', 'Carlos', 'had', 'say.Fast', 'forward', 'late', '2005/early', '2006', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'hectic', 'scramble', 'fill', 'void', 'unintentional', 'smash', 'hit', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'left', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'M.I.A', ""n't"", 'like', 'direction', 'show', 'taking', 'Thus', 'Mind', 'Mencia', 'born', 'said', 'myself', 'Carlos', 'getting', 'show', 'ought', 'be', 'great', 'When', 'tuned', 'watch', 'found', 'show', 'was', 'b-level', 'version', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'hispanic', 'twist', 'way', 'fault', 'Mencia', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'felt', 'needed', 'something', 'similar', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'keep', 'huge', 'fan', 'base', 'Chappelle', 'had', 'brought', 'channel', 'Insert', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'blatant', 'imitation', 'coupled', 'fact', 'Mencia', 'talks', 'same', 'thing', 'have', 'Mind', 'Mencia', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Chappelle', 'did', 'jokes', 'racists', 'Mencia', 'did', 'racist', 'jokes.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'Mencia', 'comedy', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'early', '90', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'while', 'now', 'then', 'know', 'been', 'talking', 'same', 'stuff', 'least', '12', 'years', 'repetitive', 'now', 'show', 'stand', 'up', 'funny', 'spots', 'show', 'more', 'when', 'hit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'generate', 'anything', 'chuckle.Simply', 'put', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'was', 'sugar', ""'d"", 'tune', 'watch', ""'d"", 'become', 'addicted', 'Dave', 'was', 'sugar', 'then', 'Mencia', 'Splenda', 'tune', 'substitute', 'watch', 'find', 'familiar', 'flavor', 'terrible', 'aftertaste']",Mind of Mencia: Season One Uncensored

You can be an ""angry nerdy comedian,"" but still nerdy. If you aren't white in the ""traditional"" sense, (As in Carlos, who is actually only half German) this entitles you to force an accent and adopt a culture that you have nothing to do with. This also entitles you scrape the bottom of the racial jokes barrel, since you're not 100% Caucasian, you're obviously just kidding. (White people who tell racial jokes are seeking a fourth reich, and must be stopped.)2: If someone in the audience doesn't laugh, it's NEVER because you're not funny, it's because they are weak PC hall monitors shackled and brainwashed by modern-day taboos. Make sure the rest of the audience knows this; This simultaneously makes you seem genuinely funny, and edgy & ahead of your time.3: Catch-phrases. It matters not how contrived and bland they are, the amount of teenagers you get to awkwardly imitate you at a lunch table is directly equivalent to your worth as a comedian. DEE DEE DEE. (For situations to apply this catch-phrase, see rule 2.)4: Midgets. A show isn't funny without midgets.5: Make sure to fill a void in comedy fans' lives. Make people say, ""This guy is the new _____!""Follow these five rules and become famous for a couple years-- or at least until Chappelle's Show returns.
