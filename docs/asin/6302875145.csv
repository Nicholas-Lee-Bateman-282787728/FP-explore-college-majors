342677,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,6302875145,Jason,"[0, 1]","Picture a small Pennsylvania mining town where a gangly doofus named Rupert (Reeves), who always appears to be stoned, rubs everyone the wrong way with his irritating personality, grating speech patterns, and...wait, all that was kind of redundant.If you can get past the fact that there was a lot more Bill and Ted in Keanu beforeBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, this movie comes down to a familial struggle between a hard-working father and his screw up, dropout son (who has a stupid haircut).  Amidst petty affairs and big dreams, Rupert meanders throughout life like a jaded stoner destined a life-pinnacle at a bowling alley or convenience store.  In order to get out of this rut, he concocts a plan involving an ice cream shop, a kidnapping, and more flaws than any hair-brained idea thought up on Scooby Doo.Fred Ward shines as the hard-working, traditional patriarch who deals stoically with his bonehead son.  So, minus Keanu, it's a role right up his wheelhouse.  Several bit characters comprise the rest of the cast, people whose faces are known but their names are relatively insignificant.  The odd, borderline disgusting romance between Keanu and Amy Madigan - 15 years his senior and horribly miscast - is never believable, and has about as much romance and spark as skid-marked underwear.Simply put, the movie conveys small-town life with simply problems fairly well, but none of the characters (save Fred Ward) are portrayed or written well enough to elicit anything other than contempt.  Keanu fans will enjoy this a lot more than anyone else, but otherwise it's a forgettable movie with mostly good acting and a boring plot.Jason Elin",2,Proof that Keanu has NOT changed,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1655,"['Picture', 'small', 'Pennsylvania', 'mining', 'town', 'where', 'gangly', 'doofus', 'named', 'Rupert', 'Reeves', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'stoned', 'rubs', 'everyone', 'wrong', 'way', 'irritating', 'personality', 'grating', 'speech', 'patterns', 'wait', 'was', 'kind', 'redundant.If', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Keanu', 'beforeBill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'movie', 'down', 'familial', 'struggle', 'hard-working', 'father', 'screw', 'up', 'son', 'who', 'stupid', 'haircut', 'Amidst', 'petty', 'affairs', 'big', 'dreams', 'Rupert', 'meanders', 'life', 'jaded', 'stoner', 'destined', 'life-pinnacle', 'bowling', 'alley', 'convenience', 'store', 'order', 'get', 'rut', 'plan', 'involving', 'ice', 'cream', 'shop', 'kidnapping', 'more', 'flaws', 'hair-brained', 'idea', 'thought', 'up', 'Scooby', 'Doo.Fred', 'Ward', 'hard-working', 'traditional', 'patriarch', 'who', 'stoically', 'bonehead', 'son', 'So', 'Keanu', 'role', 'right', 'wheelhouse', 'Several', 'bit', 'characters', 'comprise', 'rest', 'cast', 'people', 'are', 'known', 'names', 'are', 'relatively', 'insignificant', 'odd', 'borderline', 'disgusting', 'romance', 'Keanu', 'Amy', 'Madigan', '15', 'years', 'senior', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'never', 'believable', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'romance', 'spark', 'skid-marked', 'underwear.Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'conveys', 'small-town', 'life', 'simply', 'problems', 'fairly', 'well', 'none', 'characters', 'save', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'are', 'portrayed', 'written', 'well', 'enough', 'elicit', 'anything', 'other', 'contempt', 'Keanu', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'otherwise', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'mostly', 'good', 'acting', 'boring', 'plot.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

Unfortunately, it did not get the attention it deserves.  Those who find fault with Mr. Reeves' acting may not be enamored with his portrayal in this film.  I, however, found his approach to the character very endearing.True, there were some moments of stiffness with the acting, but once you begin to understand the character of Rupert Marshetta, perhaps the stiffness is a mode of self-protection.  It makes the character a little more relate-able once this is understood.I think anyone who hasn't quite fit in with their environment and seems to always be put in the margins of society will find something very special in this story.  I hope you give it a chance and see it anyway, regardless of the less than kind reviews.  I found this story to be heart wrenching and bitter sweet.  I can't imagine anyone other than Mr. Reeves' playing the part of Rupert.  He more than delivers the character, at times , it felt like he was genuinely playing himself.Hope this is helpful.",5,Beautiful Movie.,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,1045,"['movie', 'flew', 'radar', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'attention', 'who', 'find', 'fault', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enamored', 'portrayal', 'film', 'however', 'found', 'approach', 'character', 'very', 'endearing.True', 'were', 'moments', 'stiffness', 'acting', 'once', 'begin', 'understand', 'character', 'Rupert', 'Marshetta', 'perhaps', 'stiffness', 'mode', 'self-protection', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'relate-able', 'once', 'understood.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'environment', 'always', 'be', 'put', 'margins', 'society', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'story', 'hope', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'anyway', 'regardless', 'less', 'kind', 'reviews', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'playing', 'part', 'Rupert', 'more', 'delivers', 'character', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'genuinely', 'playing', 'himself.Hope', 'helpful']",N/A
