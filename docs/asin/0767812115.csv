She works as a drudge servant and lives a lonely life enlightened only by her love of the sea and the gifts it brings to her, including a lover in the form of a shipwrecked Slav. The villagers hate him too.  The whole village population deserves a touch of typus except for the local doctor and a well-off invalid woman who ""get"" Amy and the Slav, renamed Yanko.  They proceed to teach him English and give him a cottage, and sponsor a marriage between Amy and Yanko, even though the villagers continue to rain cruelty on the couple.  So much for the implausible and slow paced plot where you wonder how Amy always looks so angelic even though she spends the entire film in one dress and manages to have a baby without ever showing.  The value of the film is its visual beauty and the cast of extremely competent actors who have very little script with which to work.  If you are fan of the unrelieved misery of plots like Wuthering Heights and watching a passionate couple inhale misfortune, you will like this.  It's a bit of a snooze.

11030,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0767812115,Bobby Underwood,"[6, 6]","This magnificent film based on Joseph Conrad's 'Amy Foster' is filled with the timeless grace of classic literature. The Cornwall English coast has never been so beautifully photographed as it is here in this story of two hearts saving each other from a life of loneliness.Rachel Weisz uses her open and beautiful face to marvelous effect, conveying the accumulated hurt and resolve of a girl who has lived her entire life deprived of love. Her father resents her for the marriage her arrival into the world forced him into and her mother witholds her love because of a much deeper shame Amy is unaware of. Amy counters their unkindness with a silence that seems strange to those around her and casts her heart upon the sea, waiting for it to be reborn.When the sole survivor of a shipwreck washes ashore and is treated in the same manner as Amy because he is Russian and can not communicate with those around him, their hearts connect instantly. A deeply moving yet simple act of human kindness when she washes his feet and offers him bread is never to be forgotten, setting the tone for the entire film.Vincent Perez gives a perfect performance as the Russian stranger who is lost and helpless in a foreign land. It is as if the sea Amy so dearly loves has felt her hurt and brought her love. Ian McKellan and Kathy Bates also lend depth to this tender and tragic tale revolving around the sea.This film will leave you with the feeling you get upon finishing a classic book, knowing it will linger long afterward in your heart and mind. It is a deeply romantic film, spare and beautiful, laced with tenderness and love.

11041,A16Q5GMFH6PZ71,0767812115,Eliza,"[30, 42]","I would rate this movie 3.5 stars if half stars were an option. Most of the reviews have this movie rated at 5 stars so I know that puts me at odds with a majority here. I thought this was a captivating story, with gorgeous scenery shots, and marvelous casting. So why only 3.5 stars? I'm not sure if it was editing or directing but I found that the pacing and some of the shots were distracting to the point where I couldn't really become absorbed in the story or characters. A couple of the shots of Rachel Weiz staring wide eyed into the camera lasted long enough that for me it went by the effect I think the director intended. I thought even she started to look uncomfortable. The movie is slow paced through many portions, with beautiful and deliberate wide shots of people walking across fields with the ocean in the background or horse drawn carriages traveling down rustic roads. Don't get me wrong, I loved those shots. Its just that pivotal moments in the plot, such as when Amy's mother confesses who her father really is or when her things in the cave are burned, feel really rushed by comparison. These things were so briefly treated that they didn't impact me as much as they should have or give me much feeling for how they would impact the characters. Then there was the love scene in the ocean water. I grew up on an island in the Atlantic ocean at around the same latitude. After five minutes in the water even in summer your body would feel numb and your teeth would be chattering. Okay, maybe the water might be warmer there and they are in a grotto with a fire. I still think it was cold and even if not that dress she had on would weigh about 50 lbs when wet and the saltwater would be so sticky. Finally, in the last moments of the movie I really thought the next development in the Yanko/Amy saga would be their toddler aged son plunging to his death after playing unattended on the cliffs. These are my criticisms but I still think this movie is worth a watch, especially if you love the ocean. Even with the fine casting and performances of Kathy Bates and Ian McKellen the ocean is the biggest star of the film.",3,Story Pacing Off for Me,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2139,"['would', 'rate', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'half', 'stars', 'were', 'option', 'Most', 'reviews', 'have', 'movie', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'so', 'know', 'odds', 'majority', 'here', 'thought', 'was', 'captivating', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'shots', 'marvelous', 'casting', 'So', 'why', 'only', '3.5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'editing', 'directing', 'found', 'pacing', 'shots', 'were', 'distracting', 'point', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'absorbed', 'story', 'characters', 'couple', 'shots', 'Rachel', 'Weiz', 'staring', 'wide', 'eyed', 'camera', 'lasted', 'long', 'enough', 'went', 'effect', 'think', 'director', 'intended', 'thought', 'even', 'started', 'look', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'slow', 'paced', 'many', 'portions', 'beautiful', 'deliberate', 'wide', 'shots', 'people', 'walking', 'fields', 'ocean', 'background', 'horse', 'drawn', 'traveling', 'down', 'rustic', 'roads', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'loved', 'shots', 'just', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'plot', 'such', 'when', 'Amy', 'mother', 'confesses', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'when', 'things', 'cave', 'are', 'burned', 'feel', 'really', 'rushed', 'comparison', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'briefly', 'treated', 'did', ""n't"", 'impact', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'give', 'much', 'feeling', 'how', 'would', 'impact', 'characters', 'Then', 'was', 'love', 'scene', 'ocean', 'water', 'grew', 'up', 'island', 'Atlantic', 'ocean', 'same', 'latitude', 'five', 'minutes', 'water', 'even', 'summer', 'body', 'would', 'feel', 'numb', 'teeth', 'would', 'be', 'chattering', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'water', 'might', 'be', 'warmer', 'are', 'grotto', 'fire', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'cold', 'even', 'not', 'dress', 'had', 'would', 'weigh', '50', 'lbs', 'when', 'wet', 'saltwater', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'sticky', 'Finally', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'really', 'thought', 'next', 'development', 'Yanko/Amy', 'saga', 'would', 'be', 'toddler', 'aged', 'son', 'plunging', 'death', 'playing', 'unattended', 'cliffs', 'are', 'criticisms', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'watch', 'especially', 'love', 'ocean', 'Even', 'fine', 'casting', 'performances', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'ocean', 'biggest', 'star', 'film']",N/A

Barnes ""word addict""","[4, 4]","The official Amazon review of Swept from The Sea has some egregious errors that should be corrected, if merely for product representation. The review states that Yanko is a Polish salior who is considered retarded by the people of Kent. While in the Conrad's short story,Amy Foster, Yanko is a Polish salior, in the film, Yanko is a Russian highlander, who boards an immigrant ship bound for America. Also, neither in the short story nor the film is Yanko considered retarded, he is considered a madman.However, I love this film, it has been a favorite of mine since it was released 10 years ago. It was my introduction to Rachel Weisz, who captivates in a largely silent role with heart wrenching expressions and just a pure, commanding presence. This was also my introduction to Vincent Perez, who creates a great chemistry with Weisz, the earthly Yanko managing to touch and forever hold on to, the ethereal Amy, even in death.

The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable.

She is captivated by the sea and collects treasures that float up on the beach near her secret hideout/cave. For the first part of the movie, she seems to be living in a dream world. While some think she is a simpleton, others think she is a witch who can conjure storms. She has a gentle, patient, malleable nature.Often Amy (Rachel Weisz)  is found dancing in the rain or standing in a window letting the wind and rain drench her clothes. She is a child of the water and loves the rain, rivers and the ocean. She seems to drift from reality into fantasy as she twirls in the rain. In fact, it seems she dreams her true love into life. She seems to be calling to him from the cliffs of Cornwall.Yanko (Vincent Perez) arrives in Amy's village and changes her life. He is the only survivor of a shipwreck. He finds himself in a foreign land with no way to communicate with the residents. They fear strangers and almost kill him a few times before they allow him to live a normal life.Amy seems to be a naturally kind and compassionate Pices. She also seems to be in love with Yanko from the moment they gaze at one another through the kitchen window. Like two trapped animals set free, they run to each other whenever possible and share a secret world only they understand.""I'm your home and you're mine."" ~YankoWhile both Yanko and Amy seems to live at a higher level of existence, you might be shocked by the downright cruelty of many of the villagers. There is a sharp contrast between those who are accepting of Yanko and those who are willing to shun even those who talk to Yanko. Amy not only faces distain because of her quiet manner, she is also hated because she welcomes Yanko into her life. She accepts him like a gift from the sea.James Kennedy (Ian McKellen) realizes he is one of the Russian emigrants from a recent shipwreck while the rest of the village views him more cautiously. James doesn't seem to know the full story and the wounds are only healed by retelling the story to Yanko's former employer.At times this movie borders on cinematic extravagance. The widescreen edition is stunning in places. Scenes of Amy dancing in the rain in a blue haze, horses pulling carriages across vast expanses of land, trains, seascapes, ships and an abundance of lush scenery at the edge of the ocean.Being a lover of the ocean myself, I rather liked this movie. Not only is the scenery gorgeous, the score is dramatic, romantic, filled with longing and almost torturous in places.Swept from the Sea is a story of two people who have a connection to the ocean and who understand one another on the deepest levels of the soul. Most of what goes on in this movie seems to go on in your own mind. Yanko and Amy seem to almost speak to one another telepathically.
