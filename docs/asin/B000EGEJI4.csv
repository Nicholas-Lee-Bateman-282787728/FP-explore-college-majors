972462,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000EGEJI4,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[123, 141]","The West Wing's Sixth Season was certainly a step up from its disastrous fifth season, which managed to cut the show's viewership in half and nearly got the show cancelled immediately after it. The viewing public didn't particularly take to the tenser version of TWW, complete with cliched TV spots a la Third Watch: for the episode Gaza, the narrator literally intoned ""Someone from the West Wing won't be coming home."" John Wells went back to his roots, and the result was unmitigated disaster. Rarely during the Sorkin era were there genuine crises to deal with (except at the end of the season, usually). West Wing is a show that you tune into for solid drama and smart, funny dialogue, not defibrilation.Indeed, this season really proves superior to its predecessor, even though it does devolve to cheap narrative tricks at times to get people to tune in--that's right, I'm talking about making C. J. Chief of Staff when such a move in real life would make no sense, but they did get in an episode about ""who's it going to be"", and if it had been Josh, well, people would have been disappointed. After the wrapping up from the previous season, the show picks up with its story about the presidential race, even though the show's timeline is off by about a year. Initially there are a number of different candidates--for the Democrats, there's ""Bingo"" Bob Russell (Gary Cole), the replacement Vice President who might have moderate appeal but certainly has no brain; there's John Hoynes (Tim Matheson), the disgraced guy who used to have Russell's job and fancies himself a candidate, despite an adulterous scandal that involved leaking classified information. There's the Pennsylvania Governor, Baker (Ed O'Neill), who isn't in it for very long; and finally the dark horse, Texas Rep. Matthew Santos (Jimmy Smits), the moderate yet forceful unknown who eventually takes the lead. From the right, it's all Arnold Vinick (Alan Alda), who steals the show as a moderate California Senator who plays the game and manages to capture the nomination. Both the major candidates have a supporting cast: Vinick has Pamela Richardson (from Home Improvement), his wife/campaign manager, as well as the brilliant Stephen Root (from NewsRadio) as an adviser. Santos has Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), plus Teri Polo as his wife.It's undeniable that part of the reason people still watch is the wish-fulfillment factor, even though that was the point in the first place. President Bartlet was a Clinton-era wish for a White House with a strong moral compass. With the nation currently under a right-wing president who is rapidly losing the support of even his most ardent believers, Republicans can watch to see a president who does, in fact, read the newspapers and make decisions based off of facts, not his ""gut"", and Democrats can similarly find some satisfaction in a candidate who has liberal convictions and is not ashamed of what he believes, but is politically savvy enough to avoid the culture wars. However, John Wells' conservative views are more apparent here, since Vinick is the hero of the show. In fact, it is Vinick who tells a group of corn farmers during the Iowa Caucuses that he opposes ethanol, a very gutsy move that all the candidates agree with but nobody except him says. Much like Bartlet was the ideal Democratic President, Vinick is being represented as an ideal Republican Commander-in-Chief. And say what you like about TWW, it still is much better than the show ""Commander-in-Chief"".It's been said to death, but the show still ails from the departure of Aaron Sorkin. Additionally, people who tuned in only because they liked Bartlet's politics will be disappointed (although Santos is an admirable character as well). However, this season at least set up the show's final season well so that The West Wing can die with dignity instead of its last words being ""Bring it on"" as shouted by Josh to the Capitol Dome, or something said by the muppets, or ""someone will not be coming back alive."" The West Wing again becomes at least a watchable show, although one wonders if the payoff is worth the cost.",5,3.5 Stars: Back from the Dead,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,4122,"['West', 'Wing', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'was', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'disastrous', 'fifth', 'season', 'managed', 'cut', 'show', 'viewership', 'half', 'nearly', 'got', 'show', 'cancelled', 'immediately', 'viewing', 'public', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'take', 'tenser', 'version', 'TWW', 'complete', 'cliched', 'TV', 'spots', 'la', 'Third', 'Watch', 'episode', 'Gaza', 'narrator', 'literally', 'intoned', 'Someone', 'West', 'Wing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'home', 'John', 'Wells', 'went', 'back', 'roots', 'result', 'was', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'Rarely', 'Sorkin', 'era', 'were', 'there', 'genuine', 'crises', 'deal', 'end', 'season', 'usually', 'West', 'Wing', 'show', 'tune', 'solid', 'drama', 'smart', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'not', 'defibrilation.Indeed', 'season', 'really', 'superior', 'predecessor', 'even', 'devolve', 'cheap', 'narrative', 'tricks', 'times', 'get', 'people', 'tune', 'right', ""'m"", 'talking', 'making', 'C.', 'J', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'when', 'move', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'did', 'get', 'episode', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'had', 'been', 'Josh', 'well', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'wrapping', 'up', 'previous', 'season', 'show', 'up', 'story', 'presidential', 'race', 'even', 'show', 'timeline', 'year', 'Initially', 'are', 'number', 'different', 'candidates', 'Democrats', 'Bingo', 'Bob', 'Russell', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'replacement', 'Vice', 'President', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'moderate', 'appeal', 'certainly', 'brain', 'John', 'Hoynes', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'disgraced', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'have', 'Russell', 'job', 'fancies', 'candidate', 'adulterous', 'scandal', 'involved', 'leaking', 'classified', 'information', 'Pennsylvania', 'Governor', 'Baker', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'who', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'finally', 'dark', 'horse', 'Texas', 'Rep.', 'Matthew', 'Santos', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'moderate', 'yet', 'forceful', 'unknown', 'who', 'eventually', 'lead', 'right', 'Arnold', 'Vinick', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'who', 'show', 'moderate', 'California', 'Senator', 'who', 'game', 'manages', 'capture', 'nomination', 'major', 'candidates', 'have', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Vinick', 'Pamela', 'Richardson', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'wife/campaign', 'manager', 'as', 'well', 'brilliant', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'NewsRadio', 'adviser', 'Santos', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'wife.It', 'undeniable', 'part', 'reason', 'people', 'still', 'watch', 'wish-fulfillment', 'factor', 'even', 'was', 'point', 'first', 'place', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'Clinton-era', 'wish', 'White', 'House', 'strong', 'moral', 'compass', 'nation', 'currently', 'right-wing', 'president', 'who', 'rapidly', 'losing', 'support', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'believers', 'Republicans', 'can', 'watch', 'see', 'president', 'who', 'fact', 'read', 'newspapers', 'make', 'decisions', 'based', 'facts', 'not', 'gut', 'Democrats', 'can', 'similarly', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'candidate', 'who', 'liberal', 'convictions', 'not', 'ashamed', 'what', 'politically', 'savvy', 'enough', 'avoid', 'culture', 'wars', 'However', 'John', 'Wells', 'conservative', 'views', 'are', 'more', 'apparent', 'here', 'Vinick', 'hero', 'show', 'fact', 'Vinick', 'who', 'group', 'corn', 'farmers', 'Iowa', 'Caucuses', 'ethanol', 'very', 'gutsy', 'move', 'candidates', 'agree', 'nobody', 'Much', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'ideal', 'Democratic', 'President', 'Vinick', 'being', 'represented', 'ideal', 'Republican', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'say', 'what', 'like', 'TWW', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'Commander-in-Chief', '.It', 'been', 'said', 'death', 'show', 'still', 'departure', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'Additionally', 'people', 'who', 'tuned', 'only', 'liked', 'Bartlet', 'politics', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Santos', 'admirable', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'season', 'least', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'well', 'so', 'West', 'Wing', 'can', 'die', 'dignity', 'instead', 'last', 'words', 'being', 'Bring', 'shouted', 'Josh', 'Capitol', 'Dome', 'something', 'said', 'muppets', 'someone', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'alive', 'West', 'Wing', 'again', 'least', 'watchable', 'show', 'one', 'wonders', 'payoff', 'cost']",The West Wing: Season 6

972478,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000EGEJI4,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 1]","Through seasons 4 and 5, I often had the impression that the West Wing was running low on ideas.  The magic of the West Wing had been that it could make dull and complex issues interesting, and it was always presented in a more intellegent and optimistic way than by any media outlet.  Unfortunately, by season 4, the series had adopted a more ""in-your-face"" attitude and descended into partisan squabbling to drive the drama.  With Season 6, the series reinvents itself with a major shake-up of characters and focus.First, the stories.  Two events lead to the shakeup in the Bartlett administration: Leo has a heart attack, and the election primaries occur.  The former leads to C.J. being promoted from press secretary to chief of staff, while the latter leads to the losses of Josh, Donna, and Will to campaigns seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.  Of course, Bartlett isn't sitting idle - he and his remaining staff have a peace summit (Palistinian-Israeli) to deal with, a stem cell bill, alternative fuel legislation, and even an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth.  Parallel to the (often international) crises at the White House, we see the beginnings of three presidential nomination campaigns.This is where Season 6 is at its best, because we've never covered the ground before.  We see the difference between a New Hampshire primary and an Iowa caucus (and friction between citizens of those states and people from states with larger populations that are not represented in early primaries).  We see life on the road - the flesh-pressing that presidential candidates must engage in.  And we get multi-sided views on some issues, including (one dear to my own heart) ethanol as a gasoline alternative.  The science is succinct and almost always right (the only slip I noticed was Vinnick giving a child the wrong formula to find the area of a parallelogram).This brings us to the rearrangement of the old characters and the introduction of new ones.  Josh returns to his old Season 1 position (which he shared with Sam) as the central character in the ""campaign trail"" stories.  His candidate is one of the new characters, played by Jimmy Smits, as a Latino Texan aiming to be the first ""president of colour.""  Because he is a rookie, we learn through Smits how a campaign is run, and Smits does an admirable job of slowly bringing his character from wide-eyed naivete to seasoned campaigner.  At the other end of the political spectrum comes Alan Alda as the Republican nominee.  Just to say that Alan Alda plays the part of Arnold Vinnick tells all - it is a masterful performance for which he was rightfully nominated for an Emmy (he won for Season 7).  New blood in the White House is not so interesting.  While Kristin Chenoweth is very good as the new ""deputy"" press secretary, Mary McCormack is promoted to a title-sequence position in her role as a new national security advisor, and I can't understand how or why the part is needed or why McCormack was chosen for the role.  It is especially annoying that, with her arrival, there is less screen time to devote to favourite characters like Toby, Charlie (now an assistant to C.J.), or even Nancy McNally.Many were disappointed with the regime change from Sorkin to Wells.  This re-envisioning of the West Wing as parallel stories alternating between the White House and the campaign trail should re-kindle the interest of those fans, providing solid entertainment that is also intellegent.",4,The West Wing - reinvented and rejuvenated,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,3481,"['seasons', '4', '5', 'often', 'had', 'impression', 'West', 'Wing', 'was', 'running', 'low', 'ideas', 'magic', 'West', 'Wing', 'had', 'been', 'could', 'make', 'dull', 'complex', 'issues', 'interesting', 'was', 'always', 'presented', 'more', 'intellegent', 'optimistic', 'way', 'media', 'outlet', 'Unfortunately', 'season', '4', 'series', 'had', 'adopted', 'more', 'in-your-face', 'attitude', 'descended', 'partisan', 'squabbling', 'drive', 'drama', 'Season', '6', 'series', 'major', 'shake-up', 'characters', 'focus.First', 'stories', 'Two', 'events', 'lead', 'shakeup', 'Bartlett', 'administration', 'Leo', 'heart', 'attack', 'election', 'occur', 'former', 'leads', 'C.J', 'being', 'promoted', 'press', 'secretary', 'chief', 'staff', 'latter', 'losses', 'Josh', 'Donna', 'Will', 'campaigns', 'seeking', 'Democratic', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'course', 'Bartlett', ""n't"", 'sitting', 'idle', 'remaining', 'staff', 'have', 'peace', 'summit', 'Palistinian-Israeli', 'deal', 'stem', 'cell', 'bill', 'alternative', 'fuel', 'legislation', 'even', 'asteroid', 'collision', 'course', 'Earth', 'Parallel', 'often', 'international', 'White', 'House', 'see', 'beginnings', 'three', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'campaigns.This', 'where', 'Season', '6', 'best', ""'ve"", 'never', 'covered', 'ground', 'see', 'difference', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'primary', 'Iowa', 'caucus', 'friction', 'citizens', 'states', 'people', 'states', 'larger', 'populations', 'are', 'not', 'represented', 'early', 'primaries', 'see', 'life', 'road', 'flesh-pressing', 'presidential', 'candidates', 'must', 'engage', 'get', 'multi-sided', 'views', 'issues', 'including', 'one', 'dear', 'own', 'heart', 'ethanol', 'gasoline', 'alternative', 'science', 'succinct', 'almost', 'always', 'right', 'only', 'slip', 'noticed', 'was', 'Vinnick', 'giving', 'child', 'wrong', 'formula', 'find', 'area', 'parallelogram', '.This', 'rearrangement', 'old', 'characters', 'introduction', 'new', 'ones', 'Josh', 'old', 'Season', '1', 'position', 'shared', 'Sam', 'central', 'character', 'campaign', 'trail', 'stories', 'candidate', 'one', 'new', 'characters', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Latino', 'Texan', 'aiming', 'be', 'first', 'president', 'colour', 'rookie', 'learn', 'Smits', 'how', 'campaign', 'run', 'Smits', 'admirable', 'job', 'slowly', 'bringing', 'character', 'wide-eyed', 'naivete', 'seasoned', 'campaigner', 'other', 'end', 'political', 'spectrum', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Republican', 'nominee', 'Just', 'say', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'part', 'Arnold', 'Vinnick', 'masterful', 'performance', 'was', 'rightfully', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'won', 'Season', '7', 'New', 'blood', 'White', 'House', 'not', 'so', 'interesting', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'very', 'good', 'new', 'deputy', 'press', 'secretary', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'promoted', 'title-sequence', 'position', 'role', 'new', 'national', 'security', 'advisor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'why', 'part', 'needed', 'why', 'McCormack', 'was', 'chosen', 'role', 'especially', 'annoying', 'arrival', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'devote', 'favourite', 'characters', 'Toby', 'Charlie', 'now', 'assistant', 'C.J', 'even', 'Nancy', 'McNally.Many', 'were', 'disappointed', 'regime', 'change', 'Sorkin', 'Wells', 're-envisioning', 'West', 'Wing', 'parallel', 'stories', 'alternating', 'White', 'House', 'campaign', 'trail', 'should', 're-kindle', 'interest', 'fans', 'providing', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'also', 'intellegent']",The West Wing: Season 6

972507,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EGEJI4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","The difference in the style if not the substance of ""The West Wing"" in the wake of Aaron Sorkin's depature crystalized for me in the final episode of the series when I realized that Sorkin would not have simply referred to the inaugural address of the new president who replaced President Jed Barlett (Martin Sheen), he would have written it and we would have seen and heard it.  This perspective becomes useful in looking at the last couple of seasons of ""The West Wing"" because while the show never ran out of ideas regarding the wonderful world of politics, the execution of those ideas was never quite as glorious as during the first Barlett Administration.The Sixth Season of ""The West Wing"" was ambitious in two regards.  First, it started off by attempting to solve the quagmire of peace in the Middle East, at least as it applies to the tensions between Israel and the Palestinians (""The Birnam Wood"").  Then it moved on to getting an accord with China (""Impact Winter""), which would be following the lame duck game plan of trying to have an impact on international relations since everybody has stopped listening to you at home.  I found the Middle East negotiations to be tinted more with pragmatism than idealism, but while Barlett's MS problems upped the ante on his negotiations with the Chinese, the nuts and bolts of how he got the detail were hidden behind closed doors.  Certainly this added drama to the proceedings, but it also represented the tendency for significant things to happen off camera during this season.  In retrospect it seems that since Barlett now had to share time with the men competing to be his replacement that there was an effort to have him deal with real big issues.  As Barlett pointedly says, ""Progress is not good enough for me now.  I want to get something done"" (""In the Room"").Second, the show established an entire second track having to do with the primary campaign to select the Democratic nominee for the upcoming election.  That the Republican nominee is going to be Senator Arnold Vinnick (Alan Alda) is established pretty much from the moment he announces (""In the Room""), while the fact that the credit for Jimmy Smits appears right before Sheen's at the end of the title sequence in the ""with"" section gives away the outcome of the Democratic side before the last delegate vote is counted (""2162 Votes"").  I found this much more interesting than the re-election campaign from the third and fourth seasons, mainly because I knew from the start that as soon as Barlett got on stage to debate his opponent, and I was right (""Game On"").  The flaw here, again determined through the value of hindsight, is that Matt Santos wins more by default than by the merits of his education plan.  The presumptive Democratic nominee, Governor Eric Baker (Ed O'Neill) drops out, John Hoynes (Tim Mathewson) had to resign the vice presidency), and the frontrunner is ""Bingo Bob"" Russell (Gary Cole), the veep forced on Bartlett by the Republicans in Congress.  That whole machination had to do with stopping Bartlett from making his Secretary of State (William Devane) his vice president and heir presumptive, and I suppose it would be tacky for two senior administration officials to be fighting over this particular bone.  I loved the description Leo gives of Vinnick as sounding ""smarter and more honest than any Republican they've ever seen, because he is,"" but we got to see little of that because the emphasis more on what alienated Vinnick from conservatives in the Republican Party (""In God We Trust"").In addition to the newcomers Alda and Smits, the Sixth Season was defined by two other pairs of characters.  It seems strange to say that after a pair of Emmys wins for both Supporting Actress and Lead Actress that Allison Janney as C.J. Cregg emerges as a stronger character, but become Chief of Staff will do that.  The moment at the end of ""Third-Day Story"" where Bartlett asks her to jump off a cliff for him is one of my favorites from the season, but I also liked how when you go back and watch the episode again they set her up as the obvious choice for the job over Josh and Toby.  Less surprising was that once Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) got out from under Joss's wing and join the Russell campaign, she would prove to be capable of doing substantial things (like dress down a heckler in a chicken outfit in ""Freedonia"").  You also have Annabeth Schott (Kristin Chenoweth) and Kate Harper (Mary McCromack) giving women more prominent positions in the White House, making up for seeing less of Abby Barlett (Stockard Channing) and Debbie Fiderer (Lily Tomlin).  For that matter we have Helen Santos (Terri Polo) and Sheila Brooks (Patricia Richardson) making substantial appearances as well.  In contrast, Leo (John Spencer), and Charlie (Dule Hill) have less to do in the White House this year, leaving Tony Ziegler (Richard Schiff) a bit more to do.  There is also good news that Ron Silver is back as Bruno Gianelli, even though he is now working for the other side.  It also has to be said that watching Leo's heart attack in ""The Birnam Wood"" is now a chilling scene because of Spencer's death this past year.The other characters that come into their own in new ways would be Joss Lyman (Bradley Whitford) and Will Bailey (Joshua Malina), who are running competing campaigns for the presidency.  Ultimately they are more important than their candidates.  Obviously that is true about Will with running the Russell campaign, but I think it is even more true about Josh coming into his own, if only he could call down without Amy (Mary Louise Parker) having to tape him into a chair (""Freedonia"").  I have to say, as much as the Lemon Lymans would hate to hear it, give Will and Josh candidates of comparable competence to run and I think the results would be different.  Ultimately my biggest complaint about this Sixth Season is that when it comes to the primary campaign stories I wish they would show more and tell less.  If you have an entire episode about candidates getting to debate, then seeing the debate would be a good thing (this is why ""The Debate"" episode from Season Seven was so much fun and exactly what I had hoped they would have done in Season Four--yes, the election happens a year ""early"" in ""The West Wing"" universe).  There were plenty of similar opportunities to show more of the campaign and to make Santos look like more of a winning candidate, and the pattern continues throughout the rest of the campaign and the series.",4,"Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits want lame duck Martin Sheen's job on ""The West Wing""",1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,6511,"['difference', 'style', 'not', 'substance', 'West', 'Wing', 'wake',

The early, glory days seasons were filled with jubilant documentaries and the ""commentary"" tracks were insightful.  In this set the only ""extra"" of note is a terrific little documentary on the evolution of the character of Claudia Jean Craig - remembering CJ from her introductory scene where she pratfalls off the back of a treadmill to her eventual selection to succeed Leo as Chief of Staff.  Also inexcusable (given how good the prior box sets are) is lack of English subtitles.  If someone at your house is hard of hearing, better hope they can read French or Spanish.Now - to the show.  I fall in the category that considers ""West Wing"" among the best tv shows ever. Period.  I also agree that the show took a disheartening turn for the worst with the departure of creator/writor Aaron Sorkin.  This season has some excellent moments, but the moments that are not excellent are nearly painful.The season 4 finale leads President Bartlet to try to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, over the protests of everyone else, especially Leo.Later the Prez' Multiple Sclerosis acts up just in time for an historic summit in China.With a nod towards reality the show recognizes that a new President must be elected, and about half of this season is devoted to the primary process, paring down the Dems choices between VP ""Bingo Bob"" Russell, scandal-prone former VP John Hoynes, and the new ""character of substance"", Texas Representative Matthew Santos (played well by Jimmy Smits).  Unlike the great ""early years"" episodes where everyone Barlet meets falls under his spell as a candidate, Santos' greatness is only apparent to Josh, who gives his resignation to the current White House and goes off to lead the Quixotic Santos campaign. Donna has also just resigned from her position as Josh's assistant, realizing he'll never see her as much other than a secretary.  It's a little painful watching Donna and Will off stumping for empty-shirt Russell.  The Republicans are preparing to annoint Alan Alda as Senator Arnold Vinick.  Vinick must have been a liberal's dream of a Republican candidate - not aligned with the religious right and only opposed to ""partial birth"" abortions.Part of the draw of the early seasons (aside from the razor sharp Sorkin dialogue) was the ""we're-all-in-this-together"" attitude of the entire cast - and a few times I found myself wishing for the return of Sam Seaborn.Season Six only suffers in comparison to the brilliant first few seasons - sort of the way that ""Godfather III"" looks pale standing next to the first II Coppola epics.

972542,AUCHC8CJV78ER,B000EGEJI4,Sooner Matt,"[0, 1]","I've joked over the years (with fellow West Wing fans) that it might have been nice if I'd just stopped watching the show with 2 or 3 minutes left to go in the finale to Season 4 (the cliffhanger for season 4 was to much of a draw to see, and then never watch again).  The first 4 seasons were written by Aaron Sorkin.  They were smart, funny / full of wit, fast paced, and had an almost ""feel good"" quality to them.  What's more, they showed the honor and dignity that can come with public service.  Sorkin was fired at the end of Season 4, and season 5 was simply horrific.  They dumbed the show down, took out the comedy, slowed the show down, and lost all track of what the show was about.  Then came season 6.  Season 6, to me, was the season where the B team (replacing Sorkin) finally got on their feet.  The show was never going to recapture what it was for the first 4 seasons, but it could try to move on.  Season 6 was a decent attempt to move on.If you weren't into the Sorkin seasons, or did not watch them, Season 6 might seem like a nice season.  Not great, but nice.  For Sorkin fans, it would be a disappointment, but would be a huge improvement over Season 5.  At times the season suffered from pressing - i.e. solving social security in 1 episode, or solving the standoff with Cuba in 1 episode - but it was still decent entertainment.  If you got hooked by the first 4 years, you simply had to see the show through to its end.  Out of the 7 seasons, I rank this one a solid #6.  It's nowhere near the quality of seasons 1-4, not quite as good as the final season, but far, far better than Season 5.",3,"Good, but not great",1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1618,"[""'ve"", 'joked', 'years', 'fellow', 'West', 'Wing', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', ""'d"", 'just', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'left', 'go', 'finale', 'Season', '4', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '4', 'was', 'much', 'draw', 'see', 'then', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'were', 'written', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'were', 'smart', 'funny', '/', 'full', 'wit', 'fast', 'paced', 'had', 'almost', 'feel', 'good', 'quality', 'What', 'more', 'showed', 'honor', 'dignity', 'can', 'come', 'public', 'service', 'Sorkin', 'was', 'fired', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'season', '5', 'was', 'simply', 'horrific', 'dumbed', 'show', 'down', 'took', 'out', 'comedy', 'slowed', 'show', 'down', 'lost', 'track', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'Then', 'came', 'season', '6', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'B', 'team', 'replacing', 'Sorkin', 'finally', 'got', 'feet', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'recapture', 'what', 'was', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'could', 'try', 'move', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'decent', 'attempt', 'move', 'on.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'Sorkin', 'seasons', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'Season', '6', 'might', 'seem', 'nice', 'season', 'Not', 'great', 'nice', 'Sorkin', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'disappointment', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'improvement', 'Season', '5', 'times', 'season', 'suffered', 'pressing', 'i.e', 'solving', 'social', 'security', '1', 'episode', 'solving', 'standoff', 'Cuba', '1', 'episode', 'was', 'still', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'got', 'hooked', 'first', '4', 'years', 'simply', 'had', 'see', 'show', 'end', '7', 'seasons', 'rank', 'one', 'solid', '6', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'seasons', '1-4', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'final', 'season', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'Season', '5']",The West Wing: Season 6

I found this series to be quite disappointing and for the first ever time since starting to watch all of the series I found myself bored during one or two episodes. The acting is still top quality and some of the storylines manage to keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall this is a lack lustre affair. Fortunately it gains some of it's previous spark in the latter episodes but by then it feels like too little too late. This series finds the White House dealing with the fallout from the Gaza bombing and a subsequent Israeli-Palestinian summit, a full blown MS attack whist the President is on a diplomatic trip to China, flag burning, stem cell research, Cuban relations, a crisis on the International Space Station and it also follows the primary Presidential campaigns of various democrat nominees who wish to succeed Bartlett to the Oval office. The series alternates between events at the White House and out on the campaign trail and this split focus detracts from the overall strength of the series. If you are a fan of the series' then you will still enjoy watching this and as long as you aware that this is nowhere near the standard of previous outings then you shouldn't be too disappointed and can enjoy it for what it is.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,West Wing 6,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1440,"['Aside', 'glaring', 'continuity', 'error', 'previous', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '6', 'where', 'season', '5', 'left', 'off', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'first', 'ever', 'time', 'starting', 'watch', 'series', 'found', 'bored', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'acting', 'still', 'top', 'quality', 'storylines', 'manage', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'overall', 'lack', 'lustre', 'affair', 'Fortunately', 'gains', 'previous', 'spark', 'latter', 'episodes', 'then', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'series', 'White', 'House', 'dealing', 'fallout', 'Gaza', 'bombing', 'subsequent', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'summit', 'full', 'blown', 'MS', 'attack', 'whist', 'President', 'diplomatic', 'trip', 'China', 'flag', 'burning', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'Cuban', 'relations', 'crisis', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'also', 'primary', 'Presidential', 'campaigns', 'various', 'democrat', 'nominees', 'who', 'wish', 'succeed', 'Bartlett', 'Oval', 'office', 'series', 'events', 'White', 'House', 'campaign', 'trail', 'split', 'focus', 'detracts', 'overall', 'strength', 'series', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'as', 'long', 'aware', 'nowhere', 'standard', 'previous', 'outings', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', 'is.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",The West Wing: Season 6
