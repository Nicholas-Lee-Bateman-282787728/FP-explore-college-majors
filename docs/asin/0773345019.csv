Living in genteel poverty, he is intrigued by the fact that his housekeeper and her children are literate. Moved by this family who has infused some interest into his formerly desiccated life, he decides to dedicate some personal effort to educating the children.Unfortunately, he has a dark side that causes a rift in the family he seems to have adopted as his own. Alienated from the oldest son who has little interest in learning, he continues to teach the other two children. The daughter, in particular, thirsts for knowledge  and she takes to his tutoring as a duck takes to water. Consequently, she develops a deep affection for him, which he reciprocates. When he dies, he leaves her with an appreciation for education and books.After his death, however, her mother, angered by the terms of her late employer's will, forces her daughter to go into service as a laundress in a wealthy household in order to earn an income. There, the daughter's intelligence, literacy, and education causes endless trouble, both upstairs and downstairs, and class conflicts begin to raise their ugly head.  When certain  events transpire in the household that cause her to escape her drudgery, her life takes an unexpected turn, and the world soon becomes her oyster.This is a handsome production with wonderful performances by the entire cast. It is sure to delight those who enjoy period pieces, as well as those who enjoy the novels of the late Catherine Cookson.",5,A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE...,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,1917,"['international', 'award', 'winning', 'adaptation', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'should', 'delight', 'Ms.', 'Cookson', 'devoted', 'fans', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'period', 'pieces', 'class', 'conflicts', 'are', 'central', 'theme.Set', 'England', '1840s', 'desperate', 'widow', 'three', 'children', 'two', 'boys', 'girl', 'post', 'housekeeper', 'crusty', 'member', 'gentry', 'who', 'solitary', 'shabby', 'splendor', 'home', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'Living', 'genteel', 'poverty', 'intrigued', 'fact', 'housekeeper', 'children', 'are', 'literate', 'Moved', 'family', 'who', 'infused', 'interest', 'formerly', 'desiccated', 'life', 'dedicate', 'personal', 'effort', 'educating', 'children.Unfortunately', 'dark', 'side', 'rift', 'family', 'have', 'adopted', 'own', 'Alienated', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'little', 'interest', 'learning', 'teach', 'other', 'two', 'children', 'daughter', 'particular', 'thirsts', 'knowledge', 'tutoring', 'duck', 'water', 'Consequently', 'deep', 'affection', 'When', 'appreciation', 'education', 'books.After', 'death', 'however', 'mother', 'angered', 'terms', 'late', 'employer', 'will', 'forces', 'daughter', 'go', 'service', 'laundress', 'wealthy', 'household', 'order', 'earn', 'income', 'daughter', 'intelligence', 'literacy', 'education', 'causes', 'endless', 'trouble', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'class', 'conflicts', 'begin', 'raise', 'ugly', 'head', 'When', 'certain', 'events', 'transpire', 'household', 'escape', 'drudgery', 'life', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'world', 'soon', 'oyster.This', 'handsome', 'production', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'sure', 'delight', 'who', 'enjoy', 'period', 'pieces', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'enjoy', 'novels', 'late', 'Catherine', 'Cookson']",N/A

Her mother was employed in these large country homes, cleaning these houses and being very underpaid and overworked [also the ''work houses'' in England were dreaded by the working classes..Charlie Chaplans fans will remember only too well] so her description was from not only what her mother told her but from first hand accounts and seeing the plight of so many who were employed under the worst conditions that she came to know about these things first hand...It was shocking, very sad and must have been totally depressing for the many who had to endure under horrendous conditions not only to feed themselves and their children, but having to put up with loathsome owners who abused them in so many ways...I  am from Northumberland in England, [the cold frozen north] I grew up there and already knew a lot of the storieswhich my mother told...stories first hand and stories passed down...[there was such incredibly poverty..Miss Cookson and her mother were a part of that]There is also a great deal of written information about Miss Cookson, and the area which is called ''Cookson Country''...I have always thought of the intolerable conditions and situations that she and her mother had to endure..It is so amazing that in later life [my family knew her] she was so incredibly kind and generous, and I feel a credit to her generation...I  have been thrilled with the adaptations of her books...and highly recommend them...Amazingly, she knew how to write and her stories I think are an incredible witness to the horrendous conditions for those 'domestics' during that period..",5,a review on Catherine Cookson,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,1995,"['adore', 'Catherine', 'Cooksons', 'books', 'one', 'exception..The', 'mood', 'feelings', 'total', 'lack', 'abject', 'poverty', 'are', 'captured', 'so', 'well', 'especially', 'single', 'mother', 'children', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'children', 'serve', 'master', 'order', 'completely', 'understand', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'have', 'know', 'amazing', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cruel', 'lived', 'such', 'poverty', 'mother', 'was', 'employed', 'large', 'country', 'homes', 'cleaning', 'houses', 'being', 'very', 'underpaid', 'overworked', '[', 'also', 'work', 'houses', 'England', 'were', 'dreaded', 'working', 'classes..Charlie', 'Chaplans', 'fans', 'will', 'remember', 'only', 'too', 'well', ']', 'description', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'mother', 'told', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'seeing', 'plight', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'employed', 'worst', 'conditions', 'came', 'know', 'things', 'first', 'hand', 'was', 'shocking', 'very', 'sad', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'depressing', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'endure', 'horrendous', 'conditions', 'not', 'only', 'feed', 'children', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'loathsome', 'owners', 'who', 'abused', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'am', 'Northumberland', 'England', 'cold', 'frozen', 'north', ']', 'grew', 'up', 'there', 'already', 'knew', 'lot', 'storieswhich', 'mother', 'told', 'stories', 'first', 'hand', 'stories', 'passed', 'down', '[', 'was', 'such', 'incredibly', 'poverty..Miss', 'Cookson', 'mother', 'were', 'part', ']', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'written', 'information', 'Miss', 'Cookson', 'area', 'called', 'Cookson', 'Country', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'intolerable', 'conditions', 'situations', 'mother', 'had', 'endure..It', 'so', 'amazing', 'later', 'life', '[', 'family', 'knew', ']', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'kind', 'generous', 'feel', 'credit', 'generation', 'have', 'been', 'thrilled', 'adaptations', 'books', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Amazingly', 'knew', 'how', 'write', 'stories', 'think', 'are', 'incredible', 'witness', 'horrendous', 'conditions', ""'domestics"", 'period..']",N/A
