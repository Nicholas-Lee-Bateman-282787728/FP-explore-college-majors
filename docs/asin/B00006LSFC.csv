I`m only 39 but since I knew Tom Jones style and voice, I was captured by his unique presence.

If you are not sure if you like Tom Jones that much, or not, then its still a must purchase because by the time you've watched this incredible show, you will know he is THE BEST male vocalist in the world!  His true abilities were evident way back in the 1960's, however, it has taken years for him to gain the respect of music critics and others I suspect because of his sexy dancing and grinding, that make the ladies go wild.  His voice is the true show however....Check out ""Without Love"", ""A Boy From Nowhere"" or ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" if you want a display of power and ability that no one else can touch.",5,Simply the best there is....,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,679,"['are', 'Jones', 'fan', 'then', 'DVD', 'must', 'purchase', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'much', 'not', 'then', 'still', 'must', 'purchase', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'incredible', 'show', 'will', 'know', 'BEST', 'male', 'vocalist', 'world', 'true', 'abilities', 'were', 'evident', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'however', 'taken', 'years', 'gain', 'respect', 'music', 'critics', 'others', 'suspect', 'sexy', 'dancing', 'grinding', 'make', 'ladies', 'go', 'wild', 'voice', 'true', 'show', 'however', 'Love', 'Boy', 'From', 'Nowhere', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Again', 'want', 'display', 'power', 'ability', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'touch']",N/A

I'm sure that this was a great live show and we would have loved to be there.  He can still sing great and put on a good show but the way they film so many of these events leave a lot to be desired.  I wonder what is wrong with just filming the show and letting people watch it without all of the quick cuts and weird angles.  I don't want to watch the crowd.

Great performances, many hits, excellent musicians and Tom in top form. But these endless camera moves are pointless and make me feel dizzy, especially with a large screen. Impossible to follow a musician or Tom himself because the point of view is always changing. It must be fun for the editor to change angles at all the times, but that person must be the only one to enjoy it ! Too bad this editing style has now become fashionable.

I am not sure what following he has, maybe more in England and Europe than the united states but he can for sure sing.  Really enjoyed his take on some newer songs and really gave new life to them.
