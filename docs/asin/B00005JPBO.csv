648526,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPBO,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[8, 9]","Spirited and inspiring, `We Are Marshall' takes the tragic plane crash that killed nearly every member of the football team and coaching staff at Marshall University and makes it into a living memorial. Taking place in 1970, the town of Huntington, WV is found in a state of shock. Key members of the tragedy are focused upon, including #59, Griffin, whose father, Paul (Ian McShane) is a college head and whose fianc&eacute;, Annie (Kate Mora, `Brokeback Mountain') is grieving. Besides team leader Nicky and a few other lucky team survivors, Red Dawson, the assistant coach (Matthew Fox) missed the flight when his recruiting duties called for him to take a car home. The college president Donald Dedmon (David Straitharn) understandably wants to throw in the towel, but Nicky won't stand for it. When Dedmon calls a private session to vote to cancel football, Nicky cleverly sends for people to come to demonstrate on the mall of the campus. His heart keeps all perseverance alive. After many attempts to keep a license from the NCAA and to recruit a coaching staff, Dedmon finally finds a recruit, an outsider, Jack Lengyel, (Matthew McCaugnahey) who has the color and spunk to fire up a football team from the ashes. He finally convinces, consoles, and cajoles those who are in shell-shock, in grief, and in survivors' guilt--including the reluctant Red--to stick with the program.With great music pumping into the scenes, we get the determination to follow the seeds of rejuvenation. That is until the first game takes a nosedive and everyone involved starts to second-guess the timing of starting over. Then the movie takes a long time-out to reflect on matters a while. Lengyel, who was inspired to take over despite the results, at least has the winning message. (What the results are I won't tell, even for those who know the whole story.) The characters are lively and likable, and the story is told in a riveting way. Inspiring, 'We Are Marshall' makes us all want to be Marshall in our own way. It is a movie with great heart and bursting with passion. The movie will make you want to cheer and be willing to take your handkerchief through the whole nine yards.",4,Heart and Determination Propel 'Marshall',1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2174,"['Spirited', 'inspiring', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'tragic', 'plane', 'crash', 'killed', 'nearly', 'member', 'football', 'team', 'coaching', 'staff', 'Marshall', 'University', 'living', 'memorial', 'Taking', 'place', '1970', 'town', 'Huntington', 'WV', 'found', 'state', 'shock', 'Key', 'members', 'tragedy', 'are', 'focused', 'including', '59', 'Griffin', 'father', 'Paul', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'college', 'head', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Annie', 'Kate', 'Mora', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'grieving', 'Besides', 'team', 'leader', 'Nicky', 'few', 'other', 'lucky', 'team', 'survivors', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'assistant', 'coach', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'missed', 'flight', 'when', 'recruiting', 'duties', 'called', 'take', 'car', 'home', 'college', 'president', 'Donald', 'Dedmon', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'understandably', 'throw', 'towel', 'Nicky', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'When', 'Dedmon', 'private', 'session', 'vote', 'cancel', 'football', 'Nicky', 'cleverly', 'people', 'come', 'demonstrate', 'mall', 'campus', 'heart', 'perseverance', 'alive', 'many', 'attempts', 'keep', 'license', 'NCAA', 'recruit', 'coaching', 'staff', 'Dedmon', 'finally', 'recruit', 'outsider', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'McCaugnahey', 'who', 'color', 'spunk', 'fire', 'up', 'football', 'team', 'ashes', 'finally', 'consoles', 'cajoles', 'who', 'are', 'shell-shock', 'grief', 'survivors', 'guilt', 'including', 'reluctant', 'Red', 'stick', 'program.With', 'great', 'music', 'pumping', 'scenes', 'get', 'determination', 'follow', 'seeds', 'rejuvenation', 'first', 'game', 'nosedive', 'everyone', 'involved', 'starts', 'second-guess', 'timing', 'starting', 'Then', 'movie', 'long', 'time-out', 'reflect', 'matters', 'while', 'Lengyel', 'who', 'was', 'inspired', 'take', 'over', 'results', 'least', 'winning', 'message', 'What', 'results', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'even', 'who', 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'lively', 'likable', 'story', 'told', 'riveting', 'way', 'Inspiring', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'want', 'be', 'Marshall', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'great', 'heart', 'bursting', 'passion', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'cheer', 'be', 'willing', 'take', 'handkerchief', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards']",N/A

648529,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B00005JPBO,a gentle sound,"[1, 2]","There are a lot of times when great leadership has mattered. In West Virginia a sports program is more than sports. It is the life blood of a people.It's the embodiment, at its best, of the people of a state that have suffered under the indignity, and the denigration of supplying to this nation with her blood and toil her energy ""needs"" (seemingly to expand to this then ungrateful bloated beast.) It is in the poverty of West Virginia, in her beautiful hills,  I was able to grow up and be ever free in the calm simple majesty of a place that has had to bear the brunt too often of national mocking. But not really on a fair field of play.  It's funny how much she's shown us really in her sports.My Dad, I recall him talking to me during this game shown here at film's culmination, the game the ""day after."" As Marshall ""went on."" In his way saying to me, this was a great tragedy of these boys, it was wordless. So many lost, so long ago, lost on an ill fated flight, all lost Marshall players. In this film that awful time (and how it was faced) is immortalized. I actually looked for myself in the footage of a game re-enacted, laughing at the mistake of that after a few moments of great family teasing. The game shown is symbolic of them putting things back together and finding a way to go on through the leadership of this good coach that went into this and tried.I grew up able (because of Coach Catlett) to meet and enjoy some awesome WVU games and people in her sports halls of fame. Not understanding fully then how cool it was for me.Nothing was quite like the loss of the Marshall team, even very young we understood that was something that stopped a state in its tracks, potentially very numbing. Hearing of this movie I thought that I'd never watch it. How could anyone? I don't know how those from that time intimately involved made it through then or now dry eyed. It was so tear jerking.But I did just finish the game. Opps, movie.  I am taken with what it says to us, shows of leadership. We face times now that West Virginians have long known.Now too in differing circumstances we Need those able to put aside their enrichment to make lives matter, focus on dreams that are not symbolized with getting the next Humveee, to focus on the heart. That place, Marshall has real heart. My half-sister went there, just graduating. It is a good school, and this is a winner film about the rebuilding of their team after a catastrophic loss. I can't believe it was made.They went forward. Showing the people of that time for who they were in the moment. It gives credits many just didn't give then to many good people. And could it really ever say enough about that loss?It took me back. It was acted, filmed, made as a tribute and it captures the people and the times. I'm glad here before the Superbowl I saw it.It lifted me up on a day I find I cannot get out of bed for wishing we could channel this kind of spirit, to the place I love, my saddening world.It gives in it's frames a filmatic reason to face the worst and run forward toward the goal.",5,Rare look at Leadership,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3067,"['are', 'lot', 'times', 'when', 'great', 'leadership', 'mattered', 'West', 'Virginia', 'sports', 'program', 'more', 'sports', 'life', 'blood', 'people.It', 'embodiment', 'best', 'people', 'state', 'have', 'suffered', 'indignity', 'denigration', 'supplying', 'nation', 'blood', 'toil', 'energy', 'needs', 'seemingly', 'expand', 'then', 'ungrateful', 'bloated', 'beast', 'poverty', 'West', 'Virginia', 'beautiful', 'hills', 'was', 'able', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'ever', 'free', 'calm', 'simple', 'majesty', 'place', 'had', 'bear', 'brunt', 'too', 'often', 'national', 'mocking', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'field', 'play', 'funny', 'how', 'much', 'shown', 'really', 'sports.My', 'Dad', 'recall', 'talking', 'game', 'shown', 'here', 'film', 'culmination', 'game', 'day', 'Marshall', 'went', 'way', 'saying', 'was', 'great', 'tragedy', 'boys', 'was', 'wordless', 'So', 'many', 'lost', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'ill', 'fated', 'flight', 'lost', 'Marshall', 'players', 'film', 'awful', 'time', 'how', 'was', 'faced', 'immortalized', 'actually', 'looked', 'footage', 'game', 're-enacted', 'laughing', 'mistake', 'few', 'moments', 'great', 'family', 'teasing', 'game', 'shown', 'symbolic', 'putting', 'things', 'back', 'together', 'finding', 'way', 'go', 'leadership', 'good', 'coach', 'went', 'tried.I', 'grew', 'up', 'able', 'Coach', 'Catlett', 'meet', 'enjoy', 'awesome', 'WVU', 'games', 'people', 'sports', 'halls', 'fame', 'Not', 'understanding', 'fully', 'then', 'how', 'cool', 'was', 'me.Nothing', 'was', 'quite', 'loss', 'Marshall', 'team', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'understood', 'was', 'something', 'stopped', 'state', 'tracks', 'potentially', 'very', 'numbing', 'Hearing', 'movie', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'watch', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'time', 'intimately', 'involved', 'made', 'then', 'now', 'dry', 'eyed', 'was', 'so', 'tear', 'jerking.But', 'did', 'just', 'finish', 'game', 'Opps', 'movie', 'am', 'taken', 'what', 'leadership', 'face', 'times', 'now', 'West', 'Virginians', 'have', 'long', 'known.Now', 'too', 'differing', 'circumstances', 'Need', 'able', 'put', 'aside', 'enrichment', 'make', 'lives', 'matter', 'focus', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'symbolized', 'getting', 'next', 'Humveee', 'focus', 'heart', 'place', 'Marshall', 'real', 'heart', 'half-sister', 'went', 'there', 'just', 'graduating', 'good', 'school', 'winner', 'film', 'rebuilding', 'team', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'made.They', 'went', 'forward', 'Showing', 'people', 'time', 'who', 'were', 'moment', 'credits', 'many', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'then', 'many', 'good', 'people', 'could', 'really', 'ever', 'say', 'enough', 'loss', 'took', 'back', 'was', 'acted', 'filmed', 'made', 'tribute', 'people', 'times', ""'m"", 'glad', 'here', 'Superbowl', 'saw', 'it.It', 'lifted', 'up', 'day', 'find', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'bed', 'wishing', 'could', 'channel', 'kind', 'spirit', 'place', 'love', 'saddening', 'world.It', 'filmatic', 'reason', 'face', 'worst', 'run', 'forward', 'goal']",N/A

648534,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPBO,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 11]","When you strip away the sentiment that clouds this movie (due to the fact that the horrific events serving as the films foundation are true) then you start to see this film for what it is; a generic sports film.  There is absolutely nothing special and or new to separate this film from the rest of the pack, and honestly it is no where near as good as most other sports related dramas.  Yes, it has an emotional wallop that will endear this film to a lot of people, but if the title of `true story' were taken away then this film would have no where near the fan base it has now.The film focuses on the town of Marshall West Virginia.  When the entire football team (minus a few players) dies in a horrific plane crash an aspiring football coach from out of town comes down to pick up the pieces of the now barely there football team.  Jack Lengyel faces a lot of opposition in his attempt to rebuild the Marshall Football team, but his efforts are not in vain for it is through the power of the game that the town is able to heal wounds and unite once again.Like I said, not much separates this film from any other random sports drama out there, and there are a lot of them.  I lacks the emotional impact that it could have had, even with the devastating circumstances that litter the films every frame.  In all honestly I found `Friday Night Lights' to have a much stronger emotional connection to the audience than this film.  The sub-plot involving the father and ex-fianc&eacute; of one of the deceased is rather touching and heartbreaking, but overall the film cannot reach the heights it is so desperately trying to grasp.The acting is hit or miss for me.  Matthew McConaughey is seriously one of the worst actors making money today.  I never really understood his appeal (aside from his body).  I mean, why is he booking big ticket movies?  He pulls off the same semi-charming performance in each film yet never manages to make his performance `mean' anything.  This is probably his best `acting' performance to date; sadly it is also his most annoying.  He actually creates a character here but the character he creates is one I wish he had never attempted.  The way he walks, talks and interacts with others is painful to watch.  Matthew Fox is rather boring here, as is Strathairn, and Anthony Mackie is just a really bad actor.  I haven't seen him do anything noteworthy yet (aside from getting his face smashed in by Freeman in `Million Dollar Baby').  The two actors who actually pull their weight here are Kate Mara and Ian McShane, but even they lack consistency.  At times Mara's pain comes off forced and McShane's reclusive nature plays on the clich&eacute;d, but in the end they make a much deeper connection to the audience than anyone else involved with the project.I won't say that `We Are Marshall' is a bad film, but I must declare it is far from a great one.  Fact remains that this is nothing new and thus should not be regarded as such.  It feels very familiar because it pays close heed to follow the same formula almost every sports related drama uses.  If you want to watch a film about the town of Marshall and the tragedy that befell them then by all means, watch this film; but if you are just looking for a sports film then you are bound to find more satisfying fare elsewhere.",3,Feels very tired and unoriginal...,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,3313,"['When', 'strip', 'away', 'sentiment', 'movie', 'due', 'fact', 'horrific', 'events', 'serving', 'films', 'foundation', 'are', 'true', 'then', 'start', 'see', 'film', 'what', 'generic', 'sports', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'special', 'new', 'separate', 'film', 'rest', 'pack', 'honestly', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'other', 'sports', 'related', 'dramas', 'Yes', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'will', 'endear', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'title', 'true', 'story', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'where', 'fan', 'base', 'now.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'town', 'Marshall', 'West', 'Virginia', 'When', 'entire', 'football', 'team', 'few', 'players', 'horrific', 'plane', 'crash', 'aspiring', 'football', 'coach', 'town', 'down', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'now', 'barely', 'football', 'team', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'lot', 'opposition', 'attempt', 'rebuild', 'Marshall', 'Football', 'team', 'efforts', 'are', 'not', 'vain', 'power', 'game', 'town', 'able', 'heal', 'wounds', 'unite', 'once', 'said', 'not', 'much', 'separates', 'film', 'other', 'random', 'sports', 'drama', 'there', 'are', 'lot', 'lacks', 'emotional', 'impact', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'even', 'devastating', 'circumstances', 'litter', 'films', 'frame', 'honestly', 'found', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'have', 'much', 'stronger', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'film', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'father', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'one', 'deceased', 'rather', 'touching', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'heights', 'so', 'desperately', 'trying', 'grasp.The', 'acting', 'hit', 'miss', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'seriously', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'making', 'money', 'today', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'appeal', 'aside', 'body', 'mean', 'why', 'booking', 'big', 'ticket', 'movies', 'same', 'semi-charming', 'performance', 'film', 'yet', 'never', 'make', 'performance', 'mean', 'anything', 'probably', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'date', 'sadly', 'also', 'most', 'annoying', 'actually', 'character', 'here', 'character', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'attempted', 'way', 'talks', 'interacts', 'others', 'painful', 'watch', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'rather', 'boring', 'here', 'Strathairn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'actor', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', 'anything', 'noteworthy', 'yet', 'getting', 'face', 'smashed', 'Freeman', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'actually', 'pull', 'weight', 'here', 'are', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'even', 'lack', 'consistency', 'times', 'Mara', 'pain', 'off', 'forced', 'McShane', 'reclusive', 'nature', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'end', 'make', 'much', 'deeper', 'connection', 'audience', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'project.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'bad', 'film', 'must', 'declare', 'far', 'great', 'one', 'Fact', 'nothing', 'new', 'thus', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'regarded', 'such', 'very', 'familiar', 'close', 'heed', 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'almost', 'sports', 'related', 'drama', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'town', 'Marshall', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'sports', 'film', 'then', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'more', 'satisfying', 'fare', 'elsewhere']",N/A

It was very difficult, and through plenty of emotional scenes, they'll eventually make moving on a reality.They also did a spectacular job with the choice of rock songs from that time period, such as Cat Stevens, Black Sabbath and Crosby Stills and Nash.Just a really incredible film that will move you on several occasions.

648540,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00005JPBO,Bill Garrison,"[1, 1]","WE ARE MARSHALL, directed by McG (what kind of name is that?) is a great movie that captures the incredible tragedy of the plain that, in 1970, killed so many members of the Marshall football community. The movie then attempts to capture the struggle of the decision to resume the football program and of the difficulty in putting the past behind and pushing forward with life. People affected directly by the tragedy will have a different opinion about the movie that the rest of America that only knows of the Marshall plane crash in passing.You can really divide the movie into two parts. First, the plane crash, the victims, and those left behind to cope with the loss. Second, standared sports movie where team overcomes obstacles to prevail. I truly believe the creators of this movie tried their best to create a factual yet entertaining movie about the Marshall tragedy. The film can't follow all of the sad stories, so it chooses a few characters to focus on and has them be representative of the entire town. The film opens as Marshall loses a tough road game. We see the hurt by another loss yet proud of his team. We see the star running back kissing his fiance (played by Kate Mara, who is also the narrator of the movie) goodbye as he catches the plane and she gets in a car to return home. There is Nate Ruffin, team captain, who didn't make the trip because of the injury. Coach Red Dawson (played by Lost's Matthew Shepard) tells another coach to take his seat on the plane so he can get home to see his daughter's piano recital. Dawson takes a car home, and thus misses out on the crash only by chance. The film sets up a group of characters quickly and they all connect with the audience.Then the plane crashes right before arrival. The crash is close enough that people in the town can see the site. The President Dedmon of Marshall (played by David Straitharn) is a timid man forced to take a leadership position. He is ready to cancel the football team but a show of support from the student body forces him to change his mind. He has a horrible time finding a coach until one man, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) shows interest in the job.The movie shifts here to focus on Lengyel trying to form a football team while facing so many obstacles. The team doesn't have enough players so the school finally gets the NCAA to allow freshmen to play (this wasn't allowed at the time). The coaches fight many recruiting battles and win a few. They finally make it to the season and the movie concludes with the team's first home game.I think it would be almost impossible to capture what the town went through during these tragic times. But WE ARE MARSHALL does a great job of  portraying the sadness of the entire community and the incredible spirit that it took to embrace the new football team and honor those who lost their lives. The acting in this movie is solid, especially Fox and McConaughey. I recommend this movie to all sports fans and those interested in the history of the tragedy at Marshall. This movie honors the victims as well is the spirit of the school.",5,Incredible story of the tragic Marshall plane crash and the struggle to recover,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,3092,"['WE', 'ARE', 'MARSHALL', 'directed', 'McG', 'what', 'kind', 'name', 'great', 'movie', 'incredible', 'tragedy', 'plain', '1970', 'killed', 'so', 'many', 'members', 'Marshall', 'football', 'community', 'movie', 'then', 'capture', 'struggle', 'decision', 'resume', 'football', 'program', 'difficulty', 'putting', 'past', 'behind', 'pushing', 'forward', 'life', 'People', 'affected', 'directly', 'tragedy', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'movie', 'rest', 'America', 'only', 'Marshall', 'plane', 'crash', 'passing.You', 'can', 'really', 'divide', 'movie', 'two', 'parts', 'First', 'plane', 'crash', 'victims', 'left', 'cope', 'loss', 'Second', 'standared', 'sports', 'movie', 'where', 'team', 'obstacles', 'prevail', 'truly', 'believe', 'creators', 'movie', 'tried', 'best', 'create', 'factual', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Marshall', 'tragedy', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'sad', 'stories', 'few', 'characters', 'focus', 'be', 'representative', 'entire', 'town', 'film', 'Marshall', 'tough', 'road', 'game', 'see', 'hurt', 'loss', 'yet', 'proud', 'team', 'see', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'kissing', 'fiance', 'played', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'movie', 'goodbye', 'plane', 'car', 'return', 'home', 'Nate', 'Ruffin', 'team', 'captain', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'trip', 'injury', 'Coach', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'played', 'Lost', 'Matthew', 'Shepard', 'coach', 'take', 'seat', 'plane', 'can', 'get', 'home', 'see', 'daughter', 'piano', 'recital', 'Dawson', 'car', 'home', 'thus', 'out', 'crash', 'only', 'chance', 'film', 'up', 'group', 'characters', 'quickly', 'connect', 'audience.Then', 'plane', 'crashes', 'right', 'arrival', 'crash', 'close', 'enough', 'people', 'town', 'can', 'see', 'site', 'President', 'Dedmon', 'Marshall', 'played', 'David', 'Straitharn', 'timid', 'man', 'forced', 'take', 'leadership', 'position', 'ready', 'cancel', 'football', 'team', 'show', 'support', 'student', 'body', 'change', 'mind', 'horrible', 'time', 'finding', 'coach', 'one', 'man', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'interest', 'job.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'here', 'focus', 'Lengyel', 'trying', 'form', 'football', 'team', 'facing', 'so', 'many', 'obstacles', 'team', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'players', 'school', 'finally', 'NCAA', 'allow', 'freshmen', 'play', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'time', 'coaches', 'fight', 'many', 'recruiting', 'battles', 'win', 'few', 'finally', 'make', 'season', 'movie', 'team', 'first', 'home', 'game.I', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'capture', 'what', 'town', 'went', 'tragic', 'times', 'WE', 'ARE', 'MARSHALL', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'sadness', 'entire', 'community', 'incredible', 'spirit', 'took', 'embrace', 'new', 'football', 'team', 'honor', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'acting', 'movie', 'solid', 'especially', 'Fox', 'McConaughey', 'recommend', 'movie', 'sports', 'fans', 'interested', 'history', 'tragedy', 'Marshall', 'movie', 'victims', 'well', 'spirit', 'school']",N/A

He captures the hollow, lonely feeling of a heartbroken town with just quiet scenes in a local cafe.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 3]","I had never heard of Marshall University until that chartered plane went down in the West Virginia foothills in the autumn of 1970.  I recall how very sad I was upon hearing of this tragedy, and I wondered how the school--how the town that nurtured it--would recover. . .or if it would ever recover.  So when I learned of this film, I became intrigued; either WE ARE MARSHALL would fall flat on its face as superficial and phony, or it would effectively pay a poignant, lasting tribute to the school, to Huntington, and to those who played a part in restoring its football program.I've never seen any footage of head coach Jack Lengyel, but based on Matthew McConaughey's quirky, eccentric behavior in his portrayal of the man called upon to rebuild Marshall's program, Lengyel is clearly one in a million.  McConaughey is funny, a tad odd, and wonderfully inspiring; he is totally believable as a head coach working through the trials and tribulations of putting together a staff, hanging on to the few players who didn't make the fateful trip, and recruiting dozens of new players.  I've seen several films featuring this actor, and this is by far his best role.Yet WE ARE MARSHALL features several exceptional performances, including Anthony Mackie as cornerback and team captain Nate Ruffin.  Missing the ill-fated flight due to injury, Nate was devastated by the tragedy, yet determined to lead the fight to get another team back on the field as soon as possible.  Also noteworthy is David Straithairn as humble, soft-spoken school President Don Dedmon, a man just a bit in over his head in dealing with the NCAA for permission to allow freshmen to play.  Ian McShane and Matthew Fox cause a few tears to fall, too.This film brings back the Seventies in all its vibrant, gaudy colors, augmented by a slick musical score that restores an avalanche of memories.  And finally, WE ARE MARSHALL boasts one of the most moving cinematic scenes ever--when Marshall's student body confronts a board of governors voting to suspend the football program.  You will really feel chills racing up and down your spine, and a lump in your throat, yet compelled to stand up and cheer this inspirational, exceptional movie.--D.

648557,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00005JPBO,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","This movie is based on a true story.  In 1971, a charter plane carrying the entire Marshall university football team + the coaching staff and trainers crashed.  There were no survivors.  It was a tragedy that shook the entire nation in a way that the United State would not experience again until the shootings @ VA Tech a few yrs ago.In the aftermath, there was much consternation as to whether Marshall would even continue its football program - at least in the near-term.  Enter an eccentric coach (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey) who finds that he must literally rebuild a football program.  I'm not talking a typical rebuilding program where a coach takes over  a losing program & has very few good players to work with.  Rather, I'm talking about rebuilding a program which lacks the actual PLAYERS.Even more importantly, the new coach is tasked with lifting the spirits of the team, the students of the university & the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia.  In this way, this is one of those films in which sports can transcend the travails of life & become a metaphor.This is one of the more powerful sports movies I've ever seen.  What makes it more poignant than a great many sports flicks is the fact that it actually happened - there is nothing in the film that can be said to be contrived.

I wouldn't like to know the person who can sit through the first half hour of this movie and not be moved to the core of his being. It brings out every loss and every moment of grief that anyone has ever felt. In one searing moment of loss every one in this town lost close friends, lovers, admired leaders,neighbors,a whole team of athletic heroes, parents, children,and everything that forms the heart of town. And all are killed by the most horrible way known to man - burned to death. Six of the athletes were so totally destroyed that they could not be identified and had to be buried under a single monument.This movie is only slightly about football, It is mostly about how people handle grief and somehow  move on with their lives and rebuild their world.It has no happy ending. The new team does not move on the first year to become league champions. They do manage to win one game, and that is where the movie ends. The real victory lies in that the town does not give in to the grief that is still present, but decides to honour their dead by continuing the football tradition even though they know that it will be many years before they can have a winning team.Sentimental people should have a full box of kleenex handy. Just when you think the sad part is over, something happens to tear your heart open all over again, just the way it happens in life.Although this movie brought back the memories of moments of overwhelming grief in my own life, I am not sorry I watched it.  By showing how these people handled the grief in their lives, it gave me lessons on how to handle the grief in my own.I reccommend this movie to every adult in the english-speaking world, but do not expect to come away unscathed.

Instead it was a double.Okay, stupid baseball references aside, the story is compelling enough. The setting was done real well and a lot of the supporting acting was great. The plot either got short on material at the point the reformed team is playing again or the screenwriter lacked in the delivery of a climactic ending. Also, worth mentioning is McConaughey does a poor job evoking emotional support, in the role of the fill-in football coach. He is just too damn quirky to be the underdog hero. McShane is great, though...As you know, the movie is based on the tragic plane crash that wipes out the entire Marshall University football program. The resulting emotions, survivor guilt etc., plague the entire town, never mind the student body. Then, the team is reformed due to the enthusiasm of a replacement coach. Up to this point, the movie is very good. Then, as you would expect, the emotions should build until the knockout punch is delivered. It never happens. Several attempts are made to ratchet the anxiety, such as the formulaic cemetery scene, but it just seems to fizzle. The eventual team win just fizzles too. It's too bad.Anyway, this is a rental, not a purchase.

You might be amazed at what you can sometimes find there. It's an interesting way to chose late night movies, if you know what you're doing. This time I picked out three movies and one was ""We Are Marshall"" (Full Screen Edition). It was the tragic story of a late 1970 plane crash killing 75 people, most of whom were the Marshall University football team and coaches on their way back from a game with East Carolina University. The crash wiped out almost the entire football program.I've been a college football follower ever since my undergraduate days at the University of Colorado and I remember the tragic crash well. I also remember that Marshall decided to rebuild the program and have a team playing the regular schedule the following 1971 season. Most people would have said it was impossible. Well, I knew nothing of the details, but they did it and even managed to win a couple games. This movie attempts to document that rebuilding feat. It's part fiction and part fact. I suppose you could call it a docudrama. It's a good movie, without question! You might best understand it if you knew a little about football, but it's not really necessary to have any great depth. It's a very tragic story, but is very uplifting at the same time. The acting is good. The story is well done. The photography is excellent.

648574,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JPBO,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 7]","In the fall of 1970, tragedy struck the Thundering Herd of Marshall football team.  Returning from a road football game, the team's plane crashed.  Seventy-five people, including the entire football team, coaching staff, and some fans were killed.  Marshall was left without a football team.  This fine film describes the rebirth of the Marshall football program after this terrible tragedy.In the months after the crash, the university struggled with the idea of whether or not to continue the football program.  Most of the board of trustees wanted to suspend the program.  But university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) wasn't convinced.  When star varsity player Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) organizes a student body rally outside of the boardroom, Dedmon is convinced that the program must continue.All of the coaches on Dedmon's list turns down the offer of becoming Marshall's new head coach.  But, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) has heard of Marshall's plight.  Jack contacts the University himself and expresses interest in the job.  Dedmon drives to Jack's house to interview him and soon, Jack is introduced as Marshall's new coach.  The problem is, Jack has no staff and only three returning players.Jack's first duty is to hire a coaching staff.  His first hire is Red Dawson (Matthew Fox).  Red was on the previous coaching staff and was not on the plane when it crashed.  The next step is to find players.  The NCAA had a rule which stated that no true freshmen could play football.  But Jack begged Donald to persuade the NCAA to make an exception for Marshall.  Several letters and phone calls to the NCAA led nowhere.  Finally, at Jack's request, Donald drove to the NCAA offices in Kansas City.  He returned with a letter stating that freshmen could play for Marshall's team.  Now, Jack had to build his team.Marshall was competing against some other big-time college programs, most notably West Virginia University, for players.  Missing out on all of the top recruits, Jack and his staff are forced to play with mostly fresmen, walk-ons, and the few remaining varsity players.  The early results were not pretty, but Jack preached patience and hard work.  Leaders began to emerge.Soon, the team was ready for its first game, which turned out to be a decisive defeat.  But Jack kept his players practicing hard and believing in themselves.  The next week, the Herd faced off in their home opener against Xavier University.  The contest was close throughout, but in the end, Marshall prevailed on a last-second touchdown.  The long road back for the Thundering Herd had begun.Over the ensuing years, Marshall's team slowly began the climb to respectability.  First, a winning season was accomplished in the early 80s.  Next, in the 90s, a series of future NFL stars played for Marshall, including Randy Moss, Chad Pennington, and Byron Leftwich.  Two National Titles rounded out Marshall's resurgence.Simply put, this is a fantastic movie.  David Strathairn, Matthew Fox, and Anthony Mackie are all very good in their roles, but this movie belongs to Matthew McConaughey.  He does a masterful job of portraying a head coach who faced nearly insurmountable odds and yet put a group of young men together and made them a team.  His performance is truly one of the best I've seen.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story is poignant, yet uplifting at the same time.  The acting is first-rate, and the game sequences are exciting to watch.  If you're a fan of football or just plain old stories about overcoming adversity, then this movie is for you.  You'll want to stand and cheer.",5,Play Until the Whistle Blows,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,3628,"['fall', '1970', 'struck', 'Thundering', 'Herd', 'Marshall', 'football', 'team', 'Returning', 'road', 'football', 'game', 'team', 'plane', 'crashed', 'Seventy-five', 'people', 'including', 'entire', 'football', 'team', 'coaching', 'staff', 'fans', 'were', 'killed', 'Marshall', 'was', 'left', 'football', 'team', 'fine', 'film', 'rebirth', 'Marshall', 'football', 'program', 'terrible', 'months', 'crash', 'university', 'struggled', 'idea', 'not', 'continue', 'football', 'program', 'Most', 'board', 'trustees', 'wanted', 'suspend', 'program', 'university', 'president', 'Donald', 'Dedmon', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'When', 'star', 'varsity', 'player', 'Nate', 'Ruffin', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'student', 'body', 'rally', 'boardroom', 'Dedmon', 'convinced', 'program', 'must', 'continue.All', 'coaches', 'Dedmon', 'list', 'down', 'offer', 'becoming', 'Marshall', 'new', 'head', 'coach', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'heard', 'Marshall', 'plight', 'Jack', 'University', 'interest', 'job', 'Dedmon', 'Jack', 'house', 'interview', 'soon', 'Jack', 'introduced', 'Marshall', 'new', 'coach', 'problem', 'Jack', 'staff', 'only', 'three', 'returning', 'players.Jack', 'first', 'duty', 'hire', 'coaching', 'staff', 'first', 'hire', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Red', 'was', 'previous', 'coaching', 'staff', 'was', 'not', 'plane', 'when', 'crashed', 'next', 'step', 'find', 'players', 'NCAA', 'had', 'rule', 'stated', 'true', 'freshmen', 'could', 'play', 'football', 'Jack', 'begged', 'Donald', 'persuade', 'NCAA', 'make', 'exception', 'Marshall', 'Several', 'letters', 'phone', 'calls', 'NCAA', 'led', 'nowhere', 'Finally', 'Jack', 'request', 'Donald', 'drove', 'NCAA', 'offices', 'Kansas', 'City', 'returned', 'letter', 'stating', 'freshmen', 'could', 'play', 'Marshall', 'team', 'Now', 'Jack', 'had', 'build', 'team.Marshall', 'was', 'competing', 'other', 'big-time', 'college', 'programs', 'most', 'notably', 'West', 'Virginia', 'University', 'players', 'Missing', 'out', 'top', 'recruits', 'Jack', 'staff', 'are', 'forced', 'play', 'mostly', 'fresmen', 'walk-ons', 'few', 'remaining', 'varsity', 'players', 'early', 'results', 'were', 'not', 'pretty', 'Jack', 'preached', 'patience', 'hard', 'work', 'Leaders', 'began', 'emerge.Soon', 'team', 'was', 'ready', 'first', 'game', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'decisive', 'defeat', 'Jack', 'kept', 'players', 'practicing', 'hard', 'believing', 'next', 'week', 'Herd', 'faced', 'off', 'home', 'opener', 'Xavier', 'University', 'contest', 'was', 'close', 'end', 'Marshall', 'prevailed', 'last-second', 'touchdown', 'long', 'road', 'back', 'Thundering', 'Herd', 'had', 'ensuing', 'years', 'Marshall', 'team', 'slowly', 'began', 'climb', 'respectability', 'First', 'winning', 'season', 'was', 'accomplished', 'early', '80s', 'Next', '90s', 'series', 'future', 'NFL', 'stars', 'played', 'Marshall', 'including', 'Randy', 'Moss', 'Chad', 'Pennington', 'Byron', 'Leftwich', 'Two', 'National', 'Titles', 'rounded', 'out', 'Marshall', 'resurgence.Simply', 'put', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'movie', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'head', 'coach', 'who', 'faced', 'nearly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'yet', 'put', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'together', 'made', 'team', 'performance', 'truly', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'story', 'poignant', 'yet', 'uplifting', 'same', 'time', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'game', 'sequences', 'are', 'exciting', 'watch', ""'re"", 'fan', 'football', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'stories', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'then', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'stand', 'cheer']",N/A

It starts simply enough with the hours before & during an away game. The movie rolls into that horrible moment & the aftermath. It became a national story. The school & the city of Huntington, West Virginia were devastated. The relationship between the city & the school was very close & small town America. The first impulse was to cancel the next season. The whole varsity save two members who didn't make the trip were dead. A list was made of men associated with Marshall to fill the head coaching job. Nobody came forward. But a small time coach from Ohio with no ties to Marshall came forward & applied for the job. In desperation he was hired. That was Jack Lengyel, played by Matthew McCanaughey.He made it clear that he intended to field a team, no matter whose feelings got hurt. They got a waiver from tha NCAA to play freshman for next season. The balance of the movie covers that year of struggles just to play, much less to win even one game, against bigger, stronger & older opponents. A story like this must have pathos. But we are not burdened by it or bogged down. A father & the sweetheart of a player share their grief. An assistant coach who had recruited 20 of the players is emotionally shattered & a player who overslept & missed the plane is racked with guilt. These hit just the right mix. Perhaps, an outsider, like coach Jack was needed to pull it all together. But in the end he also became part of Marshall.",4,Little pretense here.

Outside of West Virginia, it became a lost story for years.  I am glad the film rekindled that memory for me, because the tale of what happened to the town of Huntington, and Marshall University, is one that should never be forgotten.  The film depicts the tragedy very respectfully, as the plane crash is not actually shown.  What takes place afterward is a story of rebuilding, healing, and inspiration, not only in terms of football but of life in general.  Everyone reacts differently to movies, and this one really struck an emotional chord with both my wife and myself, so much so that after seeing it we became Thundering Herd fans.  Since the film came out we have traveled to Huntington annually to pay respects and see a game, and based upon our experiences in doing so we can attest to the fact that the good folks of that town are as warm and hospitable as they are depicted on the screen.  We can also attest that the tragedy of November 14, 1970 still resonates greatly with those people today.

The mood is solemn as the townsfolk can't seem to shake this bad feeling that the tragedy put upon this town and the school.As the immediate future of the Marshall football program is unknown, a man named Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey ""Sahara"") decides to step in and become the coach of the team just months after this event took place. He takes the charge of coaching a bunch of inexperienced players who basically have zero chance to win any games for the upcoming season. But that doesn't mean they won't try their best, grow as human beings and become men on the field and in life.Sports movies themselves are a mixed bag, usually the cliches can wear down even the coolest of sports moments the filmmakers capture, but with ""We Are Marshall"" it is truly one of the best modern sports movies. The football action is quite well done, the acting especially by McConaughey is very convincing and while yes it is cliche and anyone who knows the story knows the team didn't do well, it is easily one of the most touching and inspiring sports flicks I've seen in quite some time.The opening scenes with the football game vs. East Carolina and those leading to and immediately after the crash do set the tone for the rest of the movie. At least director McG (The Charlie's Angel's movies) actually doesn't go heavy handed with anything or over the top like some of his previous directing ventures. One of the other good performances in this flick is by David Strathairn (""Good Night & Good Luck"") who always shines with this type of material.I agree with what most people have said after viewing this, that if you're not inspired by this film then there's something wrong with you.

648589,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPBO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 7]","""We are Marshall"" is the true story of what happened when a chartered plane crashed just short of the airport in Huntington, West Virginia on November 14, 1970, wiping out the varsity football team for Marshall University.  Having to replace virtually the entire team and coaching staff, university President Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) hires Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), who is not a Marshall alum, but who thinks that he can help a team, school, and community devastated by the tragedy.  The story ends a year later, when the Thundering Herd play their first home game of the season.  While watching this true story play out it might occur to you that this inspirational story reaches its climax when Marshall played in its first game under Lengyel the week before, because just fielding a team again is a major achievement, but ""We Are Marshall"" stays faithful to the genre it represents and represents well.In many ways the most emotional part of the movie is the opening half-hour, that starts with the end of the final football game at East Carolina and plays out the rest of that fateful Saturday.  In depicting the plane crash, the film's director McG gives us bits and pieces of the moment of realization for those who will be touched by this disaster as the news breaks.  Wide shots of the forest on fire contrast with the downpour in which a wife learns that her husband was not on the plane.  Inspirational movies of this sort are intended to provoke strong emotions if not tears, but rarely is the first act as emotionally powerful as it is in this 2006 film.  The plane crash was not some place far, far away, but on the outskirts of town.  The students and townsfolk not only got to see the rescue vehicles streaming to the crash sight, they also got to go and see the fiery wreckage in the woods for themselves (at least they do in this film).The other main characters in this film are those touched hardest by the tragedy.  Matthew Fox plays Red Dawson, the assistant coach who gave up his seat on the plane at the last moment, Ian McShane is Paul Griffen, the father of the team's star running back, and Kate Mara is Annie Cantrell, who was engage to Griffen's son.  One of the things I respected about this film is that not everyone is able to walk back into Marshall's football stadium for the big game, let alone be healed by the final credits.  Far and away the most compelling character in the entire film is Anthony Mackie's Nate Ruffin, the star defensive back who stayed in Huntington because of an injured shoulder.  It is Ruffin who organizes the students to keep the football program and who wants to keep playing despite re-injuring his shoulder time and time again.  His motivation seems unique, because Ruffin wants his team back, and it is Ruffin who is the heart of the Young Thundering Herd.There are moments where the comic relief elements of the film run against the grain a bit too much for my taste; McConaughey's Jack Lengyel comes across as a bit of a bozo early on and there is a sense in which we do not get to the ""real"" him until his big speech before the Young Thundering Herd's first home game the season after the tragedy.  But then a running gag involving West Virginia University, which keeps getting all of the recruits that Lengyel and his coaches have on their board, takes a nice twist, and I have to admit that there needs to be some levity in telling story.  Furthermore, as much as I hate slow motion for big plays in sports movies, I really like the way McG intercuts flashes from all that has happened in this film into that moment, and the wonderful way that history and drama are intermixed during the final credits.  For my money, ""We are Marshall"" is one of the better inspirational sports movies in some time.",5,The story of the Young Thundering Herd from tragedy to triumph,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,3785,"['are', 'Marshall', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'chartered', 'plane', 'crashed', 'just', 'short', 'airport', 'Huntington', 'West', 'Virginia', 'November', '14', '1970', 'wiping', 'out', 'varsity', 'football', 'team', 'Marshall', 'University', 'Having', 'replace', 'virtually', 'entire', 'team', 'coaching', 'staff', 'university', 'President', 'Donald', 'Dedmon', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'not', 'Marshall', 'alum', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'team', 'school', 'community', 'devastated', 'tragedy', 'story', 'year', 'later', 'when', 'Thundering', 'Herd', 'play', 'first', 'home', 'game', 'season', 'watching', 'true', 'story', 'play', 'might', 'occur', 'inspirational', 'story', 'climax', 'when', 'Marshall', 'played', 'first', 'game', 'Lengyel', 'week', 'before', 'just', 'fielding', 'team', 'again', 'major', 'achievement', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'faithful', 'genre', 'well.In', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'emotional', 'part', 'movie', 'opening', 'half-hour', 'end', 'final', 'football', 'game', 'East', 'Carolina', 'out', 'rest', 'fateful', 'Saturday', 'depicting', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'director', 'McG', 'bits', 'pieces', 'moment', 'realization', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'disaster', 'news', 'breaks', 'Wide', 'shots', 'forest', 'fire', 'contrast', 'downpour', 'wife', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'plane', 'Inspirational', 'movies', 'sort', 'are', 'intended', 'provoke', 'strong', 'emotions', 'not', 'tears', 'rarely', 'first', 'act', 'emotionally', 'powerful', '2006', 'film', 'plane', 'crash', 'was', 'not', 'place', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'outskirts', 'town', 'students', 'townsfolk', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'see', 'rescue', 'vehicles', 'streaming', 'crash', 'sight', 'also', 'got', 'go', 'see', 'fiery', 'wreckage', 'woods', 'least', 'do', 'film', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'touched', 'hardest', 'tragedy', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'assistant', 'coach', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'seat', 'plane', 'last', 'moment', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Paul', 'Griffen', 'father', 'team', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Annie', 'Cantrell', 'who', 'was', 'engage', 'Griffen', 'son', 'One', 'things', 'respected', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'able', 'walk', 'back', 'Marshall', 'football', 'stadium', 'big', 'game', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'healed', 'final', 'credits', 'Far', 'away', 'most', 'compelling', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Nate', 'Ruffin', 'star', 'defensive', 'back', 'who', 'stayed', 'Huntington', 'injured', 'shoulder', 'Ruffin', 'who', 'students', 'keep', 'football', 'program', 'who', 'keep', 'playing', 're-injuring', 'shoulder', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'motivation', 'unique', 'Ruffin', 'team', 'back', 'Ruffin', 'who', 'heart', 'Young', 'Thundering', 'Herd.There', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'comic', 'relief', 'elements', 'film', 'run', 'grain', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'taste', 'McConaughey', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'across', 'bit', 'bozo', 'early', 'sense', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'real', 'big', 'speech', 'Young', 'Thundering', 'Herd', 'first', 'home', 'game', 'season', 'tragedy', 'then', 'running', 'gag', 'involving', 'West', 'Virginia', 'University', 'getting', 'recruits', 'Lengyel', 'coaches', 'have', 'board', 'nice', 'twist', 'have', 'admit', 'there', 'be', 'levity', 'telling', 'story', 'Furthermore', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'slow', 'motion', 'big', 'plays', 'sports', 'movies', 'really', 'way', 'McG', 'flashes', 'happened', 'film', 'moment', 'wonderful', 'way', 'history', 'drama', 'are', 'intermixed', 'final', 'credits', 'money', 'are', 'Marshall', 'one', 'better', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'movies', 'time']",N/A

Quido ""quidrock""","[38, 40]","I remember clearly, as a high school junior, the shock and loss that the crash of the aircraft carrying the Marshall University football team invested on a nation. The town, the college, and those left behind must have suffered so. It has taken 25 years to portray that loss on film, and the December film, ""We Are Marshall"", while not living up to its promise as one of the years ""awardable"" movies, was nevertheless a moving film experience.The film deals briefly with the events leading up to the crash, and then in depth with the different ways that those affiliated with the school grieve and start over again. Star athlete Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) is stunned at the fact that he wasn't on the plane, due to injury, and that his legacy is to pick up where the team left off and start over again. His faith in that new start never waivers. Unlike Ruffin, the school's administration and its president Donald Dedmon (the always excellent David Strathairn)are more realistic. They can't recruit, can't play freshman, can't rebuild right away. The school is small and although ""The Thundering Herd"" were important to students, alumni and faculty alike, the task is insurmountable. They will suspend the program for a few years to give everyone a chance to recover.The student body has a different plan, and their outrage presents Dedmon with the need to try. He can't find a coach and has to settle for a virtual unknown from the College of Wooster. Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey, complete with greasy hair in an unlikely length and clothes of plaid polyester) accepts the challenge He's just savvy and stubborn enough to make it work, to reformat and refashion a team of sorts, and even to talk former recruiting scout, Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) into returning as an assistant coach.The remainder of the film deals with both the practical matter of building the team, the difficulty in winning, and the way those in the town and at the school deal with the grief of what might have been.Director McG, not a favorite of mine (he brought us BOTH Charlie's Angel's films) surprises with his light touch with the story and his ability to let the film find its own legs. It is a poignant tale. It bogs down between the decision to move forward with the team and the actual first game. The game sequences have an authentic feel, and the score moves well with the film. The film feels like authentic West Virginia and authentic 70's. It never attempts to be something it isn't; it's a sports film that treats the sport within the greater landscape of what was happening in the times and how emotions sometimes get in the way of moving on with your life. It deeply affected the crowd in the theater on the day I saw it.McConaughey is goofy, offbeat and believable as Lengyel. Aside from his performance, everyone else in the film works well together as an ensemble, with few false notes but not much to remember about their contributions. There's no cliche here, just a simple story that will make you both sad and hopeful.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[2, 2]","I highly recommend watching this beautiful, inspiring and incredibly sad film about a town in West Virginia that lost its college football team and most of the coaches in a horrific plane crash and how an outsider helped them rebuild and keep the spirits of the lost players alive.In 1970, after losing a game to an East Carolina University, the Thundering Herd boarded their chartered plane to head home. Assistant Coach Red Dawson gave up his seat so one of the team's recruiters could get home to see his granddaughter's recital. They were so close to home and I'm not really sure from watching the film why but the plane crash landed into an inferno a mile short of the runway. There were no survivors. Seventy-five people died.Many thought that was the end of the football program at Marshall University but a union of students and townspeople convinced President Dedmon he had to give it a go at building up a team that meant so much to this small town. His first job was to find a new coach but no one wanted to take on what was really a no-win situation. Then one day he receives a call from Jack Lengyel, a strange but honest coach from an obscure town who wanted to see what he could do to help the people of Huntington heal. With the help of surviving coach Red Dawson and the remaining senior players they set about building up a team from nothing.I would have liked to learned more about the past and replacement players. I felt the only real player we got to know was Nate Ruffin the Captain. But I understand there's only so much that can be committed to a 1 1/2 - 2 hour film. Regardless it is still highly charged with emotion and you are sure to be cheering from within: We are, Marshall!This film is about hope, grieving, rebuilding and the unity of a town brought together by the sport of football. Notable performances include Matthew Mcconaughey as Coach Jack Lengyel, Matthew Fox as Coach Red Dawson, David Strathairn as President Dedmon, Anthony Mackie as Nate Ruffin and Kate Mara as Annie Cantrell (who also affectionately narrates).",4,"beautiful, inspiring and incredibly sad",1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,2059,"['highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'film', 'town', 'West', 'Virginia', 'lost', 'college', 'football', 'team', 'most', 'coaches', 'horrific', 'plane', 'crash', 'how', 'outsider', 'helped', 'rebuild', 'keep', 'spirits', 'lost', 'players', 'alive.In', '1970', 'losing', 'game', 'East', 'Carolina', 'University', 'Thundering', 'Herd', 'boarded', 'chartered', 'plane', 'head', 'home', 'Assistant', 'Coach', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'gave', 'up', 'seat', 'so', 'one', 'team', 'recruiters', 'could', 'get', 'home', 'see', 'granddaughter', 'recital', 'were', 'so', 'close', 'home', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'watching', 'film', 'why', 'plane', 'crash', 'landed', 'inferno', 'mile', 'short', 'runway', 'were', 'survivors', 'Seventy-five', 'people', 'died.Many', 'thought', 'was', 'end', 'football', 'program', 'Marshall', 'University', 'union', 'students', 'townspeople', 'convinced', 'President', 'Dedmon', 'had', 'give', 'go', 'building', 'up', 'team', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'small', 'town', 'first', 'job', 'was', 'find', 'new', 'coach', 'one', 'wanted', 'take', 'was', 'really', 'no-win', 'situation', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'call', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'strange', 'honest', 'coach', 'obscure', 'town', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'help', 'people', 'Huntington', 'heal', 'help', 'surviving', 'coach', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'remaining', 'senior', 'players', 'set', 'building', 'up', 'team', 'nothing.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'learned', 'more', 'past', 'replacement', 'players', 'felt', 'only', 'real', 'player', 'got', 'know', 'was', 'Nate', 'Ruffin', 'Captain', 'understand', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'committed', '1', '1/2', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'Regardless', 'still', 'highly', 'charged', 'emotion', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'cheering', 'are', 'Marshall', 'film', 'hope', 'grieving', 'rebuilding', 'unity', 'town', 'brought', 'together', 'sport', 'football', 'Notable', 'performances', 'include', 'Matthew', 'Mcconaughey', 'Coach', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Coach', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'President', 'Dedmon', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Nate', 'Ruffin', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'Annie', 'Cantrell', 'who', 'also', 'affectionately']",N/A

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","The 2006 film ""We Are Marshall"", directed by McG, is a story based upon a true & tragic event: the November 14, 1970 crash of an airliner resulting in the deaths of nearly the entire football team of Marshall University along with nearly the entire coaching staff and many other victims.  Only a handful of team members were not on board, including Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) and Tom Bogdan (Brian Geraghty).  With the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia in mourning following the crash, Nate organizes the students to rally the school's board to continue the football program rather than suspend it as Paul Griffen (Ian McShane), head of the board, wants to do because his son Chris (Wes Brown) was killed in the crash.  However, Paul Griffen and university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) relent and decide to continue the program.  After many failed attempts at finding a new football coach, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) of the University of Wooster applies for the job and gets it.  Under his leadership, he and one of the original coaching staff, Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), train a new team comprised of almost all freshmen as the new Marshall University football team.This film, which is a tribute to the football team that died in 1970, the students of Mashall University, Jack Lengyel, Nate Ruffin and the new freshmen football team of 1971, is an emotional, engaging & well-written film.  With wonderful cinematography, a gripping story and moving characters, ""We Are Marshall"" deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

Now, 36 years later, I've been able to catch up on this piece of history.WE ARE MARSHALL is a poignant story of the tragedy and how it affected so many lives. The most glaring thing that this movie accomplishes is to portray how the event was not limited to the families of those who perished, but stirred a whole campus, a whole community, and even a whole country, and how that same tragedy even touches the lives of people today through the Marshall University legacy.The movie itself is very well cast and historically accurate. I believe the profound, underlying message here, as displayed over and over in life, is that humanity is at it's best when situations are at their worst. That same holds true whether facing battle situations, terrorists attacks, or the loss of a college football team. Unlike so many events that Hollywood feels the need to add its own brand of romance, drama or heroics, the producers were able to present the story accurately without the need for embellishment.This is not an easy movie to watch and will send the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster, but is definitely worth the ride. The acting is good, the soundtrack is good, the script is good, even the wardrobe is good, although McConaughey and Fox should have shaved. In 1970, men either had beards or they were clean shaven.

The university and its town are crippled by the loss and want to suspend the football program at the school. However, a small number of remaining players organize a student protest to keep the game alive at Marshall.After many fruitless phone calls, the university president (Strathairn) finds a new coach - Jack Lengyel (McConaughey). Lengyel convinces former assistant coach Red Dawson (Fox) to return, and the NCAA grants the university the right to play freshmen. Lengyel and Dawson then fill their team with new recruits and begin playing football again.This movie is based on a true story, and I became misty-eyed more than once as I watched it. Performances are very good, and though the cast boasts several ""stars,"" I thought the best depiction in the film was given by Anthony Mackie. Mackie plays Nate Ruffin, one of the remaining football players. Ruffin was not at the away game due to an injury. It is his determination to keep the football program going that makes it a reality. He had some wonderful scenes with McConaughey and Fox, and, in my opinion, he walked off with the movie.Other than one scene that seemed rather pushed to me (Lengyel's speech at the graveyard where the victims of the crash are buried; I didn't buy it. I don't know if it was the writing or the delivery, but it came off as maudlin and strained.), this movie is right on target.

I believe one such reviewer called it a ""tired plot.""To those wise enough to recogize what is happening though, the movie is about how a town, a university, and many individuals experienced the five stages of grief as a result of the true event that killed a university football team and many community leaders.  The five states of grief are (1) denial and isolation, (2) Anger, (3)Bargaining, (4) Depression, and (5) Acceptance.  I thought the film makers did an incredible job of showing how each stage was dealt with both individually and communally.Tied into the grief recovery of all involved is the effort of one outsider coach who believes he can help everyone through the process, accepting the challenge of adversity he knew would be universally omnipresent.  His belief, effort, and result is truly inspirational.""Grief is messy......It can make you do things you'll regret.""

The way in which the film makers presented this sequence of events made the tragedy palpable. It's to their credit, that no sensationalized special effects or morbid recreations were used during or after the crash. The full grievous effects were still felt by the viewer due to the  touching  introduction of the players, the fans, and the overall small town U.S.A. atmosphere that this college, this town, and the players shared. This is ""NOT""  a football movie, but there is football in the movie.As sad as the loss of lives, are the tortured souls of the people spared by fate, most notably two injured players who didn't make the trip and an assistant coach  Red Dawson, who at the last minute before boarding the doomed flight, volunteered to stay behind and make a recruiting call in the place of another  assistant coach, so the other coach could get home to see one of his children's  piano recital.One of the most touching scenes of human decency in the film, is when the new head coach, Jack Lengyel and Red, were having a tough time getting the new team's ""veer"" offense  running the following year, so Jack came up with the unheard of idea, of going to see their in-state rival West Virginia University's coach Bobby Bowden, and ask for some advice. Bobby at first couldn't believe the ""chutzpah"" of Jack, but then said; ""Well we don't play you this year!"" And then led the two Marshall coaches to his film room and said go ahead. While they were in there, two West Virginia players accidently came into the film room, and when they turned around to leave the Marshall coaches saw that painted on the back of the West Virginia University football helmets were ""MU"" and a ""CROSS"". The impact of that stunning scene brings tears to your eyes and a pang in your heart. At that moment Coach Bobby Bowden walks in and Jack says barely audible; ""IT'S FIRST CLASS COACH! FIRST CLASS!""And that's the best thing I can say about this movie; ""IT'S FIRST CLASS!""",5,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""A SPECTRUM OF EMOTIONS IN THIS TRUE-LIFE SAGA!""",1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2150,"['November', '14', '1970', 'plane', 'carrying', 'Marshall', 'University', 'Football', 'team', 'coaches', 'fans', 'crashed', 'way', 'back', 'game', 'East', 'Carolina', 'University', 'killing', '75', 'people', 'way', 'film', 'makers', 'presented', 'sequence', 'events', 'made', 'tragedy', 'palpable', 'credit', 'sensationalized', 'special', 'effects', 'morbid', 'recreations', 'were', 'used', 'crash', 'full', 'grievous', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'felt', 'viewer', 'due', 'touching', 'introduction', 'players', 'fans', 'overall', 'small', 'town', 'U.S.A.', 'atmosphere', 'college', 'town', 'players', 'shared', 'NOT', 'football', 'movie', 'football', 'movie.As', 'sad', 'loss', 'lives', 'are', 'tortured', 'souls', 'people', 'spared', 'fate', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'injured', 'players', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'trip', 'assistant', 'coach', 'Red', 'Dawson', 'who', 'last', 'minute', 'boarding', 'doomed', 'flight', 'volunteered', 'stay', 'make', 'recruiting', 'call', 'place', 'assistant', 'coach', 'other', 'coach', 'could', 'get', 'home', 'see', 'one', 'children', 'piano', 'recital.One', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'human', 'decency', 'film', 'when', 'new', 'head', 'coach', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Red', 'were', 'having', 'tough', 'time', 'getting', 'new', 'team', 'veer', 'offense', 'running', 'following', 'year', 'Jack', 'came', 'up', 'unheard', 'idea', 'going', 'see', 'in-state', 'rival', 'West', 'Virginia', 'University', 'coach', 'Bobby', 'Bowden', 'ask', 'advice', 'Bobby', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'chutzpah', 'Jack', 'then', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'year', 'then', 'led', 'two', 'Marshall', 'coaches', 'film', 'room', 'said', 'go', 'ahead', 'were', 'there', 'two', 'West', 'Virginia', 'players', 'accidently', 'came', 'film', 'room', 'when', 'turned', 'around', 'leave', 'Marshall', 'coaches', 'saw', 'painted', 'back', 'West', 'Virginia', 'University', 'football', 'helmets', 'were', 'MU', 'CROSS', 'impact', 'stunning', 'scene', 'tears', 'eyes', 'pang', 'heart', 'moment', 'Coach', 'Bobby', 'Bowden', 'walks', 'Jack', 'barely', 'audible', 'IT', 'FIRST', 'CLASS', 'COACH', 'FIRST', 'CLASS', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'IT', 'FIRST', 'CLASS']",N/A

But more than the loss of the people, the town lost its shining star, the football team.""We Are Marshall"" covers the aftermath of the crash, as the team is built back by new coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey).  Sadly, the writers felt the compelling stories that grew naturally from the events needed to be Hollywoodized.  Some scenes lack authenticity and scream film cliche (everyone in town drives to the crash site and gets within a hundred feet of the burning plane, ""bad guys"" don't want the program to continue, the entire student body marches on the administration building to get the team back, etc).  The film's more poignant moments really happened, including a great scene with then West Virginia head coach Bobby Bowden helping the Marshall coaches learn their offense and a sobering moment where two funeral processions actually meet at an intersection in the days after the crash.Had the film remained true to the story and stayed away from the manufactured drama,  this could have been one of the finest sports films ever made.  But even with its flaws, the heart of this film is in the right place.  It gets right the most important points concerning the ripple effects of the tragedy in the small town.  The people of Huntington are honestly displayed, as is their pain, hope and belief.",4,Historical inaccuracies can be forgiven because of film's heart,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2061,"['small', 'city', 'Huntington', 'West', 'Virginia', 'college', 'football', 'team', 'more', 'weekly', 'distraction', 'toil', 'daily', 'life', 'team', 'town', 'sense', 'worth', 'community', 'Appalachian', 'coalfields', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'feel', 'swallowed', 'up', 'outside', 'world', 'Other', 'schools', 'have', 'more', 'money', 'bigger', 'programs', 'greater', 'fame', 'school', 'more', 'townsfolk', 'Marshall', 'Thundering', 'Herd.So', 'more', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'plane', 'crash', 'took', 'football', 'team', 'away', 'town', 'lost', 'part', 'addition', 'players', 'coaches', 'town', 'lost', 'more', 'half', 'doctors', 'many', 'prominent', 'members', 'community', 'who', 'were', 'plane', 'passengers', 'boosters', 'program', 'more', 'loss', 'people', 'town', 'lost', 'shining', 'star', 'football', 'team', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'aftermath', 'crash', 'team', 'built', 'back', 'new', 'coach', 'Jack', 'Lengyel', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Sadly', 'writers', 'felt', 'compelling', 'stories', 'grew', 'naturally', 'events', 'needed', 'be', 'Hollywoodized', 'scenes', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'scream', 'film', 'cliche', 'everyone', 'town', 'drives', 'crash', 'site', 'hundred', 'feet', 'burning', 'plane', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'program', 'continue', 'entire', 'student', 'body', 'marches', 'administration', 'building', 'get', 'team', 'back', 'etc', 'film', 'more', 'poignant', 'moments', 'really', 'happened', 'including', 'great', 'scene', 'then', 'West', 'Virginia', 'head', 'coach', 'Bobby', 'Bowden', 'helping', 'Marshall', 'coaches', 'learn', 'offense', 'sobering', 'moment', 'where', 'two', 'funeral', 'processions', 'actually', 'meet', 'intersection', 'days', 'crash.Had', 'film', 'remained', 'true', 'story', 'stayed', 'away', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'finest', 'sports', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'flaws', 'heart', 'film', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'most', 'important', 'points', 'concerning', 'ripple', 'effects', 'tragedy', 'small', 'town', 'people', 'Huntington', 'are', 'honestly', 'displayed', 'pain', 'hope', 'belief']",N/A

648634,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPBO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","At its core, this film tells the story of the Marshall College football program of 1971, when a year earlier nearly the entire team was wiped out in a plane crash and thus the entire team had to be rebuilt.  Sadly, this is a true story, and this film is able to capture the essence of the entire story in two ways:First, not only is the building of the football team extremely difficult, but more importantly was the rebuilding of the community after the tragedy, and director McG captured that emotional period brilliantly, showing how members of the school and community grappled with the issue of putting a team on the field (and risk dredging up bad memories) or scrapping the football program altogether.  While some people yearn to see the green and white colors on the playing field, others are haunted by those memories and would prefer to keep them at an arms length, the conflict that provides the emotional punch to the film.Just as important, however, is the quality of the acting.  Matthew McConaughey breaks away from his traditional ""brainless"" or ""hunk"" movie roles to portray Coach Jack Lengyl, who brought football back to Marshall.  McConaughey nails this role, bringing the enigmatic coach to life.  Also impressive is Kata Mara in the role of Annie Cantrell, whose personal struggles mirror the struggles of the entire community.  However, it is Matthew Fox (""Jack"" of LOST fame) who really steals the show.  Playing a Marshall coach not on the doomed plane, Fox is brilliant in portraying the conflicting emotions (relief, sorrow, regret, anger, guilt, etc.) that arise from such a complicated, emotional situation.  It has been a long time since I have seen an actor be so good at playing emotionally conflicted characters.Overall, this is a very inspirational, yet also quite sorrowful film that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Yet, even in its most emotional moments, there always seems to exist a light at the end of the tunnel, or a way that things can start to be okay after such a tragedy.  Though you likely already know how the situation turned out, that knowledge will not stop you for rooting on the Marshall boys all the same!",5,A MUST WATCH For All Sports (Especially Football) Fans,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,2174,"['core', 'film', 'story', 'Marshall', 'College', 'football', 'program', '1971', 'when', 'year', 'earlier', 'nearly', 'entire', 'team', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'plane', 'crash', 'thus', 'entire', 'team', 'had', 'be', 'rebuilt', 'Sadly', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'able', 'capture', 'essence', 'entire', 'story', 'two', 'ways', 'First', 'not', 'only', 'building', 'football', 'team', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'rebuilding', 'community', 'tragedy', 'director', 'McG', 'captured', 'emotional', 'period', 'brilliantly', 'showing', 'how', 'members', 'school', 'community', 'grappled', 'issue', 'putting', 'team', 'field', 'risk', 'dredging', 'up', 'bad', 'memories', 'scrapping', 'football', 'program', 'altogether', 'people', 'yearn', 'see', 'green', 'white', 'colors', 'playing', 'field', 'others', 'are', 'haunted', 'memories', 'would', 'prefer', 'keep', 'arms', 'length', 'conflict', 'emotional', 'punch', 'film.Just', 'important', 'however', 'quality', 'acting', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'away', 'traditional', 'brainless', 'hunk', 'movie', 'roles', 'portray', 'Coach', 'Jack', 'Lengyl', 'who', 'brought', 'football', 'back', 'Marshall', 'McConaughey', 'role', 'bringing', 'enigmatic', 'coach', 'life', 'Also', 'impressive', 'Kata', 'Mara', 'role', 'Annie', 'Cantrell', 'personal', 'struggles', 'mirror', 'struggles', 'entire', 'community', 'However', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Jack', 'LOST', 'fame', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'Playing', 'Marshall', 'coach', 'not', 'doomed', 'plane', 'Fox', 'brilliant', 'portraying', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'relief', 'sorrow', 'regret', 'anger', 'guilt', 'etc', 'arise', 'complicated', 'emotional', 'situation', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'actor', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'playing', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'characters.Overall', 'very', 'inspirational', 'yet', 'also', 'quite', 'sorrowful', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'even', 'most', 'emotional', 'moments', 'always', 'exist', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'way', 'things', 'can', 'start', 'be', 'okay', 'such', 'tragedy', 'likely', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'situation', 'turned', 'out', 'knowledge', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'rooting', 'Marshall', 'same']",N/A
