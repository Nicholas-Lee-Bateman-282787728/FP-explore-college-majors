918396,A3GSIAVANOCHN5,B000A1GEUE,J. Elizabeth Dousson,"[1, 1]","Paul Grilley is a wonderful teacher.  He packs a world of material into his 4 hours of education time that all yogi's can benefit from, as well as PTs, dancers, and other body movement enthusiasts by skeletally explaining why bodies are so different and so why individual ability and range of motion for each of us is so unique to us...due to the nature of our bones, whether genetic or due to other reasons like injury.  It is a different kind of anatomy course than the more dry & usual ""...this is a femur, this is a pelvis"" kind of thing...b/c of how it translates to movement and a pose, but most importantly how we as teachers see the students we work with every day.  It is very absorbable & I highly recommend it.",5,fantastic educational tool for yogi's,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,721,"['Paul', 'Grilley', 'wonderful', 'teacher', 'world', 'material', '4', 'hours', 'education', 'time', 'can', 'benefit', 'as', 'well', 'PTs', 'dancers', 'other', 'body', 'movement', 'enthusiasts', 'skeletally', 'explaining', 'why', 'bodies', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'why', 'individual', 'ability', 'range', 'motion', 'so', 'unique', 'due', 'nature', 'bones', 'genetic', 'due', 'other', 'reasons', 'injury', 'different', 'kind', 'anatomy', 'course', 'more', 'dry', 'usual', 'femur', 'pelvis', 'kind', 'thing', 'b/c', 'how', 'movement', 'pose', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'teachers', 'see', 'students', 'work', 'day', 'very', 'absorbable', 'highly', 'recommend']",Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley

The first copy I received skipped and stuck a little bit and eventually got so bad it wouldn't play in my dvd player after a certain point. I put it in my laptop and it played a little further, but then it started hanging and skipping a bit farther into the dvd and wouldn't play there either. So I got a new dvd, and this one DID play in my dvd player but it still freezes and skips for maybe a second at a time...not enough to freeze or for me to miss anything, but I do question the quality of the dvd itself (not the content, which is fantastic!) I play dvds all the time and don't usually have this problem.",4,"I love, love, love this dvd BUT...",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,1016,"['am', 'very', 'new', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'been', 'very', 'helpful', 'interesting', 'now', 'feel', 'understand', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'about', 'helped', 'become', 'more', 'aware', 'how', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'pose', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'deeper', 'certain', 'poses', 'when', 'should', 'use', 'props.I', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'got', 'out', 'dvd', 'HOWEVER', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'dvd', 'first', 'copy', 'received', 'skipped', 'stuck', 'little', 'bit', 'eventually', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'dvd', 'player', 'certain', 'point', 'put', 'laptop', 'played', 'little', 'further', 'then', 'started', 'hanging', 'skipping', 'bit', 'farther', 'dvd', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'there', 'either', 'got', 'new', 'dvd', 'one', 'DID', 'play', 'dvd', 'player', 'still', 'skips', 'maybe', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'freeze', 'miss', 'anything', 'do', 'question', 'quality', 'dvd', 'not', 'content', 'fantastic', 'play', 'dvds', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'problem']",Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley

918399,A1352XXHOGVYWT,B000A1GEUE,"Ms. Mary S. Massung ""melodic wind""","[17, 19]","I started doing yoga 3.5 years ago.  Because I needed to use so many props, I stopped for a period of time to focus on weight-training...to increase my upper body strength.  After watching this video, I realized that, while the weight-training did help, the CORE of my problem was short arms and short legs...relative to my torso!  I will ALWAYS need props (blocks) when doing yoga simply because of my body proportions.  I also realized that I will NEVER be able to do certain poses (such as headstands)...again, because of physical proportions (arm length) and lack of adequate neck extension relative to arm length.  With the information in this dvd, I was able to immediately modify my power yoga in a way (using props) that allowed me to get the maximum benefit of various poses without feeling that I was 'cheating'!  While I recommend this dvd to everyone doing yoga, I especially recommend it to individuals who have short arms/legs!  With blocks, I can now maximize the benefit I get when doing my poses!mary",5,Incredibly Beneficial,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1017,"['started', 'doing', 'yoga', '3.5', 'years', 'ago', 'needed', 'use', 'so', 'many', 'props', 'stopped', 'period', 'time', 'focus', 'weight-training', 'increase', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'watching', 'video', 'realized', 'weight-training', 'did', 'help', 'CORE', 'problem', 'was', 'short', 'arms', 'short', 'legs', 'relative', 'torso', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'need', 'props', 'blocks', 'when', 'doing', 'yoga', 'simply', 'body', 'proportions', 'also', 'realized', 'will', 'NEVER', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'certain', 'poses', 'such', 'headstands', 'again', 'physical', 'proportions', 'arm', 'length', 'lack', 'adequate', 'neck', 'extension', 'relative', 'arm', 'length', 'information', 'dvd', 'was', 'able', 'immediately', 'modify', 'power', 'yoga', 'way', 'using', 'props', 'allowed', 'get', 'maximum', 'benefit', 'various', 'poses', 'feeling', 'was', ""'cheating"", 'recommend', 'dvd', 'everyone', 'doing', 'yoga', 'especially', 'recommend', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'short', 'arms/legs', 'blocks', 'can', 'now', 'maximize', 'benefit', 'get', 'when', 'doing', 'poses', 'mary']",Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley
918400,A1J9SUX6DLLADK,B000A1GEUE,ubalu,"[4, 4]","Time has come for this DVD. Though it was released a few years ago, it is gaining more popularity now. A no-nonsense program, it is high time someone gave the valuable message of `realistic' yoga for the average practitioner. In the West, where Yoga has become a `fashion' and even cult, more and more versatile forms are constantly `invented' to the point of absurdity. The message given by publications is `perfect' postures as displayed on some magazine covers with a young female in sexy clothing holding flawless-looking postures.Here is a program that tells us that we are all the same in the inner levels of our being, but unique on the physical level. We are built differently, and we must do Yoga our unique way. Of course, we know that all of us are not equally flexible and cannot do all asanas perfectly, but a program like this reinforcing this idea is helpful to the student who cannot `keep up' with the next person in the class.The presenter's background is obviously in Taoism and follows Yin Yoga. His teaching is effective and the demonstrations are excellent. All his statements may or may not be anatomically correct, but that is not the point. He deals with each and every joint in the body in a style understandable to all. He encourages everyone to do the Yoga that our bodies can accept, and be our unique selves.",5,'Realistic' Yoga,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,1338,"['Time', 'come', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'gaining', 'more', 'popularity', 'now', 'no-nonsense', 'program', 'high', 'time', 'someone', 'gave', 'valuable', 'message', 'realistic', 'yoga', 'average', 'practitioner', 'West', 'where', 'Yoga', 'become', 'fashion', 'even', 'cult', 'more', 'more', 'versatile', 'forms', 'are', 'constantly', 'invented', 'point', 'absurdity', 'message', 'given', 'publications', 'perfect', 'postures', 'displayed', 'magazine', 'young', 'female', 'sexy', 'clothing', 'holding', 'flawless-looking', 'postures.Here', 'program', 'are', 'same', 'inner', 'levels', 'being', 'unique', 'physical', 'level', 'are', 'built', 'differently', 'must', 'do', 'Yoga', 'unique', 'way', 'course', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'equally', 'flexible', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'asanas', 'perfectly', 'program', 'reinforcing', 'idea', 'helpful', 'student', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'next', 'person', 'class.The', 'presenter', 'background', 'obviously', 'Taoism', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'teaching', 'effective', 'demonstrations', 'are', 'excellent', 'statements', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anatomically', 'correct', 'not', 'point', 'joint', 'body', 'style', 'understandable', 'everyone', 'do', 'Yoga', 'bodies', 'can', 'accept', 'be', 'unique', 'selves']",Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley
