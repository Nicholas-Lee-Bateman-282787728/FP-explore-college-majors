The fundamentalists surely think Lynch is the Anti-Christ.Armed only with his acoustic guitar and boyish charm, Lynch articulates some of the silliest, crudest and creative stories you will ever hear recorded.  The DVD ""extra's"" are also well worth the price of admission!This is a great DVD for anyone not familiar with Stephen Lynch.  Although those already familiar with him will find some of the material redundant, this DVD will still make you laugh as it captures all Lynch's characteristic facial grimacing and hysterical mannerisms which are missed on his audio CDs.  Those who've seen him live will know what I'm talking about.If you like to laugh, and sexual topics, vuglarity and ""over the edge humor"" don't offend you, join Lynch for an intimate night  recorded live at the El Ray Theatre in Los Angeles.",4,Funny as Hell,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,983,"['grew', 'up', 'sense', 'Christian', 'Catholic', 'dogma', 'will', 'surely', 'need', 'repent', 'watching', 'one', '..', 'risk', 'going', 'straight', 'hell', 'handbasket', 'fundamentalists', 'surely', 'think', 'Lynch', 'Anti-Christ.Armed', 'only', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'boyish', 'charm', 'Lynch', 'silliest', 'crudest', 'creative', 'stories', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'extra', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'price', 'admission', 'great', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'Stephen', 'Lynch', 'already', 'familiar', 'will', 'find', 'material', 'redundant', 'DVD', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'Lynch', 'characteristic', 'facial', 'grimacing', 'hysterical', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'missed', 'audio', 'CDs', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'like', 'laugh', 'sexual', 'topics', 'vuglarity', 'edge', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'offend', 'join', 'Lynch', 'intimate', 'night', 'recorded', 'live', 'El', 'Ray', 'Theatre', 'Los', 'Angeles']",N/A

Many of his ""greatest hits"" ARE performed here, but they are hard to enjoy because of the non-stop interuptions by the live audience, which is only encouraged throughout the show by Lynch's pandering.  After a short while, it's just more annoying than funny.Even worse, because of the aforementioned pandering Lynch does to his live audience here, as he does while stumbling through 'Superhero', he even manages to ruin songs that are usually irresistably hilarious.Hopefully, Lynch and/or his manager will soon figure out that he could be MUCH bigger if he would go back to putting more emphasis on writing and performing songs that are simply more clever than they are clumsily callow.

It's fun to watch it in a different venue with a different audience. All of the best ""favorite hits"" are here. ""Lullabye"" is in the additional materials.Watching Stephen Lynch is like watching a big overgrown 15 year old who just delights in entertaining the audience around him and watching their reactions to his (often) dirty or double-entendre lyrics.One warning and one observation: Make sure the young ones are not in the room while viewing - this is strictly adult fun and FAR from the squeekly clean Stephen Lynch from The Wedding Singer...and an observation: Stephen looks and sounds tired in this DVD - like the tour has gone on a bit too long.

843711,AITIU2DG1MM4A,B0002RIKCQ,Timothy Haugh,"[20, 25]","I first saw Stephen Lynch on his Comedy Central special and thought he was one of the funniest comedians I had ever seen.  Not a guy that basically tells jokes, he is instead a musician and songwriter who writes some of the funniest original songs imaginable.  So, when I saw his DVD, I thought I'd take a look.It is, of course, very funny.  Many of his best songs are here in some form or another.  The performances of ""Baby,"" ""Special,"" ""Gay,"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""D & D"" were highlights for me.But, to be honest, I was a little disappointed overall.  ""Lullaby,"" a personal favorite, was relegated to the bonus features and was a studio clip.  The opening sequence in the green room started funny but went on way too long.  And I just happen not to be a fan of venues in which the audience over-participates.  I would rather just be able to enjoy the songs.What I'd rather see on DVD is that Comedy Central special which I enjoyed a lot more.  I love his CDs but, without his facial expressions, you're missing out.
