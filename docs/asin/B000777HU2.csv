Six people died so that this fool could say he skied down Everest.He claims to have skied for six minutes... Six minutes?  The actual run looks like about a minute at the most. Does that really count as &#34;skiing down Mt. Everest?&#34;  Wow, I'm so unimpressed and so dismayed at the same time. Six precious lives lost for this.This feat has about as much value as seeing how long you can pop a wheelie on a motorcycle on the Autobaun going a 100 mph.  Pure foolishness.  Would we celebrate that, especially if six people were killed in the process?Our society celebrates the most foolish things sometimes.I tried to watch the whole movie, which dragged on painfully, through each obstacle they faced, and at the end, a very anti-climatic ski run, in which he wipes out after about a minute.  Guess they counted his long slide after that as part of the skiing.All the way around, totally stupid.",1,The highs and lows of great foolishness,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,921,"['Ski', 'down', 'Mt', 'Everest', 'Six', 'people', 'died', 'so', 'fool', 'could', 'say', 'skied', 'down', 'Everest.He', 'claims', 'have', 'skied', 'six', 'minutes', 'Six', 'minutes', 'actual', 'run', 'minute', 'most', 'really', 'count', '34', 'skiing', 'down', 'Mt', 'Everest', '34', 'Wow', ""'m"", 'so', 'unimpressed', 'so', 'dismayed', 'same', 'time', 'Six', 'precious', 'lives', 'lost', 'this.This', 'feat', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'value', 'seeing', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'pop', 'wheelie', 'motorcycle', 'Autobaun', 'going', '100', 'mph', 'Pure', 'foolishness', 'Would', 'celebrate', 'especially', 'six', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'process', 'society', 'most', 'foolish', 'things', 'sometimes.I', 'tried', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'dragged', 'painfully', 'obstacle', 'faced', 'end', 'very', 'anti-climatic', 'ski', 'run', 'out', 'minute', 'Guess', 'counted', 'long', 'slide', 'part', 'skiing.All', 'way', 'totally', 'stupid']",N/A
877339,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000777HU2,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","I have been fascinated with Mount Everest since reading Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"".  There was an underlying message in that book that made me want to understand more about why someone would risk their life and struggle through overwelming physical challenges just to say they had climbed the mountain.  There was also a picture, in words, of a rugged beauty that served, in part, to explain that puzzle.  I have purchased and enjoyed a number of cinematic accounts of Everest climbs and the beauty and the questions still remain.  ""The Man Who Skied Down Everest"" is probably the best of those videos because the cinematography is outstanding and the quest is beyond the scope of just wanting to climb Everest; Yuichiro Miura wanted to ski down it.  Indeed, it did not appear that Everest was summitted but, rather, plummitted.The film begins as a sort of ""how to"" and shows all of the equiptment and provisions that needs to be hauled up to the base camp (I forget how many tons but it was a lot).  It takes us through the route that the porters (and climbers) had to journey.  That seemed like a challeging enough trek in itself.  We get to the base camp area of Everest which appeared as though Miura and his crew had sole reservations to.  This was in the early 1970's and was, apparently, before the climbing of Everest became such a popular sport.  Knowing about the thin air from Krakauer's book and other sources, I was astonished to see one of the party smoking a cigarette.  I recalled the time I did that in the Andes and almost passed out.  There is a tragic accident due to a cave in and half a dozen native porters are killed.  I pondered the superhuman efforts that must have occurred in order to recover the bodies.Eventually, we see Miura ski down a major portion of Everest and it is, by itself, worth the price of the DVD.  The uncredited part of this video presentation is the camera work that was done to bring this event into our homes.  Even on the single-file portering of the provisions up to the base camp, we get incredible camera shots from quite a distance.  It may be by plane in some cases but the shots vere very steady and I'm not sure that would have happened in an air-borne vehicle at that thin-air altitude.  The shots of the skiing also seemed to come from parrallel angles but the there was a noticeable decrease in clarity so it might have been shot from quite a distance at a lower altitude.  Either way, we got the feeling that we were seeing things from a relatively close perspective.I remembered the title of this movie from the Academy Awards from 1975.  It's title is compelling.  The film is even more so.",5,Incredible,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,2658,"['have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'reading', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'Into', 'Thin', 'Air', 'was', 'underlying', 'message', 'book', 'made', 'want', 'understand', 'more', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'risk', 'life', 'struggle', 'overwelming', 'physical', 'challenges', 'just', 'say', 'had', 'climbed', 'mountain', 'was', 'also', 'picture', 'words', 'rugged', 'beauty', 'served', 'part', 'explain', 'puzzle', 'have', 'purchased', 'enjoyed', 'number', 'cinematic', 'accounts', 'Everest', 'climbs', 'beauty', 'questions', 'still', 'remain', 'Man', 'Who', 'Skied', 'Down', 'Everest', 'probably', 'best', 'videos', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'quest', 'scope', 'just', 'wanting', 'climb', 'Everest', 'Yuichiro', 'Miura', 'wanted', 'ski', 'down', 'Indeed', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'Everest', 'was', 'summitted', 'rather', 'plummitted.The', 'film', 'sort', 'how', 'equiptment', 'provisions', 'be', 'hauled', 'up', 'base', 'camp', 'forget', 'how', 'many', 'tons', 'was', 'lot', 'route', 'porters', 'climbers', 'had', 'journey', 'seemed', 'challeging', 'enough', 'trek', 'get', 'base', 'camp', 'area', 'Everest', 'appeared', 'Miura', 'crew', 'had', 'sole', 'reservations', 'was', 'early', '1970', 'was', 'apparently', 'climbing', 'Everest', 'became', 'such', 'popular', 'sport', 'Knowing', 'thin', 'air', 'Krakauer', 'book', 'other', 'sources', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'one', 'party', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'recalled', 'time', 'did', 'Andes', 'almost', 'passed', 'out', 'tragic', 'accident', 'due', 'cave', 'dozen', 'native', 'porters', 'are', 'killed', 'pondered', 'superhuman', 'efforts', 'must', 'have', 'occurred', 'order', 'recover', 'bodies.Eventually', 'see', 'Miura', 'ski', 'down', 'major', 'portion', 'Everest', 'price', 'DVD', 'uncredited', 'part', 'video', 'presentation', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'bring', 'event', 'homes', 'Even', 'single-file', 'portering', 'provisions', 'base', 'camp', 'get', 'incredible', 'camera', 'shots', 'quite', 'distance', 'may', 'be', 'plane', 'cases', 'shots', 'vere', 'very', 'steady', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'air-borne', 'vehicle', 'thin-air', 'altitude', 'shots', 'skiing', 'also', 'seemed', 'come', 'parrallel', 'angles', 'was', 'noticeable', 'decrease', 'clarity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'quite', 'distance', 'lower', 'altitude', 'way', 'got', 'feeling', 'were', 'seeing', 'things', 'relatively', 'close', 'perspective.I', 'remembered', 'title', 'movie', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1975', 'title', 'compelling', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so']",N/A
877340,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B000777HU2,Robin Simmons,"[19, 19]","Winner of the 1975 Best Documentary Oscar, and certainly among the greatest adventure documentaries of all time, THE MAN WHO SKIED DOWN EVEREST (Image) might also be the first extreme Zen film.The opening, widescreen shot shows Everest (29,002') through a gap in the clouds just as the morning sun hits the forbidding peak. And then this quote:  ""Throughout time, mas has aspired to great heights in search of peace of mind and a quiet heart.  This is the story of such a man...""The man in question is Yuichiro Miura, poet, adventurer and world champion skier (he set a speed record).  The film follows his audacious attempt to ski down the upper slopes of Everest.  The film, shot in 35MM Panavision, begins in Katmandu where 800 porters begin a trek of 185 miles with 27 tons of equipment.Along the way, Miura visits Sir Edmund Hillary, who, in 1953, was the first climber (with his Sherpa partner Tenzing Norgay) to conquer Everest and return. Hillary says, ""When we stop looking for challenges, human beings will be in a very bad way.""The poetic Miura is quoted as saying, ""The challenge of the peaks is the challenge of life itself: To always struggle higher.""  Later he's quoted again: ""We have wandered from the paths of the wind and become children of fear.""After trekking 185 miles across the high passes to Tibet and the base of Everest they take on 400 Sherpas. It takes another 40 days to traverse the next three miles.Exquisitely photographed in beautifully composed shots, the breathtaking vistas are a dance of light and shadow and the memorable, poetic thoughts of Miura as he acclimates for his high altitude challenge in his ""life of adventure to escape the labyrinth of the city.""During the treacherous climb, death claims six team members as they cross an icefall.  About a thousand feet from the summit, Miura dons his skis, and with oxygen and a parachute, begins his descent.  Zooming, almost free-falling, over ice and rock, he travel upright almost a mile and half.  And then it happens.  The wind knocks him off balance, he hits a big rock and falls, skidding, bouncing, across rocky ridges, skipping like a stone for 1,320 feet.  He is stopped by a snowfield seconds away from the sure death of the Bergshrund Crevasse.I have never seen a movie anything like this.  If you have a big, widescreen TV, the pristine, high resolution images of this exotic place and extreme challenge will fill your field of vision and bend your mind until it literally takes your breath away during the last five minutes.  This is an ultimate armchair adventure.",5,WOW!

877342,A5VBAJ0G3UT6O,B000777HU2,THE-GO-BETWEEN,"[5, 5]","This movie has been out of print for decades but you could buy used VHS copies for a great price over the years.  Finally they have done the right thing and put it on DVD!!  Why these companies wait for years to reissue and transfer these classics to DVD is beyond me!!!  For example..the Jimmy Stewart classic ""The Spirit of St. Louis"" has just now been put on DVD!  And the movie ""Mind Walk"" is still only on VHS..and it took them YEARS to put the sailing movie ""Wind"" on DVD..and half a century to put the John Wayne classic ""The High and the Mighty"" on ANYTHING..(it is now on DVD!!).yet these companies are willing to instantly put the trashiest movies on DVD within weeks of the theatrical release.  Go figure..Anyway...I saw this AWARD WINNING movie in its original theatrical release in 1975. That impression lasted me for the rest of my life.  It was the best filmed mountain movie EVER up to that time....Great expense was put into filming it and really it is about the journey. I felt the actual skiing part down the slope was almost incidental!!!The music, sounds on the trek, and most of all the photography is monumental.  It stands the test of time (the IMAX movie ""Everest"" AND that soundtrack would be the other part of that litmus test).This movie is a MUST BUY.  Is there a soundtrack?? There should be.Let's get back to the photography....I really don't think many have topped this...and the format is for the big screen LCD's...staggering/breath taking photography.....Nothing about this film is rushed through...it is very gritty at times but the attraction of just panning all those high mountains never escapes the director... This is a magnificent work of art....the name of the movie  adds some sort of circus atmosphere to the whole affair and at first glance looks to be a stunt movie...but the ""stunt"" part is right at the end and for me was not the draw...it was the the cinematography.The narration could have been more poetic and woven into this movie more carefully...if there was a weakness here..this was it.Compare the Imax ""Everest"" narration of Liam Neeson and it makes my point. On this re-release they possibly had a chance to rethink this narration element since that part DOES sound dated and weak compared to the movie's very contemporary feeling re the ""extreme photography"" (for lack of a better expression)  and the beautiful music and sounds of the trail.  But it is what it is and you just go with it.When I saw this on a huge screen in the theater....it was the first time I had seen the Roof of the World in this manner.  This is certainly one of those films that MUST be seen on the big screen.  It would be nice if this was put in the theater again compared to the junk they are showing these days...but it would demand the rework of the narration.Buy this movie and if you don't have the IMAX ""EVERST"" one..buy that as well and the soundtrack..Another great piece of travel/geographic photography is ""Over Canada""...I think that is available here as well as the excellent soundtrack...Again listen to the narration used in ""Over Canada"" and compare it with ""The Man Who Skied Down Everest"".....",5,Finally...it has been reissued!!!!!
