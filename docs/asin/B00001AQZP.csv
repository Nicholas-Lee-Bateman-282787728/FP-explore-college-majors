510533,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00001AQZP,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[4, 5]","If the Harry Potter books are the most popular books of this generation, then the Nancy Drew books were the hits of the 1930s. Remarkably, how every decade since then, both girls and boys have rediscovered Nancy Drew and made her adventures their own. This is how you can tell the true classics apart from the pretenders.Like most of the `80s kids, I had never realized that the escapades of my favorite childhood heroine had ever been made into movies. It took a badly done remake in 2007 for somebody to realize that money could be made from the generations of fans who have adored the real Nancy Drew; and so these four films were released on DVD as part of a cross-promotional marketing tactic. Well lucky for us, anyhow!Starting with Nancy Drew, Detective and progressing to the Hidden Staircase, we get four fun mysteries.  Detective introduces Nancy and shows how she got started sleuthing when a wealthy elderly woman disappears mysteriously.  Reporter is about Nancy and Ted's investigation into a murder, which kicks off when Nancy is convinced that the accused woman is innocent. Troubleshooter follows Nancy and her dad to a vacation at Sylvan Lake where they uncover clues to exonerate a family friend who has been charged with the murder of a local businessman. Hidden Staircase is the most exciting mystery, in which Nancy and Ted find an underground tunnel in the basement of a ""haunted"" mansion. I regret that I no longer have a sharp memory for the specifics of the books' plots, so I cannot compare them to these movies with any accuracy, but their spirit is well kept as I remember them.*This* is the Nancy Drew I remembered from those books read so long ago: feisty, charismatic, energetic and unstoppable. Bonita Granville's Nancy is also impossibly cute, which is very much in keeping with the style of those times. The actor who played Ted Nickerson is the perfect sidekick, reluctant with just a touch of teenage dorkiness. I enjoyed their performance, if it was a bit over-the-top acting by today's standards.In my opinion, this Nancy Drew DVD would be enjoyed most by people who have read the books and who like nostalgic black and white films. It's certainly a wholesome and perhaps somewhat corny look back at the 1930s ideal of an independent, intelligent young lady.-Andrea, aka merribelle",4,A sweet collection of Old Hollywood-style Nancy Drews,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2320,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'are', 'most', 'popular', 'books', 'generation', 'then', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'books', 'were', 'hits', '1930s', 'Remarkably', 'how', 'decade', 'then', 'girls', 'boys', 'have', 'rediscovered', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'made', 'adventures', 'own', 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'true', 'classics', 'apart', 'pretenders.Like', 'most', '80s', 'kids', 'had', 'never', 'realized', 'escapades', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'heroine', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'movies', 'took', 'badly', 'done', 'remake', '2007', 'somebody', 'realize', 'money', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'generations', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'adored', 'real', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'four', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', 'part', 'cross-promotional', 'marketing', 'tactic', 'Well', 'lucky', 'anyhow', 'Starting', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Detective', 'progressing', 'Hidden', 'Staircase', 'get', 'four', 'fun', 'mysteries', 'Detective', 'introduces', 'Nancy', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'sleuthing', 'when', 'wealthy', 'elderly', 'woman', 'mysteriously', 'Reporter', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'investigation', 'murder', 'off', 'when', 'Nancy', 'convinced', 'accused', 'woman', 'innocent', 'Troubleshooter', 'Nancy', 'dad', 'vacation', 'Sylvan', 'Lake', 'where', 'uncover', 'clues', 'exonerate', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'been', 'charged', 'murder', 'local', 'businessman', 'Hidden', 'Staircase', 'most', 'exciting', 'mystery', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'find', 'underground', 'tunnel', 'basement', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'regret', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'sharp', 'memory', 'specifics', 'books', 'plots', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'movies', 'accuracy', 'spirit', 'well', 'kept', 'remember', '*This*', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'remembered', 'books', 'read', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'feisty', 'charismatic', 'energetic', 'unstoppable', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'Nancy', 'also', 'impossibly', 'cute', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'style', 'times', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Ted', 'Nickerson', 'perfect', 'sidekick', 'reluctant', 'just', 'touch', 'teenage', 'dorkiness', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'was', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'today', 'standards.In', 'opinion', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'who', 'nostalgic', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'certainly', 'wholesome', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'look', 'back', '1930s', 'ideal', 'independent', 'intelligent', 'young', 'lady.-Andrea', 'aka', 'merribelle']",N/A
510534,AMWPDGUXHTLYE,B00001AQZP,Aunt Book,"[19, 28]","I am having a hard time understanding why anyone would post that Bonita Granville's version of Nancy Drew is what Nancy was like.  Yes, she managed to solve the mysteries, but largely by luck; and the character is so dizzy, scatterbrained, silly, and immature that it's a wonder she solves them at all.  The hallmarks of the classic Nancy Drew were her competence, maturity, and self-possession.  She was a teenager, yes (first sixteen, later eighteen), but she behaved as an adult.  Gracious, intelligent, calm - none of these characteristics is found in the Nancy of these movies.""Ted"" Nickerson is unrelated to the Ned Nickerson of the books, as well.  He is younger, and kindly scornful (with good reason) of the Nancy who is always running off on some harebrained scheme and getting him into a mess, rather than being the admiring-with-reason, intelligent and competent Ned.The Carson Drew character suffers somewhat less, but his attitude to Nancy is that of an adult to a silly kid, not the trusting respect of the book Mr. Drew.I bought this set, even though I knew what the movies are like, simply because I am an avid Nancy Drew collector and want copies of all the movies and tv shows.  However, not one of them has come anywhere close to getting the character right.  By all means, buy this set, enjoy it as a relic of the 1930's; but don't expect the real Nancy Drew.",2,"Of historical interest, and fun in its way, but definitely not Nancy Drew",1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,1380,"['am', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'post', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'version', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'what', 'Nancy', 'was', 'Yes', 'managed', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'largely', 'luck', 'character', 'so', 'dizzy', 'scatterbrained', 'silly', 'immature', 'wonder', 'hallmarks', 'classic', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'were', 'competence', 'maturity', 'self-possession', 'was', 'teenager', 'yes', 'first', 'sixteen', 'later', 'eighteen', 'behaved', 'adult', 'Gracious', 'intelligent', 'calm', 'none', 'characteristics', 'found', 'Nancy', 'movies', 'Ted', 'Nickerson', 'unrelated', 'Ned', 'Nickerson', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'younger', 'kindly', 'scornful', 'good', 'reason', 'Nancy', 'who', 'always', 'running', 'off', 'harebrained', 'scheme', 'getting', 'mess', 'rather', 'being', 'admiring-with-reason', 'intelligent', 'competent', 'Ned.The', 'Carson', 'Drew', 'character', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'less', 'attitude', 'Nancy', 'adult', 'silly', 'kid', 'not', 'trusting', 'respect', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Drew.I', 'bought', 'set', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'am', 'avid', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'collector', 'want', 'copies', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'However', 'not', 'one', 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', 'getting', 'character', 'right', 'means', 'buy', 'set', 'enjoy', 'relic', '1930', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'real', 'Nancy', 'Drew']",N/A

510539,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00001AQZP,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","""Markham,"" says urbane gentleman crime-solver Philo Vance (William Powell) to the district attorney, ""I'm coming more and more to the belief that Archer Coe was killed in this room. That poker, this dagger sheath, now these fragments...it's all here."" ""But Vance,"" Markham says, ""do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs?"" ""I'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts,"" Vance says. ""This is the most remarkable case in my experience.""We're sympathetic. Wealthy, arrogant Archer Coe, disliked it seems by all who knew him, had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom, pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head. But wait. Further examination shows Coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull. Then there's the dagger wound in his back. Complicating matters is that Coe's bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside. Coe was no suicide; this was murder. But how could the killer have escaped? What was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects? And why was Coe's brother, Brisbane Coe, found dead in the main-floor closet?The Kennel Murder Case, now 73 years old, still provides a stylish look at the old locked-room classic whodunit. What makes it work as well as it does is, first, the mystery is complicated and clever, but still is logical. Second, is the amusing, assured performance of William Powell. Consider his work as Philo Vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as Nick Charles. Few things escape Vance. He uses his wits to piece things together. He's also good company. Powell was a star in the Twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over. His intelligence, style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary-seeming of actors from the past.Also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces. There's Mary Astor as Hilda Lake, the young, resentful and potentially rich ward of Coe; Paul Cavanaugh as a titled Brit hovering around Hilda; Helen Vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner (watch her really do her stuff in Vogues of 1938); Etienne Giraudot, a small, elderly man as the fussy Dr. Doremus, whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals; and Ralph Morgan as Archer Coe's private secretary. This movie has a high percentage of middle-aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug, English-cut tailored suits with ease. Most of all is Eugene Pallette, with his noble belly and gravel voice, as Detective Sergeant Heath. Sergeant Heath and Vance are long-time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other.The Roan Group DVD disc I have comes with Nancy Drew...Reporter (1939) on the flip side. To really enjoy Nancy Drew you need a high tolerance for perkiness and a sympathetic understanding that movies like this were designed for an America that has long vanished. Nancy (Bonita Granville) finds herself working as an intern at a newspaper and manages to finagle her way into a murder case. We know what happened, why and who did it within the first five minutes. We just need to sit back and see how Nancy involves just about everyone she knows to catch the killer. The charm of the movie depends on your appreciation of Nancy Drew's indomitable energy, ability to get herself into and out of scrapes, and her high-spirited confidence. Believe me, nothing gets Nancy Drew down for long. For connoisseurs of musical performances, there is a memorable one in a Chinese restaurant. Unable to pay a bill, Nancy, her sort-of-yet-innocent boyfriend, his 13 year-old little sister and her 11-year-old tag-along male chum convince the owners they are entertainers and will prove it if they don't have to wash dishes. The four of them perform an extended jive riff on ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" It's not bad, just jaw-dropping odd.Both pictures look and sound good on the Roan DVD. Considering how old they are, they are easy to watch. There are no extras and no chapter stops. The movie worth having is definitely The Kennel Murder Case.",4,"William Powell was one of the most stylish gentleman detectives around; Nancy Drew, however, is just perky",1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,4077,"['Markham', 'urbane', 'gentleman', 'crime-solver', 'Philo', 'Vance', 'William', 'Powell', 'district', 'attorney', ""'m"", 'coming', 'more', 'more', 'belief', 'Archer', 'Coe', 'was', 'killed', 'room', 'poker', 'dagger', 'sheath', 'now', 'fragments', 'here', 'Vance', 'Markham', 'do', 'mean', 'tell', 'dead', 'man', 'walked', 'upstairs', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'tell', 'anything', 'facts', 'Vance', 'most', 'remarkable', 'case', 'experience', ""'re"", 'sympathetic', 'Wealthy', 'arrogant', 'Archer', 'Coe', 'disliked', 'who', 'knew', 'had', 'been', 'found', 'slumped', 'chair', 'bedroom', 'pistol', 'hand', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'head', 'wait', 'Further', 'examination', 'shows', 'Coe', 'had', 'been', 'hit', 'hard', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'fractured', 'skull', 'Then', 'dagger', 'wound', 'back', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'Coe', 'bedroom', 'door', 'had', 'been', 'locked', 'inside', 'Coe', 'was', 'suicide', 'was', 'murder', 'how', 'could', 'killer', 'have', 'escaped', 'What', 'was', 'specific', 'motivation', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'suspects', 'why', 'was', 'Coe', 'brother', 'Brisbane', 'Coe', 'found', 'dead', 'main-floor', 'closet', 'Kennel', 'Murder', 'Case', 'now', '73', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'stylish', 'look', 'old', 'locked-room', 'classic', 'whodunit', 'What', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'mystery', 'complicated', 'clever', 'still', 'logical', 'Second', 'amusing', 'assured', 'performance', 'William', 'Powell', 'Consider', 'work', 'Philo', 'Vance', 'as', 'something', 'rehearsal', 'great', 'performances', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'Few', 'things', 'escape', 'Vance', 'wits', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'also', 'good', 'company', 'Powell', 'was', 'star', 'Twenties', 'moved', 'steadily', 'upward', 'status', 'popularity', 'when', 'talkies', 'took', 'over', 'intelligence', 'style', 'effortless', 'sophistication', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'contemporary-seeming', 'actors', 'past.Also', 'pleasant', 'seeing', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Hilda', 'Lake', 'young', 'resentful', 'potentially', 'rich', 'ward', 'Coe', 'Paul', 'Cavanaugh', 'titled', 'Brit', 'hovering', 'around', 'Hilda', 'Helen', 'Vinson', 'notably', 'sultry', 'selfish', 'manner', 'watch', 'really', 'do', 'stuff', 'Vogues', '1938', 'Etienne', 'Giraudot', 'small', 'elderly', 'man', 'fussy', 'Dr.', 'Doremus', 'job', 'coroner', 'medical', 'examiner', 'keeps', 'taking', 'away', 'meals', 'Ralph', 'Morgan', 'Archer', 'Coe', 'private', 'secretary', 'movie', 'high', 'percentage', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'ounce', 'fat', 'who', 'can', 'wear', 'snug', 'English-cut', 'tailored', 'suits', 'ease', 'Most', 'Eugene', 'Pallette', 'noble', 'belly', 'gravel', 'voice', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Heath', 'Sergeant', 'Heath', 'Vance', 'are', 'long-time', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'actually', 'seem', 'like', 'other.The', 'Roan', 'Group', 'DVD', 'disc', 'have', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Reporter', '1939', 'flip', 'side', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'need', 'high', 'tolerance', 'perkiness', 'sympathetic', 'understanding', 'movies', 'were', 'designed', 'America', 'long', 'vanished', 'Nancy', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'herself', 'working', 'intern', 'newspaper', 'manages', 'finagle', 'way', 'murder', 'case', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'who', 'did', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'just', 'need', 'sit', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'Nancy', 'just', 'everyone', 'catch', 'killer', 'charm', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'indomitable', 'energy', 'ability', 'get', 'scrapes', 'high-spirited', 'confidence', 'Believe', 'nothing', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'down', 'long', 'connoisseurs', 'musical', 'performances', 'memorable', 'one', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'Unable', 'pay', 'bill', 'Nancy', 'sort-of-yet-innocent', 'boyfriend', '13', 'year-old', 'little', 'sister', '11-year-old', 'tag-along', 'male', 'chum', 'convince', 'owners', 'are', 'entertainers', 'will', 'prove', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wash', 'dishes', 'four', 'perform', 'extended', 'jive', 'riff', 'Mary', 'Had', 'Little', 'Lamb', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'jaw-dropping', 'odd.Both', 'pictures', 'look', 'sound', 'good', 'Roan', 'DVD', 'Considering', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'are', 'easy', 'watch', 'are', 'extras', 'chapter', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', 'definitely', 'Kennel', 'Murder', 'Case']",N/A

510549,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00001AQZP,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Nancy Drew was created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer and writer Mildred Wirt Benson in 1930 as a female counterpart to the already popular Hardy Boys. As originally written, Nancy was sixteen, rich, a teenage risk taker, and not above packing heat if she thought it was necessary. In the 1959 the earlier novels were re-written and Nancy was somewhat softened into an eighteen year old with numerous social graces, affluent rather than flatly rich, and someone who might bend the law but never break it.The Bonita Granville (1923-1988) film series was, of course, based on the original character, so viewers who know the character only from the re-written novels and later television series may be in for a surprise, as Nancy defies her father, sneers at law enforcement officers, and fires off a gun. In NANCY DREW: DETECTIVE (1938) Nancy investigates the sudden disappearance of a rich but eccentric woman who has vanished on the eve of making a substantial donation to Nancy&#8217;s school. Could it be a case of kidnapping? In NANCY DREW: REPORTER (1939) Nancy is an intern for the local newspaper&#8212;but instead of accepting her assignment, she defies the editor and goes to a criminal trial, where she becomes convinced the convicted killer is innocent. What else can she do but investigate the case?In NANCY DREW: TROUBLESHOOTER (1939), a friend of Nancy&#8217;s father, lawyer Carson Drew, is discovered murdered at his ranch&#8212;and although her father tells her not to become involved, she does precisely that. NANCY DREW AND THE HIDDEN STAIRCASE (1939) is the only film in the series that is based on one of the Nancy Drew novels, but so vaguely that little more than the title remains. In this tale, Nancy sets out to help two elderly ladies who are in danger of being evicted from the family home &#8230; and discover the chauffer&#8217;s body in the process.Each of Granville&#8217;s Nancy Drew movies run about an hour long and she is co-starred with John Litel as Carson Drew and Frankie Thomas as boy-next-door Ted Nickerson (producers thought the name &#8216;Ned,&#8217; used in the book, was too old fashioned.) Unlike the novels, murders do occur, and the dangers Nancy encounters are often lethal. But even at an hour&#8217;s length, and even with the added dangers, the series is rather clunky. Granville is pert and enthusiastic and the casts are effective, but the scripts, direction, and production values are nothing to write home about. These were &#8220;B&#8221; movies plain and simple, and while they were mildly popular when released, they weren&#8217;t popular enough to continue into a long-running series like Blondie or Charlie Chan. The collection comes on two DVDs, and the elements are good, but there are no bonuses, and this is really a purchase for a die-hard Nancy Drew fan.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Mildly Entertaining for Nancy Drew Fans,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,2843,"['Nancy', 'Drew', 'was', 'created', 'publisher', 'Edward', 'Stratemeyer', 'writer', 'Mildred', 'Wirt', 'Benson', '1930', 'female', 'counterpart', 'already', 'popular', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'originally', 'written', 'Nancy', 'was', 'sixteen', 'rich', 'teenage', 'risk', 'taker', 'not', 'packing', 'heat', 'thought', 'was', 'necessary', '1959', 'earlier', 'novels', 'were', 're-written', 'Nancy', 'was', 'somewhat', 'softened', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'numerous', 'social', 'graces', 'affluent', 'rather', 'flatly', 'rich', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'bend', 'law', 'never', 'break', 'it.The', 'Bonita', 'Granville', '1923-1988', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'course', 'based', 'original', 'character', 'viewers', 'who', 'know', 'character', 'only', 're-written', 'novels', 'later', 'television', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'surprise', 'Nancy', 'father', 'sneers', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'off', 'gun', 'NANCY', 'DREW', 'DETECTIVE', '1938', 'Nancy', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'rich', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'who', 'vanished', 'eve', 'making', 'substantial', 'donation', 'Nancy', '8217', 's', 'school', 'Could', 'be', 'case', 'kidnapping', 'NANCY', 'DREW', 'REPORTER', '1939', 'Nancy', 'intern', 'local', 'newspaper', '8212', 'instead', 'accepting', 'assignment', 'editor', 'criminal', 'trial', 'where', 'convinced', 'convicted', 'killer', 'innocent', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'investigate', 'case', 'NANCY', 'DREW', 'TROUBLESHOOTER', '1939', 'friend', 'Nancy', '8217', 'father', 'lawyer', 'Carson', 'Drew', 'discovered', 'murdered', 'ranch', '8212', 'father', 'not', 'become', 'involved', 'precisely', 'NANCY', 'DREW', 'THE', 'HIDDEN', 'STAIRCASE', '1939', 'only', 'film', 'series', 'based', 'one', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'novels', 'so', 'vaguely', 'little', 'more', 'title', 'tale', 'Nancy', 'out', 'help', 'two', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'who', 'are', 'danger', 'being', 'evicted', 'family', 'home', '8230', 'discover', 'chauffer', '8217', 's', 'body', 'process.Each', 'Granville', '8217', 's', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'movies', 'run', 'hour', 'long', 'co-starred', 'John', 'Litel', 'Carson', 'Drew', 'Frankie', 'Thomas', 'boy-next-door', 'Ted', 'Nickerson', 'producers', 'thought', 'name', '8216', 'Ned', '8217', 'used', 'book', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'fashioned', 'novels', 'murders', 'do', 'occur', 'dangers', 'Nancy', 'encounters', 'are', 'often', 'lethal', 'even', 'hour', '8217', 's', 'length', 'even', 'added', 'dangers', 'series', 'rather', 'clunky', 'Granville', 'pert', 'enthusiastic', 'casts', 'are', 'effective', 'scripts', 'direction', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'were', '8220', 'B', '8221', 'movies', 'plain', 'simple', 'were', 'mildly', 'popular', 'when', 'released', 'weren', '8217', 'popular', 'enough', 'continue', 'long-running', 'series', 'Blondie', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'collection', 'two', 'DVDs', 'elements', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'bonuses', 'really', 'purchase', 'die-hard', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'fan.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Nancy Drew (played by Bonita Granville), an enthusiastic, insightful teen, delights in solving crimes.  Her successful lawyer father, Carson Drew (played by John Litel) tries to restrain and protect her, to little avail.  Nancy's best friend is compliant, inventive Ted Nickerson (played by Frankie Thomas), who takes frequent tumbles in Nancy's behalf.  Each film is a separate story and lasts from 60 to 69 minutes.  The principals are all excellent and are supported by fine character actors.In Nancy Drew - Detective, wealthy alumna Mary Eldredge wants to leave $250,000 to Nancy's school but suddenly disappears.  Nancy's doctor reports being kidnapped to treat an old woman in a secret place, to gain entry to which, one must use the password `Blue Bells'.  An injured carrier pigeon shows up with a message containing the password.  Nancy goes to work to find out what happened to the alumna and to get the money for the school.  Nancy and Ted disguise themselves.  The story is based on `Password to Larkspur Lane'.In Nancy Drew - Reporter,  Nancy, entered in a newspaper's reporting contest, visits a coroner's inquest and decides the likely defendant is innocent.  The key to the case is finding the tin can the poison came in because the can preserves all fingerprints, including the real murderer's.  Ted has to box, and a hotel sign provides fun.In Nancy Drew - Trouble Shooter, a family friend at Sylvan Lake is accused of murder.  When a dead man is found under a rare, tropical flower in a field, Nancy starts to snoop.  She is not happy that her father enjoys the company of a woman neighbor.  Nancy and Ted get to ride in a biplane.In Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase, two elderly sisters intend to donate their property to a hospital once they own it in two weeks.  By their father's will, at least one sister has to sleep in the large house each night in order to inherit.  The problems are that people are trying to steal the proof the sisters met the terms of the will, that the sisters' chauffeur is found shot, and that small sounds and thefts are going on at night inside.  Should the sisters flee their home?  Nancy and Ted find a passageway in the basement that clarifies matters.  The film is based on ""The Hidden Staircase"".All four black & white films look good, although there are some brief segments of `Detective' that don't and at times `Reporter' looks viewed through a very thin waterfall.  (The picture is still far ahead of Alpha Video's.)There are no sex or language issues.  There are no skin scenes, other than a boxing match in `Reporter' between Ted and an older, bad guy.  Nancy and Ted are pals and don't even kiss.  The chemistry is good.The characters often say '23 80', which refers to the $23.80 fixed weekly payment to WPA workers; so if you bet '23 80', you are betting a lot.",4,Four-Film Classic Series,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,2955,"['Original', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Mystery', 'Collection', 'four', 'movie', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'series', 'released', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '1938-9', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'played', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'enthusiastic', 'insightful', 'teen', 'delights', 'solving', 'crimes', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'father', 'Carson', 'Drew', 'played', 'John', 'Litel', 'restrain', 'protect', 'little', 'avail', 'Nancy', 'best', 'friend', 'compliant', 'inventive', 'Ted', 'Nickerson', 'played', 'Frankie', 'Thomas', 'who', 'frequent', 'tumbles', 'Nancy', 'behalf', 'film', 'separate', 'story', '60', '69', 'minutes', 'principals', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'supported', 'fine', 'character', 'actors.In', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Detective', 'wealthy', 'alumna', 'Mary', 'Eldredge', 'leave', '250,000', 'Nancy', 'school', 'suddenly', 'Nancy', 'doctor', 'reports', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'treat', 'old', 'woman', 'secret', 'place', 'gain', 'entry', 'one', 'must', 'use', 'password', 'Blue', 'Bells', 'injured', 'carrier', 'pigeon', 'up', 'message', 'containing', 'password', 'Nancy', 'work', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'alumna', 'get', 'money', 'school', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'disguise', 'story', 'based', 'Password', 'Larkspur', ""Lane'.In"", 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Reporter', 'Nancy', 'entered', 'newspaper', 'reporting', 'contest', 'coroner', 'inquest', 'likely', 'defendant', 'innocent', 'key', 'case', 'finding', 'tin', 'can', 'poison', 'came', 'can', 'preserves', 'fingerprints', 'including', 'real', 'murderer', 'Ted', 'box', 'hotel', 'sign', 'fun.In', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Trouble', 'Shooter', 'family', 'friend', 'Sylvan', 'Lake', 'accused', 'murder', 'When', 'dead', 'man', 'found', 'rare', 'tropical', 'flower', 'field', 'Nancy', 'snoop', 'not', 'happy', 'father', 'company', 'woman', 'neighbor', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'get', 'ride', 'biplane.In', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Hidden', 'Staircase', 'two', 'elderly', 'sisters', 'intend', 'donate', 'property', 'hospital', 'own', 'two', 'weeks', 'father', 'will', 'least', 'one', 'sister', 'sleep', 'large', 'house', 'night', 'order', 'inherit', 'problems', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'steal', 'proof', 'sisters', 'met', 'terms', 'will', 'sisters', 'chauffeur', 'found', 'shot', 'small', 'sounds', 'thefts', 'are', 'going', 'night', 'inside', 'Should', 'sisters', 'flee', 'home', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'find', 'passageway', 'basement', 'matters', 'film', 'based', 'Hidden', 'Staircase', 'four', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'look', 'good', 'are', 'brief', 'segments', 'Detective', 'do', ""n't"", 'times', 'Reporter', 'viewed', 'very', 'thin', 'waterfall', 'picture', 'still', 'far', 'ahead', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'are', 'sex', 'language', 'issues', 'are', 'skin', 'scenes', 'other', 'boxing', 'match', 'Reporter', 'Ted', 'older', 'bad', 'guy', 'Nancy', 'Ted', 'are', 'pals', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'kiss', 'chemistry', 'good.The', 'characters', 'often', 'say', ""'23"", '80', '23.80', 'fixed', 'weekly', 'payment', 'WPA', 'workers', 'so', 'bet', '80', 'are', 'betting', 'lot']",N/A

So the quality of the films varies.2) There is a wonderful and enchanting chemistry between Bonita Granville as Nancy Drew and Frankie  Thomas as her boyfriend Ted Nickerson.  The two of them are so funny and lovable together, I wish they had made more movies just to see them together.3) True Nancy Drew fans will find that the movie Nancy and the book Nancy are very different. The Nancy Drew of the books was valiant, brave, intelligent and embodied all the qualities of a ""perfect"" Girl. The Nancy Drew of the films is headstrong, immature, manipulative, impetuous, and loud! But she is also cute, adorable, pretty and funny!  Ted (as portrayed) by Thomas, is always browbeaten into getting dragged into  Nancy's schemes. Kind of like Ethel was to Lucy. He  also takes many of the pratfalls. Although they don't obviously play the romantic angle between the teens, their attraction  for each other is obvious.  You just can't help liking them.4) This is a cute movie for kids, with enough adventure and laughs to entertain.5) These 4 movies were part of Warner Bros. B list movies but are quite good due to the chemistry between Granville and Thomas. Having seen these two performers in other things I know that both were better than the material that they were given. I wish more movies had been made of the series just to seen Granville and Thomas together. I just fell in love with these two together.6)For people interested in fashion, the clothing provides some wonderful examples of fashion of the time. Especially Nancy and Ned's clothes. Both are so attractive , that they show the clothes to the best advantage.7) the movie suffers from some typical B movie formula common at the time. eg; there is a stupid police chief who is so stupid you wonder how he became a policeman at all.

510570,A1GWSZ4I2QGCNJ,B00001AQZP,Laughing Gravy,"[8, 8]","THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is one of the best cinema murder mysteries of the 1930s, a delight from start to finish.William Powell is remembered today as Nick Charles in the Thin Man films, but before that he was suave, debonair Philo Vance in a series of films based on the classic novels by S.S. Van Dine.As the film opens, you'll find more intrigue at the Long Island Kennel Club than you will at an Agatha Christie British manor. A swanky society crank, Archer Coe (Robert Barrat), seems to go out of his way to insult and bully everybody, including his niece (Mary Astor), his niece's fianc&eacute;e (Paul Cavanaugh), his personal secretary (Ralph Morgan), his brother (Frank Conroy), his mistress (Helen Vinson), his mistress' boyfriend (Jack LaRue), and his Chinese cook (James Lee). When Coe is found dead in his bedroom, all the doors and windows locked from the inside, everybody thinks he committed suicide - everybody, that is, but our boy Philo, who notices some anomalies in the setting. Not only does Vance have to figure out who killed Coe, though, he also has to figure out how.Michael Curtiz directed the film, and did a masterful job, keeping the lean film moving swiftly. There isn't a spare second in the film's brief (under 75 min.) running time, and you'll be laughing and guessing along with Vance until the final frame. Did I say laughing? Yes, there's some good comic relief from Etienne Girardot as a grumpy coroner who finds the escalating body count interfering with his meals (""There's too many people in the world anyway!"") and gravel-voiced Eugene Pallette as a clueless detective (faced with a victim who was bludgeoned, stabbed in the back, and then shot in the head, the detective whispers to the coroner, ""Is there any chance it was suicide?"").I loved this film, and was delighted to find that - although it's been in the public domain for many years and available on VHS and DVD from many sources - the Roan Group print is superb.

They are a bit childish because of the age of the characters; teenagers today would never act the way these teens do. However, if one can ignore that, the movies are highly enjoyable and great for all ages.First, we have Nancy Drew: Detective, a film about an elderly benefactor who plans to donate much of her fortune to the girls' school that Nancy attends. Before she can donate the money, though, she disappears. Nancy is positive she has been kidnapped, despite the little evidence to support the claim. Along with the help of Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas) and her lawyer father (John Litel), she finds that there is a plot afoot, and it might be more dangerous than she originally suspected.In Nancy Drew: Reporter, Nancy switches her throw-away assignment for the local newspaper in favor of a murder trial. She knows that the woman is innocent, even though the evidence is stacked against her. If only Nancy could get her father to represent the case! But as always, Nancy takes things into her own hands, and ropes Ted into the deal.Nancy Drew can't stand the sight of her father falling for a woman in Nancy Drew: Troubleshooter. They venture to the country so her father can work on a case against his friend, Nancy's ""Uncle Matt,"" who has been accused of murder. They're safe, until they find the body of the missing man, and unfortunately the evidence is against good-old Matt. Nancy is suspicious as always, and looks into things a little deeper. With the help of a stereotypical servant named Apollo, she sees that the case is much more complicated than her father realizes.The film with the most exciting title is Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase. Two elderly ladies are started when a murder occurs in their home despite no access for an intruder to commit the crime. They fear paranormal activity because they have been hearing strange noises coming from the basement. They cannot leave unless they want to lose possession of their home because of some technicalities in a will that gave them the house. It is up to Nancy Drew and Ted the ice man to figure out what exactly is causing all of the problems in the old Civil War era home.",5,"""I guess it's just my woman's intuition.""",1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2371,"['Nancy', 'Drew', 'was', 'highly', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'became', 'group', 'b-level', 'movies', 'starring', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'title', 'role', 'four', 'films', 'are', 'excellent', 'little', 'mysteries', 'short', 'sweet', 'plenty', 'gusto', 'are', 'bit', 'childish', 'age', 'characters', 'teenagers', 'today', 'would', 'never', 'act', 'way', 'teens', 'do', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'ignore', 'movies', 'are', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'ages.First', 'have', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Detective', 'film', 'elderly', 'benefactor', 'who', 'donate', 'much', 'fortune', 'girls', 'school', 'Nancy', 'can', 'donate', 'money', 'though', 'Nancy', 'positive', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'little', 'evidence', 'support', 'claim', 'help', 'Ted', 'Nickerson', 'Frankie', 'Thomas', 'lawyer', 'father', 'John', 'Litel', 'plot', 'afoot', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'dangerous', 'originally', 'suspected.In', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Reporter', 'Nancy', 'throw-away', 'assignment', 'local', 'newspaper', 'favor', 'murder', 'trial', 'woman', 'innocent', 'even', 'evidence', 'stacked', 'only', 'Nancy', 'could', 'get', 'father', 'represent', 'case', 'always', 'Nancy', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'ropes', 'Ted', 'deal.Nancy', 'Drew', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'sight', 'father', 'falling', 'woman', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Troubleshooter', 'venture', 'country', 'father', 'can', 'work', 'case', 'friend', 'Nancy', 'Uncle', 'Matt', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'murder', ""'re"", 'safe', 'find', 'body', 'missing', 'man', 'unfortunately', 'evidence', 'good-old', 'Matt', 'Nancy', 'suspicious', 'always', 'things', 'little', 'deeper', 'help', 'stereotypical', 'servant', 'named', 'Apollo', 'case', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'father', 'realizes.The', 'film', 'most', 'exciting', 'title', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Hidden', 'Staircase', 'Two', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'are', 'started', 'when', 'murder', 'home', 'access', 'intruder', 'commit', 'crime', 'fear', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'have', 'been', 'hearing', 'strange', 'noises', 'coming', 'basement', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'want', 'lose', 'possession', 'home', 'technicalities', 'will', 'gave', 'house', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Ted', 'ice', 'man', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'causing', 'problems', 'old', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'home']",N/A

I am late again but will add, this is a great entry into the many famous detective series of the 30's. Bonita Granville who originated the role may appear a bit ""perky"" to some, but we must remember she was a typical all American teen who was not only very intelligent for her age but also had a knack for solving very clever clues to unravel a crime or mystery.For Granville, this series liberated her typecasting as a ""brat"" that she was playing prior to the Drew movies. In real life, she was a very gracious lady who went on to produce the famed LASSIE TV series. Warner Brothers hoped the Drew franchise would continue after 4 movies (contained in this set), but Granville was growing up and ready to play roles more suited to her age.Based on the beloved series of novels by Carolyn Keene (a pseudonym for many writers of the books), all the remakes of Nancy drew pale in comparison including the television series.For those young girls who loved the books, and nostalgia buffs, will certainly find this an entertaining, if not a bit fluffy series. The 4 movies do manage to create suspense--making this one of the better entries in the genre.Worthwhile, despite the sometimes imperfect transfers to DVD--and nicely priced.",5,FOR THOSE WHO LOVE OLD DETECTIVE MOVIES,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,1321,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'outlines', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'discussed', 'previous', 'reviews', 'am', 'late', 'again', 'will', 'add', 'great', 'entry', 'many', 'famous', 'detective', 'series', '30', 'Bonita', 'Granville', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'may', 'appear', 'bit', 'perky', 'must', 'remember', 'was', 'typical', 'American', 'teen', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'intelligent', 'age', 'also', 'had', 'knack', 'solving', 'very', 'clever', 'clues', 'unravel', 'crime', 'mystery.For', 'Granville', 'series', 'liberated', 'typecasting', 'brat', 'was', 'playing', 'prior', 'Drew', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'gracious', 'lady', 'who', 'went', 'produce', 'famed', 'LASSIE', 'TV', 'series', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'hoped', 'Drew', 'franchise', 'would', 'continue', '4', 'movies', 'contained', 'set', 'Granville', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'ready', 'play', 'roles', 'more', 'suited', 'age.Based', 'beloved', 'series', 'novels', 'Carolyn', 'Keene', 'pseudonym', 'many', 'writers', 'books', 'remakes', 'Nancy', 'drew', 'pale', 'comparison', 'including', 'television', 'series.For', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'loved', 'books', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'entertaining', 'not', 'bit', 'fluffy', 'series', '4', 'movies', 'do', 'manage', 'create', 'suspense', 'making', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'genre.Worthwhile', 'sometimes', 'imperfect', 'transfers', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'priced']",N/A
