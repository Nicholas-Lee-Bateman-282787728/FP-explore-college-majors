1050489,A130YN8T37O833,B000MTDRKO,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[1, 4]","This is a really nice show. I brought disc 1 many years ago when it initially came out and was only able to watch 1 or 2 episodes. To be quite honest anime hasnt really done anything amazing lately to get me HOOKED on any new series. Sailor Moon back in the mid to late 90's was what got me really hooked when it debuted on the WB Channel 11 at around 6am in the morning (which is way to early). Of course at that time anime was very limited on US TV. I havent been ADDICTED to any series the way i have Sailor Moon for many years. Anyways back to this show, i recently got free time to actually sit down & get away from my hectic life to watch more then 2 episodes. I finished the entire 1st disc & was pretty impressed with the dubbing & storyline etc. This show reminds me alot of Ranma 1/2. Then i went on Amazon and found the complete series was on sale for $39.00 with the original price being 60.00. Total deal!!! You get all 8 dics of the series which includes season 1 and season 2 over 800 min of anime. Many years ago if you wanted over 800 mins worth of anime you'd be shelling out hundreds of dollars to keep getting each disc of the series at 4 episodes per disc. The only reason this got 5 stars and not 4 was cause the price was such a bargain. Thank goodness for places like Amazon which offers nice sale prices on their items or else id have to pay full retail price. $39.00 is really a snag which amounts to $5.00 per DVD. The only complaint is it didnt come in a box set thin pak format. The set was just the actual 8 DVDs that were indiviually released. Would of been nice to have a nice outer box to put them in. I cant wait to get home and finish up the series.",5,Nice SHOW!!!!!!,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1684,"['really', 'nice', 'show', 'brought', 'disc', '1', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'initially', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'watch', '1', '2', 'episodes', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'anime', 'hasnt', 'really', 'done', 'anything', 'amazing', 'lately', 'get', 'HOOKED', 'new', 'series', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'back', 'mid', 'late', '90', 'was', 'what', 'got', 'really', 'hooked', 'when', 'debuted', 'WB', 'Channel', '11', 'around', '6am', 'morning', 'way', 'early', 'course', 'time', 'anime', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'US', 'TV', 'havent', 'been', 'ADDICTED', 'series', 'way', 'i', 'have', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'show', 'i', 'recently', 'got', 'free', 'time', 'actually', 'sit', 'down', 'get', 'away', 'hectic', 'life', 'watch', 'more', 'then', '2', 'episodes', 'finished', 'entire', '1st', 'disc', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'dubbing', 'storyline', 'etc', 'show', 'alot', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Then', 'i', 'went', 'Amazon', 'found', 'complete', 'series', 'was', 'sale', '39.00', 'original', 'price', 'being', '60.00', 'Total', 'deal', 'get', '8', 'dics', 'series', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', '800', 'min', 'anime', 'Many', 'years', 'ago', 'wanted', '800', 'mins', 'worth', 'anime', ""'d"", 'be', 'shelling', 'out', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'keep', 'getting', 'disc', 'series', '4', 'episodes', 'disc', 'only', 'reason', 'got', '5', 'stars', 'not', '4', 'was', 'cause', 'price', 'was', 'such', 'bargain', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'places', 'Amazon', 'nice', 'sale', 'prices', 'items', 'else', 'id', 'have', 'pay', 'full', 'retail', 'price', '39.00', 'really', 'snag', '5.00', 'DVD', 'only', 'complaint', 'didnt', 'come', 'box', 'set', 'thin', 'pak', 'format', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'actual', '8', 'DVDs', 'were', 'indiviually', 'released', 'Would', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'nice', 'outer', 'box', 'put', 'cant', 'wait', 'get', 'home', 'finish', 'up', 'series']",Ai Yori Aoshi + Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi - Complete Set
1050490,A2U5ASY5JSL2WA,B000MTDRKO,"Bakajanaino? ""raven cat""","[0, 0]","This anime is bar none the best harem anime of the last decade. I normally don't like the Love Hina type  animes, or things like He Is My Master so I was slightly worried when I purchased this one that it would turn out to be similar. However, I also had a lot of hope because Tenchi Muyo is one of my all-time favorites and it is in the harem genre. Perhaps this would be good as well...But there are no space pirates, universally famous genii, space cops or princesses from distant ruling planets. So did I like Ai Yori Aoshi?To say the least, I was VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY satisfied beyond expectations.Before I even watched the anime itself, I noticed the beautiful DVDs in their individual cases. They almost look like some type of colorful blown glass, as each one is decorated with a different type of flower.But you don't buy an anime to look at the pretty DVDs. So now here's my assessment of the show:The theme song, sung by Yoko Ishida, is like a warm summer breeze, very soothing. If you like more upbeat J-pop/J-rock music it may not impress you, but it is beautiful and has the perfect 'feel' for this anime.  The ending song is very similar, just sung by The Indigo. It is very mellow and pensive.Next I'll talk about Kaoru Hanabishi, the bond which ties Aoi and the other girls together. He is not lecherous at all, as is common in the harem genre, and is surprisingly complex. There are very few people who will not find the story of Kaoru's life moving even to the point of tears. After escaping a terribly abusive life at the hands of his father's family the Hanabishi clan, he stands on his own two feet all alone in Tokyo, going to college and supporting himself with no one's help. Making it day to day in an apartment working part-time jobs, Kaoru carries on his life...until a blue-haired childhood friend comes along-oh, and by the way, she's his fiance.""I am not perfect, but hopefully you will accept me...""With a gentle and yet strong spirit she stands up to her gaurdian Miyabi-san as well as her mother, determined to take her time and heal Kaoru's wounds even at the risk of being cut off from her family.So will their love be able to blossom even though they only met as children? If so, will her parents allow this to continue? Will Kaoru's future be brighter than his past?I will not spoil too much of the plot, but I will say that this is an adventure you will not want to miss. There are a lot of interesting people to meet along the way, and much to be learned about the true strength of love.The animation itself looks very beautiful, elaborate enough to be an Original Video Animation. Ai Yori Aoshi is one of the most lovely animes I have seen in my life, even though I am not a real shonen manga person (this anime was serialized in Young Animal, a magazine for japanese teenage boys).  It cost a little more than most anime on this site, but you will NOT REGRET BUYING THIS!! I promise. You would spend about $200 dollars if you were to buy every single DVD from Borders or Barnes and Noble. I know I haven't mentioned the second season Enishi very much...the bottom line is that you HAVE to buy both seasons. The second season of this anime is just as good if not better i its own way. You get to learn a lot more about the characters you thought you knew...don't miss it : )DISCLAIMER***************This is a very good anime, however I would suggest only watching it in Japanese.

While I have never read the manga the anime itself was very entertaining and heart-warming.  The series love interest is Kaoru Hanabishi(A young college student who was to be the heir of a great corporation  left his family after tiring of their abusive ways towards him),  and Aoi Sakuraba(Daughter of another powerful corporation family who as a child was betrothed to Kaoru when they were children.)  Since Kaoru left his family Aoi's family wanted to dissolve their engagement but Aoi refused and followed Karou to the city.  Kaoru who after living a few years by himself had forgotten the engagement and is shocked to see Aoi again.  Kaoru at first doesn't want to see Aoi and tries to get her to forget the engagement and leave but after a incident lets her stay with him.  After Aoi's chaperon arrives she at first refuse Aoi and Karou to stay in the same apartment and after a while has Karou move into the Sakuraba's family mansion in the city along with Aoi to keep an eye on both of them.  Of course through the series you'll get more hijinx and romantic situations as five other girls enter the picture and all have some romantic feelings for Karou thus making a little small competition between them and Aoi.  I'm sure there are many western women who might find offense of Aoi's seemingsubservient attitude with Karou but there are some differences between western and eastern cultures and manners and some eastern women would just as easily find western women attitudes insulting or offensive.

1050498,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B000MTDRKO,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[9, 9]","Ai Yori Aoshi and Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi are some of the better offerings from Pioneer/Geneon and is worth picking up if you happen to find it available. The series closely follows the manga by Kou Fumizuki, though the story and art are slightly simplified for the video. The manga and anime have been mistaken as shojo (manga or anime for girls) but the original story was published in Young Animal, a Japanese magazine for teenage boys. It would be more accurate to bill this series as a realistic harem series as opposed to the fantastical harem stories like Tenchi Muyo or Love Hina. The story centers around Kaoru Hanabishi, a college student, who is struggling to make ends meet after walking away from his position as heir to the Hanabishi marketing empire. One day he meets a traditional Japanese girl who seems totally out of place and lost in the modern world, and he stops to help her. She turns out to be Aoi Sakabura, a childhood friend, who was betrothed to Kaoru when they were both young children, and Aoi has run away from her sheltered home to find Kaoru. As the series progresses, one girl after another joins Kaoru's circle of friends, each of the girls developing strong feeling for Kaoru and unaware of Kaoru and Aoi's love for each other. There is no magical girls in this series, no giant robots blowing things up, it's all about the relationships of the characters with each other. And because of this realism, the series can be a real heartbreaker because, if you read the manga before watching the anime, you realize that all but one of these girls are going to end up brokenhearted.This is an excellent series for introducing a girl friend or a wife to anime. Be aware, however, that the series may not appropriate for children. Aoi-chan is nude in the opening sequence, Tina is very fond of grabbing women's breast, Taeko-chan provides an excess of panty shots and the youngest character in the harem seems to garner the most partially nude scenes. There are a couple episodes towards the end where Aoi and Kaoru spend the night together and it is suggested that they finally fulfill their love for each other, though nothing is shown. Your kids will see worse on prime time television. There is nothing outright dirty or pornographic, though you might want to view the series before airing it for your children to be safe.Some people might find Aoi-chan's supposed submissiveness disturbing, but her behavior should be viewed through the lens of Japanese culture. She was raised in fading traditions of ancient Japan and behaves accordingly, and shows unusual strength, for a traditional Japanese girl, in defying the wishes of her father and family and pursuing Kaoru even after their engagement was broken. She is a complex character, giving and selfless, while at the same time being a bit childish and selfish in her singleminded pursuit of Kaoru.Other characters flirt on edge of becoming cliche harem characters, the klutzy maid, the boorish foreigner, the snobbish rich girl, the aloof and superior older woman, the overly affectionate and innocent Junior High student. Each of them get at least part of their back-story told in an episode, and manage to avoid being stereotyped in the end. If you don't mind the fan service, and can get past Aoi's housewifeyness, this is a good story that you might enjoy, especially if you are tired of magical girls, pretty boys and giant transforming robots.Like most of Pioneer/Geneon's offerings the extras are rather slim - a couple bonus episodes, creditless openings and closings, and reversible liners with a trifle more risque picture on one side than another. The anime series left me with one unanswered question - the opening sequence of Enishi shows a young woman holding a blue haired infant girl for a brief instance. This woman and baby don't show up in any of the episodes or in the manga, which makes me wonder what she was doing in the opening of the show. Perhaps Enishi was intended to be a longer series, like the first story arc, but was shortened for various reasons, after the opening sequence was filmed, and the unused characters were not removed.",5,"Not too tart, not too sweet",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,4145,"['Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'Enishi', 'are', 'better', 'offerings', 'Pioneer/Geneon', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'happen', 'find', 'available', 'series', 'closely', 'manga', 'Kou', 'Fumizuki', 'story', 'art', 'are', 'slightly', 'simplified', 'video', 'manga', 'anime', 'have', 'been', 'mistaken', 'shojo', 'manga', 'anime', 'girls', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'published', 'Young', 'Animal', 'Japanese', 'magazine', 'teenage', 'boys', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'bill', 'series', 'realistic', 'harem', 'series', 'opposed', 'fantastical', 'harem', 'stories', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'Hina', 'story', 'centers', 'Kaoru', 'Hanabishi', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'walking', 'away', 'position', 'heir', 'Hanabishi', 'marketing', 'empire', 'One', 'day', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'who', 'totally', 'place', 'lost', 'modern', 'world', 'help', 'out', 'be', 'Aoi', 'Sakabura', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'betrothed', 'Kaoru', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'children', 'Aoi', 'run', 'away', 'sheltered', 'home', 'find', 'Kaoru', 'series', 'one', 'girl', 'Kaoru', 'circle', 'friends', 'girls', 'developing', 'strong', 'feeling', 'Kaoru', 'unaware', 'Kaoru', 'Aoi', 'love', 'other', 'magical', 'girls', 'series', 'giant', 'robots', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'relationships', 'characters', 'other', 'realism', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'heartbreaker', 'read', 'manga', 'watching', 'anime', 'realize', 'one', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'brokenhearted.This', 'excellent', 'series', 'introducing', 'girl', 'friend', 'wife', 'anime', 'Be', 'aware', 'however', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', 'Aoi-chan', 'nude', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Tina', 'very', 'fond', 'grabbing', 'women', 'breast', 'Taeko-chan', 'excess', 'panty', 'shots', 'youngest', 'character', 'harem', 'garner', 'most', 'partially', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'episodes', 'end', 'where', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'suggested', 'finally', 'fulfill', 'love', 'other', 'nothing', 'shown', 'kids', 'will', 'see', 'worse', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'nothing', 'outright', 'dirty', 'pornographic', 'might', 'want', 'view', 'series', 'airing', 'children', 'be', 'safe.Some', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'Aoi-chan', 'supposed', 'submissiveness', 'disturbing', 'behavior', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'lens', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'was', 'raised', 'fading', 'traditions', 'ancient', 'Japan', 'behaves', 'accordingly', 'unusual', 'strength', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'defying', 'wishes', 'father', 'family', 'pursuing', 'Kaoru', 'even', 'engagement', 'was', 'broken', 'complex', 'character', 'giving', 'selfless', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'bit', 'childish', 'selfish', 'singleminded', 'pursuit', 'Kaoru.Other', 'characters', 'flirt', 'edge', 'becoming', 'cliche', 'harem', 'characters', 'klutzy', 'maid', 'boorish', 'foreigner', 'snobbish', 'rich', 'girl', 'aloof', 'superior', 'older', 'woman', 'overly', 'affectionate', 'innocent', 'Junior', 'High', 'student', 'get', 'least', 'part', 'back-story', 'told', 'episode', 'manage', 'avoid', 'being', 'stereotyped', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fan', 'service', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'Aoi', 'housewifeyness', 'good', 'story', 'might', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'are', 'tired', 'magical', 'girls', 'pretty', 'boys', 'giant', 'transforming', 'robots.Like', 'most', 'Pioneer/Geneon', 'offerings', 'extras', 'are', 'rather', 'slim', 'couple', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'creditless', 'openings', 'closings', 'reversible', 'liners', 'trifle', 'more', 'risque', 'picture', 'one', 'side', 'anime', 'series', 'left', 'one', 'unanswered', 'question', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Enishi', 'young', 'woman', 'holding', 'blue', 'haired', 'infant', 'girl', 'brief', 'instance', 'woman', 'baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'episodes', 'manga', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'opening', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'Enishi', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'longer', 'series', 'first', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'shortened', 'various', 'reasons', 'opening', 'sequence', 'was', 'filmed', 'unused', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'removed']",Ai Yori Aoshi + Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi - Complete Set
