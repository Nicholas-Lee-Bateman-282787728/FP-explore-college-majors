Once again based in Bristol, this is about partners Aaron (Connor McKenzy) and Seb (Alex Anthony). They have both come a cropper, job wise in the economic downturn that the banking crisis has caused, but as neither of them are bankers there is no Government bail out to keep them in jobs.As the bills pile up and the beloved Mini gets repossessed ( I have one and love it too) Aaron hits on a novel way to make some cash, he will film their love making and post it on inter net `interactive hand relief' site `Hot X Buns'. He is amazed as the money starts to roll in, but he hasn't told Seb. Well he finds out anyway and after issues of trust are sorted out they agree to carry on.Enter ex flat mate and sexually complicated Jem (Jessica Mathews), she knows a bit about inter web pay per view as she has been working in Thailand quite well known for its liberal attitudes to all things kinky. She decides to spice things up and spice them she does. We also have a hot neighbour Mitch who does a great homage to the `Cool Hand Luke' car washing scene, only this time it is window cleaning and pumping up a tyre - fab.This is a very funny, laugh out loud movie, that has a big feel good factor and some brilliant one liners, we even get golfing innuendo - `hole in one' etc. A brilliant sex toy shop which has the most nervous tissue monkey I have ever seen. The bedroom scenes are a bit on the tame side; with far too much duvet than is necessary for decency purposes and the music by `Nancy' is a bit sugary but really gets better.Writers and directors Daren Flaxstone and Christopher martin have made something to be proud of and I wish them all the best for the next venture. Fans of Andrew Christian clothing are in for a treat as that is all they seem to wear including in bed and make a note of the background as we have some great touches like an advert for their bank `Gapingwide' (a play on building society/bank Nationwide for non UK types).Whilst a comedy it deals with other issues too and is quite grown up about how it deals with emotions during stress and how far we can go when trust is abused.
