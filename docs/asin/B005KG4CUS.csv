The last time I saw color used this beautifully was in the film ""El Norte"". This is a real and touching story and is in fact quite different from the book.  But it's not a book folks.  IT'S A MOVIE.  A movie is a director's realm and the director has the creative license to create an entirely new story or to adapt, create, or change from a novel, an idea, a short story, a painting or any other art form. Please, try to remember that a film is not a book.  It is a photographic creation.  To criticize a film because it is different from it's literary inspiration is as ridiculous as criticizing a movie based on historical events if it deviates from historical facts.

1463770,A32T2H8150OJLU,B005KG4CUS,ARH,"[10, 11]","My wife, 12-yr old daughter, 21-yr old daughter and I just watched this film.  My wife and older daughter read the book and both proclaimed it ""fantastic.""  When we watched the movie they both mentioned that it was not like the book in many ways.  This does not mean, however, that it's a bad movie.  On the contrary, I found it to be both compelling and worthy.I was particularly interested in watching this movie because I have lived in the orient and I was eager to see how it would be depicted.  There is something that most Americans do not understand, and that is that oriental cultures have histories and deep-seated traditions that Americans have a difficult time imagining.  This movie is about one such custom - a custom where young women bind themselves to one another in a life-long mutually supportive relationship.These relationships were vital to the happiness of many Chinese women, especially those of higher social status.  Marriage for them was almost always a matter of an arrangement for social status, wealth, alliances between families, etc.  They were seldom marriages of love, at least initially.  The primary role of women in that society was to provide their husbands with social status and sons.  Since this is the case, women of status relied heavily on female-female relationships for emotional support.This film depicts this sort of relationship, and involved three interwoven story lines - one set in early 1800s China, one set in modern Shanghai, and one set about a decade or so earlier than today.As you watch the film you will see parallels between the story lines, and the same two women play the main characters in all three story lines.  I found that to be a memorable part of the film.I found the cinematography, the acting, and the story lines to be compelling and meaningful.  The flow of the movie would be seen by some viewers as plodding, but I found the pacing to be extremely appropriate for the story being told.  I thought that the settings of the stories, the relationships portrayed, and the overall experience were memorable.I am extremely glad I watched this film, and I would be happy to watch it again.If you are looking for gunplay, explosions, and lots of special effects...keep walking.  If, however, you are looking for a meaningful story, a piece of historical fiction, and a memorable experience, then this film may be for you.5 stars!

1463771,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B005KG4CUS,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[2, 4]","This film was a complete surprise for me. I found out, after watching it, that it is based on a novel written by Lisa See. I myself have never read this book so I was quite in the dark. From the very start I was enchanted with this movie and it stayed with me until the very end. If you are going to watch this film make sure you have a box of tissues handy for this film has very intense moments. The film is divided into three different time periods, yet is not in anyway confusing. As you travel through 19th century China you meet Lilly and Snow Flower, brought up together by an arranged Chinese friendship, due to an old Chinese ritual. Back in the 90's, Nina and Sophia, descendants of Lilly and Snow Flower who are childhood friends also grow up together in their more modern way. There is also the present, as when later as adults, Nina and Sophia lose touch with one another until a tragedy teaches one that the bond and love of friendship is more important than anything else in life. The beautiful scenery filmed in Shanghai is amazing and the music is beautiful. Even after watching the special features and listening to how it was filmed, it still left me breathless. I loved how the old Chinese tale was woven with the more contemporary parts of the film. The film goes back and forth amongst the two different generations, however I found the 19th Century parts of the film more emotional and interesting. This is a film for one to share with ones daughters, sisters and anyone with whom one may share that special bond with. It also makes a great gift.

1463775,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B005KG4CUS,Brian E. Erland,"[51, 57]","Let me begin by saying I have not read Lisa See's book upon which this film is based, hence I'm not in the category of other reviewers who disliked this movie primarily because of its deviation from the novel. Translating a work of art from one medium to another is a difficult task at the very least and it comes as no surprise to discover that a person who loves something in one medium is seldom pleased with its appearance in another. Personally I think a film should be judged solely on its own merits, like it or dislike it for what it is, not for what you thought or hoped it would be.Having said that I would like to convey how much I loved this film. Director Wayne Wang instilled `Snow Flower and the Secret Fan' with the same depth of emotion and sensitivity that made his `Joy Luck Club' such a moving and memorable viewing experience.The storyline moves neatly back and forth between two sets of Chinese women living in different times (Lily and Snow Flower in 1829 China, Nina and Sophia in present day Shanghai). Though time and place differ, the shared cultural and spiritual bonds formed by their mutual `vows of sisterhood' are identical and timeless. Bingbing Li plays the parts of both Lily and Nina and Gianna Jun the dual roles of Snow Flower and Sophia. Both story lines are engaging but clearly the Snow Flower and Lily tale is the more important of the two. Nevertheless the present day friendship between Nina and Sophia is essential to the intent of the film, providing not only context to the earlier friendship but a cultural bridge between past, present and future. In other words, while everything around us is constantly changing what's really important in life remains the same.I strongly recommend this film; the storyline, dialogue, soundtrack, visuals and cast all make for a well spent evening of viewing entertainment. The only warning I would level is to say that this is, like `Joy Luck Club' a chick flick so gentlemen view at your own risk.",5,"""I Wrap, I Bind"" ~ Exploring The Depth Of Sisterly Love",1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1982,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Lisa', 'See', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'hence', ""'m"", 'not', 'category', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'disliked', 'movie', 'primarily', 'deviation', 'novel', 'Translating', 'work', 'art', 'one', 'medium', 'difficult', 'task', 'very', 'least', 'surprise', 'discover', 'person', 'who', 'something', 'one', 'medium', 'seldom', 'pleased', 'appearance', 'Personally', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'solely', 'own', 'merits', 'dislike', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'hoped', 'would', 'be.Having', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'convey', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'film', 'Director', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'instilled', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'Secret', 'Fan', 'same', 'depth', 'emotion', 'sensitivity', 'made', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'such', 'moving', 'memorable', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'storyline', 'moves', 'neatly', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'sets', 'Chinese', 'women', 'living', 'different', 'times', 'Lily', 'Snow', 'Flower', '1829', 'China', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'present', 'day', 'Shanghai', 'time', 'place', 'differ', 'shared', 'cultural', 'spiritual', 'bonds', 'formed', 'mutual', 'vows', 'sisterhood', 'are', 'identical', 'timeless', 'Bingbing', 'Li', 'parts', 'Lily', 'Nina', 'Gianna', 'Jun', 'dual', 'roles', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'Sophia', 'Both', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'engaging', 'clearly', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'Lily', 'tale', 'more', 'important', 'two', 'present', 'day', 'friendship', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'essential', 'intent', 'film', 'providing', 'not', 'only', 'context', 'earlier', 'friendship', 'cultural', 'bridge', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'other', 'words', 'everything', 'constantly', 'changing', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'same.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'visuals', 'cast', 'make', 'well', 'spent', 'evening', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'only', 'warning', 'would', 'level', 'say', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'chick', 'flick', 'gentlemen', 'view', 'own', 'risk']",N/A

1463786,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005KG4CUS,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN is the cinematic adaptation of Lisa See's popular novel by writers Angela Workman,  Ron Bass and Michael K. Ray and director Wayne Wang.  The film unveils parallel stories between 19th century China and present day Shanghai - the tales of two women joined by laotong - a binding vow and contract to be eternal friends and share each others lives - communicating with a secret women's language called nu shu, carefully inked characters placed on the folds between the spines of a silken fan.  By using the same actresses to play the parts of the girls two centuries apart adds a mysterious beauty to the films alluring flavor.In 1826 Lily and Snow Flower become laotung and though they are from opposite ends of the social stratum they become devoted friends, undergoing the ritual of having their feet broken and bound to remain  very small as adults - apparently a desired attribute for physical attraction as a potential bride.  The poor girl is chosen for marriage by a wealthy family and the rich girl is promised to a butcher, an extreme reversal of roles in society and it is the manner in which each adapts and aids the other that demonstrates the depth of the bond of laotong.  Concurrently in the film we meet Nina and Sophie in contemporary Shanghai: Nina has gained education and stature and is due to move to New York as part of an important business.  Sophie is in an accident and only slowly do we realize that Sophie had the promise of moving to Australia to marry an Aussie singer (Hugh Jackman), more because she is pregnant than for love. Because of the laotung between Nina and Sophie the two make sacrifices that overcome all else to prove their loyalty. There are many parallels in the two stories that show a bond between the two sets of girls and to capture this bond securely the two girls form centuries apart are played by the same actresses: Lily/Nina become the roles of Bing Bing Li and Snow Flower/Sophie are portrayed by Gianna Jun.  The supporting cast is carefully chosen and uniformly fine.The sets and costumes and music enhance this film significantly.  It is not a great epic of a movie, but it has a tender and touching story that is very well told by everyone involved.

1463787,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005KG4CUS,G. Teslovich,"[1, 2]","Is it a book?I was once a purist and thought art only belongs to the artist then I discovered that without an audience to interpret - it isn't art. So I also once thought that symbol based runes called words shouldn't be subverted by some visual/auditory medium called a movie. Then I discovered an interview between the author of a book and the director of it's movie interpretation.  The author was pleased that the movie provided what the book couldn't - the visuals, sounds as well as a more complex character and more of the plot and settings for which words were inadequate. The director said that the movie by it's nature couldn't be just another book but it actually is a unique creation and experience. So, my response to those that didn't like the movie because it wasn't a book is to just not watch the movie.Is it a love story?Yes, it's about Laotong which is the life long bond and support between two girls that is equivalent to being sisters forever. The storyline for this ""forever"" is found in the lives of two girls in feudal 1850s -'60s China and in parallel two girls in 2010. In both periods the girls come from different socio-economic families and in both periods they end up as women with a reversal of those statuses.Is it about oppression?Yes, the girls are shown being prepared to be married and I paraphrase from the movie,""There is no purer ambition for a woman than to be a better wife.""By magnificent scripting we find one of the 2010 woman preparing an exhibit on China's outlawing of foot binding where a girl, usually around the age of 10, has her feet broken and bound in cloth so that they fit within a 3"" lotus shoe. A practice that is shown taking place with our 1850s girls. Seeing that pain makes the movie better than the book and to further the story we cannot help but see how our 2010 women seem to be painfully bound to their high heels. In feudal CHina (Some say it's still down in a few rural areas.) it not only helped to restrain the female to the house but to increase her sexual attractiveness. Sound familiar!Overview:I commend the actors for their excellent portrayals; the script writers for their timeless blending and contemporization of both the life-long love and the oppression that women face in this world; to the director for the flawless editing/blending of the lives in these two time periods. Also presented was a sub-story of the brutal Taiping rebellion which would have separated the sexes; outlawed foot binding, Buddhism, Confucianism and imposed Christianity.",5,A Movie is Not a Book,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2530,"['book', 'was', 'once', 'purist', 'thought', 'art', 'only', 'artist', 'then', 'discovered', 'audience', 'interpret', ""n't"", 'art', 'also', 'once', 'thought', 'symbol', 'based', 'runes', 'called', 'words', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'subverted', 'visual/auditory', 'medium', 'called', 'movie', 'Then', 'discovered', 'interview', 'author', 'book', 'director', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'author', 'was', 'pleased', 'movie', 'provided', 'what', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'visuals', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'more', 'plot', 'settings', 'words', 'were', 'inadequate', 'director', 'said', 'movie', 'nature', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'book', 'actually', 'unique', 'creation', 'experience', 'So', 'response', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'just', 'not', 'watch', 'movie.Is', 'love', 'story', 'Yes', 'Laotong', 'life', 'long', 'bond', 'support', 'two', 'girls', 'equivalent', 'being', 'sisters', 'forever', 'storyline', 'forever', 'found', 'lives', 'two', 'girls', 'feudal', '1850s', ""-'60s"", 'China', 'parallel', 'two', 'girls', '2010', 'periods', 'girls', 'come', 'different', 'socio-economic', 'families', 'periods', 'end', 'up', 'women', 'reversal', 'statuses.Is', 'oppression', 'Yes', 'girls', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'prepared', 'be', 'married', 'paraphrase', 'movie', 'purer', 'ambition', 'woman', 'be', 'better', 'wife', 'magnificent', 'scripting', 'find', 'one', '2010', 'woman', 'preparing', 'exhibit', 'China', 'outlawing', 'foot', 'binding', 'where', 'girl', 'usually', 'age', '10', 'feet', 'broken', 'bound', 'so', 'fit', '3', 'lotus', 'shoe', 'practice', 'shown', 'taking', 'place', '1850s', 'girls', 'Seeing', 'pain', 'movie', 'better', 'book', 'further', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'see', 'how', '2010', 'women', 'seem', 'be', 'painfully', 'bound', 'high', 'heels', 'feudal', 'CHina', 'say', 'still', 'down', 'few', 'rural', 'areas', 'not', 'only', 'helped', 'restrain', 'female', 'house', 'increase', 'sexual', 'attractiveness', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Overview', 'commend', 'actors', 'excellent', 'portrayals', 'script', 'writers', 'timeless', 'blending', 'contemporization', 'life-long', 'love', 'oppression', 'women', 'face', 'world', 'director', 'flawless', 'editing/blending', 'lives', 'two', 'time', 'periods', 'Also', 'presented', 'was', 'sub-story', 'brutal', 'Taiping', 'rebellion', 'would', 'have', 'separated', 'sexes', 'outlawed', 'foot', 'binding', 'Buddhism', 'Confucianism', 'imposed', 'Christianity']",N/A

And that it is said to be two ""parallel"" stories is an overstatement, and perhaps even something of a misperception: if one watches closely one sees it is actually one story, and told chronologically; it almost doesn't matter which scenes are past, and which present.  This is made clear in the final scene: there is change in everything -- except for the deep-hearted love of ""laotong"" sisters; that never changes.Wayne Wang is a ""genre""-hopping director with an unusual catalog.  It includes such films as ""Chan is Missing,"" the fascinating ""tour"" of San Francisco's Chinatown; the fully American/Hollywood ""Maid in Manhattan,"" with Jennifer Lopez, and a film with Queen Latifah; and ""Chinese-American"" films, ""Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart,"" ""A Bowl of Tea,"" and ""The Princess of Nebraska"".

Well worth the price.)The only other film in which I've seen Li Bingbing is ""The Message,"" a good film in which she is very good (also includes the wonderful Zhou Xun).  In this she is excellent (and essentially has the lead role).  Also notable in a smaller role is Vivian Wu (excellent in ""The Soong Sisters,"" though the film is stolen from her and Michelle Yeoh by a phenomenal Maggie Cheung.)A moving film, powerfully emotional, almost from the very beginning.  And it is not a ""chick flick"" for men who are fascinated with and appreciative of mother-daughter relationships (Wang's ""Joy Luck Club""), and (especially) sister-sister relationships (regardless whether the sisters are ""blood"" sisters).  Or for anyone who appreciates unique historical storytelling, with an Asian/Chinese philosophical ""core,"" and excellent writing, acting, and cinematography.Recommended for those who would make up their own minds instead of relying on the misleading negative reviews.

1463799,A1NIQTNAHXDX3W,B005KG4CUS,"LH ""Lilia""","[9, 10]","Let me start by saying that I haven't read the book, and no, it's still not a good movie. I am from China, and I happened to have received a university grant to study Nu Shu in Hunan Province over ten years ago with one of my best friends at the time - it was sort of our ""laotong"" experience, though we have since grown apart but that's another story. Just like ""Joy Luck Club,"" this movie is made for non-Chinese viewers and has little to no authenticity and the characters were based so much on stereotypes. When I studied Nu Shu at the time, there was only one and a half people alive that could write Nu Shu - one woman and a male scholar who counted as a half person because Nu Shu was invented by and for women. So there is NO WAY that in modern days two high school girls could be writing notes back and forth in Nu Shu in Shanghai! And what is that aunt person who supposedly knew so much about Nu Shu and had the girls formalize a contract??? No, average people in modern Shanghai don't know anything about Nu Shu or laotong - it's something that is much more well-known outside China unfortunately.Also, a note to the creators of the movie - CHINESE PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH TO EACH OTHER! Yes, Li Bingbing, who played one of the main leads, spoke English in that Jet Li and Jackie Chan movie ""The Forbidden Kingdom"", but that movie was at least set in America to begin with and has an American lead, so it's kind of understandable. But honestly I was thinking ""WTF?"" when the nurse called to tell about the accident in English. China is not India - we weren't colonized so that English became the official language. Some authenticity of Chinese people speaking Chinese would be nice!And what drab dialogues! It felt like the English dialogues were written by Chinese people who just learned English in an ESL class! There was no depth to the dialogues. And the supporting actors all felt like real amateurs because when they spoke Chinese their accents weren't even very good. In the setting in Hunan, the people all spoke with a Shanghai accent. They just don't sound like trained professional actors. And I agree with another reviewer: what's with Hugh Jackman playing such a minor and ridiculous part in the movie? Gianna Jun is wildly popular in China, but she is not Chinese. No, Koreans are not Chinese! During the 19th century part, her role had to be dubbed because she clearly did not speak Chinese. It's like having a Spanish actress trying to act American - again, no authenticity.Also some background knowledge on Nu Shu: Yes, the movie did it justice by portraying how it was embroidered into fabric and how it was always done in a poetic format. But, to think that a traditional match-maker would be the one to teach the girls Nu Shu was again, ridiculous. Writing and communicating in Nu Shu was meant to be a rebellious and secretive act amongst women at the time who couldn't go to school like their male counterparts. It was in no ways taught in public. A traditional match-maker would have been horrified to even acknowledge such act existed, since it would make the girls much less desirable by men.It's sad when such movies are made about China for non-Chinese audience, because things in the movie can be taken as true about China, and they are not. I don't know if this movie was even released in China, but I know for a fact that the Chinese would have no patience for such a pretentious tale.There have only been a couple of movies made about China that are authentic and non-judgmental, including Ang Lee's amazing ""Lust, Caution"" and the classic ""Red Violin"" which has a segment about the Cultural Revolution in China, a difficult topic, that was well developed and truthful.

I'd hoped to see the beautiful story on the written page come to life on the screen.I was utterly disappointed.The movie is split between what occurs in the book (the story of Snow Flower and Lily) and a modern parallel story that never occurs in the book at all. I didn't want to see a ""modernized"" version of this amazing story. I wanted to see the story itself! The constant interruption between the past and present stories was irritating and disruptive to the beautifully sad tale of Snow Flower and Lily.In addition, and perhaps because the movie writers decided to massacre the book by making the movie a half-modern parallel, there isn't enough time to tell Snow Flower and Lily's tale at all. Scenes are short, abrupt, jumping years ahead within minutes of each other. It might have been more effective if there'd been some narration by Lily to explain what was happening in certain scenes, and why. Someone who hasn't read the book won't understand entire portions of the story, especially if they know nothing about Chinese culture and history. Gripping sections of the book, such as the foot-binding of the girls, which is described in agonizing detail, in the movie is just a short 30-second glimpse that reveals nothing of the prolonged agony these children suffered (2 full years of being confined while their feet ""healed"" from the mutilation). The scenes where the families flee from the rebellion are brief, showing nothing of the horror, death, starvation, and struggle for survival (except one brief glimpse of a child dying). Lily's first meeting with her husband is completely different from the book (in the book, he was shy, polite, and kind). Lily's pride and naivety, and eventual self-examination and humility, are never portrayed at all.Bottom line: just read the book. The movie is like someone took the book, chopped it into pieces, then tried to superglue it back together, and in all the wrong places, with half the pieces missing. The book is beautiful.

I missed the theatrical run, and so waited patiently for it come out on DVD. Unfortunately, this is a terrible adaptation of a heartbreakingly beautiful work, taking too many artistic liberties, and butchering the story in such a manner as to render it incomprehensible to those who read and loved the book. If you watch this movie without having read the book, then it might appeal on some level, but to those who savored the detailed descriptions of traditions in 19th century China, and the close bond between the two central characters, i.e. Snow Flower and Lily, this movie seems such an aberration and I truly felt let down.The movie takes a different approach than the novel in that it has two parallel story lines - one set in the present featuring two young women who are kindred spirits, but whose friendship is eventually strained by conflicting ideas regarding relationships, lifestyle, etc. On the same day that she receives news that she has a job opportunity in New York, Nina (Li BingBing) receives news that her estranged best friend, Sophia (Gianna Jun) has been in an accident and is in hospital. As Nina goes through Sophia's things at the hospital, she comes across a manuscript, parts of a story of two women in 19th century China, whose friendship mirror Nina and Sophia's own close bond.The trouble is that this parallel storyline does not work - by dividing the story up into two disparate timelines, not much time is spent in developing the central characters. The most affected here is the story in the present - viewers are given brief glimpses of Nina and Sophia bonding over music etc. but their friendship is meant to be an unbreakable bond and this is not credibly portrayed. The story of the two laotongs or ""old sames"" (sort of like sisters of the heart) set in 19th century China is much more credibly portrayed, ironically played by the same actresses playing the parts of Nina and Sophia in the present.Lily and Snow Flower are the laotongs, coming from two very different social classes. The poorer of the two, Lily, has her feet bound to perfection under the supervision of a zealous mother. The scenes of foot binding are rather uncomfortable to watch, but they are nowhere near as gruesome as the graphic descriptions provided by Ms. See in her novel. Lily's perfect lotus bud feet eventually garner her a very advantageous marriage, but poor Snow Flower ends up being married off to a butcher despite her rich beginnings.In the novel, readers are given a deep insight into the secret language of women, i.e. nushu which provides an intimate glimpse into the lives of women in 19th century China (historically nushu was the language used by the women of the Yao ethnic minority). Reading between the lines, readers get the idea that it is Snow Flower who has a more interesting sex life than Lily, but in the movie, viewers get a brief glimpse of this, not through nushu, but of Lily playing peeping tom. It just completely put me off - such short cuts when it was completely unnecessary, not to mention detracting from the very essence of the novel.Then there's the disaster in the form of Aussie actor Hugh Jackman (it begs the question, why did he stoop to such a role in the first place?). Any actor could have played his role, but I guess the filmmakers thought they could get the movie more exposure with a star presence? Jackman plays Sophia's on-off lover and his most 'memorable' scene here is him serenading Sophia at a party and indulging in some serious liplocking. Sigh...need I continue?Final verdict - fans of the novel should steer away from this disaster of an adaptation, and those who haven't read the book will probably not miss much, though I'd recommend the book over the movie anytime.",2,Fails to capture the gentle nuances found in the book,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,3909,"['Having', 'read', 'loved', 'Lisa', ""See'sSnow"", 'Flower', 'Secret', 'Fan', 'Novel', 'Random', 'House', 'Reader', 'Circle', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'missed', 'theatrical', 'run', 'so', 'waited', 'patiently', 'out', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'terrible', 'adaptation', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'work', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'butchering', 'story', 'such', 'manner', 'render', 'incomprehensible', 'who', 'read', 'loved', 'book', 'watch', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'might', 'appeal', 'level', 'who', 'savored', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'traditions', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'close', 'bond', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'Lily', 'movie', 'such', 'aberration', 'truly', 'felt', 'let', 'down.The', 'movie', 'different', 'approach', 'novel', 'two', 'parallel', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'set', 'present', 'featuring', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'strained', 'conflicting', 'ideas', 'regarding', 'relationships', 'lifestyle', 'etc', 'same', 'day', 'news', 'job', 'opportunity', 'New', 'York', 'Nina', 'Li', 'BingBing', 'news', 'estranged', 'best', 'friend', 'Sophia', 'Gianna', 'Jun', 'been', 'accident', 'hospital', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'things', 'hospital', 'manuscript', 'parts', 'story', 'two', 'women', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'friendship', 'mirror', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'own', 'close', 'bond.The', 'trouble', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'not', 'work', 'dividing', 'story', 'up', 'two', 'disparate', 'timelines', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'developing', 'central', 'characters', 'most', 'affected', 'here', 'story', 'present', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'bonding', 'music', 'etc', 'friendship', 'meant', 'be', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'not', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'story', 'two', 'laotongs', 'old', 'sames', 'sort', 'sisters', 'heart', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'much', 'more', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'ironically', 'played', 'same', 'playing', 'parts', 'Nina', 'Sophia', 'present.Lily', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'are', 'laotongs', 'coming', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'social', 'classes', 'poorer', 'two', 'Lily', 'feet', 'perfection', 'supervision', 'zealous', 'mother', 'scenes', 'foot', 'binding', 'are', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'gruesome', 'graphic', 'descriptions', 'provided', 'Ms.', 'See', 'novel', 'Lily', 'perfect', 'lotus', 'bud', 'feet', 'eventually', 'garner', 'very', 'advantageous', 'marriage', 'poor', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'up', 'being', 'married', 'butcher', 'rich', 'beginnings.In', 'novel', 'readers', 'are', 'given', 'deep', 'insight', 'secret', 'language', 'women', 'i.e', 'intimate', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'women', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'historically', 'was', 'language', 'used', 'women', 'Yao', 'ethnic', 'minority', 'Reading', 'lines', 'readers', 'get', 'idea', 'Snow', 'Flower', 'who', 'more', 'interesting', 'sex', 'life', 'Lily', 'movie', 'viewers', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'not', 'nushu', 'Lily', 'playing', 'peeping', 'tom', 'just', 'completely', 'put', 'off', 'such', 'short', 'cuts', 'when', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'mention', 'detracting', 'very', 'essence', 'novel.Then', 'disaster', 'form', 'Aussie', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'stoop', 'role', 'first', 'place', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'exposure', 'star', 'presence', 'Jackman', 'Sophia', 'on-off', 'lover', 'most', ""'memorable"", 'scene', 'here', 'serenading', 'Sophia', 'party', 'indulging', 'serious', 'liplocking', 'Sigh', 'need', 'continue', 'Final', 'verdict', 'fans', 'novel', 'should', 'steer', 'away', 'disaster', 'adaptation', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'miss', 'much', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'book', 'movie', 'anytime']",N/A
