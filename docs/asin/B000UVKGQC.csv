The comedy, the stroylines, the cleverness in bringing new light to old fairytale characters, the sidekicks. Its all a fun ride.Now, for each movie:Shrek--5/5--This is the best in the franchise. Mostly becuase the storyline is more straightforward, and the characters are allowed more screentime. The villan is hilarious (the Gingy torture scene is priceless). Donkey is at his best in this installment.Shrek 2--5/5--This one is equally as funny as the originl. And, I found myself loving the fairy godmother. I loved Puss-in-Boots, and he totally outshines Donkey here. The storyline is a bit boring, but they make up for it in comedy.Shrek 3--4/5--I was not at all happy with this installment. But, still found teh comedy to be top-notch. My favorite addition this timearound was the Princesses and Mr. Merlin. That was a treat. But, Justin Timberlak fell flat. And, I did not like the ending--too sugary and cliche. And the villan was not as interesting as the previous ones. Overall, the first 2 were the best. But, this one is a nice comedy to enjoy as well.A few people have regarded the trilogy as family comedy, and maybe so. But there are many references to things that would definately go over a child's head. And, that is the genuis of this franchise. The subtle jokes make the comedy that much funnier.The trilogy is full of top-notch comedy and overall a 5/5.shrek",5,Shrek Is Awesome...,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1417,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'aboutt', 'hese', 'movies', 'comedy', 'stroylines', 'cleverness', 'bringing', 'new', 'light', 'old', 'fairytale', 'characters', 'sidekicks', 'fun', 'ride.Now', 'movie', 'Shrek', '5/5', 'best', 'franchise', 'Mostly', 'storyline', 'more', 'straightforward', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'more', 'screentime', 'villan', 'hilarious', 'Gingy', 'torture', 'scene', 'priceless', 'Donkey', 'best', 'installment.Shrek', '2', '5/5', 'one', 'equally', 'as', 'funny', 'originl', 'found', 'loving', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'loved', 'Puss-in-Boots', 'totally', 'Donkey', 'here', 'storyline', 'bit', 'boring', 'make', 'up', 'comedy.Shrek', '3', '4/5', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'installment', 'still', 'found', 'teh', 'comedy', 'be', 'top-notch', 'favorite', 'addition', 'timearound', 'was', 'Princesses', 'Mr.', 'Merlin', 'was', 'treat', 'Justin', 'Timberlak', 'fell', 'flat', 'did', 'not', 'ending', 'too', 'sugary', 'cliche', 'villan', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'previous', 'ones', 'Overall', 'first', '2', 'were', 'best', 'one', 'nice', 'comedy', 'enjoy', 'well.A', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'regarded', 'trilogy', 'family', 'comedy', 'maybe', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'references', 'things', 'would', 'definately', 'go', 'over', 'child', 'head', 'genuis', 'franchise', 'subtle', 'jokes', 'make', 'comedy', 'much', 'funnier.The', 'trilogy', 'full', 'top-notch', 'comedy', 'overall', '5/5.shrek']",The Shrek Trilogy: (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third)

Before this I didn't own the first two movies, and thought this was a great deal for all three. I thought it would make me a cool uncle to have all three movies when my nephew visits.The problem is I should have paid close attention to the screen format when ordering. I wrongly took it to mean that it was going to be in a wide screen format since it didn't specify full screen in the title. If I watched DVDs on a standard TV that might not be such a big deal, but I own a HDTV with an up-converting DVD player and prefer watching wide screen formated movies on it. They just look better on the screen.Sadly Amazon does not offer this set in a wide screen format. So I'm either going to make do with the set I just ordered.

They try to add a sophistication to Shreck One which frequently misfires for me such as the 'Devil in Prada' Fairy Godmother in Shreck Two. But there is sufficient delight in Puss in Boots, and Donkey with his strange liason to the oversized but loving dragon to hold one's interest, as do Shreck and Fiona. Unfortunately there is a current tendency to insert concepts and images of cruelty and degredation into many stories aimed at the young.

1096662,AER15RIMV8E6D,B000UVKGQC,Pumpkin Man,"[1, 1]","Shrek- This is a very good movie with a great storyline and perfect for the whole family. Shrek is an ogre who lives in a swamp by himself. He runs into a talkative donkey named Donkey. When Lord Farquaad forces other fairy tale creatures into the swamp, Shrek and Donkey go to Farquaad's castle to regain his privacy. Farquaad gives Shrek a task, he must go save Princess Fiona from a castle surrounded by lava and protected by a fire-breathing dragon so that Farquaad can marry her and become king. After he rescues her, he slowly begins to fall in love with her. I highly recoomend SHREK!!!Shrek 2- After their honeymoon, Shrek and Fiona are invited to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian. During their dinner, Harold is disgusted by Shrek's antics. Harold is soon visited by  Fairy Godmother, who is the mother of Prince Charming. Fairy Godmother is mad because Shrek was the one who saved Fiona from the castle in the original. She forces Harold to get rid of Shrek by any means necessary. He even hires a hairy assassin named Puss in Boots, but Puss soon changes sides and joins Shrek and Donkey. After taking a potion, Shrek and Fiona become real people, but Fiona has not yet seen Shrek, so Charming tries to convince her that he's Shrek. Will Shrek be able to stop him before midnight? I highly recommend SHREK 2!!!Shrek the Third- King Harold is on his death bed and wants Shrek to be the king, but Shrek thinks it's a bad idea, so he asks if there is an heir to the throne. It turns out that his nephew, Arthur Pendragon is in line to be the next king, so Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find him. While they are away, Prince Charming is planning revenge on Far Far Away and seeks help from the fairy tale villians. Will the gang be able to stop them?
