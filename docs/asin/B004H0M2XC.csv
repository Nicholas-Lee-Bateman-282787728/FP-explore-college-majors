I watched the preview and thought that my wife and I would enjoy some sort of mystery drama in the form of black cinema. Well I as many of you will be very disappointed. I purchased this on one of those"" people who brought ABC movie also may like or purchased XYZ movie"". From the gate this movie is confusing and never explains anything.  The entire cast made it seem as if this was a soft-core porn movie. Every scene is talking in a low sensual whisper and hints that we can all have sex as soon as we finish talking. People would literally be inches away form each other mouths doing that whisper talking. There were just too many things that did not make any sense. Why did the lead male go from Cool collective player (we are later told that it was role playing) to crying weak boy, to strong in control business owner, to etc...? Same thing happened with the wife. 1st she scared, then mad because he did not step his game up, to so hurt and broken by what he did, to etc...Then there is the sister, female friend(white girl) and the brother in law/boyfriend?? of the sister. None of their actions helped you understand the motives of why they all did what they did. There was no climax at the end to let you know all their motives. There is just s 2 minute conversation between the sisters. After that you're looking around saying ""what??? Is that it""???  Nothing comes together and you're just as lost as you were when the movie started. I stopped the DVD 15 times and rewind to see if I missed parts or did not see something. Nope.  2 stars because the effort and main ideal (at least from the previews) on what should have been a great movie. If this review looks and sounds crazy it's not. This is the way the movie plays out. I swear... You will understand if you see it. Maybe a rental if avail but not to buy unless your really looking to support these B actors.",2,Consinual confusion,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2012,"['Confusion', '****', 'My', 'last', '2', 'reviews', 'movie', 'never', 'posted', 'guess', 'was', 'too', 'hard', 'negative', 'review', '****', 'being', 'said', 'watched', 'preview', 'thought', 'wife', 'would', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'mystery', 'drama', 'form', 'black', 'cinema', 'Well', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'purchased', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'ABC', 'movie', 'also', 'may', 'like', 'purchased', 'XYZ', 'movie', 'gate', 'movie', 'confusing', 'never', 'anything', 'entire', 'cast', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'movie', 'scene', 'talking', 'low', 'sensual', 'whisper', 'hints', 'can', 'have', 'sex', 'as', 'soon', 'finish', 'talking', 'People', 'would', 'literally', 'be', 'inches', 'away', 'form', 'other', 'mouths', 'doing', 'talking', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'did', 'lead', 'male', 'go', 'Cool', 'collective', 'player', 'are', 'later', 'told', 'was', 'role', 'playing', 'crying', 'weak', 'boy', 'strong', 'control', 'business', 'owner', 'etc', 'Same', 'thing', 'happened', 'wife', '1st', 'scared', 'then', 'mad', 'did', 'not', 'step', 'game', 'up', 'so', 'hurt', 'broken', 'what', 'did', 'etc', 'Then', 'sister', 'female', 'friend', 'white', 'girl', 'brother', 'law/boyfriend', 'sister', 'None', 'actions', 'helped', 'understand', 'motives', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'climax', 'end', 'let', 'know', 'motives', 'just', 's', '2', 'minute', 'conversation', 'sisters', ""'re"", 'looking', 'saying', 'what', 'Nothing', 'together', ""'re"", 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'were', 'when', 'movie', 'started', 'stopped', 'DVD', '15', 'times', 'rewind', 'see', 'missed', 'parts', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'something', 'Nope', '2', 'stars', 'effort', 'main', 'ideal', 'least', 'previews', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'review', 'crazy', 'not', 'way', 'movie', 'out', 'swear', 'will', 'understand', 'see', 'Maybe', 'rental', 'avail', 'not', 'buy', 'really', 'looking', 'support', 'B', 'actors']",N/A

The movie was chocked full of bad actors, overacting, confusion and no plot.  I thought that I would be able to compare it to the movie ""Cover"" which was an excellent ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" movie. Not the case with Consinsual.  I actually turned it off, went to bed in hopes that when I finished it that the ending would be good.  NOT! The main character Terrance pays the detective hired to bump off the wife of Terrence so that he can get their restaurant franachise worth 2.5 mill. Wow he paid him a whopping 5000.00 to kill off the wife.  The brother in law, boyfriend, friend whatever he was to the wife's sister, that's how confusing it was, makes the deal with the wife's ex boyfriend  closes the deal then the husband Terrance pays him another whopping 5000.00.
