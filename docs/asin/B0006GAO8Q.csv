867389,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B0006GAO8Q,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[0, 0]","It's really hard for me to pick this film apart because I love the subject matter so much! Unfortunately, this film tries but, doesn't go the distance. John Favreau never quite convinced me he was the late champion, although I give him credit for going through enough physical conditioning to look like a boxer in the ring. The film starts towards the end of Marciano's life and jumps back and forth to tell the story of the Champ's rise to the title.One of the biggest problems is that they don't spend enough time in either time period at one time to let you get involved. It's certainly watch-able, but it's very superficial and I felt I was watching a sugar coated TV movie(barf). Why this man's story hasn't been made as a big production film is beyond me. It's an incredible story and it should be done properly. There's too much left out of this film and what's in this film seems fabricated.I give Jon Favreau props for doing this unlikely champion's story, but  not enough to call this a great bio. I rate it 2 1/2 stars.",2,"VERY WATCH-ABLE, BUT DISAPPOINTING BIO OF THE GREAT HEAVYWEIGHT! 2 1/2 STARS",1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,1030,"['really', 'hard', 'pick', 'film', 'apart', 'love', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'tries', ""n't"", 'go', 'distance', 'John', 'Favreau', 'never', 'quite', 'convinced', 'was', 'late', 'champion', 'give', 'credit', 'going', 'enough', 'physical', 'conditioning', 'look', 'boxer', 'ring', 'film', 'end', 'Marciano', 'life', 'jumps', 'back', 'forth', 'tell', 'story', 'Champ', 'rise', 'title.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'time', 'period', 'one', 'time', 'let', 'get', 'involved', 'certainly', 'watch-able', 'very', 'superficial', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'sugar', 'coated', 'TV', 'movie', 'barf', 'Why', 'man', 'story', ""n't"", 'been', 'made', 'big', 'production', 'film', 'incredible', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'properly', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'fabricated.I', 'give', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'doing', 'unlikely', 'champion', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'call', 'great', 'bio', 'rate', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

He didn't even try to study the real Mariano's speeach patterns or his mannerisims. I blame the director Winkler on this, The guy should stick to being a producer as his films as a director STINK! They tried to be Raging Bull instead it was RAGING BS!The boxing scenes were laughable. The music by Stanley Clark was over dramatic. Which is a shame as he is a terrific bass guitarist.I best stop and wash my eyes out after seeing this gold plated pile of pooh. It was the worst boxing film I'd seen in my life.

If your not familiar with Marciano you may like this simply as a decent piece of filmmaking, but if your looking for an accurate account of the real man, this isnt even close. The cast is okay (penelope miller, and john favreau, among others), but the writing is second rate and as I said, not at all true to the real life story of this great champion. Most egregious was the personality portrayal, a cockiness and even arrogance that was the complete opposite to the humble and soft spoken demeanor of the real Rocky. I dont understand why they didnt consult the family members for guidance because Rockys real life was certainly fascinating, and does not need to be exagerrated to provide interest. As others pointed out there were also events that just never happenned (visiting Louis in a hospital) . Besides the historical inaccuracies this movie really was just average in terms of entertainment. Someday I hope to see a better account that this great hero deserves.
