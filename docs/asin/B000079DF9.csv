That it was.Fela has been described as an African Bob Marley, father of Afrobeat music.  More than that, though, he was politically active and a threat to the establishment.  This is what makes him so much more interesting than just a musician.Born in Africa, given a Western educated by Anglicized parents, having lived in America during the Watts riots and greatly influenced by Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, Fela returned to Africa with a new purpose.While his music is what he is mostly known for, his political activity is what is captivating.  The documentary puts his life in a large political context, that of Nigeria during the 70s and early 80s, when this documentary was filmed.  We get to see the inner workings of the Nigerian government through his eyes.  It provides the backdrop for his life at this time.Part musician, part politician, part prophet, Fela is an intriguing character.  Perhaps what is most relevant about this film is how he takes the influence of Westernized ideas - musically and ideologically - and applies them to the problems he returned to in Nigeria.",4,Interesting soul...fascinating historical biopic..,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1189,"['had', 'idea', 'who', 'Fela', 'was', 'documentary', 'junkie', 'just', 'thought', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'been', 'described', 'African', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'father', 'Afrobeat', 'music', 'More', 'though', 'was', 'politically', 'active', 'threat', 'establishment', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'musician.Born', 'Africa', 'given', 'Western', 'educated', 'Anglicized', 'parents', 'having', 'lived', 'America', 'Watts', 'riots', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Fela', 'returned', 'Africa', 'new', 'music', 'what', 'mostly', 'known', 'political', 'activity', 'what', 'captivating', 'documentary', 'life', 'large', 'political', 'context', 'Nigeria', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'when', 'documentary', 'was', 'filmed', 'get', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'Nigerian', 'government', 'eyes', 'backdrop', 'life', 'time.Part', 'musician', 'part', 'politician', 'part', 'prophet', 'Fela', 'intriguing', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'relevant', 'film', 'how', 'influence', 'Westernized', 'ideas', 'musically', 'ideologically', 'problems', 'returned', 'Nigeria']",N/A
725780,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000079DF9,Christopher Culver,"[3, 4]","MUSIC IS THE WEAPON is a 1982 documentary describing the trials and tribulations of Fela Kuti, the Nigerian musician and human rights activist who never stopped calling for an end to corruption in spite of beatings and imprisonment. The context of the film is Fela's hopes for the 1983 presidential election, which subsequently came to naught when the government refused to recognize his candidacy.The documentary covers all the main points of Fela's political life and philosophy. We see him railing against the Nigerian government, calling it worse than that of South Africa because in his country blacks were oppressing blacks. The events of 1977 are recounted, a 15-hour siege when soldiers killed his mother, raped his wives, and arsoned his home. Fela's discusses his ideas of a return to African roots, explains why he has restored a tradition of polygamy to his family, and deplores both capitalism and Marxism as inappropriate for creating a distinctly African society. Fela throughout seems like a man of boundless energy, and the viewer will be amazed at how well he has held up in spite of his many beatings (scars of which are left all over his body). Now, of course, we know that over the next decade he was going to become increasingly seclusive, and ultimately succumb to AIDS, which gives the film a poignant tone.The weakness of the film is that it deals very little with Fela's music itself. I would have liked to see Fela talking about creating the afrobeat genres, his experiences in the US in the late 1960s, and his early work in highlife. There is plenty of footage of performances, but no complete songs, and the audio quality isn't too hot. Plus, the documentary is all in all just 53 minutes long. All in all, it would probably be best to get the documentary as part of theMusic Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kutiset of 2 CDs and a DVD.",3,"Well-organized presentation of Fela's political life, but little about the music itself",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1865,"['MUSIC', 'THE', 'WEAPON', '1982', 'documentary', 'describing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Fela', 'Kuti', 'Nigerian', 'musician', 'human', 'rights', 'activist', 'who', 'never', 'stopped', 'calling', 'end', 'corruption', 'spite', 'beatings', 'imprisonment', 'context', 'film', 'Fela', 'hopes', '1983', 'presidential', 'election', 'subsequently', 'came', 'naught', 'when', 'government', 'refused', 'recognize', 'candidacy.The', 'documentary', 'main', 'points', 'Fela', 'political', 'life', 'philosophy', 'see', 'railing', 'Nigerian', 'government', 'calling', 'worse', 'South', 'Africa', 'country', 'blacks', 'were', 'oppressing', 'blacks', 'events', '1977', 'are', 'recounted', '15-hour', 'siege', 'when', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'mother', 'raped', 'wives', 'arsoned', 'home', 'Fela', 'discusses', 'ideas', 'return', 'African', 'roots', 'why', 'restored', 'tradition', 'polygamy', 'family', 'capitalism', 'Marxism', 'inappropriate', 'creating', 'distinctly', 'African', 'society', 'Fela', 'man', 'boundless', 'energy', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'held', 'up', 'spite', 'many', 'beatings', 'scars', 'are', 'left', 'body', 'Now', 'course', 'know', 'next', 'decade', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'increasingly', 'seclusive', 'ultimately', 'succumb', 'AIDS', 'film', 'poignant', 'tone.The', 'weakness', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'Fela', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Fela', 'talking', 'creating', 'afrobeat', 'genres', 'experiences', 'US', 'late', '1960s', 'early', 'work', 'highlife', 'plenty', 'footage', 'performances', 'complete', 'songs', 'audio', 'quality', ""n't"", 'too', 'hot', 'documentary', 'just', '53', 'minutes', 'long', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'get', 'documentary', 'part', 'theMusic', 'Weapon', 'Best', 'Fela', 'Kutiset', '2', 'CDs', 'DVD']",N/A
