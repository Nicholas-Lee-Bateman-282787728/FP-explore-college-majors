Its obviously not Gone in 60 Seconds, but probably worth a look.""  Oh was I wrong.The acting was BAD from the get go, with actor David Arquette faking his way through the opening scene.  His supporting actors, from the villain of the piece to the Interpol detective, do not a thing to redeem this lemon.Other distractions include the plot, which has holes big enough to drive a truck through.  The sound is atrocious.  At times the dubbed lines don't match the actors' lips.  More often, the background noise, or pitiful soundtrack, drowns out the dialogue.  I was constantly reaching for the remote trying to compensate.  I shouldn't have bothered.Again, I wasn't expecting The Fast & the Furious or Gone in 60 Seconds, just a mindless romp with fast cars and some eye candy.  I had to work far too hard at this one.

Its totally unrealistic.  The premis of the movie is that you have two world class car thieves, a super car that doesn't require gasoline, and two uber-rich and powerful evil guys who don't like each other much.  One wants the super car, the other is well, you'll have to watch to find out.The cars in the movie are beautiful, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Lotus...  That alone is worth the lost cost of the film.  Throw in Femke and well thats a bonus.  Yes the movie is stupid and silly, but its also fun if you approach with the correct mind set.  This is a B class movie so dont expect much.  Given that, enjoy the show.

Watching paint dry is a much better way to spend 90 minutes.Actually I couldn't even make it through the whole thing.  I'm just not that masochistic.  I watched the first half hour and then skipped to the later scenes to see if it would get any better.

554062,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B00004W5UE,Pork Chop,"[0, 1]","RPM is a film that, despite all its flaws, visibly was never intendedfor any other niche audience, than race car voyeurs  and the below 12year old age bracket. Assuming this was RPM's original design, itsuceeded very well in its objective. For all other audiences, despitethe script's promised excitement, it comes up short in entertainmentvalue as a rental or at the theatres.The biggest flaw is the selection of the leading actor, who, despiteall his efforts, easy-going personality, articulate physical andverbal expression, is a poor match for a provokative, photogenic andspontaneous woman like Famke Janssen, sporting an image of a juniorhigh school student.  Arquette is also paired  with the intriguing,young beauty Emmanuelle Seigner,  and somehow this also doesn't seementirely appropriate, although not as much.The leading actor's conduct  seems in line with a 17 year old PeterSellers, with nervous, amateur acting, lacking subtlety, clearlyinexperienced, relying heavily on personal mannerisms, subjectivetic's that professional actors don't intermix, or confuse with oneanother, the personal and the business. Perhaps to cover this up,after 2/3 of the movie is  spent, the Director apparently suggestedto the Arquette to light up a smoke on a regular basis towards thelast 1/3 of the movie, in almost every scene.The script's dialog, seems not to flow naturally, and this sometimesresults in all of  the actors delivering a ""wooden"" performance orinteraction.There is no question, that the filming of over 40 or 50 luxury andrare collection automobiles is fascinating, and innovative for thosewho are not mechanics or visitors of race tracks and museums. Theaction scenes involving these cars, is successfully done, and thoseare the high points of the film.As for the soundtrack, too often sewage-grade ""rock"" music wasselected, meaning instruments apparently were handed to amateurmusicians who had trouble coming up with anything minimallyacceptable. This, when coupled with the leading actor's amateuracting, turns the audience's experience from bad to worse.What  impoverished the film, (aside from the previously mentionedaspects), is the lack in the story's coherence, logic and free flowin terms of following it over 90 mins. Also, the special gizmoallowing the remote control of race cars from 2 km away seems totallyimplausible, and for that reason alone is annoying from the fantasysuch a device exists.The fact that German and French actors were selected, is fine initself, except for the difficulty in natural expression in Englishfor those same actors. The European filming locations actually arewelcomed, however, in the city and countryside action stunt scenesmainly.RPM could have redeemed itself, from the cool cars had there beenhumor, but the audience will find only 1 or 2 genuine moments forlaughs in the entire work, as most of it misses the mark, or isclumsily done.The fact that there is a ""narrative"" from Arquette, speaking over theaction is the final nail in RPM's coffin, considering the actor wasalready a liability.Overall, RPM as a project had significant potential, but the flawsalready mentioned when added to its many ""rough edges"" doesn't meetthe audience's standard, despite a high quality cinematography.",1,"For race car and collectible car  voyeurs, in the youth segment",1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,3255,"['RPM', 'film', 'flaws', 'visibly', 'was', 'never', 'intendedfor', 'other', 'niche', 'audience', 'race', 'car', 'voyeurs', 'below', '12year', 'old', 'age', 'bracket', 'Assuming', 'was', 'RPM', 'original', 'design', 'itsuceeded', 'very', 'well', 'objective', 'other', 'audiences', 'despitethe', 'script', 'promised', 'excitement', 'up', 'short', 'entertainmentvalue', 'rental', 'theatres.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'selection', 'leading', 'actor', 'who', 'despiteall', 'efforts', 'easy-going', 'personality', 'articulate', 'physical', 'andverbal', 'expression', 'poor', 'match', 'provokative', 'photogenic', 'andspontaneous', 'woman', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'sporting', 'image', 'juniorhigh', 'school', 'student', 'Arquette', 'also', 'paired', 'intriguing', 'young', 'beauty', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'somehow', 'also', ""n't"", 'seementirely', 'appropriate', 'not', 'much.The', 'leading', 'actor', 'conduct', 'line', '17', 'year', 'old', 'PeterSellers', 'nervous', 'amateur', 'acting', 'lacking', 'subtlety', 'clearlyinexperienced', 'relying', 'heavily', 'personal', 'mannerisms', 'subjectivetic', 'professional', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'intermix', 'confuse', 'oneanother', 'personal', 'business', 'Perhaps', 'cover', 'up', '2/3', 'movie', 'spent', 'Director', 'apparently', 'suggestedto', 'Arquette', 'light', 'up', 'smoke', 'regular', 'basis', 'towards', 'thelast', '1/3', 'movie', 'almost', 'scene.The', 'script', 'dialog', 'not', 'flow', 'naturally', 'sometimesresults', 'actors', 'delivering', 'wooden', 'performance', 'question', 'filming', '40', '50', 'luxury', 'andrare', 'collection', 'automobiles', 'fascinating', 'innovative', 'thosewho', 'are', 'not', 'mechanics', 'visitors', 'race', 'tracks', 'museums', 'Theaction', 'involving', 'cars', 'successfully', 'done', 'thoseare', 'high', 'points', 'film.As', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'often', 'sewage-grade', 'rock', 'music', 'wasselected', 'meaning', 'instruments', 'apparently', 'were', 'handed', 'amateurmusicians', 'who', 'had', 'trouble', 'coming', 'up', 'anything', 'minimallyacceptable', 'when', 'coupled', 'leading', 'actor', 'amateuracting', 'audience', 'experience', 'bad', 'worse.What', 'impoverished', 'film', 'aside', 'previously', 'mentionedaspects', 'lack', 'story', 'coherence', 'logic', 'free', 'flowin', 'terms', 'following', '90', 'mins', 'Also', 'special', 'gizmoallowing', 'remote', 'control', 'race', 'cars', '2', 'km', 'away', 'totallyimplausible', 'reason', 'alone', 'annoying', 'fantasysuch', 'device', 'exists.The', 'fact', 'German', 'French', 'actors', 'were', 'selected', 'fine', 'initself', 'difficulty', 'natural', 'expression', 'Englishfor', 'same', 'actors', 'European', 'filming', 'locations', 'actually', 'arewelcomed', 'however', 'city', 'countryside', 'action', 'stunt', 'scenesmainly.RPM', 'could', 'have', 'redeemed', 'cool', 'cars', 'had', 'beenhumor', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'only', '1', '2', 'genuine', 'moments', 'forlaughs', 'entire', 'work', 'most', 'mark', 'isclumsily', 'done.The', 'fact', 'narrative', 'Arquette', 'speaking', 'theaction', 'final', 'nail', 'RPM', 'coffin', 'considering', 'actor', 'wasalready', 'liability.Overall', 'RPM', 'project', 'had', 'significant', 'potential', 'flawsalready', 'mentioned', 'when', 'added', 'many', 'rough', 'edges', ""n't"", 'meetthe', 'audience', 'standard', 'high', 'quality', 'cinematography']",N/A
554063,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B00004W5UE,S Martin,"[3, 5]","There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start. I think it was Fox's way of capitalizing on the rush of car movies in the last few years.My biggest problem is the plot. There are holes and side plots that really make no sense. Luke is a lot like Ferris Bueller, he gets in trouble and causes problems. His biggest problem is he's addicted to stealing classic cars, sometimes from right under their owner's noses. When his most recent escapade lands him in trouble with the law he jets off to Europe until it all blows over.In addition to Luke's escapades as a classic car thief, and his rivalry with Claudia, who turns out is his sister, there's a side plot involving a woman from the states trying to arrest Luke, and an Italian detective who'd rather hop into the sack with her than help her solve the case. These two are thrown into the plot at random times, almost as comic relief, but it's not funny, and really has very little to do with the movie.The plot gets even more complicated when you throw in a pretty girl for Luke to fall for, who just so happens to be tied into a ring of car thieves who want the RPM, a revolutionary prototype car. They offer Luke lots of money to steal it, and then up the odds by threatening the pretty girl he's gotten himself attached to. The pretty girl seems almost as an afterthought, they would have done better to offer Luke a way out of his problem in the US, it would have made him just as likely to steal the car.The whole movie is almost like a train wreck. Not only does the plot jump around and take weird side turns when you least expect it, but the dialog is poor, and the characters seem built on stereotypes and have no personalities of their own. Building interesting, complex characters would have been lost on the script though, it too is built on stereotypes and already well used plot devices.The only saving grace of the movie was the nice cars. There are a lot of nice classic cars in the movie, and you can momentarily lose yourself in their grace and looks before you're pulled back to realize that the plot stinks, the premise isn't very interesting, and overall it's just a very bad movie.
