And what's worse is that theres 2 films that are 1/2 the length of the standard one, all about forgiveness. 1/2 an hour of ""I'll forgive you."" It's a very good message, but it's boring. As for the silly song, well it doesn't have Larry, it's about a commercialized Forgive-a-matic, which you press a button to forgive you sins. But all you need to do is ask God, a charectar says. WE UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. We couldn't agree with Phil Vischier more that this is an excellent moral, but he pounds it into our heads. Every second of the show, minus the main titles is about forgiveness, but it's so much I forgive you that children might get bored. Maybe this film HAD to be made. It's is a good moral, but a very boring tape.

They do 2 segments instead of one larger segment.  In  between there is no song, but the Forgive-o-matic section is still good.  It's just no Silly Song.This is a very good lesson for kids.  When  someone asks for forgiveness, give it to them.  I would note only one  thing.  A person who is truly sorry will do more than say he or she is  sorry.  That isn't mentioned in the video, but I also think it is an  oversight.  However, I have to keep in mind that it is geared towards kids.  Big Idea is trying to get the general message across, which they do very  well.  The parents need to be around to make sure the message in their head  doesn't become one of cheap grace.  We don't want our kids coming up to us  asking forgiveness when all they really want is to get out of trouble and  they genuinely aren't sorry.  But, as I said, this is more of a note than a  critique.

I imagine this is because the authors were still new at making movies.  The first half of the video, about the grapes of wrath, has no plot whatsoever and is merely a lesson.  It is not  presented in a very interesting way.  The second half, the gilligan's  island parody, was much more amusing and presented better music and a great  message in a fun way.  It still wasn't as good as the others, but it was  decent.  The Forgive-o-matic sequence really made me happy.  I loved that  part a lot.

Many Catholics, including myself, feel that this is actually intended as a slight against the Sacrament of Reconciliation [Confession].  It is a mis-interpretation of the meaning of the Sacrament, and could be confusing to young Catholics.

The music is excellent as always, but the writing just doesn't measure up. Both segments are preachy and not very funny, with awkward comedic timing and pat, contrived dialogue and situations. With the ""Gilligan's Island"" spoof they overreached themselved, as they just didn't have the computer power available to them to satisfactorily render some of the effects they were going for. Roman Catholic and Orthodox parents will probably object to the gratuitous shot at the sacrament of Confession that occupies the space between the two segments. It's almost worth seeing for the introduction of Pa Grape, but since his personality undergoes a complete transformation in later videos you don't lose much by not seeing him here.
