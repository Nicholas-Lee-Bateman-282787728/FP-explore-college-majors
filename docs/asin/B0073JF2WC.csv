I didn't want to watch yet another raunchy take on a romantic comedy, but I figured neither one of these two actors would get involved in a raunchy movie unless it had something redeeming about it.I was delighted to see, as the movie progressed, that their is really nothing particularly suggestive or sexual in the film that isn't shown in the trailer. This may disappoint some, but I liked the movie as it was.It is an exploration of this marriage that has went stale and how the couple tries to revive it through desperate means. It ends up being more serious than funny though it does have its funny moments.My only nitpick is Mandy Moore. I like her in movies when she isn't supposed to be in  love. I don't really buy her as a romantic actress...I actually think she is more adept in her mean girl parts like The Princess Diaries, Saved, American Dreamz, etc. However, she wasn't enough of a downer to ruin this movie. I ended up kind of liking it...the little outtakes or deleted scenes in the end credits were kind of cute, so keep an eye out for them.",4,It Isn't Raunchy,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1251,"['saw', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'thinking', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'even', 'love', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'manage', 'star', 'duds', 'time', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'yet', 'raunchy', 'take', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'figured', 'one', 'two', 'actors', 'would', 'get', 'involved', 'raunchy', 'movie', 'had', 'something', 'redeeming', 'it.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'movie', 'progressed', 'really', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'suggestive', 'sexual', 'film', ""n't"", 'shown', 'trailer', 'may', 'disappoint', 'liked', 'movie', 'exploration', 'marriage', 'went', 'stale', 'how', 'couple', 'revive', 'desperate', 'means', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'serious', 'funny', 'have', 'funny', 'moments.My', 'only', 'nitpick', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'movies', 'when', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'romantic', 'actress', 'actually', 'think', 'more', 'adept', 'mean', 'girl', 'parts', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'Saved', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'etc', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'downer', 'ruin', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'kind', 'liking', 'little', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'kind', 'cute', 'so', 'keep', 'eye', 'out']",Swinging With The Finkels
1525212,A3VZCJWM4E8EEN,B0073JF2WC,Ava M.,"[3, 3]","The Finkels are in a rut. They've been married 9 years and can't seem to find the desire or passion to please one another anymore. Somewhat conservative Ellie comes up with the idea of swinging, to see if the grass is greener on the other side, so Alvin goes along with it. What happens after are hilarious insights on the low points of marriage that are funny only because they're true. The side characters are equally as entertaining, mimicking someone we either know or have known. Many thoughts are thoughts we've all expressed at one point, some issues are serious, others are mundane. Either way, living vicariously through the Finkels should make you think of your own relationship. The ending was predictable but it was okay because the movie itself was hilarious, quirky, insightful and definitely off the beaten path. I was so surprised by Mandy Moore! I've never really liked much of her work, but thought she played this character wonderfully, she was completely endearing in her role, and Martin Freeman was hilarious as well. Totally don't see this couple together in real life, but they were equally strong in their characters enough to get pass that. This is not a main stream comedy, its a dry, very witty and satisfying movie, and many laugh out loud moments. It's not slapstick, or crude, believe it or not and this won't leave you with a bad, uncomfortable feeling at the end (like, for instanceThe Break-Up], it's actually a very sweet comedy.I was very surprised and very pleased.",5,Living Vicariously!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1502,"['Finkels', 'are', 'rut', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', '9', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'desire', 'passion', 'please', 'one', 'anymore', 'Somewhat', 'conservative', 'Ellie', 'up', 'idea', 'swinging', 'see', 'grass', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'so', 'Alvin', 'along', 'What', 'are', 'hilarious', 'insights', 'low', 'points', 'marriage', 'are', 'funny', 'only', ""'re"", 'true', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'mimicking', 'someone', 'either', 'know', 'have', 'known', 'Many', 'thoughts', 'are', 'thoughts', ""'ve"", 'expressed', 'one', 'point', 'issues', 'are', 'serious', 'others', 'are', 'mundane', 'way', 'living', 'vicariously', 'Finkels', 'should', 'make', 'think', 'own', 'relationship', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'was', 'okay', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'quirky', 'insightful', 'definitely', 'beaten', 'path', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'Mandy', 'Moore', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'much', 'work', 'thought', 'played', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'was', 'completely', 'endearing', 'role', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'was', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'Totally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'couple', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'equally', 'strong', 'characters', 'enough', 'get', 'pass', 'not', 'main', 'stream', 'comedy', 'dry', 'very', 'witty', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'many', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'not', 'slapstick', 'crude', 'believe', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'bad', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'end', 'instanceThe', 'Break-Up', ']', 'actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'comedy.I', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'very', 'pleased']",Swinging With The Finkels
1525213,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0073JF2WC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Swinging With the Finkels is filled with the usual stereotypes and inaccuracies pertaining to married people who seek relationships with other couples, and turned into Hollywood's overblown and far-fetched version of such an idea.  Of course, usually these couples are only pretending or suggesting, but sometimes they really go through with it.  A man and woman decide that since their relationship is really stale and uninteresting, that they should date other people while still remaining a couple.  They lay some rules down so neither one has *too* much fun with their new partner.The problem?  The storyline -while certainly promising if the movie had better writing- was a huge letdown for me.  Almost nothing of interest happens.  Too much static and generic sitcom-like storytelling that doesn't offer anything in the way of compelling must-see entertainment.The only segment that's truly honestly funny is the one where the wife (played by Mandy Moore) has a little private adventure with a cucumber after receiving some friendly advice by her friends on how to spice up her sex life since the husband isn't getting the job done.  Of course you and I both know what's going to happen- she turns the music up really loud in her bedroom and thinks she's alone but, of course, she's not.  She's then caught in the act by not only her husband, but her parents which results in a few funny lines admittedly (such as the whole family going to a restaurant the next morning and the father asking if she'd like a cucumber, lol).Martin Freeman has a few lines that are worth noting, such as when he embarrassingly knows Richard Simmons a little too well, and when he takes his friend to a doctor and his friend mentions being a dentist and inappropriately mentions to the doctor how he can remove the stains off her teeth.  Who'd say such a thing?These are decent lines, but overall, even though the film barely reaches 80 minutes, it's probably the longest 80 minutes of my life.  Too much relationship-type nonsense that doesn't even come close to being original, much less funny.  Seriously, in this day and age, better writers should be brought in for these type of movies because the whole marriage/cheating concept written from a comical point of view is unbelievably stale by this point.
