It's French, it has attractive stars, there's plenty of nudity and sex and it is supposedly a sensitive view of real life.  It's the kind of thing I usually love and I'm not sure why I didn't like this much. Probably because I had no sympathy for the female lead character.  She seems to be a child of a broken home who has a constant chip on her shoulder.  She complains about her mother, and hates her father, has an uncomfortable pregnancy, a miserable birth, and an exhausting time with the baby.  She also hates her mother-in-law and soon begins to hate her husband. Her faculty adviser dumps her. The baby cries all the time---who can blame it?  The photography is pleasant and there is a lot of soft, tinkly music to signal when something touching is happening. I didn't make it through to the end.By the way this can't be called a romantic comedy.  There is absolutely nothing funny about it.",2,"Love, sex. baby, problems",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,940,"['people', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'lot', 'French', 'attractive', 'stars', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'sex', 'supposedly', 'sensitive', 'view', 'real', 'life', 'kind', 'thing', 'usually', 'love', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'Probably', 'had', 'sympathy', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'be', 'child', 'broken', 'home', 'who', 'constant', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'mother', 'father', 'uncomfortable', 'pregnancy', 'miserable', 'birth', 'exhausting', 'time', 'baby', 'also', 'mother-in-law', 'soon', 'begins', 'hate', 'husband', 'faculty', 'adviser', 'baby', 'time', 'can', 'blame', 'photography', 'pleasant', 'lot', 'soft', 'tinkly', 'music', 'signal', 'when', 'something', 'touching', 'happening', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'end.By', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'called', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'funny']",N/A

The baby is healthy. The mother insists on breast feeding and spend 100% attention on her baby. That's the problem. It's not a comedy. It tells you the real life of a woman getting PHD degree and having a baby at the same time.Woman went through the bay delivery process and felt she loss the interest of becoming a woman again. Especially when a group of medical students watched her private part and the professor(her husband's uncle) explained how well he repairs her body part. Even one of the student took photo.,4,Don't watch.,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,635,"['are', 'ready', 'have', 'children', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'having', 'baby', 'baby', 'healthy', 'mother', 'breast', 'feeding', 'spend', '100', '%', 'attention', 'baby', 'problem', 'not', 'comedy', 'real', 'life', 'woman', 'getting', 'PHD', 'degree', 'having', 'baby', 'same', 'time.Woman', 'went', 'bay', 'delivery', 'process', 'felt', 'loss', 'interest', 'becoming', 'woman', 'again', 'Especially', 'when', 'group', 'medical', 'students', 'watched', 'private', 'part', 'professor', 'husband', 'uncle', 'explained', 'how', 'well', 'body', 'part', 'Even', 'one', 'student', 'took', 'photo']",N/A

They start seeing each other and he has the idea of them having a baby. She agrees, even though she apparently has NO job and he is a clerk in a video store. Neither one of them thought this through. She becomes pregnant.Then comes the story of her pregnancy, hormones, etc. She doesn't want to attend her natural childbirth classes and the midwife (?) and her boyfriend (he never attended either) lay guilt trips on her when she is in labor. She gives birth to a huge, rather unattractive baby girl (the hugeness causes her a lot of physical problems).  As far as I could tell she and the boyfriend never got married, but the subtitles say he is her husband. Boyfriend gets a better job (doesn't say what) and wears a suit, but remains flaky and unaware. She stays home all day with baby and is depressed. She says she has hardly left the house in a year! I never really saw any great attraction or compatibility between this couple, so it's not very interesting. Mother-in-law (?) is weird and says she breastfed son until he was five. She gives the daughter-in-law a huge metal/mechanical breast pump.Overall, depressing, boring, and doesn't have much to say.",2,A Dumb Event,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1322,"['Young', 'woman', 'attending', 'graduate', 'school', 'mother', 'states', 'least', 'twice', 'SHE', 'had', 'insisted', 'daughter', 'go', 'videos', 'attracted', 'clerk', 'start', 'seeing', 'other', 'idea', 'having', 'baby', 'even', 'apparently', 'NO', 'job', 'clerk', 'video', 'store', 'one', 'thought', 'pregnant.Then', 'story', 'pregnancy', 'hormones', 'etc', ""n't"", 'want', 'attend', 'natural', 'childbirth', 'classes', 'midwife', 'boyfriend', 'never', 'attended', 'lay', 'guilt', 'trips', 'when', 'labor', 'birth', 'huge', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'baby', 'girl', 'hugeness', 'lot', 'physical', 'problems', 'As', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'boyfriend', 'never', 'got', 'married', 'subtitles', 'say', 'husband', 'Boyfriend', 'better', 'job', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'suit', 'flaky', 'unaware', 'home', 'day', 'baby', 'depressed', 'hardly', 'left', 'house', 'year', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'great', 'attraction', 'compatibility', 'couple', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'Mother-in-law', 'weird', 'breastfed', 'son', 'was', 'five', 'daughter-in-law', 'huge', 'metal/mechanical', 'breast', 'pump.Overall', 'depressing', 'boring', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say']",N/A
1549359,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B008B089OA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""A Happy Event"" (""Un heureux &eacute;v&eacute;nement"") is a French romantic comedy with a difference. The story centers on a young couple, Barbara (Louise Bourgoin, ""Les aventures extraordinaires d'Ad&egrave;le Blanc-Sec""), a graduate student of philosophy, and Nicola (Pio Marma), a movie director wannabe working at a rental DVD shop. They fall in love with each other (with a lot of references to famous movies), and start living together. Then Barbara becomes pregnant.Based on a book written by Eliette Abecassis, ""A Happy Event"" deals with maternity or motherhood, topic that is rarely considered as a central theme of a romantic comedy. It works, and the fast-paced film is notable for its detailed descriptions of what happens to a woman when she has a baby, which are often realistic and expressed with light-hearted touch. The film (ironically titled, of course) is not all about ""happy events,"" but even the more serious moments are offset by sense of humor that arrives in the most unexpected fashion.But what makes the film special is the chemistry between the stars Louise Bourgoin and Pio Marma. Though most supporting characters are stock types (with an exception of Barbara's mother Claire played by Josiane Balasko, whose complicated relationship with her daughter is one of the film's best assets), the young couple Barbara and Nicola are credible and likable. The second half of the film is a bit weak, covering more familiar territories, but ""A Happy Event"" is funny, honest (including some nudities) and often insightful.",4,(3.5 STARS) French Romantic Comedy with a Difference,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,1543,"['Happy', 'Event', 'Un', 'heureux', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'nement', 'French', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'difference', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'couple', 'Barbara', 'Louise', 'Bourgoin', 'Les', ""d'Ad"", 'egrave', 'Blanc-Sec', 'graduate', 'student', 'philosophy', 'Nicola', 'Pio', 'Marma', 'movie', 'director', 'wannabe', 'working', 'rental', 'DVD', 'shop', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'lot', 'references', 'famous', 'movies', 'start', 'living', 'together', 'Then', 'Barbara', 'becomes', 'pregnant.Based', 'book', 'written', 'Eliette', 'Abecassis', 'Happy', 'Event', 'deals', 'maternity', 'motherhood', 'topic', 'rarely', 'considered', 'central', 'theme', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'notable', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'what', 'woman', 'when', 'baby', 'are', 'often', 'realistic', 'expressed', 'light-hearted', 'touch', 'film', 'ironically', 'titled', 'course', 'not', 'happy', 'events', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'moments', 'are', 'offset', 'sense', 'humor', 'most', 'unexpected', 'fashion.But', 'what', 'film', 'special', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'Louise', 'Bourgoin', 'Pio', 'Marma', 'most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'stock', 'types', 'exception', 'Barbara', 'mother', 'Claire', 'played', 'Josiane', 'Balasko', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'assets', 'young', 'couple', 'Barbara', 'Nicola', 'are', 'credible', 'likable', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'weak', 'covering', 'more', 'familiar', 'territories', 'Happy', 'Event', 'funny', 'honest', 'including', 'nudities', 'often', 'insightful']",N/A
