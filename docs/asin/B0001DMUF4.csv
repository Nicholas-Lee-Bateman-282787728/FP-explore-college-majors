801115,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0001DMUF4,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[25, 26]","Although I enjoyed reading all of Margery Allingham's Albert Campion series, I wasn't sure if I'd like the film series.  Sometimes the characters and ambience that are in your mind as you read are so different from those presented by putting them into three dimensional reality.  I needn't have hesitated, however, since Peter Davidson's Campion and Brian Glover's Lugg are just as I imagined them.  While the latter would be a fairly simple character to enact, the former is by no means easily captured.  The Campion in the stories is a complex character, slightly foppish and light hearted, like Lord Peter Whimsey, yet no ones fool.  Davidson gives the character just the right blend of wittiness, intellect, and affability.Each of the stories in the collection are a treat for anyone interested in period settings, and the 1920s and 1930s are among the more enjoyable.  The architecture, furniture, automobiles, clothing, make-up, and hairstyles encapsulate the era beautifully.  The mysteries themselves are quite clever and entertaining.  A lovely visit to a pleasant time and place and interesting people.Of this foursome I enjoyed Flowers for the Judge, about a murder in a publishing house, the most enjoyable, with Sweet Danger the dearest of the set.  Dancers in Mourning seemed to wander a little like it was having trouble finding its solution, and Mystery Mile seemed a little too contrived and melodramatic.  Still all four are worth watching more than once just to spend time with the characters.",4,A lovely place to visit.,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1512,"['enjoyed', 'reading', 'Margery', 'Allingham', 'Albert', 'Campion', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'series', 'characters', 'ambience', 'are', 'mind', 'read', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'presented', 'putting', 'three', 'dimensional', 'reality', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'hesitated', 'however', 'Peter', 'Davidson', 'Campion', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'Lugg', 'are', 'just', 'imagined', 'latter', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'simple', 'character', 'enact', 'former', 'means', 'easily', 'captured', 'Campion', 'stories', 'complex', 'character', 'slightly', 'foppish', 'light', 'hearted', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Whimsey', 'yet', 'ones', 'fool', 'Davidson', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'wittiness', 'intellect', 'affability.Each', 'stories', 'collection', 'are', 'treat', 'anyone', 'interested', 'period', 'settings', '1920s', '1930s', 'are', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'architecture', 'furniture', 'automobiles', 'clothing', 'make-up', 'hairstyles', 'encapsulate', 'era', 'beautifully', 'mysteries', 'are', 'quite', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'lovely', 'visit', 'pleasant', 'time', 'place', 'interesting', 'people.Of', 'foursome', 'enjoyed', 'Flowers', 'Judge', 'murder', 'publishing', 'house', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Sweet', 'Danger', 'dearest', 'set', 'Dancers', 'Mourning', 'seemed', 'wander', 'little', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'finding', 'solution', 'Mystery', 'Mile', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'melodramatic', 'Still', 'four', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'just', 'spend', 'time', 'characters']",Campion - The Complete Second Season

801117,A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L,B0001DMUF4,babydoh,"[31, 31]","The second series of Campion is every bit as wonderful as the first.  Why, oh why were there only two?! Ah, well.  We have eight amazing episodes to watch over and over on DVD (sixteen, I suppose, if you count each half as an episode), and there are certainly worse things.  I should start off by mentioning that the order in which they've advertised the stories on the side of the box is WRONG.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  As they were originally presented in 1990, ""Dancers In Mourning"" was the first, followed by ""Flowers for the Judge,"" ""Mystery Mile,"" and THEN ""Sweet Danger"".  Do NOT watch ""Sweet Danger"" first -- it must be saved till last.  Trust me!Now, on to the episodes themselves: ""Dancers In Mourning"" is my personal favorite of the four, tied in my book with the first season's finale, ""Death of a Ghost"".  It (Dancers In Mourning) deals with a series of murders that occur within a group of actors performing in a musical, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.  And there is a sort-of-romance for Campion on the side, to boot! This one is not to be missed.The sophomore episode, ""Flowers for the Judge,"" is the story of a murder that occurs at a publishing company.  Although parts of the story seem just a tad contrived (and here I am referring solely to the jury process in the court scene - horrific!), it's a good story.  Plus it has a terrific ending.Number three, ""Mystery Mile"" (the name of a seaside town, as it turns out) is another captivating tale.  Its plot is complex and I hesitate to give too much away anyway, so I'll leave it ambiguous and intriguing by saying merely that it involves a magician; quicksand; visiting ""Americans"" (read: good British actors employing atrocious accents and almost managing to make themselves look bad, and one of whom incidentally is a doppelganger for Topher Grace).  And, best of all, there is Campion in a sailor hat.  (*Homer Simpson-esque gurgling noise*)Finally, there is ""Sweet Danger.""  ""Sweet Danger,"" which leaves so much to be desired -- not because the episode is bad, quite the opposite; but because it breaks off Campion's story just where you MUST KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT!!!  (Footnote for those who have seen it: I was later informed that the character of Amanda Fitton was supposed to be a teenager.  Who knew?)And last but not least, I feel it is my duty to review Peter Davison.  Ahh, Peter Davison...what can one say? He manages somehow to be even lovelier and more charming than in the first season, and this is no mean feat.  This man has the funniest, sweetest smile on earth.

The first season was a little lofty and whimsical. This season draws you into intense intrigue and action from the start. The first movie finds Campion allying himself with a couple chums to ferret out a great mystery. They must determine why a wealthy gangster is trying so hard to grab up items that will prove the heritage of an heir to a small but mineral rich kingdom in Europe. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole episode fearing the worst for his new found romantic/intellectual interest.The second movie finds Campion investigating two murders at the theater.  Campion must investigate an interesting group of performers that make you suspicious of them in one way or another. The third movie has him investigating how a man was murdered and locked into a strongroom at a publishers vault. The coroner's findings shed some light on the case, but make it difficult not to jump to conclusions. The fourth movie is mystifying and interesting and we are given puzzles like a maze leading to a missing person, quicksand that is not forgiving, and a frightening revelation when one of the ladies is kidnapped. The criminal behind it is cunning and Campion must keep his wits. This was a very exciting episode and I enjoyed it and the first one in the set the most.Great production values as usual with the same high quality standard for detail in the sets and costumes. All in all a excellent addition to your DVD collection. A must have for any that bought the first season. After seeing this set I only wish they had made more seasons of this wonderful series.

The name Campion is taken from a small white field flower that he sometimes wore in his buttonhole.Unfortunately, this and other bits of trivia are missing from these DVDs, because the BBC videos are missing `Mystery Theater' hostess Diana Rigg who introduced the stories to PBS viewers and related additional information about the background of the protagonist and his sidekick valet-sometimes house maid, the former house breaker and very talented Mr. Lugg.The second season includes episodes that feature: 1/ the royal claims of the Pontsbright family to a newly formed country in the Balkans also of interest to the Nazis; 2/ Evil happenings involving dancers and death;  3/ Murder at a publishing house; 4/ Mobsters and Turkish smugglers.Like Christie, Allingham excelled in the creation of plots and her characterization of Campion (played by Peter Davison -- `All Creatures Great and Small' and ""At Home With the Braithwaites) and Lugg are well done.

The emphasis is on the light touch, the humorous approach, with which the this English Gentleman Detective unravels the puzzles coming his way. The length falls between the lengthy multiple episodes granted Carmichael's early Lord Peter and the single hour allotted many of the later BBC series. This 2 episode format gives sufficient time to build up some of the supporting roles but not enough for the leisurely pace of the much more expensive multi-episode productions. The compromise a very popular show like Poirot was able to achieve, with both single episode and movie length treatments, apparently was not available for this two season relative failure. At any rate we have Peter Davison doing a distinctive and delightful Campion, with his man, Lugg, played by Brian Glover, equally fulfilling, as his ex-hooligan man-servant and accomplice in crime-solving. Each episode offers a historical setting, early and mid-thirties in this volume, with scenic design up to the standard expected from BBC. Similarly, supporting players are always accomplished although occasionally the role calls for a period foppishness which might seem weak to current eyes. I find both this and the previous, Set One, quite entertaining, with all the class of such outstanding TV as we were given in Morse, Poirot, Miss Marple, Sherlock Holmes, and the other top BBC offerings. Both sets are highly recommended for the classic detective story fan and for most general viewers, other than those who need bang-bang action, sexually charged, fare (which do have their place-but never in this particular sub-genre).",5,Fine Adaptations of A Queen of Mystery,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,1706,"['Watching', 'second', 'series', 'Campion', 'again', 'gave', 'even', 'more', 'pleasure', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'ago', 'emphasis', 'light', 'touch', 'humorous', 'approach', 'English', 'Gentleman', 'Detective', 'puzzles', 'coming', 'way', 'length', 'lengthy', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'granted', 'Carmichael', 'early', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'single', 'hour', 'allotted', 'many', 'later', 'BBC', 'series', '2', 'episode', 'format', 'sufficient', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'supporting', 'roles', 'not', 'enough', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', 'multi-episode', 'productions', 'compromise', 'very', 'popular', 'show', 'Poirot', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'single', 'episode', 'movie', 'length', 'treatments', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'two', 'season', 'relative', 'failure', 'rate', 'have', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'doing', 'distinctive', 'delightful', 'Campion', 'man', 'Lugg', 'played', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'equally', 'fulfilling', 'ex-hooligan', 'man-servant', 'accomplice', 'crime-solving', 'episode', 'historical', 'setting', 'early', 'mid-thirties', 'volume', 'scenic', 'design', 'up', 'standard', 'expected', 'BBC', 'Similarly', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'always', 'accomplished', 'occasionally', 'role', 'period', 'foppishness', 'might', 'seem', 'weak', 'current', 'eyes', 'find', 'previous', 'Set', 'One', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'class', 'such', 'outstanding', 'TV', 'were', 'given', 'Morse', 'Poirot', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'other', 'top', 'BBC', 'offerings', 'sets', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'classic', 'detective', 'story', 'fan', 'most', 'general', 'viewers', 'other', 'who', 'need', 'bang-bang', 'action', 'sexually', 'charged', 'fare', 'do', 'have', 'place-but', 'never', 'particular', 'sub-genre']",Campion - The Complete Second Season

Yes, Peter Davison is just as superb as ever, in his role as the mischievous and charming Campion, as is Brian Glover, his wry and unusual manservant Lugg, but I think my main complaint is that the focus of this season is on action, and not so much characterization.  Campion is still very much an enigma, and I was looking forward to getting to know him better, but that didn't really happen.  I think this series would have definitely benefitted from another season more in line with the first one - with an emphasis on character, especially to include Amanda Fitton, who was enticingly introduced to us only to leave us in the lurch.  Those who have read the books know that Campion will marry her eventually, but it would have been lovely to see that play out!My other major complaint is that in two of the episodes - Dancers in Mourning and Flowers for the Judge - have been filmed in such a way that half the time the actors heads are cut off, and all we see are their mouths moving at the very top of the screen!  I was relieved that Mystery Mile and Sweet Danger (definitely my favorite episodes of this season) do not share this defect.This series is still very good.  Even a disappointing Campion is better than much of what passes for ""mystery"" nowadays.
