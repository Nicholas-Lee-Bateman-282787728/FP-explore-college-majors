I am happy to report that the quality of vision and audio is perfect and very typical of the good old three strip Technicolor. Although this was an MGM release, Warner have been reponsible for this great transfer, so those that have a video projector and a 10ft screen, can see it as I saw it presented in the movie houses in 1951. Thanks Amazon, MGM and Warner, I was happy to part with my cash for this one.Brian MuhlingWestern Australia",5,EXCUSE MY DUST,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,548,"['only', 'concern', 'when', 'purchasing', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'How', 'picture', 'quality', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'quality', 'vision', 'audio', 'perfect', 'very', 'typical', 'good', 'old', 'three', 'strip', 'Technicolor', 'was', 'MGM', 'release', 'Warner', 'have', 'been', 'reponsible', 'great', 'transfer', 'so', 'have', 'video', 'projector', '10ft', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'saw', 'presented', 'movie', 'houses', '1951', 'Thanks', 'Amazon', 'MGM', 'Warner', 'was', 'happy', 'part', 'cash', 'one.Brian', 'MuhlingWestern', 'Australia']",N/A

1377251,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B003Z9T0W2,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","This colorful MGM production is a delightful story of an 1890's inventor (Red, of course) whose inventions tend not to work out very well. That is, until he creates the ""Gas-O-mobile"" which runs on a newfangled cleaner called gasoline. His gal supports him, but this notion of ""horseless carriages"" puts Red in direct opposition with her father, who does everything possible to veto the idea.It's not exactly pure Skelton (there's nearly half a dozen songs in 20 minutes), and Red is a bit more restrained here than in, say, other comedies such as ""A Southern Yankee"" or ""The Fuller Brush Man"". But this doesn't make the film any less entertaining. There are moments to savor, such as Red accidentally setting his barn on fire with the new invention, and a dandy climactic road race between Red, his chief rival, and some other motorists.A very pleasant Skelton romp worthy of adding to the collection!",5,"A breezy, likable Skelton ""vehicle""",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,902,"['colorful', 'MGM', 'production', 'delightful', 'story', '1890', 'inventor', 'Red', 'course', 'inventions', 'tend', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Gas-O-mobile', 'newfangled', 'cleaner', 'called', 'gasoline', 'gal', 'supports', 'notion', 'horseless', 'carriages', 'puts', 'Red', 'direct', 'opposition', 'father', 'who', 'everything', 'possible', 'veto', 'idea.It', 'not', 'exactly', 'pure', 'Skelton', 'nearly', 'dozen', 'songs', '20', 'minutes', 'Red', 'bit', 'more', 'restrained', 'here', 'say', 'other', 'comedies', 'such', 'A', 'Southern', 'Yankee', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Man', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'less', 'entertaining', 'are', 'moments', 'savor', 'such', 'Red', 'accidentally', 'setting', 'barn', 'fire', 'new', 'invention', 'dandy', 'climactic', 'road', 'race', 'Red', 'chief', 'rival', 'other', 'motorists.A', 'very', 'pleasant', 'Skelton', 'romp', 'worthy', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A

Lynch ""vtl""","[4, 4]","If you're expecting a Red Skelton comedy romp, you'll be disappointed, because this a PLEASANT MGM musical comedy set at the time of the advent of horseless buggies.  Red has some nice comedy turns, but this is no ""Yellow Cab Man"" or ""Fuller Brush Man"".  However, Red comes across well as the bungling inventor and leading man...and playing the male love interest to Sally Forrest's female lead.  The color is mostly quite beautiful, although the mountains off in the distance made me laugh since the setting is supposed to be Red's home state of Indiana.  The print is excellent, with a few seconds here and there where the color seems to fluctuate, but you may not notice it at all. In 1951, if you wanted the wacky Red Skelton you could find him on the small tube, while on the big MGM screen, he was still a musical comedy star that was a bit sedated...perhaps showing his range as a performer.  You'll like this film...you just won't be laughing out loud.",3,A musical comedy...not a Skelton romp,1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,960,"[""'re"", 'expecting', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'comedy', 'romp', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'PLEASANT', 'MGM', 'musical', 'comedy', 'set', 'time', 'advent', 'horseless', 'buggies', 'Red', 'nice', 'comedy', 'turns', 'Yellow', 'Cab', 'Man', 'Fuller', 'Brush', 'Man', 'However', 'Red', 'across', 'well', 'bungling', 'inventor', 'leading', 'man', 'playing', 'male', 'love', 'interest', 'Sally', 'Forrest', 'female', 'lead', 'color', 'mostly', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'mountains', 'off', 'distance', 'made', 'setting', 'supposed', 'be', 'Red', 'home', 'state', 'Indiana', 'print', 'excellent', 'few', 'seconds', 'here', 'there', 'where', 'color', 'fluctuate', 'may', 'not', 'notice', '1951', 'wanted', 'wacky', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'could', 'find', 'small', 'tube', 'big', 'MGM', 'screen', 'was', 'still', 'musical', 'comedy', 'star', 'was', 'bit', 'sedated', 'perhaps', 'showing', 'range', 'performer', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud']",N/A
