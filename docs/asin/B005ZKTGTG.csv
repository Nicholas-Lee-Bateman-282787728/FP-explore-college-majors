And, I use the word &#34;sparse&#34; in a positive sense. The viewer is  invited to draw conclusions, make jumps in plot lines,assumptions of motivations&#8230;.essentially, become part of the movie. And, isn't that always what draws viewers in?It's a lovely, thoughtful movie chronically the difficult paradigm of a daughter, mother and  a fantasy. The main characters are finely drawn & cast, and even the secondary characters are memorable.Don't be put off by the Country /Western implications of an association with Dolly Parton. Her involvement is graciously minimal, and, yet essential to the story line. It is well worth your time, and will reverberate long after the movie is over.",5,"Great ""Coming of Age"" movie",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,847,"['viewing', 'public', 'had', 'access', 'many', '34', 'coming', 'age', '34', 'movies', 'most', 'dealing', 'boys', 'sparse', 'version', 'girl', 'COA', 'movie', 'use', 'word', '34', 'sparse', '34', 'positive', 'sense', 'viewer', 'invited', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'make', 'jumps', 'plot', 'lines', 'assumptions', 'motivations', '8230', '.essentially', 'become', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'viewers', 'lovely', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'chronically', 'difficult', 'paradigm', 'daughter', 'mother', 'fantasy', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'finely', 'drawn', 'cast', 'even', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'Country', '/Western', 'implications', 'association', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'involvement', 'graciously', 'minimal', 'yet', 'essential', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'time', 'will', 'reverberate', 'long', 'movie']",The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom

It is nicely produced, doesn't attempt to go over the top and for that it works.It is a good small time movie.

1505888,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B005ZKTGTG,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[23, 23]","""The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom"" is an independent Canadian film produced by a Montreal-based producer that tells the story of a little 11 year old girl living in the Prairies in Canada in 1976. She discovers she is adopted and one day while watching television sees Dolly performing ""I Will Always Love You"" on her then syndicated television show called ""Dolly"" and imagines Dolly is her birth mother. She then is determined to cross the border to the U.S. where Dolly is having a concert to confront her.The story is amusing, heart-felt and emotional and even if your not a fan of Dolly's (but who isn't?) this movie will tug at your heartstrings. It really shows what children go through when they find out they are adopted at a later age and the importance it is to know their paternal parents.Dolly Parton loved the movie, but upon seeing it asked that some profanities be removed from the film before she allowed several of her songs be allowed in it. Some great Dollys tunes(sung by Canadian artists) are included and among them are ""The Seeker"", ""Light of a Clear Blue Morning"", ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"". Dolly even does some voice over work for the movie that was recorded in Nashville.There is also a CD soundtrack that accompanies the movie.""The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom"" isn't the only Dolly-related independent movie made during 2011. ""From Hollywood to Dollywood"" featuring real-life twins Gary and Larry Lane debut at many theatres and that too is a beautiful and wonderful film.",5,"""Precious and Cute""",1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,1513,"['Year', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Was', 'My', 'Mom', 'independent', 'Canadian', 'film', 'produced', 'Montreal-based', 'producer', 'story', 'little', '11', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'living', 'Prairies', 'Canada', '1976', 'adopted', 'one', 'day', 'watching', 'television', 'sees', 'Dolly', 'performing', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'then', 'syndicated', 'television', 'show', 'called', 'Dolly', 'imagines', 'Dolly', 'birth', 'mother', 'then', 'determined', 'cross', 'border', 'U.S.', 'where', 'Dolly', 'having', 'concert', 'confront', 'her.The', 'story', 'amusing', 'heart-felt', 'emotional', 'even', 'not', 'fan', 'Dolly', 'who', ""n't"", 'movie', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'really', 'what', 'children', 'go', 'when', 'find', 'are', 'adopted', 'later', 'age', 'importance', 'know', 'paternal', 'parents.Dolly', 'Parton', 'loved', 'movie', 'seeing', 'asked', 'profanities', 'be', 'removed', 'film', 'allowed', 'several', 'songs', 'be', 'allowed', 'great', 'Dollys', 'tunes', 'sung', 'Canadian', 'artists', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'Seeker', 'Light', 'Clear', 'Blue', 'Morning', 'Jolene', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'Dolly', 'even', 'voice', 'work', 'movie', 'was', 'recorded', 'Nashville.There', 'also', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'Year', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Was', 'My', 'Mom', ""n't"", 'only', 'Dolly-related', 'independent', 'movie', 'made', '2011', 'Hollywood', 'Dollywood', 'featuring', 'real-life', 'twins', 'Gary', 'Larry', 'Lane', 'debut', 'many', 'theatres', 'too', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'film']",The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom
