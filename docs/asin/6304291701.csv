413422,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6304291701,Char,"[0, 0]","The Robinson family (consisting of father, mother, two teen sons, and a boy about 7) suffers ship wreck on the doorstep of a tropical island paradise.  Without much hope of immediate rescue, they set up housekeeping using the remains of ship fittings and furniture which fortunately include, among other things, an organ (that the mother can play), a beautiful tea set, other fine dishes, and apparently even a pretty 19th century-style salvaged wardrobe for the mother! (But some inventive leaf and straw clothing turns up later in the story, as well.)  The males cleverly build a nice tri-partite tree house, which any kid and most adults would really LOVE to have for their own!(Is better than any ""Peter Pan"" tree house that I've seen.)The tale abounds with animals, both domestic and wild.  The youngest boy is an unsinkable adventurer who brings home charming animals as family pets.  There are rollicking races in which even wild ostriches serve as steeds for the children.  (These are fascinating scenes, unique--I haven't seen anything like them before.)Paradise is not without its evil-serpentish element, though, and some terrifying pirates come onto the scene.  There is a romantic sub-plot in which a teen-age boy turns out to be a teen-age girl.I'm not sure if this story is still considered a Classic of Children's Literature--so much has come along in recent times to push out the classic stories (and traditional fairy tales) that children used to learn.  This movie, so charmingly created by Disney Studios, is rather old now but I think it would still probably appeal to young children from about ages 7-11, especially because of the tree house and the many fascinating domestic and wild animals.  (After seeing it, some kids may beg their parents for  baby elephants and monkeys.  I know I would have done.)  Adults may find the story a bit slow or boring, but would probably enjoy viewing it if doing so along with their children.This is a MUCH better story and movie than ""Treasure Island,"" which has some similar elements (mainly pirates) and was made roughly around the same time.All things considered, it's a delightful movie with lots of innocent fun, well worth seeing.  Over-all enforces non-materialistic values--the ""simple"" happy life close to nature.Might be able to pick up some practical hints to aid in wilderness survival, but not much.",5,"Delightful movie, innocent, fun.

413426,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6304291701,Chrijeff,"[2, 3]","Viewers who've read Johann Wyss's originalThe Swiss Family Robinson (Signet Classics)will see right away the mix of closeness to the original and Disney improvement in this family adventure.  (Wyss's family had four sons, not three, and he *did* make a reference to Malay pirates at one point, though he never introduced them.)  In the era of Napoleon, a restless Swiss office worker (John Mills) uproots his wife (Dorothy McGuire) and three sons--impulsive yet down-to-earth Fritz (James MacArthur), 20; scholarly Ernst (Tommy Kirk), 17; and adventurous, imaginative Francis (Kevin Corcoran), ten--and heads for the new colony of New Guinea.  But when their ship is threatened by a Malay pirate, the captain runs--right into a storm--and by the time she grounds on a reef, the family, trapped in their cabin by falling debri, are the only humans left aboard.  Salvaging everything they can move, including an assortment of farm animals and the Captain's two Great Danes, they settle down on the nearby island to await rescue.  But Father and the boys don't believe in sitting on their hands, and soon they have a splendid tree house and a thriving establishment.  Then Fritz and Ernst, exploring the coastline in a dugout canoe, rescue a young hostage from pirate captors--a supposed cabin boy who turns out to be a 16-year-old British girl named Roberta (Janet Munro).  And that, in turn, brings the pirates down on them resolved to get the ransom money she's worth.Like Wyss's prototype, the family's island (trivia: that their name is Robinson is never specified; in fact Wyss probably took his title from the tale of another famous castaway,Robinson Crusoe (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N; Classics)), supposedly located somewhere off the Malay Peninsula, harbors an unlikely assortment of wildlife--not only expected animals like tigers and Asiatic elephants, but also hyenas, zebras, ostriches, and even toucans.  (And who said zebras can't be tamed?  Roberta rides one.)  Yet it's a beautiful, idyllic place which, says Father, can supply everything they really need.  The rivalry that springs into life between Fritz and Ernst after Roberta joins the company is perhaps a bit overdone, but when the pirates arrive all jealousies are forgotten and everyone pulls together to fight them.

413445,A3A03ETOTJRR0T,6304291701,DonnaReviews,"[6, 7]","""The Swiss Family Robinson"" probably bears little relation to the novel by Johann Wyss, but Walt Disney's intention was to create an escapist fantasy for the family audience, not to faithfully recreate the novel evidently.  A New Guinea-bound family is shipwrecked by pirates and manages to transport the booty from the partially-submerged ship to an island where they create their own paradise replete with Kon Tiki-style treehouse.  It's innocuous and pleasant enough with some wonderful cinematography (especially in the dramatic opening of the shipwreck and then the journey on raft by the Robinson family to exotic shores -- really, the island of Tobago in the West Indies) and yet I felt their situation could have been given a tad more authenticity.  Instead, they cavort carelessly on an island abounding with an improbable array of wild animals (including a tiger and speckled anaconda) and encounters become like mini-""thrill rides"" that pop up and quickly end.  For instance, no less than six hyenas surrounding a mud-submerged zebra are chased away with stones by our heroes as if they were dogs and then the scene is magically free of threat.  Still, there is action and the action keeps things moving.Although I can certainly appreciate the ""deserted island"" fantasy here, I was nonetheless not entirely enchanted.  Jane Wyman is predictably the reserved mother, tsking her adventurous boys (including father John Mills); Kevin Corcoran tries patience as the boisterous kid Frances (although I found his curiosity realistic enough) with his calculated cuteness.  Still, it's a high quality production and kind of fun in spite of the two-dimensional characters, so I rate it highly.  I love the song ""My Heart is an Island"" sung here by Jane Wyman and hearing it was a highlight.  Disney made a lot of masterpieces like ""Mary Poppins,"" not to mention so many of his animated films, and I'd say this is good, but not quite in that league of great.As for the extras:  usually I don't like extras, particularly when cast members or directors talk over the film, but I must say the extras here were terrific.  They include enjoyable, interesting commentary; a cartoon short; a mini sequence about Disney pirates; an entertaining film about the making of ""Swiss Family Robinson""; and a short about the opening of Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse in Disneyland narrated by Hayley Mills.

And this from a big Disney fan, but this was not one of Uncle Walt's better efforts.The storyline just stretches simple logic one time too many, ok for children, they won't care. But it will leave most adults rolling their eyes. The first leap of faith comes when our brave castaways tow tons of equipment from the wrecked ship, then build the sort of treehouse you only see illustrated in a Dr. Seuss story. The not-so-humble abode is complete with running water and a pipe organ....For crying out loud, if all that energy had been spent on building a boat, they've could have been off the island already. But then, we wouldn't have a story, would we?Can you say 'Gilligan's Island'?And somehow, animals not native to any Pacific island are roaming around, including zebra and elephants. And incredibly, they're not afraid of humans. Heck, the family even learns to ride and race ostriches! Only in a Disney film....Among other distractions....as is so often the case in family films of this ilk, the writer(s) seem to go out of their way to put in at least one character that's so annoying, you want to strangle them. And here, it's the family's youngest son, Francis. A prime candidate for Ritalin who runs his mouth constantly and gets in more trouble than any normal kid would. The other is the subplot involving the two oldest brothers, Ernst and Fritz (Tommy Kirk and James MacArthur), who were getting along nicely until they get their first whiff of female tail in the form of pixie-ish redhead Roberta (Janet Munro), who had been disguised as a cabin boy to protect her from the pirates. Now the boys are sniping at one another and even trade blows, more than once, thanks to those vicious male hormones, and the fact that Roberta is the only available girl on the island. One might argue there's a grain of truth here, but far too much time was spent on the brothers' rivalry.The final assault of the pirates advancing on the family's hilltop stronghold just dissolves into stupidity. One of the first weapons the Robinsons unleash are some crossbows, which magically, only hit the pirates in their backsides. Not a single mortal wound! This is soon followed by an avalanche of rocks...some almost as large as a house, but again, the pirates get back up and keep coming. A barrage of coconut grenades proves only mildly distracting (what, no coconut shell shrapnel??), and even another avalanche, this time palm logs weighing thousands of pounds, fails to kill the pirates. It's only when our intrepid heroes break out the rifles do they actually start taking out some of the bad guys. Director Ken Annakin may have played this for laughs, but it just came off as silly.I don't know....sometimes a film just hits you the wrong way and this one did. I didn't like it, even as a kid. On the plus side, it's a very family-friendly film. Something that's getting rare nowadays. And it IS a Disney production. Nicely photographed with exotic locations and rich, vibrant color. It's a shame that Dorothy McGuire, a lovely and talented actress, didn't have a larger role here. All told, not a bad film, but certainly more for children than adults looking for good entertainment.",2,File under 'whimsical farce'.,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,3281,"['Pass', 'one', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'childhood', ""'re"", 'buying', 'kids', 'big', 'Disney', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'better', 'efforts.The', 'storyline', 'just', 'stretches', 'simple', 'logic', 'one', 'time', 'too', 'many', 'ok', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'adults', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'first', 'leap', 'faith', 'when', 'brave', 'castaways', 'tow', 'tons', 'equipment', 'wrecked', 'ship', 'then', 'build', 'sort', 'treehouse', 'only', 'see', 'illustrated', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'story', 'not-so-humble', 'abode', 'complete', 'running', 'water', 'pipe', 'organ', '.For', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'energy', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'building', 'boat', ""'ve"", 'could', 'have', 'been', 'off', 'island', 'already', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'would', 'Can', 'say', 'Island', 'somehow', 'animals', 'not', 'native', 'Pacific', 'island', 'are', 'roaming', 'around', 'including', 'zebra', 'elephants', 'incredibly', ""'re"", 'not', 'afraid', 'humans', 'Heck', 'family', 'even', 'ride', 'race', 'ostriches', 'Only', 'Disney', 'film', '.Among', 'other', 'distractions', '.as', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'family', 'films', 'ilk', 'writer', 'seem', 'go', 'way', 'put', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'so', 'annoying', 'want', 'strangle', 'here', 'family', 'youngest', 'son', 'Francis', 'A', 'prime', 'candidate', 'Ritalin', 'who', 'mouth', 'constantly', 'more', 'trouble', 'normal', 'kid', 'would', 'other', 'subplot', 'involving', 'two', 'oldest', 'brothers', 'Ernst', 'Fritz', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'who', 'were', 'getting', 'along', 'nicely', 'get', 'first', 'whiff', 'female', 'tail', 'form', 'pixie-ish', 'redhead', 'Roberta', 'Janet', 'Munro', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'disguised', 'cabin', 'boy', 'protect', 'pirates', 'Now', 'boys', 'are', 'sniping', 'one', 'even', 'trade', 'blows', 'more', 'once', 'thanks', 'vicious', 'male', 'hormones', 'fact', 'Roberta', 'only', 'available', 'girl', 'island', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'grain', 'truth', 'here', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'brothers', 'rivalry.The', 'final', 'assault', 'pirates', 'advancing', 'family', 'hilltop', 'stronghold', 'just', 'stupidity', 'One', 'first', 'weapons', 'Robinsons', 'unleash', 'are', 'crossbows', 'magically', 'only', 'hit', 'pirates', 'backsides', 'Not', 'single', 'mortal', 'wound', 'soon', 'followed', 'avalanche', 'rocks', 'almost', 'as', 'large', 'house', 'again', 'pirates', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'keep', 'coming', 'barrage', 'coconut', 'grenades', 'only', 'mildly', 'distracting', 'what', 'coconut', 'shell', 'shrapnel', 'even', 'avalanche', 'time', 'palm', 'logs', 'weighing', 'thousands', 'pounds', 'kill', 'pirates', 'only', 'when', 'intrepid', 'heroes', 'break', 'out', 'rifles', 'do', 'actually', 'start', 'taking', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'Director', 'Ken', 'Annakin', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'laughs', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'silly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'just', 'wrong', 'way', 'one', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'kid', 'plus', 'side', 'very', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'Something', 'getting', 'rare', 'nowadays', 'Disney', 'production', 'Nicely', 'photographed', 'exotic', 'locations', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'color', 'shame', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'lovely', 'talented', 'actress', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'larger', 'role', 'here', 'told', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'certainly', 'more', 'children', 'adults', 'looking', 'good', 'entertainment']",Swiss Family Robinson VHS

Disney provided a strong cast, featuring John Mills and Dorothy McGuire as Father and Mother Robinson, and James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran as their children. If the movie deviates just a bit from the original story, it compensates with fun, family-safe entertainment.As the story opens, the Swiss Family Robinson, on their way to a colony in New Guinea, find themselves trapped on a storm-tossed ship, after the crew abandons them to escape pirates. A shipwreck leaves the family on a deserted island. Nothing daunted, the family salvages supplies and materials from the ship to build themselves a new home, complete with crops and pets.Dramatic tension is provided by repeat appearences of the pirates to endanger the family. One close escape leaves the family with a new member, a former cabin boy rescued from the pirates. The return of the pirates will force the family to stage a desperate last stand to save their new home, in true Disney fashion.&#34;Swiss Family Robinson&#34; has lost none of its charm over the years, and is highly recommended to fans of the Disney tradition of family movies.",4,Finest family fun...,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,1326,"['34', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', '34', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Production', 'superb', '1960', 'adaptation', 'familiar', 'novel', 'Johann', 'Wyss', 'family', 'best', 'being', 'stranded', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Disney', 'provided', 'strong', 'cast', 'featuring', 'John', 'Mills', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Father', 'Mother', 'Robinson', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'children', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'original', 'story', 'fun', 'family-safe', 'entertainment.As', 'story', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'way', 'colony', 'New', 'Guinea', 'find', 'trapped', 'storm-tossed', 'ship', 'crew', 'escape', 'pirates', 'shipwreck', 'family', 'deserted', 'island', 'Nothing', 'daunted', 'family', 'supplies', 'materials', 'ship', 'build', 'new', 'home', 'complete', 'crops', 'pets.Dramatic', 'tension', 'provided', 'repeat', 'appearences', 'pirates', 'endanger', 'family', 'One', 'close', 'escape', 'family', 'new', 'member', 'former', 'cabin', 'boy', 'rescued', 'pirates', 'return', 'pirates', 'will', 'force', 'family', 'stage', 'desperate', 'last', 'stand', 'save', 'new', 'home', 'true', 'Disney', 'fashion.', '34', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', '34', 'lost', 'none', 'charm', 'years', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Disney', 'tradition', 'family', 'movies']",Swiss Family Robinson VHS

The pirates return.In the meantime, there's loads of fun and adventure.  They gain a new castaway (Janet Munro as Roberta, an inconvenient source of conflict between two brothers, James MacArthur and Tommy Kirk).  The youngest son (played with rambunctious abandonment by Kevin Corcoran), collects as many animals as he can (and in the process also steals the movie from more seasoned actors: Dorothy McGuire and John Mills).  There's plenty of danger and suspense but no expectation of dire consequences.  Everything is handled in such a way that no matter what is tossed at them, from snakes to hyenas, they come through it all unscathed.  Not even a rip-roaring battle sequence, where they are clearly outmanned and outgunned, poses the least little threat to the small commune.  This is as tame and safe as it gets, yet still offers the requisite amount of excitement to make this film highly entertaining.

In a time when family films are few and far between, where even movies categorized as ""Family"" have questionable language at times, and themes.This movie though hits all the right qualities of a great family film, and also leaves out all the questionable language and themes.The plot by itself is intriguing, that of a family shipwrecked with nothing, and then trying to survive in a beautiful but dangerous world.The Cast is superb.  Most of the cast are a part of the Disney stable, most even playing together in multiple other Disney films, but the acting is so flawless, and the story so fresh you forget that you've seen Ernest as shaggy dog and Fritz as an indian (light in the forest an obscure Disney film), or Francis as Toby Tyler.  The two exceptions to this are Father (you'll notice that you never know the name of the Father or the Mother) who is played by John Mills, Hayley Mills' father in real life.  In the extras you see behind the scenes of the families playing, and Hayley is there.  She had just finished shooting Polyanna which is also a great vault disney edition.The other unique cast member is the lead Pirate.  He is a famous japanese actor that in the extras left the rest of the cast awe struck.For me though as good as the cast was, the best parts of the movie are:1.  The island itself, it's completly beautiful.  They filmed the movie on the island of Tobago of the coast of South America.2.  the Tree house,  Every boy at least that has ever watched this movie has dreamed about having a house just like this.3.

The movie is lots of fun, I enjoyed all of the characters and all of the animals.  The big race near the end is a classic!  The commentary on that scene is great, too.  The movie takes place over the course of a year or so, I suppose, and writer and director do a good job of showing just enough detail about one sequence before moving the story forward--treehouse under construction then done, etc.  A journey's start, middle, and end, etc.  The pacing is fine, the film doesn't drag, in my opinion.The brothers are fun, the father is great, and if the women characters are dated...well, there's nothing completely unforgiveable here.  There's no blood, it's family fare, but it rings emotionally true, and I enjoyed all the different relationships between the characters.The special features are great!  I've got to say that all of the Disney Vault dvds have the most awesome special features around, and they lay them on thick--there's so much to see!  I especially enjoyed the making of feature, and the commentary on the main film.  I decided to buy Pollyana after buying Parent Trap and this one just because the Vault treatment is that good--the second disc is like a very enjoyable history lesson.  As for the commentary, they should have just included Kirk, MacArthur, and the director--the threesome interacts quite nicely, and the separate Corcoran commentary that they edited in just interrupts the flow, even though he had good things to say.  Still--it's a wonderful commentary.I didn't remember the whole film from my childhood (it was actually made a few years before I was born), but I got a number of warm and fuzzy jolts when something came up that I did remember--this was a very enjoyable viewing experience, and the special features are very special indeed.",5,Great Fun,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,1844,"['Wow', 'did', 'pack', 'lot', 'action', '2', 'hours', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'lots', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'animals', 'big', 'race', 'end', 'classic', 'commentary', 'scene', 'great', 'too', 'movie', 'place', 'course', 'year', 'so', 'suppose', 'writer', 'director', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'enough', 'detail', 'one', 'sequence', 'moving', 'story', 'forward', 'treehouse', 'construction', 'then', 'done', 'etc', 'journey', 'start', 'middle', 'end', 'etc', 'pacing', 'fine', 'film', ""n't"", 'drag', 'opinion.The', 'brothers', 'are', 'fun', 'father', 'great', 'women', 'characters', 'are', 'dated', 'well', 'nothing', 'completely', 'unforgiveable', 'here', 'blood', 'family', 'fare', 'emotionally', 'true', 'enjoyed', 'different', 'relationships', 'characters.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'Disney', 'Vault', 'dvds', 'have', 'most', 'awesome', 'special', 'features', 'lay', 'thick', 'so', 'much', 'see', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'feature', 'commentary', 'main', 'film', 'decided', 'buy', 'Pollyana', 'buying', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'one', 'just', 'Vault', 'treatment', 'good', 'second', 'disc', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'history', 'lesson', 'commentary', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'included', 'Kirk', 'MacArthur', 'director', 'threesome', 'interacts', 'quite', 'nicely', 'separate', 'Corcoran', 'commentary', 'edited', 'just', 'interrupts', 'flow', 'even', 'had', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'Still', 'wonderful', 'commentary.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'whole', 'film', 'childhood', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'born', 'got', 'number', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'jolts', 'when', 'something', 'came', 'up', 'did', 'remember', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'indeed']",Swiss Family Robinson VHS

The Swiss Family Robinson are on their way to New Guinea. Chased by pirates on the high seas, their ship runs up against a reef, and they find themselves shipwrecked by a deserted tropical island. They manage to get themselves and all their belongings and animals ashore, intact and none the worse for wear.The mother, played by the lovely Dorothy McGuire, is always clean, perfectly groomed and coiffed. The father, played by the wonderful English actor, John Mills, is positively cheerful the entire film. Talk about optimism. His three sons, played by the hunky James MacArthur, the adorable Tommy Kirk, and the cute-as-a-button Kevin Corcoran, work tirelessly to make their new home into an island paradise.In record time, they build a multi-level house to die for, high up in the trees. Somehow, they manage to get a pipe organ off the wrecked ship, ashore, and up into their multi-level tree house, so that they can sing Christmas Carols at the appropriate time. Kevin Corcoran even has a baby elephant for a pet, and they parade around their sculpted lawn which is surrounded by what appears to be a manicured, English country garden.After a while, two of the boys set out on a home made sail boat to check the terrain around the island. They discover yet another casualty of the pirates' onslaught, delightfully played by Janet Munro. The two older boys are sweet on her, which causes a little fun loving tension. All is well, until the pirates come a-calling on the island, and all you know what breaks loose. Never fear. Rescue is on the way.Who in their right mind, however, would ever want to be rescued from this magical island, where nothing can possibly go wrong, and everyone loves each other?

The book itself was a fantasy with bits and pieces of the new world aggregated onto a single island in the Pacific.  The book fantasy makes for a rousing adventure as a family is wrecked and abandoned near a tropical paradise.We meet the Robinson's at the beginning of the movie.  The Late Dorothy McGuire, who also appeared in Disney's ""Summer Magic,"" ""Old Yeller,"" ""Friendly Persuasion,"" and numerous other movies and television shows, plays Mother Robinson.  The Late Sir John Mills, one of the most beloved actors in England and father of Hayley Mills and Juliet Mills, plays Father Robinson.  James MacArthur, who has been in a number of other Disney films and was Danno in Hawaii Five-O, plays Fritz Robinson.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, also Disney regulars, play Ernst and Francis Robinson.  The Robinson's begin the movie in deep trouble.  They are below decks on a sailing ship that was headed toward New Guinea.  As we later learn, the ship was going to New Guinea when pirates appeared.  The captain evaded the pirates, but ran into a storm.  The crew then abandoned ship, leaving the Robinson's behind.The Robinson's wreck on a reef not far from a beautiful tropical island.  The island is paradise, but paradise with the most interesting collection of wild animals imaginable.  There are zebras, hyenas, a tiger, at least one snake that was an anaconda according to the book, a baby elephant, and ostriches.  Imagine a circus train wrecking on this island and you will get the general picture.  The island also proves to be a very nice play to live, especially after the family recovers as much as possible from the wrecked ship.The family builds a marvelous tree house with running water and a master bedroom suite.  Soon there are sidewalks, games, and a castle of sorts.  Fritz and Ernst encounter Roberta (played by the late Janet Munro), and in addition to surviving on the island, the family gets to witness two young men fighting over the only available girl.Life appears to be going well except for the danger of the pirates, whom the family encounters three times in the movie.  Between the pirates, the wild animals, the shipwreck and fighting over Roberta, this movie is full of non-stop action!Walt Disney put pure magic into this adventure movie.  The story is interesting and easy to follow.  The family conquers adversity, remaining positive throughout.  There is mild violence, but so mild that the movie was able to keep a G rating.  I think this movie is a winner for all but the very youngest family members.This 2-disk release is filled with extras that are generally enjoyable.  There is the short that went with the movie when it was originally released.  There are interviews, making of, and all sorts of related tidbits that make this 2-disk set a must have for fans of this movie.  The best part of all is that this movie is in wide screen, which is enough reason to throw away your old version, especially if you have a wide screen television.I have watched this movie in the theater, on television, and on VHS tape.  As many times as I have watched this movie, I enjoy it each and every time.  Take a trip into the adventuresome past for an outstanding and fun family movie adventure.

413507,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6304291701,microjoe,"[257, 265]","I strongly recommend! Originally released in 1960, the film returned to theatres 4 times in later years. This is absolutely one of the most fun family films the Walt Disney Studios ever made. There is truly something for everyone... comedy, action, adventure, drama, romance, and suspense. Even at 126 minutes in length, it does not feel too long. Starting in the aftermath of a shipwreck, the Swiss family rebuilds their life on an uncharted tropical island. They use the wealth of salvage in livestock, tools, guns, furniture, wood, and more to build a safe home in the trees, complete with running water and other conveniences. The mother and father begin an idealic exhistance with their 3 boys aged 9, 16, and 18. But one day the older boys decide to take a canoe and survey the rest of the island. They stumble across pirates that are attacking the crew of a ship, and rescue the captain's daughter, bringing the wrath of the pirates on them since they are discovered.Directed by Ken Annakin, the movie was filmed on location on the caribbean island of Tobago. While the production went way over budget for a total cost of $4 million, Walt did not get upset with his production team at the time since the film was looking to be success when he reviewed clips from the set.  As it turned out, with subsequent theatre releases, television, and video airing, the film has turned out to be one of the top-grossing films from Disney.The tropical scenery is spectacular as they filmed all over the island; waterfalls, forests, grass plains, flowers, beaches, cliffs, mountains, oceans, streams, and much more. Contributing a tremendous amount to the exotic locale of the movie are animals, pirates, ships, and a tree house to beat all tree houses ever made. Similar to the role the submarine ""Nautilus"" filled in the earlier film ""20,000 Leagues Below the Sea"", the tree house becomes a star in it's own right. The wonderful and inventive home designed by the castaways and from the ships salvage is incredible to behold.Featuring a wonderful cast and crew assembled by Walt himself, Mr. Disney liked to stick with actors he knew could relate to a broad audience. Most of the actors in this film appeared in other Disney movies over the years, many times with other actors from this film. Dorothy McGuire (Old Yeller, Summer Magic), John Mills (Did not appear in other Disney movies, but was Hayley Mills real life father), James MacArthur (Light in the Forest, Third Man on the Mountain, Kidnapped), Kevin Corcoran (A Tiger Walks, Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Bon Voyage, Babes in Toyland, Toby Tyler, Pollyanna), Tommy Kirk (Probably the most proficient of all with Savage Sam, Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Moon Pilot, Bon Voayage, Son of Flubber, The Absent-Minded Professor, Misadventure of Merlin Jones, The Monkeys Uncle, Babes in Toyland), and Janet Munroe (Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Third Man on the Mountain). Most of these actors also appeared in movies for the Walt Disney television weekly anthology show as well.VAULT DISNEY DVD VERSIONThe 2 disc DVD treatment that Disney gave this film is perfect, starting with great packaging and case. It is in Widescreen, the first widescreen release outside of theatres for the film in fact. And what a difference it makes in the beautiful location island vistas of the film. The film has been cleaned up and remastered to its original brilliance with lush colors, great image and depth, it just sparkles. The DVD transfer itself is very well done, a high quality job. The audio is very clean and crisp.DVD EXTRASThe extras on this DVD are what really make the best version released of this film, and they are not all listed here at Amazon or even on the packaging. You have to hunt them down and get creative with your remote. So let me help by telling you what to look for if you buy this... For starters they have the original cartoon that was released with the movie, ""Sea Salts"" allowing you to see this with the kids the way that it is meant to be seen. There is a 2 minute ""1960 Disney Studio Album"", a montage of projects, attractions, shows, and films being made and released that year. There is an audio commentary as an alternate track that features comments from cast and crew.Next we have 23 minutes from a vintage Walt Disney television ""Wonderful World of Disney"" episode titled ""Escape to Paradise"", that show the making of the film behind the scenes.  Up next is the original 1960 movie theatre trailers for the film, and the 1960 televison spots to advertise the film. Then there are ""Storyboard to Scene Comparisons""; a seperate ""Storyboard Gallery""; and a 2 minute ""Production Gallery"" of photo stills from behind the scenes at location. Another gallery is full of production stills; Next is ""Biographies"" on 8 principle actors; and then ""Concept Art"" on the films pre-production design work.As if that's not enough a featurette titled ""Adventure in the Making"" was made just for this set, and at 49:00 minutes long it is very complete and satisfying, with recent interviews of the original cast and crew. There is great behind the scenes original footage in this piece, and the folks regale us with funny stories of the filming days. Peter Elleshaw (matte artist), Ken Annakin (director), Danny Lee (special effects), and actors John Mills, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran are all here for modern interviews.  ANOTHER short 4 minute featurette that was also made just for this set is ""Swiss Family Treehouse"", narrated by Hayley Mills (Pollyana, Parent Trap, That Darn Cat, Summer Magic, In Search of the Castaways, The Moon-Spinners), . It is the pre-opening footage and the actual Opening Ceremony of the ""Swiss Family Robinson's Tree House"" attraction (now gone, replaced with Tarzans Tree House) at the Disneyland Park. Walt Disney himself is there and it is evident he is really enjoying himself in this must-see footage.Included on the set is a very nice 12 minute interview with James MacArthur, who appeared in this film and 3 others for Disney along with a TV movie. This features great video as well. There is a ""Pirates"" music video sing along featuring pirate themed clips from Disney films, TV shows, cartoons, and the theme park attraction ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", all set to the Disney tune of ""Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me"". An unusual or unexpected extra is a featurette that has 20 minutes of excerpts from a 1940 non-Disney version of the story.The dvd set has Audio Archives set to photos from the film, including 2 Interactive Sound Studios, 2 songs from the film, original 1960 radio spots. Another real treat is the complete LP soundtrack of the original ""Storybook Album"" of the movie released in 1960.SUMMARYI really enjoyed this DVD, and this film really got the best of treatment by Disney. They simply outdid themselves and I am one grateful viewer. I wish all the really good classic Disney films got at least some of this royal treatment. They have a reputation as the best studio about protecting their old source material, archives, etc, but they are not always generous in using it for their DVD's so I can really appreciate the effort here by the decision makers. Thank you Disney for this compilation that really honors this gem of a film the way it should be!!!! My highest recommendation if you are considering buying this DVD.",5,Loaded special DVD deserves more than 5 stars,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,7363,"['strongly', 'recommend', 'Originally',

When a family is shipwrecked on a deserted isle they must keep body and soul together and ward off pirates from the mainland, just to stay alive.By far, this is the best represented of all of the ""Vault Disney"" series.  The transfer for this DVD is by far the best this film has ever looked.  Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Having said that there is still some edge enhancement and shimering of fine details that distracts from time to time.  A few scenes are very low in contrast in shadow delineation. The audio is stereophonic and very well represented, though dated. Interesting aside: the film's credits are framed in the 2:20 aspect ratio that the whole film was originally shot in but the rest of the feature falls back to a 2:35:1 aspect ratio - strange!

There were several movies that we saw as a result of the generosity of the paper and  Swiss Family Robinson was one of those.  I saw this movie several times and loved it each time I did so.The Robinson family, made up of father Robinson (John Mills), mother Robinson (Dorthy McGuire), Fritz (James MacArthur), Ernst (Tommy Kirk), Francis (Kevin Corcoran) was sailing to some destination I can't recall when their ship is caught in a storm and smashed on a reef.  The crew and other passengers are all gone, leaving the Robinson's to fend for themselves.  Fortunately, the reef upon which they wrecked was part of an island paradise.  They soon make rafts and load them with provisions from the destroyed ship and find themselves marooned rather comfortably upon their deserted island.  With astounding creativity and ingenuity they turn a spectacular tree into a tree house to end all tree houses.  In fact, when I introduced my youngest daughter to the VHS version of the movie in the late 80's she referred to Swiss Family Robinson as the ""tree house"" movie.Eventually, in an attempt to fully explore their new home, Fritz and Ernst set out to circumnavigate the island.  On this outing they discover Roberta (Janet Munro) disguised as a cabin boy in the clutches of pirates.  Helping him (her) escape they make their way back to their tree house.  They eventually have to face their pirate visitors at the end of the movie in a climatic and gripping show down.Directed by Ken Annakin, Swiss Family Robinson, like Third Man on the Mountain, and other wonderful Disney movies, is a testament to wholesome family movies that are exciting and hold the audience's attention without resorting to adult themes to boost profits. The 50's and early 60's were years that were truly magic at the Disney studios.I highly recommend Swiss Family Robinson to be shared with your children.

I suppose it is possible, but there are tigers (possible from S Asia), monkeys with prehensile tails (only from S America), and ostriches, which I believe are only in Africa.
