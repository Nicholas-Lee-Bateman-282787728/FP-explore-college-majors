The cave scenes were poorly managed and I think some more could have been done with trying to build the story between the &#34;beasts&#34; and those that were trapped in there. The rest of the story moves slowly and just does not come together that well. This amazing elixir and and how it was created seems plausible, but when the son struggles to read a book I found it difficult to build a realistic relationship between how he could be a replacement as the person to help the future.It was just too far fetched and the movie did nothing to support that theory. Other than that you still wanted to know how the characters developed, but they just left you hanging to much that you could just not get into the movie that much.

When one reads the brief story line, you know that it could be a ""stinker"" or worse.  It is about stone-age humans coexisting with mutant humans that were altered by a virus that went out of control in the past. The mutants are contageous and very ugly, violent and somewhat stupid.  Exposure to them turns humans into mutants.Knowing this, I rented and watched this movie.  I enjoyed it! The special effects were good. Sean Bean's role was believable. I watch Sean Bean movies because they are interesting with a lot of action.I did have a few problems with the movie, though.  There was a lot of detail and build-up at the beginning.  Once the quest was on, things rushed along, too fast.  The bad guy was evil enough, and apparently had the tracking skills of Tarzan.  The eye shadow was enough to make the guy appear to be an old rock star.  The deceased father that could read (and taught his son to read) invented the cure for the virus that turned people into mutants, well, that was a bit too unbelievable, since his tribe was using flint spears as weapons. (Where did the father learn to read?)  Other than that, I did enjoy the movie.  I am still searching for a ""stinker"" movie that Sean is in, but I haven't yet.  Sean picks his movies well.  Pardon me if I don't study the names of the many other actors and compare them to other roles they were in.  It is enough to say that they were good. I have found that Walmart and Redbox have many movies with great cover art and plot interest, but the movies are in fact, terrible.

See ""Planet of the Apes ..."" or the '60s ""Time Machine"", not that ""Lost 90 Minutes"" is in their league. The only person of note is Bean and all he has to do is have ""the look""; say a few lines and then pick up the royalties.Most amusing were the mutants who at times had the ""walk like a zombie""; at times gallop like a werewolf; at times fly like a vampire routines going. Talk about touching all your bases.

1427593,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004SZVYD0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 15]","Imagine a primitive land where a haggard tribe battles for survival amongst the dangers of a dwindling food supply and a neighboring horde of mutants. Everyone is dressed in attractively constructed savage-wear, furs and leather draped just so to accentuate nubile young bodies. It may look like a gorgeous location shoot for a trendy modeling fashion layout--but, NO! This is the future! ""The Lost Future"" presents just such a scenario. Set at some time in the indeterminate future, this band of sultry survivors think they are the last people on earth. On a hunting mission, they encroach on the mutant's territory which causes a retaliatory strike. Just who came up with this property division in the first place? And you've got to credit the carnivorous monsters for abiding to the strict letter of the agreement for so long. They can't be all bad! With the tribe and its elders in peril, three young protagonists set out on a quest for help. Luckily, they meet the invaluable Sean Bean who raises questions about everything they were taught to believe.Bean knew one of the adventurer's father, and he thinks that the son just might hold the key to saving mankind. Why? Here's the pivotal plot point. He can read. Yes, apparently no one on earth bothered to pass on even the most minimal of education through the years. This is especially amusing, as every character speaks with modern colloquialisms and phrases. The dialogue is so contemporary, in fact, it really doesn't support the fact that so much time has passed or that we've seemingly regressed in our educational capabilities. The town elders have been reduced to bumbling religious zealots with no instinct for self-preservation. I know that no one is looking for authenticity--I'm just saying. If you are, however, looking for complex mythology or explanation--don't bother. What happened is only mentioned in the vaguest of terms, the mutant issue is completely unexplored, and the miracle cure must just be taken at face value with zero contemplation.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the silliness. And it is well done for this type of B-movie mayhem. A battle with an enormous sloth is well staged and the mutants are like zombies on steroids. The creatures oftentimes hold more entertainment value than the sometimes bland actors. Sam Claflin as the unlikely hero has some strong moments (when he isn't inappropriately flirting in life or death moments). And Bean is so welcome and grounded. His seriousness and weight seem like they might be from another film altogether. Despite the movie's marketing, however, Bean is only a supporting player here--and you miss him when he's off screen. This epic premiered in the U.S. on the SyFy Network and, in truth, it is more solid than most of their endeavors. There is fun to be had with ""The Lost Future"" as long as one's expectations are in check. On the bad movie scale, about 3 1/2 stars--not quite cheesy enough to get an upgrade.

Below, more of my impressions with VERY LIMITED SPOILERS.This film was made for Syfy TV and is a post-apocalyptic SF story about a small tribe of humans, struggling to survive in a country of wild forests and marshes when avoiding mutant beasts which carry a horrible disease. With time most people forgot even how to read and write and as the result of all the hardships the memories of once powerful human civilization are fading. But one day a small ray of hope appears with news that somebody may have found the cure for the disease...With just a minimum effort to improve dialogs and character development this could be actually a good story - but sadly this effort was not made. Characters are barely drafted and stereotyped, dialogs are very poor, there is no humour, acting is wooden and Sean Bean (unlike what is suggested on the cover) appears only briefly. There is only one reasonably good scene, in which tribal people hunt a giant mutant sloth - and that is all. All the rest is total ""Bantha pudu"" as Jabba the Hutt used to say...I threw away the DVD immediately after watching it, as I don't think it was worthy even giving away for charity sale.

1427599,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004SZVYD0,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","'Future' opens with what appears to be stone age hunters desperately looking for food. The obligatory twist: The humans are remnants of our modern civilization, the haggared last few survivors of post-21st Century society.In the storyline, science worked to bring back Ice Age mammals that had gone extinct. However, a horrific and completely unintended consequence was a viral strain that eventually became human-transmittable, a quickly evolving pandemic that infected most of the world's population. The new virus transforming the infected into strong, near-mindless cannibal mutants that continue to be infectious after being turned.The remaining small pockets of humanity have squirreled away, hiding in deep forests and faraway lands - all in an effort to survive. They've long since forgotten the hows or whys, having reverted back to a primitive state; knowing only that they need to stay hidden. And even then, it isn't enough.In 'Future' we follow the story of one of these small enclaves. Life alone is harsh, their numbers continually decreasing. Lack of food, the pressure of continually hiding from the freaks, and omnipresent fear have depressed their ability to procreate - it's only a matter of time before there are just not enough to continue. Unknowingly, their only hope lies from within. One of their young people, an outcast of sorts because he's a thinker amongst a tribe of hunters, the oddball who is relegated to menial and emasculating tasks. But his father, a wanderer and explorer, taught him the old ways; gave him the basic tools to salvation. All he needs is permission to go into the Forbidden Lands, past the point of known territory. To where his father went.But just as the elders disrespect the memory of his dad and outright dismiss his quest -  mutants find their encampment. It's a blood bath as the orgres end up killing and consuming most of the tribe. The few that 'survive' the initial assault end up turning. The remaining clan are stuck hiding in a protective cave with no way out.Can the young man, whom everyone believes is nothing more than a dreamer, find a way to save his people?So-so entertainment with beautiful Eleanor Tomlinson, as Miru, deflecting the worse of the cheapness and making up for quite a bit of the stunningly predictable script.Not sure what's up with Sean Bean who is the featured ""star"" of this second rater. As you can clearly see, he's prominently featured on the cover artwork. Unsurprisingly, he's only in a few scenes. Sean has been doing quite a number of these low-budget productions the last few years.

However, for all its many flaws, it was still an okay movie. You probably wont regret the hour and a half, but you also probably wont remember it a month later.As for the story, the overall premise is actually really cool. A virus caused mutations in the majority of humanity, turning them into mindless killers, and possible cannibals. Not unique by any means. However, the story is set several generations after said apocalypse. Surviving humans have mostly regressed to tribalism and have lost the art of reading and writing among other things.However, there are plenty of ""why did that happen"" or ""why did they just do that"" or ""how did they even figure that out"" moments. For example, how did somebody in a completely illiterate world manage to figure out how to read or write. Why does somebody who defeated a powerful band of warriors wander off to be killed after a pathetic attempt to kill his killer? How does somebody walking manage to arrive at the same spot as a bunch of people on horseback only a few minutes later? There are plenty of those questions that will forever remain unanswered.Getting Sean Bean to accept a role in this flick must have been an inspired moment for the director or producer. I cant imagine how they convinced him, but they did.

1427616,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004SZVYD0,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","""The Lost Future"" (2010) is definitive proof that TV films can rise to greatness. It's a sci-fi/adventure hybrid in the spirit of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes,"" but without the apes.THE PLOT: In a post-apocalyptic world a small tribe of hunters & gatherers are forced to go beyond their normal hunting grounds to secure meat, which enables the ""beasts"" to find their village and attack. These ""beasts"" are actually diseased humans who are mad and zombie-like. Their disease spreads through bites, scratches or even breath. Three members of the tribe escape the siege in the hope of finding help from people outside their hunting grounds. They soon learn of a powder that can make them immune to the disease. Can they get the help they need and return to their besieged families before it's too late?Although there are no apes, the similarities to ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" are obvious: Both films take place in post-apocalyptic societies, both feature people living in primitive conditions, both include human mutants, and both include hot cavebabes. The films differ in that their plots are totally different and ""The Lost Future"" has a lot more action; plus ""The Lost future"" - although completely serious - has a slightly more comic book vibe.Some have compared ""The Lost Future"" to theMad Max (Special Edition)filmsThe Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Double Feature)but this isn't really true since there aren't any motorized vehicles or cops, not to mention it's more serious and all-around better IMHO.Like the first two installments in the ""Planet of the Apes"" series and all great sci-fi films ""The Lost Future"" addresses important themes beyond the surface story. For instance, the downside of religion is addressed: Religionists tend to turn inward and stagnate in the name of conservatism, while truth-seekers look beyond the limiting parameters set by the religious rulers (a type of legalists, like the Pharisees and teachers of the law in the New Testament). The false doctrines and flawed mentalities of the religionists may temporarily keep the tribe (or church or denomination) safe but they're ultimately detrimental since only the truth can set free, as Jesus himself declared (John 8:31-32). This is just a taste; there's more subtext, like selfless sacrifice for the greater cause.The protagonists are all likable and honorable with Sam Claflin standing out as Kaleb, an underdog who rises to the challenge. An interesting side note is that Caleb in the Bible, along with Joshua, were honored by God for having a ""different spirit"" - a spirit of faith. This is the only hope for Kaleb's tribe in the film - the wild, bold faith it takes to break free of the confines of the religionists to find the truth and freedom, for him and his people. Corey Sevier and Sean Bean also have important masculine roles.The film features two outstanding women: The breathtaking Annabelle Wallis as Dorel, the main female protagonist, and the incredible Hannah Tointon as Giselle, who plays a significant role in the final act. Also worthy of mention is Eleanor Tomlinson as the precious Miru, Kaleb's sister who does her best to survive the cave-siege.The film has a worthy villain with Jonathan Pienaar as the arrogant Gagen, who also doesn't appear until the last act. Since Gagen possesses the last of the immunization powder he also controls the remaining human populace. Unfortunately he's gotten used to his position of power and therefore isn't open to ideas that are for the greater good of humanity.Another plus is the magnificent locations, shot in Capetown and Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Outstanding job on this front. In addition, although this is a low-budget TV film the sets and CGI (like the giant sloth) are quite impressive.At a lean 91 minutes there's no fat.FINAL SAY: The low-ratings by other reviewers are totally inexplicable. Don't believe them. ""The Lost Future"" is an excellent modern sci-fi adventure in the spirit of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes."" Although made-for-TV, It's a hidden gem in a sea of cinematic drek.GRADE: A",5,A hidden gem in a sea of drek,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,4097,"['Lost', 'Future', '2010', 'definitive', 'proof', 'TV', 'films', 'can', 'rise', 'greatness', 'sci-fi/adventure', 'hybrid', 'spirit', 'Beneath', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'apes.THE', 'PLOT', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'small', 'tribe', 'hunters', 'gatherers', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'normal', 'hunting', 'grounds', 'secure', 'meat', 'beasts', 'find', 'village', 'attack', 'beasts', 'are', 'actually', 'diseased', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'mad', 'zombie-like', 'disease', 'bites', 'scratches', 'even', 'breath', 'Three', 'members', 'tribe', 'siege', 'hope', 'finding', 'help', 'people', 'hunting', 'grounds', 'soon', 'learn', 'powder', 'can', 'make', 'immune', 'disease', 'Can', 'get', 'help', 'need', 'return', 'besieged', 'families', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'apes', 'similarities', 'Beneath', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'are', 'obvious', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'post-apocalyptic', 'societies', 'feature', 'people', 'living', 'primitive', 'conditions', 'include', 'human', 'mutants', 'include', 'hot', 'cavebabes', 'films', 'differ', 'plots', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'Lost', 'Future', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'Lost', 'future', 'completely', 'serious', 'slightly', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'vibe.Some', 'have', 'compared', 'Lost', 'Future', 'theMad', 'Max', 'Special', 'Edition', 'filmsThe', 'Road', 'Warrior', '/', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Beyond', 'Thunderdome', 'Double', 'Feature', ""n't"", 'really', 'true', 'are', ""n't"", 'motorized', 'vehicles', 'cops', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'serious', 'all-around', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'series', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Lost', 'Future', 'important', 'themes', 'surface', 'story', 'instance', 'downside', 'religion', 'addressed', 'Religionists', 'tend', 'turn', 'inward', 'stagnate', 'name', 'conservatism', 'truth-seekers', 'look', 'limiting', 'parameters', 'set', 'religious', 'rulers', 'type', 'legalists', 'Pharisees', 'teachers', 'law', 'New', 'Testament', 'false', 'doctrines', 'flawed', 'mentalities', 'religionists', 'may', 'temporarily', 'keep', 'tribe', 'church', 'denomination', 'safe', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'detrimental', 'only', 'truth', 'can', 'set', 'free', 'Jesus', 'declared', 'John', '8:31-32', 'just', 'taste', 'more', 'subtext', 'selfless', 'sacrifice', 'greater', 'cause.The', 'protagonists', 'are', 'likable', 'honorable', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'standing', 'out', 'Kaleb', 'underdog', 'who', 'challenge', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'Caleb', 'Bible', 'Joshua', 'were', 'honored', 'God', 'having', 'different', 'spirit', 'spirit', 'faith', 'only', 'hope', 'Kaleb', 'tribe', 'film', 'wild', 'bold', 'faith', 'break', 'free', 'confines', 'religionists', 'find', 'truth', 'freedom', 'people', 'Corey', 'Sevier', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'also', 'have', 'important', 'masculine', 'roles.The', 'film', 'features', 'two', 'outstanding', 'women', 'breathtaking', 'Annabelle', 'Wallis', 'Dorel', 'main', 'female', 'protagonist', 'incredible', 'Hannah', 'Tointon', 'Giselle', 'who', 'significant', 'role', 'final', 'act', 'Also', 'worthy', 'mention', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'precious', 'Miru', 'Kaleb', 'sister', 'who', 'best', 'survive', 'cave-siege.The', 'film', 'worthy', 'villain', 'Jonathan', 'Pienaar', 'arrogant', 'Gagen', 'who', 'also', ""n't"", 'appear', 'last', 'act', 'Gagen', 'last', 'immunization', 'powder', 'also', 'remaining', 'human', 'populace', 'Unfortunately', 'gotten', 'used', 'position', 'power', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'open', 'ideas', 'are', 'greater', 'good', 'humanity.Another', 'magnificent', 'locations', 'shot', 'Capetown', 'Western', 'Cape', 'South', 'Africa', 'places', 'Outstanding', 'job', 'front', 'addition', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'film', 'sets', 'CGI', 'giant', 'sloth', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive.At', 'lean', '91', 'minutes', 'fat.FINAL', 'SAY', 'low-ratings', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'totally', 'inexplicable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Lost', 'Future', 'excellent', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'spirit', 'Beneath', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'made-for-TV', 'hidden', 'gem', 'sea', 'cinematic', 'drek.GRADE']",The Lost Future [Blu-ray]
