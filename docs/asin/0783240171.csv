68126,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,0783240171,Andre Dursin,"[5, 6]","Universal's 100th Anniversary series of DVD and Blu-Ray releases has kicked into gear with a cleaned up, and much improved, Blu-Ray of OUT OF AFRICA (2012 release).Robert Redford stars as a British big game hunter whom writer Karen Blixen becomes enthralled with while helping her husband work on a coffee farm in Kenya; Meryl Streep essays the author, while Klaus Maria Brandauer is her philandering spouse. Together, they form a romantic triangle sumptuously filmed by director Sydney Pollack and cinematographer David Watkin, and beautifully scored by John Barry. The settings and photography remain the highlights of this Oscar-winning 1985 romantic drama, which tends to drag on at 161 minutes but always remains a pleasure to look at.On Blu-Ray, its scenic attributes ought to be magnified, but that wasn't the case with Universal's first stab at bringing the movie to BD in 2010: that release's VC-1 encoded transfer was overly processed with DNR and generally derided as a flat-out disaster.That botched release, happily, has been rectified with Universal's 100th Anniversary Digibook package of ""Out of Africa"": the new AVC encoded 1080p transfer offers fine detail, no apparent use of noise reduction, and beautiful colors that add immeasurably to Watkin's cinematography. This is the release that fans should've gotten a couple of years ago, and it's complimented here by a DVD and the same extras from the prior video releases. Several minutes of deleted scenes are included (in SD) while Pollack delivers an informative commentary track on the making of the picture. Universal has also reprieved Charles Kiselyak's fine documentary ""Song of Africa,"" which includes interviews with Pollack, Meryl Streep, and Isak Dinesen biographer Judith Thurman. Film music buffs will certainly be interested in the comments of John Barry, who talks at length in the program about his score, the creation of the movie's central sweeping theme, and use of music in various sequences.",5,The New 2012 Blu-Ray Does Justice to the Film,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1980,"['Universal', '100th', 'Anniversary', 'series', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'releases', 'kicked', 'gear', 'cleaned', 'up', 'much', 'improved', 'Blu-Ray', 'OUT', 'OF', 'AFRICA', '2012', 'release', '.Robert', 'Redford', 'British', 'big', 'game', 'hunter', 'whom', 'writer', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'enthralled', 'helping', 'husband', 'work', 'coffee', 'farm', 'Kenya', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'author', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'philandering', 'spouse', 'Together', 'form', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'sumptuously', 'filmed', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'cinematographer', 'David', 'Watkin', 'beautifully', 'scored', 'John', 'Barry', 'settings', 'photography', 'remain', 'highlights', 'Oscar-winning', '1985', 'romantic', 'drama', 'drag', '161', 'minutes', 'always', 'pleasure', 'look', 'at.On', 'Blu-Ray', 'scenic', 'attributes', 'ought', 'be', 'magnified', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'Universal', 'first', 'stab', 'bringing', 'movie', 'BD', '2010', 'release', 'VC-1', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'was', 'overly', 'processed', 'DNR', 'generally', 'derided', 'flat-out', 'disaster.That', 'botched', 'release', 'happily', 'been', 'rectified', 'Universal', '100th', 'Anniversary', 'Digibook', 'package', 'Out', 'Africa', 'new', 'AVC', 'encoded', '1080p', 'transfer', 'offers', 'fine', 'detail', 'apparent', 'use', 'noise', 'reduction', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'add', 'immeasurably', 'Watkin', 'cinematography', 'release', 'fans', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'complimented', 'here', 'DVD', 'same', 'extras', 'prior', 'video', 'releases', 'Several', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'SD', 'Pollack', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'picture', 'Universal', 'also', 'reprieved', 'Charles', 'Kiselyak', 'fine', 'documentary', 'Song', 'Africa', 'interviews', 'Pollack', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'biographer', 'Judith', 'Thurman', 'Film', 'music', 'buffs', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'interested', 'comments', 'John', 'Barry', 'who', 'length', 'program', 'score', 'creation', 'movie', 'central', 'sweeping', 'theme', 'use', 'music', 'various', 'sequences']",N/A

The Blu-Ray release of ""Out Of Africa"" has been eagerly awaited by fans of the film, who have looked forward to enjoying it anew in high definition. Now, unfortunately, it has arrived on one of the detested Universal Studios ""flipper"" discs (DVD on one side, Blu-Ray on the other, no label art). The results could not be more disappointing.The image is cleaner, sharper and ""better"" than the past DVD versions. But that is due entirely to the vastly better bandwidth, 1080p resolution and improved codecs used for Blu-Ray. There is unfortunately excessive edge sharpening, and overwhelming contrast boost. In fact, the over intense contrast levels accentuate the excessive sharpening, calling attention to ringing and halo effects. Surface detail and skin tones frequently have a smeared and over DNRed quality.The only other major film that has proved as disappointing on Blu-Ray, and for the same reasons (too much sharpening, too much DNR, too much contrast boost), is the much vilified release of ""Gladiator"". This has led to a rumored re-release and remasterring of ""Gladiator"". We can only hope that Universal will wake up and do the same with ""Out Of Africa"".Universal ought to be ashamed of themselves for not taking more care with the Blu-Ray release of such a major catalog title. It really needed to be remastered for Blu-Ray. But if they were going to use the old transfer then someone should have at least done some adjustments. As it is, it looks like they just pulled the file off the shelf and shoved it out the door, and in a plain case with cheesy looking artwork, no booklet, etc. Shame on you Universal!",2,"A magnificent classic film, with a Blu-Ray transfer almost worse than Gladiator...",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1725,"['Film', '*****', '|', 'Blu-Ray', '**', 'What', 'travesty', 'Africa', 'beautiful', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Out', 'Africa', 'been', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'fans', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'looked', 'forward', 'enjoying', 'anew', 'high', 'definition', 'Now', 'unfortunately', 'arrived', 'one', 'detested', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'flipper', 'discs', 'DVD', 'one', 'side', 'Blu-Ray', 'other', 'label', 'art', 'results', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'disappointing.The', 'image', 'cleaner', 'sharper', 'better', 'past', 'DVD', 'versions', 'due', 'entirely', 'vastly', 'better', 'bandwidth', '1080p', 'resolution', 'improved', 'codecs', 'used', 'Blu-Ray', 'unfortunately', 'excessive', 'edge', 'sharpening', 'overwhelming', 'contrast', 'boost', 'fact', 'intense', 'contrast', 'levels', 'accentuate', 'excessive', 'sharpening', 'calling', 'attention', 'ringing', 'halo', 'effects', 'Surface', 'detail', 'skin', 'tones', 'frequently', 'have', 'smeared', 'DNRed', 'quality.The', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'film', 'proved', 'disappointing', 'Blu-Ray', 'same', 'reasons', 'too', 'much', 'sharpening', 'too', 'much', 'DNR', 'too', 'much', 'contrast', 'boost', 'much', 'vilified', 'release', 'Gladiator', 'led', 'rumored', 're-release', 'remasterring', 'Gladiator', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Universal', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'do', 'same', 'Out', 'Africa', '.Universal', 'ought', 'be', 'ashamed', 'not', 'taking', 'more', 'care', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'major', 'catalog', 'title', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'remastered', 'Blu-Ray', 'were', 'going', 'use', 'old', 'transfer', 'then', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'done', 'adjustments', 'just', 'pulled', 'file', 'shelf', 'shoved', 'out', 'door', 'plain', 'case', 'cheesy', 'looking', 'artwork', 'booklet', 'etc', 'Shame', 'Universal']",N/A

Both Meryl Streep and Robert Redford are absolutely terrific in playing star-crossed lovers who are also intellectual soul mates in what has to be one of the greatest and yet saddest of all movie love affairs. This is a dramatization culled from the memoirs written by Isak Dinesen about her fateful decision to leave her comfortable but boring life in Scandinavia behind in favor of a much more dangerous and adventurous try at a new life as a married woman in Africa. Blowing her inheritance trying to support her philandering new husband's ill-advised business ventures, she falls in love with the land, the people, and the times. Indeed, out of Africa comes the experience of a young lifetime.In fact, the topography of Africa provides the perfect background and the most splendid of opportunities for her to live her life on her own terms, out of the long and suffocating shadow of family and social convention. And the journey taken by Karen Blixen is a long, joyous, and eventful one, a trip that literally takes her breath away with its rich, varied, and enriching experiences. Yet all this adventure has its cost in pain and suffering, and her growth into a woman of substance who eventually finds her way into a dreamy intellectual played so well by Redford also fates her to become a woman bereft of that that means most to her; her lover, her farm, and her place in Africa itself.This is a lovely film, one that capitalizes by using the dramatic and primitive backdrop of wild Africa in painting a period piece that is unparalleled in its graphic portrayal of life on the very edges of civilization in an epochal time of Africa's evolution to modernity. The cinematography alone is worth the price of the DVD, for anyone who loves nature will recognize Redford's steady hand in influencing the way the fragile yet exquisite sub-Saharan environment is depicted.  I have seen the movie a number of times, and each time come away with a renewed sense of how fragile and wondrous the ecology of this part of Africa is. This is a wonderful movie I can heartily recommend.

68134,A2RXJXY0V58IBX,0783240171,"Bert McCarthy ""Mystic Road Warrior""","[1, 1]","Several false starts over the years in attempting to put this challenging story on the screen finally led to Sydney Pollock's masterly production in 1985. Previously, screen-writers had great difficulty connecting the dots of this highly anecdotal and wide-ranging, subtle story.If Pollock had done nothing else in his career, this great accomplishment alone would make him a towering figure in his field. The DVD features an extensive commentary wherein he provides us with a wealth of enriching material describing the full story of the production. This commentary alone is probably worth the price of the DVD. We learn of Pollack's collaboration with the great John Barry, resulting in what is undeniably one of the most lush and romantic soundtracks to date. We also learn of the difficulties of dealing with lions, hippos, water buffaloes -- and African microbes!Pollack provides a fascinating and lengthy explanation of meeting the challenges of photography at high altitudes near the Equator, where the light is impossibly bright and therefore harsh. He speaks in detail about the wonderful sets and spectacular costumes.He highlights the incredible courage and versatility of Meryl Streep (three ""lion scenes"" - no digital magic in 1985!) How is it possible that our greatest actress has only one Best Actress Oscar? Meryl provides commentary (as do John Barry and Karen Blixen's able biographer, Judith Thompson).And, yes, Robert Redford's ""American accent"" is discussed, and it is hoped that others' silly quibbles about this entirely trivial point can be laid to rest. Redford is magnificent, as usual. The supporting cast is superlative as well.As is the case with ""The English Patient,"" which is the obvious comparison film, ""Out of Africa"" is populated with characters that one would love to have over for dinner: they are very ""real"", unfailingly charming and intelligent.The film is shot on location in Kenya, and, if one can take one's eyes off Streep and Redford, the vistas are unparalleled.I must insist that this film is truly one of the Great Ones.",5,Deserving of all seven Oscars!,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,2070,"['Several', 'false', 'starts', 'years', 'attempting', 'put', 'challenging', 'story', 'screen', 'finally', 'led', 'Sydney', 'Pollock', 'masterly', 'production', '1985', 'Previously', 'screen-writers', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'connecting', 'dots', 'highly', 'anecdotal', 'wide-ranging', 'subtle', 'story.If', 'Pollock', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'else', 'career', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'towering', 'figure', 'field', 'DVD', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'wherein', 'wealth', 'enriching', 'material', 'describing', 'full', 'story', 'production', 'commentary', 'alone', 'probably', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'learn', 'Pollack', 'collaboration', 'great', 'John', 'Barry', 'resulting', 'what', 'undeniably', 'one', 'most', 'lush', 'romantic', 'soundtracks', 'date', 'also', 'learn', 'difficulties', 'dealing', 'lions', 'hippos', 'water', 'buffaloes', 'African', 'microbes', 'Pollack', 'fascinating', 'lengthy', 'explanation', 'meeting', 'challenges', 'photography', 'high', 'altitudes', 'Equator', 'where', 'light', 'impossibly', 'bright', 'therefore', 'harsh', 'detail', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'spectacular', 'costumes.He', 'highlights', 'incredible', 'courage', 'versatility', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'three', 'lion', 'scenes', 'digital', 'magic', '1985', 'How', 'possible', 'greatest', 'actress', 'only', 'one', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Meryl', 'commentary', 'do', 'John', 'Barry', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'able', 'biographer', 'Judith', 'Thompson', '.And', 'yes', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'American', 'accent', 'discussed', 'hoped', 'others', 'silly', 'quibbles', 'entirely', 'trivial', 'point', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'rest', 'Redford', 'magnificent', 'usual', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superlative', 'well.As', 'case', 'English', 'Patient', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'film', 'Africa', 'populated', 'characters', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'over', 'dinner', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'unfailingly', 'charming', 'intelligent.The', 'film', 'shot', 'location', 'Kenya', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'eyes', 'Streep', 'Redford', 'vistas', 'are', 'unparalleled.I', 'must', 'insist', 'film', 'truly', 'one', 'Great', 'Ones']",N/A

This is Karen Blixen's true story of her time in Kenya and her romance with a mercurial hunter who lives with Africa, rather than in it. Karen would leave her spirit and her soul on the wide open plains of this beautiful land, which is the real star of this lush and most romantic of films. Robert Redford and Meryl Streep are both marvelous in this elegant banquet of love and beauty.Karen embarks on a journey to Africa after a marriage of convenience to an old friend. The marriage will turn sour shortly after their arrival to the coffee plantation paid for with her money. His unfaithfulness will bring about an illness that will force her to return home for treatment, or go insane. She has met Denys already, however, and fallen in love with a land and its people, and knows she must come back.The romance of Karen and the enigmatic Denys is languid, like the plains, and their differences vast, like the orange evening skyline.

Denys, however, has been in Africa a long time, and knows all those there are just passing through. He roams the plains and knows no ownership, at least not the kind Karen needs.A flight over Kenya set to John Barry's beautiful score is one of those magical moments in film never to be forgotten.

I must be missing something.  What I saw was a beautifully filmed but rather ponderous vehicle to two mega-stars who circle around each other like glittering birds that do not want to muss their magnificent plumages.  Emotionally, I have rarely found a &quot;romantic&quot; film to be so totally bereft of passion or emotion.I feel this is largely due to Robert Redford playing Robert Redford pretending to be Finch-Hatton.  He just seems to so totally out of place in this film, and I really could care less about his accent.  He just never seems to be anything other than Robert Redford.  In any case, his character, supposedly a free thinker who is more in touch with the Higher Truths that Nature offers, comes off as as a self-absorbed character who never met an emotion he couldn't throw a wall around.  The relationship between Finch-Hatton &amp; Blixen comes off as being so frigid &amp; lifeless that I simply could not relate to it on any level.Meanwhile, the film lumbers along through the Great War (with the producers assuming that viewers are all well acquainted with WWI in East Africa), treating us to great scenic shots.  Yes indeed, the cinematography is great in this film.  All the Brits saddle up, presumably to do battle with von Lettow-Vorbeck, and off they go.  Then they saddle up, and off they go to someplace else.  They spend a great deal of time going off to some distant spot or another.  Eventually some people die, as they are wont to do, and then some more people die.  One of them ends up being Robert Redford, which proves most inconvenient for the story line, and so the movie lumbers towards its end shortly thereafter.This is not a terrible film by any means.  I find the performance of Michael Kitchen (a fine actor who deserves more notice) as Berkeley Cole to be most noteworthy.  Also, the cinematography is quite breath-taking and goes a long ways towards redeeming the movie as a whole.  I also derived great amusement (not intended by the producers) of watching the not exactly diminutive Michael Gough play the (in real life) itty-bitty Hugh Cholmondeley, Lord Delamere.  I laughed every time Delamere was in a scene.Is it a good film?  I suppose so.  Is it a great film?  I don't see how one can really say that.  Is it the most overrated film to win a slew of Oscars?

(For the full version of the music, stay with the ending credits.)In addition to the appreciation of the visuals and soundtrack, I enjoyed the story much more by the third time and Meryl Streep's Danish accent as ""Karen Blixen"" went from annoying to acceptable. It is a romance story and there isn't much action, and parts of it can drag a bit, but not for long.One credibility problem, the other main character: "" Denys,"" played by Robert Redford, was supposed to be British but had a 100 percent American accent.

Streep's character wasn't too far away from that, either.Character-wise, I liked Blixen's husband, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer, probably best in this movie.Social agendas aside, I always enjoy what the rest of the film has to offer: mainly the magnificent African scenery, mellow story and rich music.",4,Liked It A Lot More & More With Each Viewing,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,1496,"['Few', 'movies', 'ever', 'increased', 'ratings', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'did', 'first', 'viewing', 'last', 'one', 'fifth', 'being', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Let', 'hope', 'out', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'sometime', 'near', 'future.Until', 'seeing', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'just', 'how', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'accompanying', 'music', 'score', 'also', 'outstanding', 'main', 'score', 'theme', 'song', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'perhaps', 'prettiest', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'ANY', 'film', 'full', 'version', 'music', 'stay', 'ending', 'credits', 'addition', 'appreciation', 'visuals', 'soundtrack', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'third', 'time', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Danish', 'accent', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'went', 'annoying', 'acceptable', 'romance', 'story', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'parts', 'can', 'drag', 'bit', 'not', 'long.One', 'credibility', 'problem', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Denys', 'played', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'British', 'had', '100', 'percent', 'American', 'accent', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'fake', 'character', 'also', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'secular-humanistic', 'root', 'anyway', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'moral', 'base', 'marriage', 'just', 'sheet', 'paper', 'Streep', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'away', 'either.Character-wise', 'liked', 'Blixen', 'husband', 'played', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'probably', 'best', 'movie.Social', 'agendas', 'aside', 'always', 'enjoy', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'offer', 'mainly', 'magnificent', 'African', 'scenery', 'mellow', 'story', 'rich', 'music']",N/A
68156,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,0783240171,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 4]","I'm new to the Meryl Streep fan club.  Until recently I've just tolerated her presence in a film, but after being forced to watch some of her best material I've become to understand the appeal.  `Out of Africa' was forced on me by my wife about three weeks ago because she swore I would love it, and I'm surprised to say that I did.  Meryl does a beautiful job capturing the heart of this woman, the soul in her that, while was once dying away was able to be restored through the realizations of a love she had never felt before.That woman is acclaimed author Karen Blixen who moved to Africa with her then husband Baron Bror Blixen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) in order to start a cow farm only to find that her husband decided to use her mother's money to start a coffee plantation instead.  Throughout the course of her rocky marriage she suffers from loneliness and despair knowing that her husband, who is always gone on hunting trips with his friends, is have affair after affair, and even though their marriage was more of an agreement (as in she wanted a title and he wanted her money) the feeling of being used starts to take a toll on out heroine.  She soon meets and falls in love with a mysterious hunter Denys (Robert Redford) who may or may not be the man of her dreams.Karen soon realizes that the lack of love she has for herself and her life course is what is making it difficult for her to really love Denys.  I had a conversation prior to watching this film with a friend who swore she hated `Titanic' because the love affair between Jack and Rose was unbelievable.  In the same breath she told me how I needed to watch `Out of Africa' for it was one of the greatest movies ever made.  I'm sorry to disappoint, but I felt that the love affair between Karen and Denys was stale and cold.  I was never really convinced they truly loved one another.  To me though, that doesn't really take away from the point of this film which was about empowerment and realizing your dreams and potential.  Plus, Meryl was so spot on here it brought the film to entirely different level (I'm serious, I am a die hard Streep fan now!).To me this is a different kind of love story, not between man and woman but between a woman and herself, learning to love her lot in life and make it the best she can despite what anything or anyone throws at her.  Karen was a strong willed and passionate woman who was guarded and help captive by the men in her life who all but tied her down, and as she grew she realized she could easily break away and be the woman she always knew she should be.  I felt it a wonderful film, one to be enjoyed again and again.",5,"Meryl stole my heart, and she's had it ever since...",1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2644,"[""'m"", 'new', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fan', 'club', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'just', 'tolerated', 'presence', 'film', 'being', 'forced', 'watch', 'best', 'material', ""'ve"", 'become', 'understand', 'appeal', 'Africa', 'was', 'forced', 'wife', 'three', 'weeks', 'ago', 'swore', 'would', 'love', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'say', 'did', 'Meryl', 'beautiful', 'job', 'capturing', 'heart', 'woman', 'soul', 'was', 'once', 'dying', 'away', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'restored', 'realizations', 'love', 'had', 'never', 'felt', 'woman', 'acclaimed', 'author', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'who', 'moved', 'Africa', 'then', 'husband', 'Baron', 'Bror', 'Blixen', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'order', 'start', 'cow', 'farm', 'only', 'find', 'husband', 'decided', 'use', 'mother', 'money', 'start', 'coffee', 'plantation', 'instead', 'course', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'knowing', 'husband', 'who', 'always', 'gone', 'hunting', 'trips', 'friends', 'have', 'affair', 'affair', 'even', 'marriage', 'was', 'more', 'agreement', 'wanted', 'title', 'wanted', 'money', 'feeling', 'being', 'used', 'starts', 'take', 'toll', 'out', 'heroine', 'soon', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'mysterious', 'hunter', 'Denys', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'man', 'dreams.Karen', 'soon', 'lack', 'love', 'herself', 'life', 'course', 'what', 'making', 'difficult', 'really', 'love', 'Denys', 'had', 'conversation', 'prior', 'watching', 'film', 'friend', 'who', 'swore', 'hated', 'Titanic', 'love', 'affair', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'same', 'breath', 'told', 'how', 'needed', 'watch', 'Africa', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'disappoint', 'felt', 'love', 'affair', 'Karen', 'Denys', 'was', 'stale', 'cold', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'convinced', 'truly', 'loved', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'away', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'empowerment', 'realizing', 'dreams', 'potential', 'Meryl', 'was', 'so', 'spot', 'here', 'brought', 'film', 'entirely', 'different', 'level', ""'m"", 'serious', 'am', 'die', 'hard', 'Streep', 'fan', 'now', '.To', 'different', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'learning', 'love', 'lot', 'life', 'make', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'anything', 'anyone', 'throws', 'Karen', 'was', 'strong', 'willed', 'passionate', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'guarded', 'help', 'captive', 'men', 'life', 'who', 'tied', 'down', 'grew', 'realized', 'could', 'easily', 'break', 'away', 'be', 'woman', 'always', 'knew', 'should', 'be', 'felt', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again']",N/A
68157,A2UEYNUWKVOYPU,0783240171,"Daniel D. Vander Haar ""movie history survivor""","[5, 13]","It seems Africa is quickly becoming the film capital of the world. There is the film Nowhere In Africa, and there is Hotel Rwanda, and this one, Out Of Africa. Hollywood is also making a film called, ""Back To Africa,"" but I think three films is plenty.These stories have a lot in common. Nowhere In Africa and Out Of Africa both deal with adjusting to a new lifestyle based on the African culture. The first film deals with trying to hang on to a family, and not doing very well. The second film deals with trying to find a family, and not doing very well. Hotel Rwanda deals with simply trying to survive as a family, and not doing very well. All three movies are based on true stories, with two of the films based upon books written by a real life central character. Nowhere In Africa was written by the young girl in the movie as an adult, Stefanie Zweig. Out of Africa was written by Isak Dinesen, the pen name of Karen Blixen. In all three movies, war interrupts people's lives. There is also theology in all three films, or at least a lack of theology. Nowhere In Africa deals with a family with no God. Hotel Rwanda has people give thanks to God, and in Out Of Africa, people don't have a clue as to how God relates to them.  And in a telling way, here are some Africans who have lived in the same place for generations, who do not think in terms of owning anything, but simply managing it, basically for God. The whites move into Africa during a time of exploration and settling, basically claiming Africa for their own, and the Africans then become field hands, cooks, and house boys.But within each film, the individual paths diverge. Here in Out Of Africa,  Meryl Streep plays Karen Dinesen, a single woman from Denmark, who has a lot of money, but nowhere to go with it. On a whim, she suggests that she and Bror Blixen marry. She would get some social status by being a married woman, and not just a single woman, and he would get her money, and together they could build a farm in Africa. But this was not a real marriage, but simply a business relationship tied together with paper. Instead of planting vegetables like they agreed, he took her money and without consulting with her planted coffee beans, a high risk venture since no one had successfully done this before at such high altitudes. It was a marriage made in...well, not made in heaven, but the other place.As Karen Dinison is adjusting to life in Africa, she has to learn about chasing away baboons, never going outside alone without a gun, how to fend off lions, and how to be married to one person while developing a romance with someone else. That ""someone else"" is Robert Redford as Denys Hatton, a man who has everything her husband does not have--grace, charm, wit, and style.This movie was a winner of seven Academy Awards. With its lush African setting of beautiful skies, picturesque mountains, and miles upon miles of open flat land, this film has romance written all over it. Roger Ebert called this movie,  ""one of the great recent epic romances.""[...]But what kind of love is this? There was no love in Karen's real marriage, and she expressd her love by being unfaithful to her husband, even if they were married in name only. This same husband gives her syphilis that he got from his sexual activities, and then just when she was focusing in on Redford's character Denys Hatton, she sees a side to him that she didn't see before. His idea of love is not to be tied down to one woman. He may say that he loves her, and maybe he does, but he doesn't have a problem with just taking off and doing his own thing for however long he wants, and even if that involves another woman, a minor character in his life.Perhaps it is the lush settings that disguises this. Or maybe it is the lush, romantic music that sets us up for a love story. Perhaps Denys did change his ways, and his return to Karen Dinison was supposed to show this, but if so, it took him 90% of the movie to reach this point, so what are we supposed to think? Does this last 10% of the movie justify the previous 90%? My idea of love and romance does not involve anything described in this movie. And I don't think the last ten minutes of a movie qualified this film to be called an epic love story. It seems to me that in the same way that ten years of being sober do not justify 30 years of an alcoholic rage, a man can't just forgiven when he ""comes around"" after dividing his love between multiple partners. But in this movie, no one says, ""take me now, or else I'm leaving. Make your choice."" Rather, it is, ""I hate what you do, and there is no real reason that says I have to stay here, but I have decided to take more emotional abuse and just stick around and wait for you to change your way of thinking.""And did Karen Dinison learn anything from her experiences? We don't know. Like the characters in Nowhere In Africa, and Hotel Rwanda, she leaves Africa to start over. Thanks to her real husband, she left Africa financially bankrupt. So why would she risk all of her money on an unknown? If she had any sense, she would have seen this coming, or at least padded her bet a little bit. But movies tend to make heroes out of just about anybody, since we are seeing their story from their perspective. There was, apparently, no one to advise her not to do what she did.The strength of this movie lies in its filmed on location mentality. In fact, the movie used some of Karen Dinison's actual furniture that she left behind when she moved back to Denmark. People are seen sleeping on the ground around a campfire, while real lions stroll through the campsite intent on killing and eating the cattle used to pull wagons. Lions are seen attacking Dinison and Redford's character Hatton at full charge. And with a war on, you don't know if some African natives coming toward you at a steady trot are friends, neutrals, or an enemy.Highlights of the extras are Meryl Streep's commentary. She mimics people and things from this movie to good effect.Robert Redford started his breakthrough film career in films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and The Sting. These roles were definitive standout roles, helped no doubt by his all American boy good looks. But since then, it seems to me any way, most of his films have been films that dealt with non stand out roles that at best told more enjoyable, but low key stories, such as, The Great Waldo Pepper, Brubaker, The Natural, and Legal Eagles. He has received more acclaim for his work behind the camera as a director, but even here some of his films were not big blockbusters, such as The Horse Whisperer. By the time of Out of Africa, his boyish good looks were beginning to peak. But maybe the time has just gone by so fast that before you realize it, Redford has been in this movie business for about 45 years or more.Meryl Streep's career seems to have begun to peak with this movie. At one time she was the definitive actress, but her career seems to have cooled somewhat. She has gone from being a strong stand alone actress to a strong supporting actress in strong movies. But then, she too has been making movies for about 33 years or more, and as you age, good roles are not as easy to come by.Perhaps the defining moment of this movie is when Karen Dinison's husband catches her and Redford's Hatton having breakfast together. The husband and Hatton have this conversation:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Baron Bror Blixen: You could have asked, Denys.Denys: I did. She said yes.So here we have a man who doesn't want to commit himself to anything, whether out of fear or whatever. Yet, he has no problem moving in between a married couple to try and enjoy something that he may not necessarily even stick with, and may end up putting the woman in yet another compromised situation without even intending to marry her. Maybe even destroy her marriage, then walk away.Rather, than this movie being seen as an epic love story, I see it as a film about three people who don't really know what they are doing, who don't place someone else's best interest first, and who don't see the harm they are doing to other people. ""Sorry"" doesn't make the syphilis go away. ""Sorry"" doesn't restore the squandered wealth. And there is no ""sorry"" from a man who refuses to be bound by someone else's idea of love and faithfulness. Just when two people seem to have really found each other, with the husband even out of the way, not so much as an apology. Maybe love still means never having to say you are sorry.So what are we to think of Karen Dinison? She makes poor business decisions, and doesn't keep a close eye on her investments. Her idea of marriage is one where she risks everything without expecting anything of equal value in return. Then she gets involved with a man who is not big on commitments, but she sticks around anyway, even though by this time Africa doesn't owe her a thing. So why not just get up and leave? ""You want me? I'll be in Belgum trying to straighten out my life.""  Most people I know would have a limited patience toward another person who did these kinds of things, but not Karen. There is never a cut off point for her, never a time when it was too late. We are expected to believe that this male thing of a human being would just change his ways without so much as a whimper. And of course, just when they finally find do find each other...love crashes and burns a second time, making Karen a hero, and bringing an epic and h",3,What is love?,1126310400,"09 10,

The woman is a born mimic and her Danish accent threw me off so much that I had to keep looking at her to make sure it was really her.The movie, as pointed out elsewhere, is slow to start. Audiences today wouldn't give it the time... which would be a pity, because it's a beautiful love story played out against the drama of Africa during the early 20th century.The score by John Barry is stunning. It did catch me off guard that it was not more heavily influenced by African instruments, but since it is a love story, that is what John Barry achieved, and gorgeously so.The only weak link in the film is Robert Redford. I don't think he can act, and I don't know why it is that Meryl took the time and trouble to get a perfect Danish accent, while Redford, acting as a British man, didn't even take an elocution lesson with a proper British speaker.But Meryl Streep was so superb that even though the love story is between her and Redford, she, and what she went through and experienced and felt, all so clear on that magnificent face, overshadow all of Redford's weaknesses.If you can be patient through the first 30 minutes are so, you will be rewarded.

68159,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,0783240171,David Michael Cohen,"[12, 51]","Our story opens with Meryl ""look, I'm eeemootiiinng"" Streep addressing the audience in a ridiculous accent that is not, in any way, Danish. She breaks up with the man she loves and then turns to his brother. Since he has money she wants, and he has a title she wants, they decide that they should get married. So basically, our ""romantic heroine"" reveals herself to be a trollop in the first scene. Anyway, Meryl goes south to Africa, and the marriage goes south as well. Gee, marrying for greed seemed like a good idea. Maybe her husband was driven away by that ridiculous, so-non-Danish accent. Meryl then spends what seems like an hour moping about her palatial estate, bemoaning how empty her rich, exciting pampered life is, hmm.  At one point she takes time out from her moping to apply first aid to the infected leg of one of ""her"" Africans.  This is clearly to show the audience that although she is a foreign colonialist exploiter, she's a good foreign colonialist exploiter.  Yes, where would those poor silly Africans be without their benevolent White mother?  Then she meets Robert Redford, who is pretending to be a British pilot. Now, Redford's character is written as an adventurous free-thinker, but Redford, a fair actor on his best day, has neither the class nor the flair to pull it off. As such, his character does not come off as a free thinker, but rather as a self-absorbed twit. Anyway, they have an affair. Now, when her husband had an affair that was bad, but apparently when Meryl ""Who needs warmth when you have technique"" Streep has one, its good. Still, you just know a happy ending is in sight, and that Streep will come to appreciate her rich, exciting, pampered life. If it all seems irrelevent because the heroine is not the least bit sympathetic, that's because it is.

68170,A1N4IAZJAMIADY,0783240171,Ein Kunde,"[2, 8]","&quot;Out of Africa&quot; has lots to admire; clearly director Sydney Pollack knows what he's doing, and the acting of Meryl Streep, as Karen Blixen, and Klaus Maria Brandauer, as her husband, is excellent. The African landscape is beautifully rendered in David Watkin's cinematography and complimented by John Barry's music. Kenya's colonial past is well evoked in this production. However, on the other hand: Robert Redford is nowhere near believable. Remember he is supposed to be playing Denys Finch Hatton, someone who was born and raised in England and educated at Eton and Oxford. Compared to Streep's efforts Redford seems to be just walking through this role. As it becomes clear that Finch Hatton and Blixen have different ideas about what course their relationship should take, some of the dialogue between their characters is very hard to take, falling just short of laughably ridiculous. Finally, it's hard for a thinking person not to see &quot;Out of Africa&quot; as an apology for European colonization of Africa. Like the way the romance and nostalgia of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; quickly whither when you stop to think that it is the harsh reality of slavery that makes possible the good life at Tara, so it is with Blixen's farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills. Her comforts come at the price of dispossessed Kikuyu, who work as laborers on land they once owned. True, Blixen gave &quot;her&quot; Kikuyu some medicine, and she gave &quot;her&quot; Kikuyu children a school (i.e., a shack that would fit between the couches in her living room), which is probably more than other European settlers did. But is it right that she should refer to any people as &quot;her&quot; Africans? It's impossible to get around the fact that in colonial times the Europeans took the Africans' land, crowded them into designated areas, and exploited their labor.

There are also old photographs of Karen Blixen, the other major characters (mostly of Dennys and the people who worked on her farm), and the farm.

Years later I borrowed the movie from a friend and watched it enough times that it seemed important to get my own copy. DVDs are so much better than VHS. There is a melanchology undertone throughout the movie as Karen struggles to fit into society with her title, personal existence through her possessions, and later with lonliness by not having a partner. Redford likes his freedom though is drawn to Karen through her half acceptance of his absense which is confirm at the end of the movie.

You would think that for a ""Special Collector's Edition"" they would have at least have bothered to clean up the static spots and stabilize the color palette, but I guess not.  This film richly deserves to have the Criterion Collection treatment; it's that beautiful.Twenty years ago, when HBO was a novelty, I must have seen this film ten or fifteen times in one summer.  I was seventeen and had just had my first (and best) taste of true love.  Then life got busy, two decades went by, and I hadn't seen it since then.I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the reviewer who said that this film didn't ""hold up"" to the test of time.  After buying it anyway and hitting ""play"" with the fear that I would find it very disappointing all these years later, I am happy to report that it does indeed ""hold up,"" and that that reviewer must have been watching something else.  Maybe they accidently shipped a DVD of ""Gigli"" in his ""Out of Africa"" box.I am a fervent lover of beautiful film, and quite frankly this one ranks up in the top thirty most beautiful (mainstream) films of all time.  It is absolutely the most gorgeous, ravishing feast of romanticism.  It is also stunning in its visual grandeur and subtle perfection - in short, ""Out of Africa"" is a timeless masterpiece.Now, there is no question that it does not stray far from the classic conventions of the tearjerker romance.  However, sticking to the conventions is forgiveable when they are executed as masterfully as they are here.  Quite frankly, if this film does not wrench the emotion out of you, you need to squeeze your wrist and check for a pulse.Meryl Streep delivers the performance of a lifetime, director Sydney Pollack really outdoes himself, Robert Redford is perfectly cast as the commitment-phobic big game hunter, and the magnificent score soars over it all like Dennis' biplane over the Serengeti.Beyond the heart-wrenching love story itself, this film is the most stupendous and incredible glimpse at everything that is worth loving and saving about Africa's unspoiled places.And in addition even to this, the film is also a look into an aesthetically magnificent time.  The first decades of the 20th century were the last time in human history that people were surrounded by things that were actually real (since I don't count plastic, vinyl, formica and pressboard objects made by robots as ""real."")  Everywhere Karen Blixen moves in this film, she is surrounded by rich woods, rough-hewn stone, solid metals, lead crystal, glazed china and gleaming silver.  Everything is hand-made by craftsmen, and because of this her surroundings are so much more visually interesting and downright beautiful than anything in our normal experience today.  The aesthetic of this film offers a richness that must be seen to be believed.  Every shot in her house is like a page from ""Town and Country - Africa.""Enjoy.",4,One of the greatest screen romances ever,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2959,"['First', 'fifth', 'star', 'withheld', 'only', 'cut-rate', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'would', 'think', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'have', 'bothered', 'clean', 'up', 'static', 'spots', 'stabilize', 'color', 'palette', 'guess', 'not', 'film', 'richly', 'have', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'treatment', 'beautiful.Twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'HBO', 'was', 'novelty', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'times', 'one', 'summer', 'was', 'seventeen', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'first', 'best', 'taste', 'true', 'love', 'Then', 'life', 'got', 'busy', 'two', 'decades', 'went', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then.I', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'buying', 'anyway', 'hitting', 'play', 'fear', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'disappointing', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'indeed', 'hold', 'up', 'reviewer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'something', 'else', 'Maybe', 'accidently', 'shipped', 'DVD', 'Gigli', 'Out', 'Africa', 'box.I', 'am', 'fervent', 'lover', 'beautiful', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'up', 'top', 'thirty', 'most', 'beautiful', 'mainstream', 'films', 'time', 'absolutely', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'ravishing', 'feast', 'romanticism', 'also', 'stunning', 'visual', 'grandeur', 'subtle', 'perfection', 'short', 'Africa', 'timeless', 'masterpiece.Now', 'question', 'not', 'stray', 'far', 'classic', 'conventions', 'tearjerker', 'romance', 'However', 'sticking', 'conventions', 'forgiveable', 'when', 'are', 'executed', 'as', 'masterfully', 'are', 'here', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'film', 'not', 'wrench', 'emotion', 'need', 'squeeze', 'wrist', 'check', 'pulse.Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'really', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'commitment-phobic', 'big', 'game', 'hunter', 'magnificent', 'score', 'soars', 'Dennis', 'biplane', 'Serengeti.Beyond', 'heart-wrenching', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'most', 'stupendous', 'incredible', 'glimpse', 'everything', 'worth', 'loving', 'saving', 'Africa', 'unspoiled', 'places.And', 'addition', 'even', 'film', 'also', 'look', 'aesthetically', 'magnificent', 'time', 'first', 'decades', '20th', 'century', 'were', 'last', 'time', 'human', 'history', 'people', 'were', 'surrounded', 'things', 'were', 'actually', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'plastic', 'vinyl', 'formica', 'pressboard', 'objects', 'made', 'robots', 'real', 'Everywhere', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'film', 'surrounded', 'rich', 'woods', 'rough-hewn', 'stone', 'solid', 'metals', 'lead', 'crystal', 'glazed', 'china', 'gleaming', 'silver', 'Everything', 'hand-made', 'craftsmen', 'surroundings', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'visually', 'interesting', 'downright', 'beautiful', 'anything', 'normal', 'experience', 'today', 'aesthetic', 'film', 'richness', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'shot', 'house', 'page', 'Town', 'Country', 'Africa', 'Enjoy']",N/A

After I heard her speak I was terrified that I'd have to struggle through Redford's attempts at an accent. Thank you Robert that you had better sense. It's a shame Streep wasn't as smart about it.  I guess she wanted to prove that she could do it and, of course, she could but it's very irritating anyway.  On the 60 inch screen it is a beautiful movie and Streep is ravishingly made up. Looks gorgeous. But, it's a dull, plodding movie for the most part.  I know it won all sorts of awards but it isn't the first time a dull, plodding movie won awards.

68204,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,0783240171,J. Michael Click,"[35, 38]","The most honored movie of 1985, &quot;Out of Africa&quot; is indeed an outstanding cinematic achievement. It works on every level imaginable: as an historical epic; as an adventure; as a biography; as a poignant romance.  The film's success is partly attributable to many fine elements which  blend together seamlessly: its script, direction, sets, cinematography,  performances, and editing are each masterful accomplishments.These  individual virtues are given synergy by two outstanding achievements that  together form the movie's backbone and provide its true heart and soul. One  is the sensitive performance of the radiant Meryl Streep, who dominates  both in terms of screen time and charisma; the other is the exquisite,  majestic score by John Barry.  Actor and composer complement each other  perfectly. The famous flying sequence in which his music underscores the  emotions flashing across her face is a superb example of cinema at its  best: it invites the viewer's spirit to soar.Happily, the DVD  presentation of this gem is a treasure in itself. The video transfer is  sharp and clear, with a fairly subtle transition between the dual-layers of  the disc, and the sound is well-balanced and crisp, a definite improvement  over the LaserDisc and VHS releases.  There are fantastic extras offered on  the DVD, including the advance theatrical trailer and a director's audio  commentary. I especially enjoyed the documentary on the making of the film,  which featured recent interviews with Streep, Barry, and director Sydney  Pollack, intercut with behind-the-scenes footage taken during filming.

It's a complex wine that's getting better with age.I saw this movie the year it came out. I was young and remember being bothered by a few technical problems with its green screen effects (which are seldom--it's not that kind of movie).

Watching it again on Blu-ray last night was almost like seeing it for the first time. I won't bore you with a plot summary you can find in other reviews here. Again I was impressed by the magnificent photography and the sweeping score. Meryl Streep was outstanding and I swear she won an Oscar here but only a nomination. I recall grumbling that Robert Redford wasn't convincing as an Englishman and still feel that way. However his performance is the height of romantic charm and heroic bravado both performed in an understated manner that more than makes up for his lack of an English accent. We men should all look that handsome. 'Out of Africa' is a long, long film rich in detail that never drags due to the scenery, dialogue, and performances.There have been mixed reviews here about this 25th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo.  Some feel the video transfer is bad; others like it. I didn't think the Blu-ray was as bad as some of you state or even bad. My player is a LG BD 620 which I reviewed favorably here, that feeds into a Panasonic 42"" Viera, a highly recommended TV. Keep in mind that older films transferred to Blu-ray don't look as good as recent films shot in HD. There are pros & cons about digital tinkering and it depends how much money is spent to create a proper restoration in HD needed for a good transfer. I thought this transfer was reasonably good but not great. Some scenes, especially the night ones, looked better than others as I don't recall any that made me say 'Ugh!' and a few actually made me say 'Ahh!'  I watched bits of the DVD version for comparison and the Blu-ray is a noticeable improvement.The soundtrack is a different matter. There were times when it was difficult to understand foreign accents or soft voices so we played it with subtitles. I also find this happening with many films on discs. Have others notice this problem? I don't understand how the sound mixers who work on these discs don't hear what we hear at home. In fairness to them, this might be due to the original mix recorded with bad microphone positioning that can't be easily improved since I recall this listening issue while in the theater, occasionally elbowing my wife to ask: ""What did they sayyy??""  Since I hate constantly replaying parts or raising the volume to make out what's being said and then have to immediately lower it when the music or sound effects blast the room. I settled for a comfortable volume level while running the subtitles as a compromise for this film and others. The digital audio is OK and doesn't seem to be reworked from the original soundtrack for better surround effects.The video quality is acceptable to me and until a better transfer comes along, I would recommend this version for which I paid $6.88 at Big Lots. One extra worth owning is a documentary about the real Karen Blixen and the making of the film.",4,"This Blu-ray is good, not great.",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2979,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'few', 'parts', 'stuck', 'memory', 'Watching', 'again', 'Blu-ray', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'almost', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'plot', 'summary', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'Again', 'was', 'impressed', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'sweeping', 'score', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'outstanding', 'swear', 'won', 'Oscar', 'here', 'only', 'nomination', 'recall', 'grumbling', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'Englishman', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'However', 'performance', 'height', 'romantic', 'charm', 'heroic', 'bravado', 'performed', 'understated', 'manner', 'more', 'up', 'lack', 'English', 'accent', 'men', 'should', 'look', 'handsome', ""'Out"", 'Africa', 'long', 'long', 'film', 'rich', 'detail', 'never', 'drags', 'due', 'scenery', 'dialogue', 'performances.There', 'have', 'been', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'here', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'combo', 'feel', 'video', 'transfer', 'bad', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'state', 'even', 'bad', 'player', 'LG', 'BD', '620', 'reviewed', 'favorably', 'here', 'Panasonic', '42', 'Viera', 'highly', 'recommended', 'TV', 'Keep', 'mind', 'older', 'films', 'transferred', 'Blu-ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'good', 'recent', 'films', 'shot', 'HD', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'digital', 'tinkering', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'spent', 'create', 'proper', 'restoration', 'HD', 'needed', 'good', 'transfer', 'thought', 'transfer', 'was', 'reasonably', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'scenes', 'especially', 'night', 'ones', 'looked', 'better', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'made', 'say', ""'Ugh"", 'few', 'actually', 'made', 'say', ""'Ahh"", 'watched', 'bits', 'DVD', 'version', 'comparison', 'Blu-ray', 'noticeable', 'improvement.The', 'soundtrack', 'different', 'matter', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'foreign', 'accents', 'soft', 'voices', 'played', 'subtitles', 'also', 'find', 'happening', 'many', 'films', 'discs', 'Have', 'others', 'notice', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'sound', 'mixers', 'who', 'work', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'hear', 'home', 'fairness', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'original', 'mix', 'recorded', 'bad', 'microphone', 'positioning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easily', 'improved', 'recall', 'listening', 'issue', 'theater', 'occasionally', 'elbowing', 'wife', 'ask', 'What', 'did', 'sayyy', 'hate', 'constantly', 'replaying', 'parts', 'raising', 'volume', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'then', 'have', 'immediately', 'lower', 'when', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'blast', 'room', 'settled', 'comfortable', 'volume', 'level', 'running', 'subtitles', 'compromise', 'film', 'others', 'digital', 'audio', 'OK', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'reworked', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'better', 'surround', 'effects.The', 'video', 'quality', 'acceptable', 'better', 'transfer', 'along', 'would', 'recommend', 'version', 'paid', '6.88', 'Big', 'Lots', 'One', 'extra', 'worth', 'owning', 'documentary', 'real', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'making', 'film']",N/A

The movie was based on a compilation of Dinesen's letters and her book which is also called ""Out of Africa"". I was very surprised to find the movie to be a rather marvelous romantic and heartbreaking snapshot of the years that Karen Blixen spent in Africa. Streep couldn't have done a better job.  I highly recommend this movie and that you also invest some time to read Isak Dinesen's book called ""Letters from Africa"" upon which much of the movie is based. You'll see how closely Merly Streep captures the atmosphere, cadence, and tone of Karen Blixen's writing in her speech. For those of you who have never read Dinesen, much of the pleasure in reading her work comes from the conversational nature of her writing. It's almost as if she's speaking to you as you read and you can hear the intonations in your mind as if they were written on the page.  I say this based on having read her work prior to seeing the movie. Thus, while I've never been much of a fan of Streep - I can't think of anyone who I would have preferred in the role now that I've seen her in it.

It stops and starts in graceful arabeqsues and half turns, disappearing into discordance from time to time, then suddenly reappearing, like a flash of rainbow, over the serengeti.You can almost imagine tthe sharp, hygienic stillness of the animals massed under the sun at high noon, and then you can hear them splashing playfully in the frothy high waters while celebrating birth, life, death, the brutal facts they revel in.  All the while in another corner of the screen Meryl Streep is intoning, in a difficult accent, the drama of possession, ""I had a farm in Africa.""  For many of us who grew up in the 1980s, this movie is the most romantic ever made, and John Barry's amazing score ranks as high as Jerome Moross' similarly flamboyant score for THE BIG COUNTRY.  Robert Redford never looked as tall as he did playing Denys Finch Hatton, the reckless adventurer who brokers safaris for heartlessly callous European and American parties, men and women who don't seem to care that they're trampling across the lives and rights of the native people.  In this way, Finch Hatton is implicated in the continued oppression of the indigenous population, and this of course complicates his relationship to Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep), a shadowy affair of deeply submerged desires and the domain of the senses versus the intellect.He knows how to think of a story, but she can out trump him by continuing it, picking yuo the strands of story elements both said and unsaid, and riding them triumphantly like a witch on a broomstick.  There's something magical about her storytelling talent, that puts him in awe, and yet she's an ordinary woman in another sense, and when she falls in love, it not only empowers her but it makes her vulnerable.  Rather it increases her vulnerability, for no matter how blithely she strides around the plantation, she's still very much a stranger in a strange land, far from her native Scandinavian, and plus she has syphilis contracted from a husband she doesn't even care enough about to think of him as a beast.  It's all very sad, and when Redford offers to wash her hair, this simple moment becomes an allegory for the way in which two strangers can meet and purify each other with questions, answers, and a simple pitcher of cool Serengeti water.",5,Sydney Pollack's Best Film,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,2380,"['John', 'Barry', 'thundering', 'score', 'flight', 'brightly', 'colored', 'parrots', 'Kenyan', 'jungle', 'graceful', 'arabeqsues', 'half', 'turns', 'disappearing', 'discordance', 'time', 'time', 'then', 'suddenly', 'reappearing', 'flash', 'rainbow', 'serengeti.You', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'tthe', 'sharp', 'hygienic', 'stillness', 'animals', 'massed', 'sun', 'high', 'noon', 'then', 'can', 'hear', 'splashing', 'playfully', 'frothy', 'high', 'waters', 'celebrating', 'birth', 'life', 'death', 'brutal', 'facts', 'revel', 'while', 'corner', 'screen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'intoning', 'difficult', 'accent', 'drama', 'possession', 'had', 'farm', 'Africa', 'many', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '1980s', 'movie', 'most', 'romantic', 'ever', 'made', 'John', 'Barry', 'amazing', 'score', 'ranks', 'as', 'high', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'similarly', 'flamboyant', 'score', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'never', 'looked', 'as', 'tall', 'did', 'playing', 'Denys', 'Finch', 'Hatton', 'reckless', 'adventurer', 'who', 'brokers', 'safaris', 'heartlessly', 'callous', 'European', 'American', 'parties', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', ""'re"", 'trampling', 'lives', 'rights', 'native', 'people', 'way', 'Finch', 'Hatton', 'implicated', 'continued', 'oppression', 'indigenous', 'population', 'course', 'relationship', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'shadowy', 'affair', 'deeply', 'submerged', 'desires', 'domain', 'senses', 'versus', 'intellect.He', 'how', 'think', 'story', 'can', 'out', 'trump', 'continuing', 'picking', 'strands', 'story', 'elements', 'said', 'unsaid', 'riding', 'triumphantly', 'witch', 'broomstick', 'something', 'magical', 'storytelling', 'talent', 'awe', 'yet', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'sense', 'when', 'love', 'not', 'only', 'vulnerable', 'vulnerability', 'matter', 'how', 'blithely', 'plantation', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'far', 'native', 'Scandinavian', 'syphilis', 'contracted', 'husband', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'enough', 'think', 'beast', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'Redford', 'wash', 'hair', 'simple', 'moment', 'allegory', 'way', 'two', 'strangers', 'can', 'meet', 'purify', 'other', 'questions', 'answers', 'simple', 'pitcher', 'cool', 'Serengeti', 'water']",N/A

68225,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0783240171,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","I saw this film when it first came out in 1985.  It was a romance set in Africa and starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.  At the time, I thought it was two long and couldn't understand how it won seven academy awards.  Well, time marches on.  I read &quot;Out of Africa&quot; and &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot; just a few weeks ago and loved them, and knew that I had to see the video through fresh eyes.  When I saw that it would be a full two hours and 41 minutes, I must say I was a little put off.  I've been known to fall asleep during boring videos.  But I decided to take a chance. I sure was in for a surprise, because not only did I stay awake throughout, I also enjoyed it completely.The film is based on several works of Karen Blixen, who wrote under the pen name of Isak Dinesen after she returned to Denmark from Kenya in the 1930s.  In Africa, she had a loveless marriage to a cousin, a coffee farm that failed, and lived through  WW1 there and the resultant changes it brought.  In the book she didn't go into any detail about her relationship with the  Robert Redford character, Denys, except to talk about how he stayed at her house and the way he loved hunting and flying a plane.  It was in her other writings that she described their romance, which is the focus of the film.Meryl Streep is a fine actress and was excellent in the role, and the director, Sydney Pollack did a wonderful job of evoking the essence of the Africa that Karen Blixen knew.  Robert  Redford is a good looking man, but he can't do an English accent or stop being Robert Redford, and I never really understood what made him tick.  The film was more than just about their romance though.  It was about Ms. Blixen's romance with Africa and that is where the beauty came in.  I recently read a book entitled &quot;Rules of the Wild&quot; by Francesca Marciano, about modern white Kenyans, and how they romanticize Ms. Blixen's experiences, watching the video &quot;Out of Africa&quot; over and over and deploring that the farm that was so dear to her heart is now a shopping mall.It's too bad this film didn't go into more detail about the Africans as there was a lot in the book that could have been included.  But the Hollywood writer opted for the romance between Streep and Redford instead.  I let myself relax though, enjoying the film for what it was, letting myself learn about her relationships with the men in her life, which were only hinted at in the book.  Quickly, I found myself identifying with her as a woman.  And I now well understand why the film was such a success.  It brought me right into a world that doesn't exist any more.  And let me experience the person that was Karen Blixen.  I therefore do recommend this video.  It might be long, but it needed all this time to tell its story.  Coming from me, that's a big compliment.",5,The romance with Africa as well as the romance with the man,1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,2848,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'was', 'romance', 'set', 'Africa', 'starred', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'two', 'long', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'won', 'seven', 'academy', 'awards', 'Well', 'time', 'marches', 'read', 'quot', 'Out', 'Africa', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shadows', 'Grass', 'quot', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'loved', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'video', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'When', 'saw', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'two', 'hours', '41', 'minutes', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'put', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'fall', 'asleep', 'boring', 'videos', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'sure', 'was', 'surprise', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'stay', 'awake', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'completely.The', 'film', 'based', 'several', 'works', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'who', 'wrote', 'pen', 'name', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'returned', 'Denmark', 'Kenya', '1930s', 'Africa', 'had', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'cousin', 'coffee', 'farm', 'failed', 'lived', 'WW1', 'resultant', 'brought', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'Denys', 'talk', 'how', 'stayed', 'house', 'way', 'loved', 'hunting', 'flying', 'plane', 'was', 'other', 'writings', 'described', 'romance', 'focus', 'film.Meryl', 'Streep', 'fine', 'actress', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'evoking', 'essence', 'Africa', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'knew', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'English', 'accent', 'stop', 'being', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'romance', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Blixen', 'romance', 'Africa', 'where', 'beauty', 'came', 'recently', 'read', 'book', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Rules', 'Wild', 'quot', 'Francesca', 'Marciano', 'modern', 'white', 'Kenyans', 'how', 'romanticize', 'Ms.', 'Blixen', 'experiences', 'watching', 'video', 'quot', 'Out', 'Africa', 'quot', 'deploring', 'farm', 'was', 'so', 'dear', 'heart', 'now', 'shopping', 'mall.It', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'Africans', 'was', 'lot', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'opted', 'romance', 'Streep', 'Redford', 'instead', 'let', 'relax', 'enjoying', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'letting', 'learn', 'relationships', 'men', 'life', 'were', 'only', 'hinted', 'book', 'Quickly', 'found', 'identifying', 'woman', 'now', 'well', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'success', 'brought', 'right', 'world', ""n't"", 'exist', 'more', 'let', 'experience', 'person', 'was', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'therefore', 'do', 'recommend', 'video', 'might', 'be', 'long', 'needed', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'Coming', 'big', 'compliment']",N/A
68226,A2441CXD8TXS0R,0783240171,Lloyd A. Conway,"[4, 4]","Isak Diensen's life story became the source of her two well-known memoirs of her years in Africa:  &quot;Out of Africa,&quot; and &quot;Shadows on the Grass.&quot; This movie is (obviously) based on the former.  The  setting is primarily in Kenya, where the Danish Baroness (by marriage)  Blixen moves with her friend-turned-husband, the Swede Bror Blixen.  He is  tempermentally unsuited to the life of a gentleman farmer, and ceases to be  husband, in all but name, while remaining a friend.  The story focuses on  the growing love of the Baroness Karen Blixen for a free spirited  Englishman, Denys Finch-Hutton, a hunter and backwoodsman.  The epic sweep  of the movie carries them through the war years, and into a society that  dosen't quite return to normalcy afterward.  Years after their initial,  rather tense meeting, they become lovers.  The movie is brilliantly filmed,  lucious in its' depiction of the wild places of Africa.  The score is  haunting and melodic.  Meryl Streep, as Baroness Blixen, is magnificant.  Robert Redford, as Finch-Hutton, is very good, but clearly himself - not so  much an English adventurer as Robert as he would have been, had he lived  then.  still, that's no knock on a good performance.  The supporting cast  do very well, with some flavor for backwater colonial nobility and native  Kukuyu simplicity and dignity showing through.  The movie, one I've watched  a number of times, does not satisfy, in one regard:  There are several  olaces where you are led along, expecting something climatcic or memorable  to happen, without it occuring.  There are also lines spoken by characters  that you know are meant to be profound, but somehow they just don't come  off.  Nonetheless, one of the better movies you'll ever see. -Lloyd A.

68230,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,0783240171,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[2, 2]","This movie about Karen Blixen's (Meryl Streep) experiences in Africa and her love affair with Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford) is played out against a lush background, the savage brutality of place rendered in stunning cinematography. The film is a visual feast, capturing the deserts and rolling green valleys, the vast, empty plains and the native population that Blixen befriends and treasures. Her marriage to a German (Klaus Maria Brandaur) a sham, Karen's husband leaves the farm entirely to her, ""we navigated differently... the earth was made round so that we not see too far down the road"". In this stunning landscape, Karen finds her authentic self, burdened with a physical battle with disease, thanks to her husband, perhaps more appreciative of Kenya after her recovery in her native Denmark.Newly returned to Africa, Karen has a fresh perspective on this larger-than-life continent and begins an affair with Denys Finch Hatton, an English adventurer with great respect for the land and its people; but he has very strong opinions about ownership, as he explains constantly to the woman who will eventually demand ownership through marriage. The love affair is epic in this setting, the couple inspired by the grandeur of the land. Everywhere they meet, Africa outshines even the most intense passion, truly the star of this movie. This place is made for life and death struggles and great romances. Karen reaches out to the children on her farm, requiring all of them to attend school. Denys chides her for this endeavor, suggesting she is trying to make little English boys out of the black youth.Even the idyllic romance eventually goes off course, a clash between Denys' commitment to his freedom and Karen's desperate need to have someone of her own. While the acting is low key and Redford's English accent less than convincing, he manages to convey to Karen that ""we do not own the land. We are just passing through."" Whatever intensity is lacking between Streep and Redford, the scenery and score easily make up for their deficiencies. To view this movie now, twenty years later, when the land has been so ravaged by war and poverty is a powerful experience. In this film, Africa is the star.

Undeniably, it is Meryl Streep who holds the film together, as the supporting cast does her no favors. The direction is superb and the background score is very captivating. Universals' DVD presentation of the film is commendable, complete with an hour long documentary called 'The Song of Africa' which documents the crews' travails in the dark continent and also gives one some insights on how the film made it from page to screen.However, Robert Redford ruins most of the film with his dull uninspired take as a British expatriate living and trekking in South Africa. I have never particularly liked any of this mans' performances, and his role here only serves to reiterate that he is one of the most overrated American actors of all time. I can even imagine Tim Curry or Danny DeVito doing a better job here than he does. His character is supposed to be British. Why on earth does he then sound as if he just stepped off a trailer in Mobile, Alabama? Did Mr. Redford do no research on this part?

68237,A129YBX5BVNW2,0783240171,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[6, 6]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY 'COLLECTOR'S SERIES' BOOK PACK VERSION ***In April 2012 Universal Studios was 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie-making centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given US re-launches across the year each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" gatefold card-wrap packaging - and in some cases a host of new features. 1985's ""Out Of Africa"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and like the other BLU RAYS in this series so far - the print is extraordinary and the presentation classy.US-only released 6 March 2012 on Universal 61121058 (no UK issue as yet) - ""Out Of Africa Collector's Series"" comes in a gorgeous limited edition 44-page hardback 'Book Pack' (Barcode 025192127793). It's a 2-disc set with the BLU RAY to the front and the Anamorphic Widescreen DVD to the rear. There's also a foldout insert included that has a code for a Digital Copy via download from Universal's website valid until 31 December 2013. But the really great news for film fans everywhere is a stupendously good print and a REGION FREE release - so it will play on ALL BLU RAY machines and PlayStation 3 Consoles too.[Note: there is a cheaper standard packaging version due 4 September 2012 in the USA with slightly altered front artwork - again it has a BLU Ray, DVD and Download - so check which version you're buying].PICTURE QUALITY:Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results have already received huge praise on web sites dedicated to the format. This overhauled 2012 ""Out Of Africa"" print is a full 1080p High Definition release with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. What that means is the picture fills your entire screen without stretching - and combined with the gorgeous transfer - the effect is truly cinematic. For example the movie opens with a sunrise on the African Plains - all yellows and gold and browns. With the natural heat haze the land would produce and the semi-lighting conditions - this is a very difficult moment to get right - yet it is fantastically clear and clean. But even this is aced a few moments later when a bi-plane flies over the open plains during the daytime and it's little short of gobsmacking (dialogue from it titles this review). There then follows a scene in Denmark in snowy fields at a shooting party where I swear it looks like Dr. Zhivago (it's that good). In fact it's in these outdoor scenes (of which there are many) that the beautiful 'look' of ""Out Of Africa"" really excels - and it does so right through to the very end when Karen (Streep) bids farewell to her trusty steward Farah (played by Michael Bowens) at the train station.It should be stressed however that it isn't perfect at all times by any means - there is some shocking fuzziness and grain on indoor shots - sequences at night around campfires and tents with Redford. There's a scene where Michael Kitchen as the dapper Englishman Berkeley Cole is talking to Meryl Streep at dinner in her home - the camera cuts to Streep and the print is perfect - but it then flicks back to Kitchen and the shot is suddenly covered in speckles of grain. They were either filmed apart or on two cameras - but the cleaned up print has only made the discrepancy more apparent and not less so.But for the most part this is a joy to look at and at last gives full reign to David Watkin's sumptuous cinematography and Milena Canonero's crafted outfits (aristocratic European fashions alongside the colourful garments of African tribesmen). Throw in John Barry's most magisterial score ever - and as you can imagine - the impact is properly beautiful. A good example of all three occurs when the credits role - a steam train trundles across the wide-open expanses of 1913 Kenya in East Africa as we see the Danish Baroness standing at the back of her carriage in her immaculate outfit - then John Barry's score just nails it as the title of the film goes up onscreen. It's both fabulous to look at and moving too...a rare combination indeed.BOOK PACK:The 44-page booklet inside the hardback outer is pure eye candy as you can imagine. It opens with a 2-page appreciation by film-critic and historian Leonard Maltin, has reproductions of several script pages, US, Polish and East German advert posters, a Cast of Characters, a piece on the political makeup of Kenya at the time - the British to the North and the Germans to the South and essays on the principal leads Streep, Redford, the Composer John Barry and Director Sydney Pollock. There's interesting trivia items dotted throughout the text - for instance Redford initially played the Englishman Denys Hatton with an English accent - but Pollock felt no-one would accept Redford as a Brit so he had him re-record all of the parts in American. Or that during the tender hair-washing scene wild Hippos were in the river nearby and they kill more people than lions if they feel their territory is threatened - so Streep was more scared of them than bullwhipping lions. The quality of the colour photos is top-notch too.EXTRAS:Clocking in a whopping 1 hour and 12 minutes Charles Kiselayk's ""A Song Of Africa"" is a substantial bonus feature that has charming, insightful and witty contributions from Streep, Redford and Pollock - intermixed with archive footage of the young, older and near-death Karen Blixen. It fills out a lot of the gaps as to what happened before and after the films' parameters where she left Africa in 1931 after 17 years - 46-years old, childless, penniless, divorced and broken-hearted. She then wrote over 10 books under the pseudonym Isak Dinesen between 1935 and 1996 and suffered from Syphilis all her life. This extra is also in standard 480p definition - so when you see the washed-out widescreen stock footage - you begin to realize just how astounding the cleaned-up 1080p fullscreen print really is. The only mild irritant is the overly wordy narration where the speaker wants to prove he's Kahlil Gibran every few moments, as he waxes lyrical about the lady's journey. The 15 or so Deleted Scenes (Widescreen and in Standard Definition) come fast and furious - they're very short and although one or two with the Farah character are interesting - you can see why most were cut...CAST:With 16 (count them) Oscar nominations to her name - you can't imagine any other actress ballsy enough to take on such a difficult, wilful and frustrated woman. Yet Streep chews it up. Her accented Karen Blixen is wholly believable - vulnerable, proud, literate, deep, religiously repressed yet wanting to be sensually liberated - and reaching for it with the man she grew to adore and love - the English and debonair African hunter Denys Hatton. This is a big and romantic canvas - and both principals have affection for each other and respect for their various skills - their on-screen chemistry being a lovely thing to see. The scene where Denys takes her up in the bi-plane and flies across the landscape of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, zebras, giraffes and a lake full of birds to show her the real beauty of Africa - is breathtaking and even a little spiritual. Pollock's use of the indigenous tribes is superbly done too. Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Gough, Leslie Phillips, Shane Rimmer and the sorely missed Irish actor Donal McCann as her Doctor - all wonderful. Blink and you'll miss IMAN - David Bowie's wife - nursing the Michael Kitchen character whose contracted black water fever...To sum up - clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes - ""Out Of Africa"" may seem a tad indulgent by today's standards of chop-em-out-fast-and-leave-em-panting blockbusters - but it works precisely because its epic. It was a mammoth undertaking at the time made by maverick people (Pollock worked on the script with Kurt Luedtke for over a year - Pollock sadly passed away in 2008) and this BLU RAY reissue does it proud. And as with the other titles in this series - it's also heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of their movie legacy and be proud about doing so too. I'm collecting the whole series and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.Recommended like a cold Pims on the Colonial veranda with a dishy memsahib...old boy.BLU RAY and DVD Specifications:EXTRAS:1.

The movie is 2 hrs 40 minutes long, and you can easily cut an hour from this and not miss *a thing*. This comes dangerously close to making all those nifty exterior shots of wildlife and sunsets wear out their welcome. Worse, the film crawls at a snail's pace. I have no problems with slow pacing if the feel of the film justify it (ie: most of Kubrick's and Ridley Scott's works) but there's no good reason to employ such lethargy here.2 hours into this, the dvd started skipping like mad (a complaint other reviewers have lamented, though I got this via NetFlix so I'll blame them.) However, I used that as an excuse to walk away from the movie for a while, and never really had a desire to get back to it. I eventually did (a few days later) but was consciously aware I was watching the rest of this just to get it over with.This isn't a BAD film, but I don't think it's worthy of the ""best picture"" Oscar it won, either.",3,"very mixed bag: visually beautiful, painfully boring",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,1321,"['true', 'story', 'self-empowered', 'woman', 'struggles', 'setting', 'up', 'plantation', 'Africa', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'way.On', 'bright', 'side', 'sets', 'locations', 'film', 'were', 'magnificent', 'period', 'was', 'well-executed.UNFORTUNATELY', 'very', 'little', 'actually', 'film', 'got', 'sense', 'lot', 'cinematography', 'was', 'padding', 'try', 'distract', 'fact', 'movie', '2', 'hrs', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'can', 'easily', 'cut', 'hour', 'not', 'miss', '*a', 'thing*', 'dangerously', 'close', 'making', 'nifty', 'exterior', 'shots', 'wildlife', 'sunsets', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'Worse', 'film', 'crawls', 'snail', 'pace', 'have', 'problems', 'slow', 'pacing', 'feel', 'film', 'justify', 'ie', 'most', 'Kubrick', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'works', 'good', 'reason', 'employ', 'such', 'lethargy', 'here.2', 'hours', 'dvd', 'started', 'skipping', 'mad', 'complaint', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'lamented', 'got', 'NetFlix', 'so', ""'ll"", 'blame', 'However', 'used', 'excuse', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'while', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'desire', 'get', 'back', 'eventually', 'did', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'consciously', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'rest', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'with.This', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worthy', 'best', 'picture', 'won']",N/A
68241,A2F8R40Z2OMIJM,0783240171,"Matt Howe ""outloud98""","[209, 226]","The transfer of OUT OF AFRICA is gorgeous on this newly released DVD.  The African sun is bright and the detail is crisp -- very important since the scenery is practically a third character in this Oscar-winning &quot;Best  Picture&quot; from 1985.I really enjoyed &quot;Song of Africa&quot;, the  documentary created for this DVD release.  Not mentioned in the DVD's  technical specs, this documentary features several cut scenes not included  in the film (except in a network television showing).  Example: the subplot  of the servant boy with the bad leg whom Karen Blixen heals.  There are a  few Redford-Streep scenes there, too, which ended up on the cutting room  floor (a last dance among Karen Blixen's packed-up home; a made-up story on  safari.)Also, the documentary features incredibly funny and  entertaining tales told by Meryl Streep.  She is a great mimic -- listen to  the sound effects that woman can make!  At times hilarious and reflective,  she shares stories about the making of the film (the story of a tethered  lion she was supposed to whip is particularly funny).  Conspicuously absent  (just like in THE WAY WE WERE DVD) is Mr. Redford's point of view.Also  interesting is screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's tales of the script.  It is  fascinating to learn about the genesis of classic moments.  Wait til you  hear how he came up with the idea of Streep getting her hair washed by  Redford.  (Then listen to Streep's hilarious story of the Hippos in the  river!)  Also revealing is composer John Barry's interview.  His scoring of  Blixen's desert march is interesting -- music can really shape a  scene!OUT OF AFRICA is one of my favorite films.  The widescreen version  on this DVD is a great presentation!  Definitely one for your collection!  Thanks, Universal and Sydney Pollack for putting together a great package.",5,Africa DVD is Gorgeous,951955200,"03 2, 2000",2000,1842,"['transfer', 'OUT', 'OF', 'AFRICA', 'gorgeous', 'newly', 'released', 'DVD', 'African', 'sun', 'bright', 'detail', 'crisp', 'very', 'important', 'scenery', 'practically', 'third', 'character', 'Oscar-winning', 'quot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'quot', '1985.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Song', 'Africa', 'quot', 'documentary', 'created', 'DVD', 'release', 'Not', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'technical', 'specs', 'documentary', 'features', 'several', 'cut', 'scenes', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'network', 'television', 'showing', 'Example', 'subplot', 'servant', 'boy', 'bad', 'leg', 'whom', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'heals', 'are', 'few', 'Redford-Streep', 'scenes', 'there', 'too', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'last', 'dance', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'packed-up', 'home', 'made-up', 'story', 'safari', 'Also', 'documentary', 'features', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'tales', 'told', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'great', 'mimic', 'listen', 'sound', 'effects', 'woman', 'can', 'make', 'times', 'hilarious', 'reflective', 'shares', 'stories', 'making', 'film', 'story', 'tethered', 'lion', 'was', 'supposed', 'whip', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Conspicuously', 'absent', 'just', 'WAY', 'WE', 'WERE', 'DVD', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'point', 'view.Also', 'interesting', 'screenwriter', 'Kurt', 'Luedtke', 'tales', 'script', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'genesis', 'classic', 'moments', 'Wait', 'hear', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'Streep', 'getting', 'hair', 'washed', 'Redford', 'Then', 'Streep', 'hilarious', 'story', 'Hippos', 'river', 'Also', 'revealing', 'composer', 'John', 'Barry', 'interview', 'scoring', 'Blixen', 'desert', 'march', 'interesting', 'music', 'can', 'really', 'shape', 'scene', 'OUT', 'OF', 'AFRICA', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'widescreen', 'version', 'DVD', 'great', 'presentation', 'Definitely', 'one', 'collection', 'Thanks', 'Universal', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'putting', 'together', 'great', 'package']",N/A
68242,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,0783240171,M. Dog,"[7, 8]","This movie puts Isak Dinesen's &quot;Out of Africa&quot; up on the screen, and for my money it is the finest filmed version of a book ever done. The reasons for this do not come from Sydney Pollack's vision of the book being &quot;faithful&quot; exactly (although it is pretty faithful). It is more that he perfectly captured the feel of Dinesen's Africa. The characters in the movie are all based on real people, primarily Isak Denisen (real name Karen Blixen), her husband Bror Blixen, and Denys Finch Hatton. Suffice to say that Meryl Streep, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and Robert Redford all give great performances. In real life both Hatton and Blixen were great white hunters who, despite sleeping with one another's wives and acquaintances, (including aviator Beryl Markham) somehow remained good friends. For me, despite great, intelligent acting from Streep and Brandauer, this is a Robert Redford film. Redford's intense, understated style was never put to better use (Pollack always seemed to know the best use for this actor) and it is a pleasure to watch the way he says so little, but you can see a rich, internal life happening all the time. Plus, it is a kind of kick to see Redford, a staunch conservationist and liberal, playing a great, white hunter in end-of-Empire Africa.

In her book she makes no mention of any romance between herself and Denys Finch-Hatton; there is, however, much information available online to support the love affair shown in the film. This is one of Streep's better performances; she drops  the girlish voice and gestures I dislike in so many of her roles. Streep's &#34;Tania&#34; is the strong, self-reliant and independant Baroness Blixen of the book, and I found her very likeable. Redford is, as always, Redford, and Africa is the star.

It is a beautifully photographed movie; Africa has never looked so lush and lovely.  John Barry's magnificent Oscar winning score just reaffirms this man's incredible genius, who was overlooked for his outstanding James Bond scores.  Meryl Streep as always commands every scene she's in, but even her wonderful portrayal can't obscure the fact that this movie is out and out dull.  While Isak Denisen's tale might intrigue close friends and families, it's a little egocentric to think that her story should have universal appeal.  Except for her interest in the native people, all of her interests are self-serving and focused on her own happiness.  Robert Redford is nothing more than a pretty boy presence whose lack of commitment only reveals how shallow he is.  Klaus Maria Brandauer's opportunistic Baron Blixen is also solely self-serving and ultimately unlikeable.

Meryl Streep and Robert Redford illustrate in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; a sweeping love story set against the backdrop of colonialist turmoil and civil unrest. This is one of those big, BIG character driven melodramas that, for some inexplicable reason, Hollywood has stopped producing. Based on a true story - &quot;Out of Africa&quot; follows the exploits of Karen Blixen (Streep), a headstrong woman who is determined to find adventure and meaning in her life. She allows herself to be swept under by the passion of a notorious womanizer, Baron Finecke (Klaus Maria Brandauer). However, once in Africa, and infected with syphilis by her philandering husband, Karen is left to fend for herself against the violent backdrop of tribal unrest and British colonization. Enter Denys Finch Hadden (Redford), a game hunter with a penchant and a passion for all the things that Karen has dreamed of. The two begin a passionate affair that culminates in tragedy and despair. This is a film of surreal and genuinely haunting beauty coupled with a story that will surely enthrall.Universal Pictures has given us an adequate print of the movie, considerably cleaned up and remastered for DVD. However, there are several occasions where pixelization, edge enhancement and aliasing problems genuinely distract. Colors can seem a bit muddy at times. The cinematography is breathtaking and quite often presented with exceptional clarity and depth. However, there are cases where a soft haze seems to intrude. Black levels are generally solid though here too, occasionally there is an excessive amount of film grain noticed. The soundtrack is 2.0 surround and well represented for its age.

68252,A2VK365XEVCYC8,0783240171,One More Option,"[8, 8]","This is a real love story - with all of love's loneliness, desparations, fragilities, and infinite values.  This movie is like a masterful painting, I want to stare at it and soak it in for long periods of time.  I want to come back and look at it again when time and patience allow.The story uses a repeated device where Karen (the female lead played by Meryl Streep) enjoys telling stories.  Her method of telling a story is to ask the listener to start the story by making up one sentence.  Initially, Robert Redford's character, Denys, starts with a sentence about a foreign woman in a foreign land.  And Karen proceeds to weave an elaborate tale.  The movie fast forwards as they lounge through several rooms until she finishes her storied romance with a telling reveal in front of a fire.Karen learns she has syphilis, given to her by her philandering husband.  She goes away for several months back home to Denmark to have it treated.  After her long time away, she returns to Africa.  Denys asks to take her on a safari.  She resists plainly, ""If you like me at all, don't ask me to do this."" But she yields to his undeniable invitation.  On safari, they spend a great deal of time talking one on one.Karen asks, ""Why am I here?""Denys replies, ""Because I wanted you to see all this . . . I wanted to show it to you.  I thought you'd understand it.""Karen sips her drink, then says, ""I had syphilis . . . That's why I went home.""Denys calmly responds, ""I knew.""""They say I'll have a normal life now.  But no children . . . The school.  The farm.  That's what I am now.""Denys disagrees firmly, ""No.""And THAT, if you are lucky, is what the great loves of your life may change for you.  When you think your world is thoroughly boundaried and defined, and when you think your activities and pursuits have been clearly labeled or assigned, a great love will show you new things you can become that you either always hoped for, or never knew how much you would enjoy.Karen loses her ability to have children, but supported by Denys' ideas and insistent behaviors toward her, she does not lose her abilities to love, to help others, to tell her story, or to create.  His persistence takes her outside her ""homeland"" perceptually, culturally, and role definably.The title to the film, ""Out of Africa,"" is perfect.  The author, whose autobiographical story this film is about, never returned to Africa after her lover left her forever.  And the film suggests you may leave where you have been and never return to that place, but that does not mean that place, or the events that took place there, will ever leave you.On their next evening on safari, talking alone, Denys invites Karen to create another story.  He starts by supplying her one requested sentence, ""There was a young girl from Denmark who took passage on a steamer bound for the Suez.""  And Karen creates the story from his start.I won't give away the ending to this beautiful film, but suffice to say, like most great romances, life throws some complications and tragedies their way.  And one of the themes of this tale is that life may give you a romance that gives you only one great opening sentence.  And sometimes your lover will not stay with you or finish the story with you, and your difficult choice will be whether or not to continue on, whether or not to write almost the entire story on your own.""Only this time I will go ahead.""""It is far?  Where you are going?""""Yes""""You must make this fire very big, so I can find you.""""I was beginning to like your things.  You've ruined it for me, you know?""""Ruined what?""""Being alone.""There is a scene following a character's death in this film where the lover remaining is surrounded by the deceased's beloved collection of books.  Possessions and things often get a bad rap.  They say, ""You can't take them with you.""  But when someone you love disappears forever, you may discover more value in their collected artworks, books, movies, photos, and artfully expressed writings & letters.  Those ""things"" give us some of the only remaining glimpses of their love that gave us reasons to live, to share joy, and to create.",5,"""What matters to me is that you tried so hard.""",1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,4135,"['real', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'loneliness', 'desparations', 'fragilities', 'infinite', 'values', 'movie', 'masterful', 'painting', 'want', 'stare', 'soak', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'look', 'again', 'when', 'time', 'patience', 'allow.The', 'story', 'repeated', 'device', 'where', 'Karen', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'telling', 'stories', 'method', 'telling', 'story', 'ask', 'listener', 'start', 'story', 'making', 'up', 'one', 'sentence', 'Initially', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'Denys', 'sentence', 'foreign', 'woman', 'foreign', 'land', 'Karen', 'proceeds', 'weave', 'elaborate', 'tale', 'movie', 'fast', 'forwards', 'lounge', 'several', 'rooms', 'storied', 'romance', 'telling', 'reveal', 'front', 'fire.Karen', 'syphilis', 'given', 'philandering', 'husband', 'away', 'several', 'months', 'back', 'home', 'Denmark', 'have', 'treated', 'long', 'time', 'away', 'Africa', 'Denys', 'take', 'safari', 'plainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'do', 'undeniable', 'invitation', 'safari', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'talking', 'one', 'one.Karen', 'asks', 'Why', 'am', 'here', 'Denys', 'replies', 'wanted', 'see', 'wanted', 'show', 'thought', ""'d"", 'understand', 'Karen', 'drink', 'then', 'had', 'syphilis', 'why', 'went', 'home', 'Denys', 'calmly', 'responds', 'knew', 'say', ""'ll"", 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'now', 'children', 'school', 'farm', 'what', 'am', 'now', 'Denys', 'firmly', 'No', 'THAT', 'are', 'lucky', 'what', 'great', 'loves', 'life', 'may', 'change', 'When', 'think', 'world', 'thoroughly', 'boundaried', 'defined', 'when', 'think', 'activities', 'pursuits', 'have', 'been', 'clearly', 'labeled', 'assigned', 'great', 'love', 'will', 'show', 'new', 'things', 'can', 'become', 'always', 'hoped', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'enjoy.Karen', 'ability', 'have', 'children', 'supported', 'Denys', 'ideas', 'insistent', 'behaviors', 'not', 'lose', 'abilities', 'love', 'help', 'others', 'tell', 'story', 'create', 'persistence', 'outside', 'homeland', 'perceptually', 'culturally', 'role', 'definably.The', 'title', 'film', 'Africa', 'perfect', 'author', 'autobiographical', 'story', 'film', 'never', 'returned', 'Africa', 'lover', 'left', 'forever', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'never', 'return', 'place', 'not', 'mean', 'place', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'there', 'will', 'ever', 'leave', 'you.On', 'next', 'evening', 'safari', 'talking', 'alone', 'Denys', 'Karen', 'create', 'story', 'supplying', 'one', 'requested', 'sentence', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'Denmark', 'who', 'took', 'passage', 'steamer', 'bound', 'Suez', 'Karen', 'story', 'start.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'film', 'suffice', 'say', 'most', 'great', 'romances', 'life', 'complications', 'tragedies', 'way', 'one', 'themes', 'tale', 'life', 'may', 'give', 'romance', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'opening', 'sentence', 'sometimes', 'lover', 'will', 'not', 'stay', 'finish', 'story', 'difficult', 'choice', 'will', 'be', 'not', 'continue', 'not', 'write', 'almost', 'entire', 'story', 'own', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'go', 'ahead', 'far', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'Yes', 'must', 'make', 'fire', 'very', 'big', 'can', 'find', 'was', 'beginning', 'like', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'know', 'Ruined', 'what', 'Being', 'alone', 'scene', 'following', 'character', 'death', 'film', 'where', 'lover', 'remaining', 'surrounded', 'deceased', 'beloved', 'collection', 'books', 'Possessions', 'things', 'often', 'get', 'bad', 'rap', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'when', 'someone', 'love', 'disappears', 'forever', 'may', 'discover', 'more', 'value', 'collected', 'artworks', 'books', 'movies', 'photos', 'artfully', 'expressed', 'writings', 'letters', 'things', 'give', 'only', 'remaining', 'glimpses', 'love', 'gave', 'reasons', 'live', 'share', 'joy', 'create']",N/A

She is married to the cloddish German baron who is rarely home - he'd prefer being out in the bush playing the great white hunter, and when he does come home, he gives her syphilis. Blixen spends her own money supporting her husband and their plantation while falling in love with the country and with Redford.

The scenes of the countryside, the native tribal structure, the love making between Streep and Redford, and the whole pre-war way of life in Africa are beautifully rendered.This is a winner, one to own and keep and watch over and over.",5,"Sumptuous, romantic, sad, glorious",1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,939,"['Based', 'autobiography', 'Danish', 'writer', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Out', 'Africa', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'photography', 'casting', 'Redford', 'opposite', 'Streep', 'English', 'lover/adventurer', 'married', 'cloddish', 'German', 'baron', 'who', 'rarely', 'home', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'being', 'out', 'bush', 'playing', 'great', 'white', 'hunter', 'when', 'come', 'home', 'syphilis', 'Blixen', 'own', 'money', 'supporting', 'husband', 'plantation', 'falling', 'love', 'country', 'Redford', 'rite', 'passage', 'sorts', 'pressures', 'family', 'duty', 'social', 'convention', 'vie', 'own', 'free', 'passionate', 'spirit', 'scenes', 'countryside', 'native', 'tribal', 'structure', 'love', 'making', 'Streep', 'Redford', 'whole', 'pre-war', 'way', 'life', 'Africa', 'are', 'beautifully', 'rendered.This', 'winner', 'one', 'own', 'keep', 'watch']",N/A

68258,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,0783240171,Phil Berardelli,"[1, 1]","Director Sydney Pollack and screenwriter Kurt Luedtke produced a near-perfect adaptation of the partial autobiography of Karen Blixen (who wrote under the name Isak Dinesin), a Danish baroness who, as she narrates at the beginning of the story, ""had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills,"" in Kenya starting just before World War I. The movie features an array of superlatives, including David Watkin's breathtaking cinematography, especially the 14-shot, opening title montage, which is among the most beautiful ever filmed - and there has probably never been a sunnier or more verdant landscape in the movies. There's also the stunning, 4-minute aerial sequence, as well as John Barry's haunting, painfully melancholy score - his best work of all - and Meryl Streep's incredible performance as Blixen. Streep, who with 13 Oscar nominations to date has earned more than any other actress, is at her very best here, and her performance easily belongs in the Unforgettable category listed later on. She is well-supported by Klaus Maria Brandauer playing her husband (and, briefly, twin brothers), Michael Kitchen as an ill-fated friend, and Malick Bowens as her wise and steady manservant. Robert Redford, working with Pollack for the sixth time, turns in a surprisingly effective performance as Denys Finch Hatton, the love of Karen's life - although he does so by not even attempting a British accent.

Blixen moves from her native Denmark to Kenya to marry and live with the Baron Blixen-Finecke.  At first she is wary and unhappy with her new home, but eventually, she comes to love the land and its people.  Along the way she must deal with her unfaithful and she herself starts a relationship with a dashing Englishman, Denys Finch Hatton.  The romantic relationships are just minor subplots to the film's overall theme of Blixen finding her own place in the world and one that would lead her to become a writer (the film is based on her own book of the same name).  Meryl Streep is winning as Blixen and shows why she is such a great actress.  She is a true chameleon as she adopts a completely credible Danish accent and tone.  No one can mold their voice like Ms. Streep can.  On the flipside, Robert Redford plays Hatton with an English accent that fades in and out.  It's tough to believe him as an Englishmen because he has the quintessential All-American look.  Klaus Maria Brandauer is excellent as the smarmy Baron.  The movie is lushly filmed and the cinematography is in places, breathtaking.  Mr. Pollack uses the grand African Plains to perfection and this helps as the film tends to drag in places.

It is both beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. His costar, Meryl Streep, is an excellent counterpart.

While her husband basically screws around on her she manage the farm and gets it running to a success. She meets Redford's Denys Finch-Hatton and they eventually engage in a love affair.

68263,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0783240171,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[107, 118]","""Out of Africa"" stands out as one of the most spectacular movies ever made. At the 1985 Academy Awards this movie won seven Oscars including Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. It deserved all seven!It is filled with romance, scenery, real-life struggles and the inevitability of fate. It is a journey into Africa and into love. The escape is in the hand of fate. This movie presents Africa as a paradise. The natural environment is harsh, yet unspoiled in this movie.This is based on the true story of Danish writer Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep) who left Denmark to marry German Klaus Maria Brandauer/Baron Bror Blixen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and start a dairy in Kenya.Some women do enjoy the security of a man looking after them, however Karen is different. She seems to desire companionship and offers her fortune in exchange for marriage. Her husband changes his mind about the dairy and instead they use her money on a risky venture to grow coffee. This is not a marriage based on an intense romance, in fact, Karen is marrying her lover's brother.Soon after they arrive in Africa, it becomes apparent this is not a satisfying marriage for Karen. Not only is her husband unfaithful to her, he gives her syphilis. Disease is not the only threat, she also has to fight floods and fire. There are lions which apparently try to attack Karen and Denys although I thought that was pretty unlikely in the situation.I didn't like the ""hunter"" aspects or when the two lions are killed, but if you watch at the end, I think even the lions forgive the hunter. When I've seen lions during the day they were normally napping in the shade. Apparently they had trouble getting the lions to act aggressive and there is information on the DVD explaining these details.Karen finds acceptance in big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford) who loves her ability to tell stories. He starts the stories and she completes them. I think he is impressed by her confidence and creativity. He sees who she really is. Her husband is obviously blind to this beautiful goddess he has taken to Africa.She in turn is delighted by this interest and slowly allows him into her world. While Denys and Karen are a perfect match and as close to soul mates as possible, Denys is unsure of commitment and explains how a piece of paper won't make him love her more. Meryl Streep and Robert Redford have chemistry, chemistry and more chemistry in this movie! They mostly share a few kisses, yet their relationship is on such a deep level, I think it could survive if they just told each other stories.What Karen seems to truly desire is a man who will sacrifice to be with her. She wants to be of value. Denys tells Karen she has confused ""want"" and ""need."" This is an excellent portrayal of the gender differences. Man wants to be free to come and go and woman wants security, love and commitment. She wants to be treated with respect.Denys ""wants"" Karen and Karen seems to ""need"" Denys. The question is not whether he will realize this in time before he loses her, but whether or not fate will turn their lives into a tragedy or allow them to form a true relationship. As Karen says:""When the gods want to punish you, they answer your prayers.""Karen seems the surrender to her fate and is able to experience a brief moment of ecstasy in her life even though she is wounded from the experience.When you view this movie, there are various elements which hint at the ending, yet I didn't recognize them until viewing this the second time. This is a movie I watch every few years because I too once lived on a farm in Africa. It was not quite this romantic because I was still a child. This movie makes me terribly homesick because once we left Africa, we never went back. Africa seems a moment in time, maybe everyone should live there once. When I watch this movie I need a big box of tissues!The best moment in the movie is when Farah asks Karen to build a very big fire so he will know where to find her. It is a moment so beautiful and poetic, I've not seen anything like it in any other movie. I appreciated this movie more now that I'm in my 30s and married than before when I was single and had just returned from Africa myself. This movie is contemplative and deals with complex issues.Spectacular Scenery and Emotionally Satisfying.~The Rebecca Review",5,Beyond this place there be dragons,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,4361,"['Africa', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'spectacular', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', '1985', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'movie', 'won', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Picture', 'deserved', 'seven', 'filled', 'romance', 'scenery', 'real-life', 'struggles', 'inevitability', 'fate', 'journey', 'Africa', 'love', 'escape', 'hand', 'fate', 'movie', 'Africa', 'paradise', 'natural', 'environment', 'harsh', 'yet', 'unspoiled', 'movie.This', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Danish', 'writer', 'Isak', 'Dinesen/Karen', 'Blixen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'left', 'Denmark', 'marry', 'German', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer/Baron', 'Bror', 'Blixen', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'start', 'dairy', 'Kenya.Some', 'women', 'do', 'enjoy', 'security', 'man', 'looking', 'however', 'Karen', 'different', 'desire', 'companionship', 'fortune', 'exchange', 'marriage', 'husband', 'mind', 'dairy', 'instead', 'use', 'money', 'risky', 'venture', 'grow', 'coffee', 'not', 'marriage', 'based', 'intense', 'romance', 'fact', 'Karen', 'marrying', 'lover', 'brother.Soon', 'arrive', 'Africa', 'apparent', 'not', 'satisfying', 'marriage', 'Karen', 'Not', 'only', 'husband', 'unfaithful', 'syphilis', 'Disease', 'not', 'only', 'threat', 'also', 'fight', 'floods', 'fire', 'are', 'lions', 'apparently', 'try', 'attack', 'Karen', 'Denys', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'unlikely', 'situation.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'hunter', 'aspects', 'when', 'two', 'lions', 'are', 'killed', 'watch', 'end', 'think', 'even', 'lions', 'forgive', 'hunter', 'When', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lions', 'day', 'were', 'normally', 'napping', 'shade', 'Apparently', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'lions', 'act', 'aggressive', 'information', 'DVD', 'explaining', 'details.Karen', 'acceptance', 'big', 'game', 'hunter', 'Denys', 'Finch', 'Hatton', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'ability', 'tell', 'stories', 'stories', 'think', 'impressed', 'confidence', 'creativity', 'who', 'really', 'husband', 'obviously', 'blind', 'beautiful', 'goddess', 'taken', 'Africa.She', 'turn', 'delighted', 'interest', 'slowly', 'world', 'Denys', 'Karen', 'are', 'perfect', 'match', 'close', 'soul', 'mates', 'possible', 'Denys', 'unsure', 'commitment', 'how', 'piece', 'paper', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'love', 'more', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'have', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'more', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'mostly', 'share', 'few', 'kisses', 'relationship', 'deep', 'level', 'think', 'could', 'survive', 'just', 'told', 'other', 'stories.What', 'Karen', 'truly', 'desire', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'be', 'be', 'value', 'Denys', 'Karen', 'confused', 'want', 'need', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'gender', 'differences', 'Man', 'be', 'free', 'come', 'go', 'woman', 'security', 'love', 'commitment', 'be', 'treated', 'respect.Denys', 'Karen', 'Karen', 'need', 'Denys', 'question', 'not', 'will', 'realize', 'time', 'not', 'fate', 'will', 'turn', 'lives', 'tragedy', 'allow', 'form', 'true', 'relationship', 'Karen', 'When', 'gods', 'want', 'punish', 'answer', 'prayers', 'Karen', 'surrender', 'fate', 'able', 'experience', 'brief', 'moment', 'ecstasy', 'life', 'even', 'wounded', 'experience.When', 'view', 'movie', 'are', 'various', 'elements', 'hint', 'ending', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'viewing', 'second', 'time', 'movie', 'watch', 'few', 'years', 'too', 'once', 'lived', 'farm', 'Africa', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'romantic', 'was', 'still', 'child', 'movie', 'terribly', 'homesick', 'because', 'left', 'Africa', 'never', 'went', 'back', 'Africa', 'moment', 'time', 'maybe', 'everyone', 'should', 'live', 'once', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'need', 'big', 'box', 'tissues', 'best', 'moment', 'movie', 'when', 'Farah', 'Karen', 'build', 'very', 'big', 'fire', 'will', 'know', 'where', 'find', 'moment', 'so', 'beautiful', 'poetic', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'other', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'more', 'now', ""'m"", '30s', 'married', 'when', 'was', 'single', 'had', 'just', 'returned', 'Africa', 'movie', 'contemplative', 'deals', 'complex', 'issues.Spectacular', 'Scenery', 'Emotionally', 'Satisfying.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

One of the great performances of Meryl Streep, in a career of many great performances.The story of a strong, yet very sensitive woman who follows her husband to Kenya to start a Coffee Plantation. His philandering ways soon leaves her with syphilis. Of course their relationship ends, and she is romanced by the Brit' Denys Finch Hatton, played by Robert Redford minus an ascent. One of the few often heard complaints during the film's release. But their chemistry still makes for one of the great screen romances ever.1985's Best Motion Picture Academy Award winner, a year that saw many superb films. One of my other favorites that year was ""The Color Purple"", either one of which was worthy of the award in my book.

68269,A27HB7WK96IQYA,0783240171,"Robert Bykowski ""Robert Bykowski""","[8, 9]","OK.  First, the positives.  Meryl Streep delivers an unbelievable performance as Danish writer Karen Blixen, who travels to Kenya to be with her unfaithful husband, develops and runs a plantation, and falls in love with an elusive, emotionally distant adventurer (supposedly British).  Meryl is convincingly emotional throughout; her Danish accent is quite good and was obviously perfected through coaching, and her heartbreak by the end of the film at how much she lost certainly tugs at one's heart as well.  Why she did not win the Best Actress Oscar for this performance, possibly her finest ever, is unforgivable.  The other positives are the gorgeous cinematography and wonderful musical score; it sets up quite a visual and audio treat for the eyes and ears.BUT...and this is a large caveat...the story becomes dull and quite ponderous.  Why do we care about these characters ?  What do we learn from them ?  Do the details of their relationship with each other develop and involve us to the point where we really care about what will happen to them ?  I think not. This is the fatal flaw of the film as a whole,and it doesn't help that Robert Redford is horribly miscast as the white hunter Denys who lives life on his own terms. In truth, he was actually  a British man in real life, and Redford doesn't even attempt to affect a British accent or tone but simply portray him as a sort of all-American jock who somehow got waywardly sent to Africa.  A British or Australian actor could have done so much more with this role (imagine Richard Chamberlain or, if he would have been around at the time, Russell Crowe).And the whole plot revolves around not so much as this -- Danish writer follows German husband to Africa; Danish writer ends up running a plantation while German husband is unfaithful.  As a result, Danish writer falls in love with hunter who will not emotionally commit.  Danish writer also catches venereal disease from her unfaithful husband.  And then...well, I won't give away the conclusion.  But to spend two-and-a-half to two-and-three quarters of an hour to develop this rather unexciting story can often find one snoozing or just focusing on the wonderful Meryl or sumptuous photography of Africa accompanied by lovely music in order to stay awake.As you can tell, I have very mixed feelings about 'Out of Africa'.  At the time of its release, I thought it was a masterpiece, but in my opinion, it has not aged well even though the positives it always had remain there.  If the story would remain more emotionally involving, it would be a great film.  As it stands, it is only an interesting but overlong one and the overall effect is rather flat.",3,"Meryl is jaw-dropping, however....",1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,2679,"['OK.', 'First', 'positives', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'unbelievable', 'performance', 'Danish', 'writer', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'who', 'Kenya', 'be', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'develops', 'plantation', 'love', 'elusive', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'adventurer', 'supposedly', 'British', 'Meryl', 'convincingly', 'emotional', 'Danish', 'accent', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'obviously', 'perfected', 'coaching', 'heartbreak', 'end', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'lost', 'certainly', 'tugs', 'one', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'Why', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'possibly', 'finest', 'ever', 'unforgivable', 'other', 'positives', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'score', 'up', 'quite', 'visual', 'audio', 'treat', 'eyes', 'ears.BUT', 'large', 'caveat', 'story', 'dull', 'quite', 'ponderous', 'Why', 'do', 'care', 'characters', 'What', 'do', 'learn', 'Do', 'details', 'relationship', 'other', 'develop', 'involve', 'point', 'where', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'think', 'not', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'film', 'whole', ""n't"", 'help', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'white', 'hunter', 'Denys', 'who', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'truth', 'was', 'actually', 'British', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'Redford', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'affect', 'British', 'accent', 'tone', 'simply', 'portray', 'sort', 'all-American', 'jock', 'who', 'somehow', 'got', 'waywardly', 'sent', 'Africa', 'British', 'Australian', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'role', 'imagine', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'time', 'Russell', 'Crowe', '.And', 'whole', 'plot', 'revolves', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Danish', 'writer', 'German', 'husband', 'Africa', 'Danish', 'writer', 'up', 'running', 'plantation', 'German', 'husband', 'unfaithful', 'result', 'Danish', 'writer', 'love', 'hunter', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'emotionally', 'commit', 'Danish', 'writer', 'also', 'venereal', 'disease', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'then', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'conclusion', 'spend', 'two-and-a-half', 'two-and-three', 'quarters', 'hour', 'develop', 'rather', 'unexciting', 'story', 'can', 'often', 'find', 'one', 'snoozing', 'just', 'focusing', 'wonderful', 'Meryl', 'sumptuous', 'photography', 'Africa', 'accompanied', 'lovely', 'music', 'order', 'stay', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', ""'Out"", 'Africa', 'time', 'release', 'thought', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'opinion', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'even', 'positives', 'always', 'had', 'remain', 'there', 'story', 'would', 'remain', 'more', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'only', 'interesting', 'overlong', 'one', 'overall', 'effect', 'rather', 'flat']",N/A

The movie was a beautiful and poignant glimpse at 1914 Africa and the trials and tribulation of Karen Blixen, ( Meryl Streep) a real life aristocrat bent on adventure in a still wild and savage land.  There, she and her husband, Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer) agree to run a coffee plantation.  Karen actually runs it, while Klaus would rather be out carousing.There she meets Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford) and has an out of wed lock love affair with him.  Denys is a free spirit and refused to be fettered by any woman.There is a fire and they lose their coffee crop, and ultimately the plantation, however, Karen's main concern is for the native tribesman, who would lose their land when it becomes taken over by the Crown.Denys is killed in a plane crash and Karen returns home to Denmark, relieved of her land.The film is moving but the truely great photography really helps to make this an exceptional production.  The last scene where the lions come to rest on Denys' grave, overlooking the the wild african savanna is especially touching.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories, as well as the wilds of early 20th century Africa.",5,A MOVING FILM WITH GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1216,"['many', 'many', 'reviews', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'glimpse', '1914', 'Africa', 'trials', 'tribulation', 'Karen', 'Blixen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'real', 'life', 'aristocrat', 'bent', 'adventure', 'still', 'wild', 'savage', 'land', 'husband', 'Bror', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'agree', 'run', 'coffee', 'plantation', 'Karen', 'actually', 'Klaus', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'out', 'carousing.There', 'Denys', 'Finch', 'Hatton', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'wed', 'lock', 'love', 'affair', 'Denys', 'free', 'spirit', 'refused', 'be', 'fettered', 'fire', 'lose', 'coffee', 'crop', 'ultimately', 'plantation', 'however', 'Karen', 'main', 'concern', 'native', 'tribesman', 'who', 'would', 'lose', 'land', 'when', 'taken', 'over', 'Crown.Denys', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'Karen', 'home', 'Denmark', 'relieved', 'land.The', 'film', 'moving', 'truely', 'great', 'photography', 'really', 'make', 'exceptional', 'production', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'lions', 'come', 'rest', 'Denys', 'grave', 'overlooking', 'wild', 'african', 'savanna', 'especially', 'touching.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'love', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'wilds', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Africa']",N/A

The cinematography is absolutely wonderful.  The music is sublime.  The story, however, has some serious flaws which caused me to enjoy the film less and to take the time to caution you before you spend your hard-earned money for a $50 million travelogue.  Streep is great as always, but Robert Redford's participation in this project throws the whole plot out of balance.  The affair between the Streep and Redford characters is a subplot.  A minor part of the storyline which begins and ends in act two.  Without giving too much away, we don't even see Redford's exit - we're told about it.  The very worst way to do something in a movie.  But because the performer is a major star, suddenly this subplot blows itself all out of proportion and throws the whole story out of kilter.The love story is between Streep's character and Africa.  Redford distracts us from that relationship.  It makes the film seem to be made out of several stories that don't fit together rather than forming a seamless whole.  I left it feeling less-than-engaged with the characters and felt the one redeeming quality was the cinematography - certainly not enough to recommend it to you.

68291,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,0783240171,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""Out Of Africa"" has always been one of my all-time favorite films. Rarely has a movie excelled in all components of the cinema, everything from the acting to the direction to the story. Meryl Streep plays a woman named Karen Blixen who marrys a philandering man in Kenya. Soon, Karen falls in love with both the land and a white hunter, played by Robert Redford. The movie depicts Karen's story on running a coffee plantation, the problems she encounters in running her business, and her love affair with this mysterious man who has stolen her heart. ""Out Of Africa"", based on a true story, swept the 1985 Academy Awards, winning for Best Picture, Best Director for Sydney Pollack, Best Cinematography, Original Score, Art Direction, and Sound. The music to the film is one of the most haunting in film history and adds to the intense drama. Roger Ebert says, ""Out Of Africa"" is one of the great epic romances"". The special edition DVD comes with commentary by Pollack, an original documentary entitled ""Song Of Africa"", the trailer, and production notes. The film is 2 hours and 41 minutes, and the sound is 4.1.

68292,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0783240171,Themis-Athena,"[10, 10]","He often tries to distill his movies' themes into a single word, Sydney Pollack explains on ""Out of Africa""'s DVD.  Here, that word is ""Possession:"" The possessiveness of the colonialists trying to make Africa theirs; to rule her with their law, settle on the local tribes' land, dress their African servants in European outfits (complete with a house boy's white gloves), import prized belongings like crystal to maintain the comforts of European civilization, and teach African children to read, to remove their ""ignorance.""  And the possessiveness of human relationships; the claim of exclusivity arising from a wedding license, the encroachment on personal freedom resulting if such a claim is raised by even one partner - regardless whether based on a legal document - and the implications of desire, jealousy, want and need.As such, the movie's story of Danish writer Karen Blixen's (Isak Dinesen's) experience in Kenya is inextricably intertwined with her love for free-spirited hunter/adventurer Denys Finch Hatton.  Just as she spends years trying to wrangle coffee beans from ground patently unfit for their plantation and create a dam where water that, her servants tell her, ""lives in Mombassa"" needs to flow freely, only to see her efforts fail at last, so also her romance with Finch Hatton blossoms only as long as she is still (pro forma) married, and thus cannot fully claim him.  As soon as the basis of their relationship changes, Finch Hatton withdraws - and is killed in a plane crash shortly thereafter, his death thus cementing a development already underway with terrible finality.  In her eulogy Karen asks God to take back his soul with its freedom intact: ""He was not ours - he was not mine.""  Yet, both Kenya and Finch Hatton leave such a mark on her that, forced to return to Denmark, she literally writes them back into her life; again becoming the ""mental traveler"" she had been before first setting foot on African soil, using her exceptional storytelling powers to resurrect the world and the man she lost, and be united with them in spirit where a more tenable union is no longer possible.While ""Out of Africa"" is an adaptation of Blixen's like-named ode to Kenya, several of her other works also informed the screenplay; as did Judith Thurman's Blixen biography.  And it's this combination which in screenwriter Carl Luedtke' and director Sydney Pollack's hands turns into gold where prior attempts have failed; because Blixen's book is primarily, as Pollack explains, ""a pastorale, a beautifully formed memoir [relying] on her prose style, her sense of poetry and her ability to discover large truths in very small ... details"" but lacking ""much narrative drive"" and thus, ""difficult to translate to film.""  In addition, Blixen was largely silent about her relationship with Finch Hatton, which however was an essential element of the story, thus dooming any attempt to produce a movie without extensive prior research into this area.Meryl Streep was not Sydney Pollack's first choice for the role of Karen, for which luminaries including Greta Garbo and Audrey Hepburn had previously been considered.  Looking back in the DVD's documentary, Streep and Pollack recount how his change of mind came about (and ladies, I just know her version will make you laugh out loud).  But while unfortunately neither her Oscar- nor her Golden-Globe-nomination turned into one of the movie's multiple awards (on Oscar night alone, Best Movie, Best Director and Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Music and Sound), she was indeed the perfect choice.  Few contemporary actresses have her range of talent and sensitivity; and listening to tapes of Blixen reading her own works allowed her not only to develop a Danish accent but to become the story's narrative voice in the completest sense, from Blixen's persona to her perceptions and penmanship.Much has been made of the fact that as Finch Hatton no British actor was cast but Robert Redford, with whom Pollack had previously collaborated in five successful movies, including the mid-1970s' ""The Way We Were"" and ""Three Days of the Condor.""  But as Pollack points out, Finch Hatton, although a real enough person in Karen Blixen's life, in the movie's context stands for the universal type of the charming, ever-unpossessable, mysterious male; and there simply is no living actor whose image matches that type as closely as Redford's.  Indeed, in this respect his character in ""Out of Africa"" epitomizes his ""Redfordness"" more intensely than *any* of his other roles.  Moreover, all references to Finch Hatton's nationality are deleted here; so this isn't Robert Redford trying to portray a member of the English upper class, this is Redford portraying Redford (or at least, his public image) - and therefore, it is only proper that he didn't adopt a British accent, either.Praise for this movie wouldn't be complete without mentioning the splendid, Golden-Globe-winning performance of Klaus-Maria Brandauer, one of today's best German-speaking actors, in the role of Karen's philandering husband Bror.  (And if you think he's duplicitous here, rent such gems as ""Mephisto"" and ""Hanussen"" - or, for that matter, ""James Bond: Never Say Never Again"" - and you'll see what creepy and demonic really is when it's grown up).  And of course, ""Out of Africa"" wouldn't be what it is without its superb African cast members; particularly Malick Bowens as Karen's faithful major domus Farah and Joseph Thiaka in his only known screen appearance as Kamante, Karen's indomitable cook.  Several fine British actors complete the cast, providing enough British colonial feel even for those quibbling with Redford's casting; to name but a few, Michael Kitchen as Finch Hatton's friend Berkeley Cole, Michael Gough as Lord ""Dee"" Delamere and Suzanna Hamilton as Felicity (whose character is based on Blixen's friend and rival for Finch Hatton's attentions, Beryl Markham).In all, ""Out of Africa"" is a grand, lavishly produced tribute to Africa, nature, freedom, adventure and love: Karen Blixen's ""Song of Africa"" brought to the big screen - and one of the profoundest love stories ever written by life itself.Also recommended:Out of Africa and Shadows on the GrassIsak Dinesen:The Life of Karen Blixen, StorytellerWest with the NightThe Flame Trees of ThikaThe Snows of

Risoli ""black farmer""","[0, 0]","It is no wonder there are complaints about the Blu-ray transfer of this 25th Anniversary Blu-ray edition with the Blu-ray on one side and the DVD version on the other side of the same disc.  It's a Universal picture.  This is the studio notorious for putting four films on the same disc of their Hammer franchise or even their original horror monsters along with Ma and Pa Kettle, etc.  For pennies they would sacrifice your hard-earned dollars and do not care how much you complain because they are a very large studio.  The screen during some of the vista of the African countryside are blotchy.  A DVD is more often clearer.""Born Free"" (1965) causes me to cry every time I see it.  ""Out of Africa"" was a long way to go for a downbeat ending.  And as an epic it does not go very far, it is not as involving or even compelling, although it does say some small things rather effectively.  Perhaps I am being too hard on it, as these small things added together have a nice message.  Robert Redford seems a little too old to be playing these romantic parts, Streep is good, but I would never say Jane Fonda did not have the capability to out-act her, at least, by her performance in ""Out of Africa.""  The best thing about ""Out of Africa"" is John Barry's music which augments the stunning cinematography by David Watkin and editing.  Barry's music for ""Out of Africa"" lifts the film out of any mediocrity into any higher achievement it deserves, which is ample as it won Best Picture.  Barry has created many beautiful passages and where one film may have only one central theme song, Barry has created two equally beautiful themes:  the Love Theme (""The Music of Goodbye"") and the Main Theme.  And I guess a studio like Universal doesn't value its own Oscar winner enough to provide exemplary home video of it.  That's the real story.  Don't spend the $6.88 at Big Lots.  It's not worth it to have a piece of junk for your money.  If you can accept the poor Blu-ray version, then one side of this two-sided disc may malfunction.  But then you won't have to throw away a whole set of non-working discs.  But then, don't they deserve it?",3,"Not the Best Blu-ray; I Liked ""Born Free"" Better Anyway",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2134,"['wonder', 'are', 'complaints', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'Blu-ray', 'one', 'side', 'DVD', 'version', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'disc', 'Universal', 'picture', 'studio', 'notorious', 'putting', 'four', 'films', 'same', 'disc', 'Hammer', 'franchise', 'even', 'original', 'horror', 'monsters', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'etc', 'pennies', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'hard-earned', 'dollars', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'how', 'much', 'complain', 'are', 'very', 'large', 'studio', 'screen', 'vista', 'African', 'countryside', 'are', 'blotchy', 'DVD', 'more', 'often', 'clearer', 'Born', 'Free', '1965', 'cry', 'time', 'see', 'Africa', 'was', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'downbeat', 'ending', 'epic', 'not', 'go', 'very', 'far', 'not', 'involving', 'even', 'compelling', 'say', 'small', 'things', 'rather', 'effectively', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'small', 'things', 'added', 'together', 'have', 'nice', 'message', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'romantic', 'parts', 'Streep', 'good', 'would', 'never', 'say', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'capability', 'out-act', 'her', 'least', 'performance', 'Out', 'Africa', 'best', 'thing', 'Out', 'Africa', 'John', 'Barry', 'music', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'David', 'Watkin', 'editing', 'Barry', 'music', 'Out', 'Africa', 'film', 'mediocrity', 'higher', 'achievement', 'ample', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Barry', 'created', 'many', 'beautiful', 'passages', 'where', 'one', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'central', 'theme', 'song', 'Barry', 'created', 'two', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'themes', 'Love', 'Theme', 'Music', 'Goodbye', 'Main', 'Theme', 'guess', 'studio', 'Universal', ""n't"", 'value', 'own', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'enough', 'provide', 'exemplary', 'home', 'video', 'real', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'spend', '6.88', 'Big', 'Lots', 'not', 'worth', 'have', 'piece', 'junk', 'money', 'can', 'accept', 'poor', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'then', 'one', 'side', 'two-sided', 'disc', 'may', 'malfunction', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'throw', 'away', 'whole', 'set', 'non-working', 'discs', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve']",N/A

She followed her heart and regardless of what was thrown her way she handled it with dignity and strength.
