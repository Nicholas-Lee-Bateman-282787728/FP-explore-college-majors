1168840,A2RV78U1G3MGLH,B001AYJ2Y0,Fredrick L. Murphy,"[4, 11]","We watched this film 3 times, the first time we thought it wasn't as good as the book but it was ""okay"" for a filmed version.  One thing comes thru positively clear, and is truthful, and that is that we are on a journey towards God's Kingdom and not everybody will understand or appreciate that!Then we watched it again, and thought...boy, the film really makes the Law (the Holy Torah) look bad!  On our third watching, many months later, we realized that though Hebrews 5 & 6 admonishes us not to dwell on the ""basics & beginnings"" of our faith, that this film is pretty much what Modern Christianity does and dwells on in totality...""the basics and beginnings of faith"" in God and acts of INITIAL obedience towards a person relationship with Him.Also, the whole concept of heading for a ""celestial-city"" is the focus of the film, where you'll be ""happy, joyful, and get a crown, with eternal life.""  Again, those are the beginning basics, but Modern Christianity (in our opinion) focuses on those topics to the UTMOST degree and seminaries take those basics even further by delving into the SAME THINGS thru history, philosophy, geography, and modernity, but never grows beyond these simple things.  Any reading of the whole Bible tells you, from Genesis to Revelation, that the place Believers in the God of Israel will go to be near God and enjoy His presence will be the Promised Covenanted Land of Israel.  Jerusalem is the ultimate place, according to our Bibles, and not some ""unknown, fairy place in the sky"" that we fly away to.  Without going into a sermon here, on what happens once we meet Mashiakh in the air, i think i've given enough of a picture of why we personally got rid of this film and cannot recommend it.  It's rather childish and short-sighted, and often that is dangerous.It's kind of ""flighty,"" and typical of Modern Christian thought, and the depth and wealth of the Torah are completely bypassed, marginalized, and even condemned.  The film pounds people with thoughts of getting to a ""celestial city"" in this film as if it were the goal at the end of life's road (most Modern Christians think this way because of sad watery teachings), and it therefore reeks of the strumming of harps and floating in clouds type-thoughts (tongue-in-cheek).  The Scriptures are clear, that all mankind will exist on the earth and that even a renewed heavens and earth will be created at some point.  The Scriptures are even clearer that all mankind will be required to come up to the Lord of Hosts for things like the Feast of Sukkot, ""New Moons,"" and ""Sabbaths"" in various batches/trips, as THE place we all want to be and THE goal (in being with the Lord).  Modern Christianity has been taught a very light, milk-drinking, semi-truthful (i mean that well...as all of this, i'm not trying to condemning anybody!), and VERY SHORT-SIGHTED view of what happens when we are resurrected or when the End of Days arrives (whichever happens first). The ""Celestial City"" should be Jerusalem, and ultimately the Holy New JERUSALEM with 12 gates for the 12 tribes of Israel, and not some fairy tale thought.  Life will go on...but in a more intended capacity, by the Creator's hand.More than my two cents, but we all say ""don't buy.""",2,"Good for perhaps elementary beginnings, but much Biblical ignorance",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,3238,"['watched', 'film', '3', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'book', 'was', 'okay', 'filmed', 'version', 'One', 'thing', 'thru', 'positively', 'clear', 'truthful', 'are', 'journey', 'God', 'Kingdom', 'not', 'everybody', 'will', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'Then', 'watched', 'again', 'thought', 'boy', 'film', 'really', 'Law', 'Holy', 'Torah', 'look', 'bad', 'third', 'watching', 'many', 'months', 'later', 'realized', 'Hebrews', '5', '6', 'admonishes', 'not', 'dwell', 'basics', 'beginnings', 'faith', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Modern', 'Christianity', 'dwells', 'totality', 'basics', 'beginnings', 'faith', 'God', 'acts', 'INITIAL', 'obedience', 'towards', 'person', 'relationship', 'Him.Also', 'whole', 'concept', 'heading', 'celestial-city', 'focus', 'film', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'joyful', 'get', 'crown', 'eternal', 'life', 'Again', 'are', 'beginning', 'basics', 'Modern', 'Christianity', 'opinion', 'topics', 'UTMOST', 'degree', 'seminaries', 'take', 'basics', 'even', 'further', 'delving', 'SAME', 'THINGS', 'thru', 'history', 'philosophy', 'geography', 'modernity', 'never', 'simple', 'things', 'reading', 'whole', 'Bible', 'tells', 'Genesis', 'Revelation', 'place', 'Believers', 'God', 'Israel', 'will', 'go', 'be', 'God', 'enjoy', 'presence', 'will', 'be', 'Promised', 'Covenanted', 'Land', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'ultimate', 'place', 'according', 'Bibles', 'not', 'unknown', 'fairy', 'place', 'sky', 'fly', 'away', 'going', 'sermon', 'here', 'what', 'once', 'meet', 'Mashiakh', 'air', 'i', 'think', 'i', ""'ve"", 'given', 'enough', 'picture', 'why', 'personally', 'got', 'rid', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'rather', 'childish', 'short-sighted', 'often', 'dangerous.It', 'kind', 'flighty', 'typical', 'Modern', 'Christian', 'thought', 'depth', 'wealth', 'Torah', 'are', 'completely', 'bypassed', 'marginalized', 'even', 'condemned', 'film', 'people', 'thoughts', 'getting', 'celestial', 'city', 'film', 'were', 'goal', 'end', 'life', 'road', 'most', 'Modern', 'Christians', 'think', 'way', 'sad', 'watery', 'teachings', 'therefore', 'strumming', 'harps', 'floating', 'clouds', 'type-thoughts', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Scriptures', 'are', 'clear', 'mankind', 'will', 'exist', 'earth', 'even', 'renewed', 'heavens', 'earth', 'will', 'be', 'created', 'point', 'Scriptures', 'are', 'even', 'clearer', 'mankind', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'come', 'up', 'Lord', 'Hosts', 'things', 'Feast', 'Sukkot', 'New', 'Moons', 'Sabbaths', 'various', 'batches/trips', 'THE', 'place', 'want', 'be', 'THE', 'goal', 'being', 'Lord', 'Modern', 'Christianity', 'been', 'taught', 'very', 'light', 'milk-drinking', 'semi-truthful', 'i', 'mean', 'well', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'condemning', 'anybody', 'VERY', 'SHORT-SIGHTED', 'view', 'what', 'when', 'are', 'resurrected', 'when', 'End', 'Days', 'arrives', 'first', 'Celestial', 'City', 'should', 'be', 'Jerusalem', 'ultimately', 'Holy', 'New', 'JERUSALEM', '12', 'gates', '12', 'tribes', 'Israel', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'thought', 'Life', 'will', 'go', 'more', 'intended', 'capacity', 'Creator', 'hand.More', 'two', 'cents', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",Pilgrim's Progress: Journey to Heaven

1168860,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B001AYJ2Y0,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[3, 3]","John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is an enduring classic.  Its appeal is in the fact that his allegory does not sugarcoat the journey that all of us must embark upon if we are to be saved. This journey is fraught with many dangers, but it is one in which the victory promises great joy.  This modern-day adaptation is truly moving.  The script stays true to Bunyan's book while simultaneously making the language accessible to those who would not read the story.  Purists may not like this film, but I found it to be extrememely inspiring.In the City of Disstruction, a man named Christian is barraged by doubts and fears.  A book that he reads predicts that his city will be destroyed by fire and urges him and his family to escape.  Not only does Christian deal with inward turmoil, but he is crippled by a horrendous burden upon his back that hinders his movements.  A man named Evangelist urges Christian to journey to the Celestial City, a place of refuge where he will escape the coming judgment.  Christian sets forth on his journey, little knowing that many dangerous foes lie in wait.  However, many helpers also wait in the wings to offer their assistance.The acting in this movie was very good.  Certain characters were not portrayed in ways I would have imagined, but the overall effect of the film is excellent.  My favorite scenes were Christian's encounter with Worldly Wise, the trial scene at Vanity Fair, and the journey through the dark river.  Pilgrim's Progress is an entertaining journey that dramatizes our daily struggles with the Evil One and our only hope in our Savior, Jesus Christ.  I pray that more Christian movies in the allegorical/fantasy genre will be made.  God bless you all.(Please look for my allegorical novel entitled Crimilia, which is available on this site.

They represent the people who aid us in our walk with Christ.However, Christian meets many more people and demons who try to redirect him off the path - Ignorance, Vanity, Atheist, and a host of others.  Indeed, for the serious Christian, in our lives we will encounter many more people such as these.  Demons also.The movie lasts around 1 hour and 45 minutes but seems to go quickly.

1168864,A207IYGZTAF0DS,B001AYJ2Y0,NoWireHangers,"[3, 8]","Christian director Danny Carrales (of ""Escape from Hell"", ""Final Exit"" and ""The Gathering"") takes on Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. This is certainly Carrales most ambitious project to date and also his longest film at 105 minutes.I'll be honest and upfront about not having read Bunyan's novel so I can't compare the novel and the film, so this review will focus only on the movie as a standalone work.There are a few good and some bad things about this film. The quality of the different aspects of the movie is uneven, for example acting. I think Daniel Kruse did a pretty good job and Hugh McLean gave a strong performance (as usual in films that are below his abilities, it seems), while some minor roles were really, really bad, and I mean laughably  bad (and I doubt Carrales was going for comedy value). The same is true for the special effects. The first special effects scene was pretty bad but later, there were some special effects scenes that were pretty good.Anyway, those are the minor aspects of a movie, I guess. So let's move on to story and entertainment value. Story: Christian is reading a book. It's given him a great burden (literally - he walks around with the world's largest backpack). He wants to leave his home in  City of Destruction where he lives with his family, to journey to the Celestial City. No one wants to come with him so he goes alone. Along the way he meets various people who guide him on his journey, and some who try to get him off the right path.So what we have is an adventure story, with fantasy elements. Now, adventure sounds exciting, but director-writer Carrales fails to create excitement. He has Christian and his occasional traveling companions walking from one place to the next, meeting one guide after another, and so it goes for a very long time. There's very few obstacles to overcome or many dangers along the way. With nothing exciting happening, it gets quite repetitive to watch and, to be honest, pretty boring.I wouldn't generally recommend this one, except perhaps to those who are fans of the book and want to see what the movie is like.PS: There's is also a 1979 movie from this book with Liam Neeson in his film debut in it:Pilgrim's Progress",2,Ambitious low budget film suffers from dull storytelling,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2210,"['Christian', 'director', 'Danny', 'Carrales', 'Escape', 'Hell', 'Final', 'Exit', 'Gathering', 'Bunyan', 'Pilgrim', 'Progress', 'certainly', 'Carrales', 'most', 'ambitious', 'project', 'date', 'also', 'longest', 'film', '105', 'minutes.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'upfront', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'Bunyan', 'novel', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'novel', 'film', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'only', 'movie', 'standalone', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'quality', 'different', 'aspects', 'movie', 'uneven', 'example', 'acting', 'think', 'Daniel', 'Kruse', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Hugh', 'McLean', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'usual', 'films', 'are', 'abilities', 'minor', 'roles', 'were', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'mean', 'laughably', 'bad', 'doubt', 'Carrales', 'was', 'going', 'comedy', 'value', 'same', 'true', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'special', 'effects', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'later', 'were', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'good.Anyway', 'are', 'minor', 'aspects', 'movie', 'guess', 'So', 'let', 'move', 'story', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Story', 'Christian', 'reading', 'book', 'given', 'great', 'burden', 'literally', 'world', 'largest', 'backpack', 'leave', 'home', 'City', 'Destruction', 'where', 'family', 'journey', 'Celestial', 'City', 'one', 'come', 'so', 'alone', 'way', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'guide', 'journey', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'off', 'right', 'path.So', 'what', 'have', 'adventure', 'story', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'Now', 'adventure', 'exciting', 'director-writer', 'Carrales', 'create', 'excitement', 'Christian', 'occasional', 'traveling', 'companions', 'walking', 'one', 'place', 'next', 'meeting', 'one', 'guide', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'very', 'few', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'many', 'dangers', 'way', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'happening', 'quite', 'repetitive', 'watch', 'be', 'honest', 'pretty', 'boring.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'generally', 'recommend', 'one', 'perhaps', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'book', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'movie', 'like.PS', 'also', '1979', 'movie', 'book', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'film', 'debut', 'Pilgrim', 'Progress']",Pilgrim's Progress: Journey to Heaven
