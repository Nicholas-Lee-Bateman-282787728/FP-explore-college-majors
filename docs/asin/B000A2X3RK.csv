Horrible acting & even worse script.  After watching it the first time, I thought I should have watched it drunk.  Would be much funnier.  Wine colored Onesies.  Tyler yelling all the time.  A Tori Spelling look-a-like.  Watching it drunk made it worse.  I'm giving it 2 stars because of the Onesies.  Maybe you need to be high to laugh at this.  There's having a dry sense of humor & then none.  Deidrich & Chris are funny guys when they have quality stuff to work with.  Just wish they would have.",2,Humor is an Alien Concept,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,591,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'life', 'Horrible', 'acting', 'even', 'worse', 'script', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'drunk', 'Would', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'Wine', 'colored', 'Onesies', 'Tyler', 'yelling', 'time', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'look-a-like', 'Watching', 'made', 'worse', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'Onesies', 'Maybe', 'need', 'be', 'high', 'laugh', 'having', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'then', 'none', 'Deidrich', 'Chris', 'are', 'funny', 'guys', 'when', 'have', 'quality', 'stuff', 'work', 'Just', 'wish', 'would', 'have']",Evil Alien Conquerors

Evarts ""Opinion Emitter""","[1, 1]","The first half of this movie has an occasional laugh, but as several people have said, the jokes are repetitive and it does have a SNL-skit-stretched-out-too-long sort of thing going.  It just seems to be trying too hard to be funny.  I actually turned it off halfway through and almost gave up on it.  Later, I decided since I paid $11 for it, I should finish it.  Then Tyler Labine shows up.  I laughed until my stomach hurt.  The eyebrow women.  The infomercials!  It's like they took all the funny out of the first half and put it in the second half.  Here's my advice:  during the first half, microwave some nachos, drink a couple beers, chat with your friends who can't believe you made them sit through it.  Then when Tyler Labine is unceremoniously dumped onto the Earth, settle in and watch the rest.",4,"Half Bad, Half Really Funny",1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,809,"['first', 'half', 'movie', 'occasional', 'laugh', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'jokes', 'are', 'repetitive', 'have', 'SNL-skit-stretched-out-too-long', 'sort', 'thing', 'going', 'just', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'actually', 'turned', 'off', 'halfway', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'Later', 'decided', 'paid', '11', 'should', 'finish', 'Then', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'up', 'laughed', 'stomach', 'hurt', 'eyebrow', 'women', 'infomercials', 'took', 'funny', 'first', 'half', 'put', 'second', 'half', 'Here', 'advice', 'first', 'half', 'microwave', 'nachos', 'drink', 'couple', 'beers', 'chat', 'friends', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'made', 'sit', 'Then', 'when', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'Earth', 'settle', 'watch', 'rest']",Evil Alien Conquerors

The story of 2 aliens coming to earth to cut off every persons head in 2 days is just absurd. Especially when their swords are shrunk to the size of cocktail picks. However, they never give up and when they fall for the local unibrow sisters, it's just too much. Filled with many classic lines and an ocean of Zima, this is a classic.

It was on HBO (or some other channel) and I was bored so I watched it. After the first minute, I knew had to TIVO it. I watched it two times that day because I had to force my roomates to watch it. It is laugh out loud funny and Diedrich Bader and Chris Parnell are perfect. They play two aliens from the planet Kabish aka Cabbage Land who are sent to behead every human on Earth. The catch? They have two days. Of course they are not as smart as they think they are and feel that it will be an easy mission.
