1149842,AN0ILVRWZUV4E,B0015L7RSG,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here, I decided to watch some of my favorite ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK episodes today to still Celebrate Halloween and me and my guy getting married (Halloween is our anniversary AND we Just Have to celebrate for more then one day as you know) And I had SO much fun watching these....(and I was also celebrating this last night. I had JUST found out that these were on DVD. (This show came out when I was 16.....and was one my FAVORITE shows on SNICK. And I had SO many FAVORITE episodes, I just thought I'd say which ones and why; my FAVORITE one is the Tale Of The Unfinished Painting. I loved that one since it 1st came out, I just think it's So interesting.....with the Paintings and the background stories that went with them. My guy is even painting me our FAVORITE painting The one that Cody paints. The Prom Queen. Now what's cool with this one.....is I had written my own version (I like writing Urban Legends) in the middle of October, my guy liked THAT story so much, he even got me my ghostly Hitchiker Living Dead doll....and THEN we had A lot of fun watching the episode. The Tale of The Many Faces. One of the 1st things I liked about THIS story is the Main Spree Sweater girl is nice like Buffy would be, and the other girl's a lot like Willow (even looks similar. And I like the idea of that cool powder that's supposed to start the spell (the compact is SO pretty.) The spellbook looks like a pretty purple journal (once it's empty) The Villian has been taken down, the girls are free...and other main girls get to be on magazine covers. The 13th floor. I've ALWAYS loved this one, I mean 1st off Its so wonderfully weird! And I LOVED the 13th floor even before it's the Toy factory/space ship....cause its just a cool warehouse. And the aliens only have one mission; to rescue their daughter. The daughter didn't remember enough in time.....and was going to be rescued in 10 years, but I like 2 wonder....since she knows now.....what happens? I dig that sort of thing! I like linking The Super Specs ep with this (cause the aliens and the people from the other dimension looked similar. But 1st the intro, that is A COOL magic shop with A COOL magic trick (you know the one that chops your finger off, that I would LOVE to scare someone with! Then of course; there's the Super Specs.....Now I've never even bought the fake X-Ray specks....But if they were Like This.....I would......it's just 2 cool! And I like how the alternate dimension wins...it reminds me of Normal Again and The Wish or Dopplegangland from Buffy! Then there's the Tale Of The Pinball Wizard. Now the Pinball game within itself....is REALLY cool, and looks REALLY fun! Then it's even more cool when it's like Mystical Live action version where he's in the machine forever. I like that ending as well....then there's my last one I'm talking about, The Tale of The Dollmaker. 1st....on a FUNNY note (the lady who's playing the....CANNOT act. In fact, her performance is rather odd; 1st......she's being WAY overdramatic (I thought this was funny when I 1st saw the episode) then I noticed something new today......when she's talking about Susan, she's looking off to the side like she's reading it off a cue card (which she PROBABLY is, I mean she's Really awful!) I LOVE the plot though! It's SO COOL! The SFX makeup looked SO COOL in fact I wished the 2 girls would've turned INTO dolls.....but that's just me, also the only complaint I've EVER had besides that ladies HORRIBLE acting was that they burned down the dollhouse, I mean COME ON! They didn't do that in my FAVORITE episode of Tales from The Darkside about the dollhouse, and in The Shining remake The Overlook was set to be rebuilt, so in MY version that's what happens, they're turned into dolls for several generations.......But that's a whole other story......",5,Submitted For The Approval Of The Midnight Society,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,3841,"['Hey', 'Sunnydale', 'Chick', 'here', 'decided', 'watch', 'favorite', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'DARK', 'today', 'still', 'Celebrate', 'Halloween', 'guy', 'getting', 'married', 'Halloween', 'anniversary', 'AND', 'Just', 'Have', 'celebrate', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'know', 'had', 'SO', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'was', 'also', 'celebrating', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'JUST', 'found', 'out', 'were', 'DVD', 'show', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', '16', '..and', 'was', 'one', 'FAVORITE', 'shows', 'SNICK', 'had', 'SO', 'many', 'FAVORITE', 'episodes', 'just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say', 'ones', 'why', 'FAVORITE', 'one', 'Tale', 'Unfinished', 'Painting', 'loved', 'one', '1st', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'think', 'So', 'interesting', 'Paintings', 'background', 'went', 'guy', 'even', 'painting', 'FAVORITE', 'painting', 'one', 'Cody', 'paints', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'Now', 'what', 'cool', 'one', '..is', 'had', 'written', 'own', 'version', 'like', 'writing', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'middle', 'October', 'guy', 'liked', 'THAT', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'got', 'ghostly', 'Hitchiker', 'Living', 'Dead', 'doll', '.and', 'THEN', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'episode', 'Tale', 'Many', 'Faces', 'One', '1st', 'things', 'liked', 'THIS', 'story', 'Main', 'Spree', 'Sweater', 'girl', 'nice', 'Buffy', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'girl', 'lot', 'Willow', 'even', 'similar', 'like', 'idea', 'cool', 'powder', 'supposed', 'start', 'spell', 'compact', 'SO', 'pretty', 'spellbook', 'pretty', 'purple', 'journal', 'empty', 'Villian', 'been', 'taken', 'down', 'girls', 'are', 'free', 'other', 'main', 'girls', 'get', 'be', 'magazine', 'covers', '13th', 'floor', ""'ve"", 'ALWAYS', 'loved', 'one', 'mean', '1st', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'weird', 'LOVED', '13th', 'floor', 'even', 'Toy', 'factory/space', 'ship', 'just', 'cool', 'warehouse', 'aliens', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'mission', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'enough', 'time', '..and', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rescued', '10', 'years', 'like', '2', 'wonder', '.since', 'now', '..what', 'dig', 'sort', 'thing', 'linking', 'Super', 'Specs', 'ep', 'cause', 'aliens', 'people', 'other', 'dimension', 'looked', 'similar', '1st', 'intro', 'COOL', 'magic', 'shop', 'A', 'COOL', 'magic', 'trick', 'know', 'one', 'finger', 'would', 'LOVE', 'scare', 'someone', 'Then', 'course', 'Super', 'Specs', '..Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'bought', 'fake', 'X-Ray', 'specks', '.But', 'were', '..I', 'would', 'just', '2', 'cool', 'like', 'how', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'wins', 'Normal', 'Again', 'Wish', 'Dopplegangland', 'Buffy', 'Then', 'Tale', 'Pinball', 'Wizard', 'Now', 'Pinball', 'game', '.is', 'REALLY', 'cool', 'REALLY', 'fun', 'Then', 'even', 'more', 'cool', 'when', 'like', 'Mystical', 'Live', 'action', 'version', 'where', 'machine', 'forever', 'like', 'ending', 'as', 'well', '.then', 'last', 'one', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Tale', 'Dollmaker', '1st', 'FUNNY', 'note', 'lady', 'who', 'playing', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'act', 'fact', 'performance', 'rather', 'odd', '1st', 'being', 'WAY', 'overdramatic', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'when', '1st', 'saw', 'episode', 'then', 'noticed', 'something', 'new', 'today', 'when', 'talking', 'Susan', 'looking', 'off', 'side', 'reading', 'off', 'cue', 'card', 'PROBABLY', 'mean', 'Really', 'awful', 'LOVE', 'plot', 'SO', 'COOL', 'SFX', 'makeup', 'looked', 'SO', 'COOL', 'fact', 'wished', '2', 'girls', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'INTO', 'dolls', '..but', 'just', 'also', 'only', 'complaint', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'had', 'besides', 'HORRIBLE', 'acting', 'was', 'burned', 'down', 'dollhouse', 'mean', 'COME', 'ON', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'FAVORITE', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'dollhouse', 'Shining', 'remake', 'Overlook', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'rebuilt', 'so', 'MY', 'version', 'what', ""'re"", 'turned', 'dolls', 'several', 'generations', 'whole', 'other', 'story']",Are You Afraid Of The Dark?

It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently.
