564747,A294XIDCE087BB,B0000524F3,"Irreverent ""irreverent""","[9, 11]","Okay, I probably liked watching CZJ more that I would have the real CTG, but surely there must be actresses who could have played the role better.  It's a shame we couldn't peel (sorry, I couldn't resist) a few decades off of Diana Rigg, or CZJ's co-star Jeanne Moreau, or better still, Francesca Annis. Get ""Lillie"" and watch Annis and a much better supporting cast (and direction and production) put CTG to shame (and they did it a quarter-century earlier) in a MUCH better costume show about a young woman who starts as an unsophisticated teen and conquers a man's world, royalty and all.  Annis is a lot more believable as she charms, beguiles, teases, scorns, tolerates, manipulates, and sometimes frostily discards kings, princes, artists, ministers, captains of commerce, seemingly whatever men she chooses -- all this without being a princess, czarina, or empress.  The boss ladies in ""I Claudius"" and Lindsay Duncan in ""Traffik"" likewise showed how it should be done.  The fake duchess in ""Hornblower"" and the perfect cast of ""Pride and Prejudice"" show that A & E can find great actresses now.  Why didn't they do it here?  For instance, the actress who played CTG's lady-in-waiting could probably have done a lot more with the lead role.The one star performance is by Jeanne Moreau as the aging / dying Empress Elizabeth.  Too bad she's gone before the movie's half over.  Ian Richardson is satisfactorily sly and slimy, but Omar Sharif helps prove that actors, like wines, do not all age well (sorry to say that about a fellow bridge freak).  The role of Potemkin could have been so much greater than the hardly believable boy-toy play it got.This movie is worth watching because it depicts highly significant times and events often ignored in the US as we focus on our late colonial and early revolutionary events occurring about the same time.  Also, for the guys, sure, CZJ is definitive delicious brunette yumminess (but Sophia was better), and we get lotsa good cleavage shots, but in a skin flick, I want more skin.",3,"Coulda, shoulda been better",1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,2032,"['Okay', 'probably', 'liked', 'watching', 'CZJ', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'real', 'CTG', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'better', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'peel', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'few', 'decades', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'CZJ', 'co-star', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'better', 'still', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'Get', 'Lillie', 'watch', 'Annis', 'much', 'better', 'supporting', 'cast', 'direction', 'production', 'put', 'CTG', 'shame', 'did', 'quarter-century', 'earlier', 'MUCH', 'better', 'costume', 'show', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unsophisticated', 'teen', 'conquers', 'man', 'world', 'royalty', 'Annis', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'beguiles', 'teases', 'scorns', 'tolerates', 'manipulates', 'sometimes', 'frostily', 'discards', 'kings', 'princes', 'artists', 'ministers', 'captains', 'commerce', 'seemingly', 'men', 'being', 'princess', 'czarina', 'empress', 'boss', 'Claudius', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'Traffik', 'likewise', 'showed', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'fake', 'duchess', 'Hornblower', 'perfect', 'cast', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'show', 'A', 'E', 'can', 'find', 'great', 'actresses', 'now', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'here', 'instance', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'CTG', 'lady-in-waiting', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'more', 'lead', 'role.The', 'one', 'star', 'performance', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'aging', '/', 'dying', 'Empress', 'Elizabeth', 'Too', 'bad', 'gone', 'movie', 'half', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'satisfactorily', 'sly', 'slimy', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'prove', 'actors', 'wines', 'do', 'not', 'age', 'well', 'sorry', 'say', 'about', 'fellow', 'bridge', 'freak', 'role', 'Potemkin', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'greater', 'hardly', 'believable', 'boy-toy', 'play', 'got.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'highly', 'significant', 'times', 'events', 'often', 'ignored', 'US', 'focus', 'late', 'colonial', 'early', 'revolutionary', 'events', 'occurring', 'same', 'time', 'Also', 'guys', 'sure', 'CZJ', 'definitive', 'delicious', 'brunette', 'yumminess', 'Sophia', 'was', 'better', 'get', 'lotsa', 'good', 'cleavage', 'shots', 'skin', 'flick', 'want', 'more', 'skin']",Catherine the Great VHS

564754,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,B0000524F3,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[61, 69]","I had high expectations for this film before release, but now I expect to sell my copy and return to the far superior 1991 film ""Young Catherine"" starring Julia Ormond (particularly the unedited 180+ minute version).  THAT film was well acted, well cast, well scripted, and convincing in the details.  This piece of hackneyed,  romance novel-level  schlock isn't worth the time it takes to watch.  If it was any more cardboard, it would be on the grocery shelves holding cornflakes.Zeta-Jones can't do anything with the lines she's given, and I expect the chief reason guys might enjoy this is to watch Catherine happily hop from bed to bed with a succession of hard-to-distinguish lovers (generally in pursuit of some political gain).  But even this grows joyless very quickly.  CZJ's boy toys are so drab, listless, and ugly that one wonders what the producers were thinking.  Even the bodice-buster elements in ""Young Catherine"" at least featured a more attractive male lead.The so-called battle scenes are pathetic: a tiny handful of extras milling about in confusion.  The Turks are beaten several times in inexplicable affairs (all fought in the woods, no less) that last about thirty seconds each.  A subplot involving a rebellious Cossack chieftain (capably played by John Rys-Davies -- the Welsh are taking over Mother Russia!)  should have added drama but instead only adds to the confusion regarding Catherine's true motivations.  Earlier in the movie, when she's casually seizing power (coups were never so clean and easy as presented here), she announces her desire to free Russia's serfs; by movie's end, she is blithely executing her enemies in defence of the status quo.  No explanations for this apparent sea-change are given.  And we're supposed to find this character sympathetic?  It's typical of this film's  confused treatment of  real history and people.  There's no depth of characterization or feel for the intrigues and struggles of the times.  And several scenes have been shamelessly stolen from other movies such as ""Young Catherine"" and ""Waterloo"".It's a lazy, unengaging movie that offers little.  Seek out the witty, intelligent, and lavish ""Young Catherine"" (which was actually filmed IN Russia) instead if you want to see a genuinely entertaining historical drama.",1,"Catherine the Not-So-Great: Wooden, dull, and confusing",983836800,"03 6, 2001",2001,2298,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'release', 'now', 'expect', 'sell', 'copy', 'return', 'far', 'superior', '1991', 'film', 'Young', 'Catherine', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'particularly', 'unedited', '180+', 'minute', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'cast', 'well', 'scripted', 'convincing', 'details', 'piece', 'hackneyed', 'romance', 'novel-level', 'schlock', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'watch', 'was', 'more', 'cardboard', 'would', 'be', 'grocery', 'holding', 'cornflakes.Zeta-Jones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'lines', 'given', 'expect', 'chief', 'reason', 'guys', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'Catherine', 'happily', 'bed', 'bed', 'succession', 'hard-to-distinguish', 'lovers', 'generally', 'pursuit', 'political', 'gain', 'even', 'joyless', 'very', 'quickly', 'CZJ', 'boy', 'toys', 'are', 'so', 'drab', 'listless', 'ugly', 'one', 'what', 'producers', 'were', 'thinking', 'Even', 'bodice-buster', 'elements', 'Young', 'Catherine', 'least', 'featured', 'more', 'attractive', 'male', 'lead.The', 'so-called', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pathetic', 'tiny', 'handful', 'extras', 'milling', 'confusion', 'Turks', 'are', 'beaten', 'several', 'times', 'inexplicable', 'affairs', 'fought', 'woods', 'less', 'last', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'subplot', 'involving', 'rebellious', 'Cossack', 'chieftain', 'capably', 'played', 'John', 'Rys-Davies', 'Welsh', 'are', 'taking', 'over', 'Mother', 'Russia', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'drama', 'instead', 'only', 'confusion', 'regarding', 'Catherine', 'true', 'motivations', 'Earlier', 'movie', 'when', 'casually', 'seizing', 'power', 'coups', 'were', 'never', 'so', 'clean', 'easy', 'presented', 'here', 'desire', 'free', 'Russia', 'serfs', 'movie', 'end', 'blithely', 'executing', 'enemies', 'defence', 'status', 'quo', 'explanations', 'apparent', 'sea-change', 'are', 'given', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'typical', 'film', 'confused', 'treatment', 'real', 'history', 'people', 'depth', 'characterization', 'feel', 'intrigues', 'struggles', 'times', 'several', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'shamelessly', 'stolen', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Young', 'Catherine', 'Waterloo', '.It', 'lazy', 'unengaging', 'movie', 'little', 'Seek', 'out', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'lavish', 'Young', 'Catherine', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'IN', 'Russia', 'instead', 'want', 'see', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'historical', 'drama']",Catherine the Great VHS

And this movie does her absolutely no favors, not to mention the gross historical liberties taken to push this disjointed aznd rotten ""fairy tale"" along.True, the costuming and interior shots are lush and generally well done.

He is less intellectual powerhouse than moody and wishy-washy to the point of just being plain annoying.  And John Rhys-Davies, in my opinion, rather just walked around looking embarassed. Further, the historical Catherine never met Pugachev, and was far less a bed-hopper than the script portrays, altough Zeta-Jones manages here and there to capture a glimmer of Catherine's powerful intellect as well as her sometime intellectual pretentiousness.  And the main focus and contribution of Catherine's amazing life - her reformist zeal, legislative genius, but ultimate failure of Enlightenment vision - is barely touched on at all.
