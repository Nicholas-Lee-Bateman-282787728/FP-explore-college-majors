1440070,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B0053O8A8M,A fellow with a keyboard,"[15, 17]","If a better TV series has been created, I politely demand you to tell me what it is.I have never been so riveted by a TV series. I have never found a TV series so hilarious. And I have never found a TV series so moving.I suspect that in order for Community to have a similar type of effect on you, you must meet at least two criteria: (1) be between 20 and 35 years old, and (2) give your full attention to every nano-second of the show.Re: (2): There is so much substance packed into every nano-second of the show that it demands your full attention to notice the subtleties and to understand exactly what the show's writers are trying to get at. You'll probably need/want to watch some episodes several times.Re: (1): The first time I saw the show was at my parents' house, and while I was literally - not figuratively - screaming like an injured lemur with laughter, my Boomer parents barely managed a polite smile. The generational divide was never so apparent.The show speaks directly to my generation, and not just to amuse us, but to tell us things we urgently need to hear. E.g.:* ""Britta's attracted to men in emotional pain. It helps her think that she's emotionally healthy.""* ""Jeff, you're a normal person. There's nothing very special about you at all. You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.""* ""While claiming to have no religion, you're actually devoutly worshipping yourself.""* ""We need more respect and less passion.""* ""TV makes sense. It has structure, logic, rules, and likeable leading men. In life we have this. We have you.""And there's so much more that isn't easily pick-up-able from little lines of dialogue. The general message of the show is (crudely) wake up, grow up, what's important is right in front of you.God bless Dan Harmon. May he make many more TV shows.---Regarding Season 3 in particular, I think ""Virtual Systems Analysis"" might be the best show of the whole series. At least top 3. ""Urban Matrimony and the Sandwich Arts"" and ""Digital Exploration of Interior Design"" are also favorites.",5,"If a better TV series has been created, I politely demand you to tell me what it is",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,2060,"['better', 'TV', 'series', 'been', 'created', 'politely', 'demand', 'tell', 'what', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'riveted', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'hilarious', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'TV', 'series', 'moving.I', 'suspect', 'order', 'Community', 'have', 'similar', 'type', 'effect', 'must', 'meet', 'least', 'two', 'criteria', '1', 'be', '20', '35', 'years', 'old', '2', 'give', 'full', 'attention', 'nano-second', 'show.Re', '2', 'so', 'much', 'substance', 'packed', 'nano-second', 'show', 'full', 'attention', 'notice', 'subtleties', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'show', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'get', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'need/want', 'watch', 'episodes', 'several', 'times.Re', '1', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'show', 'was', 'parents', 'house', 'was', 'literally', 'not', 'figuratively', 'screaming', 'injured', 'lemur', 'laughter', 'Boomer', 'parents', 'barely', 'managed', 'polite', 'smile', 'generational', 'divide', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'apparent.The', 'show', 'directly', 'generation', 'not', 'just', 'amuse', 'tell', 'things', 'urgently', 'need', 'hear', 'E.g', '*', 'Britta', 'attracted', 'men', 'emotional', 'pain', 'think', 'emotionally', 'healthy', '*', 'Jeff', ""'re"", 'normal', 'person', 'nothing', 'very', 'special', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'great', 'few', 'things', 'really', 'crappy', 'many', 'more', '*', 'claiming', 'have', 'religion', ""'re"", 'actually', 'devoutly', 'worshipping', '*', 'need', 'more', 'respect', 'less', 'passion', '*', 'TV', 'sense', 'structure', 'logic', 'rules', 'likeable', 'leading', 'men', 'life', 'have', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""n't"", 'easily', 'pick-up-able', 'little', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'general', 'message', 'show', 'crudely', 'wake', 'up', 'grow', 'up', 'what', 'important', 'right', 'front', 'you.God', 'bless', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'May', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'TV', 'shows.', '-Regarding', 'Season', '3', 'particular', 'think', 'Virtual', 'Systems', 'Analysis', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'whole', 'series', 'least', 'top', '3', 'Urban', 'Matrimony', 'Sandwich', 'Arts', 'Digital', 'Exploration', 'Interior', 'Design', 'are', 'also', 'favorites']",Community: Season 3

1440072,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0053O8A8M,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 2]","It's the group's third year at Greendale Community College and once again their attempts to get good grades are threatened by their flamboyant Dean, the mentally unstable Chang (now unwisely made part of the college's security force) and a new threat in the form of Vice Dean Laybourne, head of the Air Conditioning Repair Annex, who now seeks to take control of the college for himself.After the second season of Community, which featured an overload of classic, high-concept episodes and an internal battle between the other members of the group and Pierce, it was unclear which direction the third season would go in. For the first couple of episodes, it's clear the producers don't either. The addition of John Goodman (as Laybourne) and Michel K. Williams as Professor Kane are good starts, but it's not until the third episode, Remedial Chaos Theory, that the show hits its former stride again. The Emmy and Hugo-nominated episode, which revisits the same events in six different timelines and cleverly comments on each character's place in the group in the process, is flat-out hilarious as well as being clever, and sets up a couple of recurring elements that are periodically revisited throughout the year.However, despite this early high point, the third season remains patchy. The decision to tone Pierce down this season results in his near-total absence from many episodes. Without him in an adversarial role, the writers seem to struggle to find something plausible for him each week without him falling back on his traditional (and now rather tired) homophobia and casual racism. There is a potentially promising storyline when Pierce's ancient and even more horrific father arrives in town, allowing the writers to show how the group has made Pierce (relatively) more tolerant and understanding, but even this is under-explored.In the meantime, we have yet more adventures with Chang being insane, which is getting old. Ken Jeong is funny enough that this - more or less - works, but you can't help feeling it's a bit of a cheap stand-by. Even worse is the decision to make Dean Pelton a regular character. This results in a lot of running gags and very broad comedy based around the fact that the Dean is gay, which feels odd for a series that spends so much time trying to avoid cliches. Having said that, the Dean's battle with his nemesis Laybourne does give the season a dramatic spine and a sense of direction.Elsewhere, the performances of the regulars remain superb, individual gags are often hilarious and, after taking a back seat in Season 2, character development moves to the fore, with the show concentrating on Abed as an actual character than an ongoing commentary on what's happening in each episode. Annie, Shirley, Troy and Jeff also get good moments of character evolution throughout the season. On the flipside of that, Britta fares poorly, with the slight turn she took into 'dumb blonde' territory in Season 2 now turning into a full-scale character regression (so overt that it's even lampshaded at one point). It's a shame that a character who was an essential foil for Jeff in the first two seasons is now being treated as a hate figure by almost everyone.In terms of the episodes, Remedial Chaos Theory is the undeniable high point, but other episodes are strong. Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps, in which the gang tell horror stories (so Britta can try to work out which of them is a sociopath-in-the-making) is extremely amusing, especially Abed's remorselessly sensible and logical take on a horror movie narrative. The Ken Burns-influenced mid-season two-parter, which presents an epic blanket fort vs pillow fort war fought across the whole college (complete with detailed, animated maps of the battle lines and commentary from those involved), is another instant classic. Basic Lupine Urology isn't just a great episode, but also a phenomenal mickey-take of the Law and Order franchise (and Michael K. Williams gets to make a few references to his former role as Omar on The Wire, which takes place in the same fictional universe). Curriculum Unavailable tries to recast the events of the entire series with the study group being inmates at a mental institution, a successful satire of unconvincing 'plot twists' in long-running series. Digital Estate Planning, which forces the group to play an 8-bit video game, is almost as good as Remedial, with the video game being used to expose both rifts in the group (not to mention the Christian Shirley's suppressed homicidal streak) and encourage their cooperation as well.Against this, there's probably a few too many episodes centred around the Dean and Chang, whose broad characterisations don't lend themselves too well to central roles in an ongoing series. There's also the feeling that Community's meta-awareness and commitment to avoiding cliche is too often turned into distinct smugness at its own cleverness. This is most notable in the first few episodes, before it calms down and just gets on with having fun again.After the third season, Community wouldn't quite be the same again. Showrunner Dan Harmon was taken off the show for the fourth season (though he would return for the fifth) and Chevy Chase would depart in the following year.The third season of Community (****) is relentlessly entertaining, very funny and often very clever. Where it falls down is not matching it own very high standards and occasionally getting too tangled up in its own desire to be funny whilst avoiding stereotypes, whilst not always having anything new or interesting for the characters to do (particularly Britta, Pierce, Chang and the Dean). But ultimately this is still one of the funniest shows on the air. The season is available on DVD in the UK and USA.",4,"Solid, with a few classic episodes, but not as good as Season 2",1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,5761,"['group', 'third', 'year', 'Greendale',

I missed John Glover but this season was still great. The change in Britta's character almost made her my new favorite character. My favorite is Annie. I thought Britta was hilarious. One of my favorite episodes was the Christmas episode. Alison Brie had a fun scene seducing Jeff while singing a funny Christmas song. Pierce's role in the show seems to lessen but he still makes his prescience felt in episodes like Advanced Gay, Basic Lupine Urology, Digital Estate Planning. The Halloween episode is great just like the previous season's episode. In this episode each member of the study group tells a spooky horror story and it's something fun to do on Halloween. In Pillows and Blankets the two inseparable buddies Troy and Abed are split in war. Things continue to put a strain on their relationship when Troy discovers he has special feelings for one of the girls in the study group. I found that story in this season interesting and exciting for the character of Troy. Another one of my personal favorite episodes was Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism. Jeff and Shirley discover they have a prior history that was not so good. It was a touching episode and further develops Jeff into a more likable character as we see the time he spent with the study group is changing him for the better. And of course there is the widely talented Ken Jeong playing a villain. He is good at that. Even Pierce who most of the time is a jerk and unlikable has some good moments. I was never so happy to hear there was a Season Four because I think this show is great. I love the humor and characters. I respect the fans of this show because they helped make this show last longer than a couple seasons by speaking out for the love of their show. I am so happy it got a fifth season. I am excited to see what is in store for the study group. I hope Community stays on the air for a long time. I think with so many great shows like 30 rock and The Office going off the air it leaves Community as being one of the best shows still on air.

I've also taken the time to watch some videos of Writer Dan Harmon and this has greatly helped me to understand his vision for the show and how well thought out the entire show is (not just each individual episode).  This is where these DVDs really start adding their value as Dan Harmon commentary, palyfest, comicon, etc. really help you understand the genius he brings to the show.Season 3 is the dark season.  Its how Harmon characterizes the growth of a relation and its the part that will test the friendship endured so far.  It will either tear them apart, or drive them closer together.  Once I understood this, each episode made much more sense.  I was also concerned that there might not be much else to do outside of the study room.  With 3 paintball episodes, and far too many dances, I was worried about where we would go to keep the show popping.  My worry was in vein.Season 3 contains the study group tackling a new Biology professor who has a special appreciation for life gleaned from years spent in prison.  It dares to explore the group as they encounter separate timelines.  We become privy to Brita's declared major and how she will work within the group with her new skills.  We see Jeff play Foosball, the study group sings, Shirley makes sandwiches, we get a law and order spoof, someone dies, and we are presented with a fantastic 8 bit episode.  In short... We don't need no stinking paintball.The show continues to delve deep in multi-layered plot twists chocked full of cleverly written pop references and dynamically acted out by a superb cast.  The musical talent of the cast is once again brought to light, but so is the talent of the song-writers and directors on staff.Three years in and this show still gets an A+ in every conceivable category.  Sadly, this season marks the end of Dan's writing and leadership.  It also marks the apparent end of a full season as season 4 has only been ordered with 13 episode across the board from NBC.  Two more reasons to complete the Community trilogy with this season 3 DVD.  While it doesn't look like this show will complete its ""6 seasons and a movie"", It did release 3 full seasons + in less than ideal circumstances, and remains one of the most intelligent and underrated comedies of its time.I recommend Community to any sitcom fan for a fresh look at life, politics, pop culture, story telling, acting, music, and more.

Don't get me wrong, the show was still plenty of fun up to, and including, the Xmas Glee episode (Regional Holiday Music). After that is where things went wrong for me. Why?1) Way too much Chang. Having a side character who, in my opinion, always had the stupidest humor take such a big role led to episodes filled with stupid humor in a series which was built on cleverer things.2) Too much Abed. Now I am sure this is where I am going to lose some people. Abed is great, especially with Troy and the way their combined wackiness fits into the group. However, on his own he is either morbidly depressing or too far removed from the comedy aspect of the show. Especially morbid are the episodes in the dreamatorium. Also, bringing back evil Abed was just depressing. What I always loved about Community was that it would occasionally take a pop culture reference and work it into the on-goings at Greendale. That way it managed to have its own personality while parodying or commenting on various things. When entire episodes turn into parodies of those things though, it turns into just a low quality rip off.3) Pushing the Dean into further ridiculousness. I enjoyed the dean in the first two seasons. He was a desperate, weird, oddball, leading a school which would never go anywhere. In season 3 though, most of what he does is dress in various women's outfits and emphasize his crush on Jeff.4) The whole Troy and A/C school thing. Good for one episode but just not fun or interesting enough to keep bringing up.I know Community fans are rabid and will, at best, ignore this review or, worse, start nasty comments. Keep in mind folks, I was one of you. I wish I still could be. Sadly this show has been going very much the way of ""My name is Earl"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle"".

This third season continues in its departure from the first seasons more &#34;Arrested Development&#34;-esque gradual plot development, in favor of biting episodic send-offs of rival shows and our society.If anyone is a villain in this season, it is Jeff, whose vanity and self-absorbed nature are a major engine driving the plot developments of the season, even though none of the main story arcs are about him. However, once Evil Abed makes his appearance, and Chang launches his coup, we recognize how close we all are. There are three terrific story arcs this season, which gel well and make use of all the characters, including Jim Rash as Dean Pelton, reoccurring guest star John Goodman as Vice Dean Labor, and Ken Jeong as &#34;Chang.&#34;With a fantastic spoof of Glee (featuring Taran Killam as the Sweater Vest wearing Glee instructor), the show continues to show that it is not only a wonderfully funny show, but also quite capable of pointing out our societal foibles, with regards to our entertainment and predilections.This show is simply, BRILLIANT! It is funny, clever, and exceptionally well-written, with pithy dialogue, and a great development of plot. The cast is one of the best on television, and the writers make sure that each character receives a fair share of story time and screen time, so that we can full appreciate their talents. There is no weak link anywhere!Dani Pudi is a prodigy, and yes, I will go there... even though exceptionally talented actors in their own rights, Gillian Jacobs and Alison Brie was simply STUNNING to look at, to compliment their great comedic character development.Chevy Chase delivers, as we might expect.Joel McHale carries off his arrogant, over-grown emo kid with finesse, Donald Glover is great throughout the season as he matures from high school jock to adult, and Yvette Nicole Brown is wonderful, as the kind preaching Christian who is ubiquitous in American society. The strength of this show is that we either are or know every single one of these characters.It is a crime that this show struggles to stay on the air season after season. It is, likely, the result of the poor taste of so much of the TV audience that leads to this, and is something of which the writers are keenly aware, as they sprinkle lots of references to the show's struggles in the dialogue, while skewering the more &#34;popular&#34; tastes.",5,Brilliant!!!!!!,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2566,"['singing', 'dancing', 'letting', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'weird', 'Season', 'immediately', 'proceed', 'be', 'just', 'delightfully', 'weird', 'satirical', 'seasons', 'past', 'third', 'season', 'departure', 'first', 'seasons', 'more', '34', 'Arrested', 'Development', '34', '-esque', 'gradual', 'plot', 'development', 'favor', 'biting', 'episodic', 'send-offs', 'rival', 'shows', 'society.If', 'anyone', 'villain', 'season', 'Jeff', 'vanity', 'self-absorbed', 'nature', 'are', 'major', 'engine', 'driving', 'plot', 'developments', 'season', 'even', 'none', 'main', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'However', 'once', 'Evil', 'Abed', 'appearance', 'Chang', 'coup', 'recognize', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'are', 'three', 'terrific', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', 'gel', 'well', 'make', 'use', 'characters', 'including', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'Dean', 'Pelton', 'reoccurring', 'guest', 'star', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Vice', 'Dean', 'Labor', 'Ken', 'Jeong', '34', 'Chang.', '34', 'fantastic', 'spoof', 'Glee', 'featuring', 'Taran', 'Killam', 'Sweater', 'Vest', 'wearing', 'Glee', 'instructor', 'show', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'show', 'also', 'quite', 'capable', 'pointing', 'out', 'societal', 'foibles', 'regards', 'entertainment', 'predilections.This', 'show', 'simply', 'BRILLIANT', 'funny', 'clever', 'exceptionally', 'well-written', 'pithy', 'dialogue', 'great', 'development', 'plot', 'cast', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'writers', 'make', 'sure', 'character', 'fair', 'share', 'story', 'time', 'screen', 'time', 'so', 'can', 'full', 'appreciate', 'talents', 'weak', 'link', 'anywhere', 'Dani', 'Pudi', 'prodigy', 'yes', 'will', 'go', 'there', 'even', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'actors', 'own', 'rights', 'Gillian', 'Jacobs', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'was', 'simply', 'STUNNING', 'look', 'compliment', 'great', 'comedic', 'character', 'development.Chevy', 'Chase', 'delivers', 'might', 'expect.Joel', 'McHale', 'arrogant', 'over-grown', 'emo', 'kid', 'finesse', 'Donald', 'Glover', 'great', 'season', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'adult', 'Yvette', 'Nicole', 'Brown', 'wonderful', 'kind', 'preaching', 'Christian', 'who', 'ubiquitous', 'American', 'society', 'strength', 'show', 'are', 'know', 'single', 'one', 'characters.It', 'crime', 'show', 'stay', 'air', 'season', 'season', 'likely', 'result', 'poor', 'taste', 'so', 'much', 'TV', 'audience', 'something', 'writers', 'are', 'keenly', 'aware', 'sprinkle', 'lots', 'references', 'show', 'struggles', 'dialogue', 'skewering', 'more', '34', 'popular', '34', 'tastes']",Community: Season 3

Lastly, britta being made stupid is inconsistent with season one. Harmon just took it there bec the twits wanted it but it makes no sense at all.The writing on the wall is the show is toast. no offense. but like bush beat kerry, one has to accept the inevitable unless they come from behind like seinfeld.i think the video game episode was fantastic but the pillow fight was terrible execution.the ANNIE character is simply phenom from an acting POV.

Now while my opinion may be a little subjective, the writing, the characters, the entire premise of the show just appeals to me in a great way and I'm sure to millions of other people as well. I am sad to say that this wonderful show doesn't have the highest ratings on television, and I cannot find the reason why? This show is ten times funnier than anything on CBS, and yes I do mean ""The Big Bang Theory"" as well. Seriously, this show is 10x more ambitious, and dares to be different which just makes me appreciate the creative road this show just continues to take really pushing a lot of boundaries taking unexpected risks that the show is famous for. This season is noticeably different than the previous 2, I will say that this season is a bit darker in tone because of the focus on exploring some of the characters psyches and back stories a bit more. Character developments continue to raise more questions than answers, but the characters are just so loveable and intriguing that sometimes you forget about their personal bios and just enjoy whats happening in the moment of the episodes... To be perfectly honest, the episodes of this season is what hooked me on Community in the first place so I can't say I'm a hardcore fan being that I only came across the series on a happy accident not too long ago (not to mention I'm a huge Donald Glover/Childish Gambino fan). I was just surfing through demand on my DVR and I watched ONE episode, just one, and that episode happened to be ""Pillows & Blankets"" after watching the genius in that episode alone was enough to pull me into the ENTIRE series buying the Season 1 DVD not too long after and my love fandom just grew from there. I will take season 3 with a grain of salt to say that this season is slightly weaker than the previous seasons not in quality, but in storytelling, it really gets darker and loses some of the fun from previous seasons. Season 3 is the most experiemental season so far of Community and I guess I just wasn't prepared for that. Needless to say Season 3 is still fantastic in every sense.Love the DVD, commentary on every single episode (once again), great featurettes on the making on some of the more ""special"" episodes, and hilarious outtakes which I have always found enoyable on every season release of Community. Point being, I hope that this show continues to do well and gain more viewers, and even though the creator Dan Harmon may be out of the picture, I hope the new season can still capture all the things that make this series so special. And who knows, Dan Harmon might return at some point in time to continue or maybe even finish off his beloved show (just not now). If your a fan of Community like I am, continue to support the show, if you don't watch the show WATCH IT!! its as simple as that, you will not be dissapointed.P.S.

The DVD, however, appears to reflect ongoing cost cutting against &#34;Community&#34; by Sony & NBC:1.)  Much of the background music that played loud and clear on TV and Hulu is subdued or absent from the DVD episodes.  For example, the &#34;Dark Knight&#34; theme of Abed's Batman appearances in &#34;Foosball&#34; is gone.  Was this to keep licensing costs down?2.)  There's just a smattering of deleted scenes and none of them have any text or commentary to establish context.3.)  No extended episodes?  Not even for &#34;Remedial Chaos Theory&#34;, which everyone agreed was a giant project that had to be whittled way down to fit into a half hour time slot?4.)  On the commentary voice-overs the actors and writers frequently spend most of each episode making irrelevant small talk, seemingly assuming the viewer is already familiar with the episode's creative process.I give Sony credit for brightening and correcting what had been gloomy, apparently underexposed video.  You can really see the difference between the DVD and the broadcast/online versions.

1440120,A2N60VDBR10N18,B0053O8A8M,Tyler Johnson,"[3, 4]","Community has been one of the most joyous surprises on network tv in years. When it first debuted, it seemed like it was going to follow the basic sitcom strategy we've seen so many times before. By the time we saw the first paintball episode though, we knew this show was destined for greatness. Season two improved on the first in nearly every way, and set the bar for season three impossibly high. The good news is, Season three delivers in almost every way but one; consistency.Season three starts off with two enjoyable, but disappointing episodes. The third episode however, gave us a glimpse of what this season truly had in store for us. ""Remedial Chaos Theory"" is Community in it's purest form; taking tried and true sitcom cliches, turning them on their head, and then slipping LSD into their drink when they aren't looking. This episode shows six alternate timelines created when Jeff suggests rolling a die to decided who goes downstairs to get the groups Pizza. What follows practically defies description, though I will say if the darkest time line didn't seem dark enough to you, stick around after the credits roll; it gets so much better.Overall, season three is much darker than its previous seasons, but never too dark. The next few episodes are great, but brilliance once again shines through in ""Documentary Filmaking: Redux"". Dean pelton has been given permission to update Greendale's woefully out of date promotional commercial. What follows is so wonderfully extreme, the absurdity of it seems natural. Luis Guzman makes a welcome appearance, and Joel Mchale's Dean impression is worth the price of admission by itself.From there, the season takes off at a sprint and never lets up. What follows are some of the best half hours on television ever created. From ""Regional Holiday Music""'s pitch perfect lampooning of ""Glee"", to a parody of law and order in ""Basic Lupine Urology"" so flawless you'll be waiting to see Detective Munch stroll through the set, Community shows what is possible when the writing, acting, and directing are all in perfect synch.I feel special mention should be made as to ""Digital Estate Planning"", and the fact that it is one of, if not the, most accurate representations of a video game I have ever seen in Prime time television, ever. The level of detail that went into this tour de force is only enhanced by the presence of the incomparable Giancarlo Esposito, ofBreaking Bad: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray] fame.The two part finale perfectly wraps the season up. Community season three contains the best episodes of the series, and is without a doubt the pinnacle of the series so far. It is an absolute classic, and a must buy.On an unrelated note, Dan Harmon, the showrunner of this series from conception, has been removed. What this means for the upcoming season remains to be seen, but I encourage everybody to at least give it a chance. Even though it will surely be different, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be worse.
