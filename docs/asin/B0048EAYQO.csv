1389158,A2KHO1VHMOVHE1,B0048EAYQO,J. Morales,"[0, 0]","This is a fun show.  The art is well-done and the English actors also do a good job.  The plot is a bit slow to start but relatively interesting.  The characters are all likeable enough and their interactions work well as long as provide some humor and drama.  The action scenes are well-done and visually interesting.The thing I like most about the show is also its biggest weakness.  Namely the fact that the main character Layfon, is a total fighting beast.  It's nice to see a protagonist that starts out strong rather than someone who starts out a bumbling fool and becomes strong.  On the other hand Layfon is so strong, that it starts to get ridiculous.  The rest of Layfon's platoon really don't seem to matter because he is so monstrously strong.  If the show had a little more balance between Layfon's strength and everyone else's, I would have rated it higher.Is this show worth getting?  I would say yes, but make sure to buy it on a sale.",3,I wanted to like this more then I did,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,951,"['fun', 'show', 'art', 'well-done', 'English', 'actors', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'plot', 'bit', 'slow', 'start', 'relatively', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'enough', 'interactions', 'work', 'well', 'as', 'long', 'provide', 'humor', 'drama', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-done', 'visually', 'interesting.The', 'thing', 'like', 'most', 'show', 'also', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'Namely', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'Layfon', 'total', 'fighting', 'beast', 'nice', 'see', 'protagonist', 'out', 'strong', 'rather', 'someone', 'who', 'out', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'strong', 'other', 'hand', 'Layfon', 'so', 'strong', 'get', 'ridiculous', 'rest', 'Layfon', 'platoon', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'so', 'monstrously', 'strong', 'show', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'balance', 'Layfon', 'strength', 'everyone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher.Is', 'show', 'getting', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'make', 'sure', 'buy', 'sale']",N/A

1389160,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0048EAYQO,RavenRing,"[3, 3]","In the far distant future, people live in large, domed moving cities, because the outside air is poisonous and bug like monsters known as Contaminoids wander the earth. Zuelleni is an academic city where pretty much the entire population is made up of students and everything is run by the student council president. Layfon, a teenage boy with a mysterious past, comes to Zuelleni to escape said past. He wants to start his life anew, as a regular, average student. But too bad for him - upon arriving at school for the first day, he is immediately forced into the military arts program. He is assigned to the 17th Platoon, after leader Nina asks for him to fill a recently vacated spot on the team. The rest of the platoon consists of mechanical ace Harley, sharpshooter and ladies man Sharnid, and ne'in operator Felli. However, it is pretty soon evident that Layfon isn't in any need of military training.....I actually quite enjoyed this series. I'm not really sure why, since there are many weak points and plot holes. But I think a big part of my enjoyment was the fact that Layfon starts out as an extremely strong fighter. It was kind of refreshing to have a character that didn't need to push his limits of endurance in order to master that next powerful technique so he can save... who or whatever. In addition, Layfon's technique is just really cool. He has as sword, which isn't very interesting, but he also wields a multi threaded whip like device. The threads are made of up his 'kei', so there are as many of them as he wants to generate, they are extremely sharp, and he has great control over them. It was just fun to watch any fight where he used that weapon.I rated this half the series 4 stars, but really overall it is a 3 star show. I enjoyed the world the series was set in, I liked Felli and Layfon, I didn't really hate any of the characters, and the plot was interesting. However! There is no resolution in the end. All those questions raised during the course of the series? 2 are answered. Really. Layfon's reason for coming to Zuelleni and Leerin's relationship to the Queen are the only 2 explained. Out of, I dunno, 10 important questions? Yeah, basically 1/5 of the mystery behind the show is explained. The ending was really pathetic.But despite the (enormous) setbacks, I still like the show and still think it is something worth watching for the random entertainment. I'll probably buy it once a cheap set comes out. But I will forever be disappointed with how the ending was handled.",4,A review of the complete series,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,2520,"['far', 'distant', 'future', 'people', 'live', 'large', 'domed', 'moving', 'cities', 'outside', 'air', 'poisonous', 'bug', 'monsters', 'known', 'Contaminoids', 'wander', 'earth', 'Zuelleni', 'academic', 'city', 'where', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'population', 'made', 'students', 'everything', 'run', 'student', 'council', 'president', 'Layfon', 'teenage', 'boy', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Zuelleni', 'escape', 'said', 'past', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'regular', 'average', 'student', 'too', 'bad', 'arriving', 'school', 'first', 'day', 'immediately', 'forced', 'military', 'arts', 'program', 'assigned', '17th', 'Platoon', 'leader', 'Nina', 'fill', 'recently', 'vacated', 'spot', 'team', 'rest', 'platoon', 'mechanical', 'ace', 'Harley', 'sharpshooter', 'ladies', 'man', 'Sharnid', ""ne'in"", 'operator', 'Felli', 'However', 'pretty', 'soon', 'evident', 'Layfon', ""n't"", 'need', 'military', 'training', '..I', 'actually', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'many', 'weak', 'points', 'plot', 'holes', 'think', 'big', 'part', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'fact', 'Layfon', 'out', 'extremely', 'strong', 'fighter', 'was', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'have', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'push', 'limits', 'endurance', 'order', 'master', 'next', 'powerful', 'technique', 'can', 'save', 'who', 'addition', 'Layfon', 'technique', 'just', 'really', 'cool', 'as', 'sword', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'multi', 'threaded', 'whip', 'device', 'threads', 'are', 'made', ""'kei"", 'are', 'many', 'generate', 'are', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'great', 'control', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'fight', 'where', 'used', 'weapon.I', 'rated', 'series', '4', 'stars', 'really', 'overall', '3', 'star', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'world', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'liked', 'Felli', 'Layfon', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hate', 'characters', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'However', 'resolution', 'end', 'questions', 'raised', 'course', 'series', '2', 'are', 'answered', 'Really', 'Layfon', 'reason', 'coming', 'Zuelleni', 'Leerin', 'relationship', 'Queen', 'are', 'only', '2', 'explained', 'dunno', '10', 'important', 'questions', 'Yeah', 'basically', '1/5', 'mystery', 'show', 'explained', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'pathetic.But', 'enormous', 'setbacks', 'still', 'show', 'still', 'think', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'random', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'once', 'cheap', 'set', 'out', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'ending', 'was', 'handled']",N/A
1389161,AFV2584U13XP3,B0048EAYQO,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 4]","While on whole the series has what many like myself found enjoyable it also had the standard of so many anime series too,  the mysterious but powerful handsome young male fighter with a shadowy past who comes into a new city and becomes the infatuation of a young group of females who are vying for his attention either romantically or because of his fighting prowess.  This series has domed movable cities called Regios each with their own governments and laws pretty much like countries,  and the reason for this is because the atmosphere outside has become toxic due in part to mass pollution that has also spawned mutant insect like creatures that attack the mobile cities which in turned has forced the citizens to create a military corp who are able to use a unique form of energy combat styles to fight the creatures.  The main character Layfon Alseif who is our mysterious new comer apparently at first tries to stay in the civilian sector of the cities but due to a fight and becoming involved as he sees a young girl about to get hurt reveals his incredible fighting abilities to the city who than trick him into fighting for and to protect the city.  The series continues to show more of Layfon's past as well as the reasoning for his leaving his former mobile city home.  Most of the characters are enjoyable to watch but are pretty stereotypical for many anime series too with of course the love triangle as Layfon gets the usual gaggle of females trying to capture his heart and competing with each other with some of those scenes being pretty hilarious.  The animation and soundtrack fit well together and the subbed and dubbed cast were picked pretty well for their character roles too.  Like with the previous other two releases from Funimation this set comes in two parts,  the first set comes in a two thinpack dvd case put into a sturdy cardboard sleeve with the limited edition giving you the city of Zuellni mini-cloth flag to keep.  The second part is just two dvds put into a two thinpack dvd case inserted into a paper sleeve,  so if you like the standard fighting sci-fi series here's an enjoyable series to add to the collection....",5,A Entertaining And Enjoyable Anime But Has To Be Taken With A Grain Of Salt,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,2159,"['whole', 'series', 'what', 'many', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'had', 'standard', 'so', 'many', 'anime', 'series', 'too', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'handsome', 'young', 'male', 'fighter', 'shadowy', 'past', 'who', 'new', 'city', 'infatuation', 'young', 'group', 'females', 'who', 'are', 'vying', 'attention', 'romantically', 'fighting', 'prowess', 'series', 'domed', 'movable', 'cities', 'called', 'Regios', 'own', 'governments', 'laws', 'pretty', 'much', 'countries', 'reason', 'atmosphere', 'outside', 'become', 'toxic', 'due', 'part', 'mass', 'pollution', 'also', 'spawned', 'mutant', 'insect', 'creatures', 'attack', 'mobile', 'cities', 'turned', 'forced', 'citizens', 'create', 'military', 'corp', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'unique', 'form', 'energy', 'combat', 'styles', 'fight', 'creatures', 'main', 'character', 'Layfon', 'Alseif', 'who', 'mysterious', 'new', 'comer', 'apparently', 'first', 'tries', 'stay', 'civilian', 'sector', 'cities', 'due', 'fight', 'becoming', 'involved', 'young', 'girl', 'get', 'hurt', 'reveals', 'incredible', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'city', 'who', 'trick', 'fighting', 'protect', 'city', 'series', 'show', 'more', 'Layfon', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'reasoning', 'leaving', 'former', 'mobile', 'city', 'home', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'are', 'pretty', 'stereotypical', 'many', 'anime', 'series', 'too', 'course', 'love', 'triangle', 'Layfon', 'usual', 'gaggle', 'females', 'trying', 'capture', 'heart', 'competing', 'other', 'scenes', 'being', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'well', 'together', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'cast', 'were', 'picked', 'pretty', 'well', 'character', 'roles', 'too', 'previous', 'other', 'two', 'releases', 'Funimation', 'set', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'set', 'two', 'thinpack', 'dvd', 'case', 'put', 'sturdy', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'limited', 'edition', 'giving', 'city', 'Zuellni', 'mini-cloth', 'flag', 'keep', 'second', 'part', 'just', 'two', 'dvds', 'put', 'two', 'thinpack', 'dvd', 'case', 'inserted', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'so', 'like', 'standard', 'fighting', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
