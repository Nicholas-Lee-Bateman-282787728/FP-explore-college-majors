A varied group on individuals, we discover them slowly as the movie progresses.

1395821,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004C45AX2,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Watching `The Way Back' the other night, I found myself baffled that it wasn't wholly embraced by The Academy.  I know that the Oscar campaign was basically nonexistent, and that itself makes me scratch my head, but the buzz surrounding this film and the big names attached (Ed Harris, Peter Weir, Colin Farrell) should have caught the attention of Academy voters, not to mention the fact that the subject matter is Oscar bait personified.  In the beginning of the Oscar year, 2010, I was certain that `The Way Back' was going to nab nominations for Picture, Director, Screenplay and a win for Ed Harris.None of that happened.Now that I've seen the film, I confidently feel that Jim Sturgess would have become an Oscar nominee had this film received a better campaign.`The Way Back' pertains to a journey a group of POW escapees make from a Siberian labor camp on through the Himalayas and into India during the 1940's.  The group is a multinational group, led by a Polish prisoner, Janusz, who was turned over by his wife after being accused of being a political spy.  The group grows and then narrows as stragglers tag along and members die off, but in the end this powerful story of survival will rest heavily on your heart.But, maybe it is the allegations surrounding the film's authenticity (of the story's authenticity I should say) that caused it to fare poorly with Oscar.  Being toted for so long as an actual occurrence, the source material for the film (`The Long Walk', written by Slawomir Rawicz) has been proven falsified.  So, with claims as being `inspired by actual events', `The Way Back' could be seen as unfathomable and misleading.  That is no fault of the film, which was filmed with such precise forethought.  Weir now considers this a mainly fictional work, and seen as such the film really can be appreciated for what it is.Earnest and intelligent.The performances here are collectively great.  Colin Farrell is outstanding, proving once again that he has more than one trick and can pull off nearly anything thrown his way.  Ed Harris is somber and controlled.  I love a subtle performer, but I often find Harris more `dull' than subtle.  Here he balances his performance to feel authenticated and natural.  I just LOVE Saoirse Ronan and think that she is going to continue to slay every performance she gives.  She is just impeccable.  Jim Sturgess really blew me away.  He is a young and fairly unknown actor and yet he commanded the screen and really took the reins of this performance and steered the film where he wanted it to go.  His emotional connection, accent work and physical demeanor were perfection.  Like I said, a better campaign and he would have easily taken Jeff Bridges' nomination.In the end, the film isn't without fault.  Like some critics have mentioned, the film feels slightly cold at times, and the film can seem rather endless despite the fact that the running time is barely over two hours.  Because of the films subject, it can seem slightly redundant, but I felt that Weir combated that with interesting character development and nicely placed dialog that helped keep you interested in what you were watching.  The final scene is heartbreaking, if not a tad clich&eacute;d, and it works well; although I kind of hated the collage of `information' leading up to it; especially with the feet walking all over the screen.Despite the fact that the event depicted in this film most likely DIDN'T happen, this is still a heroic tale that is wonderfully acted and sharply directed and certainly a MUST SEE for everyone.",4,An Oscar shoe in gets Oscar's boot...,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,3569,"['Watching', 'Way', 'Back', 'other', 'night', 'found', 'baffled', 'was', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'embraced', 'Academy', 'know', 'Oscar', 'campaign', 'was', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'scratch', 'head', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'film', 'big', 'names', 'attached', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'should', 'have', 'caught', 'attention', 'Academy', 'voters', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'subject', 'matter', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'personified', 'beginning', 'Oscar', 'year', '2010', 'was', 'certain', 'Way', 'Back', 'was', 'going', 'nab', 'nominations', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Screenplay', 'win', 'Ed', 'Harris.None', 'happened.Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'confidently', 'feel', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'had', 'film', 'received', 'better', 'campaign.', 'Way', 'Back', 'pertains', 'journey', 'group', 'POW', 'escapees', 'make', 'Siberian', 'labor', 'camp', 'Himalayas', 'India', '1940', 'group', 'multinational', 'group', 'led', 'Polish', 'prisoner', 'Janusz', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'over', 'wife', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'political', 'spy', 'group', 'then', 'stragglers', 'tag', 'along', 'members', 'die', 'off', 'end', 'powerful', 'story', 'survival', 'will', 'rest', 'heavily', 'heart.But', 'maybe', 'allegations', 'surrounding', 'film', 'authenticity', 'story', 'authenticity', 'should', 'say', 'caused', 'fare', 'poorly', 'Oscar', 'Being', 'toted', 'so', 'long', 'actual', 'occurrence', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'Long', 'Walk', 'written', 'Slawomir', 'Rawicz', 'been', 'proven', 'falsified', 'So', 'claims', 'being', 'inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'Way', 'Back', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'unfathomable', 'misleading', 'fault', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'such', 'precise', 'forethought', 'Weir', 'now', 'mainly', 'fictional', 'work', 'seen', 'such', 'film', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'what', 'is.Earnest', 'intelligent.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'collectively', 'great', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'outstanding', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'more', 'one', 'trick', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'nearly', 'anything', 'thrown', 'way', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'somber', 'controlled', 'love', 'subtle', 'performer', 'often', 'find', 'Harris', 'more', 'dull', 'subtle', 'Here', 'performance', 'feel', 'authenticated', 'natural', 'just', 'LOVE', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'think', 'going', 'continue', 'slay', 'performance', 'just', 'impeccable', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'young', 'fairly', 'unknown', 'actor', 'yet', 'commanded', 'screen', 'really', 'took', 'reins', 'performance', 'steered', 'film', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'emotional', 'connection', 'accent', 'work', 'physical', 'demeanor', 'were', 'perfection', 'said', 'better', 'campaign', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'nomination.In', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'fault', 'critics', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'feels', 'slightly', 'cold', 'times', 'film', 'can', 'seem', 'rather', 'endless', 'fact', 'running', 'time', 'barely', 'two', 'hours', 'films', 'subject', 'can', 'seem', 'slightly', 'redundant', 'felt', 'Weir', 'combated', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'nicely', 'placed', 'dialog', 'helped', 'keep', 'interested', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'final', 'scene', 'heartbreaking', 'not', 'tad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'well', 'kind', 'hated', 'collage', 'information', 'leading', 'up', 'especially', 'feet', 'walking', 'screen.Despite', 'fact', 'event', 'depicted', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'happen', 'still', 'heroic', 'tale', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'sharply', 'directed', 'certainly', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'everyone']",N/A

1395823,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B004C45AX2,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","THE WAY BACK (USA/United Arab Emirates-2010) is based on an actual event: the WWII escape of six men from a Siberian gulag. They cut through a barbed wire fence during a blizzard and head south toward a large lake and the Mongolian border, both some 300 miles away. Struggling through dense forest and 40 below temperatures with very little food on hand, they barely make it.At the lake, where they're able to catch fish and grow healthy again, the men meet up with a young teen girl who escaped from a collective workhouse. The seven set out for Mongolia, but once at the border they're confronted by a placard with a red star and Stalin's likeness on it, an indication this country won't be welcoming to escapees of Soviet captivity. Six of them press on for Tibet across the deadly Gobi desert; one remains in Siberia. Now they must endure a broiling sun, no shade or water and a massive sandstorm.Two more die. In Tibet, they have to traverse the Himalayas. Ultimately, three make it to India after walking 4,000 miles across some of the harshest places on Earth. It's an incredible story of tenacity against the longest of odds.Ed Harris (as an American arrested in Moscow at war's outbreak) and Colin Farrell (a Russian street thief) are part of the fine international cast. Farrell is exceptional. He brings subtlety to a character that could easily have been a caricature.

The current trends of action and special effects movies is what brings fast cash to the studios and apparently guides de tastes of the young moviegoers. So, when a grandiose and precious film like ""The Way Back"" gets made, my faith in artsy, old-fashioned filmmaking is partially restored.The film begins in 1940, when Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is being interrogated and accused of sabotage and spying activities. He is sent to a Siberian Gulag, in which prisoners are told that ""if nature doesn't kill you, the locals will"" and where ""kindness... that can kill you."" It is a brutal environment, especially if, like Janusz, you are unfortunately condemned to be there for 20 years. It is miserably cold, the food is bad, and you either work in the mines or at the lumber mill - the mines being the worst. So it is a blessing that Janusz meets the right people to escape with him from that hell. He is joined by six other men, including Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) and Valka (Colin Farrell), and successfully makes it out of that inferno. However, as they try to get away and enjoy their freedom, they find out that almost every country that they walk through is also communist, which means that, if captured, they would probably go back to the Gulag. In addition, they have to fight extreme cold and hot temperatures, and lack of food and shelter. Their journey to freedom is costly, and it is truly a test of endurance and trust -- some of the escapees, like Valka, are criminals, and you can't really trust them. On the other hand, it is fun to watch Farrell play a bad guy. Along the way, as you might expect, some of them will perish.""The Way Back"" was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' ""The Long Walk,"" and it was helmed by experienced director Peter Weir, who was also responsible for such majestic movies as ""Master and Commander"" (2003) and ""The Mosquito Coast"" (1986). This is a true inspiring and absorbing film about three men that ""in 1941 walked out of the Himalayas into India"" and ""survived a 4000 miles walk to freedom."" Also, as you can imagine, the cinematography by Russell Boyd is enormously captivating. The Blu-ray edition includes a making-of documentary and the trailer.

The movie takes us to the heart of life in Stalin's Gulags in the frigid fields of Siberia, where the inmates--common men of various nationalities-- have only one goal: warding off death that lurks everywhere.Life here is dependent on the whim of nature and of man. If the sudden blizzard or the poisonous fumes in the mines do not snuff out a few lives every now and then, the slight provocation of the gun toting guards will. Trapped in the thicket of uncertainty, a motley group of determined men join hands in an ambitious plan to jump the bulwark of man and nature.Survival, for them, is a protest against the oppression, and escape a victory over the oppressor. The escapees differ greatly from each other in their origin, vocation and attitude; but they are united in their resolve.Polished and kind hearted Janusz acts as a perfect foil to the murderous thug, Valka. Mr Smith, the staid, no-nonsense American brave-heart counterbalances the soft and artistic Tomasz. Despite the apparent differences all have one thing in common: their painful past, which gives resonance to their resolve.The way forward is as dreadful and treacherous as it was in the Gulag. Dangers and pain, in all imaginable forms, present themselves, but the band overcomes them one by one, through despair, doubt, sickness and even death. The joining of comely Irena, an escapee from a collective farm, brings some freshness to the worn out group.As the wanderers traverse the most strenuous terrains, the movie presents some breathtaking vistas of the wondrous nature as the backdrop. These panoramas bring to mind the documentaries of National Geographic, and as the long shots of the travelers marching against these large canvases come in quick succession, they look formulaic.`The Way Back' has a grim narrative, with surfeit of dread, despair, depravity and death. Even the jokes of the `joker' of the pack fall flat on the face of the somber proceedings. The episode of mosquito attack and finding of its remedy was the only effective comedy in the whole movie by my reckoning.Members of the group die or leave the party. But the opening revelation about how many of them made it to freedom, acts as a big spoiler to the movie. The viewer's interest and anxiety begin to diminish after the declared number is reached.Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'",5,A Grim Odyssey,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,2501,"['Way', 'Back', 'saga', 'triumph', 'human', 'will', 'oppression', 'sketched', 'backdrop', 'harsh', 'threatening', 'yet', 'breathtaking', 'life', 'sustaining', 'movie', 'heart', 'life', 'Stalin', 'Gulags', 'frigid', 'fields', 'Siberia', 'where', 'inmates', 'common', 'men', 'various', 'nationalities', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'goal', 'warding', 'off', 'death', 'everywhere.Life', 'here', 'dependent', 'whim', 'nature', 'man', 'sudden', 'blizzard', 'poisonous', 'fumes', 'mines', 'do', 'not', 'snuff', 'out', 'few', 'lives', 'now', 'then', 'slight', 'provocation', 'gun', 'toting', 'guards', 'will', 'Trapped', 'thicket', 'uncertainty', 'motley', 'group', 'determined', 'men', 'join', 'hands', 'ambitious', 'plan', 'jump', 'bulwark', 'man', 'nature.Survival', 'protest', 'oppression', 'escape', 'victory', 'oppressor', 'escapees', 'differ', 'greatly', 'other', 'origin', 'vocation', 'attitude', 'are', 'united', 'resolve.Polished', 'kind', 'hearted', 'Janusz', 'acts', 'perfect', 'foil', 'murderous', 'thug', 'Valka', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'staid', 'no-nonsense', 'American', 'brave-heart', 'counterbalances', 'soft', 'artistic', 'Tomasz', 'apparent', 'differences', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'painful', 'past', 'resonance', 'resolve.The', 'way', 'forward', 'dreadful', 'treacherous', 'was', 'Gulag', 'Dangers', 'pain', 'imaginable', 'forms', 'present', 'band', 'one', 'one', 'despair', 'doubt', 'sickness', 'even', 'death', 'joining', 'comely', 'Irena', 'escapee', 'collective', 'farm', 'freshness', 'worn', 'out', 'group.As', 'wanderers', 'traverse', 'most', 'strenuous', 'terrains', 'movie', 'breathtaking', 'vistas', 'wondrous', 'nature', 'backdrop', 'panoramas', 'bring', 'mind', 'documentaries', 'National', 'Geographic', 'long', 'shots', 'travelers', 'marching', 'large', 'canvases', 'come', 'quick', 'succession', 'look', 'formulaic.', 'Way', 'Back', 'grim', 'narrative', 'surfeit', 'dread', 'despair', 'depravity', 'death', 'Even', 'jokes', 'joker', 'pack', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'somber', 'proceedings', 'episode', 'mosquito', 'attack', 'finding', 'remedy', 'was', 'only', 'effective', 'comedy', 'whole', 'movie', 'reckoning.Members', 'group', 'die', 'leave', 'party', 'opening', 'revelation', 'how', 'many', 'made', 'freedom', 'big', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'viewer', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'begin', 'diminish', 'declared', 'number', 'reached.Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', ""'Hits"", 'Misses']",N/A
1395852,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004C45AX2,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 21]","""The Way Back"" is said to be about gulag escapees who, during World War II, trekked to freedom on a 4,000 mile journey from Siberia to India. I'm well aware that there are many true stories from that time about the triumph of the human spirit, but this particular story seems utterly impossible to me. Maybe it's because the film is based on an autobiographical book that has, for all intents and purposes, been debunked. Or maybe it's because director Peter Weir has flip flopped on the issue, on the one hand stating that the film is essentially fictional while on the other hand dedicating the film to those who made that journey. Then again, it could be something as simple as the way the film was written and shot. Whatever the case, this is one of the few World War II films that truly does seem like a work of fiction.At the start of the film, a Polish POW named Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is sentenced to twenty years in the gulag after his wife was forced into signing papers implicating him as a foreign spy. Once there, the film's language barrier is conveniently dropped, at which point he meets a number of critical characters. They include a Russian gangster named Valka (Colin Farrell), a cynical Yugoslavian accountant named Zoran (Drago' Bucur), a Latvian priest named Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd), an artist named Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), and a young pole suffering from night blindness named Kazik (Sebastian Urzendowsky). The most important is an American known only as Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), who now believes that kindness can get you killed.An actor named Khabarov (Mark Strong) convinces Janusz that escape from the gulag is possible, despite warnings that the surrounding Siberian wilderness is unforgiving. They plot to hoard as much food as they can until the end of the winter, at which point they will go south towards Lake Baikal and eventually cross the border of Mongolia. Janusz eventually escapes with all the inmates listed above - with the notable exception of Khabarov, who was in fact preying on Janusz's youth and strength to boost his own morale in the gulag. Valka insists on tagging along so as to escape reparations for gambling debts. Mr. Smith decides that Janusz's weakness, his kindness, may prove beneficial. Who else but a kind person would carry someone should they be unable to walk?So begins their harrowing journey, one that will take them from the snows of Siberia to the forests edging Lake Baikal to the Gobi Desert to a ruined monastery in Tibet to the Himalayas, the latter because it eventually becomes clear that India is the safest country for them. Along the way, they pick up an orphaned Polish girl named Irena (Saoirse Ronan), who's on the run and depends on the fugitives to take her to safety. They will all endure starvation, dehydration, heat, cold, and exhaustion. And, of course, not all of them are likely to survive.Part of the problem is that the characters are little more than tiresome escapee stereotypes - broadly developed, simple minded, and always with the talk of their hopes and dreams. This occasionally allows for moments of unnecessary humor, as when Tomasz describes at length his recipe for seasoned chicken. Mr. Smith is probably the most complex character, but even then, he's only at the service of the film's message, namely that one cannot continue in life without forgiving themselves first. This is where Irena comes in; aside from using her youth and femininity to melt Smith's heart, she serves no real purpose to the story; this will prove problematic when he allows himself to feel long before the film has come to end.Another problem is a confusing and unconvincing depiction of distance and time. There are long passages in the Siberian forest and Gobi Desert, but as soon as the characters reach the Himalayas, it's as if someone pressed the fast forward button; no more time is spent on their travelling, so we must assume that, after thousands of miles and stretches with little to no food or water, they suddenly have the strength to go from one side of the mountain range to the other. Never mind the thin air or the freezing temperatures.The film is based on ""The Long Walk,"" a book in which Slawomir Rawicz recalls his experiences escaping from Siberia to India entirely on foot. This is interesting because in 2006, the BBC released a report based on Soviet records, some supposedly written by Rawicz himself; it stated that Rawicz was actually released as part of the USSR's amnesty of Poles in 1942. It also stated that, rather than walking to India, he was transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran. Further complicating matters is a Polish World War II veteran named Witold Gli'ski, who in 2009 claimed that Rawicz's experiences were in fact his own. This too has been questioned. With so much confusion over something as basic as the truth, it's no wonder ""The Way Back"" is one of the least satisfying war movies of recent memory.",3,The Journey of a Thousand Miles Must Begin

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[348, 359]","""The Way Back"" is a masterpiece, a must-see film for thinking people and for lovers of cinema as a serious art form. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film, and was stifling tears. I could not resist applauding at the end. I couldn't wait to discuss it with friends. Several hours after I left the theater, I kept seeing everything - a meaty sandwich, clean water flowing from the tap - through the prism of ""The Way Back."" I'm a long-time fan of director Peter Weir, who gave us classics like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Witness"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Weir has outdone himself.""The Way Back"" depicts a long walk that Gulag escapees took from Siberia to India. I've been lucky enough, under luckier circumstances, to travel some of the world the film references, from Poland to the Himalaya. The film's authenticity in language, costume, even hairstyles, swept me up into its world.Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia attacked Poland in September, 1939, thus beginning World War Two. At first, the Communists killed and deported more people even than the genocidal Nazis. Over a million Poles were deported in cattle cars. Many died; many never returned. No one knows exact numbers. Many struggled to return home, traveling on foot through Eurasia, making shorter treks comparable to that depicted in ""The Way Back;"" I've met such people.Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a young Pole falsely accused by Soviets. His wife is tortured to force a confession. Without ceremony, he is shipped to hellish Siberian concentration camps and mines. Janusz determines to escape, with a ragtag, multilingual crew of followers.Janusz is not particularly handsome, or muscular, or super intelligent. He doesn't have a commanding voice or swagger. His potentially fatal flaw, in this environment, is kindness. Jim Sturgess' Janusz is one of the best aspects of the film. In real life, true leaders usually are not like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Janusz grew up in the woods, and knows how to jerry-rig a compass to point his group south, and a mask to survive blizzards. In the world of Gulag escapees, that's enough to make him the big man. Indeed, Valka, (Colin Farrell), a very tough gangster, declares, or diagnoses, that Janusz is the leader, the man whom the other escapees must obey, both for their own individual benefit and the benefit of group survival.Prison escapees traveling thousands of miles of the Eurasian landmass with minimal gear face multiple dangers, from malnutrition-caused blindness to mosquitoes to snakes to dehydration. Some succumb, and die en route. You can't help but bet the same horrible game of chance that Valka proposes: who will die next? And will his meat be tender - that is, will we resort to cannibalism? A crew member falls. Surviving companions, in stunning testimony to their own humanity, take the time, burn the calories, devote the effort, to fashioning makeshift graves, and funerals. And then they march on.What looks very beautiful on a calendar - an unspoiled mountain forest of snow-dusted evergreens - is actually all but an execution chamber for a hungry fugitive with no tools and only rags for shoes. The last thing a good man sees after making the simple mistake of walking too far with a limited light source will not be a breathtaking natural vista but a comforting, wrenching, hallucination of home.Weir's best choice as a filmmaker here was simply to get out of the story's way. ""The Way Back"" does not want to be your best friend. Weir makes no attempt to cozy up to the viewer, to sweeten the story with phony warmth or touching crescendos. Weir makes no attempt to juice the action with cinematic steroids. For much of the film, the viewer is watching one grueling step after another.Guess what? This is what it's like to suffer for a goal, this is what it's like to be crushed, this is what it's like, purely by chance - not because you are a better person or because God likes you more - to survive. You go on, hour after hour after seemingly pointless hour toward your questionable, impossible objective. This film is an endurance test. It will separate the men from the boys. Folks who think a movie about fantasy, sexy ballerinas is ""great"" filmmaking, and who think that temporarily losing their cell phone service is a human rights violation, will probably walk right out of ""The Way Back.""Characterizations come slowly and are not forced. We discover, in a ruined monastery, that one character had been a priest. We discover that a girl can get taciturn men to talk. Characters speak of food, as hungry people do. ""Add more salt!"" to a fantasy meal, one begs. Valka makes a decision that caused this viewer to cry. I never thought the film could make me care about this murderous thug, but it did. There is inevitable, and surprising, laughter, also not forced, but integral to the circumstances.There are moments of high drama. The men must fight wolves. Weir could have lavished lengthy close-ups on those sharp teeth, snarling snouts and prickly pelts. He doesn't. The wolves are onscreen only long enough to establish what they are and what they are up to. And then the next deadly and impossible challenge rolls down the shoot at the viewer, just as it did for those who took this long walk, and the millions of other humans like them, who have survived life and death challenges under impossible conditions. ""The Way Back"" is, like those poignant grave-markers the marchers make en route, testimony to those who have lived anonymous and agonizing lives in this pitiless world. If you don't think about the big questions while watching this film, and if you're not grateful to the film for that, you don't deserve it.",5,A Masterpiece.

We just don't see films this wonderfully and carefully constructed anymore, and the narrative is such that audiences turned off by the usual Hollywood idioms could very easily find something to love in this one. Debate rages over the authenticity of the story which inspired the film, but it's presented in such harrowing, lush fashion that one can't help but become invested.

1395888,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B004C45AX2,dv_forever,"[61, 65]","I won't wade into the controversy regarding the facts behind the story of this film. Just how true the story is and to whom it actually occurred won't be my focus. I'll write about the filmmaking itself. Peter Weir's entire career has been focused on this singular theme, man at battle with his environment. From the early day of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" to ""The Mosquito Coast"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Master and Commander""... the same theme dominates his expression as a filmmaker. ""The Way Back"" was the perfect vehicle for him to explore this territory once again. He gets to film everything from wintry landscapes of Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, to the Himalaya in China and even a little of India.The cinematography is suitably sumptuous but in no way artificially gorgeous. There is bleakness as well as beauty in the images. The story and characters take second place to the forces of nature. This might be the lethal ingredient to many viewers and their potential engagement with this film. The main character Janusz has a back story and a character arc, but the others are fuzzily sketched. The talents of Ed Harris are mostly wasted but I suppose it's better to have him more in the background instead of how Harris typically dominates his movies with his shouting and lapses into anger. I thought Colin Farrell was miscast as a Russian criminal who provides a bit of comic mischief but the young Saoirse Ronan makes an impression as the lost young girl.The main message of this film apart from the man versus nature dynamic is the idea that it's better to die a free man than live as a prisoner. Imagine having a sentence in one of those Siberian prisons. Making a break for it even with the high chance of death is preferable in my mind to a dull life of drudgery in this far off prison. Better to die in an icy forest or the rain starved desert die than working in a coal mine against your will. I wouldn't rank ""The Way Back"" as one of Peter Weir's best films but it's a respectable effort nonetheless, more worthy of a cinemagoer's time and money than a lot of content in theatrical release right now.",4,Director Peter Weir is in his personal element once again,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2122,"['wo', ""n't"", 'wade', 'controversy', 'regarding', 'facts', 'story', 'film', 'Just', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'whom', 'actually', 'occurred', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'focus', ""'ll"", 'write', 'filmmaking', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'entire', 'career', 'been', 'focused', 'singular', 'theme', 'man', 'battle', 'environment', 'early', 'day', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Master', 'Commander', 'same', 'theme', 'expression', 'filmmaker', 'Way', 'Back', 'was', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'explore', 'territory', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'everything', 'wintry', 'landscapes', 'Siberia', 'deserts', 'Mongolia', 'Himalaya', 'China', 'even', 'little', 'India.The', 'cinematography', 'suitably', 'sumptuous', 'way', 'artificially', 'gorgeous', 'bleakness', 'as', 'well', 'beauty', 'images', 'story', 'characters', 'take', 'second', 'place', 'forces', 'nature', 'might', 'be', 'lethal', 'ingredient', 'many', 'viewers', 'potential', 'engagement', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Janusz', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'arc', 'others', 'are', 'fuzzily', 'sketched', 'talents', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'are', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'suppose', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'background', 'instead', 'how', 'Harris', 'typically', 'movies', 'shouting', 'anger', 'thought', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'was', 'miscast', 'Russian', 'criminal', 'who', 'bit', 'comic', 'mischief', 'young', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'impression', 'lost', 'young', 'girl.The', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'apart', 'man', 'nature', 'dynamic', 'idea', 'better', 'die', 'free', 'man', 'live', 'prisoner', 'Imagine', 'having', 'sentence', 'one', 'Siberian', 'prisons', 'Making', 'break', 'even', 'high', 'chance', 'death', 'preferable', 'mind', 'dull', 'life', 'drudgery', 'far', 'prison', 'Better', 'die', 'icy', 'forest', 'rain', 'starved', 'desert', 'die', 'working', 'coal', 'mine', 'will', 'would', ""n't"", 'rank', 'Way', 'Back', 'one', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'best', 'films', 'respectable', 'effort', 'nonetheless', 'more', 'worthy', 'cinemagoer', 'time', 'money', 'lot', 'content', 'theatrical', 'release', 'right', 'now']",N/A

So when I heard Peter Weir was basing a film on the story I knew I'd have to see it - even if I've waited till DVD.The result is an engaging and visually impressive, if ultimately flawed, work.The most striking thing is its cinematography. It's no wonder that THE WAY BACK was part funded by National Geographic. There are some beautiful landscape shots photographed by Russell Boyd, with director Weir referencing everything from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA to his own GALLIPOLI. It's not just landscapes, however - elsewhere there are other striking images, such as the snow masks cut from wood.It's also an exhausting film. The pace is often elegiac and as the characters walk from Siberia to India, this viewer felt worn to her joints (especially in the gruelling desert scene). It's hard to imagine that human beings could endure such privitations. The result is deeply absorbing; I felt drawn into the narrativeNevertheless, the film does have its faults. Ed Harris and Jim Sturgess are both watchable but the supporting cast are not well drawn enough. I didn't even know their names, a problem exacerbated by their physical similarities. I also felt the film was let down by the ending which is weak and rather unsatisfying.

A small band of prisoners, (including Colin Farrel and Ed Harris) in a Siberian prison camp, manage to escape and figure to make their way to Mongolia and freedom. When they get to Mongolia they find out it is also under Communist control and change their plans to hoof it all the way to India. It's a trek of 4,000 miles through the Gobi desert and over the Himalayan mountains. No easy trick.This is a sprawling epic type film, the likes of which you don't see much these days. While I was viewing it I couldn't help but imagine what a tough shoot it must have been. Bone cracking cold. Mountains. Suffocatingly hot deserts. Rain. This couldn't have been very pleasant, but neither is the story. These guys (and one girl) had to endure a huge distance over generally inhospitable terrain. They starved for days on end and went with little or no water much of the time. The few times they found sufficient food or water, or weather that wasn't killing them, were as much a relief to me as it must have been to them.This flick was shot really well. The camera work and use of location were astounding. The music score was varied and great. The make-up was great as well. Seeing the characters with wind or sun burn made me queezy. The characters were drawn with varying degrees of depth but none struck me as being two dimensional. The performances, particularly Colin Farrel's, were top shelf. This is nearly a perfect movie.

Put simply, this well-executed film based on the memoir by Red Army imprisoned Slavomir Rawicz is very much reminiscent of ""As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me"" (see my review), but follows a group of Soviet labor camp escapees rather than a single individual, and so much of the plot involves relationships within the band rather than the individual psychological hardships depicted in the earlier film. Some of the melodrama that surfaces in the earlier film is also absent here, although I was not particularly fond of the roles played by actors such as Colin Farrell and Ed Harris, who presumably were cast to appeal to a broader viewer audience, although if doing so prompts more interest in this story it was probably worth the sacrifice. As I mentioned in my other review, the scenes of Soviet labor camp survivors traveling through the Siberian wilderness caused me to ponder the plight of the Donauschwabens in my own immediate family (descendants of Germans who had immigrated to an area that was later Yugoslavia, far removed from the political climate of the time who shared similar fates following the war due to their ethnicity), and the last segment of this film, involving some of the best closing scenes of all time, will be especially emotional to anyone who shares such a similar family history, and is one of the many reasons I will proselytize ""The Way Back"".",5,As far as our feet will carry us,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,1692,"['Now', 'films', 'Soviet', 'injustices', 'following', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'are', 'finally', 'starting', 'trickle', 'public', 'consciousness', 'following', 'decades', 'films', 'solely', 'concentrating', 'Axis', 'powers', 'fulfilling', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'created', 'English', 'who', 'shy', 'away', 'subtitled', 'efforts', 'Put', 'simply', 'well-executed', 'film', 'based', 'memoir', 'Red', 'Army', 'imprisoned', 'Slavomir', 'Rawicz', 'very', 'much', 'reminiscent', 'As', 'Far', 'My', 'Feet', 'Will', 'Carry', 'Me', 'see', 'review', 'group', 'Soviet', 'labor', 'camp', 'rather', 'single', 'individual', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'relationships', 'band', 'rather', 'individual', 'psychological', 'hardships', 'depicted', 'earlier', 'film', 'melodrama', 'earlier', 'film', 'also', 'absent', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'roles', 'played', 'actors', 'such', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'presumably', 'were', 'cast', 'appeal', 'broader', 'viewer', 'audience', 'doing', 'so', 'prompts', 'more', 'interest', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'sacrifice', 'mentioned', 'other', 'review', 'scenes', 'Soviet', 'labor', 'camp', 'survivors', 'traveling', 'Siberian', 'wilderness', 'caused', 'ponder', 'plight', 'Donauschwabens', 'own', 'immediate', 'family', 'descendants', 'Germans', 'who', 'had', 'immigrated', 'area', 'was', 'later', 'Yugoslavia', 'far', 'removed', 'political', 'climate', 'time', 'who', 'shared', 'similar', 'fates', 'following', 'war', 'due', 'ethnicity', 'last', 'segment', 'film', 'involving', 'best', 'closing', 'scenes', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'especially', 'emotional', 'anyone', 'who', 'shares', 'similar', 'family', 'history', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'will', 'proselytize', 'Way', 'Back']",N/A

Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of this film. It begins in 1940 'when seven prisoners attempt the impossible: escape from a brutal Siberian gulag. Thus begins a treacherous 4,500-mile trek to freedom across the world's most merciless landscapes. They have little food and few supplies. They don't know or trust each other. But together, they must withstand nature at its most extreme. Their humanity is further tested when they meet a teenage runaway who begs to join them on their quest. A compelling testament to the human spirit, this gripping wilderness adventure is Peter Weir at his hypnotic best', as one critic from the Telluride Festival phrased it.The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith R. Clarke is based on the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" and despite the controversy about the facts as portrayed in this film, this is a human versus nature drama that quietly explodes with an intensity that is at times nearly unbearable, while at other times extraordinary in the manner it shows how men survive the most impossible obstacles. From the beginning of the film in a Soviet Gulag the escapees include a Polish political prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and  American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) who was caught working in Moscow when war broke out, and Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd). During their 4500 mile across the Gulag, Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, the Himalayas in China and into India they encounter a young girl Irena (Saorise Ronan, in an incredibly sophisticated performance), also escaping the Soviet Union, and she becomes part of the survival team.The well-written script allows the human element in all its forms to rise out of the struggle with Nature and thanks to Peter Weir's astute direction and the incredible cinematography of Russell Boyd  the epic is a deeply moving tale.

This movie epitomizes the concept of putting one foot in front of the other and continuing to persevere even amidst the worst possible circumstances to get to the end.  I thought the performance by Ed Harris was really quite good. I often get thrown off somewhat by movies that clearly should be cast and acted in a different language but are in English but I thought that Harris ended up seeming quite genuine as the American imprisoned in the gulag.  I didn't think Colin Ferrell was really quite that good. His acting on the journey was much better than in the gulag but overall it left a bit to be desired for me.  The best though was Dragos Bucur as Zoran, the man who really led them on this journey and was responsible for getting them to the end.  I can see this as a movie that definitely launches him into some other major roles down the road as he has to date been more of a bit actor in my opinion.

Considering this film's big name stars and the fact that it came from the director of Witness and The Dead Poets' Society, it boggles the mind that it would have opened and closed so quickly.  Read no further, is you are concerned about ""spoilers""....As per the Catholic News Service, it is a ""stunning portrayal of a 4,000-mile trek from Siberia to India by escaped political prisoners....'The Long Walk' -- the 1956 book on which [the]...script is based -- was ghostwritten by a British journalist for Slavomir Rawicz, a former Polish cavalry officer. Its tale of Rawicz's heroic 1940 escape from a gulag in the Soviet Union, through snowstorms, across the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas to political asylum on the Indian subcontinent made it a sensation during the height of the Cold War.  The details of the narrative have not held up to fact-checking, however, and there is some evidence -- as reported by the BBC -- that elements of others' escapes may have been woven into a single story, and that Rawicz himself may never, in fact, have fled.  All the same, this is a compelling drama. Its uplifting message about the need for extraordinary solidarity and Christian compassion in the face of every horror man and the wilderness can impose shows the power of a well-crafted epic.""As explained further by Peter Malone, ""The central character is a young Polish patriot who is arrested by the Soviets in 1940, interrogated and denounced by his wife (under torture)....It is...[he] who has to find his way back home - the significant question of the title is the way back to what and to where - to meet his wife again and be reconciled with her. His is a quest for forgiveness and peace. It takes a long time. The film ends with a recapitulation of the Communist decades from the end of the War until the collapse of the Soviet Union and Poland's freedom. Watching the film is not an easy experience but the themes stay with you and are well worth reflecting on.""As per Elizabeth Schiltz, this film is ""bursting with Christian imagery and symbolism -- crowns of thorns, crosses, images of Mary, etc.  The main psychological thread of the movie involves questions of redemption and forgiveness.""Again, this is a masterpiece, and it does not speak well for us that it could have had such a short shelf life in theaters.

1395967,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004C45AX2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","In my household, the arrival of any Peter Weir film is an occasion and let's just say that I've been going thorough a dry spell. You don't even want to know how many of his films rank among my personal favorites! I distinctly recall the relatively limited theatrical release for his latest epic ""The Way Back"" and I found it a bit curious that the film wasn't pushed for Oscar contention due to its subject matter and its scope (it did, in fact, get nominated in the make-up category). If any story was ever obvious Oscar bait, it is this one! But as much as I wanted to love this harrowing tale of survival and perseverance, I ended up admiring individual elements of the film as opposed to embracing it in its entirety. Make no mistake, on subject matter alone--there will be viewers ready to proclaim this to masterpiece status. But while this well meaning film is beautiful to look at (the Blu-ray imagery is terrific), it takes too long to establish its principles as genuine three dimensional characters. And in a tale of human survival, characterizations have to be a top priority!With the ""inspired by real events"" proclamation, Weir spins a enormous tale of struggle and determination. Set in 1940, a disparate group of men (including criminals and political prisoners) attempt an escape from a Siberian gulag. The reliable Jim Sturgess plays the lead with Ed Harris and Colin Farrell providing support. Sturgess is a Pole betrayed by his wife (under duress), Harris is an American reeling from the death of his son, and Farrell is a career criminal. Sturgess has an entire group of friends as well--but, in the beginning, they are indistinguishable and interchangeable. A group of seven does eventually escape, but to survive the brutal Siberian landscape--they're going to have to trust one another to endure. The immense storms are beautifully wrought and terrifying, while the picturesque scenes of tranquility along the way are gorgeous. There is no denying that the film is expertly photographed.Fighting exposure, hunger, death, and the elements--the dwindling group is joined by a young refugee girl (Saoirse Ronan). Up until now, some of the characters have barely even registered beyond their assigned roles--the artist and the funny man, for example. But finally, with Ronan, the film starts to dig a little deeper emotionally. Ronan, Harris, and Sturgess finally get a chance to humanize this impressive but distant tale and ""The Way Back"" finds much needed blood. The trek continues unabated into Tibet, than into India, for 4500 miles of misery and endurance. It's a hard story, and not without its casualties, but Weir has fashioned this a tale of human triumph. With some poignant moments along the way, I think this film had the potential to be a heart wrenching and devastatingly experience. But again, while I was moved on occasion--something lacking in the screenplay kept me slightly removed. I wanted to be weeping!The performances are good. Harris, in particular, digs in with gusto. On every technical level, this is a fine piece of movie making. I certainly admired the film's goals, message, and themes. Still, I think the drama would have been better served by more fully exploring the personal stories of its characters at a much sooner point.

This brought back flashbacks of Charri&eacute;re's ""Papillon"" and my rose-colored-shattering introduction to the world of artistic storytelling and filmmaking.It's a hurdle all true movie fans must overcome. A maturation and learning process to appreciate the variety of dramatic biographies like Papillon, which I now presume much, if not all, of the details have been juiced; giving the audience something stronger to engage with and in. I never think, ""Oh yeah, this is exactly how it happened."" It's foolish and naive. Films are inherently fictional depictions. Like paintings, it's what the artist perceives, not what's necessarily there.So goes 'The Way Back', an incredible journey of human survival and endurance. Telling the tale of seven individuals who escaped one of the thousands of unimaginably horrific communist 'gulag' prisons, crossing the frozen Siberian Tundra, the Mongolian Desert, the western wastelands of China, and finally clawing their way over the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet into Free India. A truly epic and jaw-dropping 4,000 mile journey - all on foot with no supplies and only the threadbare lice-infested rags they were issued in the gulag.Would this be more palatable if it were completely true? Of course. But the story that's being told is very moving and deeply felt, regardless.Additionally, you can never go wrong when Ed Harris is in the cast. This coming from a reviewer who can't stand the man in real life - even I appreciate that he's one of the finest actors of my generation. He never fails to deliver and this is no exception. He's so good in so many things it's hard to add to superlatives without succumbing to redundancy. Suffice to say - he's absolutely great... again.Saoirse Ronan is really laying the groundwork that will propel her to unimaginable heights. I've watched her career and skill level exceed every expectation in every production. While talking heads and bloggers were commenting on Lindsay Lohan this and Dakota Fanning that - I've put my all chips on Ronan as becoming the premiere leading actress of her generation.An amazing production and one that reminds me of another ""lost"" HBO film titled ""Gulag"" (1985).

Films of this sort rarely live up to those expectations. THE WAY BACK is not one of those. This is a movie that people should see, people who need to know that the price of freedom isn't cheap.Opening in 1943, we are introduced to Janusz (Jim Sturges) a polish officer who is accused of treason by the Russians. With the help of his wife who was tortured into making the accusations, Janusz is sent to one of the gulags (work camps) in Sibera. The gulags were the Russian equivalent of the death camps the Nazis had but not as well publicized or (as is revealed in the extras on this DVD) recorded as much as the Nazis did their camps.Unwilling to remain in the camp, Janusz makes friends with another prisoner who says there is a way out. Given directions and the smallest of hopes that it can happen, the pair make plans to escape. But at the same time, they realize there is a better chance with greater numbers. They pick up several people in their plan and when the time arrives they stall the camp's generator and head for a weak link in the fence.On the run facing the dangers of the frozen wilderness as well as the possibility of capture by the guards or by people of the area since they have a price on their heads, the group struggles on, keeping off the beaten path and making their way to what they hope is freedom. Among the group are an American who goes by the name of Mister Smith (Ed Harris) and a Russian criminal named Valka (Colin Farrell). Each has their own idiosyncrasies to add to the group, Smith doing his best not to care about anyone and Valka being the tough as nails killer in the group.Their trek takes them across dangerous terrain and they soon feel that they are lost. Setting out on his own to make certain they aren't, Janusz finds the lake they have been searching for and their hopes rise. As they move along the lakeside path, they encounter a young woman named Irena (Saoirse Ronan) who asks to join them. Thinking she will just slow them down they deny her the chance, but she eventually does join.Moving from the snow covered terrain to the warmer climate, the group continues to head south in hopes of finding the trans-Siberian train line. Once there they plan to cross over it and shortly find themselves in Mongolia where they think they will find freedom. Instead they find more difficulties and a reason to move ever forward heading towards the desert and almost certain death. And should they make that the next thing they will encounter will be the Himalayas.The most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it is based on a true story. To watch and then realize this makes it all the more engrossing a film to watch and also a sadder one as well. With each step they take, with each encounter with the harshest items nature can toss their way, you wonder if you would have had the fortitude to do what these men did. You can call it a desire to live, a desire for freedom, stubbornness or just a will to live, but what they achieve is remarkable.Directed by Peter Weir (who did MASTER AND COMMANDER, DEAD POETS SOCIETY, WITNESS and more), the film is placed in the hands of a master. He combines the story of the land and the harshness of it with the tale of men who bond beyond what most do. And at the same time he makes you realize that their hunger for freedom is one they will do anything to satisfy.THE WAY BACK is not a happy go lucky film. It is brutal but not violent, gut wrenching but not gory, sad but filled with a happiness that comes from inside. It covers a wide spectrum of emotions. It also presents some amazing photography of natural scenes most of us are likely to never witness. But in the end it is an inspiring film and one that should be seen. Not backed by one of the major Hollywood studios, the film had a small release. The fact that it is available on DVD rectifies that situation. It gives those who didn't have the opportunity to see the film before a chance to watch it and perhaps appreciate their own freedoms just a little bit more.",4,STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,4207,"['are', 'movies', 'have', 'sense', 'importance', 'feeling', 'prior', 'watching', 'what', 'are', 'witness', 'important', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'Films', 'sort', 'rarely', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'not', 'one', 'movie', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'know', 'price', 'freedom', ""n't"", 'cheap.Opening', '1943', 'are', 'introduced', 'Janusz', 'Jim', 'Sturges', 'polish', 'officer', 'who', 'accused', 'treason', 'Russians', 'help', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'tortured', 'making', 'accusations', 'Janusz', 'sent', 'one', 'gulags', 'work', 'camps', 'Sibera', 'gulags', 'were', 'Russian', 'equivalent', 'death', 'Nazis', 'had', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'publicized', 'revealed', 'extras', 'DVD', 'recorded', 'as', 'much', 'Nazis', 'did', 'camps.Unwilling', 'remain', 'camp', 'Janusz', 'friends', 'prisoner', 'who', 'way', 'Given', 'directions', 'smallest', 'hopes', 'can', 'happen', 'pair', 'make', 'plans', 'escape', 'same', 'time', 'realize', 'better', 'chance', 'greater', 'numbers', 'pick', 'up', 'several', 'people', 'plan', 'when', 'time', 'stall', 'camp', 'generator', 'head', 'weak', 'link', 'fence.On', 'run', 'facing', 'dangers', 'frozen', 'wilderness', 'as', 'well', 'possibility', 'capture', 'guards', 'people', 'area', 'have', 'price', 'heads', 'group', 'keeping', 'off', 'beaten', 'path', 'making', 'way', 'what', 'hope', 'freedom', 'group', 'are', 'American', 'who', 'name', 'Mister', 'Smith', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Russian', 'criminal', 'named', 'Valka', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'own', 'idiosyncrasies', 'add', 'group', 'Smith', 'doing', 'best', 'not', 'care', 'anyone', 'Valka', 'being', 'tough', 'nails', 'killer', 'group.Their', 'trek', 'dangerous', 'terrain', 'soon', 'feel', 'are', 'lost', 'Setting', 'out', 'own', 'make', 'certain', 'are', ""n't"", 'Janusz', 'lake', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'hopes', 'rise', 'move', 'lakeside', 'path', 'encounter', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Irena', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'join', 'Thinking', 'will', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'deny', 'chance', 'eventually', 'join.Moving', 'snow', 'covered', 'terrain', 'warmer', 'climate', 'group', 'head', 'south', 'hopes', 'finding', 'trans-Siberian', 'train', 'line', 'Once', 'plan', 'cross', 'shortly', 'find', 'Mongolia', 'where', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'freedom', 'Instead', 'find', 'more', 'difficulties', 'reason', 'move', 'ever', 'forward', 'heading', 'desert', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'should', 'make', 'next', 'thing', 'will', 'encounter', 'will', 'be', 'Himalayas.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'watch', 'then', 'realize', 'more', 'engrossing', 'film', 'watch', 'also', 'sadder', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'step', 'take', 'encounter', 'harshest', 'items', 'nature', 'can', 'toss', 'way', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'fortitude', 'do', 'what', 'men', 'did', 'can', 'call', 'desire', 'live', 'desire', 'freedom', 'stubbornness', 'just', 'will', 'live', 'what', 'achieve', 'remarkable.Directed', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'who', 'did', 'MASTER', 'AND', 'COMMANDER', 'DEAD', 'POETS', 'SOCIETY', 'WITNESS', 'more', 'film', 'placed', 'hands', 'master', 'story', 'land', 'harshness', 'tale', 'men', 'who', 'bond', 'what', 'most', 'do', 'same', 'time', 'realize', 'hunger', 'freedom', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'satisfy.THE', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'not', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'film', 'brutal', 'not', 'violent', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'not', 'gory', 'sad', 'filled', 'happiness', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'emotions', 'also', 'amazing', 'photography', 'natural', 'scenes', 'most', 'are', 'likely', 'never', 'witness', 'end', 'inspiring', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'Not', 'backed', 'one', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'film', 'had', 'small', 'release', 'fact', 'available', 'DVD', 'rectifies', 'situation', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'film', 'chance', 'watch', 'perhaps', 'appreciate', 'own', 'freedoms', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more']",N/A

1396005,A1FG91CM8221X1,B004C45AX2,Miles D. Moore,"[4, 8]","It is easy to quibble with Peter Weir's ""The Way Back."" We get only thumbnail sketches, not portraits, of the lead characters, and the portion of their journey that you'd think would be the most spectacular--the trek across the Himalayas from Tibet to India--is swallowed up in a single jump cut. And don't even mention the Russian documents that cast considerable doubt on the truthfulness of the movie's source material.Yet for all that, I regard ""The Way Back"" as a four-and-a-half-star movie, and I'm happy to kick in the extra half-star to give it the highest rating. This is because ""The Way Back"" has what very few movies give you--grandeur. And grandeur that is not just scenic, but moral. The film depicts a place that was literally hell on earth--the Gulag under Stalin--and the resilience of the human spirit under the worst conceivable conditions. So what if the story isn't factual? It tells human truths we all know in our bones, and demonstrates once again how the desire for freedom can survive any form of oppression.As in his most recent film, ""Master and Commander,"" Weir in ""The Way Back"" depicts human figures in a landscape too vast to contemplate--in this case, the forests of Siberia and the deserts of Mongolia. In both films, nature is bigger than people, but the very humanity of people is what allows them--some of them, anyway--to endure and triumph. Russell Boyd's photography is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and the performances of Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan are unforgettably vivid. (The others, unfortunately, tend to fade.) I can't help but feel that the late David Lean would approve of this film, which is the highest compliment for any film that aspires to be an epic.

The story of seven prisoners who escape a Siberian labor camp and walk halfway across the world to freedom doesn't reinvent the jailbreak; the characters are tried and true, and a lot of the action is predictable. But somehow the film overcomes its shortcomings and gives us a very watchable and entertaining piece of work.Our somewhat Magnificent Seven represent the gamut of usual suspects: we have a Noble Leader, a joker, a man of mystery, an artist...you know the drill. The best performances are turned in by Colin Farrell as a wily Russian crook, and Ed Harris, a disgrunted American who thought Russia would be an escape from the Depression and a worker Utopia. The rest of the cast is made up of European actors and they handle their roles very well.Seven comrades set on an epic journey, slogging by foot through Russia, across the Gobi Desert, over the Himalays and all the way to India before they find sanctuary. David Weir, the director, provides us with exceptional camera work. No stock shots here, we see the terrain the men have to cross, and it's a frightening, powerful experience. Every time the survivors get past another obstacle, you feel like cheering.  Weir also keeps a tight rein on the performers. No one goes over the top, although you can see how nuch Colin Farrell wants to.Even more interesting than the film, is the story behind it. ""The Way Back"" is based on ""The Long Walk"" by Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish army officer. His memoir of an 11-month trek from Irkutsk to India is a paen to man's strength, determination and love of freedom. And it's a crock. Rawicz eventually admitted he made up the whole escape thing. He got his walking papers in 1942 during a general amnesty.  No Mongolia or China or India...his only goal was Hollywood. But not to worry.  A story like this is too good to abandon.  Several years later, another Polish WWII officer, one Witold Gli&ntilde;ski, suddenly remember he was the guy who hiked to India.  Sad to say, the world has become a cynical place his claims have not been taken seriously.So, if you are still with me and have not set out on foot to cross deserts, swim oceans and traverse ice floes to find me and shut me up, here we are at last, at the end. Okay, not quite the end, but you can see it from here. Honest.

1396047,A1XESQ7C7NNZX4,B004C45AX2,Reviewer,"[5, 6]","""The Way Back"" will be appreciated by anyone genuinely interested in the history of communism and of World War II, anyone whose family were affected by communism or by the War, and anyone who likes to witness victory of the human spirit over the hellish shackles of totalitarian ideology.There has been some knee-jerk dismissive reaction to this magnificent film because it is largely based on abook authored by Slavomir Rawiczwho could not be the actual hero of the Long Walk. There is another survivor of Soviet labor camps Witold Glinski, who later claimed to be the one who successfully made the 4000-mile journey to freedom and whose story Rawicz used for his bestseller.In 1942 a British intelligence officer Rupert Mayne had interviewed three worn-down men in Calcutta - men who had escaped from Siberia and then walked all the way to India. And a Polish engineer living in New Zealand had acted as an interpreter for this very same interview in Calcutta with the wretched survivors. Peter Weir said, ""There was enough for me to say that three men had come out of the Himalayas, and that's how I dedicate my film, to these unknown survivors. And then I proceed with essentially a fictional film.""And so it is a fictional film inspired by real events. And the list of real events is long, including many faithfully presented details of daily life in Gulag camps; how common criminals were always deliberately put together with political prisoners, and the Soviet methods of interrogation were one member of the family would be turned against another (and here I recommend doing a quick Google search about Pavlik Morozov - famous example of Soviet anti-family propaganda for the youth).The very first real event one learns in ""The Way Back"" is that both Germany and Soviet Union started the Second World War in 1939 by their invasion of Poland: Germany on September 1st, and the Soviets on September 17th. Few people know it and few historians like to admit that Hitler and Stalin were allies until 1941. For the Nations of the so-called ""Soviet Block,"" or the so-called ""Eastern Europe,"" or from behind the so-called ""Iron Curtain"" the War did not end in 1945. For those Nations the Second World War ended in 1989 - long after ""the West"" celebrated their ""victory"" and pretty much forgot about the War. Giving all those Nations as a gift to ""Uncle Joe"" (that's what his brand new ""allies"" fondly called Stalin) was part of a deal that he made with Roosevelt and Churchill in February 1945 at the Conference of Yalta.Anyone who was deemed a threat to the Soviet regime would be killed or imprisoned. And so many ended up in concentration camps in Siberia from where practically there was no escape. However there were many documented attempts to escape. Successful escapes often remained unreported because they would give bad reputation to the camp's commanding officers.And here I wholeheartedly recommend reading Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book ""The Gulag Archipelago."" For anyone trying to compare the events from ""The Way Back"" to a weekend trekking in the Rockies, Solzhenitsyn's book will be a true eye-opener and it will make the Long Walk perfectly plausible. Keep in mind that journey was made not to impress a boyfriend or to break a Guinness record, it was done to escape from slavery and death and that's the strongest motivation there is: ""Even when I die escaping, I die a Free Man.""",5,A stunningly beautiful and meaningful film.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[1, 1]","So many films are made about the Holocaust camps and other prison breaks, but I can't recall another film, with one exception, involving the Russian gulags. This made it interesting to me, though Peter Weir's style is often slow and pensive, and not much is shown of gulag life. Maybe someday someone will try to put some of Solzhenitzyn's work to film (aside from ""Ivan Denisovich""). As explained in the generous DVD extras, the Russians didn't keep records as the Nazis did. In effect, once you're in Siberia, bye bye...It's a courageous tale, and more may have been done with some the the characters' back-stories. Jim Stugiss as Janusz is the most complete; Ed Harris is his usual brooding, intense self; the most complex character, played by Colin Ferrell, leaves the film too soon; and the wonderful Saoirse Ronan is on hand to provide further strife and concern.Certainly, a 4000 mile trip, under these circumstances, would involve lots of opportunity for reflection and back-story, which Mr Weir often does well, but the story seemed to plod along as unguided as our heroes. In hindsight, this may have been his purpose.The superb art direction and cinematography are to be commended; re-building a portion of the Great Wall was impressive. I'm sorry it was only Oscar nommed for Make-Up.

1396061,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B004C45AX2,Robin Simmons,"[17, 24]","Peter Weir's epic film, inspired by The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom by Slavomir Rawicz, is a popular story that has embedded itself into the hearts the minds of several generations of readers.  A movie adaptation has been ""in development"" one way or another for over 50 years.  Burt Lancaster was attached as the lead at one time.  As written, the astonishing story is about Cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz who was captured by the Red Army in 1939 during the German-Soviet division of Poland.  Rawicz is sent to the Yakutsk labor camp in the Siberian Gulag along with captive Poles, Finns, Ukrainians, Czechs, Greeks and a few English, French, and Americans.  After a year of extreme hardship, Rawicz and six comrades escape and make their way, on foot, over four thousand miles south to British India, where Rawicz reenlists in the Polish army to fight the Nazis!There has been much controversy about the truth of this popular and inspiring story.  Although the circumstances of the story didn't happen to writer Rawicz, they apparently are based on real events and real individuals.  Peter Weir's movie is old school filmmaking.  Exotic locations and majestic vistas imbue the relatively modest budget ($30m) epic with more than a semblance of authenticity.  Ed Harris is a standout as the mysterious Mister Smith.  His wonderfully weathered, grizzled face matches the sometimes gnarly terrain.  Even with a plethora of walking and talking, this is a journey worth taking.  It is as much about our shared landscape as it is about our collective, indomitable spirit.There is a tedious, repetitive and episodic tone to the film that conveys the nature of the long trek but bogs down the film experience.

They bring to the DVD an accumulated storehouse of wonder, gratitude and thanksgiving.  For them, the film need not be better than it is to have the reading experience enriched and satisfaction delivered.  My review will critique only the film itself without any prior acquaintance with the book.  I come to the film with a clean slate and rate it strictly as cinema.Anyone who's seen a few National Geographic & Michael Palin travel films will pretty much visualize what the trekking part (97%) of this film will contain without buying the DVD. We've seen the majestic & forbidding landscape countless times.  People sharing canteen water and collapsing in the desert sands + ""suspense"" on the order of ""Are those date palms a mirage?"" and the stampede forward --- all are standard fare.  The trek is cliche ridden (as it has to be, given the paucity of possibilities.) and downright ho-hum.  interpersonal dynamics between the trekkers are weak as water.  One can't help feeling as the hours pass that the director is tearing his hair out and will pay any price just to finally get the thing in the can.It's a disservice that the quote that adorns the DVD case is soaring, unqualified and ecstatic.  ""The year's MOST AMAZING and INSPIRING film.""  THE YEAR'S MOST .  .  .  .  ?  And what's ""amazing"" (i.e., unexpected) about the trek we saw?  Everything in there was what we expected the moment we knew mountains, deserts and distances lay ahead.I respect people who genuinely enjoy the low key realities of this film, carried along in an assenting daydream and relieved not to have to watch car chases, drug smuggling, exploding oil trucks and machine gun blasts on the streets.

Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) directs and gives us an inspirational tale of hardship, perseverance, and what it means to be free.I wouldn't normally suggest this, but it's a good idea to skip the first chapter of the film. Those first two minutes and 15 seconds contain two things: a list of credits explaining which studios were responsible for making the film and a brief text-only prologue. The prologue reveals too much of the story. It explains how many people survive the journey, their gender and where they walk to. The film still works, but I think it's better to view it without knowing those details. It was presumably done to pay tribute to those who made the historical journey. You won't miss a single frame of the film if you skip it.The story opens with an interrogation sequence in which a Polish woman is made to inform on her husband, Janusz (Sturgess). He's sent to a Siberian prison camp as a result. The year is 1940; a time when Stalin and Hitler were trying to conquer various parts of Europe.Janusz meets a variety of prisoners, but we aren't told much about their origins. Because of this lack of exposition, it's difficult to tell one prisoner from the other at the start of the film. They dress the same and are similar in appearance. The guards are confident that nobody will escape because Siberia is a snowy wilderness and surviving under those conditions is next to impossible. Janusz wants to try anyway and assembles a group willing to make the attempt.We meet Mr. Smith (Harris), Valka (Farrell), Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgard). The prison scenes are subtitled for the most part, showing us that the party of escapees comes from several nations. It's a brutal existence and one man is killed for his sweater. The escape party trades for what food is available and breaks out of the camp, evading pursuit by armed guards and dogs.The group has a vague plan based on where it thinks the camp is located. Conditions are harsh and blizzards are frequent. There are mountains in every direction. Some of the group hallucinates at times, but six people survive long enough to set off on the journey. After a while, it's clear that they are being followed. It turns out to be Irena, a young Polish girl (Ronan). She claims that her parents are dead and wants to join the group.The remainder of the film is devoted to showing the journey. Terrain varies from freezing snow-covered mountains to open desert. Food and water quickly run out and the group is forced to live off the land. Their footwear isn't up to the task and most of the party has to deal with walking on blistered feet with open wounds. Dialogue is sparse and we never learn much about each character. The story becomes a dour struggle for survival.When the story of the journey is coming to a close, we are shown a montage of historical footage dealing with the collapse of communism. It brings us out of the 1940s and as far as 1989. The final scene is the most uplifting in the film and ties up a loose end.I won't say any more because, as I said at the start of the review, too many details ruin the suspense.Weir's film is well-acted, epic in scope and ambitious. The actors must have had a hard job adjusting to the different conditions as many scenes were shot on location in extreme cold or searing heat. The story deserved to be told. The thing is, the lack of character development doesn't give us much to care about other than the general survival of the group.Video Quality 4.5Russell Boyd's cinematography looks incredible on Blu-ray. Some of the scenes showing mountains or desert dunes are breathtaking. The transfer does justice to the film and detail is good throughout. The opening gulag scenes are deliberately drab and muted, but the brightly-lit scenes during the journey are filled with detail.Audio Quality 5/5The dramatic score sounds wonderful on this DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix, but the highlight is the use of ambient sounds. Whether the scene involves mining, a blizzard or a sandstorm, you'll feel like you are there. More subtle sounds are also evident. While some of the accents are heavy, the track reproduces them clearly.Special Features 2/5With the exception of a theatrical trailer, there's just one feature:The Journey of the Journey (30:57) is a brief account of the problems faced during filming and includes comments from Peter Weir and the principal actors. It was interesting to see how some of the effects were produced, as well as discovering which countries were chosen to depict the ones used in the story. It's well worth a look if you are curious about the film. The low score is for the lack of additional features.There are one or perhaps two characters with enough depth to make us care about them individually. The story held my interest and I admire some of the previous work from Weir and the four main actors, but the film is flawed. The focus is on the journey, but there's not enough background, exposition or character development to fully engage the viewer emotionally.I would suggest this as a rental as its replay value would be limited for some.Overall score 3.5/5",4,A tale of human endurance,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,5627,"['Way', 'Back', 'drama', 'history', 'adventure', 'Directed', 'Peter', 'WeirStarring', 'Ed',

The landscapes in this movie are quite striking but can't overcome the tediously thin plot.Director Peter Weir based this film loosely on The Long Walk by former Polish Army lieutenant, Slavomir Rawicz. Investigations have raised serious doubts whether Rawicz actually made the 4000 mile trek from Siberia to India as he claimed.The only upside to The Way Back is it does focus attention on the little-known deportation of Poles (1.7 million) to the Gulag by the Soviets during the Second World War. Those interested might want to check out a personal account of the deportation, ""When God Looked the Other Way: An Odyssey of War, Exile, and Redemption,"" by Wesley Adamczyk.It was interesting to see actor Ed Harris in this film. You may remember Harris defiantly sat on his hands in protest when director Elia Kazan received an honorary Oscar in 1999. Kazan had quit the American Communist Party in 1936 and subsequently named names in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, becoming forever the scorn of liberals.

He later escapes with other prisoners including an enigmatic American ""Mr. Smith"" (Ed Harris) and a knife-wielding Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell). The only way they can go is south, but that means they have to survive the freezing cold of winter and the sandstorm of the desert.""The Way Back"" is director Peter Weir's first film in seven years (the last being ""Master and Commander"" in 2003). He was not a prolific director, and these days he is making less and less films - ""The Truman Show,"" his last but one film before ""The Way Back"" was made in 1998 - but he hasn't lost his touch. His latest film is long and sometimes feels drawn-out, but because of the interesting characters and the impossible situations they are in, the film remains engrossing. Even those who know something about the controversy over the authenticity of the original book will find the drama gripping.""The Way Back"" benefits greatly from the exquisite on location photography and effective acting from the cast including Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Potocean, Saoirse Ronan, Gustaf Skarsgrd, Mark Strong and Sebastian Urzendowsky.

Based on a true story the film focuses on the atrocities committed by the Soviets during Stalin's reign of terror beginning just prior to World War II. Set in Siberia at one of the Soviet gulags ""The Way Back"" focuses on five political prisoners and one criminal who attempt the impossible; an escape from the gulag and a trek to freedom thousands of miles towards Mongolia. Januscz (Jim Sturgess) a Pole like many political prisoners was convicted on a false accusation of being an enemy of the State. Sentenced to 25 years in gulag building the Trans-Siberian Railway he discovers that many of the prisoners there were sent there on trumped up charges in order to create slave labor in the most inhospitable conditions imaginable. Striking up a cautious friendship with Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) an American engineer who migrated to find work in Russia during the American Depression, Voss (Gustaf Skarsgrd) a priest, Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean) , a criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), a cook with artistic ambitions and Zoran (Dragos Bucur). Januscz plans on escaping North with the help of these individuals when he and others are assigned to the mines where the survival rate is extremely low.These men trek nearly 4000 miles along the way picking up a girl Irena (Saoirses Ronan) who has escaped from a collective farm after her parents were murdered by the Soviets struggling to survive on little to no food and stay out away from any authorities as they try and make their escape to live or die as free men.Weir's tackled a number of genres over the years but the themes to his films remain the same about trying to retain our sense of self in a world knocked out of balance. While ""The Way Back"" manages to be an interesting and compelling film to watch it lacks the emotional resonance that is often at the heart of Weir's films. This is primarily due to the lack of major conflict between the characters or the lack of a challenge to Januscz leadership of this rag tag group of prisoners who all have their own reasons for wanting to escape but too little is shared too late when Irena becomes the main means of communication between these very different men. This isn't a fault of the acting but of the writing and, perhaps, of Weir's direction of the material.""The Way Back"" receives a sharp a nice looking transfer to Blu-ray. Although some of the bleak vistas don't lend themselves to a colorful presentation, the awe inspiring photography still manages to capture the majesty of the vast wilderness that surrounds and often overpowers these men. Skin tones look quite nice throughout and natural. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout with nice depth. The film always looks like a film as well eschewing the overly ""digital"" look of many more recent films with minimal use of digital noise management.Audio likewise can be quite brilliant particularly during scenes set in the ice or snow storms of Siberia. Dialogue remains crisp and clear throughout.""The Journey of the Journey"" is a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. Weir and the various actors are interviewed about the experience of making the film and we get to see plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of the building of the gulag which is evidently quite accurate in detail. The documentary is presented in SD and clocks in just over 30 minutes.We also get the original trailer in standard definition as well.Although a flawed film ""The Walk Back"" is still a worthwhile rental even if it isn't a top notch Weir film.",4,Powerful but flawed epic film from director Peter Weir-Blu-ray looks terrific,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,3605,"['Peter', 'Weir', 'Way', 'Back', 'two', 'extremes', 'film', 'epic', 'film', 'individual', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Soviets', 'Stalin', 'reign', 'terror', 'beginning', 'just', 'prior', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Set', 'Siberia', 'one', 'Soviet', 'Way', 'Back', 'five', 'political', 'prisoners', 'one', 'criminal', 'who', 'impossible', 'escape', 'gulag', 'trek', 'freedom', 'thousands', 'miles', 'towards', 'Mongolia', 'Januscz', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Pole', 'many', 'political', 'prisoners', 'was', 'convicted', 'false', 'accusation', 'being', 'enemy', 'State', 'Sentenced', '25', 'years', 'gulag', 'building', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Railway', 'many', 'prisoners', 'were', 'sent', 'there', 'trumped', 'up', 'charges', 'order', 'create', 'slave', 'labor', 'most', 'inhospitable', 'conditions', 'imaginable', 'Striking', 'up', 'cautious', 'friendship', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'American', 'engineer', 'who', 'migrated', 'find', 'work', 'Russia', 'American', 'Depression', 'Voss', 'Gustaf', 'Skarsgrd', 'priest', 'Tomasz', 'Alexandru', 'Potocean', 'criminal', 'Valka', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'cook', 'artistic', 'ambitions', 'Zoran', 'Dragos', 'Bucur', 'Januscz', 'escaping', 'North', 'help', 'individuals', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'assigned', 'mines', 'where', 'survival', 'rate', 'extremely', 'low.These', 'men', 'trek', 'nearly', '4000', 'miles', 'way', 'picking', 'up', 'girl', 'Irena', 'Saoirses', 'Ronan', 'who', 'escaped', 'collective', 'farm', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', 'Soviets', 'struggling', 'survive', 'little', 'food', 'stay', 'out', 'away', 'authorities', 'try', 'make', 'escape', 'live', 'die', 'free', 'men.Weir', 'tackled', 'number', 'genres', 'years', 'themes', 'films', 'remain', 'same', 'trying', 'retain', 'sense', 'self', 'world', 'knocked', 'balance', 'Way', 'Back', 'be', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'film', 'watch', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'often', 'heart', 'Weir', 'films', 'primarily', 'due', 'lack', 'major', 'conflict', 'characters', 'lack', 'challenge', 'Januscz', 'leadership', 'rag', 'tag', 'group', 'prisoners', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'escape', 'too', 'little', 'shared', 'too', 'late', 'when', 'Irena', 'main', 'means', 'communication', 'very', 'different', 'men', ""n't"", 'fault', 'acting', 'writing', 'perhaps', 'Weir', 'direction', 'material', 'Way', 'Back', 'sharp', 'nice', 'looking', 'transfer', 'Blu-ray', 'bleak', 'vistas', 'do', ""n't"", 'lend', 'colorful', 'presentation', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'photography', 'still', 'capture', 'majesty', 'vast', 'wilderness', 'often', 'men', 'Skin', 'tones', 'look', 'quite', 'nice', 'natural', 'Detail', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'nice', 'depth', 'film', 'always', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'eschewing', 'overly', 'digital', 'look', 'many', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'minimal', 'use', 'digital', 'noise', 'management.Audio', 'likewise', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'set', 'ice', 'snow', 'storms', 'Siberia', 'Dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Journey', 'Journey', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'Weir', 'various', 'actors', 'are', 'interviewed', 'experience', 'making', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'plenty', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'building', 'gulag', 'evidently', 'quite', 'accurate', 'detail', 'documentary', 'presented', 'SD', 'clocks', 'just', '30', 'minutes.We', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'trailer', 'standard', 'definition', 'flawed', 'film', 'Walk', 'Back', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'rental', 'even', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'Weir', 'film']",N/A

The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,"" but not based on it.After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of his book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski. Besides, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in ""The Way Back,"" regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? Absolutely. In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, ""A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.""Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teenaged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.Needless to say, this a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point - the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.The movie drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:- The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion and slander.- Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.- Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America in a formative stage?- Better to die free than live in a gulag or under dictatorial socialistic governments.- No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.- Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.- Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, filmed in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.RUNTIME: 2 hours and 13 minutesFINAL WORD: ""The Way Back"" is a must if you love survival stories like ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" (especially the original version) or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" as well as films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Black Robe"" and ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan."" It's unique but it has the same general tone. Stay away if you have ADHD or solely relish films with conventional Hollywood plotting, not that there's anything wrong with that, lol.GRADE: A",5,Better to die free than live under the shackles of communism,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,3480,"['Way', 'Back', '2010', 'place', 'circa', '1940-41', 'details', 'group', 'mad', 'escape', 'Siberian', 'gulag', 'cold', 'Soviet', 'wilderness', 'Mongolia', 'great', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'mountainous', 'Tibet', 'ultimately', 'freedom', 'India', 'film', 'was', 'inspired', 'Slavomir', 'Rawicz', 'popular', 'book', 'Long', 'Walk', 'True', 'Story', 'Trek', 'Freedom', 'not', 'based', 'it.After', 'records', 'Rawicz', 'release', 'gulag', 'USSR', '1942', 'were', 'unearthed', 'veracity', 'book', 'was', 'called', 'question', 'others', 'suggest', 'circumstances', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'author', 'Rawicz', ""'re"", 'apparently', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'real', 'individuals', 'Polish', 'soldier', 'Witold', 'Glinski', 'Besides', 'light', 'millions', 'prisoners', 'carted', 'away', 'Siberia', 'time', 'period', ""n't"", 'likely', 'handful', 'successfully', 'escaped', 'had', 'experiences', 'similar', 'shown', 'Way', 'Back', 'regardless', 'not', 'made', 'way', 'India', 'Absolutely', 'event', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'plainly', 'stated', 'film', 'largely', 'fictional', 'only', 'inspired', 'book', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'account.The', 'group', 'natural', 'leader', 'Janusz', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'not', 'leadership', 'charisma', 'simply', 'spent', 'life', 'woods', 'KNOWS', 'how', 'survive', 'such', 'environment', 'Solomon', 'said', 'wise', 'man', 'great', 'power', 'man', 'knowledge', 'increases', 'strength', 'Also', 'along', 'haul', 'cynical', 'American', 'called', 'Mister', 'Smith', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Russian', 'hooligan', 'named', 'Valka', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'comic', 'accountant', 'artistic', 'pastry', 'chef', 'priest', 'Pole', 'night', 'blindness', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'named', 'Irena', 'played', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'incidentally', 'celebrated', '16th', 'birthday', 'set.Needless', 'say', 'story', 'survival', 'group', 'freezing', 'nights', 'lack', 'food', 'water', 'bugs', 'death', 'never-ending', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'Himalayas', 'not', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'moral', 'questions', 'arise', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'walking', 'whole', 'point', 'film', '4000-mile', 'escape', 'foot', 'freedom.The', 'movie', 'drives', 'home', 'powerful', 'messages', 'will', 'be', 'pondered', 'well', 'viewing', 'government', 'communistic', 'extreme', 'socialistic', 'states', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'demonic', 'machine', 'will', 'immediately', 'squelch', 'dissidents', 'measure', 'possible', 'including', 'torturous', 'coercion', 'slander.-', 'Such', 'godless', 'governments', 'are', 'vile', 'social', 'infection', 'spreads', 'must', 'be', 'escaped', 'costs.-', 'socialistic', 'disease', 'now', 'spreading', 'America', 'formative', 'stage', 'Better', 'die', 'free', 'live', 'gulag', 'dictatorial', 'socialistic', 'governments.-', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'live', 'gulag.-', 'Mongolians', 'Tibetans', 'are', 'people', 'true', 'honor.-', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'precious', 'young', 'lady.In', 'addition', 'film', 'great', 'score', 'spectacular', 'locations', 'filmed', 'Bulgaria', 'Morocco', 'India.RUNTIME', '2', 'hours', '13', 'minutesFINAL', 'WORD', 'Way', 'Back', 'must', 'love', 'survival', 'stories', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', 'especially', 'original', 'version', 'Sands', 'Kalahari', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Black', 'Robe', 'Mongol', 'Rise', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'unique', 'same', 'general', 'tone', 'Stay', 'away', 'have', 'ADHD', 'solely', 'relish', 'films', 'conventional', 'Hollywood', 'plotting', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'lol.GRADE']",N/A
