1002046,AYF76HQ10BL2J,B000GDH8HE,Hamster Army,"[5, 6]","Ghost Hunters is great TV, and the second season has plenty of great moments.My disappointment lies in the audio department...it's simply flawed to the point of ruining the experience.  The fuzzed-out sound is either extremely low quality, or simply a huge error on the manufacturer's part somehow.  I am just not sure.  All of my discs in both season parts are like this.I am not sure if it is just my copies, or a first batch issue, or what.The video quality is also quite poor, simply very low resolution many times, and they did a poor job of ""lightening up"" evidence films in the show, so that viewers can actually see what they are seeing more clearly.  The St. Augustine Lighthouse evidence reveal comes to mind, as does the experience Jason has in the Stanley Hotel when the door closes in his room.Not nearly enough effort and quality production values were put into this season.  It's honestly bad enough, for someone who is not overly picky about DVD perfection, to want to return or exchange my copies.I'm not sure what sort of huge mistake was made in producing these, but, I hope it is addressed and those that bought early, defective copies, are reimbursed or allowed to exchange.All that said, it is ""watchable"" in it's current form, and the show itself, of course, is excellent.  If you believe in ghosts or not, or the paranormal at large, this show is entertaining, as it focuses strictly on producing sound evidence (audio/visual) versus relying on the thoughts and feeling of others (psychics).No psychics are used!

1002048,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000GDH8HE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[17, 17]","""Ghost Hunters:  Season 2, Part 2,"" is actually composed of episodes from SciFi channel's Season 3.  It includes some very recognizable hotspots such as the Lizzie Borden house, the prison used in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the heavily viewed Willard Library.  Much like the ""Season 2, Part 1"" set, this DVD set suffers from poor audio and grainy video.  With that said, however, Big Vision has remedied the problem they had with the first season's DVD set, which was that the DVD's came loose during shipping or the case was easily damaged from the factory to the front door of the customer.  The new cases that are used for Season 2 are wonderful, and seem to have been developed by the guys who came up with childproof medicine bottles.The shows are wonderful to watch, especially the St. Augustine Lighthouse episode in which the TAPS team comes up with some amazing evidence.  I'm always impressed with the professionalism and seriousness exuded by the TAPS squad.  Sure, the team often bickers over things too much, but it's due to this bickering that they come up with such strong evidence.  I've always pictured the team's founders, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, as a good cop/bad cop duo.  Grant seems to be the quiet, understanding type, whereas Jason is just a stubborn mule.  The interaction between these two and the rest of the team makes for great television, even if they don't come up with any great evidence on some cases.Overall, I'd say that this DVD set is worthy of purchase.  Sure, the audio and video are somewhat annoying at times, but this is more than made up for by the actual episodes and the sometimes giddy joy displayed by members of TAPS when they find some sort of evidence that gives them hope for their cause.Highly recommended.",4,"Audio And Video Quality Aside, This Is A Nice Set",1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,1768,"['Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '2', 'actually', 'composed', 'episodes', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'Season', '3', 'very', 'recognizable', 'hotspots', 'such', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'house', 'prison', 'used', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'heavily', 'viewed', 'Willard', 'Library', 'Much', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1', 'set', 'DVD', 'set', 'suffers', 'poor', 'audio', 'grainy', 'video', 'said', 'however', 'Big', 'Vision', 'remedied', 'problem', 'had', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'DVD', 'came', 'loose', 'shipping', 'case', 'was', 'easily', 'damaged', 'factory', 'front', 'door', 'customer', 'new', 'cases', 'are', 'used', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'wonderful', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'guys', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'childproof', 'medicine', 'bottles.The', 'shows', 'are', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'especially', 'St.', 'Augustine', 'Lighthouse', 'episode', 'TAPS', 'team', 'up', 'amazing', 'evidence', ""'m"", 'always', 'impressed', 'professionalism', 'seriousness', 'exuded', 'TAPS', 'squad', 'Sure', 'team', 'often', 'over', 'things', 'too', 'much', 'due', 'bickering', 'come', 'up', 'such', 'strong', 'evidence', ""'ve"", 'always', 'pictured', 'team', 'founders', 'Jason', 'Hawes', 'Grant', 'Wilson', 'good', 'cop/bad', 'cop', 'duo', 'Grant', 'be', 'quiet', 'understanding', 'type', 'Jason', 'just', 'stubborn', 'mule', 'interaction', 'two', 'rest', 'team', 'great', 'television', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'great', 'evidence', 'cases.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'DVD', 'set', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'Sure', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'times', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'actual', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'giddy', 'joy', 'displayed', 'members', 'TAPS', 'when', 'find', 'sort', 'evidence', 'hope', 'cause.Highly', 'recommended']","Ghost Hunters: Season 2, Part 2"

1002052,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000GDH8HE,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","Ok, I have to admit some bias to this particular dvd set of Ghost Hunters.  Mainly because the first episode was filmed in my home town, at the Mansfield Reformatory.  It's a creepy, wonderful place (as evidenced by movies being filmed there) and I've actually been there several times.  They do a Haunted House Tour every year, and one year I was a volunteer for it.  My job was to sit at the top of the stairs leading to Solitary (by myself) and make sure when the tours went through they didn't fall down the stairs.  Unlike TAPS though, I didn't have any paranormal experiences.  Regardless, it was fantastic to see it featured on the show.TAPS is The Atlantic Paranormal Society.  They investigate hauntings, setting out with equipment to prove or disprove hauntings in places.  What makes them different is that they primarily disprove Hauntings, so when they do find something, it's more meaningful.  They use a variety of equipment, including EMF detectors, temperature gauges, video and audio recordings.  These are used in hope of having concrete evidence of a haunting, rather than just personal experiences.The group was created by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson after they both had experiences they couldn't explain.  Joining them are several investigators, with Steve the Tech Manager, Brian the Investigator, Donna the Case Manager, and Dave the Investigator in Training being the most notable.  Because there is such a variety of people, there's always a lot of drama going on.  Especially when Brian is involved, as he seems to cause a lot of stress and strife within the group.  I find this kind of distracting actually, and hate that the show has to include it, even if does help improve ratings (it is a reality show afterall).  I also prefer when they stick to the main investigators, and am not too fond when they have a parade of different people go through as it makes it hard to judge each person's integrity in regards to investigations.This 2nd part of Season 2 has some great locations that they film at.  There's the Mansfield Reformatory, as I already mentioned.  The Lizzie Borden House, Crescent Hotel, Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Paladium Theatre, Valentown Museum, Willard Library, Hartford Conservatory, St. Augustine Lighthouse (very exciting episode), Domani's Restaurant, St. Augustine Jail, Stone Line Inn, private residences, and most notably of all, the Stanley Hotel.  Which was another fantastic episode.Because this is a show that very much relies on quality sound and visuals, it's hard to see some things from their footage sometimes.  This improves in later seasons when they get better equipment, but even with what they have, they are still able to present some great evidence.  But, it is disappointing when you're straining to see the evidence, and it just isn't that clear.  Another distracting aspect is the background noise while on investigations.  There are sound effects and music playing so you can't always hear what the investigators are hearing.I love this show and think that they offer up some unusual things to the viewer.  There's a reason it's survived through several seasons and it's because of the unique way they approach ""ghost hunting.""Review by M.

Sometimes, they can debunk claims that a place is haunted. I like season 2 part 1 better. Sometimes, they can pick up a shadow or a ghostly voice which is weird.

Both sound and picture suffered throughout most episodes and at times the show would freeze for a few seconds. I thought it was my dvd player that caused the problems but I see that others experienced the same diffculties. I wish I held back and read some reviews before purchasing these dvds that way I would of known what to expect and held back on ordering them.
