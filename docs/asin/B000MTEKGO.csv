1050645,AB4F6UHL20U95,B000MTEKGO,Anne Rice,"[66, 73]","When I was growing up in the 1940's, there was a statue of St. Rita in every Catholic church.  She was portrayed as a nun, with a wound in her forehead which she had received as a form of the Stigmata.  But what enchants me about this brilliant film is that it gives us the life of Rita before she entered the convent.  We see a saint in the world of marriage and child rearing, contending with the realities of the quarrelsome and warlike Italian families of her time.  We see her struggling to convert and save her husband Paolo, to guide her children away from the code of honor that required of them a vendetta after the death of their father.  We see her moving through the streets of her town as the plague rages, as people cry for bread, or for help in their illnesses and misery.  Of course we go on to see her enter the religious life, and receive the wound for which we so well know her.  But the scope of the tale, and the depth of Rita's accomplishments are what give the film its power.  Production values are excellent; the actress is wondrously convincing and compelling; the script is good.  I recommend seeing it with English subtitles and listening to the Italian voices that give it a greater feel of authenticity.  Ignatius Press is to be commended for bringing us this powerful and unforgettable film. It is absorbing throughout, with excellent sets and costumes, and exteriors. It is beautiful.  It is also a wonderful gift for Catholics who grew up loving St. Rita as I did.",5,Marvelous Portrait of a Saint in the World,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1497,"['When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', '1940', 'was', 'statue', 'St.', 'Rita', 'Catholic', 'church', 'was', 'portrayed', 'nun', 'wound', 'forehead', 'had', 'received', 'form', 'Stigmata', 'what', 'brilliant', 'film', 'life', 'Rita', 'entered', 'convent', 'see', 'saint', 'world', 'marriage', 'child', 'rearing', 'contending', 'realities', 'quarrelsome', 'warlike', 'Italian', 'families', 'time', 'see', 'struggling', 'convert', 'save', 'husband', 'Paolo', 'guide', 'children', 'away', 'code', 'honor', 'required', 'vendetta', 'death', 'father', 'see', 'moving', 'streets', 'town', 'plague', 'rages', 'people', 'cry', 'bread', 'help', 'illnesses', 'misery', 'course', 'go', 'see', 'enter', 'religious', 'life', 'receive', 'wound', 'so', 'well', 'know', 'scope', 'tale', 'depth', 'Rita', 'accomplishments', 'are', 'what', 'give', 'film', 'power', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'actress', 'wondrously', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'script', 'good', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'English', 'subtitles', 'listening', 'Italian', 'voices', 'give', 'greater', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'be', 'commended', 'bringing', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'absorbing', 'excellent', 'sets', 'costumes', 'exteriors', 'beautiful', 'also', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'Catholics', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'loving', 'St.', 'Rita', 'did']",Saint Rita

But she lived with this for many years, and it was not understood by all in the Augustinian convent where she spent forty years.St. Rita of Cascia is perhaps one of the most well-known Saints since she is the Patroness of Impossible Cases, also known as ""the Peacemaker.""

Porter,"[45, 61]","I am a traditional Catholic, and I have small children in my family so it's important that the Saint movies are generally clean, show the Church in a good light, and have good examples they can copy.  Even though this movie doesn't really stray too much out of those bounds, I still took issue with it.The biggest thing that annoyed me is that Saint Rita just didn't SEEM like a Saint. She just seemed like a normal person living a hard life that rose above it as best she could.  Now granted, that's what a Saint is, but I just couldn't get beyond Saint Rita's portrayal. If you watch this movie and see her life, there is nothing that would show her to be a Saint in it, nothing that would raise her above millions of others who have done reasonably well amidst hard circumstances.  One reviewer mentioned that it wasn't historical and that it seemed like a Chick Flick. I couldn't agree more.  I LOVE Saint movies, but this one just didn't feel like a Saint movie, it felt like a secular take on a Saint Rita, trying to bring her to the normal person's ""level"" rather than having us try to rise to HER level.Secondly, there were some things I did not care for: Saint Rita and her new husband are showed pretty heavily kissing and making out for a few brief moments, where they fall on the bed and the camera moves away.  Not a big deal especially since they are married, but I didn't want my little children to see this, let alone me! We watch very clean movies only and I don't think it's appropriate for a movie about a Saint to be sexually charged, no matter how mild it is. Also, the whole ""family"" thing was out of an Italian gangster movie, it's done horribly, not accurate to the times, and it's an obvious copy of the mafia.  It's just ridiculous. Those are two examples of the ""artists"" taking artistic leeway in this film, and it in my opinion lowers it. There's nothing there for my 5 year old daughter to emulate in this Saint, nothing that I as a Catholic mother can rise to with this Saint. It's really just secularizing a Saint's life to make it more friendly to the general populace, and in my opinion I think they went wayyyy too far.",3,"Very secularized ""saint"" Rita, in my opinion",1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2154,"['am', 'traditional', 'Catholic', 'have', 'small', 'children', 'family', 'important', 'Saint', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'clean', 'show', 'Church', 'good', 'light', 'have', 'good', 'examples', 'can', 'copy', 'Even', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'stray', 'too', 'much', 'bounds', 'still', 'took', 'issue', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'Saint', 'Rita', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'SEEM', 'Saint', 'just', 'seemed', 'normal', 'person', 'living', 'hard', 'life', 'rose', 'could', 'Now', 'granted', 'what', 'Saint', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Saint', 'Rita', 'portrayal', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'life', 'nothing', 'would', 'show', 'be', 'Saint', 'nothing', 'would', 'raise', 'above', 'millions', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'reasonably', 'well', 'amidst', 'hard', 'circumstances', 'One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'was', ""n't"", 'historical', 'seemed', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'LOVE', 'Saint', 'movies', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Saint', 'movie', 'felt', 'secular', 'take', 'Saint', 'Rita', 'trying', 'bring', 'normal', 'person', 'level', 'rather', 'having', 'try', 'rise', 'HER', 'level.Secondly', 'were', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Saint', 'Rita', 'new', 'husband', 'are', 'showed', 'heavily', 'kissing', 'making', 'out', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'where', 'fall', 'bed', 'camera', 'away', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'especially', 'are', 'married', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'little', 'children', 'see', 'let', 'alone', 'watch', 'very', 'clean', 'movies', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'Saint', 'be', 'sexually', 'charged', 'matter', 'how', 'mild', 'Also', 'whole', 'family', 'thing', 'was', 'Italian', 'gangster', 'movie', 'done', 'horribly', 'not', 'accurate', 'times', 'obvious', 'copy', 'mafia', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'artists', 'taking', 'artistic', 'leeway', 'film', 'opinion', 'lowers', 'nothing', 'there', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'emulate', 'Saint', 'nothing', 'Catholic', 'mother', 'can', 'rise', 'Saint', 'really', 'just', 'secularizing', 'Saint', 'life', 'make', 'more', 'friendly', 'general', 'populace', 'opinion', 'think', 'went', 'wayyyy', 'too', 'far']",Saint Rita

Actually it might be helpful not to know too many facts about St. Rita, since apparently some liberty was taken here.  I am not Catholic and so was blissfully ignorant of the facts and was therefore free to be completely inspired by this film.  At first I was a bit suspicious that it might be sugar coated or shabbilly produced or poorly acted, as a lot of religious films are.  So I was heartily pleased at the level of production and especially the acting.  The woman portraying Rita gave a performance that was deeply moving---as good as many Oscar winning performances, in my opinion.  I think that the subject was so inspiring that it brought out the absolute best in the actress.The setting and costumes were all well done.  I loved the whole poltical intrigue and could see how the codes of family, honor, and vengeance have passed on down to the present day. I was amused at the scene when Rita was asked to leave the table because she spoke up.  It reminded me of a time when I was touring Italy with an American girl and her Italian boyfriend.  One evening, over dinner, which he insisted on buying, I spoke out and he yelled at me for the same thing. Fortunately I wasn't married to him.  :-)I can see how some people would be distressed at historical inaccuracies but for me, the spirit of the story is more important than getting the facts exactly right.  I was amazed over and over at the tremendous strength that Rita showed in forgiving over and over and her insistence on love.  I intend to find out more about this wonderful woman!I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open heart and mind who is willing to be inspired.",5,Tremendously inspiring film,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,1732,"['was', 'going', 'title', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Catholic', 'love', 'film', 'Actually', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'not', 'know', 'too', 'many', 'facts', 'St.', 'Rita', 'apparently', 'liberty', 'was', 'taken', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'Catholic', 'so', 'was', 'blissfully', 'ignorant', 'facts', 'was', 'therefore', 'free', 'be', 'completely', 'inspired', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'suspicious', 'might', 'be', 'sugar', 'coated', 'shabbilly', 'produced', 'poorly', 'acted', 'lot', 'religious', 'films', 'are', 'was', 'heartily', 'pleased', 'level', 'production', 'especially', 'acting', 'woman', 'portraying', 'Rita', 'gave', 'performance', 'was', 'deeply', 'moving', '-as', 'good', 'many', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performances', 'opinion', 'think', 'subject', 'was', 'so', 'inspiring', 'brought', 'out', 'absolute', 'best', 'actress.The', 'setting', 'costumes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'loved', 'whole', 'poltical', 'intrigue', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'codes', 'family', 'honor', 'vengeance', 'have', 'passed', 'present', 'day', 'was', 'amused', 'scene', 'when', 'Rita', 'was', 'asked', 'leave', 'table', 'spoke', 'up', 'reminded', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'touring', 'Italy', 'American', 'girl', 'Italian', 'boyfriend', 'One', 'evening', 'dinner', 'insisted', 'buying', 'spoke', 'out', 'yelled', 'same', 'thing', 'Fortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'married', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'distressed', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'spirit', 'story', 'more', 'important', 'getting', 'facts', 'exactly', 'right', 'was', 'amazed', 'over', 'tremendous', 'strength', 'Rita', 'showed', 'forgiving', 'insistence', 'love', 'intend', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'open', 'heart', 'mind', 'who', 'willing', 'be', 'inspired']",Saint Rita
