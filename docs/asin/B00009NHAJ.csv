755545,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,B00009NHAJ,Andrew Parodi,"[7, 7]","While I won't go so far as to say that this is a good film, it's actually not that bad, or at least not as bad as you've heard. In fact, as a pop culture artifact it's actually quite interesting 25 years down the line.Sean Penn is now revered as one of the great actors of his generation, and Madonna's status as the most prolific female pop singer of all time is secured. (Love her or hate her, it's hard to ignore a pop culture presence spanning three decades with over 200 million albums sold!) It's interesting to look back at this film and remember that upon release, Madonna had really only been a superstar for two years (1985 was her breakout year) and many were still predicting she'd soon fade into oblivion, and Sean Penn was still considered a young Hollywood bad boy, one of the ""Brat Pack."" Together, they were referred to as ""The Poison Penns."" A lot can change in 25 years!As someone who lived through the 1980s, I recall all the hatred focused on this movie at the time of release. It was made out to be pretty much the worst film ever made, almost as though Madonna and Sean Penn had committed some great moral sin. Because it was only in the theatres for about a week, I didn't have the chance to see this film in the theatres. To be honest, I didn't even know it had been made until I saw a poster in the local video store advertising it was soon to be released on video. So, I did rent it when it was released, and I remember at the time agreeing that it was an awful film. But, in retrospect, I think I was just bowing to peer pressure. I think I just thought I HAD to hate this film.I just found a used VHS copy at the video store for a buck, and so I bought it for 80s nostalgia sake. Brought it home, watched it, and was surprised by what I saw. An A-list soundtrack by a former Beattle (George Harrison); an A-list actor, Sean Penn, giving a decend performance (with an albeit mediocre and somewhat flat character); a solid supporting cast of great character actors; a beautiful location; and, finally, Madonna at the peak of her youthful beauty. She has simply never been more beautiful. (It's great to see her original face. She is still beautiful in her early 50s, but after all of her work that is not the face anyone of my generation grew up seeing all the time. She looks like a different woman altogether now!) In addition to all of this, I see Sean Penn attempting to support his wife's bid to be taken seriously as an actress. I think he agreed to do this movie purely as a labor of love, a favor for Madonna. Add to this the fact that Madonna has described Sean as having been the love of her life, which is tragic because the marriage, of course, famously ended in divorce -- and what you have, 25 years down the line, is actually what the movie attempts to be: a touching love story.I'm left scratching my head about why this movie was so badly hated upon the time of release. I've read that the theme song, a beautiful song by George Harrison, was even given a very undeserved Razzie for ""Worst Song from a Movie."" I'm left thinking that the hatred of this film was personal: Sean Penn and Madonna were not liked at the time of shooting, at least not by the press. Obviously, this is because at the time Sean was often punching them! About a year after this film was released, he served time in prison for assaulting a photographer. Additionally, it is true that Madonna is not the greatest actress, and I think people in Hollywood and the media in general didn't like her ambition; she should've known her place as a sexy pop singer and not have pretensions of being a serious actress. (That much said, her performance in this movie is actually okay. Not great, but not terrible either.)So, while certainly not a great movie, or even a good movie, Shanghai Surprise is not as bad as you've heard. Twenty-five years down the line, I'd describe it as being a curious, quirky, and touching pop culture artifact.",3,Not as bad as you've heard,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,3948,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'good', 'film', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'fact', 'pop', 'culture', 'artifact', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', '25', 'years', 'line.Sean', 'Penn', 'now', 'revered', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'generation', 'Madonna', 'status', 'most', 'prolific', 'female', 'pop', 'singer', 'time', 'secured', 'Love', 'hate', 'hard', 'ignore', 'pop', 'culture', 'presence', 'spanning', 'three', 'decades', '200', 'million', 'albums', 'sold', 'interesting', 'look', 'back', 'film', 'remember', 'upon', 'release', 'Madonna', 'had', 'really', 'only', 'been', 'superstar', 'two', 'years', '1985', 'was', 'year', 'many', 'were', 'still', 'predicting', ""'d"", 'soon', 'fade', 'oblivion', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'young', 'Hollywood', 'bad', 'boy', 'one', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Together', 'were', 'referred', 'Poison', 'Penns', 'lot', 'can', 'change', '25', 'years', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', '1980s', 'recall', 'hatred', 'focused', 'movie', 'time', 'release', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'almost', 'Madonna', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'had', 'committed', 'great', 'moral', 'sin', 'was', 'only', 'theatres', 'week', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'theatres', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'saw', 'poster', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'advertising', 'was', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'video', 'So', 'did', 'rent', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'remember', 'time', 'agreeing', 'was', 'awful', 'film', 'retrospect', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'bowing', 'peer', 'pressure', 'think', 'just', 'thought', 'HAD', 'hate', 'film.I', 'just', 'found', 'used', 'VHS', 'copy', 'video', 'store', 'buck', 'so', 'bought', '80s', 'nostalgia', 'sake', 'Brought', 'home', 'watched', 'was', 'surprised', 'what', 'saw', 'A-list', 'soundtrack', 'former', 'Beattle', 'George', 'Harrison', 'A-list', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'giving', 'decend', 'performance', 'albeit', 'mediocre', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'character', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'beautiful', 'location', 'finally', 'Madonna', 'peak', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'simply', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'great', 'see', 'original', 'face', 'still', 'beautiful', 'early', '50s', 'work', 'not', 'face', 'anyone', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'time', 'different', 'woman', 'altogether', 'now', 'addition', 'see', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'attempting', 'support', 'wife', 'bid', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actress', 'think', 'agreed', 'do', 'movie', 'purely', 'labor', 'love', 'favor', 'Madonna', 'Add', 'fact', 'Madonna', 'described', 'Sean', 'having', 'been', 'love', 'life', 'tragic', 'marriage', 'course', 'famously', 'ended', 'divorce', 'what', 'have', '25', 'years', 'line', 'actually', 'what', 'movie', 'be', 'touching', 'love', 'story.I', ""'m"", 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'hated', 'time', 'release', ""'ve"", 'read', 'theme', 'song', 'beautiful', 'song', 'George', 'Harrison', 'was', 'even', 'given', 'very', 'undeserved', 'Razzie', 'Worst', 'Song', 'Movie', ""'m"", 'left', 'thinking', 'hatred', 'film', 'was', 'personal', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Madonna', 'were', 'not', 'liked', 'time', 'shooting', 'least', 'not', 'press', 'Obviously', 'because', 'time', 'Sean', 'was', 'often', 'punching', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'served', 'time', 'prison', 'assaulting', 'photographer', 'Additionally', 'true', 'Madonna', 'not', 'greatest', 'actress', 'think', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'media', 'general', 'did', ""n't"", 'ambition', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'place', 'sexy', 'pop', 'singer', 'not', 'have', 'pretensions', 'being', 'serious', 'actress', 'much', 'said', 'performance', 'movie', 'actually', 'okay', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'terrible', 'either', 'So', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'Shanghai', 'Surprise', 'not', 'as', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Twenty-five', 'years', 'line', ""'d"", 'describe', 'being', 'curious', 'quirky', 'touching', 'pop', 'culture', 'artifact']",N/A

On the plus side, this movie and Who's That Girl showcase Madonna's lack of natural acting ability so one is never tempted to even wonder if her remake of the Italian classic Swept Away deserves a look-see and if you hated Sean Penn's cannibalistic turn in Mystic River, you'll love this film as evidence of the actor's lack of integrity and fairness albeit towards the Chinese who aren't supposed to be worth much never mind the rise of their currency.  I was fortunate enough to be in the audience of the original Broadway run of Evita and I have the cast recording and I am convinced that Madonna basically and only copied what she could glean off the recording of Patti Lupone's performance for the extended music video that was the moovie Evita.  I don't want to express anything hurtful so I will restrain myself from giving my complete opinion about this movie and what I think it says about these two actors.

I had to save it and spend it on movies I thought would be worth my money. Well I skipped this one as the reviews back then were just horrible. They beat up Madonna and Sean Penn pretty badly back then as I recall. And I would recall very well as I was a HUGE Madonna fan back then. But after all of these years I finally watched it. I don't get what was so wrong. I can remember three of them: 1) The way Madonna read the line ""He's gaining"" 2) The fake way Madonna was ""crying"" after she fell out of the window and 3) the way the guy chasing them ran through all the merchants and people on the street for ""action"" when he could have ran down the empty street itself. The ending had a good twist but was a left one thing loose for me . . . where were the flowers all the time? And what were those jewels? That didn't seem to be explained well. Other than this I liked the movie. It was a Adventure's in Babsitting, Ferris Beuller's Day off, type of movie . . . . Nothing special. Nothing horrible. I think people were hell bent on bringing Madonna under control back then  . . . they couldn't let her get too big  . . . not at least with acting as she had already conquered the music world. . . and for good reason as we found out in the 90s (when I stopped being a fan). It probably deserves two stars. But I am going to give it 3 as I feel misled by all the bad press around it. Also the extra features were just OK. There should have been more . . . deeper . . . more secrets revealed after all of this about a movie that bombed so badly and with such big names attached to it. Were was Madonna, Sean, and George's remarks? And Melissa Rivers??? Shows they just rushed to put something together to make it a ""Special Edition"". Why not forgo the VH1 personalities and get the actors. They only had the one.

755562,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00009NHAJ,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Everyone knows ""Shanghai Surprise"" (1986), starring Sean Penn and Madonna when they were still very young, is regarded as one of the worst films ever made. Don't believe it. I'm not saying it's a good film, but it's certainly not one of the worst ever made.People complain about the film and the acting as if it was supposed to be a serious drama when, in fact, it's a goofy romantic-comedy adventure a la ""High Road to China"" or ""Romancing the Stone (Special Edition)"", but with way more talk and less action. I'd also compare it to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)"" but the Indiana Jones films are in a whole different league.Like I said, people complain about, say, Madonna's acting, but she strikes the right note for a semi-goofy romantic-comedy/adventure. It's low camp all the way. What other approach can you expect in this type of movie?The highlights are seeing Madonna and Sean when they were so young (not that I'm a fan of either), as well as George Harrison's original songs, the Hong Kong locations, a good Bond-parody villain and the amusing shenanigans throughout.If ""Shanghai Surprise"" had added two or three great action sequences the movie would have been better received. As it is, there are NO great action scenes. There are quite a few scenes of quasi-violence and intrigue, but no memorable action sequences like Indiana Jones.
