1335720,AMPY9KLI3ZSEE,B003BJO8Q4,Bruce Simon,"[2, 2]","My wife and I watched ""The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry"" this afternoon. What we witnessed was an unforgettable story of a seventy five year old man Jonathan Sperry, who takes three adolescent boys under his wing and encourages them to commit their lives to a closer walk with Jesus Christ. Dustin, Mark and Albert are three friends in the summer of 1970, who are struggling with straddling that fine line between childhood and adulthood known as adolescence. Dustin, in particular, is feeling an attraction toward a pretty classmate, Tanya, while trying to stay out of the way of Nick, a bully, who delights in tormenting those he perceives are weaker and don't fight back.While mowing a neighbor's lawn, Dustin catches the eye of Jonathan Sperry, a widower, who invites Dustin at first to mow his lawn and then invites the three friends over for a Bible study.  With simple life-changing biblical wisdom, Jonathan inspires the boys to apply the lessons of Jesus to their daily lives even to the point of interceding for their worst enemy, Nick.This film conveys the beauty of Christian commitment in a simple, practical fashion. There is no droning intellectualism or self righteous condemnation. This movie is genuine in that Jonathan wants each boy to give their lives to Jesus and make a difference in someone's lives by their witness.Jonathan is a true mentor whose delight is expressed in the seeds of faith which he plants, waters and watches grow. Gavin Macleod is priceless as the venerable wise senior who dispenses faith as readily as homemade lemonade. Robert Guillaume is great as the crusty neighbor who is at first suspicious of peoples motives until his life changes.It is a joy to see each child grow in grace under the tutelage of a man, who loves unconditionally despite hardship and loss.It is a pleasure to see a movie which respects the Lord  and is unashamed to give Him rightful glory.

1335727,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B003BJO8Q4,C. Long,"[9, 19]","First let me clearly state: I am a Christian, run a Christian movie review ministry, and LOVE a number of Christian films.I was looking forward to this movie.  This movie has some redeeming things and many Christians obviously do seem to like it (as evidenced by the many 5 star reviews) so part of me just wants to defer to them, however it is my opinion that this movie unfortunately suffers quite a bit from its obvious attempt to try to be ""too Christian"" by using situations that don't really match with real life. In all honesty, the unrealistic story made me cringe in numerous locations to the point that I did consider turning it off. It had a somewhat cheesy, unrealistic quality throughout the whole thing. Plus, the acting was merely ""passable"".  I'm sorry people, but I've seen much better Christian movies...The basic premise of the story was good - an older man that befriends a young boy and teaches him & shows by example the Christian faith. I think there's probably a part of all of us that want to see a movie succeed that portrays someone from an older generation really impacting and affecting the younger generation in such a positive way for Christ. I certainly do. And maybe that's the explanation for why everyone rates this film so high - because it certainly can't be on acting and production quality and lack of cheese factor!  But while the premise may be good, I honestly believe that the actual execution of it could have been SO much more than what it was. Instead, we get an almost entirely predictable story that tries way too hard to have the characters be exactly what the writers believe that they have to be, if you're following me. Realism was not something this movie portrays in most any way. And thus, sometimes when I see Christian movies like this, I wonder how much harm they actually can do because I can perfectly understand why a non-believer that were to see it would just laugh right through it (at us ""silly Christians"" for producing such a film, that is!). I personally for that reason would definitely only recommend it for Christians, but ""recommend"" might be too strong - I see value in the movie as it does portray some good Christian messages and themes (which given the amount of trashy movies out there is a major plus!), but I feel it could have been much much more than what it was.  I wanted this film to be great and I really felt it could have been...but I think it fell short.With all that said, it can still be an enjoyable movie for believers to uplift you in your faith and it obviously has done just that for many, so you might want to check it out.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",3,"Questionable for unbelievers, Could have been so much more",1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,2689,"['First', 'let', 'clearly', 'state', 'am', 'Christian', 'run', 'Christian', 'movie', 'review', 'ministry', 'LOVE', 'number', 'Christian', 'films.I', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'things', 'many', 'Christians', 'obviously', 'do', 'seem', 'like', 'evidenced', 'many', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'part', 'just', 'defer', 'however', 'opinion', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'quite', 'bit', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'try', 'be', 'too', 'Christian', 'using', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'real', 'life', 'honesty', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'made', 'cringe', 'numerous', 'locations', 'point', 'did', 'consider', 'turning', 'off', 'had', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'unrealistic', 'quality', 'whole', 'thing', 'acting', 'was', 'merely', 'passable', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'Christian', 'movies', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'older', 'man', 'young', 'boy', 'shows', 'example', 'Christian', 'faith', 'think', 'probably', 'part', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'succeed', 'someone', 'older', 'generation', 'really', 'impacting', 'affecting', 'younger', 'generation', 'such', 'positive', 'way', 'Christ', 'certainly', 'do', 'maybe', 'explanation', 'why', 'everyone', 'rates', 'film', 'so', 'high', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'lack', 'cheese', 'factor', 'premise', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'honestly', 'believe', 'actual', 'execution', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'Instead', 'get', 'almost', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'have', 'characters', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'writers', 'believe', 'have', 'be', ""'re"", 'following', 'Realism', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'movie', 'most', 'way', 'thus', 'sometimes', 'when', 'see', 'Christian', 'movies', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'harm', 'actually', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'perfectly', 'understand', 'why', 'non-believer', 'were', 'see', 'would', 'just', 'laugh', 'right', 'silly', 'Christians', 'producing', 'film', 'personally', 'reason', 'would', 'definitely', 'only', 'recommend', 'Christians', 'recommend', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'see', 'value', 'movie', 'portray', 'good', 'Christian', 'messages', 'themes', 'given', 'amount', 'trashy', 'movies', 'major', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'really', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'think', 'fell', 'short.With', 'said', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'believers', 'uplift', 'faith', 'obviously', 'done', 'just', 'many', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

For a kids' Sunday school type story, it has merits, but it was as though it was written to present its Christian message, rather than the message naturally evolving through the drama of the Christian life.  It lacked real drama, and the ending seemed contrived, no foreshadowing to make it seem plausible.As a coming of age story it lacked focus - tried to cover too many experiences in a brief time span: a boy's first crush; boys coping with a bully; boys losing a friend; an extra caring neighbor contrasted with a bitter neighbor, and a secret which just appeared at the end without warning, while making of Mr. Sperry the Preacher.It is not bad.  It's just not as good as it might have been had the blatantly obvious preaching been omitted, and had their been some unfolding. It's the sort of movie that only a Christian could appreciate; whereas I believe a good Christian story even an atheist could appreciate.

The latter tend to come across as sermons disguised as movies or books or whatever.  This film has too much of that.  The only thing missing was the altar call and I don't say that to be overly critical.  For being set in 1970 it still comes across as too much like Leave It To Beaver. The 'good' kids seems a little too good and the 'bad' dude seems a little too good, also.  In not wanting to offend the 'church' audience they sanitize it to the point it doesn't seem real.  The bullies I remember used language that offended and other gestures that conveyed less than holy thoughts.  Even good kids didn't always have it together or behave appropriately all the time. While the acting is pretty decent and it has warm fuzzies, it just doesn't come across as a realistic portrayal of the way life happens even to those whose faith is a priority in their life.  Is it a waste of time?  No, it has its merits and there are several meaningful lessons to be considered by viewers. Many will be inspired by the message of the film. There is nothing wrong with the movie, it's just that I would love to see people of faith concentrate on developing great stories where faith fits naturally into the story instead of developing a message and trying to fit it into a movie.  There is a difference and the difference is between a realisic portrayal of life and what we would like to imagine life to be like.

I found this movie at Walmart last week and could not wait to see it as I had seen the movie advertised on tv. I was so touched by its content and message and as I watched the movie progress I found myself sobbing. Some said that it had everything but an altar call and that bothered them. I say that more movies are needed with a story that touches hearts like this did for me. I went back to Walmart and bought three more to give as gifts. I did not think it sugarcoated the salvation message. In fact it made it so simple for someone to watch and comprehend what Mr. Christiano was trying to get the audience to see. The scene at the cemetary especially was heart wrenching and also how Mr. Sperry showed the Lord's love to those boys who then took that love and shared it with friends. How can this be a movie that would not be rated 5 stars is what I want to know. I am so tired of what Hollywood has to offer our families and when producers and writers bring us films with a message and with no cursing and one that pierces hearts with the salvation message I say, ""Bring them on!"" I have purchased almost all their movies and also The Morning After films which I enjoyed. I enjoy them because they reach people and they certainly reached my heart with truth and conviction. Families need to watch The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry and plan a discussion afterwards about what it meant to you and other family members.

The characters are very likeable and there are humorous parts dotted throughout.  Here is a quick look at the main characters:Dustin is raised by his mom after his father dies. He's thoughtful and kind and always ready to lend a helping hand.Albert is a silly boy who struggles with keeping a tight reign on his tongue. He provides much comedic relief.Mark is the braniac who seems to have knowledge far beyond his years.Nick is a bully who is also being raised by his mom and who has no qualms about picking on Dustin and his friends.We also meet Bailey, a girl whose father owns the cafe and whom Dustin has a crush.Jonathan Sperry is a 75-year-old man who is active in his church and taught Mark's brother in Sunday School. He lives out his faith and allows God to use him to make an impact on the lives around him.One of the things I loved most about Jonathan Sperry's character was that he actively lived out his faith. He wasn't preachy, yet he showed real-life examples for each lesson. I especially loved the lesson where the boys had to reach the $5 bill on the picnic table. The graveyard scene is also a scene full of impact that depicts the urgency in telling others about Christ.Two of the boys in the movie grew up without fathers. What a wonderful example and mentor Jonathan Sperry was especially to those two boys.  This movie had strong themes of redemption, faith, forgiveness, and kindness.This is a heartwarming film for the entire family. While not preachy, it does share an important message. There is also nothing objectionable in the movie, and I highly recommend it!I have added The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog.

I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie this would be BUT I was pleasantly surprised by the intriguing story.  There is amazing cast of actors but it's the message of the movie that will really touch your heart.  I was so glad that my ten year old was watching it with me.  He laughed and cried (well he had tears in his eyes).  This movie is based on a true story.  A story that will touch your soul.  It is not an action, fast moving picture show.  It is a slower make-you-sit-up-and-take-notice movie!  This movie reminds me of the quote by S. Truett Cathy  (founder of Chick-fil-A), ""It's easier to build boys than to mend men."" A wonderful movie for boys but it also gave ""me pause"" -- to think about the words I speak, about the people I (need) to tell about Jesus' love, about forgiveness and what a child learns today will stay with him for a lifetime.  Need a great family movie?  This is it!

The story sort of reminds me of Stand by Me in a sense that there are three kids and how they are adjusting to certain situations like a crush on a girl, to dealing with a bully.  I think Gavin McCloud's character is well portrayed.  He does a wonderful job.  My favorite part is in the cemetery.  I won't reveal what happens, but the dialogue in that scene is impacting and really resonated with me as a believer.  Robert Guillome's character, I felt, could've came a little sooner, but it was moving nonetheless.  I highly recommend this film to all family members young and old.
