729889,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B00007JZYQ,Alice L. Moore,"[1, 1]",This dvd is excellent for those starting an exercise program or already have a routine in place.  Why?  You can start out with the low impact walking.  The space requirements are only 5 square feet(good for small living quarters).  No special equipment is required to start.  The workout can be quite basic or you can make it complex with weights by adding high impact jogging as opposed to walking.  The 4 mile portion can be made to a one mile portion and a cool down.  Again beginners can start right away.Another thing I liked about this dvd is that there were not complicated dancy moves.  The exercisers were at various stages of fitness and age groups.  This is true of all of Leslie Sansone's dvds/videos.  I'm one who gets intimidated by an exercise group that looks like they could go to the Olympics.Also these dvds have worked for myself.  Even if you go to a fitness club on a regular basis this can be used for in between recovery days.  If you do at home fitness this can be alternated with15-Minute Workouts for Dummiesfor hand weight training.,4,A good exercise program,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1060,"['dvd', 'excellent', 'starting', 'exercise', 'program', 'already', 'have', 'routine', 'place', 'Why', 'can', 'start', 'out', 'low', 'impact', 'walking', 'space', 'requirements', 'are', 'only', '5', 'square', 'feet', 'good', 'small', 'living', 'quarters', 'special', 'equipment', 'required', 'start', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'basic', 'can', 'make', 'complex', 'weights', 'adding', 'high', 'impact', 'jogging', 'opposed', 'walking', '4', 'mile', 'portion', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'one', 'mile', 'portion', 'cool', 'down', 'Again', 'beginners', 'can', 'start', 'right', 'away.Another', 'thing', 'liked', 'dvd', 'were', 'not', 'complicated', 'dancy', 'moves', 'exercisers', 'were', 'various', 'stages', 'fitness', 'age', 'groups', 'true', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'dvds/videos', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'intimidated', 'exercise', 'group', 'could', 'go', 'Olympics.Also', 'dvds', 'have', 'worked', 'Even', 'go', 'fitness', 'club', 'regular', 'basis', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'recovery', 'days', 'do', 'home', 'fitness', 'can', 'be', 'alternated', 'with15-Minute', 'Workouts', 'Dummiesfor', 'hand', 'weight', 'training']",N/A

It is meant for people who are more out of shape or can't do regular cardio due to restraints from joints. It is very low impact.

729892,A13700AF4X40YG,B00007JZYQ,Loves Books in MD,"[6, 6]","I'm not sure when these workouts were originally produced, but they have a dated look about them and the set and production values are not as good as most recent ones I've done, such as Walk and Kick, the 30 Minute Walk and her Walk Away the Pounds (WATP) Super Fat Burning 3 Miles DVDs - but that isn't meant to say that they aren't good workouts - just be aware what you're getting.The workouts on this DVD are Walkaerobics, which I found slightly more intense than her WATP series.  I'm an intermediate exerciser that uses a variety of DVD's to keep it from getting boring - and some of them, such as Tae Bo and The Firm, are pretty intense.  So I was surprised when the first workout on this DVD - the 2 mile Walkaerobics, had me sweating within the first 6 minutes and is at a fairly fast pace. It had the look of almost a home movie, but that doesn't keep it from being a decent workout.The second workout contains 3 segments of 1.0 miles, 1.5 miles and 1.5 miles, each of which take about 20 minutes. If you do all 4 miles, it'll take you about 60 minutes in total,including the cool down.  As I mentioned earlier, the production in this DVD is not quite as smooth as her newer DVD's.  Between each of the 3 segments is a pause/gap while they flash the words ""Segment 2"" and ""Segment 3"" on the screen.  The first segment is done alone, then Leslie welcomes new ""friends"" to her ""home"" for Segment 2 and 3 (slightly hokey, as was her references to the changing weather - complete with the faux window showing changing conditions).  I'd have preferred a smoother or seamless transition between the segments for those of us who want to complete the full 4 miles without any gaps in the routine.  I did the full 4 miles and felt it was a good workout - I certainly worked up a good sweat.Despite the slightly dated appearance and less slick set/production, I think these are good workouts and probably a bit more intense than some of her WATP routines.  I wouldn't recommend these for new exercisers, as they are aerobic walking and more intense, the foot/arm work a little more complicated - and Leslie's cueing isn't quite as good as she's become in newer workouts (she's not yet mirroring her cues, so her right is your left).  I think those looking for a bit more of a challenge than the WATP, the Walkaerobics may provide a better workout for you.  I thought Leslie was engaging and pleasant to exercise with in these workouts.",4,"A Bit Dated, but More Intense - Good Workout",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2435,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'when', 'workouts', 'were', 'originally', 'produced', 'have', 'dated', 'look', 'set', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'recent', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'done', 'such', 'Walk', 'Kick', '30', 'Minute', 'Walk', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'WATP', 'Super', 'Fat', 'Burning', '3', 'Miles', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'meant', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'workouts', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting.The', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'are', 'Walkaerobics', 'found', 'slightly', 'more', 'intense', 'WATP', 'series', ""'m"", 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'variety', 'DVD', 'keep', 'getting', 'boring', 'such', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'Firm', 'are', 'pretty', 'intense', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'first', 'workout', 'DVD', '2', 'mile', 'Walkaerobics', 'had', 'sweating', 'first', '6', 'minutes', 'fairly', 'fast', 'pace', 'had', 'look', 'almost', 'home', 'movie', ""n't"", 'keep', 'being', 'decent', 'workout.The', 'second', 'workout', '3', 'segments', '1.0', 'miles', '1.5', 'miles', '1.5', 'miles', 'take', '20', 'minutes', 'do', '4', 'miles', ""'ll"", 'take', '60', 'minutes', 'total', 'including', 'cool', 'down', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'production', 'DVD', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'smooth', 'newer', 'DVD', 'Between', '3', 'segments', 'pause/gap', 'flash', 'words', 'Segment', '2', 'Segment', '3', 'screen', 'first', 'segment', 'done', 'alone', 'then', 'Leslie', 'new', 'friends', 'home', 'Segment', '2', '3', 'slightly', 'hokey', 'was', 'references', 'changing', 'weather', 'complete', 'faux', 'window', 'showing', 'changing', 'conditions', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'smoother', 'seamless', 'transition', 'segments', 'who', 'want', 'complete', 'full', '4', 'miles', 'gaps', 'routine', 'did', 'full', '4', 'miles', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'certainly', 'worked', 'up', 'good', 'sweat.Despite', 'slightly', 'dated', 'appearance', 'less', 'slick', 'set/production', 'think', 'are', 'good', 'workouts', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'WATP', 'routines', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'new', 'exercisers', 'are', 'aerobic', 'walking', 'more', 'intense', 'foot/arm', 'work', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'Leslie', 'cueing', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'become', 'newer', 'workouts', 'not', 'yet', 'mirroring', 'cues', 'right', 'left', 'think', 'looking', 'bit', 'more', 'challenge', 'WATP', 'Walkaerobics', 'may', 'provide', 'better', 'workout', 'thought', 'Leslie', 'was', 'engaging', 'pleasant', 'exercise', 'workouts']",N/A

The toning section is intense ( at least for beginners ). I understand why some people were not pleased about this being a 1990 production.

Leslie Sansone makes it look easy. Is it? Not the first time. I felt that walking on a treadmill was actually easier. The difference between walkaerobics and simply buying a treadmill is the ""price"" and ""coordination.""Not all of us can successfully complete the grapevine without tripping over our own feet. With that said, she does explain the fancy footwork rather well and I mastered the grapevine in this workout, while still struggle with it in other workouts. For some reason, I just am not as coordinated as some and more than others. It depends on the pacing. This is a fast-paced workout.Home walking combines fast stepping in place with variations. You are either in one place or moving forward/back or side to side. There are a few times where you do sort of go in a circle. Otherwise, she uses simple aerobics moves and alternates them with stepping in place.If you enjoy a Pilates or Yoga workout, you could use this as a 20-minute warm-up before your regular routine.Two Mile Walk:You can stop at 1 mile or go for two.Weight Loss Walk:Segment 1 - She works out by herself in a very tight black outfit. The woman has absolutely no fat on her. That means this walking works? Right?Segment 2 - Joined by 3 workout buddies.Segment 3 - Joined by 3 workout buddies.An easy-to-follow workout which doesn't require too much coordination, but the pace is fast and if you get behind, then you just step in place. (Like, I um had to in places.)Leslie is has a fun loving personality and presents a friendly upbeat workout without being overbearing. She has created 48 walking programs so you can lose pounds and inches and get sexy all while walking in your own living/workout room.The goal is to get to 10 miles a week by the 4th week of the program. You start with 6 miles the first week, move to 7 1/2 the second week and should be at 8 1/2 miles by the third week.Leslie makes you move. Get ready to have some fun and feel the burn. I felt muscles I didn't know I had.
