There were enough ups and downs, highs and lows to keep it interesting, but the overall mood wasn't as violent and heavy as Crazy Hearts.

41802,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0782010679,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 7]","I understand why Robert Duvall won the Oscar for this riveting and very beautifully restrained performance, but I fail to see why any other aspect of this movie is regarded as worthy of our praise.  Personally I found the film a missed opportunity, and that upsets me since it had so much promise.`Tender Mercies' tells the story of Mac Sledge, a famous country singer turned drunk who squandered his fame and fortune, lost his wife and child and wound up broke, working off his room and board at a motel/service station.  He cleans up his act and falls in love with the owner of the motel, widow Rosa Lee, whose husband died in Vietnam.  Mac marries Rosa Lee and all seems well until the urge to get back into music comes knocking on their front door.  Mac attempts to write new songs, interact with his ex-wife and now teenage daughter, and fight the urge to fall back into drinking.He finds God, he finds love and he finds himself.Like I said, this sounds great, but it falls short in just about every area.  The biggest issue I have is the films construction.  I skips around so much that we never really get to understand the characters.  Months go by in a few seconds, if just feels rushed.  The film is under two and a half hours, which is a shame because more time was needed to flesh out these people without making them feel like caricatures.  This method of delivery really takes its toll on the characters of Rosa Lee and her young son Sonny.  Because so little time is spent getting to know them they come off rather uninteresting, and when they attempt to fill us in on who they are it comes off forced.  It just doesn't feel natural some of their conversations; those spur of the moment ""mommy, how did daddy die"" conversations feel out of place.Another issue I have is the poor acting.  Like I mentioned, I understand the love for Duvall.  His turn is devastatingly understated.  He really understood this character and delivers a memorable and remarkable performance here.  There is a passion in Duvall, a passion that is made apparent in characters he feels adjacent to.  I saw it in `The Apostle' and I saw it here as well.  Aside from Duvall though, the acting is very spotty.  Tess Harper and Allan Hubbard suffer mostly because of the scripting of their characters, but that aside Hubbard especially is very bad.  Betty Buckley is uneven as Dixie, Mac's ex-wife.  I loved her first few scenes, but her final nervous breakdown was way too over the top.  Ellen Barkin was stunning in her few scenes, I won't fault her a thing.  Her conversation with Duvall has the perfect mix of adoration and uncomfortable confusion.A lot of people love this movie.  It was Oscar nominated for almost every big award, including Best Director and Best Picture, but honestly, Duvall is all this movie deserves.  It had so much potential, but its poor construction and spotty supporting cast leave for a very underwhelming film.",2,"Lord, have mercy...",1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,2930,"['understand', 'why', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'won', 'Oscar', 'riveting', 'very', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'performance', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'other', 'aspect', 'movie', 'regarded', 'worthy', 'praise', 'Personally', 'found', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'upsets', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise.', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'tells', 'story', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'famous', 'country', 'singer', 'turned', 'drunk', 'who', 'squandered', 'fame', 'fortune', 'lost', 'wife', 'child', 'wound', 'up', 'broke', 'working', 'off', 'room', 'board', 'motel/service', 'station', 'up', 'act', 'love', 'owner', 'motel', 'widow', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'husband', 'died', 'Vietnam', 'Mac', 'marries', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'well', 'urge', 'get', 'back', 'music', 'knocking', 'front', 'door', 'Mac', 'write', 'new', 'songs', 'interact', 'ex-wife', 'now', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'fight', 'urge', 'fall', 'back', 'drinking.He', 'finds', 'God', 'love', 'himself.Like', 'said', 'great', 'short', 'just', 'area', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'films', 'construction', 'skips', 'around', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'understand', 'characters', 'Months', 'go', 'few', 'seconds', 'just', 'feels', 'rushed', 'film', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'shame', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'flesh', 'out', 'people', 'making', 'feel', 'caricatures', 'method', 'delivery', 'really', 'toll', 'characters', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'young', 'son', 'Sonny', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'getting', 'know', 'come', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'when', 'attempt', 'fill', 'who', 'are', 'off', 'forced', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'natural', 'conversations', 'spur', 'moment', 'mommy', 'how', 'did', 'daddy', 'die', 'conversations', 'feel', 'place.Another', 'issue', 'have', 'poor', 'acting', 'mentioned', 'understand', 'love', 'Duvall', 'turn', 'devastatingly', 'understated', 'really', 'understood', 'character', 'memorable', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'here', 'passion', 'Duvall', 'passion', 'made', 'apparent', 'characters', 'adjacent', 'saw', 'Apostle', 'saw', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Aside', 'Duvall', 'acting', 'very', 'spotty', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Allan', 'Hubbard', 'suffer', 'mostly', 'scripting', 'characters', 'aside', 'Hubbard', 'especially', 'very', 'bad', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'uneven', 'Dixie', 'Mac', 'ex-wife', 'loved', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'final', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'was', 'stunning', 'few', 'scenes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fault', 'thing', 'conversation', 'Duvall', 'perfect', 'mix', 'adoration', 'uncomfortable', 'confusion.A', 'lot', 'people', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'almost', 'big', 'award', 'including', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Picture', 'honestly', 'Duvall', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'poor', 'construction', 'spotty', 'supporting', 'cast', 'leave', 'very', 'underwhelming', 'film']",N/A

It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Song and Best Director.  It was what is known in the movie business as a ""sleeper"".  While not up to par with my other favorite Foote's works (the screenplay author) like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Trip to Bountiful"" this movie more than holds its own.  Duvall is quietly fine as a man trying to find himself again.  Tess Harper as Rosa Lee, the woman he marries, is perfect in her role.  The little boy who plays Sonny, Rosa Lee's son is a talented youngester.  Betty Buckley gives a tour-de-force performance as Dixie, Duvall's ex wife who holds a severe grudge against him.  Ellen Barkin plays Duvall's grown up daughter with touching poignancy.  The film also boasts a fine musical score with traditional country music.  The DVD is in widescreen, has scene selection and has a 32 minute documentary on the making of the film called ""Miracles and Mercies"" with interviews with Duvall, Harper and a grown up Sonny, who has become a talented guitar player in his own right.  Horton Foote and the film's director are also featured.  The other extras are Biographies of Duvall, Foote and the film's director.  It would have been nice to have biographical snippets of Harper, Buckley, Barkin and ""Sonny"".  At 92 minutes the film moves along with very few lulls.

It won Oscars for leading male actor (Duvall) and screenplay (Foote). It had several other Oscar nominations and many film awards. We chose this for our December movie in our ""Great Films at the Cathedral"" series.Horton Foote wrote this screenplay specifically for Robert Duvall. He'd previously won an Oscar for ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" IMDb.com's bio of Foote said his ""....success can be attributed to his honest examination of the human condition, and why some people survive tragedies while others are destroyed. His central themes of the sense of belonging and longing for home have resonated with audiences for 60 years."" And ""Tender Mercies"" is such a movie. It's definitely not an action film; it's character studies of Duvall and those close to him.Duvall plays the role of Mac Sledge -- a former C&W; star, now middle aged, broke, alcoholic. He wakes up one morning in a marginal small motel on the empty Texas plains run by a young widow, Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), who has a pre-teen son. Mac has no money to pay for his lodging so he offers to work it off; she accepts on the condition he not drink.Mac has problems with his anger which alcohol sometimes pacified, sometimes enflamed. Alcohol and anger led to the divorce from his previous wife, Dixie (Betty Buckley), still a famous C&W; star, and her prohibiting Mac from having any contact with their daughter (Ellen Barkin).""TM"" deals with themes of broken parent-child relations (the widow's son and his deceased father; Mac and his daughter), longing for their restoration, and the building of others. And the gradual development over time and trials of the five central characters.It's a quiet, perceptive movie in which tensions are generated by Mac's desire to see his daughter, his anger, his battle to stay sober, questions about his handling his previous fame and will he sing again.After several months of working for/with the widow, while they're both weeding the garden, Mac says, (IIRC) 'I guess there's no secret how I feel about you. Would you consider marryin' me?' and she says, 'I reckon I would' Typical scenes of the wedding and nuptial bed aren't in the movie -- Foote's got more important issues to present and the story deals with those.IMO, the casting was perfect -- not a single one would be better if replaced by someone else. One professional reviewer said Tess Harper's role as Rosa Lee was weak; I disagree. I thought she was perfect as the young widow, trying to hang on -- insecure and inexperienced in dealing with all that life dealt her -- but trying to use her faith to sustain her.Psychologically, everything was true to life -- no false, implausible notes, and it even includes the realistic, seldom-seen way that problems can cascade through the generations despite efforts to prevent that happening.While some disappointments, tragedies, minor triumphs are experienced, by the movie's end one is uplifted. A perfect movie.",5,"quiet, thought provoking",1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,3008,"['Tender', 'Mercies', '1983', 'color', '92', 'minutes', 'one', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Great', 'Films', 'won', 'Oscars', 'leading', 'male', 'actor', 'Duvall', 'screenplay', 'Foote', 'had', 'several', 'other', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'many', 'film', 'awards', 'chose', 'December', 'movie', 'Great', 'Films', 'Cathedral', 'series.Horton', 'Foote', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'specifically', 'Robert', 'Duvall', ""'d"", 'previously', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'IMDb.com', 'bio', 'Foote', 'said', '.success', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'honest', 'examination', 'human', 'condition', 'why', 'people', 'survive', 'tragedies', 'others', 'are', 'destroyed', 'central', 'themes', 'sense', 'belonging', 'longing', 'home', 'have', 'resonated', 'audiences', '60', 'years', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'character', 'studies', 'Duvall', 'close', 'him.Duvall', 'plays', 'role', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'former', 'C', 'W', 'star', 'now', 'aged', 'broke', 'alcoholic', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'marginal', 'small', 'motel', 'empty', 'Texas', 'plains', 'run', 'young', 'widow', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'who', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'Mac', 'money', 'pay', 'lodging', 'so', 'work', 'off', 'condition', 'not', 'drink.Mac', 'problems', 'anger', 'alcohol', 'sometimes', 'pacified', 'sometimes', 'enflamed', 'Alcohol', 'anger', 'led', 'divorce', 'previous', 'wife', 'Dixie', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'still', 'famous', 'C', 'W', 'star', 'prohibiting', 'Mac', 'having', 'contact', 'daughter', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'TM', 'deals', 'themes', 'broken', 'parent-child', 'relations', 'widow', 'son', 'deceased', 'father', 'Mac', 'daughter', 'longing', 'restoration', 'building', 'others', 'gradual', 'development', 'time', 'trials', 'five', 'central', 'characters.It', 'quiet', 'perceptive', 'movie', 'tensions', 'are', 'generated', 'Mac', 'desire', 'see', 'daughter', 'anger', 'battle', 'stay', 'sober', 'questions', 'handling', 'previous', 'fame', 'will', 'sing', 'again.After', 'several', 'months', 'working', 'for/with', 'widow', ""'re"", 'weeding', 'garden', 'Mac', 'IIRC', 'guess', 'secret', 'how', 'feel', 'Would', 'consider', 'marryin', 'reckon', 'would', 'Typical', 'scenes', 'wedding', 'nuptial', 'bed', 'are', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Foote', 'got', 'more', 'important', 'issues', 'present', 'story', 'deals', 'those.IMO', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'replaced', 'someone', 'else', 'One', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'role', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'was', 'weak', 'disagree', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'young', 'widow', 'trying', 'hang', 'insecure', 'inexperienced', 'dealing', 'life', 'dealt', 'trying', 'use', 'faith', 'sustain', 'her.Psychologically', 'everything', 'was', 'true', 'life', 'false', 'implausible', 'notes', 'even', 'realistic', 'seldom-seen', 'way', 'problems', 'can', 'cascade', 'generations', 'efforts', 'prevent', 'happening.While', 'disappointments', 'tragedies', 'minor', 'triumphs', 'are', 'experienced', 'movie', 'end', 'one', 'uplifted', 'perfect', 'movie']",N/A

Robert Duvall is Mac Sledge, a down-and-out country singer who spends two drunken nights in a rundown motel on the Texas prairie, and then stays on and eventually marries the owner (Tess Harper). The story is told in fast cuts, in bits and pieces, with so much left out that even the characters don't know each other. There is something effective about it, though, at least on the surface, especially Duvall's quiet performance, that makes it enjoyable. The scene where Duvall's estranged daughter (played by Ellen Barkin) visits him and asks him to sing a song he used to sing to her as a little girl and he tells her he doesn't remember it, but as soon as she leaves he sings it to himself, is heartbreaking.

The week after it won a few Oscars, cable TV had the right to show it to the cable subscribers of America.For me, Crazy Heart will always be a better movie because I had the soundtrack and read a novel long before I saw the movie. There was upchuck over an old song in Crazy Heart which made me feel that the movie was perfect for illustrating the perils of nightlife based on nothing but clown juice. Tender Mercies was sad at the beginning because none of the women had been able to maintain some ideal happiness that would be great for American girls raised on promises.

It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony.

The Oscar is well-deserved but so are the performances of everyone else:  Tess Harper in her theatrical debut, young Ellen Barkin and Texas-born child actor Allen Hubbard also round out the story.Duvall plays a recovering alcoholic who tries to hide from his past.  His past is filled with hard drinking, violence and carelessness.  This behavior results in his divorce from his country-singing wife (Betty Buckley) who is still making her Opry rounds with great success.But this is not just a movie about a former alcoholic fighting for redemption.  You don't see Duvall drink in this movie.  This is about lost love, war, internal personal struggles, faith and second chances.  This is an emotional movie.  One realizes early in this slow-moving film that there are secrets that will be revealed.  It takes a tragic death for the main characters to come together, all which come to surface in the last ten minutes when Duvall's character talks emotionally to Tess Harper in her small garden patch as the wind blows her hair and dress wayward.  Very touching.Duvall is a convincingly good singer.  There is no dubbing his voice in this film.This movie was filmed in around Parker and Waxahachie, Texas, two isolated and lonely small towns that are constant backdrops of the story.  The dry flat prarie, the blowing sand, the wide blue skies, the wind-blown traffic signs and the gentle demeanor of the characters make this truly a good Texas movie.A bonus to this copy is the 32-minute extra ""Miracles and Mercies"" of the director and the main characters talking about their feelings of making this movie nearly 20 years after this movie was made.

It has such realistic people, it kept me fascinated because it seemed so different from most films I've watched.There aren't a lot of dramatic things that happen in the story yet, as a whole, it's a wonderful tale that stays with you. It's a lot more than just seeing an Oscar-winning performance by Robert Duvall as Texan and former C&W; singer and writer, ""Mac Sledge."" It's simply good storytelling  I can't say I am a fan of Duvall's country singing, but that is the only thing I didn't like. Well, maybe ""Dixie"" (Betty Buckley), who played a bitter ex-wife of Duvall's in here. She was not pleasant, but others were really nice, likable people. Yet, this is not some sappy movie just because most of the people are good folks.As in film noirs in which the viewer has a sense of dread, knowing something bad is around the corner, I felt the same thing in this film, even though it didn't necessarily happen. I mean with the main characters: Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny. There was underlying tension, probably because of Sledge's alcoholic and violent past, that made me fear that any minute he was going to ruin the nice setup he had with a good woman and nice stepson.Duvall, as usual, makes his role a fascinating and unpredictable one. With many of the people he has played over the years, you never am sure what his characters are going to do next. Tess Harper, as Mac's new wife, and Alan Hubbard, as her son, are two of the most realistic characters I've ever seen on film. It helped they were from the area so their accents were real.This is a just straight drama, with a solid screenplay by Horton Foote and direction by Bruce Beresford (""Driving Miss Daisy""). In addition, actors Buckley (who can sing, too), Wilford Brimley and Ellen Barkin all give memorable supporting performances. It was an interesting tale of something I have rarely seen on film in the past 50 years: a good Christian woman lifting up a man to her level. She never had to do it verbally, never nagged or preached to the man, just set example of how to act and be a loving, supportive spouse.

It is a story of redemption, marveling at grace and yet also puzzling over grace withheld.Hollywood rarely turns the cameras on the red states and even more rarely on Evangelical Christians and even more rarely does so with compassion and understanding. (One of the few other films that does these things well also stars Robert Duvall, ""The Apostle"", which Duvall also wrote and directed.)Tess Harper is also very good in the film as the woman who takes in a lost, lonely man.

Moore,"[141, 145]","&quot;Tender Mercies&quot; proves beyond doubt that Americans can make movies the way Europeans do, and still make them unmistakably American. Sure, the director, Bruce Beresford, is Australian, but screenwriter Horton Foote and star Robert Duvall--both of whom won richly deserved Oscars--root this movie firmly in Texas soil. As Mac Sledge, an alcoholic country singer trying to rebuild his life and career, Duvall gives a performance of astounding complexity and emotional impact, all the more astounding because of its laconic spareness. It ranks as one of the greatest performances ever given by an American actor. He is nearly matched by Tess Harper as his new wife and Ellen Barkin as his daughter from his first marriage, and Russell Boyd's photography captures the Texas prairie in all its stark, lonesome beauty. Two other performances that deserve praise are those of Betty Buckley as Mac's country-star first wife--a woman who has let paranoia and resentment take over her life--and Allan Hubbard as Mac's stepson, a resoundingly normal, likable kid. Don't come to this movie looking for slam-bang action--it's a quiet, gentle slice of life, brimming with poignant emotion, filled with love and respect for its characters and their way of life.",5,As close to perfection as movies ever get.,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,1256,"['quot', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'quot', 'doubt', 'Americans', 'can', 'make', 'movies', 'way', 'Europeans', 'do', 'still', 'make', 'unmistakably', 'American', 'Sure', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'Australian', 'screenwriter', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'star', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'whom', 'won', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'root', 'movie', 'firmly', 'Texas', 'soil', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'alcoholic', 'country', 'singer', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'life', 'career', 'Duvall', 'performance', 'astounding', 'complexity', 'emotional', 'impact', 'more', 'astounding', 'laconic', 'spareness', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'ever', 'given', 'American', 'actor', 'nearly', 'matched', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'new', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'daughter', 'first', 'marriage', 'Russell', 'Boyd', 'photography', 'Texas', 'prairie', 'stark', 'lonesome', 'beauty', 'Two', 'other', 'performances', 'deserve', 'praise', 'are', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'Mac', 'country-star', 'first', 'wife', 'woman', 'who', 'let', 'paranoia', 'resentment', 'take', 'life', 'Allan', 'Hubbard', 'Mac', 'stepson', 'resoundingly', 'normal', 'likable', 'kid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'looking', 'slam-bang', 'action', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'slice', 'life', 'brimming', 'poignant', 'emotion', 'filled', 'love', 'respect', 'characters', 'way', 'life']",N/A
41856,A2QTA1DLFXS1BX,0782010679,M. Lampers,"[64, 64]","Sometimes you can't do it any better. This is one of those times. Bruce Beresford has crafted a perfect film; one whose only drawback is that it ever has to end. Beresford, Robert Duvall and Tess Harper manage to create both characters and a world that allow you fall into the screen and forget you are watching a film. You will be moved to both tears and laughter, and left feeling very warm in a subtle way forgotten by most of today's films that try and twist your emotions with blunt force trauma.It is the story of a man, Mac Sledge, who has seen bright lights and soaring heights but has now fallen on extremely hard times. Drunk, broke, and looking none to trustworthy, Mac is befriended, and finally loved, by a young widow and her son.And that's basically it. There's a subplot involving Mac's estranged relationships with his daughter and ex-wife, but primarily it's about one man picking himself up, dusting himself off, and getting on with life after having been kicked in the pants.The crux of the film is Duvall, and in more ways than one. First and foremost is his complex portrayal of Mac. Conditioned by so many formula movies, you keep waiting for Mac to fall of the wagon, only to redeem himself again somehow. But Mac never does fall, and Duvall lets you see just how difficult that is; how hard, but also how satisfying, it is for a man to stand up to life when all he wants to do is run and hide. And he does it without ever even doing so much as raising his voice.But his acting isn't all Duvall gives to the film. Singing his own songs, Duvall makes you firmly believe that Mac Sledge has an ocean of musical talent. With not much of a voice, and singing rather simple country tunes, Duvall nevertheless evokes powerful images of love, loss and redemption.Certainly there is never a good reason not to see any movie starring Robert Duvall, but this one is perhaps the finest of them all, with only The Apostle and Lonesome Dove ranking up there with Tender Mercies.As I said, you don't want Tender Mercies to end. You want to spend just a few more minutes with Mac and his family, maybe getting to hear him croak out one more soft tune. But end it does, and it does so both subtly and abruptly. It's abrupt because you really aren't expecting the final scene to be the final scene. There's been no mammoth resolution of these people's lives, just slow and steady change and improvement. But that's why I also call it subtle. Because the sudden end fits in perfectly with the picture's meaning. Life doesn't end with swelling music and concrete resolutions, and stories about life are truer when they don't as well. Tender Mercies ends as it began, with a simple moment cut out of a man's life. And it's the triumph of the movie that it allows you to compare the simple final scene to the first one and realize that, for Mac Sledge, it's an accomplishment as dramatic as walking on the moon.",5,A perfect movie about an imperfect man.,931564800,"07 10, 1999",1999,2914,"['Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'one', 'times', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'crafted', 'perfect', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'drawback', 'ever', 'end', 'Beresford', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'manage', 'create', 'characters', 'world', 'allow', 'fall', 'screen', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'laughter', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'warm', 'subtle', 'way', 'forgotten', 'most', 'today', 'films', 'try', 'twist', 'emotions', 'blunt', 'force', 'trauma.It', 'story', 'man', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'who', 'seen', 'bright', 'lights', 'soaring', 'heights', 'now', 'fallen', 'extremely', 'hard', 'times', 'Drunk', 'broke', 'looking', 'none', 'trustworthy', 'Mac', 'befriended', 'finally', 'loved', 'young', 'widow', 'son.And', 'basically', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Mac', 'estranged', 'relationships', 'daughter', 'ex-wife', 'primarily', 'one', 'man', 'picking', 'dusting', 'getting', 'life', 'having', 'been', 'kicked', 'pants.The', 'crux', 'film', 'Duvall', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'First', 'foremost', 'complex', 'portrayal', 'Mac', 'Conditioned', 'so', 'many', 'formula', 'movies', 'keep', 'waiting', 'Mac', 'fall', 'wagon', 'only', 'redeem', 'again', 'somehow', 'Mac', 'never', 'fall', 'Duvall', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'how', 'hard', 'also', 'how', 'satisfying', 'man', 'stand', 'up', 'life', 'when', 'do', 'run', 'hide', 'ever', 'even', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'raising', 'voice.But', 'acting', ""n't"", 'Duvall', 'film', 'Singing', 'own', 'songs', 'Duvall', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'ocean', 'musical', 'talent', 'not', 'much', 'voice', 'singing', 'rather', 'simple', 'country', 'tunes', 'Duvall', 'nevertheless', 'powerful', 'images', 'love', 'loss', 'redemption.Certainly', 'never', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'one', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'only', 'Apostle', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'ranking', 'up', 'there', 'Tender', 'Mercies.As', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'end', 'want', 'spend', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'Mac', 'family', 'maybe', 'getting', 'hear', 'croak', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'soft', 'tune', 'end', 'so', 'subtly', 'abruptly', 'abrupt', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'final', 'scene', 'be', 'final', 'scene', 'been', 'mammoth', 'resolution', 'people', 'lives', 'just', 'slow', 'steady', 'change', 'improvement', 'why', 'also', 'call', 'subtle', 'sudden', 'end', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'picture', 'meaning', 'Life', ""n't"", 'end', 'swelling', 'music', 'concrete', 'resolutions', 'stories', 'life', 'are', 'truer', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'began', 'simple', 'moment', 'cut', 'out', 'man', 'life', 'triumph', 'movie', 'compare', 'simple', 'final', 'scene', 'first', 'one', 'realize', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'accomplishment', 'as', 'dramatic', 'walking', 'moon']",N/A

The gentleness of Horton Foote's story, set in Texas in the aftermath of Vietnam, makes it seem like it came from some other Hollywood than the one that turns out the noisy, special-effects belabored product that fills today's movie screens. The opening scenes of the film, which set the film's tone and pace, are elliptical and spare, and while much of the story concerns writing and performing music, the soundtrack is typically quiet - like the night-time crickets we hear as the film starts. When Duvall finally fronts a local band to sing one of his songs at a bar, you hang onto the words like they come from the heart - which they do.Make no mistake, I loved this film when I first saw it in 1983, and it brought tears to my eyes when I saw it again in 2007. It's all the family values you hear in country and western songs about simple people and rural roots, yet it's no rose-colored portrayal of lives lived without mistakes made, disappointments, or trials by fire. The film is made up of small moments that carry the weight of all that the heart bears, and they stay with you, like Duvall standing at a window and softly singing ""On the Wings of a Snow White Dove."" Director Bruce Beresford brings a sensibility to Horton Foote's story that makes these characters spring to life (including brief appearances by Ellen Barkin and Wilford Brimley) while placing them in a Texas prairie that is both welcoming and lonesome.

41875,A303U1MOXG5R1F,0782010679,Sylviastel,"[2, 2]","You don't need a big story to make a great film. You need well-developed characters, a storyline, a great cast and crew to make it happen. Tender Mercies was first written by Horton Foote, a late American playwright/screenwriter, who wrote about quiet people. He wrote about America between the coasts. He was also responsible for adapting ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" to film. He won an Oscar for that screenplay adaptation and for original screenplay for ""Tender Mercies."" Anyway, Horton Foote is not as well-known as other playwrights but he is still about as American as you can get.In this film, Robert Duvall who won awards for playing alcoholic country singer, Mac Sledge, takes up residence at a motel/gas station owned by a young widow, Rosa Lee (played by Tess Harper in her first film role). Their relationship slowly progresses and it's not as passionate as you might expect. They slowly develop a friendship and a relationship of trust as long as he doesn't drink. She doesn't know that he's a famous country singer now broke and helping around their home.Anyway, Allan Hubbard played Sonny, the widow's son and stepson, who does a marvelous job in the role. The film also stars Paul Gleason (reporter); Betty Buckley (Mac's first wife); and a young Ellen Barkin (Mac's daughter).It's ironic that no American director wanted to make this film. Foote had to find an Australian Bruce Beresford who did a masterful job of bringing this story to film. The film doesn't have anything outlandish or crazy. I was a little upset by what happened to Mac's daughter but I still think this film is one of the finest of the 1980s.It was filmed on location in Texas entirely in the flatlands as they call it. Mac's battle to save himself is really the main storyline. How he overcomes his past and present is another storyline. Tess Harper does a fantastic job in her role. She brings out the tenderness in Mac's character. I really recommend this film as required viewing. It's films like this that earned awards not based on how much money, star power, or special effects. Tender Mercies is what great films are all about.Anyway, this DVD version celebrates the 20th anniversary of the film's release with interviews with Robert Duvall, Tess Harper, Horton Foote, Bruce Beresford, and Allan Hubbard to remember a great film and their time in making it happen.",5,As Tender As It Gets!,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,2357,"['do', ""n't"", 'need', 'big', 'story', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'need', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'storyline', 'great', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'happen', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'was', 'first', 'written', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'late', 'American', 'playwright/screenwriter', 'who', 'wrote', 'quiet', 'people', 'wrote', 'America', 'coasts', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'adapting', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'Anyway', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'not', 'as', 'well-known', 'other', 'playwrights', 'still', 'about', 'as', 'American', 'can', 'get.In', 'film', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'won', 'awards', 'playing', 'alcoholic', 'country', 'singer', 'Mac', 'Sledge', 'up', 'residence', 'motel/gas', 'station', 'owned', 'young', 'widow', 'Rosa', 'Lee', 'played', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'not', 'as', 'passionate', 'might', 'expect', 'slowly', 'develop', 'friendship', 'relationship', 'trust', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'drink', ""n't"", 'know', 'famous', 'country', 'singer', 'now', 'broke', 'helping', 'around', 'home.Anyway', 'Allan', 'Hubbard', 'played', 'Sonny', 'widow', 'son', 'stepson', 'who', 'marvelous', 'job', 'role', 'film', 'also', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'reporter', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'Mac', 'first', 'wife', 'young', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Mac', 'daughter', '.It', 'ironic', 'American', 'director', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'Foote', 'had', 'find', 'Australian', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'who', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'outlandish', 'crazy', 'was', 'little', 'upset', 'what', 'happened', 'Mac', 'daughter', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'finest', '1980s.It', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Texas', 'entirely', 'flatlands', 'call', 'Mac', 'battle', 'save', 'really', 'main', 'storyline', 'How', 'past', 'present', 'storyline', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'out', 'tenderness', 'Mac', 'character', 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'required', 'viewing', 'films', 'earned', 'awards', 'not', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'star', 'power', 'special', 'effects', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'what', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'about.Anyway', 'DVD', 'version', '20th', 'anniversary', 'film', 'release', 'interviews', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'Allan', 'Hubbard', 'remember', 'great', 'film', 'time', 'making', 'happen']",N/A

However, Duvall has stated his role was not based on any certain singer.In preparation for the role Duvall would often go to bars and watch men sing on stage and read about the country music industry and realize the men that were a part of it were not immuned from addictions as the pressures and rigors of performing can destroy the most strongest of individuals.The movie was only a modest success, but earned multiple Oscars including the one for Duvall for Best Actor, a statue for Best Screenplay, and most importantly Best Picture.

Bruce  Beresford is one of those itinerant directors who has managed a career out  of a suitcase.  Yet every film he has made, excepting perhaps Her Alibi, is  something of a masterpiece.  Tender Mercies could be used to instruct film  school students about how suggestive a film can be with an absolute minimum  of means.  Mac Sledge and the people he encounters in that armpit of the  world have only the most rudimentary means of expression.  Song writing,  though littered with the usual emblematic platitudes, is his only chance at  what might otherwise be mistaken for self-transcendence, but is actually  his only way of expressing the bafflement he feels in the face of life.  Meretriciously, but sweetly, his bitter ex-wife (played beautifully by  Betty Buckley) has made a good living off all the love songs he once wrote  for her, and continues to sing them (albeit without conviction).  When he  finds happiness again, even if he refuses to trust it, he is compelled to  write songs again.  And one of the loveliest scenes in the film is his  unassuming return to singing. And Robert Duvall creates another of his  sculptured performances of a simple man who finds eloquence through his  mistrust of happiness and his bewilderment at life.
