It's pretty cheesey in comparison to the newer X-Men cartoons, but it's still pretty neat. The various characters are potrayed more acurately than on the newer cartoons.

196148,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300131424,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","You may not know that in between guest appearances in SPIDER-MAN & HIS AMAZING FRIENDS and their own animated series launched in 1992, there was an X-Men cartoon pilot in 1989 that never panned out into an ongoing series. This 22-minute-long PRYDE OF THE X-MEN pilot is only available on VHS tape. The animation on it looks pretty good, too.Amidst the expected tropes and retreads, a few interesting tidbits stand out in this pilot episode. We eye the X-Men cast, and the roster lists the usual suspects: Professor X, Cyclops, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Wolverine, etc. But one unexpected X-Man stands out, and that's Alison Blaire a.k.a. the Dazzler, and she seems slated to get more run here. Then there's the matter of the grumpy Wolverine flaunting an Australian accent (what's up with that?), and I guess there's a certain irony in that Hugh Jackman who plays Wolverine in the movies is an Australian. And then, maybe because the group name ""Brotherhood of Evil Mutants"" doesn't sound relevant enough in these darker contemporary times (but remember that this was before 9/11), the X-Men are soon butting heads with the Brotherhood of Mutant Terrorists.The Brotherhood is, of course, headed up by Magneto, Master of Magnetism. In this incarnation, Magneto has got no redeeming qualities whatsoever (he keeps kicking the little dragon). His nefarious scheme this time around involves stealing a power circuit from the X-Men, and this has to do with his intent to divert a comet and send it hurtling towards Earth. For Magneto, it's another attempt to assert his mutantkind's dominance and to enslave humanity. For the X-Men, it must be a Tuesday.14-year-old Kitty Pryde is the newest X-Man and it's apparent that she's meant to be the viewer's stand-in. We regard the X-Men's outrageous world thru her incredulous eyes, and I bet you'd initially freak out, too, if someone as demonic-looking as Nightcrawler were to approach you. Meanwhile, Wolverine spends the entire episode talking smack about Kitty. In this one, Stan Lee narrates the story, just as he did in SPIDER-MAN & HIS AMAZING FRIENDS. In this one, the White Queen is a straight-up villain and she sounds like an old hag. Overall, this pilot was well produced; it seemed a promising beginning, even if it presented a standard premise and that theme song was really hokey. It surprises me that PRYDE OF THE X-MEN was never made into a continuing series. I mean, this is a debut episode that culminates with a battle in space for all the marbles. That's doing it big.The VHS tape also features a PSA from the VSDA with Spider-Man encouraging everyone to vote. I have no idea why I'm mentioning this last, or at all.

196150,A17M20ISV4BP07,6300131424,"Peter Saenz ""Artemisboy""","[7, 7]","Made in 1989, Marvel comics decided to give it's most profitable comic book (X-Men) the animation treatment. In Pryde of the X-Men, Marvel took the 'Wizard of Oz Approach' to storytelling as we see a new-comer to the X-Ranks in the character Kitty Pryde. Kitty is born a mutant who finds she can walk through walls. Scared and confused by her mutantcy, Kitty is sent a letter to attend the Xavier Institute to learn how to control her mutant abilities. It is here that she (and we) are introduced to the X-Men. A group of persons who share a similar past. Like Kitty, they too were born with wonderous powers. The welcome is short lived though as the evil Magneto breaks into the X-Mansion where the X-Men live and steals a powerful computer circuit. The X-Men and Kitty Pryde must find out why and stop Magneto's terrible scheme. Made with an animation style that mirrored successful cartoons such as G.I. Joe and Thundercats, Pryde of the X-Men had a great visually appealing look. Although this was the only episode made, audiences were not to wait too long for more adventures from the merry mutants. In 1992 and 2000 the X-Men were re-introduced to new generations of fans.

On one side stands humans, who for all of history have been at the top of the food chain, the most dominant of all species. Now another player has entered the genetic battlefield and this new combatant looks much like the old. Mutants, a genetic variation to their ancestors are now present amongst us all and they offer a vision for a new world order.Captured by the American military, Magneto is the leader of a violent militaristic wing of mutants who refuse to stand by and watch the inferior human subspecies corral mutants as if they are animals. But what the military doesn't know is that Magneto is no mere run-of-the-mill mutant. No, he is much, much more, and their ignorance to his power will cost them dearly.If the military can not stop him then who can? The X-men will stand between him and the destructive path that Magneto is walking. But just who are these ""X-Men""?Led by Professor Xavier, a team of mutant peacekeepers are humans only chance for survival. And it is the Professor who sets out to bring more mutants into the fold for planetary peace. It is that doctrine (with the help of cerebro) that leads Xavier to the doorstep of Ms. Pryde. Little does Ms. Pryde know just how much is in store for her future. Along with the Professor, Cyclops, Colossus, the Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Storm, Ms. Pryde joins the fold and prepares for a future of confrontation against those who threaten peace.In this episode the team sets out to track down Magneto's plan for future conflict against the humans. But Magneto is not alone in his battle for the future, he too has weapons in the form of mutants. Joining Magneto is Juggernaut, the Blob, Toad and Pyro. It is inevitable that the two groups will face off, but a third party is close on both their heals.Will Magneto succeed in incorporating cerebro's power crystal into his technology or will the X-men win the day and delay Magneto's quest for planetary wide control?",5,One cannot have an end without a beginning,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1993,"['war', 'brewing', 'future', 'humanity', 'one', 'side', 'humans', 'who', 'history', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'most', 'dominant', 'species', 'Now', 'player', 'entered', 'genetic', 'battlefield', 'new', 'combatant', 'much', 'old', 'Mutants', 'genetic', 'variation', 'ancestors', 'are', 'now', 'present', 'amongst', 'offer', 'vision', 'new', 'world', 'order.Captured', 'American', 'military', 'Magneto', 'leader', 'violent', 'militaristic', 'wing', 'mutants', 'who', 'refuse', 'stand', 'watch', 'inferior', 'human', 'subspecies', 'corral', 'mutants', 'are', 'animals', 'what', 'military', ""n't"", 'know', 'Magneto', 'mere', 'run-of-the-mill', 'mutant', 'No', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'ignorance', 'power', 'will', 'cost', 'dearly.If', 'military', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'then', 'who', 'can', 'X-men', 'will', 'stand', 'destructive', 'path', 'Magneto', 'walking', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'X-Men', 'Led', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'team', 'mutant', 'peacekeepers', 'are', 'only', 'chance', 'survival', 'Professor', 'who', 'out', 'bring', 'more', 'mutants', 'fold', 'planetary', 'peace', 'doctrine', 'help', 'cerebro', 'Xavier', 'doorstep', 'Ms.', 'Pryde', 'Little', 'Ms.', 'Pryde', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'store', 'future', 'Professor', 'Cyclops', 'Colossus', 'Dazzler', 'Nightcrawler', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'Ms.', 'Pryde', 'fold', 'prepares', 'future', 'confrontation', 'who', 'threaten', 'peace.In', 'episode', 'team', 'out', 'track', 'down', 'Magneto', 'plan', 'future', 'conflict', 'humans', 'Magneto', 'not', 'alone', 'battle', 'future', 'too', 'weapons', 'form', 'mutants', 'Joining', 'Magneto', 'Juggernaut', 'Blob', 'Toad', 'Pyro', 'inevitable', 'two', 'groups', 'will', 'face', 'off', 'third', 'party', 'close', 'heals.Will', 'Magneto', 'succeed', 'incorporating', 'cerebro', 'power', 'crystal', 'technology', 'will', 'X-men', 'win', 'day', 'delay', 'Magneto', 'quest', 'planetary', 'wide', 'control']",N/A
196152,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,6300131424,The Man With No Name,"[0, 0]","Oh what treasures you can find at Good Will and Salvation Army.  I myself just found this VHS tape in GREAT shape for .75 cents.  Just watched it, and it plays fine.  That's VHS quality for you, and why I loved them...oh why do things have to change.Anyway this little jaunt was Marvel's first attempt at a X-Men cartoon series.  This particular incarnation did not pan out.  Originally done and released in 1989, it was aired on tv, and that was it.  It may have encored a few times, but fell into the pit soon after.  Save for the VHS tapes that still play, this title is completely out of print, and was NEVER released on DVD.  Why was it not included in the 1990's X-Men series on DVD?  Who knows.The film itself starts off hilarious, with a Spider-Man psa.  Spidey, who is clearly just lying on the floor, but the camera is upside down, preachs to you about how he can't fight all your battles and you need to vote.  He fills out his voter's registration card on camera and says you need to also.  He informs you (the viewer) to go to your local video store and ask them for more details.  What the hell, why would a video rental store have anything to do with voting.  Although, I used to work at one, and people DID come in and ask where they could get registered, thanks Spidey.  My answer was easy, I just pointed at the GIANT DMV, just across from us and said GO THERE.It only gets funnier beyond this psa.  Wolverine as you may have read, sounds like a soccer hooligan/Australian redneck.  Charles Xavier moves his legs, even though he is supposed to be paralyzed from the waist down.  Emma Frost (White Queen) flings lightning bolts like Zeus or something.  Magneto kicks around this little dragon the whole episode, (Pet abuse!!!).  Also the Brotherhood of Mutants, is called the Brotherhood of Mutant Terrorists.  I don't recall seeing Magneto yell ""Death to America"", though, must have missed it.  Colossus looks like he's wearing hooker boots, although that's his look in the comics also...  Toad acts like Igor from 'Frankenstein', complete with ""Master, Master.."" dialogue.  When Wolverine starts talking about Dingos, you can't hold your laughter back anymore.This thing is so wrong that's is funny and enjoyable to watch.  Kitty Pryde yells everytime Nightcrawler comes near her, she thinks he's a demon.  When Pyro and Wolverine both start talking, you'll need your subtitles turned on, what the heck are they saying?All joking aside, the animation quality was superb, for the time.  It actually rivaled the show, that would come later on.  The story is a bit simplistic, Magneto wants to launch a comet at Earth, killing a lot people.  Voice cast choices, well...I already delved into that.This is a non-canon animation that should be included in every collector's set.  Also the box has a hilarious typo, it says ""the only X-men animated adventure ever released.""  Not quite...Keep your eyes peeled at thrift stores for this.  A lot of kids have grown up, and mom's are great about cleaning house, when the kids are off at college, and taking GOLD like this to Good Wills and Salvation Armies.A funny, great view, and must own for completists like myself.Now if only I could find 'Light Years' at the Good Will...",5,My Collection Is Now Complete.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,3236,"['Oh', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'Good', 'Will', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'just', 'found', 'VHS', 'tape', 'GREAT', 'shape', '.75', 'cents', 'Just', 'watched', 'fine', 'VHS', 'quality', 'why', 'loved', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'have', 'change.Anyway', 'little', 'jaunt', 'was', 'Marvel', 'first', 'attempt', 'X-Men', 'cartoon', 'series', 'particular', 'incarnation', 'did', 'not', 'pan', 'out', 'Originally', 'done', 'released', '1989', 'was', 'aired', 'tv', 'was', 'may', 'have', 'encored', 'few', 'times', 'fell', 'pit', 'soon', 'Save', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'still', 'play', 'title', 'completely', 'print', 'was', 'NEVER', 'released', 'DVD', 'Why', 'was', 'not', 'included', '1990', 'X-Men', 'series', 'DVD', 'Who', 'knows.The', 'film', 'off', 'hilarious', 'Spider-Man', 'psa', 'Spidey', 'who', 'clearly', 'just', 'lying', 'floor', 'camera', 'upside', 'down', 'preachs', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'battles', 'need', 'vote', 'out', 'voter', 'registration', 'card', 'camera', 'need', 'also', 'viewer', 'go', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'ask', 'more', 'details', 'What', 'hell', 'why', 'would', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'voting', 'used', 'work', 'one', 'people', 'DID', 'come', 'ask', 'where', 'could', 'get', 'registered', 'thanks', 'Spidey', 'answer', 'was', 'easy', 'just', 'pointed', 'GIANT', 'DMV', 'just', 'said', 'GO', 'THERE.It', 'only', 'funnier', 'psa', 'Wolverine', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'soccer', 'hooligan/Australian', 'redneck', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'legs', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'paralyzed', 'waist', 'down', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'White', 'Queen', 'flings', 'lightning', 'bolts', 'Zeus', 'something', 'Magneto', 'around', 'little', 'dragon', 'whole', 'episode', 'Pet', 'abuse', 'Also', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutants', 'called', 'Brotherhood', 'Mutant', 'Terrorists', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Magneto', 'yell', 'Death', 'America', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'Colossus', 'wearing', 'hooker', 'boots', 'look', 'comics', 'also', 'Toad', 'Igor', ""'Frankenstein"", 'complete', 'Master', 'Master..', 'dialogue', 'When', 'Wolverine', 'talking', 'Dingos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'laughter', 'back', 'anymore.This', 'thing', 'so', 'wrong', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'yells', 'everytime', 'Nightcrawler', 'demon', 'When', 'Pyro', 'Wolverine', 'start', 'talking', ""'ll"", 'need', 'subtitles', 'turned', 'what', 'heck', 'are', 'saying', 'joking', 'aside', 'animation', 'quality', 'was', 'superb', 'time', 'actually', 'rivaled', 'show', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'story', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'Magneto', 'launch', 'comet', 'Earth', 'killing', 'lot', 'people', 'Voice', 'cast', 'choices', 'well', 'already', 'delved', 'that.This', 'non-canon', 'animation', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'collector', 'set', 'Also', 'box', 'hilarious', 'typo', 'only', 'X-men', 'animated', 'adventure', 'ever', 'released', 'Not', 'quite', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'thrift', 'stores', 'lot', 'kids', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'mom', 'are', 'great', 'cleaning', 'house', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'off', 'college', 'taking', 'GOLD', 'Good', 'Wills', 'Salvation', 'Armies.A', 'funny', 'great', 'view', 'must', 'own', 'completists', 'myself.Now', 'only', 'could', 'find', ""'Light"", 'Years', 'Good', 'Will']",N/A
