Its not the typical story because of the excerps of individual members of Company K. It is slow moving compared to most war films and spends as much time on personel than on battle sequents. It's a moving story that is not for the faint of heart & brings out the worst of men under wars battle conditions. Even though the events took place in World War One, it holds true for our wars now. I would not recommend it to the average war buff because of it's pace and some of the events shown. All in all ,I enjoyed it. Don't expect it to leave you with a good feeling.

I am not familiar enough with the ethnicity of the different cultural areas to know if they are stereotyping here(like the typical WWII US film, the farm guy, the southerner, the guy from Brooklyn, etc). However you come to know and identify with these men and the difficulty of fighting the tribal groups(an experience we now share in common).

1069250,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000P7V4MG,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","That is a quote from the film and might explain the lack of extras in this movie. This film is one I was not sure about as it has attracted such diverse and strong opinions. I am a fan of war films and as such decided to see for myself, and I must say that most of the accusations are sadly, correct. This is a low budget attempt to make a landmark book (same name written by `William March' a pseudonym and published in 1933). I think that is where the film falls down the book is a collection of stories about all the soldiers. And was actually serialised, the film attempts to do this for much of the time. By so doing it has a stop, start feel that acts as a barrier to engaging the audience. As soon as any level of empathy builds up, the story is over and we are asked to engage again with anew character.His autobiographical self sort of tries to hold the whole thing together, but the constant plot holes and lack of any sort of chemistry is a constant deal breaker. Many have complained about the set, and once again they are right. This is supposed to be 1917 to 18, and by this time the battlefields were a mass of mud and detritus. This seems to have been filmed in semi pristine conditions, with only a nod at realism with a fake looking skeleton, half buried in the soil (not mud). The special effects are neither special nor effective and what `action' there is passes quickly and is done in an unconvincing fashion.**Bit of a plot spoiler coming up**. There is also a couple of very weird scenes, including a `Jesus' type appearance and a conversation with a ghost of a German he bayoneted to death, I know Mr March had a nervous breakdown and so his ghosts were probably very real. However, and this is a big however, if the film makers wanted to express this side of war, then the film should have done more about it and not been posited as a war film per se.It is shot in colour with some monochrome scenes and original WW I footage, but if I were to attribute a real colour to this film, it would be grey. There is also some German and French dialogue, but no sub titles, but it is all basic stuff so I was fine with that, but it annoys some people. As others have said there are much better WW I films like `Beneath Hill 60' or `The Lost Battalion', or you could actually read the original book.",3,'Germans heard the yanks were coming and they just cleared out already',1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,2316,"['quote', 'film', 'might', 'explain', 'lack', 'extras', 'movie', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'attracted', 'such', 'diverse', 'strong', 'opinions', 'am', 'fan', 'war', 'films', 'such', 'decided', 'see', 'must', 'say', 'most', 'accusations', 'are', 'sadly', 'correct', 'low', 'budget', 'attempt', 'make', 'landmark', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'William', 'March', 'pseudonym', 'published', '1933', 'think', 'where', 'film', 'down', 'book', 'collection', 'stories', 'soldiers', 'was', 'actually', 'serialised', 'film', 'attempts', 'do', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'stop', 'start', 'feel', 'barrier', 'engaging', 'audience', 'As', 'soon', 'level', 'empathy', 'builds', 'up', 'story', 'are', 'asked', 'engage', 'again', 'anew', 'character.His', 'autobiographical', 'self', 'sort', 'tries', 'hold', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'constant', 'plot', 'holes', 'lack', 'sort', 'chemistry', 'constant', 'deal', 'breaker', 'Many', 'have', 'complained', 'set', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'right', 'supposed', 'be', '1917', '18', 'time', 'battlefields', 'were', 'mass', 'mud', 'detritus', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'semi', 'pristine', 'conditions', 'only', 'nod', 'realism', 'fake', 'looking', 'skeleton', 'half', 'buried', 'soil', 'not', 'mud', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'special', 'effective', 'what', 'action', 'passes', 'quickly', 'done', 'unconvincing', 'fashion', '**Bit', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'coming', 'up**', 'also', 'couple', 'very', 'weird', 'scenes', 'including', 'Jesus', 'type', 'appearance', 'conversation', 'ghost', 'German', 'bayoneted', 'death', 'know', 'Mr', 'March', 'had', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'so', 'ghosts', 'were', 'probably', 'very', 'real', 'However', 'big', 'however', 'film', 'makers', 'wanted', 'express', 'side', 'war', 'then', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'not', 'been', 'posited', 'war', 'film', 'se.It', 'shot', 'colour', 'monochrome', 'scenes', 'original', 'WW', 'footage', 'were', 'attribute', 'real', 'colour', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'grey', 'also', 'German', 'French', 'dialogue', 'sub', 'titles', 'basic', 'stuff', 'was', 'fine', 'people', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'WW', 'films', 'Beneath', 'Hill', '60', 'Lost', 'Battalion', 'could', 'actually', 'read', 'original', 'book']",Company K

I'm guessing it was shot at the WWI site in Newville, PA, which is one of the better parts of the film.  In one combat scene, they engage some German trench raiders at night, one German being armed with that gun that looks like an MP-28 (forget the name... Irma?  Bergman?  I dunno, sumthin'...)... easily the best scene in the whole movie.  The scene where they execute German POWs a'la Band of Brothers was total BS, and makes the doughboys of the Great War look like the the Vietnam-era grunts that perpetrated the My Lai Massacre... shame on the director for allowing that to get in the movie.
