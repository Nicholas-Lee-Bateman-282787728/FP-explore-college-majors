1138781,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0012QCZ5O,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","`Vantage Point' is one of those movies that drew me by its trailer.  At a kinetic pace we see a frenetic adventure as an assassination attempt on the President takes place, while a ""double""** of him has been placed on his behalf on stage at a terrorist summit in Salamanca, Spain.  Interlocking pieces fit together to give us a composite of conspiracy and treachery.  Perhaps having high expectations I was more than a little disappointed with this mystery-thriller ride.  I generally give most movies the benefit of the doubt, for being a news junkie, I find real-life stories often inspire or scotch what we see on the screen. ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" I often quote.  This time there are definitely some credibility issues afoot.Many witnesses see the assassination attempt of  President Ashland (William Hurt).  On the platform in Plaza Mayor are two secret service agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and Taylor (Matthew Fox), overseeing all danger signs.  In the square is bearded Enrique (Eduardo Noriega).  He looks like a revolutionary, but must be a plain-clothes police officer.  When the President's double is shot, he rushes the stage.  Is it treachery?  Or is it duty?  Connected to him is Veronica (Ayelet Zurer).  Together they talk about another man.  Is she seeing someone else?  Or is he their sinister connection?  Time will tell.  She has connections with Javier (Edgar Ramirez) who must be the other man.  More ambiguity fills their conversation.Also in attendance is Howard, an American tourist with a video camera.  He's left his wife behind to tour Europe, and now he's getting everything on tape.  He meets a woman when he bumps into her little girl and offers to buy her a new ice cream cone.  Another point-of-view is provided by GNN (Global News Network) headed by program manager, Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  After the attempt, Agent Barnes bursts into their headquarters watching the tragedy on tape.  Often times what Barnes sees is hidden from us--to be revealed at a later time.  Meanwhile, one of the characters is desperately trying to get his brother released as a hostage.I have to give the film some credit for ingenuity.  They have showcased another flashy format in their approach.  Trouble is we don't really get to know the characters.  Before we get a chance to love or loathe them, the movie backs up about fifteen minutes to show us the proceedings from another's eyes.  Unlike, say 'Crash' where we truly care about the angst in people's lives, all we can do here is commiserate their situations.  (If you thought 'Crash' was too coincidental, just wait until you get a load of this.)  Tragically, this spills over into the ""whodunit"" or puzzle portion of the film's alleged draw.  If some of the narrative is meant to give us ""clues"" as to the guilty parties, it becomes a ""tacked-on"" exercise during the revelations of the denouement.  There are few ""ah-ha's"" in the resolution.I also have problems with Horace.  He captures everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on tape.  What he doesn't film on his video camera, he makes up by being there for the continuing drama.  Always at the right place at the right time.  There are lucky Pulitzer Prize winning journalists with luck less than his.  And what about the double?  I've seen Hollywood doubles, and there's a resemblance.  Sigourney Weaver or at least somebody would catch it, but, no, William Hurt's clone is on stage.  After the mayor makes a gracious speech, the President always says something.  At least, ""Gracias"".  Of course he gets shot, but what were they planning to do if he didn't get shot?  Does he do impressions of the President as well?The acting?  One of the biggest challenges I believe an actor faces is facing a tragedy.  After all, how many ways can you say, ""Oh, my Gawd!""?  Forest Whitaker gets my vote for the best in this high-tech puzzler, but Sigourney Weaver delivers her usual goods as well.  I can't say I'm inspired either way about the rest, but again I try to fit myself in their shoes:  The how to muster the awful-without-sounding-like-it actor's syndrome.With all the grandiose deception, I have to use a word I've never used before:  contrived.  Yes, I hate that deadly word, for I'd hate to be responsible for being wrong.  It's like an assassination of a movie, so I've never used it before---until now.  You have to be careful.  It's not something to use lightly.A J.P.'s Pan 2.5*'s=Mediocre-Fair(*After submitting my review, I checked out others', and I found that Jeff Vice of Salt Lakes' 'The Deseret News' used that phrase in his review.

Maybe that was a good thing because while this movie has its points I don't feel that it is as a complete story line as it is made out to be.  The best way that I can describe this movie is when you are unwrapping a present in a big box, and then you find a smaller box inside of the larger box and so on.  That is how this movie is, times 6, because of the 6 different vantage points that the film is based on.  Not until you get to the last box that you are unwrapping do you see how all of the parts fit together, and that is really what spins this movie.  There is plenty of action which keeps this films constantly moving, and one thing that I did like is when each vantage point is rolled back and the time starts over.

For me surprisingly I was stuck in the middle because the way the movie started out it was nice with a lot of action which seemed surprisingly because you usually don't start a movie off like that. The problem I have with it is after that it keeps rewinding the movie to show how what had happened started. The movie wasn't so much the problem but keep on rewinding it to show how it is set up for every seen is not a good move on my part. Maybe for one or two scenes that's fine but for everyone it just gets repetitive. I felt the storyline was good and if they had stuck with not rewind the movie they would have been a lot better off. The action was there so that was good and the acting was good to but I can understand why I was able to get this movie for so cheap.

1138794,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0012QCZ5O,Bill Garrison,"[0, 1]","Vantage Point is a slick thriller that uses a gimmick to tell an intriguing story about an attack on a terrorism summit in Spain. William Hurt is President Ashton and is about to speak to a gathered crowd in a large outdoor plaza. He's killed by two gunshots. With the crown panicked, an explosion goes off in the disance. Moments later, a large bomb detonates underneath the podium where the President had been speaking. The movie starts with the gimmick, showing the assassination and then bomb explosion from the point of view of Sigourney Weaver. Weaver is directing the coverage of the event in an control truck for the Global News Network. The movie then portrays the events of the attack from several point of views: Secret Service Agent Dennis Quaid who is just coming back on duty after being injured saving the president; Forrest Whitaker, a kind heart tourist, a spanish police officer, the president, the terrorist leader, etc. I lost track of how many points of view are utilized.This movie should be watched just for the uniqueness of the storytelling. It's not groundbreaking or earth shattering, but it should keep your interest.

I like to suspend logic and enjoy a movie, but when it gets to the silly level, I lose interest.  There are a few things here that just kill this movie.1.  The movie portrays the Secret Service as a bunch of poorly trained buffoons.  I know for a fact that this is nonsense.  These guys are highly trained specialists.  A lot of them are ex-military.  There is no way that one guy could take out over a dozen of them like portrayed in the film.  No way.2.  The worlds dumbest kid stops dead in front of a speeding ambulance and the terrorist driver swerves out of the way to avoid killing her.  Since when do terrorists worry about killing kids?3.  One of the terrorists has a cell phone with technology from the 31st century.  He can detonate bombs, activate machine guns, and shave in the morning with this thing.  The only thing missing from it was a transporter from Star Trek.4.  If kidnapping the President of the United States was that easy, G.W. Bush would have been taken out 6 years ago.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","The problem with VANTAGE POINT is that it doesn't take into consideration two very important things: the point of view of the watcher, and a believable storyline. Let me explain...Seeing a situation/crime/etc. from different points of view might be interesting to some. But if you're going to do that, you need to make sure that there are engaging points that aren't repeated ad nauseam. You might think that four or five points of view would be the maximum allowable for something like this. And you'd probably be right. But how about six? Or seven? Too many? Would you believe this one has eight?! Far, far, far too many. And they all start just about the same place, which grated on the nerves after a short while.The storyline is pretty ridiculous, too. Doppleganger Presidents. Double Secret Service agents. Terrorists who need to hire an assassin. And an ending that is pure schlock.Not being that much of a fan of Dennis Quaid didn't help matters for me either -- the only two films with him in them that I enjoyed wereEnemy MineandThe Big Easy. The rest of his movie repertoire is questionable to say the least;Jaws 3-D,Yours, Mine & Ours,The Day After Tomorrow, etc.I will say, however, that the action was fun to watch. And seeing William Hurt (Into the Wild) get shot multiple times was pretty enjoyable, too. But that's where my enjoyment stopped. Matthew Fox (Speed Racer) as agent Kent Taylor was completely miscast and unbelievable. But probably the most miscast of all the characters was Forest Whitaker. Having seen Whitaker inThe Last King of Scotland, I know what he's capable of. Here, he seemed like an overweight but athletic American out of his league carrying a video camera through Spain because ...well ...we're not sure.The big and final letdown was the ending of this film. If terrorists are prepared to kill, maim, and destroy innocent people in order to get to the President of the United States, would running over a girl stop them? I doubt that. Which made me nearly turn off the film. But we had to have a happy ending, sweet and sticky, with Quaid saving the day.

Quaid, is secret service guarding the president, while Whitaker is a tourist on vacation filming the summit. What transpires before the president is shot is as though several cameras filmed the action and then they are all rewound and watched one-by-one with them starting at 12:00. At first this is not an issue but by the fifth or sixth segment you may be ready to fast forward the movie, don't or you will miss some key dialogue.

The plot is unfolded in 4 or 5 different people's points of views. First, you'll see the motorcade of the president of the United States arrived at the scene. At about noon, he was shot. Then, a huge explosion occurred at the scene that killed a lot of people. Next, the film was rewinded to 23 minutes earlier. Then it was told in the eyes of a secret service agent, Dennis Quaid. This time the narration stopped about 15 minutes after the president was shot. It showed us what was happening after the explosion. Then the movie was turned back 23 minutes again. This time, it was told in another person point of view. Each time, it revealed a little more about the plot and action. To me, the filming and the technique are very effective. It's very suspenseful. It keeps my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.A few critics said the movie lost its momentum because when the climax was about to be reached, the movie was rewinded. Yes, the first time it was done, it irritated me a little but five minutes later I was completely satisfied. It was because more details of the plot were revealed in another person's point of view! Further, the picture moved at fast pace so the rewinding did not cause any boredom.The special effects are impressive. Especially, the explosion at the Plaza looks very real. It has some twists too.Somebody said the ending was far fetched. Yes, so are the endings of many other movies.

1138806,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0012QCZ5O,Chris Kennison,"[2, 6]","I got here fully prepared to dish this thing a 1 star stabbing, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought... there actually was a pretty good movie in here, if it weren't for the EXPERIMENTAL, it's cool to jump around timelines like MEMENTO, PULP FICTION & 21 GRAMS, film school BS that you had to put up with for the first 55 minutes.Once the film got into the point of view of President Ashton (William Hurt) the movie actually had a fairly good payoff, only to be ultimately ruined in the end, but I'll get to that. Once Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) puts his finger on the pulse of the assassination attempt and multiple bombings, after a god-awful amount of rewinds that have us watching the movie from multiple VANTAGE POINTS, the movie kicks into high gear with an exciting hotel room scene, an intense car chase and a coincidental finalle that ruined it all.The rewinds, I believe there are 6, while interesting in an EXPERIMENTAL way, fail miserably, ultimately frustrating the viewer and wishing they could fast forward to the end. Yet, when they finally got to the Presidents POV, I realized, yes, the rewinding was frustrating and disjoining, but there actually was a pretty cool movie hidden here, with doubles, double-crosses and terrorism, and once the action and answers starting kicking in, I thought... If they had just told the movie without the experimental film school junk, this could have been a cool movie.Then... of course, you throw in the coincidental ending that basically had everybody involved in the plot, and solving the plot colliding in the exact same intersection underneath an overpass. Even though, there was a crazy car chase and some guy on foot arrived at the location a good 5 minutes before guys in an ambulance, despite looking at each other back at the collisium.VANTAGE POINT is a complete mess and it's a shame because for the last 20 minutes, minus the coincidental ending, they actually entertained us... too bad there was a whole other hour there that was terrible.",2,FILM SCHOOL Rewind Time Displacement OVERKILL,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,2044,"['got', 'here', 'fully', 'prepared', 'dish', 'thing', '1', 'star', 'stabbing', 'more', 'thought', 'more', 'thought', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'were', ""n't"", 'EXPERIMENTAL', 'cool', 'jump', 'around', 'timelines', 'MEMENTO', 'PULP', 'FICTION', '21', 'GRAMS', 'film', 'school', 'BS', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'first', '55', 'minutes.Once', 'film', 'got', 'point', 'view', 'President', 'Ashton', 'William', 'Hurt', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'fairly', 'good', 'payoff', 'only', 'be', 'ultimately', 'ruined', 'end', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Once', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'Thomas', 'Barnes', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'finger', 'pulse', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'multiple', 'bombings', 'god-awful', 'amount', 'rewinds', 'have', 'watching', 'movie', 'multiple', 'VANTAGE', 'POINTS', 'movie', 'high', 'gear', 'exciting', 'hotel', 'room', 'scene', 'intense', 'car', 'chase', 'coincidental', 'finalle', 'ruined', 'all.The', 'rewinds', 'believe', 'are', '6', 'interesting', 'EXPERIMENTAL', 'way', 'fail', 'miserably', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'wishing', 'could', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'Presidents', 'POV', 'realized', 'yes', 'rewinding', 'was', 'frustrating', 'disjoining', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'hidden', 'here', 'doubles', 'double-crosses', 'terrorism', 'once', 'action', 'answers', 'starting', 'kicking', 'thought', 'had', 'just', 'told', 'movie', 'experimental', 'film', 'school', 'junk', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'movie.Then', 'course', 'throw', 'coincidental', 'ending', 'basically', 'had', 'everybody', 'involved', 'plot', 'solving', 'plot', 'colliding', 'exact', 'same', 'intersection', 'overpass', 'Even', 'was', 'crazy', 'car', 'chase', 'guy', 'foot', 'arrived', 'location', 'good', '5', 'minutes', 'guys', 'ambulance', 'looking', 'other', 'back', 'collisium.VANTAGE', 'POINT', 'complete', 'mess', 'shame', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'coincidental', 'ending', 'actually', 'entertained', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'whole', 'other', 'hour', 'was', 'terrible']",Vantage Point
1138807,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0012QCZ5O,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","I never once believed that the events of ""Vantage Point"" were possible, but the clever structure and interweaving narratives made for one hell of a fun movie. This is a story that constructs itself out of multiple viewpoints, with characters that witness and/or participate in terrorist activity. To show these viewpoints, the film consistently rewinds itself and then replays, each time focusing on different characters while gradually revealing pieces of the puzzle. I agree that this isn't very realistic, but that doesn't matter since it's more about entertainment. It's a good thing I caught on to that early on, because at a certain point, the convenient twists and implausible action sequences become too numerous to count. The ad campaign claims that eight strangers bear witness, but it's actually hard to know for sure since the segments are very intermingled. You shouldn't be counting, anyway--you'll miss out on everything.The film takes place in Spain in the city of Salamanca, where the President of the United States plans to take part in an anti-terror summit. A public statement will be given at the Plaza Mayor, where thousands of people have gathered both in support and in protest. Capturing the action for American television is camera director Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver), who demands the best footage from both crew and the reporters. Everything goes smoothly until the arrival of the President, who's immediately shot. Complete chaos ensues, which only gets worse with the sound of a distant explosion. It all comes to a grinding halt when the Plaza Mayor explodes in a gigantic fireball, killing dozens if not hundreds.At this point, the story rewinds twenty-three minutes earlier, just as it turns noon. We now focus on Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid), a member of the President's Secret Service. Because he took a bullet for the President a year earlier, he's completely unsure of himself, so much so that he relies on an anti-anxiety medication to stay under control. The other guards seem to be just as unsure, especially since he overreacts to people who reach for things in their pockets. His partner, Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox), seems to be the only one that still respects him. As they stand on the stage, Barnes notices a fluttering curtain in a building that was supposed to be cleared. Even after it turns out to be nothing, he's clearly troubled by what he's seen. He then kicks into high gear when the shot is fired; after tackling and losing a man claiming to be a Spanish police officer, and after the explosion, Barnes runs into Brooks' news van and demands to see every moment of footage. He ends up seeing something that shocks him to the core.The story rewinds again, and this time we focus on Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), a Spanish cop assigned to protect the Mayor of Salamanca. He's also set to meet his lover, Veronica (Ayelet Zurer), although he feels threatened when he sees another man holding her. This is bad because he already feels strange about what Veronica wants him to do. After a quick exchange, Enrique moves into the crowd and witnesses the President being shot. He runs on stage, only to be tackled by Barnes and arrested on the spot. After the explosion, Enrique leads the Secret Service on a chase through the streets, one that ends at an underpass spanning a busy highway. It also ends with him saying ""Surprised to see me alive?"" to an as yet unrevealed person.Once again, the story rewinds. We now meet Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), an American tourist visiting Europe for the first time. Capturing every moment on a digital camcorder, he walks around Plaza Mayor with awe in his eyes. As the summit gets underway, he notices an odd interaction with a Spanish couple, the kind that says they have something to hide from the rest of the world. He then notices strange activity in the upper floors of a building, which then leads to the President being shot. As panic takes hold, Barnes approaches Lewis and demands to see the footage he shot. Then comes the explosion, which both Lewis and his camera miraculously survive. Even more miraculous is his willingness to chase Enrique and continue recording the events--he seems awfully curious for someone who barely escaped with his life.I can't describe the remaining viewpoints simply because too much would be given away. I'm sorry to say that one of the biggest plot points was already given away in the trailers, and it relates directly to the President (William Hurt). To those of you who have seen them: you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who haven't seen them: believe me, you're better off. Be that as it may, I was greatly entertained by this film, from its enticing start to its frenetic finish. The final ten minutes of ""Vantage Point"" are fast-paced and satisfying, and they feature a lengthy car chase that's anything but realistic, a subplot about a man's missing brother, and more than a few characters running across busy streets. Best of all, it features that climactic moment when all the major viewpoints converge into a single narrative. I can't say that the story is unpredictable--that would depend on your ability to detect elaborate plot twists. What I can say is that, even if you do figure everything out too soon, you'll probably still have fun watching it.",4,Do You See What I See?,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,5323,"['never', 'once',

""Vantage Point"" was fast paced, intelligent, suspenseful, and at the same time emotional and human. Yes, a LOT depended on coincidence, but overall, it was very enjoyable.  The whole ""different points of view"" concept was interesting and made for great storytelling (I like seeing films in which total strangers end up totally intertwined), although it soon began to get repetitive, the movie's only flaw in my opinion.  It also required the viewer to pay close attention, because there were dozens of little details that could have been easily missed.  And there was so much to see: dopplegangers, explosions, accidents, assassination...I was very entertained throughout.

That's the best feature of this movie: it's very entertaining and once you start it, it's tough to put down. Being only 90 minutes, it's a quick hour-and-a-half. It also helps to know that you are going to get the story told from a handful of angles, so expect to see similar scenes running over and over, each with a few new wrinkles added.Also, expect a lot of the action scenes that are both fun to view but not very credible. My favorite - spoiler alert! - of that is when ""Thomas Barne's"" (Dennis Quaid) little blue car is totally bashed in by a huge 18-wheeler. Not only that, the car is smashed up against a brick wall. It should look like a metal pancake. Seconds later, Quaid emerges from the wreck and is running down the street like a football halfback shooting his pistol! He hardly has a scratch on him, and the limp disappears after about three strides!Whatever, it's a fun ride not to be taken seriously but as a short entertainment diversion.The twists are fun to see, too, as the same-but-similar story slowly unwinds and all the pieces finally fall into place by the end.....even though, how they do manage that is by stretching things a bit!",3,"A Real Stretch, But Entertaining",1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,1218,"['Well', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'fall', 'asleep', 'watching', 'film', 'best', 'feature', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'once', 'start', 'tough', 'put', 'down', 'Being', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'quick', 'hour-and-a-half', 'also', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'story', 'told', 'handful', 'angles', 'so', 'expect', 'see', 'similar', 'scenes', 'running', 'over', 'over', 'few', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'added.Also', 'expect', 'lot', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'view', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'favorite', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'when', 'Thomas', 'Barne', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'little', 'blue', 'car', 'totally', 'bashed', 'huge', '18-wheeler', 'Not', 'only', 'car', 'smashed', 'up', 'brick', 'wall', 'should', 'look', 'metal', 'pancake', 'later', 'Quaid', 'wreck', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'football', 'halfback', 'shooting', 'pistol', 'hardly', 'scratch', 'limp', 'three', 'strides', 'fun', 'ride', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'short', 'entertainment', 'diversion.The', 'twists', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'too', 'same-but-similar', 'story', 'slowly', 'unwinds', 'pieces', 'finally', 'fall', 'place', 'end', '..even', 'how', 'do', 'manage', 'stretching', 'things', 'bit']",Vantage Point

William Hurt plays the President of the United States in a time of Global Terror.  He attends a conference in Spain and is shot.  Dennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service Agent who is brought back for this event after being shot and nearly losing his life a year earlier.The first half of the movie shows us the event, rewinds and shows us events from another person's point of view, and does that four times (as I recall).  After that we think we have the pieces together and the movie tells its narratives as some of the previous views converge for different reasons.  I really don't want to say any more about the plot.I thought it was a pretty good and entertaining movie.  Quaid gives a solid performance as a serious, brave, but understandably tentative agent.  William Hurt is good in his smallish role.  Forest Whitaker gives the movie an emotional center.  Sigourney Weaver, Bruce McGill, Matthew Fox, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, and several others fill out a really good cast.While not a great film, it is worth seeing.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",4,A movie that plays with all your expectations and perceptions,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,1164,"['movie', 'perceptions', 'expectations', 'William', 'Hurt', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'Global', 'Terror', 'conference', 'Spain', 'shot', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Thomas', 'Barnes', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'who', 'brought', 'back', 'event', 'being', 'shot', 'nearly', 'losing', 'life', 'year', 'earlier.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'event', 'rewinds', 'events', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'four', 'times', 'recall', 'think', 'have', 'pieces', 'together', 'movie', 'narratives', 'previous', 'views', 'converge', 'different', 'reasons', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'more', 'plot.I', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Quaid', 'solid', 'performance', 'serious', 'brave', 'understandably', 'tentative', 'agent', 'William', 'Hurt', 'good', 'smallish', 'role', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'movie', 'emotional', 'center', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'Sad', 'Taghmaoui', 'Ayelet', 'Zurer', 'several', 'others', 'fill', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'cast.While', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Vantage Point

Firstly, it is too short for all the action in it yet it still tries to develop characters and that just falls flat. We get about 30 seconds of a character's background.  Secondly, the events are completely unreasonable.  The details of the terrorist attack are just non-sensical considering the amount of the security that occurs in any function involving the President.  A few terrorists kill a troop of secret service men as if those guarding the President were henchman working for Dr. Evil in an Austin Power's movie. Thirdly, no reason is ever given for why a group of hodge-podge Moroccans would kill dozens of innocent people and the President of the USA.  The characters in on the plot could or would never pull it off either.The worst aspect of the movie is the attempt to create suspense by continually rewinding the events and showing the same time period from about 6-7 different characters' ""vantage points.""  The result is that it completely disrupts any flow the movie would have and prevents viewers from connecting with any of the characters.  All-in-all it leads to only about 15 mins. worth of actual time passing in the movie's events.The ending also is illogical, not to mention the impossibility of a secret service agent in a high speed chase through unfamilar narrow streets filled with cars and pedstrians, on the sidewalk, down stairs, shifting, sliding, turning, etc and of course making cell phone calls, then getting completely smashed by a big truck and a wall, and surprise..getting out and chasing down the bad guys.",1,From My Vantage Point It is one of the Worst,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1629,"['movie', 'sports', 'all-star', 'cast', 'going', 'Firstly', 'too', 'short', 'action', 'yet', 'still', 'develop', 'characters', 'just', 'flat', 'get', '30', 'seconds', 'character', 'background', 'Secondly', 'events', 'are', 'completely', 'unreasonable', 'details', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'are', 'just', 'non-sensical', 'considering', 'amount', 'security', 'function', 'involving', 'President', 'A', 'few', 'terrorists', 'kill', 'troop', 'secret', 'service', 'men', 'guarding', 'President', 'were', 'henchman', 'working', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'Austin', 'Power', 'movie', 'Thirdly', 'reason', 'ever', 'given', 'why', 'group', 'hodge-podge', 'Moroccans', 'would', 'kill', 'dozens', 'innocent', 'people', 'President', 'USA', 'characters', 'plot', 'could', 'would', 'never', 'pull', 'off', 'either.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'movie', 'attempt', 'create', 'suspense', 'continually', 'rewinding', 'events', 'showing', 'same', 'time', 'period', '6-7', 'different', 'characters', 'vantage', 'points', 'result', 'completely', 'flow', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'prevents', 'viewers', 'connecting', 'characters', 'All-in-all', 'only', 'about', '15', 'mins', 'worth', 'actual', 'time', 'passing', 'movie', 'events.The', 'ending', 'also', 'illogical', 'not', 'mention', 'impossibility', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'unfamilar', 'narrow', 'streets', 'filled', 'cars', 'pedstrians', 'sidewalk', 'down', 'stairs', 'shifting', 'sliding', 'turning', 'etc', 'course', 'making', 'cell', 'phone', 'then', 'getting', 'completely', 'smashed', 'big', 'truck', 'wall', 'surprise..getting', 'out', 'chasing', 'down', 'bad', 'guys']",Vantage Point

1138818,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0012QCZ5O,Danielle Turchiano,"[1, 2]","The first five minutes of Vantage Point start off strong and with a bang (no pun intended), as Sigourney Weaver and a crew of news producers sit inside a control room, ready to go live with reporters on the scene of a high-profile presidential appearance in Spain. As Weaver gets into a petty squabble with one reporter (Zoe Saldana) over the tone she chose to take in a live shot, a gunshot fires, hitting the president, and the crew scrambles to cover it. The pacing picks up significantly, as it begins to match the panic-mode of the people in the square, and then comes the one-two punch of an explosion at the base of the hotel in the center of the events. Travis chooses to introduce these events-- the ones that supposedly set up the course for the whole film-- to his audience through the limited angles this crew's cameras are able to capture, and in doing so, he doesn't allow us access to all of the information just yet. The give a little, hold a lot back approach of Vantage Point shows great potential, but unfortunately it gets old quickly and just ends up frustrating the viewers.It's painfully obvious what is really going on from the first few minutes of Vantage Point-- in part because the majority of the plot is covered neatly in the promotional trailers but also due to the fact that the script is just not imaginative, and the plot is quite thin overall-- meaning, the stereotypical bad guys are the bad guys; there are no twists here.  Barry Levy, a former teacher who sold Vantage Point as his first screenplay, sets up a few points (such as the fact that the president used a double for his appearance and therefore didn't actually get shot) that-- if the film was allowed to play out past the course of the same two violent events over and over and over-- would actually offer interesting and unique commentary. It would have been great to see the ramifications after the realization that the public had been duped; it would have been something rooted in reality and just tongue-in-cheek enough to elicit smiles. Instead, Levy's sophomoric style keeps the audience five steps ahead of the movie at any given moment, eliminating any real reason to keep watching.The film is full of filler, offering the same sequences from varying angles and POVs-- from Secret Service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox), to a civilian with a video camera (Forest Whitaker) who just happens to be in the right place at the right time, to an up-and-coming terrorist (Said Taghmaoui, who is really too talented for this kind of typecasting).  Between the repetition, the slo-mo, the rewind sequences in between POVs, and the ungodly amount of running, there is no real plot-- just a whole lot of fast motion. The script must have been only twenty pages long and therefore would have made a really clever, really innovative short... or even a web series.Vantage Point boasts a huge cast of name talent, none of with whom Travis seemed to know what to do.  Only Quaid and Whitaker have backstories, as simple as they may be, because Travis instead chooses to focus on convoluted action, muddying the importance of his wide net of supporting players and making the majority of them much more expendable than they perhaps should be.  There is really nothing at stake for any of them other than ""stay alive,"" and the few attempts at character connection or dimension-- most of which are given to Whitaker-- are too on the nose, as if Levy doesn't trust his audiences enough to read facial expressions, and Travis doesn't trust his actors to give the right ones. Levy tells when he should show; when Whitaker is alone, he mutters to himself ridiculously, unrealistically, and expositionally. There are actual, audible ""Oh my Gods"" spilling from these awestruck characters' mouths, and suddenly six-foot-tall, hulking men are reduced to melodramatic seventh grade girls.  It's fitting, really, that in a film about deception, corruption, and violence, the filmmakers themselves proved to be similarly paranoid control freaks, unable to allow their actors just to do their own thing.Far too much is by ""chance"" in this film, again namely with Whitaker, who happens to stumble all wide-eyed and slack-jawed onto just about everything. Dennis Quaid, too, though, just happens to have luck and timing on his side, finding pieces of the puzzle literally one after the other just dropped at his side, which is really just typical of the arc a once-fallen hero desperate to redeem himself takes in films like Vantage Point.  Everything just comes too ""easily.""  Travis is far too distracted by manufacturing suspense to focus on the huge holes and just expects his audience to be willing to suspend their disbelief enough to join him on this ""convenient"" journey.Vantage Point's concept is clever, and its effort is certainly admirable, but it was just too big for these green filmmakers, and unfortunately they got caught up in the flashy style and eliminated all substance.  The result, which is just laughable when it isn't intended to be a comedy, would have been much more successful if it was half its length-- and at only ninety minutes, that's certainly saying something.",2,"If My Review Is Repetitive, It's Because The Film Is",1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,5175,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'start', 'off', 'strong', 'bang', 'pun',

By the film's end I was waiting for our shaky-handed, Secret Service hero to rip-off his shirt to expose a big Superman letter ""S"" on his chest! Terrorists who blithely slaughter innocent people left and right will throw everything out the window over a single child! You know a bomb has just been planted but you keep standing around talking. A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last. Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and clonks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly! But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling.

That would be interesting, except for the fact that there were too many different points of view, and not enough interesting moments happening between them. Each viewpoint is started with a few-second countdown to 12:00 P.M.. After three times, I groaned when this scene would pop up again. After three viewpoints, you just want to know who did it and you really, really don't want to see the attack again. Of all the characters in the film, only four of them are interesting enough to follow. The others just add monotony to the film. Cut their scenes out and it would have been a much smoother and exciting ride. No offense to anyone, but I would definitely cut out the little Hispanic girl from the film. She was so annoying! And when she ran out into traffic and just screamed for five minutes while the ambulance slowly came at her... just ticked me off.**Spoiler Alert**Yes, I know that without her jetting out in front of the ambulance the bad guys would have likely escaped, but it was still annoying to have to watch.**End Spoiler Alert**Another disappointment of the film for me was the Control Room scene with Sigourney Weaver. If you are the director of a live broadcast involving several world leaders, you would not be as relaxed and motionless as the people in that Control Room were in that scene.

It is a stupid movie so you would be losing nothing, but as someone else pointed out, you should be given the opportunity to know that my review does have spoilers in it.I can't believe there aren't many more 1 star reviews on this horrible movie.Wow, where do we start. Well, how about with the cell phone. It is fortunate for the free world that the bad guy hadn't completely read the owners manual because it would have meant some serious trouble for the rest of us. I'm sure the phone also has the ability to remotely fly Air Force 1, make the lights go and off in every office building in Spain, and order a pizza at the same time. Controlling a sniper rifle is child's play for that thing.Do we really believe that the Secret Service is that inept? I've actually known Secret Service guys - that one lone bad guy dude at the end, THAT is the way THEY are. Talking about that super bad dude. Can anyone please explain to me why he put a mask over his face? He kills a squad of highly trained agents, then puts on his mask, kills a dozen more agents to the point where there is NO ONE LEFT (save one) and then he takes off his mask??!!!  Why put it on in the first place???!!!Then there is the ridiculous child in the movie. As someone else pointed out, these guys kill scores of innocent people but the guy has a case of consciousness at the end and rolls over his vehicle? What?? NO NO NO - a true bad guy (and this guy was) was not going to stop. Terrorists do not brake for Raccoons, squirrels, or little girls.Why was Weaver in this movie?I had no idea it was so so easy to place and transport bombs from place to place where the President was going to be. This movie has let out all of its secrets - who knew?The plot was absolutely ridiculous. These movie makers know NOTHING about security. It is true that most people don't either, but you know watching this movie that even though you may not know much about it, there is common sense. Common sense would tell you that this movie was total crap.Oh - another thing. Since when would you ever see a Russian, Chinese, or French secret service agent equivalent running through OUR streets, car jacking by simply flashing their Chinese/Russian/French badge, and firing shots into the air after a ""suspect"", who just so happens to be a policeman of OUR country. Heck not only shooting into the air but AT the suspect in a street full of innocent people. ""Our"" innocent people. Would any of us stand for that? Would any country stand for our secret service agents driving down their streets and shooting at people indiscriminately? Secondly, if one of them fires his gun half a dozen times (or was it a dozen, in all of the excitement I lost track myself) you would think they would be good enough to HIT their target. Of course the super bad dude NEVER missed. That is why I call him the ""super"" bad dude.Do not waste your time with this movie. The trailer showed great promise and I am sure that this ""could"" have been a great movie. What an utter disappointment. Even more so that people actually like this movie.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","To accompany the multiple voices I hear in my head comes the thriller VANTAGE POINT, a white-knuckle rollercoaster ride told from the--you guessed it--vantage points of several characters:  from a TV producer (Sigourney Weaver), to a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), to a tourist with a videocam (Forest Whitaker). . .to the POTUS himself (William Hurt).  I thought the constant rewinding--and replaying--of the same hectic scene (an assassination attempt on the President who is abroad in Espanol) was terrifically invigorating; different perspectives make for different realities (what appears as major to one character turns out to be inconsequential to another).The action is tight, the pacing adrenaline-fast, and the suspense and intrigue aromatically heady, as a group of terrorists perp a complicated plot involving murder and mayhem (for reasons known only to themselves, certainly not to the viewer).  It's as over the top as elephants flying to the moon on gossamer wings (for instance, access to the Prez is a snap), yet the titanic suspension of disbelief is half the fun.

1138832,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0012QCZ5O,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","There is no argument that first-time feature director Pete Travis maneuvers this 2008 action thriller with propulsive intensity throughout its surprisingly fleet ninety-minute running time, but contrivance and coincidence seem to be the two guiding forces behind the overly tricked-out screenplay by first-time screenwriter Barry L. Levy. The concept starts promisingly as it aspires to be a contemporary take onRashomon, Akira Kurosawa's classic melodrama about the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy. Under the guise of a political thriller, however, the film only replicates one part of Kurosawa's cinematic equation - showing the multiple perspectives of the participants to a traumatic event - without really addressing the complexity behind the individual perceptions. The basis of the differences in perspective lies wholly within the facts to which each participant is exposed. Consequently, Travis and Levy use the recycling gimmick to peel away components of the central assassination plot until we are left with a straight-ahead finale that is as ludicrous as it is chaotic.As just seen in Jieho Lee's even more preposterousThe Air I Breathe, Paul Haggis'Crashhas inspired yet another overly connected storyline that sacrifices any sense of realism for24-style cliffhanger plot devices. This time, the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain is the setting for an anti-terrorism summit among 150 world leaders at which U.S. President Henry Ashton is about to speak onstage. He is shot twice after which there is an explosion some distance away from the square, and then a few minutes later, a bomb explodes under the stage causing several casualties. This all occurs over a twenty-three-minute period, and it is first seen most effectively through the eyes of a CNN-type news crew led by veteran news producer Rex Brooks. Their viewpoint ends when their onsite reporter is killed in the bombing. The movie is strong in a pulpy way up to this point, but then we see the same series of events six times over. The second perspective shows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor on active duty. Just back after recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by another presidential assassination attempt a year earlier, Barnes is especially anxiety-driven during the events that unfold.The third viewpoint is that of a Spanish police officer named Enrique who may or may not have a connection to the terrorists involved. By the time we see the same events a fourth time, the novelty has genuinely worn off as we see everything again from American tourist Howard Lewis' perspective and then once again from the President himself. These particular episodes spin into an incredulous series of circumstances that lead to the final viewpoint represented by the terrorists themselves. The plot finally moves forward in time once we are privy to what all the participants experience. Performances prove to be secondary in a labyrinth thriller like this, although Dennis Quaid registers the most as the tortured and heroically persistent Barnes, and William Hurt shows true executive &eacute;lan in the surprisingly meaty role of Ashton. Forest Whitaker valiantly attempts to make the most of a no-win role as Lewis as his character becomes more far-fetched. A similar problem befalls Matthew Fox as Taylor, but Sigourney Weaver has no problem acting authoritative in a near-cameo as Brooks during the best ten minutes of the movie.An international supporting cast fills the remaining key roles expertly - Spain's Eduardo Noriega, Venezuela's &Eacute;dgar Ramirez, France's Sad Taghmaoui (Amir's driver inThe Kite Runner), and Israel's Ayelet Zurer (Avner's wife inMunich). Interestingly, while the plot could have been fodder for an anti-Bush political diatribe, the film holds back from such easy targets. The downside, however, is a murkiness in character motivation that is never really clarified beyond the basic good-versus-bad dynamics. Features on the 2008 DVD are pretty standard with Travis going solo on the film's commentary track. While he provides insight, interactive dialogue with Levy or some of the principal cast could have held more interest. The making-of featurette, ""An Inside Perspective"" runs nearly a half-hour and provides the standard back-slapping from cast and crew as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The sixteen-minute ""Plotting an Assassination"" seems repetitive even with the focus purely on the script and the characters. The seven-minute ""Coordinating Chaos"" focuses on the elaborate stunts, especially theBullitt-style car chase that was filmed in Mexico City doubling for Salamanca. A one-minute gag take (not that funny) and several trailers complete the extras.",3,"Initially Thrilling But Ultimately Ludicrous Melding of ""Rashomon"" and ""24""",1216252800,"07 17,

The concept of the movie (which is hinted at in the title) is what especially makes Vantage Point a compelling and unique film; I won't address the pattern it revolves around directly since it comes as a nice surprise, but the vantage points by which the movie progresses are very entertaining and suspenseful. Just when I thought I had figured out everything about what was going on, I was not even close. Plenty of twists, thrilling action scenes, and surprises make this movie a must-see. The acting is all tremendous as well; my only criticisms would be the tendency of the film to have parts which were incredibly unrealistic. These parts still contributed to the entertaining nature of Vantage Point, however, and so they didn't bother me much. Overall, this movie combines a unique setting with a fascinating plotline to make one solid film. I would rate Vantage Point four and a half of five stars and highly recommend seeing it.

1138834,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B0012QCZ5O,Eric L. Willard,"[0, 0]","I recently, finally got to see this movie and really liked it.Lets get the small issues that others have mentioned out of the way.Yes, the car chase was a bit over-the-top and ""Hollywood"" but if you paid attention to the character that was driving (Quaid), this is the guy that is supposed to be one of the best at what he does.Zoe Saldana's character (Reporter) that makes crass comments about her own country in her report may have made people say, ""She can't do that!"" but that is exactly what that character was doing. She made you NOT like her. So, lets give credit to the acting here and not the fact that it was a character we all wanted to punch in the face.The multiple cuts from one person's short story or ""vantage point"" was a nice way to tell this story. There is a LOT of foreshadowing in this movie. That's how they told the story. Showing you a little here and little there and you have to piece it together yourself.Example: Forest Whittaker is a tourist filming the event and is politely speaking and greeting the people on balconies. He notices right before the terrorist event that all the people on the balconies have gone inside and closed the windows. You can see in his face that he knew, something was about to happen.Sigourney Weaver's character being a strong woman, in charge of the television action as the event happens may not have been a big acting stretch for her, cuz we've seen her do this before but as her coworkers plead, ""cut the feed"" you can see in her face, she wants to keep it going but does the right thing. She cuts the feed but still records which helps Quaid later in the movie.Well made, well written and although a little over-the-top, was worth 4 stars.You don't have to watch this more than once but it is worth watching more than once to pick up on more foreshadowing and it sort of makes a game out of watching it.",4,Took a while to get to see it but liked it,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1868,"['recently', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'it.Lets', 'get', 'small', 'issues', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'way.Yes', 'car', 'chase', 'was', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Hollywood', 'paid', 'attention', 'character', 'was', 'driving', 'Quaid', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'what', 'Saldana', 'character', 'Reporter', 'crass', 'comments', 'own', 'country', 'report', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'people', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'doing', 'made', 'NOT', 'So', 'lets', 'give', 'credit', 'acting', 'here', 'not', 'fact', 'was', 'character', 'wanted', 'punch', 'face.The', 'multiple', 'cuts', 'one', 'person', 'short', 'story', 'vantage', 'point', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'LOT', 'foreshadowing', 'movie', 'how', 'told', 'story', 'Showing', 'little', 'here', 'little', 'there', 'have', 'piece', 'together', 'yourself.Example', 'Forest', 'Whittaker', 'tourist', 'filming', 'event', 'politely', 'speaking', 'greeting', 'people', 'balconies', 'right', 'terrorist', 'event', 'people', 'balconies', 'have', 'gone', 'inside', 'closed', 'windows', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'happen.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'character', 'being', 'strong', 'woman', 'charge', 'television', 'action', 'event', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'acting', 'stretch', 'cuz', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'before', 'coworkers', 'plead', 'cut', 'feed', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'keep', 'going', 'right', 'thing', 'feed', 'still', 'records', 'Quaid', 'later', 'movie.Well', 'made', 'well', 'written', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'was', 'worth', '4', 'stars.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'foreshadowing', 'sort', 'game', 'watching']",Vantage Point

Terrorists (or possibly security forces, or maybe Spanish police...I never did figure that part out) try to kill the President.  (Or maybe not. That part wasn't clear either.)

It was a very unusual movie and I didn't care much for it. The movie had to do with the President of the US speaking at a conference in Spain and an attempt to end his life. Well, the conspirators succeeded in killing a stand-in double. In any case, this murder was viewed from eight ""Vantage Points"" so you ended up seeing the same thing over and over but from different perspectives. It was an interesting idea but became tedious and failed as a movie.Watching the same thing over and over eight times was deadening, even if it was from eight different perspectives. The idea might have worked on a smaller scale, but the cast of the movie numbered in the multi-thousands and it just resembled total chaos, as it would in real life. A major task was just  remembering who the major characters were and what they had to do with the main plot. The acting was marginal. Then it got down to a long and meaningless auto chase scene (well done, I might add) and the whole thing became largely incomprehensible, at least for me. The director and his crew probably understood it perfectly, but the movie isn't made for the director.

Always a bad sign, especially if a film's only been out a month or so... but I'm a sucker for a bargain, and anyway, the cast looked good.Another giveaway for a 'stinker' is the running time. This one clocks in at only 80 minutes, suggesting it has been butchered by a despairing crew in the editing suite, who realised its flimsy one-dimensional story couldn't possibly stand up for any longer than this. Or even, indeed, that it collapsed on its weedy pencil-thin legs within 10 minutes and lay there floundering on its back like an irritating cockroach just waiting to be squished.So.. just 80 minutes long. It gets a bonus star for not wasting too much of my life.But then it loses three when you discover that the first 50 minutes of it is seeing the same sequence over and over again, from the viewpoints of different characters.Quite why this was done, or what it added to the plot, is beyond me.I thought there'd be some breathtaking double whammy at the end where, for example, they were all in it together, or that we had to piece together cleverly written clues in each segment to reveal the true shock-horror conspiracy behind the sequence of events, or something.But no. That was way beyond the hyper young fools behind this project. What you see is a flat one-dimensional storyline, with a dull seen-it-all-before car chase tagged on it at the end. And, er, that's it.None of the characters have any depth. They all do ludicrous out-of-character things at critical moments. The good guy who's really a bad guy is obvious from the moment you see him. And the plot is riddled with more holes than a bullet-riddled sieve.But just why is it so bad? Have we any more clues on this DVD?If you can bear it, I suggest you just watch a bit of the 'making of' extra on the DVD and reel back in open-mouthed horror and astonishment at the young stupid boys behind this project.A director who looks about 20 years old with a wild 'kewpie doll' orange haircut.A scriptwriter whose loving description of his masterpiece resembles that of a rather thick third-former trying to convince his teacher that his English essay isn't the crock of C-minus doggie-doo that everybody else in the class knows it is.A shedload of other young 'creatives' all doing their jobs on the set, all indulging themselves in the most criminal waste of money since the banks collapsed on both sides of the Atlantic.How in the name of God did these talentless berks get a multi-million pound budget to blow on their lamebrain schoolboy drivel?The final indignity is to watch the 'Making Of' feature and see the likes of Sigourney Weaver, who really should know better, sit there all breathless and wide-eyed and animated, desperately hyping it up as some sort of 'must-see thriller of the year', when she knows and we know and anyone with an ounce of brain cells in his bonce knows she and her fellow stars are vamping up a pile of old bilgewater... and are only babbling in this crazy manner as part of their contractual duties to promote the film.It's the best acting you'll see on this whole DVD.",2,There's no point to it at all,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,3143,"['bought', 'Vantage', 'Point', '3', 'DVDS', '15', 'sale', 'supermarket', 'bad', 'sign', 'especially', 'film', 'only', 'been', 'out', 'month', 'so', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'bargain', 'anyway', 'cast', 'looked', 'good.Another', 'giveaway', ""'stinker"", 'running', 'time', 'one', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'suggesting', 'been', 'butchered', 'despairing', 'crew', 'editing', 'suite', 'who', 'realised', 'flimsy', 'one-dimensional', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'stand', 'up', 'longer', 'even', 'indeed', 'collapsed', 'weedy', 'pencil-thin', 'legs', '10', 'minutes', 'lay', 'there', 'floundering', 'back', 'irritating', 'cockroach', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'squished.So..', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'long', 'bonus', 'star', 'not', 'wasting', 'too', 'much', 'life.But', 'then', 'three', 'when', 'discover', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'seeing', 'same', 'sequence', 'over', 'again', 'viewpoints', 'different', 'characters.Quite', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'what', 'added', 'plot', 'me.I', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'breathtaking', 'double', 'whammy', 'end', 'where', 'example', 'were', 'together', 'had', 'piece', 'together', 'cleverly', 'written', 'clues', 'segment', 'reveal', 'true', 'shock-horror', 'conspiracy', 'sequence', 'events', 'was', 'way', 'hyper', 'young', 'fools', 'project', 'What', 'see', 'flat', 'one-dimensional', 'storyline', 'dull', 'seen-it-all-before', 'car', 'chase', 'tagged', 'end', 'er', 'it.None', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'do', 'ludicrous', 'out-of-character', 'things', 'critical', 'moments', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'obvious', 'moment', 'see', 'plot', 'riddled', 'more', 'holes', 'bullet-riddled', 'sieve.But', 'just', 'why', 'so', 'bad', 'Have', 'more', 'clues', 'DVD', 'can', 'bear', 'suggest', 'just', 'watch', 'bit', ""'making"", 'extra', 'DVD', 'reel', 'back', 'open-mouthed', 'horror', 'astonishment', 'young', 'stupid', 'boys', 'project.A', 'director', 'who', '20', 'years', 'old', 'wild', 'doll', 'orange', 'haircut.A', 'scriptwriter', 'loving', 'description', 'masterpiece', 'rather', 'thick', 'third-former', 'trying', 'convince', 'teacher', 'English', 'essay', ""n't"", 'crock', 'C-minus', 'doggie-doo', 'everybody', 'else', 'class', 'is.A', 'shedload', 'other', 'young', ""'creatives"", 'doing', 'jobs', 'set', 'indulging', 'most', 'criminal', 'waste', 'money', 'banks', 'collapsed', 'sides', 'Atlantic.How', 'name', 'God', 'did', 'talentless', 'berks', 'get', 'multi-million', 'pound', 'budget', 'blow', 'lamebrain', 'schoolboy', 'drivel', 'final', 'indignity', 'watch', ""'Making"", 'feature', 'see', 'likes', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'sit', 'there', 'breathless', 'wide-eyed', 'animated', 'desperately', 'hyping', 'up', 'sort', ""'must-see"", 'thriller', 'year', 'when', 'know', 'anyone', 'ounce', 'brain', 'cells', 'bonce', 'fellow', 'stars', 'are', 'vamping', 'up', 'pile', 'old', 'bilgewater', 'are', 'only', 'babbling', 'crazy', 'manner', 'part', 'contractual', 'duties', 'promote', 'film.It', 'best', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'see', 'whole', 'DVD']",Vantage Point

One of my favorite books is Orson Scott Cards ""Ender's Shadow"", which is exactly the same story as his book ""Enders Game"" except it is told by a different character. While ""Vantage Point"" doesn't rise anywhere near to the books I just mentioned, I like that looking from different viewpoints and vantage points can make a story quite different. In this film, it was interesting trying to figure out who were the bad guys before you see for yourself, and it had the effect of going to a criminal trial, and hearing testimony from different individuals to get at the truth. If that sounds like fun to you, then you will probably like this as well.On the downside, the story that turned out to be the actual events was quite convoluted, and pretty implausible.

""Vantage Point"" merely shows the same event as seen by different people, the only difference being what they happened to see or be exposed to.  As such it is a presentation/storytelling technique, not a philosophical statement.With that out of the way, I actually thought ""Vantage Point"" was better than I had expected.

I guess just giving us that was enough to convince us of their ""badness"") Plan an elaborate terrorist attack (If these people do have this kind of planning then God help us all!) with a multi national group with an end aim that is just as unexplained as the actual goals of the organisation itself.  Running chase, so called twist to the tale, not so subtle hints as to who the bad guys are and you pretty much have the plot (Not that there is much of one)  We are even given a moving speech from the president who refuses to retaliate to the bomb attack with a military strike because that would be ""Just what these people want"" and encourages his advisers to stick with the conference (Was this supposed to be some kind of ""What could have been"" Post 9/11) Either way it becomes a mute point when his advisers get gunned down 2 seconds later.Difficult to have anything positive to say about this film.

So let me simply point out some side oddities.- A speech by the president of the USA, the mayor of Madrid, and several international dignataries is set in the boxed, sniper-friendly environment of Plaza Mayor, with hundreds of private balconies looking directly at close range into the  main stage, a logistical and security nightmare.- American secret service personnel can boss around Spanish civilians and law enforcement alike, just by shouting ""policia"" (with the stress in the wrong syllable) and waving a gun. They can adventure way outside they retinue and chase civilians who are clearly Spanish, even engage in a high-speed chase of a Spanish police car, but no one of the abundant local police or snipers hinders them in any way.By the way, it is possible to sustain a 10-minute car chase in the streets (and walkays) of Madrid without braking one single time, and without running over a single pedestrian.- Spain has only one street, that ends in the country's only one highway. And all walking paths of every important character end, also, in one precise point of that highway.- Terrorists able to devise very sophisticated plans, prove to be incredibly stupid in key, very simple parts of their execution.Also, they can act ruthlessly and fanatically all the time, but have isolated pangs of conscience for no other reason than to suit the plot.Finally, being almost all of them Spaniards, they will speak some Spanish among themselves to add local color, but then suddenly switch to English for no apparent reason.Trained and motivated terrorists are so scarce, that the only guy available for the heavy duty work has to be coerced into it by unverisimilar means. And, aside from his incredible killing efficiency, he's pretty stupid otherwise.- American secret servicemen in the middle of a national security crisis of epic proportions have time to peek around the inside of vehicles on a car crash, for no apparent reason.The premise of the movie is repeating the same series of events from the point of view of several protagonists.As the perspectives add up, the plot is supposed to start ""making sense"".But these and many other inconsistencies seriously attempt against any credibility of the plot.",2,Silly,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,2320,"['difficult', 'explain', 'how', 'extremely', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'movie', 'spoiling', 'So', 'let', 'simply', 'point', 'out', 'side', 'oddities.-', 'speech', 'president', 'USA', 'mayor', 'Madrid', 'several', 'international', 'dignataries', 'set', 'boxed', 'sniper-friendly', 'environment', 'Plaza', 'Mayor', 'hundreds', 'private', 'balconies', 'looking', 'directly', 'close', 'range', 'main', 'stage', 'logistical', 'security', 'nightmare.-', 'American', 'secret', 'service', 'personnel', 'can', 'boss', 'Spanish', 'civilians', 'law', 'enforcement', 'alike', 'just', 'shouting', 'policia', 'stress', 'wrong', 'syllable', 'waving', 'gun', 'can', 'adventure', 'way', 'retinue', 'chase', 'civilians', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'Spanish', 'even', 'engage', 'high-speed', 'chase', 'Spanish', 'police', 'car', 'one', 'abundant', 'local', 'police', 'snipers', 'hinders', 'way.By', 'way', 'possible', 'sustain', '10-minute', 'car', 'chase', 'streets', 'Madrid', 'braking', 'one', 'single', 'time', 'running', 'over', 'single', 'pedestrian.-', 'Spain', 'only', 'one', 'street', 'country', 'only', 'one', 'highway', 'walking', 'paths', 'important', 'character', 'end', 'also', 'one', 'precise', 'point', 'highway.-', 'Terrorists', 'able', 'devise', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'plans', 'prove', 'be', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'key', 'very', 'simple', 'parts', 'execution.Also', 'can', 'act', 'ruthlessly', 'fanatically', 'time', 'have', 'isolated', 'pangs', 'conscience', 'other', 'reason', 'suit', 'plot.Finally', 'being', 'almost', 'Spaniards', 'will', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'add', 'local', 'color', 'then', 'suddenly', 'switch', 'English', 'apparent', 'reason.Trained', 'motivated', 'terrorists', 'are', 'so', 'scarce', 'only', 'guy', 'available', 'heavy', 'duty', 'work', 'be', 'coerced', 'unverisimilar', 'means', 'aside', 'incredible', 'killing', 'efficiency', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'otherwise.-', 'American', 'secret', 'servicemen', 'middle', 'national', 'security', 'crisis', 'epic', 'proportions', 'have', 'time', 'peek', 'around', 'inside', 'vehicles', 'car', 'crash', 'apparent', 'reason.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'repeating', 'same', 'series', 'events', 'point', 'view', 'several', 'perspectives', 'add', 'up', 'plot', 'supposed', 'start', 'making', 'sense', 'many', 'other', 'inconsistencies', 'seriously', 'attempt', 'credibility', 'plot']",Vantage Point

The difference in this thriller from the many others of the same genre is the use of telling the story from at least five different vantage points - the news reporters (Sigourney Weaver, Zo Saldana and Staff), the CIA (Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, et al with William Hurt as the President), a group of terrorists, an American bystander with camera (Forest Whitaker), and the viewing public.  Things are not as they initially seem and the more times the story is rerun through repetition of the incident, the more information is added.Based on a story by Barry Levy and directed by Pete Travis the film could become tiresome in its use of repeated reruns, but given the quality of the cast and the twists and turns as the 'plot' is further elucidated makes the story more of an investigation of Intelligence forces from all involved countries and drives home the reason 'terrorism' is so terrifying.  Some of the peripheral cast members are particularly fine - Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui,  Ayelet Zurer, and Eduardo Noriega among others.

The attempted assassination of the President of the United States is told from several different points of view until all the pieces come together. Members of the cast include Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.In this ensemble piece, the editing and pacing of the movie was very strong. The car chase scene was one of the better ones I've seen, it was very exciting and engaging. Some of the twists and turns in the plot were very predictable but others were pretty enjoyable. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to solve it before they come out and tell you what happened. It almost reminded me of the first few episodes of ""Lost"" where each character's perspective of where they were and what they were doing when the plane crashed ending with something suspenseful. Eventually it all converges on the same city block.On the flip side of that, I think too many perspectives were used. Usually about three is a good number to go with in telling different versions of a story, beyond that it gets a little cluttered and unorganized. At the fourth time, I was like, ""Really? We're going back to 11:59am AGAIN?"" Despite all that, it only has a 90 minute running time because the back story on characters is very brief and given through conversations so it all mostly converges on the assassination attempt and aftermath.Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana are very underutilized in this film. They show up in the beginning to show the newscasters' perspective of the events with Saldana as a reporter trying to throw her own commentary on the event along with the news and Weaver shutting her down as the editor. This leads into Quaid's back story of his Secret Service Agent career with Matthew Fox.Forest Whitaker plays a tourist watching the whole slew of events through his camcorder and he veers between awestruck delight at his surroundings to distressed terror and determination for some reason to run down the bad guys and try to capture all the evidence he can with his camera. Granted, he does capture many relevant moments in footage, but the average tourist of his size risking his life is pretty surprising since he isn't an off-duty Jack Bauer or anything. William Hurt's performance as the President is very brief (like many performances in the film) and he mostly fiddles with paperwork and rides in cars.Matthew Fox's performance was the most predictable with no surprises whatsoever. He plays the same stubborn guy he plays in ""Lost"" but as a Secret Service Agent instead of a surgeon. I would be so relieved if Jack on ""Lost"" somehow got offed in this last season. I could care less who Kate chooses, I think the biggest surprise would be if she chose Claire instead of Jack or Sawyer.All in all, this is an exciting thriller with very short performances and maybe a few too many versions to the story, but edited together very well.",3,"""Vantage Point"" tells an interesting story from too many perspectives",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,3004,"['Vantage', 'Point', 'was', 'directed', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'written', 'Barry', 'Levy', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'told', 'several', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'Members', 'cast', 'include', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver.In', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'editing', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'were', 'very', 'predictable', 'others', 'were', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'trying', 'solve', 'come', 'out', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'almost', 'reminded', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Lost', 'where', 'character', 'perspective', 'where', 'were', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'plane', 'crashed', 'ending', 'something', 'suspenseful', 'Eventually', 'converges', 'same', 'city', 'flip', 'side', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'perspectives', 'were', 'used', 'Usually', 'three', 'good', 'number', 'go', 'telling', 'different', 'versions', 'story', 'little', 'cluttered', 'unorganized', 'fourth', 'time', 'was', 'Really', ""'re"", 'going', 'back', '11:59am', 'AGAIN', 'only', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'very', 'brief', 'given', 'conversations', 'mostly', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'aftermath.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'are', 'very', 'underutilized', 'film', 'show', 'up', 'beginning', 'show', 'newscasters', 'perspective', 'events', 'Saldana', 'reporter', 'trying', 'throw', 'own', 'commentary', 'event', 'news', 'Weaver', 'shutting', 'down', 'editor', 'Quaid', 'back', 'story', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'career', 'Matthew', 'Fox.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'tourist', 'watching', 'whole', 'slew', 'events', 'camcorder', 'awestruck', 'delight', 'surroundings', 'distressed', 'terror', 'determination', 'reason', 'run', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'try', 'capture', 'evidence', 'can', 'camera', 'Granted', 'capture', 'many', 'relevant', 'moments', 'footage', 'average', 'tourist', 'size', 'risking', 'life', 'pretty', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'off-duty', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'anything', 'William', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'President', 'very', 'brief', 'many', 'performances', 'film', 'mostly', 'paperwork', 'rides', 'cars.Matthew', 'Fox', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'predictable', 'surprises', 'whatsoever', 'same', 'stubborn', 'guy', 'Lost', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'instead', 'surgeon', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'relieved', 'Jack', 'Lost', 'somehow', 'got', 'offed', 'last', 'season', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'who', 'Kate', 'think', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'would', 'be', 'chose', 'Claire', 'instead', 'Jack', 'Sawyer.All', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'very', 'short', 'performances', 'maybe', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'versions', 'story', 'edited', 'together', 'very', 'well']",Vantage Point

The scene of the assassination of the stand-in US President is reminiscent of St. Peter's Square, where Pope John Paul II was shot in 1981. The different viewpoints of what took place are reminiscent of the conflicting accounts of the assassination of JFK in 1963, which, of course, has encouraged conspiracy theories.Is this flick designed to encourage Islamophobia? I think not. The real US President makes a statement in which he makes it clear that the 5 terrorists from Morocco should not be conflated with the 6 million peaceful citizens of that nation. He also realizes that the terrorists hope to provoke a US retaliation that would only antagonize peaceful Arabs.Parts of the plot are farfetched: The assassins are totally successful, never make a mistake, and never encounter a serious obstacle to their plans. The car chasers encounter crash after crash without getting killed. A terrorist spins the car he is driving out of control in order to avoid hitting a little girl on the road.

1138853,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0012QCZ5O,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","'Vantage Point' a solid film. It's a fast-paced, action-political thriller that reaches out to those who enjoy gun fights and car chases but want substance when it comes to the plot and characters. The film centers on the story of the attempted assassination of the American president just as he's about to address a peace conference in Spain. We see the perspective of eight people caught up in the events, from the terrorists themselves to CIA agents to ordinary citizens, with each person holding a piece of the puzzle that comes neatly together to deliver the end result.The cast all succeed in their roles, which wasn't easy considering they couldn't rely on interaction with other characters to hold them up and so much of the film relies on each actor delivering their part of the story in a solid manner. Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker were both excellent in their respective roles as two men who are heroes in different ways while Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer and Edgar Ramirez did well in providing the backbone of the film. Since the film rewinds several times there is little room for characterization, the only attempts at this were brief and focused on Forest Whitaker and Dennis Quaid'Vantage Point' took a plot and portrayed it in a unique approach, which is partially why I felt it was so entertaining. It kept me on tenterhooks throughout, especially as I waited to see how each character fitted into the story (although, such a way of filming could bore audiences fast if other films decided to copy). While the actual plot was a tad unrealistic and wrapped up in a too convenient manner, I think we accept that this is the norm for most actions films and that is part of what makes them fun. We see enough realism in the news, after all. And the action scenes are shot for maximum entertainment, particularly the car chase which was thrilling without dragging on. Overall, this is an enjoyable film, an intelligent action flick that is short and sweet. It's also of the few films these days which addresses the terrorism threat to the Western World without spoon feeding us some over-emphasized point or descending into anti-Americanism.

Jongeling ""slice of heaven""","[1, 2]","Previews looked interesting, and the whole idea of figuring out who the culprit was by piecing together all of the different ""points"" of view intrigued me, so I decided to pick this up for a rental.I couldn't quite figure out what was going on in the beginning, it was fairly vague...something to do with the president, a Spanish leader, and maybe the Pope? I didn't know for sure. This was actually okay, because I got to see it over again in a few minutes from another perspective. And another. And another. And another. You basically see the first ten minutes of the movie about four or five times over, like a crash course in redundancy.Thankfully, the movie stops chasing its own tail and progresses forward to show us who the nameless faceless characters are, and who is really in on the 'deal'.Except, nobody really tells you what the 'deal' is. By the end of the movie you are left scratching your head to what this whole movie was actually about. It's a false execution, a snatching of the president, some dumbfounded SS agents, and a bunch of Spanish activists that are on some violent mission of some sort to prove something. And while all of this is happening, I'm expecting some grand unveiling of what it's all about - and it never happens. Just a mess of confusion and people shooting at each other. The movie falsely climaxes at the end with a few dead people, no real resolution, and little explanation of anything. Characters are mentioned but never shown or talked about (such as the 'brother' that dolt is shouting about towards the end), and this 'Mayor' that apparently is so important to the guy who is running from SS for half of the movie (I couldn't tell if he was actually a good guy or a bad guy). And nevermind the camcorder footage - it really doesn't mean anything at all, as it turns out.Now, about the acting...Dennis Quaid over-acts as usual, trying to strike fear with his dramatic tone of voice and inability to handle stressful situations. (he's one of the most agitating actors to me, but that's another story)Forest Whittaker must have had the easiest job in the world for this film - a philanthropic soul with a video camera on vacation in Spain, taking in the sights and sounds...meeting a little girl and spilling her ice cream, then miraculously saving her life after all of the bad stuff goes down... honestly they could have used anyone that's starred in a B-movie for this role.Sigourney Weaver is almost absent, her largest role being the first ten minutes directing TV anchors to get the best shot. Really, someone send an alien down to make this movie more interesting. The other people I don't even remember, that's how memorable they were.Ultimately, ""Vantage Point"" is a fail.

1138857,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B0012QCZ5O,Joe Carugati,"[1, 3]","""Vantage Point"" is a film that I really had no prior knowledge of. The only thing I knew was that it dealt with a presidential assassination and that it was told from different perspectives, but that was it. I went into the theater with an open mind and came out let down. For as much as director Pete Travis milks the gimmick of showing an assassination from different views, he never really finds a way to make it riveting, exciting, or truly entertaining.President Ashton (William Hurt) of the United States comes to Spain to speak at a terrorism summit. As he's about to make his speech, shots ring out and the President is on the ground. The entire film then focuses on certain people in the area, who either witnessed or planned the attack. From a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) to a tourist (Forest Whitaker), each view is shown before, during, and after the assassination, which pieces the clues together about who is responsible and why they are doing it.For a film like ""Vantage Point"" to work, it needs to be smart. Unfortunately, it's not. By throwing many paper-thin characters into the mix, the writer probably tried to confuse the viewer and make everything seem complex, when all the while it's quite simple. As the movie progressed, I would call what would happen next and who the bad guys were. Almost 95% of the time I was right and it really just made the film seem lazy.The characters in the film were fairly one-dimensional. Luckily, a solid cast was there to make them slightly interesting. In my mind, Dennis Quaid is one of the most underrated actors in film. He seems to make every film he's in better than it should be (even ""Jaws 3-D""). Even though I would have liked more development with his character, he does a great job and makes his scenes the most interesting. Poor Matthew Fox. ""You know what's interesting about him? ...Nothing."" Oh, how right Seth Rogen was in ""Knocked Up"". The same can be said for his performance. William Hurt does a fine job with what he had to do. Not much was required. Forest Whitaker didn't do much for me, which is disappointing due to how much I enjoyed him in ""The Last King of Scotland"". He had a lot of ""off"" moments throughout the film. And, Sigourney Weaver...she picked up a paycheck.The idea of different perspectives to show one occurrence is interesting, but it's not executed properly. First, by having so many characters, the audience cannot relate with anyone in the film. With less perspectives, there would be more time for character development, which would have benefited this film. Secondly, the director cheats the audience by not giving the true perspective of each individual. For instance, a character may have been nowhere near the assassination, but when the shots are heard, they cut away to a scene of the president being shot. If the character is not allowed to see the incident visually, neither should the audience. In a way, it's like breaking the fourth wall and it takes you out of the film. Finally, as each story progresses, one can tell that the director is leaving out certain clues that the audience is not allowed to pick up until later in the film. If a character sees something that shocks them or makes them run away, the director may hold out on what they saw until the end so that the audience will be even more shocked supposedly. Again, this doesn't work for me, because we, the audience, are supposed to see their perspectives and by not showing the catalyst of their actions, it's breaking the promise that the film gave to the viewers.Overall, ""Vantage Point"" is a forgettable thriller. Nothing stands out to separate it from anything else being offered in film these days. It's unfortunate, because it could have been much better. If the characters had been more developed, the writing and direction tighter, the gimmick better executed, and the conclusion more satisfying, we would have had a solid film on our hands.",2,Vantage Point,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,3936,"['Vantage', 'Point', 'film', 'really', 'had', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'only', 'thing', 'knew', 'was', 'presidential', 'assassination', 'was', 'told', 'different', 'perspectives', 'was', 'went', 'theater', 'open', 'mind', 'came', 'out', 'let', 'down', 'as', 'much', 'director', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'gimmick', 'showing', 'assassination', 'different', 'views', 'never', 'really', 'way', 'make', 'riveting', 'exciting', 'truly', 'entertaining.President', 'Ashton', 'William', 'Hurt', 'United', 'States', 'Spain', 'speak', 'terrorism', 'summit', 'make', 'speech', 'shots', 'ring', 'out', 'President', 'ground', 'entire', 'film', 'then', 'certain', 'people', 'area', 'who', 'witnessed', 'planned', 'attack', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'tourist', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'view', 'shown', 'before', 'assassination', 'clues', 'together', 'who', 'responsible', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'film', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'work', 'be', 'smart', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'throwing', 'many', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'mix', 'writer', 'probably', 'tried', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'make', 'everything', 'seem', 'complex', 'when', 'quite', 'simple', 'movie', 'progressed', 'would', 'call', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'Almost', '95', '%', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'really', 'just', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'lazy.The', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'Luckily', 'solid', 'cast', 'was', 'there', 'make', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'mind', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'film', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'even', 'Jaws', '3-D', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'development', 'character', 'great', 'job', 'scenes', 'most', 'interesting', 'Poor', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'know', 'what', 'interesting', 'Nothing', 'Oh', 'how', 'right', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'was', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'performance', 'William', 'Hurt', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'Not', 'much', 'was', 'required', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'disappointing', 'due', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'had', 'lot', 'moments', 'film', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'picked', 'up', 'paycheck.The', 'idea', 'different', 'perspectives', 'show', 'one', 'occurrence', 'interesting', 'not', 'executed', 'properly', 'First', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'anyone', 'film', 'less', 'perspectives', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'film', 'Secondly', 'director', 'audience', 'not', 'giving', 'true', 'perspective', 'individual', 'instance', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'nowhere', 'assassination', 'when', 'shots', 'are', 'heard', 'cut', 'away', 'scene', 'president', 'being', 'shot', 'character', 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'incident', 'visually', 'should', 'audience', 'way', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'film', 'Finally', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'leaving', 'out', 'certain', 'clues', 'audience', 'not', 'allowed', 'pick', 'up', 'later', 'film', 'character', 'something', 'run', 'away', 'director', 'may', 'hold', 'out', 'what', 'saw', 'end', 'so', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'supposedly', 'Again', ""n't"", 'work', 'audience', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'perspectives', 'not', 'showing', 'catalyst', 'actions', 'breaking', 'promise', 'film', 'gave', 'viewers.Overall', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'forgettable', 'thriller', 'Nothing', 'out', 'separate', 'anything', 'else', 'being', 'offered', 'film', 'days', 'unfortunate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'developed', 'writing', 'direction', 'tighter', 'gimmick', 'better', 'executed', 'conclusion', 'more', 'satisfying', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'solid', 'film', 'hands']",Vantage Point

Peters,"[2, 2]","Sometimes it's hard to judge a movie based on reviews and then choose whether or not to see/rent/buy it, since people can post such opposite comments about the same film.  It is my hope that my review will be objective enough to help you make a valid determination before you expend time and money on it.The plot summary on the DVD case reads: ""During a historic counter-terrorism summit in Spain, the President of the United States is struck down by an assassin's bullet.  Eight strangers have a perfect view of the kill, but what did they really see?  As the minutes leading up to the fatal shot are replayed through the eyes of each witness, the reality of the assassination takes shape.  But just when you think you know the answer, the shattering truth is finally revealed.  VANTAGE POINT is a mindbending political action-thriller starring Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox...Forest Whitaker...with Sigourney Weaver and...William Hurt..."" [ellipses mine]Special features on the one-disc version include: ""Surveillance Tapes: Outtake""; ""An Inside Perspective: Interviews with the Cast & Crew""; ""Plotting an Assassination""; ""Coordinating Chaos: Stunt Featurette""; and ""Commentary with Director Pete Travis.""  I happened to watch three of the five, and I found them to be entertaining and worth seeing.  None that I watched were more than about 10 minutes long.Having looked over some of the reviews for this movie (after I saw it), it seems that the two main aspects of the film that will likely make or break it for viewer are:  the ""rewinding"" of the movie 6 or 7 times (I didn't actually count) to show the same block of time and series of events from different points of view; and the extreme improbability of certain technical and action aspects of the movie.I think your enjoyment level for this movie, then, will depend largely on what your expectations are.  If you want action, suspense, and intrigue, you certainly will not be disappointed.  I was looking for entertainment, and I found it in a big way in this movie.  If, however, you want the kind of movie where all technical elements and action sequences have to be reasonable, plausible, and precise, then you will certainly find aspects of the movie to be a disappointment or distraction and maybe even detract from the overall enjoyment.  A few examples to illustrate:  (1) The Secret Service agents who guard the President are just too easily eliminated by the bad guys.  (2) There is a pivotal moment in the movie (no spoilers here) when some chief bad guys have a pang of conscience that affects the plot's outcome in a major way.  (3) One of the terrorists has a cell phone that can do things no cell phone actually can.  (4) Dennis Quaid's character drives his car in an incredible chase scene that simply could never happen in real life without catastrophic damage to property and life.  The movie also does not seek to accomplish complex character development, but I do think the viewer will find enough of an emotional connection to the characters played by Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker in particular.I personally found the movie to be a non-stop thrill, and it was one of the best action films I have seen in quite awhile.  Several well-known actors in the cast helped!  I also liked the ""rewinding"" of the movie so the events could be told from another perspective. I completely agree with the plot summary on the DVD case in that just when I thought I had figured out what was really going on, a different point of view was introduced that put a whole new twist on things.  I do agree with a few of the observations pointed out by the one-star reviewers who draw attention to the technical flaws and implausible elements.  For me, though, they were in no way fatal to the movie, and I was willing and able to look beyond them.Unless you tend to be rather demanding of movies in terms of expecting technical flawlessness, I would find it hard to imagine that you could watch this movie and genuinely be disappointed.  Just for another perspective, I watched it with my two boys, ages 11 and 13, and they both were utterly impressed with it.I give this movie five stars only because I can't give four-and-a-half.  Why not a solid five?  Simply to acknowledge that the technical flaws and implausible elements are there.  Had the writer and director been a little more creative in making these aspects more believable, I would not hesitate to rate this movie a solid five stars.",5,Action and Suspense from Start to Finish!,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,4453,"['Sometimes', 'hard', 'judge', 'movie', 'based', 'reviews', 'then', 'choose', 'not', 'see/rent/buy', 'people', 'can', 'post', 'such', 'opposite', 'comments', 'same', 'film', 'hope', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'objective', 'enough', 'help', 'make', 'valid', 'determination', 'expend', 'time', 'money', 'it.The', 'plot', 'summary', 'DVD', 'case', 'historic', 'counter-terrorism', 'summit', 'Spain', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'struck', 'down', 'assassin', 'bullet', 'Eight', 'strangers', 'have', 'perfect', 'view', 'kill', 'what', 'did', 'really', 'see', 'minutes', 'leading', 'up', 'fatal', 'shot', 'are', 'replayed', 'eyes', 'witness', 'reality', 'assassination', 'shape', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'answer', 'shattering', 'truth', 'finally', 'revealed', 'VANTAGE', 'POINT', 'mindbending', 'political', 'action-thriller', 'starring', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'William', 'Hurt', '[', 'mine', ']', 'Special', 'features', 'one-disc', 'version', 'include', 'Surveillance', 'Tapes', 'Outtake', 'Inside', 'Perspective', 'Interviews', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'Plotting', 'Assassination', 'Coordinating', 'Chaos', 'Stunt', 'Featurette', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'happened', 'watch', 'three', 'five', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'seeing', 'None', 'watched', 'were', 'more', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'long.Having', 'looked', 'reviews', 'movie', 'saw', 'two', 'main', 'aspects', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'break', 'viewer', 'are', 'rewinding', 'movie', '6', '7', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'count', 'show', 'same', 'block', 'time', 'series', 'events', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'extreme', 'improbability', 'certain', 'technical', 'action', 'aspects', 'movie.I', 'think', 'enjoyment', 'level', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'depend', 'largely', 'what', 'expectations', 'are', 'want', 'action', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'certainly', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'found', 'big', 'way', 'movie', 'however', 'want', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'technical', 'elements', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'be', 'reasonable', 'plausible', 'precise', 'then', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'aspects', 'movie', 'be', 'disappointment', 'distraction', 'maybe', 'even', 'detract', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'few', 'examples', 'illustrate', '1', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'who', 'guard', 'President', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'easily', 'eliminated', 'bad', 'guys', '2', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'movie', 'spoilers', 'here', 'when', 'chief', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'pang', 'conscience', 'plot', 'outcome', 'major', 'way', '3', 'One', 'terrorists', 'cell', 'phone', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'cell', 'phone', 'actually', 'can', '4', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'character', 'car', 'incredible', 'chase', 'scene', 'simply', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'catastrophic', 'damage', 'property', 'life', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'seek', 'accomplish', 'complex', 'character', 'development', 'do', 'think', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'enough', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'particular.I', 'personally', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'awhile', 'Several', 'well-known', 'actors', 'cast', 'helped', 'also', 'liked', 'rewinding', 'movie', 'events', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'perspective', 'completely', 'agree', 'plot', 'summary', 'DVD', 'case', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'introduced', 'put', 'whole', 'new', 'twist', 'things', 'do', 'agree', 'few', 'observations', 'pointed', 'out', 'one-star', 'reviewers', 'who', 'draw', 'attention', 'technical', 'flaws', 'implausible', 'elements', 'though', 'were', 'way', 'fatal', 'movie', 'was', 'willing', 'able', 'look', 'them.Unless', 'tend', 'be', 'rather', 'demanding', 'movies', 'terms', 'expecting', 'technical', 'flawlessness', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'imagine', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Just', 'perspective', 'watched', 'two', 'boys', '11', '13', 'were', 'utterly', 'impressed', 'it.I', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'four-and-a-half', 'Why', 'not', 'solid', 'five', 'Simply', 'acknowledge', 'technical', 'flaws', 'implausible', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'Had', 'writer', 'director', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'making', 'aspects', 'more', 'believable', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'rate', 'movie', 'solid', 'five', 'stars']",Vantage Point

Although there are some points that leave you wondering and seem a little campy, the movie overall has a unique twist to it.You are seeing from about six different vantage points or points of view what was happening in an assassination attempt on the US president in Spain.  He is there for an anti-terrorist conference with over 100 nations present both east and west.  What is interesting about this way of doing the movie is that you get a lot of information about a very short period of time from the perspective of 6 or more individuals.  The story comes out as to who is involved and how with the rewinding and viewing from the perspective of the newsroom, a couple of terrorists, a bystander, the president himself, and a member of the Secret Service.It would be impossible and way too choppy to have had all of these scenes from all angles if the movie was layed out like a typical piece.  Here is like the peeling back of an onion, each layer is an onion but a little different.  By doing this, we get a full picture and are left with an answer to what just happened.  Which is a question that Sigorney Weaver asks before the first rewind.There are blasts that you hear in the distance, you get the answer for that, about half way through.  The last sequence is a coallecsing of scenes when we are taken on a spectacular car chase through the streets of Salamanca.

A suspected terrorist is running for his very life through the streets of Madrid, and a team of crack Secret Service agents in top physical condition are chasing him on foot--for blocks and blocks, through high speed traffic and up and down the sides of buildings.  And there's Forest Whitaker, bringing up the rear all right, but only slightly, a camcorder glued to his eye, not even breathing hard.  He just keeps going and going, this tubby guy, he's like the energizer beach ball.  I just didn't believe that Forest Whitaker of all people was up for the role of persistent sprinter.  Why not get Lance Armstrong or someone?  Did they hope to take advantage of Whitaker's acting talents?  He didn't take them on location, must have left them back at home in the USA.They must have had Sigourney Weaver for fifteen minutes; she's on the screen so little I was convinced this was an elaborate coverup and that Forest Whitaker would pause, duck behind a Moorish pillar, and strip off the Forest makeup as emerge as Ripley from Alien.

Protesters are roped off on a side area.The first scene of the assassination is the news center with television news Producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  We watch as she is surprised to see Secret Service Agent Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who recently took a bullet for the President - back on duty with darting eyes focusing on a second story window where a curtain moves.  The President is shot twice -  then we hear a small explosion and then a massive blast.  Rex's news anchor dies before her and the TV audience.  Somehow Agent Barnes gets to the news center and rewinds the film and sees a clue.  Then he runs off again.Then the film rewinds over and over to just before noon on that fateful day.  It becomes tedious but you get a new clue with each rewind.  This gimmick did not help the movie (the movie could have covered the plot in 30 minutes).  You had to relive the blast and gunshots way too many times.  The plot was too convoluted.  When the movie finished you wonder why so many reruns and far-fetched twists?",2,Farfetched Twists,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,1327,"['Multiple', 'points', 'view', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'tell', 'Presidential', 'assassination', 'attempt.U.S', 'president', 'Ashton', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Salamanca', 'Spain', 'announce', 'plans', 'major', 'global', 'summit', 'terrorism', 'U.S.', 'President', 'podium', 'front', 'shouting', 'crowd', 'large', 'plaza', 'Protesters', 'are', 'roped', 'off', 'side', 'area.The', 'first', 'scene', 'assassination', 'news', 'center', 'television', 'news', 'Producer', 'Rex', 'Brooks', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'watch', 'surprised', 'see', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'Barnes', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'recently', 'took', 'bullet', 'President', 'back', 'duty', 'darting', 'eyes', 'focusing', 'second', 'story', 'window', 'where', 'curtain', 'moves', 'President', 'shot', 'twice', 'then', 'hear', 'small', 'explosion', 'then', 'massive', 'blast', 'Rex', 'news', 'anchor', 'TV', 'audience', 'Somehow', 'Agent', 'Barnes', 'news', 'center', 'film', 'clue', 'Then', 'again.Then', 'film', 'just', 'before', 'noon', 'fateful', 'day', 'tedious', 'get', 'new', 'clue', 'rewind', 'gimmick', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'movie', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'plot', '30', 'minutes', 'had', 'relive', 'blast', 'gunshots', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'convoluted', 'When', 'movie', 'finished', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'reruns', 'far-fetched', 'twists']",Vantage Point

Naturally, GNN (Global Network News) has a huge crew on the scene.  The on the ground producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) is trying to keep things running smoothly.  Just as President Ashton (William Hurt) steps up to the stage, he is shot.  As the jittery crowd begins to react, there is an explosion.Back up to the beginning of the events.  Two secret service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox) are at the President's hotel.  They accompany him to the town square and are standing on stage.  Tom (Dennis Quaid) is convinced he saw something from an upstairs window.  Just as other agents report it was just a fan, the President is shot.  Tom quickly grabs the camera of a tourist in the crowd (Forest Whitaker) to see if he captured any pertinent information while the other agent tries to catch the shooter who they think was in a different window.Back up to the beginning of the events....They flip back and forth several times, each time giving us the events from a slightly different point of view and leaving us with another cliffhanger.  Finally, they begin to show us how all these different points of view come together.Sort of.The movie starts out using the multiple points of view well.  With each retelling of the events, we see a slightly different piece of the puzzle.  How all these events fit together is left up in the air until the end.But it's the end where the unique storytelling falls apart.  While all of our main characters play a part in the climax, only we know how.  I was a little disappointed with that because I was expecting all the characters to work together to find the solution.  Instead, coincidence ruled the day.I found the repetitive flashbacks interesting at first, but eventually annoying.  It spends an hour on stuff we already know, just giving us a small bit of new information every time.  But when we get beyond that, the pay off is worth it.  The action isn't believable, but I was glued to my seat as the climax unfolded.Here's a brief aside for you.  Part of the background color of the movie is a bunch of anti-America protesters.  That's fine.  But twice as they panned across the crowd, I clearly saw a sign that had a W crossed out.  The current US President has nothing to do with anything in the film.  Either the producers just used some footage from a protest and didn't catch that or they were trying to sneak in a political statement.  Which ever it was, I found it distracting.Distractions and flaws aside, at the end of the film, I was really glad I saw this thriller.",4,It was a Good but not Great Thriller from my Vantage Point,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2664,"['leaders', 'world', 'are', 'meeting', 'small', 'Spanish', 'town', 'summit', 'iron', 'out', 'details', 'anti-terrorism', 'treaty', 'Naturally', 'GNN', 'Global', 'Network', 'News', 'huge', 'crew', 'scene', 'ground', 'producer', 'Rex', 'Brooks', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'running', 'smoothly', 'Just', 'President', 'Ashton', 'William', 'Hurt', 'stage', 'shot', 'jittery', 'crowd', 'react', 'explosion.Back', 'up', 'beginning', 'events', 'Two', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'are', 'President', 'hotel', 'accompany', 'town', 'square', 'are', 'standing', 'stage', 'Tom', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'convinced', 'saw', 'something', 'upstairs', 'window', 'Just', 'other', 'agents', 'report', 'was', 'just', 'fan', 'President', 'shot', 'Tom', 'quickly', 'grabs', 'camera', 'tourist', 'crowd', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'see', 'captured', 'pertinent', 'information', 'other', 'agent', 'tries', 'catch', 'shooter', 'who', 'think', 'was', 'different', 'window.Back', 'up', 'beginning', 'events', '.They', 'flip', 'back', 'forth', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'giving', 'events', 'slightly', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'leaving', 'cliffhanger', 'Finally', 'begin', 'show', 'how', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'come', 'together.Sort', 'of.The', 'movie', 'out', 'using', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'well', 'retelling', 'events', 'see', 'slightly', 'different', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'How', 'events', 'fit', 'together', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'end.But', 'end', 'where', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'apart', 'main', 'characters', 'play', 'part', 'climax', 'only', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'was', 'expecting', 'characters', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'solution', 'Instead', 'coincidence', 'ruled', 'day.I', 'found', 'repetitive', 'flashbacks', 'interesting', 'first', 'eventually', 'annoying', 'hour', 'stuff', 'already', 'know', 'just', 'giving', 'small', 'bit', 'new', 'information', 'time', 'when', 'get', 'pay', 'off', 'action', ""n't"", 'believable', 'was', 'glued', 'seat', 'climax', 'brief', 'aside', 'Part', 'background', 'color', 'movie', 'bunch', 'anti-America', 'protesters', 'fine', 'twice', 'panned', 'crowd', 'clearly', 'saw', 'sign', 'had', 'W', 'crossed', 'out', 'current', 'US', 'President', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'film', 'producers', 'just', 'used', 'footage', 'protest', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'were', 'trying', 'sneak', 'political', 'statement', 'ever', 'was', 'found', 'distracting.Distractions', 'flaws', 'aside', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'saw', 'thriller']",Vantage Point
1138884,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0012QCZ5O,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","""Vantage Point"" is not a boring way to spend ninety minutes.  It has an excellent cast featuring a couple of Academy Award winners, and it has special effects that harken back to the days when car chases really looked hazardous and explosions looked like they happened to buildings rather than in a computer.That being said, all the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is as well.  It just finished raining for about 15 minutes and the puddle outside my door is deeper than this movie.The central story surrounds an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, played by William Hurt, while he is attending an historic anti-terrorism summit in Spain.  The film's central gimmick is that the same twenty minute period is shown repeatedly from several different perspectives.  The filmmakers insult the intelligence of the audience by ""fast-rewinding"" each twenty minute segment before starting on the ""next perspective"", so you know you're going backward in time, you know...Each segment adds new information to what came before, and each segment extends what happened before by a few moments, until finally the ""rewinding"" stops and enough viewpoints have been introduced to allow a pretty exciting car chase with secret agents chasing bad guys and an ambulance holding the President being driven by more bad guys.The first segment stars Sigourney Weaver as a tv news director covering the summit while choreographing her cameramen and the anchor, played by Zoe Saldana, who wants to cover the anti-American protestors as much as the Presidential summit.  After the President is shot there are two more explosions, the second one laying waste to the entire plaza and apparently killing everyone except for the handful of people whose viewpoints we are following.The second segment follows secret service men Taylor and Barnes, played by Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid. Many are surprised to see Quaid's Barnes there - a year earlier he was shot in another attempt on the President, and this is his first time back in the saddle.Other segments follow American tourist Howard Lewis, played by Forest Whitaker, and the Spanish Mayor's bodyguard, played by Edgar Ramirez.  A final segment takes us behind the scenes with the President and his political advisors before rewinding one final time and letting the story play forward.The terrorists behind the attack are shown to be more cunning and apparently better equipped than the forces around the President, but they are also paper-thin caricatures and other than a few throwaway lines about how long the war on terrorism has been going on, motivations are also as shallow as that puddle I mentioned earlier.",3,Political Thriller with a Gimmick,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2679,"['Vantage', 'Point', 'not', 'boring', 'way', 'spend', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'excellent', 'cast', 'featuring', 'couple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'special', 'effects', 'harken', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'car', 'really', 'looked', 'hazardous', 'explosions', 'looked', 'happened', 'buildings', 'rather', 'computer.That', 'being', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'finished', 'raining', '15', 'minutes', 'puddle', 'door', 'deeper', 'movie.The', 'central', 'story', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'played', 'William', 'Hurt', 'attending', 'historic', 'anti-terrorism', 'summit', 'Spain', 'film', 'central', 'gimmick', 'same', 'twenty', 'minute', 'period', 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'several', 'different', 'perspectives', 'filmmakers', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'fast-rewinding', 'twenty', 'minute', 'segment', 'starting', 'next', 'perspective', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'backward', 'time', 'know', 'segment', 'new', 'information', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'segment', 'what', 'happened', 'few', 'moments', 'finally', 'rewinding', 'stops', 'enough', 'viewpoints', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'allow', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'car', 'chase', 'secret', 'agents', 'chasing', 'bad', 'guys', 'ambulance', 'holding', 'President', 'being', 'driven', 'more', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'first', 'segment', 'stars', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'tv', 'news', 'director', 'covering', 'summit', 'choreographing', 'cameramen', 'anchor', 'played', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'cover', 'anti-American', 'protestors', 'as', 'much', 'Presidential', 'summit', 'President', 'shot', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'explosions', 'second', 'one', 'laying', 'waste', 'entire', 'plaza', 'apparently', 'killing', 'everyone', 'handful', 'people', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'following.The', 'second', 'segment', 'secret', 'service', 'men', 'Taylor', 'Barnes', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Many', 'are', 'surprised', 'see', 'Quaid', 'Barnes', 'year', 'earlier', 'was', 'shot', 'attempt', 'President', 'first', 'time', 'back', 'saddle.Other', 'segments', 'follow', 'American', 'tourist', 'Howard', 'Lewis', 'played', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Spanish', 'Mayor', 'bodyguard', 'played', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'final', 'segment', 'scenes', 'President', 'political', 'advisors', 'rewinding', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'letting', 'story', 'play', 'forward.The', 'terrorists', 'attack', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'more', 'cunning', 'apparently', 'better', 'equipped', 'forces', 'President', 'are', 'also', 'paper-thin', 'caricatures', 'other', 'few', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'how', 'long', 'war', 'terrorism', 'been', 'going', 'motivations', 'are', 'also', 'as', 'shallow', 'puddle', 'mentioned', 'earlier']",Vantage Point
1138885,A17BUUBOU0598B,B0012QCZ5O,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[43, 49]","""Vantage Point"" is a good action drama that you can predict pretty well from the trailer.  It is based on a concept that has been done many times before, that of telling the same story from multiple points of view.  Fans of ""24"" will get a strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu24 - Season 1 (Slim - Pack).  Yet the core story is interesting.  The action sequences and great camera work make this a movie worth watching.  Good acting and a strong finish help to overcome some loose ends and production errors.The President of the United States (William Hurt), or POTUS as referred to by the secret service, is the target of a group of terrorists whose objectives are never revealed to us.  While overseas to attend an anti-terrorism summit in Spain, he is shot.  Or is he?Dennis Quaid and Mathew Fox (of ""Lost"" fameLost - The Complete First Season) play secret service agents there to protect the President.  After multiple attacks occur after the president is shot, they scramble to try to respond and find the shooter.  It is very difficult to tell which attacks are meant to kill and which are meant to divert attention away from the villains.Quaid takes advantage of Forest Whitaker's camcorder film and the media's tapes to piece together the story.  As each of the characters is swung into action, we get to see their individual struggles to cope with chaos and how their stories are interconnected.Perhaps in an homage to ""24,"" after each character's scene finishes it 'rewinds' to the beginning to give us the next character's 'vantage point.' This gets old fast.  After a while, these vantage points seem to disintegrate into one another and overlap more and more.  In fact, this is one story where the effect seems to have taken away from the story.The action sequences are very strong, and even though there's a lot of hand held camera work they get enough steady shots to make the chase scenes watchable.  Most notable is a car chase scene that is bound to draw comparisons to RoninRonin, The Bourne IdentityThe Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition), The Italian JobThe Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition)and other recent car chase movies.  Putting together a sequence like that is very difficult, and I can't wait for the DVD to see how they did it.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good car chase.The pacing of the movie is good and especially improves once we get to the last few vantage points.  The score is excellent and blends well with the action sequences.  We are purposely left without reasons why this group is after the president.There are some technical things that are off in the movie.  Anybody who has ever been to Spain will get that uneasy feeling.  Once you see the Mexican extras and hear them speak a very Central American Spanish it becomes clear they are in Mexico, not Spain.  They try to use a few Spanish actors, but it's not enough to feel like Spain.Some parts of the dialogue seem overly preachy.  Still, this movie does effectively portray how difficult security planning is in a world where government security tactics are public knowledge.  The story probably would have been more profound and meaningful with a traditional plot-line, which it turns into at the end anyway.This movie is worth watching and improves a lot towards the end.  You just have to get past several very annoying rewind sequences and plenty of early repetition.Enjoy!",3,"Vantage Point - Gets Better Towards the End, Worth Watching!",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,3402,"['Vantage', 'Point', 'good', 'action', 'drama', 'can', 'predict', 'pretty', 'well', 'trailer', 'based', 'concept', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'Fans', '24', 'will', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu24', 'Season', '1', 'Slim', 'Pack', 'core', 'story', 'interesting', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Good', 'acting', 'strong', 'finish', 'help', 'overcome', 'loose', 'ends', 'production', 'errors.The', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'William', 'Hurt', 'POTUS', 'referred', 'secret', 'service', 'target', 'group', 'terrorists', 'objectives', 'are', 'never', 'revealed', 'overseas', 'attend', 'anti-terrorism', 'summit', 'Spain', 'shot', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Mathew', 'Fox', 'Lost', 'fameLost', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'play', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'there', 'protect', 'President', 'multiple', 'attacks', 'occur', 'president', 'shot', 'scramble', 'try', 'respond', 'find', 'shooter', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'attacks', 'are', 'meant', 'kill', 'are', 'meant', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'villains.Quaid', 'advantage', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'camcorder', 'film', 'media', 'tapes', 'piece', 'together', 'story', 'characters', 'swung', 'action', 'get', 'see', 'individual', 'struggles', 'cope', 'chaos', 'how', 'stories', 'are', 'interconnected.Perhaps', 'homage', '24', 'character', 'scene', 'beginning', 'give', 'next', 'character', ""'vantage"", 'point', 'old', 'fast', 'while', 'vantage', 'points', 'seem', 'disintegrate', 'one', 'overlap', 'more', 'more', 'fact', 'one', 'story', 'where', 'effect', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'story.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'even', 'lot', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'work', 'get', 'enough', 'steady', 'shots', 'make', 'chase', 'watchable', 'Most', 'notable', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'bound', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'RoninRonin', 'Bourne', 'IdentityThe', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Widescreen', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Italian', 'JobThe', 'Italian', 'Job', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'other', 'recent', 'car', 'chase', 'movies', 'Putting', 'together', 'sequence', 'very', 'difficult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'What', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'car', 'chase.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'good', 'especially', 'once', 'get', 'last', 'few', 'vantage', 'points', 'score', 'excellent', 'well', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'purposely', 'left', 'reasons', 'why', 'group', 'president.There', 'are', 'technical', 'things', 'are', 'movie', 'Anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'Spain', 'will', 'get', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'Once', 'see', 'Mexican', 'extras', 'hear', 'speak', 'very', 'Central', 'American', 'Spanish', 'clear', 'are', 'Mexico', 'not', 'Spain', 'try', 'use', 'few', 'Spanish', 'actors', 'not', 'enough', 'feel', 'Spain.Some', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'overly', 'preachy', 'Still', 'movie', 'effectively', 'portray', 'how', 'difficult', 'security', 'planning', 'world', 'where', 'government', 'security', 'tactics', 'are', 'public', 'knowledge', 'story', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'profound', 'meaningful', 'traditional', 'plot-line', 'end', 'anyway.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'lot', 'end', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'past', 'several', 'very', 'annoying', 'rewind', 'sequences', 'plenty', 'early', 'repetition.Enjoy']",Vantage Point
1138886,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0012QCZ5O,Mark Turner,"[9, 10]","VANTAGE POINT was a movie whose preview seemed to play nearly every time I went to the theater. So much so that by the time the movie was released I was tired of seeing it. A major mistake on my point as this was one of the most thrilling movies I've seen in years.The film revolves around a visit by the US President (William Hurt) to a conference on terrorism in Spain. Several countries have agreed to back his proposal in and effort to stop the killing. As the President walks to the podium in an open air square where the conference is taking place, he is shot by an assassin's bullet. This starts the film.But there is more to it than that. As the title states, the film is offered from various vantage points of the same scene. The opening scene is offered via a news network's truck as it watches the carnage that happens when the President is not only shot but a bomb blows up in the public square.Through them we are introduced to Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and lead Agent Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox). These are the agents in charge of protecting the President, a job Barnes knows well as less than a year earlier he took a bullet while protecting him. On edge and looking for signs of trouble, Barnes' sharp eye and instincts kick in just before the shot is fired.But Barnes' perception is not the last we are offered. We are also given the viewpoint of Enrigue (Eduardo Noriega), a policeman who becomes suspect by the Secret Service when he rushes the podium to protect the President. Another view is offered through the eyes of vacationer Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) who is filming all he sees with his new camcorder. An important view is that of the President himself when we learn it was not him but his double who took the bullet! The last view offered is that of the terrorists whose job was to kill the President...or was it?Each section takes a 23 minute time period and condenses it to offer the varying viewpoints of each character. And with each differing viewpoint we as viewers ourselves are offered more clues as to just who is behind the assassination attempt. Until the last view offered I had no firm idea.Movies have been called white knuckle rides but this movie fulfills that line to a T. The breakneck pace of the film, while showing us the same basic scene over and over, holds you in its grip not just for the carnage that ensues but because of the action that follows. Leads are discovered and agents set in motion as they try to capture the person responsible.Many people have claimed that THE FRENCH CONNECTION or BULLIT or lately the Bourne films have offered the greatest car chases of all times. I think that title can now be taken by the stunt drivers in this film. Moving at breakneck speed through tiny streets that are little more than alleys filled with pedestrians and cars takes your breath away.All performances are top of the line.

Starring Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox as Secret Service agents, Sigourney Weaver as a cable news director, and Forrest Witaker as a tourist with a video camera, Vantage Point gives you a look at the same fifteen minutes of an event from multiple, you guessed it, vantage points.The President of the United States has gathered with many of the world's leaders in Spain to initiate a new task force to battle terrorism. As he steps up to the podium, with arms outstretched, a sniper shoots him. The place goes into chaos with people running around, screaming; and then the bomb goes off.Dennis Quaid is the seasoned agent who had taken a bullet for the President earlier in his term and is just now returning to active duty because his partner (Fox) believes in him. He does a great job with that sour face of his. I think in almost every movie he's in, he wears that scowl. That could be because his smile is very goofy.Matthew Fox comes across as your typical American hero. I haven't seen Speed Racer or We Are Marshall, but this man will have a future in films.Sigourney Weaver starts the movie off, but you really don't see much of her. I guess that's alright. We see her point of view first and then that's it.There are twists as you would expect in this film. It is a good action-thriller. The run time is only one hour and thirty minutes so it's a very quick movie.I think the point of the movie, outside of being a good action film, is to show that there are always reasons or back stories.

1138892,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,B0012QCZ5O,Michael K. Smith,"[0, 0]","""What is truth?"" is the eternal question. The answer in this superior thriller is that truth depends on your vantage point, your position and role in events, who you know and what you witness. Things appear very different for the President of the United States than they do even for a lead Secret Service agent, much less for an American tourist with a movie camera, or for a little girl accompanying her mother. The key story -- which occupies only fifteen minutes of time but is repeated over and over -- concerns the attempted kidnapping of the President, who is in Spain for an anti-terrorism summit. When he's introduced in the Plaza Mayor, he's nailed by a sniper. And while the crowd is screaming and running in all directions, a bomb, tossed under the speaker's stand, detonates and turns the Plaza into a war zone. William Hurt, playing both the President and his double, is, . . . well, presidential. Dennis Quaid has aged craggily and makes a quite believable member of the security detail. Eduardo Noriega, not well known in the U.S., is good as a dedicated member of the Spanish national police, and Edgar Ramirez is scary as the head of the terrorist crew. Forest Whitaker is Howard Lewis, whose camera in the crowd picks up key information, and who joins the chase for no discernible reason than that it's happening. This marvelous film is actually much more innovative in its structure than the professional reviewers have given it credit for. They keep comparing it to Rashomon, but that's not really valid. Kurosawa gave us multiple versions of the same events and asked us to choose among them. Here we start with a lot of unanswered questions and misunderstandings on the part of its multiple-viewpoint characters, but we gradually home in on the true course of the depicted events. Barry Levy's screenplay is very good and as a longtime student of film-writing, I'm going to have to find a copy.",4,A terrific and unusual action film -- occasional plot holes notwithstanding,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1916,"['What', 'truth', 'eternal', 'question', 'answer', 'superior', 'thriller', 'truth', 'vantage', 'point', 'position', 'role', 'events', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'witness', 'Things', 'appear', 'very', 'different', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'do', 'even', 'lead', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'much', 'less', 'American', 'tourist', 'movie', 'camera', 'little', 'girl', 'accompanying', 'mother', 'key', 'story', 'only', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'time', 'repeated', 'over', 'attempted', 'kidnapping', 'President', 'who', 'Spain', 'anti-terrorism', 'summit', 'When', 'introduced', 'Plaza', 'Mayor', 'nailed', 'sniper', 'crowd', 'screaming', 'running', 'directions', 'bomb', 'tossed', 'speaker', 'stand', 'detonates', 'Plaza', 'war', 'zone', 'William', 'Hurt', 'playing', 'President', 'double', 'well', 'presidential', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'aged', 'craggily', 'quite', 'believable', 'member', 'security', 'detail', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'U.S.', 'good', 'dedicated', 'member', 'Spanish', 'national', 'police', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'scary', 'head', 'terrorist', 'crew', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Howard', 'Lewis', 'camera', 'crowd', 'up', 'key', 'information', 'who', 'chase', 'discernible', 'reason', 'happening', 'marvelous', 'film', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'innovative', 'structure', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'credit', 'keep', 'comparing', 'Rashomon', 'not', 'really', 'valid', 'Kurosawa', 'gave', 'multiple', 'versions', 'same', 'events', 'asked', 'choose', 'Here', 'start', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'misunderstandings', 'part', 'multiple-viewpoint', 'characters', 'gradually', 'home', 'true', 'course', 'depicted', 'events', 'Barry', 'Levy', 'screenplay', 'very', 'good', 'longtime', 'student', 'film-writing', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'find', 'copy']",Vantage Point

At the culmination of a historic peace summit in Salamanca, Spain, an attempt is made on the life of the President of the United States.

Over the course of the film, the hour is rewinded and replayed through the eyes of each character until, finally, the audience has the whole story.This was a great action thriller. I loved the style and premise of the movie, and I really loved the fact that, even though the movie was largely about action, all the performers were really strong in their roles.The cast was great, with heavy-hitters even in small roles. Matthew Fox plays Agent Taylor, who serves on the President's Secret Service detail. Dennis Quaid plays Agent Thomas Barnes, who's recently returned to the detail after taking a bullet for the President the previous year. William Hurt plays the Prez, and Sigourney Weaver has a great (but small) part as Rex, a television journalist on-site to cover the summit. Forest Whitaker turns in a touching performance as Howard, an American with a troubled marriage in town to observe the festivities. There are also several foreign actors in the film that you may not recognize, but who deliver the goods on screen just as well as their famous co-stars - Edgar Ramirez, Ayelet Zurer, Eduardo Noriega, and Said Taghmaqui.I won't spoil how everything shakes out, but the ending had me on the very edge of my seat.

Quickly I knew that some people were not who they claimed to be, but I was still surprised over and over again. The plot is quite complicated actually. You're good if you watch it only once and walk away understanding the motives of each character and his or her role in the entire event. I myself watched it once and then watched the second half over again because it was about half-way through that things got hairy. To me, though, this only adds to the film. I consider it even better if I need to watch a movie more than once to fully understand it (consider Memento). Please note this movie is not nearly on the level of the complexity of Memento, though.I gave the movie 4 stars because I thought the plot was a bit spotty, and I feel in the end that it has holes in it. Maybe I'm just not smart enough. Could be. But...you also get the typical Hollywood deaths - here one person dies conveniently instantly while another lives to speak a few important lines. Some people are killed with just a knife to the back, and sometimes one hit is all it takes to bring down a guy. You get the classic rag-over-the-mouth-guy-passes-out capture and take down. Silly. So the deaths could have been more realistic. Still, it is Hollywood.Anyway, bottom line: you have to see this movie.

He is shot and the historic square where he was standing is subjected to a huge bomb blast as well.I feel okay telling you this, because that's all revealed in the first few minutes of the movie. We see it all play out through the eyes of the TV journalists who are covering the event.  Because we haven't seen all the details of the attack before, we can enjoy a little thrill of the unexpected and the blood certainly gets racing during these opening scenes.  Then, the film goes back about 20 minutes to show the same events from the point of view of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), just returning to active duty a year after taking a bullet for the President.  Then it goes back AGAIN and shows everything from various other points of view.  Each retelling has slightly different information, of course, and each goes a little past the other, so that we see a little more of the story unfold.Frankly, though, this device gets a little tiresome (and evoked a few sniggers from the audience as we see it going back YET AGAIN to the beginning).  It seems to want to lend some sort of importance to the film, but truly, the same story could have been told in a more traditional manner and perhaps been even more exciting.  The first time we see the president take a bullet, it's pretty unnerving. The fifth time we see it...ho hum.Eventually, the film moves forward towards a resolution, mostly involving Quaid discovering a major character is not who he/she appears and then chasing that person throughout the old Spanish city for a really long time in a really small car.  (Good thing it doesn't have airbags or he would have been out of the chase pretty early on!).The chase is reminiscent of the one in BOURNE IDENTITY and the location in Salamanca looks a lot like many of the locales in BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  The whole film feels derivative.  Other than its time-hopping gimic...there isn't much plot.  In fact, when it's all over, I realised that the entire narrative probably covered less than 40 minutes of time.  Also, the conclusion relies too much on the coincidence of EVERYONE arriving at the same location at the same time.There's a visceral, jumpy quality to much of the action, and there's no doubt the car chase is done well.  It has moments of excitement.  But there's is simply too little meat on the bones of this film for it have any hope of rising above the mediocre.Quaid, William Hurt (as the President), Matthew Fox as Quaid's co-hort and other well known character actors are all quite okay.  Forest Whitaker, as a tourist with a knack for videotaping the exact right things, is lost in a poorly written, thankless role...and he does little to make it more tolerable.  Sigourney Weaver, as the TV producer, spends the whole movie in the remote broadcast truck, and you quickly realise that there is absolutely no reason for an actor of her stature to be in this film.  She is given nothing interesting to do...but I assume got a decent paycheck for perhaps a weeks worth of work.The movie is a 90 minute diversion, and certainly it is technically skillful.

To explore this theme, the movie employs the old ""Rashomon"" technique of telling the same story from the viewpoint of a half dozen or so characters present at the scene.  The incident in this case is the attempted assassination of the President of the United States at an anti-terrorism summit being held in Salamanca, Spain, an event at which two massive bombs are also detonated.  In Barry Levy`s screenplay, each angle of the story functions much like an individual piece in a giant jigsaw puzzle, the full picture of which comes fully clear only after each element has been successfully fitted and secured in its proper place.""Vantage Point"" features a large cast of well-known actors, including William Hurt as the President; Dennis Quaid and Michael Fox as secret service agents; Sigourney Weaver as a TV news producer; Forest Whitaker as an American tourist; Zoe Saldana as a news reporter; and Eduardo Noriega, Edgar Ramirez and Ayelet Zurer as Spanish terrorists (the Spaniards definitely get the short end of the stick in this movie).Despite the deliberately fragmented nature of the narrative, the main focus of the film falls on Quaid's character, an agent who less than a year earlier took a bullet for the President and who is now returning to his job an obviously shaken and high strung man.Directed by Pete Travis, ""Vantage Point"" is a high octane political thriller that gets the job done without ever distinguishing itself overmuch.  By constantly returning to the same event (the movie sometimes feels like a somber remake of ""Groundhog Day"") and relating the story through so many eyewitnesses, the film sacrifices some of its character development for sheer narrative pyrotechnics.  Still, the storytelling is occasionally ingenious and Travis keeps the action percolating along at a fast enough clip to keep us from noting the sometimes farfetched and overwrought nature of much of what the movie is showing us (it also points up just how many nefarious things one can presumably do with an iphone these days).  There`s even a humdinger of a car chase through the beautiful streets of Salamanca that is sure to get the adrenalin pumping, even if the mind is left reeling by its overall implausibility.""Vantage Point"" may have you rolling your eyes from time to time in confusion and disbelief, especially towards the end of the movie, but it is at least guaranteed to keep you entertained for the ninety or so minutes it takes to tell its story.",3,"""Rashomon"" crossed with ""Groundhog Day""",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,2593,"['***1/2As', 'title', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'unique', 'perspective', 'events', 'witness', 'explore', 'theme', 'movie', 'old', 'Rashomon', 'technique', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'viewpoint', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'characters', 'present', 'scene', 'incident', 'case', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'anti-terrorism', 'summit', 'being', 'held', 'Salamanca', 'Spain', 'event', 'two', 'massive', 'bombs', 'are', 'also', 'detonated', 'Barry', 'Levy', 's', 'screenplay', 'angle', 'story', 'functions', 'much', 'individual', 'piece', 'giant', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'full', 'picture', 'fully', 'clear', 'only', 'element', 'been', 'successfully', 'fitted', 'secured', 'proper', 'place', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'large', 'cast', 'well-known', 'actors', 'including', 'William', 'Hurt', 'President', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Michael', 'Fox', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'TV', 'news', 'producer', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'American', 'tourist', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'news', 'reporter', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'Ayelet', 'Zurer', 'Spanish', 'terrorists', 'Spaniards', 'definitely', 'get', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'fragmented', 'nature', 'narrative', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'Quaid', 'character', 'agent', 'who', 'less', 'year', 'earlier', 'took', 'bullet', 'President', 'who', 'now', 'returning', 'job', 'obviously', 'shaken', 'high', 'strung', 'man.Directed', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'high', 'octane', 'political', 'thriller', 'job', 'done', 'ever', 'distinguishing', 'overmuch', 'constantly', 'returning', 'same', 'event', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'somber', 'remake', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'relating', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'eyewitnesses', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'sheer', 'narrative', 'pyrotechnics', 'Still', 'storytelling', 'occasionally', 'ingenious', 'Travis', 'action', 'percolating', 'along', 'fast', 'enough', 'clip', 'keep', 'noting', 'sometimes', 'farfetched', 'overwrought', 'nature', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'showing', 'also', 'up', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'nefarious', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'presumably', 'do', 'iphone', 'days', 's', 'even', 'humdinger', 'car', 'chase', 'beautiful', 'streets', 'Salamanca', 'sure', 'get', 'adrenalin', 'pumping', 'even', 'mind', 'left', 'reeling', 'overall', 'implausibility', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'may', 'have', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'time', 'time', 'confusion', 'disbelief', 'especially', 'end', 'movie', 'least', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'entertained', 'ninety', 'so', 'minutes', 'tell', 'story']",Vantage Point

On the contrary, the misdirection made Vantage Point seem like it would be another one of the many government conspiracy theory movies. But it's not. And I think that the marketing of this movie contributed to its lackluster box office performance.Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are great.

1138921,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B0012QCZ5O,SteakSalad101,"[2, 2]","Vantage Point was the film I chose to see this weekend at my local theater and I went in with high hopes. The storyline, which is a part-interlocking , part-flashback film (which, for the record, are my two favourite film elements combined into one!) is simple, yet complex to uncover. The film opens at a UN gathering of world leaders in Spain, with a big crowd, in an even bigger square. Suddenly the president of the United States is shot twice by an unseen assassin. The next thing you know, two bombs go off, one of them destroying the square.The film is made up of that story told five times--each from a different point of view from a different person who was there. First, we've got agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who is back on assignment after taking a bullet for the president six months prior. He's paranoid, and picks up on any slight signal that could mean an assassination threat. Next, there's a shady looking cop who commits a strange act at the scene--is he corrupt? You decide. Third, we've got the American tourist (Forest Whitaker) who loves videotaping things. Fourth, we have the president himself, and fifth--we see the assassination unfold before our eyes. In addition to these four main characters, there are four others who are involved in the scenes, and combined, makes for a total of eight people searching for the truth--or who are somehow involved in it.Each ""vantage point"" (hence the film's righteous name) offers more and more clues as to which of these people were involved in the assassination. Director Pete Travis delivers a bang-up job in making the plot line completely and utterly unpredictable. Even most people who can guess plot twists coming at any speed will be left baffled and thinking hard. My favourite aspect of the film was that it was entirely the same thing on repeat--yet different every time. There were some stupid idiots in my theater that were booing every time the scene got restarted, and that's where I think a lot of people will dislike this film, because it is undoubtedly repetitive. However, I feel the redundancy of the film adds to its original essence and its tension. The tension in the film is done very well and the first quarter of the film will have you holding on to your seat. Although there's a more than action packed climax, people who just want to see stuff blown up and people shot and car chases will be left disappointed throughout the movie. Don't worry--even throughout the redundancy there's plenty of that good stuff. My other favourite aspect of the film was its acting--Dennis Quaid was excellent and Forest Whitaker blew me away like he always does, in a role perfectly cast for him. Sigourney Weaver's brief cameos were done very well and everyone in the cast does a great job.All that being said, Vantage Point is definitely not without its flaws. Some of the characters aren't introduced right and the execution in many scenes is done very sloppily. The climax (although ironically long) is extremely rushed and, in my opinion, was done rather poorly. Unfortunately I can't elaborate without giving away major spoilers, but it is a fun ending to watch nevertheless, and you are able to forgive the sloppy editing. The thing that made me want to cry was the horribly clich&eacute;d conclusion that shouldn't have happened. In my opinion...they should've revised the screenplay. I hope there's an alternate ending on the DVD.So, if you're looking for a decent thriller or a movie to check out, you might just want to see Vantage Point. The classic assassination thriller, a splash of originality, garnished with great acting and an unneeded sloppy ending turns out to be one bittersweet cocktail.

1138923,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0012QCZ5O,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","An attempt  is made on the life of the American President during a major international summit in Spain, and the Secret Service agents rush to try and save the President, while the well-organized attackers constantly seem one step ahead.  Not a groundbreaking plot, but the way it's executed is certainly innovative,especially for the type of movie.  As alluded to by the title, the story is told several different times from several different angles - each time entirely from the perspective of a different character.  The different angles cross and intersect, same time covering the same incidents from a different viewpoint and other times uncovering new territory and events.  I've seen this kind of thing done before in Asian movies likeJu-On 2but I'm not aware of it having been previously applied to a straight-up, gunfights-and-car-chases style action thriller.  As it turns out, the technique molds itself to this kind of material excellently, and makes what probably would have been a good movie anyway much better.  Extreme attention is paid to detail, and the seperate tellings of the same story mesh perfectly by movie's end.  We see events unfold from the eyes of the agents, the President, the terrorists, news reporters on the scene, and everyday civilians, with a talented cast filling out their roles to great effect.  At the end, not everything about motivation and the like is explained; it feels like a sequel may have been planned, but with this kind of movie you usually have to make several fortunes to get a sequel nowadays, and while Vantage Point did well at the box office and on DVD, I'm not sure it was as much as they were hoping for.  Too bad; a follow-up could have been great.  I envision a part-sequel, part-prequel told several different times from several different viewpoints, but this time spanning months or even years instead of a few hours.  Oh well, maybe we'll get a follow-up and maybe not; either way Vantage Point itself is a great action movie and a cerebral, engaging thriller.",4,"A Simple But Effective Plot, With Great Innovation On How It's Executed",1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,2025,"['attempt', 'made', 'life', 'American', 'President', 'major', 'international', 'summit', 'Spain', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'rush', 'try', 'save', 'President', 'well-organized', 'attackers', 'constantly', 'seem', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Not', 'groundbreaking', 'plot', 'way', 'executed', 'certainly', 'innovative', 'especially', 'type', 'movie', 'alluded', 'title', 'story', 'told', 'several', 'different', 'times', 'several', 'different', 'angles', 'time', 'entirely', 'perspective', 'different', 'character', 'different', 'angles', 'cross', 'intersect', 'same', 'time', 'covering', 'same', 'incidents', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'other', 'times', 'uncovering', 'new', 'territory', 'events', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'thing', 'done', 'Asian', 'movies', 'likeJu-On', '2but', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'having', 'been', 'previously', 'applied', 'straight-up', 'gunfights-and-car-chases', 'style', 'action', 'thriller', 'out', 'technique', 'kind', 'material', 'excellently', 'what', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'anyway', 'much', 'better', 'Extreme', 'attention', 'paid', 'detail', 'seperate', 'tellings', 'same', 'story', 'mesh', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'end', 'see', 'events', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'agents', 'President', 'terrorists', 'news', 'reporters', 'scene', 'everyday', 'civilians', 'talented', 'cast', 'filling', 'out', 'roles', 'great', 'effect', 'end', 'not', 'everything', 'motivation', 'like', 'explained', 'sequel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'planned', 'kind', 'movie', 'usually', 'have', 'make', 'several', 'fortunes', 'get', 'sequel', 'nowadays', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'were', 'hoping', 'Too', 'bad', 'follow-up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'envision', 'part-sequel', 'part-prequel', 'told', 'several', 'different', 'times', 'several', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'time', 'spanning', 'months', 'even', 'years', 'instead', 'few', 'hours', 'Oh', 'well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'follow-up', 'maybe', 'not', 'way', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'cerebral', 'engaging', 'thriller']",Vantage Point

Unfortunately I did just that and when I came back I found the repeated story telling (from a different vantage point) too tiresome. Unlike the Denzel Washington starrer ""Courage Under Fire"" which also used the Rashomon effect, Vantage Point is in more agreement with the Rashomon effect because the incidents from each vantage point adhere to the truth than falsehood that the characters of the former movie confess. The screenplay can get boring due to the repeated story telling but towards the end all is compensated with the twist which was worth the some-what tiresome wait. Crowd participation and control in the outdoor scenes were good too. Filming mostly outdoors is challenging but it is done well in Vantage Point.Vantage Point is a good movie for Dennis Quaid. His role reminds one of Clint Eastwood who played a similar role in ""In the line of Fire"".I also wondered why some senior actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Forest Whitaker to some extent, had very small roles to play.There is one very good car chase.

Honestly none of the so called Vantage Points are that convincing or shocking.  It is fairly easy from the beginning to pick out who the terrorists are.

Isn't there some point where the camera man must put the camera down and help out?

1138928,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0012QCZ5O,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 11]","President Ashton (William Hurt) is scheduled to make an appearance in Spain, with a number of other world leaders, to show their support of a recent Anti-Terrorism bill they have all worked on. The Secret Service is out in force to protect POTUS (The President of the United States) from the massive crowds that have assembled. One of those agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) is back on the job after a lengthy recovery after taking a bullet for the President a year ago. As this is his first assignment back, he is, naturally, a little shell shocked. His partner, Taylor (Matthew Fox) is confident the veteran can handle the action. An American tourist, Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) stumbles upon the ceremony, and, eager to share the memories with the folks at home, videotapes everything. A Spanish Policeman, Javier (Edgar Ramirez) tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, but she is cold to him, and only wants the bag she asked him to bring. Dejected, he begins to put two and two together and rushes to the stage as... The GNN is also on hand, to cover the press conference and the harried director, Rex (Sigourney Weaver) is shocked when her cameras capture the assassination of the President. But Barnes begins to suspect there is more going on and is determined to find out the truth.""Vantage Point"", the new film directed by Pete Travis (who comes from British Television) and written by Barry Levy, uses an interesting narrative device to frame an overworked story. But they don't seem to fully embrace the idea and the results are a mixed bag.""Vantage"" sets up its narrative device very quickly, and efficiently, giving us a jam packed opening segment. Basically, Rex and her team are covering the President's speech. As his arrival is imminent, Rex is trying to coordinate all of the different cameras, her liberal reporter (Zoe Saldana) and the network in New York. As soon as the President arrives, Rex is confident she has worked out the kinks, but she is shocked, as is everyone else, when the President is captured on camera receiving two bullets. Shortly thereafter, Barnes bursts into her control room and wants to see video. When he scans through the video, something catches his eye. Then, the film literally rewinds, showing us a few key images, presumably clues to what is going on, and a clock shows us we have rewound the last twenty minutes to just before Noon. Now, we see the same events, but through Barnes' eyes, seeing the different things he sees, learning different information.As the story unfolds again, we move a little further in the narrative before the film rewinds and we are back to Noon. This time, we are watching the same events unfold through President Ashton's eyes. Then, we rewind again and watch the events through Javier's eyes. This happens a number of times, each story showing us slightly different information, ending slightly later, giving us a larger view of the same picture. As we watch the events unfold again and again, we learn more and more and realize maybe Barnes is right.The audience at the screening I attended seemed to get a little annoyed by the rewinding narrative. Ever heard of Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" folks? ""Vantage Point"" isn't as good as Kurosawa's masterpiece, but it is an interesting technique to use in this day and age. It also keeps the film moving at a fast clip. As each of these segments runs about fifteen minutes, all of the various story elements within are presented at hyper speed, to make sure we always arrive at the same point. This isn't to say they feel forced, they just move, and this makes the film seem fast paced. So, for these reasons, I appreciated the narrative device.But towards the end of the film, when Barnes is chasing the bad people through the streets of Salamanca, it occurred to me that we missed a couple of vantage points. These segments allow each of the characters to become established in our eyes, as the segments present their point of view of the proceedings. The characters who are given full segments are more interesting and viable, even if they are a bit formulaic. One segment is devoted to three or four people, all of whom are behind the plot, only showing us their actions in the plot. This is problematic because we never learn, beyond some overused jingoistic slogans, why these people are interested in assassinating our President.There is a `big surprise' towards the end of the film which is more or less telegraphed very early on. Anyone who has seen more than a few thrillers or similar suspense films will likely be able to figure this out much earlier than the filmmakers want you to. This is a bit of a let down because when they reveal this big surprise, you have already figured it out and it seems more commonplace than anything else.Because each of the stars has basically one segment to call their own, they have to develop their character at a rapid pace. This shortened focus on their individual characters helps to make them seem more interesting than they are; many of them are little more than clich&eacute;s, but since we only spend ten to fifteen minutes focusing on them, these problems aren't as apparent. Naturally, as these characters interact, they make `guest appearances' in each of the stories, and the filmmakers have smartly held back key moments, for instance, we don't see what Barnes sees in the videotape until much later in the film, of some of these characters until the attention shifts to their character or until the film is about the come to a close, building the suspense nicely.Quaid, one of the most underrated actors working today, fares well. His back story is established during the first segment, concentrating on the GNN coverage of the event. Rex catches a glimpse of him in one of the cameras and commands one of her editors to pull up the story, rehashing Barnes previous attempts at thwarting an assassin's bullet. So, when the attention shifts to Barnes, all we need to see is his shaky hand to know he is feeling a little trepidation about his return to duty. Because he is nervous, he naturally sees assassins every where.William Hurt also does a very good job as President Ashton. Ashton seems more self-aware, more conscious of his image and his actions on the rest of the world than we are perhaps used to. This is why he is so determined to see this agreement he has forged, an agreement to fight terrorism, become a reality. When he is presented with a plan to retaliate against the people suspected of the attack, he downplays the need to act immediately, aware that this is what they want and also aware of the consequences of attacking a friendly country. As he enters the ceremony, among signs labeling him a murderer and a terrorist, he also seems to disregard these as the necessary evils of his job.Sigourney Weaver's role as Rex, the director of the news network feed, is a bit short, and reactionary. She has a brief fight with her reporter (Saldana) and then simply reacts to the rest of the events. The person I saw this film with wondered if part of her role had been edited, left on the cutting room floor, because it seems unnaturally abrupt.Forest Whitaker plays the American tourist, Howard Lewis, traveling through Europe for the first time. We learn he and his wife are taking a break, to clear their heads, so Howard decides to travel and assiduously videotape everything he sees. Howard isn't a bad character, he is interesting, but his purpose is just too treacly to do the film any good. A Spanish girl, walking with her mom, accidently bumps into Howard, dropping her ice cream. Howard is apologetic, he has kids of his own, kids he misses dearly, and offers to buy her a replacement cone. Her mother declines. No, I'm not kidding, this is actually what happens to his character. Later, they are brought together in a moment that is just too farfetched to believe.Matthew Fox is good, but he seems designed to give Barnes the requisite encouragement he needs to get past his demons. As such, his character isn't exactly well-formed.""Vantage Point"" has problems, but it also has some benefits. It benefits from a fast-pace, interesting narrative device and some good work by well-respected character actors. These benefits almost outweigh the problems in the film.

But it's not even close. For starters, the characters may as well be made of cardboard. if you haven't figured out the bulk of ""Vantage Point"" within the first 30 minutes or better, you haven't watched enough political thrillers lately. Even with the predictability aside, there are bits here that are all but unfathomable.For instance, the American Tourist, as played by Forrest Whittaker. His camocrder captures the assassination/terrorist attack, but he's a bit of a - to be kind - portly guy. Before you know it, he's racing down the street, videoing with the product placement - sorry, the Sony - minicam while keeping up with two secret service agents who are chasing a very in-shape potential suspect. The man he's supposed to be would have been out of breath after a couple blocks, but not this guy. He's the energizer bunny with a videotape.The terrorists are willing to blast away any 'loose ends,' suicide bomb a hotel, blow up an entire crowd, but suddenly get concerned over a little girl? Huh? Oh yes, and these bloodthirsty, multicultural warriors (after all, the terrorists can't possibly be racially profiled) who kidnap a high ranking government official do so and race off WITHOUT RESTRAINING THE HOSTAGE. So guess what said captive manages to do soon after? And no, the answer isn't negotiate a peaceable settlement.Then there's the car chase. It's so impossibly choreographed as to be laughable. Yet Secret Service Agents Matthew Fox and Dennis Quiad manage to duck and weave their way through itty bitty streets and one-ways in reverse that you start wondering if Fox was trying to outmaneuver the rapid decline of his acting career. Add one ""America isn't like THAT"" Presidential sermon, a sappy resolution for Forrest, and the fact that the terrorists seem to have no agenda (how PC is that?), ""Vantage Point"" becomes a movie that wastes its talent (poor Sigourney Weaver as a b---chy producer in particular) that whatever POV it thought it had becomes more of a vanishing point.",2,Don't Retreat.

1138935,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B0012QCZ5O,Tristan,"[3, 3]","As the Bourne series raises the bar for action films, and audiences balk at two-plus hour runtimes, the filmmakers of Vantage Point seem like they are trying to bring a fresh, new, unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.The new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.Because of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot. It starts with a TV network covering a large gathering of leaders from all over the world (including the President of the United States) who have come together to form an alliance against the war on terror. At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.In the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of ""again?!"" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new  in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is ""out of ideas"" they get angry when it tries something ""different"" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.I felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system. I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.",4,The all-seeing eye,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,2405,"['Bourne', 'series', 'bar', 'action', 'films', 'audiences', 'balk', 'two-plus', 'hour', 'runtimes', 'filmmakers', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'seem', 'are', 'trying', 'bring', 'fresh', 'new', 'unconventional', 'take', 'action/thriller', 'genre', 'may', 'annoy', 'people', 'felt', 'new', 'take', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'taut', 'terrorist', 'thriller.The', 'new', 'take', 'approach', 'jumping', 'right', 'moment', 'everything', 'already', 'planned', 'out', 'people', 'weapons', 'place', 'etc', 'action', 'then', 'telling', 'eight', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'where', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'mildly', 'irritated', 'see', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'everything', 'suddenly', 'rewound', 'shown', 'next', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'done', 'six', 'times', 'converge', 'thrilling', 'finale', 'filled', 'one', 'massive', 'adrenaline-fuelled', 'car/chase', 'sequence.Because', 'complex', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'brief', 'very', 'brief', 'actually', 'plot', 'TV', 'network', 'covering', 'large', 'gathering', 'leaders', 'world', 'including', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'alliance', 'war', 'terror', 'beginning', 'meeting', 'US', 'president', 'assassinated', 'stage', 'replaying', 'assassination', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'editing', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'film', 'points', 'views', 'so', 'sophisticatedly', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'being', 'engrossed', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Mathew', 'Fox', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'simply', 'everything.In', 'theater', 'was', 'watching', 'people', 'called', 'out', 'annoyance', 'again', 'fifth', 'rewind', 'find', 'amusing', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'simply', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'sequel-ridden', 'times', 'probably', 'same', 'people', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'ideas', 'get', 'angry', 'when', 'something', 'different', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'spend', 'money', 'Spider-man', '8.I', 'felt', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'was', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'yes', 'had', 'share', 'implausible', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'minor', 'new', 'technique', 'feel', 'have', 'all-seeing', 'surveillance', 'system', 'kind', 'felt', 'was', 'putting', 'puzzle', 'together', 'piece', 'piece', 'see', 'new', 'point', 'view', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'again']",Vantage Point

You remember Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or probably you have seen some of Tarantino's films that employ the device quite effectively or Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing."" But I'm afraid in ""Vantage Point"" things went too far because it includes as many as eight characters' perspectives, or stories, to tell.You think it's repetitious? It is, but be patient as I explain it later. Anyway, the story of ""Vantage Point"" centers on the assassination of President of the United States (William Hurt) visiting Spain for international anti-terrorism conference. The cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver.After you witness the assassination scene from one character's viewpoint (from American traveler, secret agent, and so on), the camera suddenly freezes and starts to rewind, going back in time to the point where the film just began. Frankly this is s bit annoying to most viewers (including me), so every time the film starts rewinding, you may hear someone behind you groan in theater. Well, I think I did groan once or more.Each new take of the story shows the events from another perspective, but few of them really surprise us, not knowing how to illuminate the incidents in a truly refreshing fashion. The film only slowly adds new keys to the story - hidden identities and motives, etc. - but these truths are not particular interesting, and if you are fans of action films, I believe you can predict most of the twists and turns of the convoluting plot.Fortunately the latter half of the film gets faster and better with car chases and actions that become more and more hectic as the film goes on.

It's a thriller along the lines of Crash, but more disjointed, and not nearly as satisfying. Dennis Quaid plays a Secret Service agent responsible for helping to protect the President during a War on Terror summit in Salamanca, Spain. But things go wrong: the President is shot, a nearby hotel is bombed, and finally the podium area of the summit is bombed. By replaying the final 25 minutes leading up to these events, numerous times, the filmmakers piece together the various people involved from different vantage points. It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes. Only Forest Whitaker's performance raises this film above the average - that and a very good chase scene with Quaid.

1138944,AP3B615GM191G,B0012QCZ5O,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","The ""hook"" of Vantage Point is that when the President of the United States is shot in a crowded town square, many people witness the event. This film explores those multiple ""vantage points"", adding a new layer to the plot with each story. The film really works on two different levels:First, it contains enough twists and turns to really engage the mind into generating theories as to what is actually happening. Seemingly with every vantage point seen, the one before it is called into question. Thus, this leads to many ""whoa"" moments.Second, the acting is terrific. Matthew Fox, Dennis Quaid, William Hurt, and Forrest Whitaker (among others) all fit into their roles with ease, and each story is compelling enough to make you actually care about what will happen to each person. Plus, without trying to give too much away, the film also messes with audience's perceptions of actors from previous roles (cryptic, yes, but you'll get it once you watch).The only reason I do not give this film 5 stars is that the ending degenerates into nothing more than a Jason Bourne-style car chase scene, nothing like the provocative storytelling mode throughout most of the film.Overall, this is a great concept-film that showcases an entirely new type of storytelling. If you are a fan of action movies and love your ""no way!"" moments, you will enjoy this film immensely.",4,A Great New Concept,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,1365,"['hook', 'Vantage', 'Point', 'when', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'shot', 'crowded', 'town', 'square', 'many', 'people', 'witness', 'event', 'film', 'multiple', 'vantage', 'points', 'adding', 'new', 'layer', 'plot', 'story', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'different', 'levels', 'First', 'enough', 'twists', 'really', 'engage', 'mind', 'generating', 'theories', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'Seemingly', 'vantage', 'point', 'seen', 'one', 'called', 'question', 'Thus', 'many', 'whoa', 'moments.Second', 'acting', 'terrific', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'others', 'fit', 'roles', 'ease', 'story', 'compelling', 'enough', 'make', 'actually', 'care', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'person', 'trying', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'also', 'audience', 'perceptions', 'actors', 'previous', 'roles', 'cryptic', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'once', 'watch', 'only', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'ending', 'degenerates', 'nothing', 'more', 'Jason', 'Bourne-style', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'nothing', 'provocative', 'storytelling', 'mode', 'most', 'film.Overall', 'great', 'concept-film', 'entirely', 'new', 'type', 'storytelling', 'are', 'fan', 'action', 'movies', 'love', 'way', 'moments', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'immensely']",Vantage Point
