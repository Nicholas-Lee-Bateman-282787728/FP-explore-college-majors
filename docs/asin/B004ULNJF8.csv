His films routinely gross domestically around $20,000,000.00 but he also has a huge international following.  His everyman tough guy appeal follows in the tradition of McQueen, Bronson, Marvin, Stallone, and Willis but he also has a distinctive Cockney mojo going.  The secret of his success is he picks his projects and collaborators well.  ""Blitz' is based on a book by noted British crime novelist Ken Bruen whose previous work ""London Boulevard"" was adapted to the screen starring Colin Farrell and Ray Winstone.  My quibble with this film is it's a tad derivative.  Scratch Statham's maverick Sergeant Brant and you get Clint Eastwood's Inspector Harry Callahan.  Even the plot involving a serial killer of police officers mirrors that of ""Dirty Harry"".  Regardless, as formulaic as this enterprise may be it is engaging with a good supporting cast notably Paddy Considine as a gay police inspector and director Elliott Lester expertly captures the grunge of Southeast London.

1428172,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004ULNJF8,DVD Verdict,"[38, 40]","Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Based on the cover art and synopsis, Blitz looks like just another Jason Statham vehicle where our muscle-bound hero careens through London, bashing heads until he finds the killer. I was perfectly okay with that. Instead, Blitz is much more of an ensemble piece than it first appears. In addition to Statham's ""killer cop,"" we get his boss Porter Nash (Paddy Considine, The Bourne Ultimatum) a homosexual cop with a past; Elizabeth Falls, a friend who's just got out of rehab after a stint as an undercover drug cop; and Blitz himself (Aiden Gillean, The Wire), a compelling, smarmy killer who makes the perfect villain. It helps that all these characters are played by excellent actors.More importantly, this cast of characters allows Blitz to tell a story that's a little more complicated than ""catch the killer."" Obviously finding Blitz is the central story here, but the film weaves in police violence and corruption, the media's complicity in that violence, drug addiction, homosexuality, and burnout. Of course the film doesn't have the most original things to say about these issues, but it's nice to see a cop film that isn't afraid to balance the action with a bit of intellect. The multiple storylines also allow the film to build tension in the main story. The audience knows who the killer is very early on (and the cops find out not much later). By weaving the other stories into the capture of Blitz, the film builds tension by not proceeding to the obvious showdown between good guys and bad guy. Still, it wouldn't be a Jason Statham film without him kicking in some heads and cracking wise. Blitz doesn't ignore those moments, offering some satisfying cracks from Statham, both physical and verbal.Blitz comes to Blu-ray with a solid AVC-encoded transfer. The film was shot with a lot of wide angle lenses and the picture can get a bit soft around the edges, though that's probably a deliberate choice and not a failing of the transfer. In general, though, detail is strong, and colors are well-saturated. Black levels are consistent and deep, and grain crops up appropriately in a few places. The DTS-HD surround track is fine as well, offering clear dialogue from the center channel, and a bit of atmosphere in the surrounds. The low end gets some use, but not as much as many action films. Subtitles are included for those who have trouble with British accents. Extras include some interviews with the cast and crew and a roll of behind-the-scenes footage.

Statham's new boss is a homosexual which opens up other problems as the two team up to bring the killer to &#34;justice.&#34;As I said in the opening, this is total mediocrity, and it's a shame because there is so much to work with here. Even a hack level Hollywood flick, using the same ingredients, would have spent more time developing the relationship between Statham and his boss. Of course they're at odds to start off but most films would have worked at their coming to terms with each other at the end. Here, it rather just happens. Then there's the black, female cop. Her undercover work left her a junkie who is now trying to straighten out and make sergeant. They needed to give her way more room to develop. I'm glad they  didn't make the killer too clever but, in doing so, they merely made him skin deep.They do give Statham some good lines and he chews them up with fervor. The directing and other production values are on par with the content, but there just isn't anything new happening here. This fails at the script level. I really wish someone would come up with a better vehicle for Statham. He deserves better than this. If you need to see every movie he's ever made, have at it.

Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast.

After purchasing and viewing this DVD I realized why I had not seen this movie advertised at any major U.S. movie theater.This is a British made police drama and even though Jason Statham was the star in the film, there was very little action showing his incredible physical skills and fighting ability.  Further, the only real shooting of a gun was done by the cop-killer.  In fact, the political correctness and dislike of guns by the Brits was easy to spot in this DVD.  As most people know, most British police officers do not carry guns and even our hero SGT. Brant(Jason Statham) did not carry or use a gun until the end of the movie when he took it away from the cop-killer with the use of a tire iron.  At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be an action packed film with Brant using a hockey stick to beat up three car thieves and than being chewed out by his boss for using excessive force.  However, as it turned out, a deranged psychopath began killing police officers who he had contact with in the past. The remainder of the story showed Brant and other British officers investigating the cop killings and finally getting him at the end of the movie.In conclusion,  if you like police dramas you might like this film, but if you are seeking fighting and shooting action scenes, forget it.

1428186,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004ULNJF8,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","A throwback to the hardcore 70's crime drama. Street level thugs and street level cops - neither of whom are playing by the rules. This fantastic retro vibe is recreated in 'Blitz'. It's a difficult style to film and I've seen it done with this level of excellence in just a handful of movies, the Mel Gibson film 'Payback' being one.Muted colors and harshly lit scenes are a true flashback to movies like 'The Enforcer' - a grisly look down into the ugliness of dark alleyways and dingy backrooms. No beautiful runway model crime scene investigators, no rock-n-roll themed music, no happy family waiting at home.Whiskey, harsh flourescents and a couch are all that await you - the job is everything because you have nothing else.Boiled down, 'Blitz' is an ol' fashioned good cop/bad cop dynamic. Jason Statham's brutal street cop, Detective Brant pushed to work with Luke Evans' gay by-the-book office cop, Detective Inspector Stokes. Extreme polar opposites who recognize that they need the other's divergent skillset, forcing them to put aside their differences in order to catch a psychotic thrill killer.Part of the fun is watching them warily test one another, the slow recognition that each is a good cop in his own way. Finally, that bonding of partners that will cement them as buddies over the course of events.Finally, I would like to praise Aiden Gillen. He seems to be one of those actors that can only portray nutters - it's something in his eyes, that weird glint, that touch of madness. I have doubts that he can play 'normal'. But I give him props for doing crazy well; it can be a career maker for some. I'm still hopeful he'll be able to break out of the pigeon-hole, e.g. Dennis Hopper or Malcolm McDowell, and eventually get to work on straight roles, because I really enjoy his performances.My only complaint is the police officer character played by Zawe Ashton. On one hand I sort of got it. But on the other, her character seemed like it was written for a more integral purpose in the original draft of the script, but later revisions/edits moved beyond and she was left behind. Or worse, because her plot line was in the source novel, the filmmakers decided they 'had' to include it for the movie. Unfortunately, her excellent and sincere portrayal felt misplaced and oddly unfinished in the film.

The plot here is fairly formulaic - a serial killer is targetting police officers in a large metropolitan area.  Based on information provided by a police informant, Statham's character is provided with a suspect and Statham's character soon figures out which officers are being targetted and why, but can't prove anything.  Eventually the police set a trap and deal with him.  One sub-plot includes a policewoman who was undercover and became a junkie and is now back on the forece after getting out of rehab.  However, as the pressure mounts,she starts using again.

Yeah.Statham is after a criminal and the police are busters because they don't really have any leads.  But as the investigation unfolds and we find actor Aidan Gillen (whom I recognized but couldn't place--when I was able to place him I realized it was he in the lead villain role in Jackie Chan's Shanghai Knights--he was short of stature but played smug and slightly imperious very well) as the homicidal cop killer, all crick-necked and off-kilter demented, he seems both less than a match for Statham's thuggish cop and his well-coiffed partner who is supposed to make Statham's character a little uncomfortable because he's homosexual (though never aggressively so).  As the film plays the partnership out the truth for both of them is that they're a bit of outside within their own policing world but they make a good team as they are determined to catch the killer.  You know how it ends.Along the way we get a sub-story of a multi-faceted junkie cop that the film helps us develop a really sympathy for and this gives the film more emotional depth.  Of course the criminal has past unexpected ties to Statham's character.  Part of the fun is seeing what this was and how it plays out in his character but...he ends up being pretty one-note.  Still, an enjoyable film and a good (though not great) vehicle for Statham, Gillen, and Zawe Ashton (the junkie cop).",4,cop-killer versus killer-cop flick hits the spot,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1472,"['Why', 'did', 'watch', 'wanted', 'see', 'gritty', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'kick', 'heads', 'Did', 'get', 'Yeah.Statham', 'criminal', 'police', 'are', 'busters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'leads', 'investigation', 'unfolds', 'find', 'actor', 'Aidan', 'Gillen', 'whom', 'recognized', 'could', ""n't"", 'place', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'place', 'realized', 'was', 'lead', 'villain', 'role', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Shanghai', 'Knights', 'was', 'short', 'stature', 'played', 'smug', 'slightly', 'imperious', 'very', 'well', 'homicidal', 'cop', 'killer', 'crick-necked', 'off-kilter', 'demented', 'less', 'match', 'Statham', 'thuggish', 'cop', 'well-coiffed', 'partner', 'who', 'supposed', 'make', 'Statham', 'character', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'homosexual', 'never', 'aggressively', 'so', 'film', 'partnership', 'truth', ""'re"", 'bit', 'outside', 'own', 'policing', 'world', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'are', 'determined', 'catch', 'killer', 'know', 'how', 'ends.Along', 'way', 'get', 'sub-story', 'multi-faceted', 'junkie', 'cop', 'film', 'develop', 'really', 'sympathy', 'film', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'course', 'criminal', 'past', 'unexpected', 'ties', 'Statham', 'character', 'Part', 'fun', 'seeing', 'what', 'was', 'how', 'out', 'character', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'one-note', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'vehicle', 'Statham', 'Gillen', 'Zawe', 'Ashton', 'junkie', 'cop']",Blitz
