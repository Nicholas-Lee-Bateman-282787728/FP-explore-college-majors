I have always been a big fan of the Pee Wee movies and shows.  I wish that he would have been wiser in his personal life and I'd feel less creepy having my kids watch these shows.  Regardless, my kids love this boxset.  I love watching these shows with them too.  This is a good price for a lot of Pee Wee entertainment.  Santa brought this one to us for Christmas.  The included Christmas special is also very neat to watch, he had a lot of Hollywood stars on that show, it was amazing to see how many people wanted to be a part of Pee Wee's Christmas special.",5,A whole lot of Pee Wee.,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,661,"['are', 'familiar', 'show', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'buy', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'movies', 'shows', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wiser', 'personal', 'life', ""'d"", 'feel', 'less', 'creepy', 'having', 'kids', 'watch', 'shows', 'Regardless', 'kids', 'love', 'boxset', 'love', 'watching', 'shows', 'too', 'good', 'price', 'lot', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'entertainment', 'Santa', 'brought', 'one', 'Christmas', 'included', 'Christmas', 'special', 'also', 'very', 'neat', 'watch', 'had', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'wanted', 'be', 'part', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Christmas', 'special']",N/A

I remember watching it with my brother, and sometimes with my cousins who would have sleepovers at my house, and we'd always have a good laugh.  We'd laugh at the show and say it was silly.  That classic theme song sung by Cyndi Lauper and the show openings were great.  I even remember seeing an advertisement for a new show coming to tv, Perfect Strangers, that was to become another favorite show of mine, during a commercial break while watching this show.Watching it now as an adult, I can see how odd, crazy and great the show was.  It's still very funny.  My family watched the dvds together and we all got a good laugh.  Sometimes, I focus on the show and it's ability to make me laugh now.  Other times, I really get into the nostalgia as the show totally takes me right back to childhood.  That feeling of sitting on the sofa, or a sleeping bag on the floor, in the living room, watching our old tv set, and eating a bowl of cereal.",5,Hilarious Show,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,1051,"['What', 'trip', 'back', 'Saturday', 'mornings', '80s', 'while', 'used', 'watch', 'almost', 'Saturday', 'remember', 'watching', 'brother', 'sometimes', 'cousins', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'sleepovers', 'house', ""'d"", 'always', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'show', 'say', 'was', 'silly', 'classic', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'show', 'openings', 'were', 'great', 'even', 'remember', 'seeing', 'advertisement', 'new', 'show', 'coming', 'tv', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'was', 'become', 'favorite', 'show', 'mine', 'commercial', 'break', 'watching', 'show.Watching', 'now', 'adult', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'odd', 'crazy', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'family', 'watched', 'dvds', 'together', 'got', 'good', 'laugh', 'Sometimes', 'focus', 'show', 'ability', 'make', 'now', 'Other', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'nostalgia', 'show', 'totally', 'right', 'back', 'childhood', 'feeling', 'sitting', 'sofa', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'floor', 'living', 'room', 'watching', 'old', 'tv', 'set', 'eating', 'bowl', 'cereal']",N/A
