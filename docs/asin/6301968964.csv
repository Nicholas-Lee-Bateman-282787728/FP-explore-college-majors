279984,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301968964,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","HUMORESQUE received a well-deserved Best Music Oscar nomination.This perfect amalgam of melodrama and classical music stars Joan Crawford as a wealthy socialite who befriends single-minded violinist John Garfield. The deeper this married lady falls for him the more Garfield (as Paul Boray) obsessess over his career.Violinist Isaac Stern stands in Garfield's playing. Featured music includes interpretations of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Bizet's Carmen Suite, the title song (by Anton&iacute;n Dvor&aacute;k) and Etude in G flat major by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin. Chain-smoking Oscar Levant, a close associate of George Gershwin, brilliantly plays excerpts of two of his Preludes. Levant, as Boray's long-time friend Sid Jeffers, offers him sound advice and also supplies a needed bit of levity in what is an ever-darkening story, one that ends in inevitable tragedy.Young Robert Blake is ideal as Paul at age 11. Miss Crawford demonstrates truly enormous talents here; her doomed lover, Helen Wright is a woman you won't soon forget. Mr. Garfield is equally engaging as the unknown musician who, with Helen's help, becomes a national sensation. His steady, masculine performance anchors this movie and provides the perfect foil for Joan's several emotional scenes in what is a rare classic of the studio era.

279985,A1RMT7FY2B5NME,6301968964,B. G. Carroll,"[9, 9]","At last, HUMORESQUE is on DVD in a fairly decent print! This film, made during the mid 1940s classical music craze that gripped Hollywood (contemporaneous examples include A SONG TO REMEMBER, DECEPTION [with Bette Davis, actually shot on adjoining stages at Warners!], SONG OF LOVE and RHAPSODY IN BLUE) is one of the best and most elaborate. It is hard to imagine a film like this being made today, with huge tranches of classsical works taking up screen time and being rendered so wonderfully. Crawford is at her most maudlin and overacts sublimely. The real outstanding performance however is John Garfield who, in spite of looking like a hoodlum, convinces as a violin prodigy. The unintentionally funny lines (penned by Clifford Odets, no less, mining his play GOLDEN BOY into the bargain!) come thick and fast e.g. ""Bad Manners! The infallible sign of genius"" or ""Martinis are an acquired taste...like Ravel!"".A grand Warner cast of stalwarts lends support and Franz Waxman adapts and arranges some marvellous music, played exquisitely by Isaac Stern. Oscar Levant contributes his usual laconic humour and also some terrific pianism. Once again, Ernest Haller works miracles with his extraordinary photography [check the anazing shot of Garfield through a Brandy glass at the party scene near the beginning - it took a day to light it]. Jean Negulesco directs with some flair, effortlessly conjuring up 1940s New York making you wish it was as hip and sophisticated today ~ and the final knockout sequence where Crawford walks into the sea (a la A STAR IS BORN) to the strains of Wagner's Liebestod in a superb arrangement for violin, piano & orchestra by Waxman, is so over the top, you can't help but love it. Superbly photographed and edited, it is almost orgasmic! No matter that Crawford's radio would have needed speakers the size of Carnegie Hall for her to be able to hear the music on the beach...that's Hollywood !The DVD looks pretty good but the print used has clearly suffered with age. No digital restoration was possible as the original camera negative has not survived. Nice featurette on the music and a typically lavish, overblown trailer are the welcome extras. I wish there had been a commentary track as there is so much I wanted to know - for instance, was any of it shot on location and if so, where? All in all however, it's a one-of-a-kind movie and should be in every buff's collection. 5 STARS!",5,"""She's as complex as a Bach fugue!""",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2427,"['last', 'HUMORESQUE', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'decent', 'print', 'film', 'made', 'mid', '1940s', 'classical', 'music', 'craze', 'gripped', 'Hollywood', 'contemporaneous', 'examples', 'include', 'A', 'SONG', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'DECEPTION', '[', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'actually', 'shot', 'adjoining', 'stages', 'Warners', ']', 'SONG', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'RHAPSODY', 'IN', 'BLUE', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'elaborate', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'huge', 'tranches', 'classsical', 'works', 'taking', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'being', 'rendered', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'Crawford', 'most', 'maudlin', 'sublimely', 'real', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'however', 'John', 'Garfield', 'who', 'spite', 'looking', 'hoodlum', 'convinces', 'violin', 'prodigy', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'lines', 'penned', 'Clifford', 'Odets', 'less', 'mining', 'play', 'GOLDEN', 'BOY', 'bargain', 'come', 'thick', 'fast', 'e.g', 'Bad', 'Manners', 'infallible', 'sign', 'genius', 'Martinis', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'Ravel', '.A', 'grand', 'Warner', 'cast', 'stalwarts', 'lends', 'support', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'adapts', 'marvellous', 'music', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Isaac', 'Stern', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'usual', 'laconic', 'humour', 'also', 'terrific', 'pianism', 'Once', 'again', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'miracles', 'extraordinary', 'photography', '[', 'check', 'anazing', 'shot', 'Garfield', 'Brandy', 'glass', 'party', 'scene', 'beginning', 'took', 'day', 'light', ']', 'Jean', 'Negulesco', 'flair', 'effortlessly', 'conjuring', 'up', '1940s', 'New', 'York', 'making', 'wish', 'was', 'hip', 'sophisticated', 'today', '~', 'final', 'knockout', 'sequence', 'where', 'Crawford', 'sea', 'la', 'A', 'STAR', 'IS', 'BORN', 'strains', 'Wagner', 'Liebestod', 'superb', 'arrangement', 'violin', 'piano', 'orchestra', 'Waxman', 'so', 'top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Superbly', 'photographed', 'edited', 'almost', 'orgasmic', 'matter', 'Crawford', 'radio', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'speakers', 'size', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'music', 'beach', 'Hollywood', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'print', 'used', 'clearly', 'suffered', 'age', 'digital', 'restoration', 'was', 'possible', 'original', 'camera', 'negative', 'not', 'survived', 'Nice', 'featurette', 'music', 'typically', 'lavish', 'overblown', 'trailer', 'are', 'welcome', 'extras', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'commentary', 'track', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'know', 'instance', 'was', 'location', 'so', 'where', 'however', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'buff', 'collection', '5', 'STARS']",Humoresque VHS

So rivetting is Garfield and Crawford's performances that even without the great music it would have still been a great tragic love story (and I'm not one who cares for this genre). The volatility between the two lovers is what makes this movie so great; perhaps because they're complete opposites, or perhaps because the relationship is illicit. No matter, the chemistry between Garfield and Crawford is difficult to deny.Another point. As a violinist myself Garfield does the most believable job of ANY actor I've seen in ANY movie, and I've seen almost all, that actually appears to be playing, it's almost unbelievable.Finally, Oscar Levant, who was a great pianist in his own right, especially as an interpreter of Gershwin, does a splendid job as the comic counterbalance to Garfield's brooding intensity, and thought he actually stole some of the scenes with his sarcastic wit.This movie has it all: great music, great story, great acting.

The date was etched in my brain because I have NEVER been so overwhelmed by pure genius in my life before or since. I have given this movie as a present to all my  friends (birthdays, holidays, etc.). I have watched this film as my  birthday present TO MYSELF. Everyone who sees this film agrees---BRILLIANT.  Joan Crawford and John Garfield play the ultimate codependant couple, long  before modern pop-psychology popularized and distorted the term  &quot;codependancy.&quot; Joan Crawford had won her Academy Award for  1945's &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; in 1946, during the filming of  &quot;Humoresque,&quot; and it shows. Joan Crawford was never more  confident, brooding, steaming, sensual, intelligent or intense on film than  in &quot;Humoresque.&quot; Everything was perfect for this, the ultimate  film noir----black and white cinematography, art direction, set decoration,  costume design (legendary MGM costume/fashion designer Adrian came out of  retirement just to do Joan Crawford's gowns), make-up, script, cast, and of  course, Joan Crawford's acting and perfectly architectured face. Every  scene and every line are executed perfectly. Post-&quot;Mommie  Dearest&quot; film fans should watch this and other Joan Crawford films to  get a clearer assessment and appreciation for her work, if not for the  human being herself. Oscar Levant is hilarious as John Garfield's  piano-playing best friend, Sid. Virtuoso violinist Isaac Stern played  violin on the soundtrack (WHICH HOPEFULLY SOME RECORD COMPANY WILL RELEASE  ON CD SOMEDAY), and physically played onscreen in John Garfield's closeups  by placing his arm up Garfield's sleeve. The final sequence with Joan  Crawford's suicidal heroine walking into the sea to the strains of  Garfield's radio performance of Wagner's &quot;Liebstod&quot; on violin  (accompanied by full orchestra) is as cathartic as catharsis will ever be  on film. This sequence was recently acknowledged when the director of  Madonna's video, &quot;The Power Of Goodbye,&quot; borrowed upon it as the  basis for the storyline of the video, with a  different choice at the end.  It just shows how far we have come as a society in the ability to examine  self-esteem issues, such as codependancy. If you only buy one video in your  life, buy this one.

279991,AVV1ACH67XI85,6301968964,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[8, 25]","I love anything with Joan Crawford or Bette Davis, mainly for the camp element. But ""Humoresque"" is a big fat YAWN.As you must know by now by reading other reviews, this is a ""story"" (I use the term loosely) about a sex-starved married society woman who falls in love with a ""If I wasn't a violin virtuoso, I coulda been a contender in the boxing ring"" musician.While this must have seemed like an ""exciting"" premise at the time, this is a ""prop-open-the-eyelids-with-toothpicks"" kind of flick, which was punctuated with unintentionally hilarious moments -- moments, including the penultimate scene (which I won't ""give away"") which make this worth an evening of popcorn and bitchy backtalk to the TV screen.As for the two stars: Joan (""Helen Wright"") was getting a bit long in the tooth to be a glamour girl, and although she had absolutely fabulous costumes and the sort of wave in her hair that must have taken a team of hairdressers to create, she still looked a bit too old for any kind of hot stud to start foaming at the mouth for.John Garfield (""Paul Boray"") also was too old to play this part, and far, far too old to be living at home with his parents.There is not a shred of chemistry between these two and I got the distinct impression that John kept saying to himself during his ""love scenes"" with Joan, ""Ah, hell, it's a paycheck --if they want me to kiss the old broad, sure, I'll do it.""The ""story"" kicks off with an endless series of scenes about Boray's childhood -- and for about 30-45 minutes I kept asking myself, ""When the hell does this movie start?"" (Note: Robert Blake [!] played the ""young"" Paul Boray!)Finally, a good 30 years later, Paul somehow finds himself playing violin in the fabulous home of Helen Wright, who apparently has nothing to do for the next 90 minutes but smoke and drink and wear stunning sequin-encrusted gowns.One of the bizarre things about this film was to give Crawford a prop -- eyeglasses. She puts them on; she takes them off; she asks someone to fetch them for her; she puts them on and takes them off and on and off and on and... -- Jesus, Joan, darling, make up your mind, for God's sake!There is absolutely no reason for them to have used this prop other than to make Crawford: 1) appear more intelligent; 2) appear nearsighted; 3) give her something to do with her hands other than pick up a shotglass and down its contents; 4) help her to read her cue cards; or 5) distract from the fact that she was starting to look like a transvestite.One of the great things about watching older films is the mindset that people had to deal with. In ""Humoresque"" it was the supposedly ""shocking"" main relationship between a married woman and a single man. Nowadays, we'd be saying, ""Uh-huh, so what?""The movie is worth watching to hear the fabulous music of Isaac Stern and to see how they made it appear that John was playing the violin, as well as to hear and see the superb and totally underrated Oscar Levant, as Paul's chump buddy Sid, who was an astonishing pianist who could toss off a complex Gershwin prelude with the sort of panache you'd expect Gershwin to do himself.But other than the music, it gets old really fast watching Joan upend every glass she sees into her mouth and for Joan and John to smoke enough cigarettes to have given lung cancer to everyone on the set.At any rate, if you can survive long enough to see Joan's big scene at the end, it's definitely worth it for the good laugh you'll have.

His mother buys him a violin for a birthday present and from then on Paul practices constantly. As he grows older he becomes a highly-skilled violinist, but with no wealthy friends his great potential has no where to go. Until he meets the wealthy and unhappily married socialite Helen Wright (Joan Crawford), who is instantly drawn to Paul after hearing him play. Helen is used to getting everything she wants in life, and Paul's fiercely independent attitude upsets her.Despite a rocky start they soon agree on one thing: with the right friends Paul could become one of the most famous violinists of all time. So Helen introduces Paul to her wealthy friends and in no time at all Paul is booked with numerous concerts. But Paul is much more than a smart investment to Helen, and the more they see of each other the less they can deny their passionate feelings for each other. Paul's family disaproves of their relationship, but Paul won't listen to anyone try to stop him from seeing Helen.Forgetting the fact that a charming young woman (Joan Chandler) is already in love with him, and that Helen is married, he begins a dangerous affair with her, not realizing the consequences it could have in regards to his career. His best friend (Oscar Levant) also shares a love for music, but can do little to convince Paul that the affair is destined to fail. Paul's career as a violinist is so busy that he doesn't always have time to spend with Helen, and she begins to resent this more and more.When Helen's husband grants her a divorce, she rushes to Paul to tell him the good news, only to realize that Paul's first love is and always has been music. Even after all the arguing and fighting Helen and Paul have gone through, they're still deeply in love with each other. After being told off by Paul's protective mother though, she decides that she isn't willing to come between Paul and his beloved music. Paul is then left to pick up the pieces of his shattered life and try to move on with his career.Humoresque starred two of the greatest stars of the 1940's, John Garfield and Joan Crawford, in one of the most unforgettable screen romances of all time. Garfield was of course famous for playing tough guys, and to see him play a sensitive violinist (with a dark side of course) so convincingly proved just how great of an actor he was. Crawford was likewise fantastic playing another ""bad girl"" without morals. As for Oscar Levant, I think he deserved a best supporting actor oscar for his wonderful performance. He was really a scene stealer and his sharp wit combined with his great talent as a piano player made him a huge asset to the film.And of course there's the beautiful music of Humoresque which is practically a character in the movie. Rarely have I heard so many masterpieces of classical music in one movie. John Garfield's violin playing was actually done by Isaac Stern, but the incredible contortionist style method they used was so convincing that when Garfield toured the country on publicity tours for this movie he was frequently asked to play the violin! They explain the technique they used to make his violin playing scenes convincing in the brief featurette ""The Music of Humoresque."" Although the original soundtrack is unavailable, there is an awesome CD by Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg titled Humoresque which features a modern version of the film's soundtrack.

The black and white photography is rich, glossy, and superb, the luminescent glow behind Crawford's close-ups almost transforming this middle-aged warhorse into a fallen madonna. The screenplay anticipates Garfield's role in ""Body and Soul"" as he claws his way up from poverty using a bowstring instead of fists. For a tough guy, we still believe in his poetic soul and no one from that era was better at combining the two. Then too, no film has communicated an on-screen classical score more effectively than this, as Crawford is alternately beguiled, seduced, and overwhelmed by pulsating strains from the great composers. And, of course, there's that all-time smashing finale so lushly romantic, I'm still picking seaweed from my hair. I'm glad the screenplay gives an obscure contract player like Ruth Nelson a chance to show her thespic talents. Her face-off with Crawford over the direction of Garfield's affections is an epic one, though she's probably a shade too aristocratic for the long-suffering motherly role. Moreover, there are the many memorable throw-away lines, one could expect from a stellar cast that includes Hollywood's master cynic, the mordant Oscar Levant. In fact, his self-effacing personality and casual witticisms are so distractively entertaining, they threaten to undo the entire melodrama. For fans of Levant, it's a showcase, and I wouldn't be surprised if many of those sarcasms were his own. (If only the writers could have dispensed with that dreary stereotype of the wholesome-girl-in-waiting, this time the fresh-faced Peggy Knudsen.) With this film, director Negulesco proves he could spread the soap suds as smoothly as a Douglas Sirk or a John M. Stahl.

Garfield's attractive but implacable persona (he was considered for the role of Stanley in the original stage production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;) meant that he could turn on the charm or turn off the customer at a flick of the switch. Paul Boray knows he has enormous talent and he's ready to share it -- but not his life. When he meets a wealthy neurotic who finds him irresistible you just know there's going to be trouble, particularly when the socialite is none other than Joan Crawford at the peak of her dramatic power. Kids today tend to make fun of Crawford's acting,especially the post-1950 excesses; but the fact is she had an unusually intense presence and a razor-sharp sense of concentration and timing. This is undoubtedly her best performance: her last ten minutes you will never forget. (Incidently, her character doesn't appear till thirty minutes into the picture.) Garfield and Crawford dominate the story (the scenes where she watches him perform leave little to the imagination), so there's not much left for anyone else to do. Ruth Nelson is strong as Paul's disapproving mother, and a young actress named Joan Chandler (you can see her in Hitchcock's &quot;Rope&quot;) is winning as Paul's pre-fame sweetheart, who waits patiently in the wings -- or, in her case, the orchestra section. Oscar Levant as Paul's accompanist-friend does the cynical curmudgeon thing he was later to do in &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. It's not as amusing here, partly because this is a serious drama and partly because Levant was five years younger. He has a great line though: when a society matron asks him his relationship to Paul, he says it's the same as that of George Sand to Chopin. The poor woman doesn't register a blink. The screenplay, co-written by Clifford Odets, is controlled with a depth of feeling that later evaded director Jean Negulesco, when he started doing glossy Fox comedies; and it's a shame that &quot;Humoresque&quot; was evidently ignored by the Academy. With its moody atmosphere and magnetic stars, it's one of the finest films of the Forties.",5,Garfield fiddles while Joan burns,996192000,"07 27, 2001",2001,2322,"['John', 'Garfield', 'n', 'eacute', 'Julius', 'Garfinkle', 'was', 'rough', 'guy', 'sensitive', 'edge', 'part', 'Paul', 'Boray', 'quot', 'Humoresque', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'order', 'kid', 'streets', 'who', 'famous', 'concert', 'violinist', 'Garfield', 'attractive', 'implacable', 'persona', 'was', 'considered', 'role', 'Stanley', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'meant', 'could', 'turn', 'charm', 'turn', 'off', 'customer', 'flick', 'switch', 'Paul', 'Boray', 'enormous', 'talent', 'ready', 'share', 'not', 'life', 'When', 'wealthy', 'neurotic', 'who', 'irresistible', 'just', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'trouble', 'particularly', 'when', 'socialite', 'none', 'other', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'peak', 'dramatic', 'power', 'Kids', 'today', 'tend', 'make', 'fun', 'Crawford', 'acting', 'especially', 'post-1950', 'excesses', 'fact', 'had', 'unusually', 'intense', 'presence', 'razor-sharp', 'sense', 'concentration', 'timing', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'performance', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Incidently', 'character', ""n't"", 'appear', 'till', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'picture', 'Garfield', 'Crawford', 'dominate', 'story', 'scenes', 'where', 'perform', 'leave', 'little', 'imagination', 'not', 'much', 'left', 'anyone', 'else', 'do', 'Ruth', 'Nelson', 'strong', 'Paul', 'disapproving', 'mother', 'young', 'actress', 'named', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'can', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'quot', 'Rope', 'quot', 'winning', 'Paul', 'pre-fame', 'sweetheart', 'who', 'patiently', 'wings', 'case', 'orchestra', 'section', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'Paul', 'accompanist-friend', 'cynical', 'curmudgeon', 'thing', 'was', 'later', 'do', 'quot', 'American', 'Paris', 'quot', 'not', 'amusing', 'here', 'partly', 'serious', 'drama', 'partly', 'Levant', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'younger', 'great', 'line', 'when', 'society', 'matron', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'same', 'George', 'Sand', 'Chopin', 'poor', 'woman', ""n't"", 'register', 'blink', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Clifford', 'Odets', 'controlled', 'depth', 'feeling', 'later', 'evaded', 'director', 'Jean', 'Negulesco', 'when', 'started', 'doing', 'glossy', 'Fox', 'comedies', 'shame', 'quot', 'Humoresque', 'quot', 'was', 'evidently', 'ignored', 'Academy', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'magnetic', 'stars', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'Forties']",Humoresque VHS

My tastes for movies and music run to the low road, like THE BENNY GOODMAN STORY or THE GLENN MILLER STORY.Now, a violin player can't succeed by appealing to the crowd directly, because violin players succeed or fail in an upper rarefied market that is subsidized by patrons of the arts.  So the violin player needs a patron.  Or patroness.I rather identify with John Garfield's talented temperamental artist as he bitches and moans every inch of his way toward success.  I'm something of a social bastard myself.  (Probably why I never get invited back.)  The set-up was nicely structured; the early years of the young violinist; not too much to bore me.  My favorite character was his piano-playing friend, played by Oscar Levant, who played a nice common-sense calming influence on John Garfield's wild ranting about his music, picking apart minor weaknesses in his own playing, and complaining that ""nobody appreciates me.""The violinist finds his patroness in the Joan Crawford character.The chemistry between Crawford and Garfield was fun to watch, as they attacked each other as much as they both seemed to need each other.

280000,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,6301968964,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 6]","It's interesting to watch a classic film starring well-known actors and not having any idea of what the story will be about. I had seen HUMORESQUE listed as a well-known Joan Crawford film so I decided to watch it expecting some sort of a romantic light-hearded comedy, which of course, is not the genre Crawford if famous for. I didn't realize that HUMORESQUE has nothing to do with humor but is actually a genre of romantic music. I don't think HUMORESQUE was the best title for this film, but it did catch my attention.HUMORESQUE is almost a long concert of classical music. If you are a fan of classical music, this movie is worth your time. I had no idea that such a big part of this movie would be classical music performances, especially violin music. This is just my personal preference, but I'm not a fan of violin music.The movie is off to an interesting start. I immediately recognized the young, adorable kid with a head of black hair as actor Robert Blake. Here was ""Bobby Blake"" decades before his troubles and a cute kid and talented he was. Little Paul Boray wants a violin for his birthday and thanks to his loving mother that is what he gets. He spends his youth practicing and works his way forward. Suddenly he is grown up and I guess would be in his early 20's. Now, adult Paul Boray is played by John Garfield...an actor almost in his mid-30's at the time. The age difference through me off because John actually looked older than he was.An interesting fact of the movie is that Joan Crawford does not make her first appearance until 30 minutes into the movie. Nothing is rushed in this film. I have watched several Joan Crawford films lately and this is the first time I have seen her as beautiful. Her features are not as severe. She looks more natural and it's easy to believe how her character Helen Wright would be the toast of the town. Again, here is a movie where Joan plays a woman married to a much older man but in love with a younger man. But this time the younger man looks older than her.There is a lot of over the top high drama in the film as people begin to realize the relationship Paul and Helen have. Helen knows Paul is in love with his music more than with her. The constant musical concerts got to be too much for me, and I was amazed at how it looked like Garfield was playing the violin. In the extra features, Garfield's daughter explains how ""Garfield's"" hands were really Isaac Stern's. Here is another amazing thing about classic films.

He's looking for his big break, and with her contacts, she is able to open doors for him.  It's the beginning of what becomes an uneasy romance with her, as he must battle his music with her, and she must battle with her inner demons with him.  Crawford, linebacker shoulders in place, plays her usual mix of tough vulnerability with intensity.  Garfield is his usual self as well, hardened by life on the outside, trying to fight his love for her on the inside.  The rest of the cast is fine.  The older Crawford got, the more artificial she became, and since I'm not a fan, I find the film hard to swallow just based on her alone.  Ernest Haller does a terrific job lighting her, with lots of shadows used to great effect.  In fact, apart from the stirring music, the photography is the best thing in the film, with a number of striking film noir-type shots.  The dialogue tries for greatness, but except for a few biting comments, fails to be anything but ordinary and melodramatic.  By the end of the film, I was tired of the melodrama, and although the ending is the best part of the movie, I was not unhappy to see it end.  Fans of Crawford will no doubt love this film.

It would be unfair to say Humoresque is a better film than Mildred Pierce, considering how different the two films are. Mildred Pierce was gritty and dark and strived for harsh realism. Humoresque is romantic and tragic - beautifully written, acted, and filmed. There are moments in movies that linger in your mind a long time after viewing.. The finale of Humoresque is one of those moments. I'm certain I will never forget Joan Crawford's melancholy walk along the sea shore in the moonlight. It is one of the most artistic scenes ever captured on film...and all the emotion Joan goes through is genuine and deep. It is definitely a glimpse through to the heart of Joan Crawford, vulnerable and beautiful, defiant and strong. For in real life, Joan Crawford was never loved. And her character in Humoresque was, as Joan described, &quot;a woman with too much time on her hands and too much love in her heart.&quot; Perhaps that was the real Joan Crawford, a woman clinging to her career and the fans that loved her, when nobody else did.

The movie is about a violinist named Paul Boray (John Garfield) who is driven to be a great violinist, but his career isn't getting anywhere until he meets a wealthy unhappily married socialite named Helen Wright (Joan Crawford), who helps him advance his career.  In the process, Helen and Paul begin a relationship, but Paul is so driven that the relationship isn't blossoming like it could and should.  Besides that, Helen is a self-centered alcoholic.  I won't give anything away, watch to find out how everything unfolds.  This movie has a lot of memorable lines and a lot of memorable scenes.  Crawford was at the peak of her career in the mid-1940s and looks her absolute best in this movie, in my opinion.  The ending of the movie is, in my opinion, one of the greatest endings to a movie in Hollywood history.This movie also stars pianist Oscar Levant, Joan Chandler, Ruth Nelson, J. Carrol Naish, Paul Cavanaugh, and a very young Robert Blake (Bobby Blake).  Oscar Levant is very entertaining in this movie, as he provides some comic relief and some wise cracks along with some excellent piano playing.  Every cast member chosen fit their part perfectly and each did a great job.  Joan Chandler's acting is excellent.The musical score by Franz Waxman is great.  The movie has a ton of music throughout, including the title song and music from some famous composers as well.One of the extras on this DVD is a short 9-minute segment called ""The Music Of Humoresque"", in which the music of the movie is discussed.I highly recommend this movie.",5,"""Is that all you do is play the violin?""",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1886,"['wrote', 'very', 'brief', 'review', 'Humoresque', 'when', 'reviewing', 'TCM', 'Greatest', 'Classic', 'Legends', 'Joan', 'Crawford', '4-DVD', 'set', '5', 'months', 'ago', 'want', 'write', 'longer', 'review', 'individual', 'movie', 'Humoresque', '1946', 'classic', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'highly', 'successful', 'tenure', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'mid-1940s', 'early', '1950s', 'movie', 'violinist', 'named', 'Paul', 'Boray', 'John', 'Garfield', 'who', 'driven', 'be', 'great', 'violinist', 'career', ""n't"", 'getting', 'anywhere', 'wealthy', 'unhappily', 'married', 'socialite', 'named', 'Helen', 'Wright', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'who', 'advance', 'career', 'process', 'Helen', 'Paul', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'so', 'driven', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'blossoming', 'could', 'should', 'Helen', 'self-centered', 'alcoholic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'everything', 'movie', 'lot', 'memorable', 'lines', 'lot', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Crawford', 'was', 'peak', 'career', 'mid-1940s', 'absolute', 'best', 'movie', 'opinion', 'ending', 'movie', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'endings', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'history.This', 'movie', 'also', 'pianist', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'Ruth', 'Nelson', 'J.', 'Carrol', 'Naish', 'Paul', 'Cavanaugh', 'very', 'young', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'Bobby', 'Blake', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'comic', 'relief', 'wise', 'cracks', 'excellent', 'piano', 'playing', 'cast', 'member', 'chosen', 'fit', 'part', 'perfectly', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Joan', 'Chandler', 'acting', 'excellent.The', 'musical', 'score', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'great', 'movie', 'ton', 'music', 'including', 'title', 'song', 'music', 'famous', 'composers', 'well.One', 'extras', 'DVD', 'short', '9-minute', 'segment', 'called', 'Music', 'Humoresque', 'music', 'movie', 'discussed.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Humoresque VHS

Both characters are a piece of work, resulting in fireworks (both happy and otherwise) and some genuine complexity as Garfield moves up the ranks and becomes the toast of the classical music world.  The real star of the movie, however, is the music, which is often featured front and center, and at length.  If you're not partial to energetic, dramatic classical music performances, that aspect of the film may bore you a little, but if you do enjoy that sort of thing, you're in for a treat.Oscar Levant's turn as Garfield's cynical friend, a capable piano player but not quite good enough to be a star performer himself, is also a highlight of ""Humoresque"".  I liked the way he idly played old Gershwin Tin Pan Alley numbers as he argued with his friend about this and that.The DVD of ""Humoresque"" features a sharp, clean print of the film and an interesting special feature that shows the clever ways the film made non-violinist John Garfield appear like a virtuoso on screen.

Everything she did was over the top (even more so with those eye-brows) and yet she came out of it looking great.  She was a ""working"" Star.  While it was ""Mildred Pierce"" that took the Oscar, ""Humoresque"" is Joan's darkest and deepest performance.  It seems to pick up where Mildred Pierce left off, as if Joan sold the restaurant chain, moved to the big city and drank herself into a pit of despair.The Story:Garfield is a son-of-a-grocer violinist determined to go to the top, Levant plays side-kick piano, Joan picks up the tab.So what's the big deal?For one thing, Garfield plays a mean fiddle - I'm not talking Pa Kettle, either: the kid's got chops.  Levant plays himself (a talented pianist and genius who in real life defined the concept of bi-polar manic depressive).  Joan plays the near-sighted (she wears glasses as some kind of metaphor) heiress-socialite who takes Garfield's career (and ultimately Garfield) under her wing.  Thing is, Garfield likes her a whole lot, but he likes the violin better.  What transpires is a self-destructive affair that shows some remarkable sexual chemistry (apparently this was an ""off-the-set thing"" too), and some unusually dark twists of character.  The performances are fantastic, particularly in the supporting cast: Mother, Girlfriend, and Crawford's husband (appropriately underplayed by Paul Cavanaugh) are all great.This movie delivers Film Noire in one of it's strangest forms.  In a genre normally reserved for gangsters and private dicks, the musicians and the music are given a sinister light: most sets are devoid of significant illumination, everything coming from one or two on-set lamps and spots that the actors wander into; the images are all texture, high-contrast, rim lighting and low key - veteran cinematographer Ernest Haller ( ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Rebel Without A Cause"", and ""Lilies Of The Field"") delivers a masterpiece of ""negative space"".  The visual composition and mise-en-scene are remarkably efficient.The editing is also spectacular, moving from the ""invisible"" style of Hollywood narrative, to some pretty wild montages of ""big city life"" and the crash of `28.  But where the cuts really come into play is in that next-to-last scene where the waves roll in; the last walk along the beach; that guy with the dog...The music (almost wall to wall), and the on screen-performances are masterfully employed as emotional devices, all leading to Garfield's (and Crawford's) final performance.Yeah, I know it's just melodrama, but  I think Crawford and Co. genuinely believed in what they were doing  (maybe even Levant believed), and so many moments that might have been badly handled (Joan drunk in the night club) or just ""cute"" (Garfield's father's obsession with statistics) actually move quite well.  In the end they've made a remarkably affecting film.And how does it all end?In real life Joan got another Oscar and lived to work with Spielberg; Garfield survived the McCarthy hearings without naming names, but was dead a year later;  Oscar Levant did a night-time talk-show on live TV where, immobilized by despair, depression, and addiction, he might be found collapsed over his keyboard mid-performance.",4,John Fiddles While Joan Burns,1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,3379,"['did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'son', 'hope', 'never', 'bothered', 'words', 'effect.I', 'always', 'liked', 'Crawford', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nothin', 'fruity', 'just', 'always', ""y'know"", 'liked', 'Everything', 'did', 'was', 'top', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'eye-brows', 'yet', 'came', 'out', 'looking', 'great', 'was', 'working', 'Star', 'was', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'took', 'Oscar', 'Humoresque', 'Joan', 'darkest', 'deepest', 'performance', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'left', 'off', 'Joan', 'sold', 'restaurant', 'chain', 'moved', 'big', 'city', 'drank', 'pit', 'despair.The', 'Story', 'Garfield', 'son-of-a-grocer', 'violinist', 'determined', 'go', 'top', 'Levant', 'side-kick', 'piano', 'Joan', 'up', 'tab.So', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'thing', 'Garfield', 'mean', 'fiddle', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'either', 'kid', 'got', 'chops', 'Levant', 'talented', 'pianist', 'genius', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'defined', 'concept', 'bi-polar', 'manic', 'depressive', 'Joan', 'near-sighted', 'glasses', 'kind', 'metaphor', 'heiress-socialite', 'who', 'Garfield', 'career', 'ultimately', 'Garfield', 'wing', 'Thing', 'Garfield', 'whole', 'lot', 'violin', 'better', 'What', 'self-destructive', 'affair', 'remarkable', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'apparently', 'was', 'off-the-set', 'thing', 'too', 'unusually', 'dark', 'twists', 'character', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Mother', 'Girlfriend', 'Crawford', 'husband', 'appropriately', 'underplayed', 'Paul', 'Cavanaugh', 'are', 'great.This', 'movie', 'delivers', 'Film', 'Noire', 'one', 'strangest', 'forms', 'genre', 'normally', 'reserved', 'gangsters', 'private', 'dicks', 'musicians', 'music', 'are', 'given', 'sinister', 'light', 'most', 'sets', 'are', 'devoid', 'significant', 'illumination', 'everything', 'coming', 'one', 'two', 'on-set', 'lamps', 'spots', 'actors', 'wander', 'images', 'are', 'texture', 'high-contrast', 'rim', 'lighting', 'low', 'key', 'veteran', 'cinematographer', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'masterpiece', 'negative', 'space', 'visual', 'composition', 'mise-en-scene', 'are', 'remarkably', 'efficient.The', 'editing', 'also', 'spectacular', 'moving', 'invisible', 'style', 'Hollywood', 'narrative', 'pretty', 'wild', 'montages', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'crash', '28', 'where', 'cuts', 'really', 'come', 'play', 'next-to-last', 'scene', 'where', 'waves', 'roll', 'last', 'walk', 'beach', 'guy', 'dog', 'music', 'almost', 'wall', 'wall', 'screen-performances', 'are', 'masterfully', 'employed', 'emotional', 'devices', 'leading', 'Garfield', 'Crawford', 'final', 'performance.Yeah', 'know', 'just', 'melodrama', 'think', 'Crawford', 'Co.', 'genuinely', 'believed', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'maybe', 'even', 'Levant', 'believed', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'badly', 'handled', 'Joan', 'drunk', 'night', 'club', 'just', 'cute', 'Garfield', 'father', 'obsession', 'statistics', 'actually', 'move', 'quite', 'well', 'end', ""'ve"", 'made', 'remarkably', 'affecting', 'film.And', 'how', 'end', 'real', 'life', 'Joan', 'got', 'Oscar', 'lived', 'work', 'Spielberg', 'Garfield', 'survived', 'McCarthy', 'hearings', 'naming', 'names', 'was', 'dead', 'year', 'later', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'did', 'night-time', 'talk-show', 'live', 'TV', 'where', 'immobilized', 'despair', 'depression', 'addiction', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'collapsed', 'keyboard', 'mid-performance']",Humoresque VHS
280012,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,6301968964,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[4, 5]","That's violinist Paul Boray's working-class mother's opinion about the affair her son is having with the older and unhappily married socialite Helen Wright (Joan Crawford). What's Helen's problem? Does she attach herself to male artists like Paul because she believes that, as a woman, she's incapable achieving anything creative on her own? Crawford's character wears clothing with enormous shoulder pads--large and out-of-date even by the fashion standards of the time (Gina, the virtuous girl that Paul dumps, dresses in clothing that already looks ahead to Dior's New Look). Helen's big-shouldered outfits give her a masculine look that suggests she longs for the life of fame and achievement that Paul attains (with her financial and emotional support, to her credit). What's stopping her? She's hooked on her husband's money and she's an alcoholic (another black mark against her in Paul's mother's book). Crawford gives a great, scenery-chewing performance. Sure she's a mess, but she's a lot more interesting than anyone else in the film. John Garfield is attractive as Paul Boray and he's a strong actor, but he's left playing second fiddle (excuse the pun) to Crawford's non-stop histrionics. Oscar Levant plays his usual role as the wisecracking sidekick.Humoresque has a left-wing political component to it that's easy for us to miss today. Paul argues with his mother beneath a large portrait of FDR. Gina, also a musician, volunteers to work with a youth orchestra composed of children of the poor. Helen could use her money and influence to genuinely help young artists and do real good in the world--but she's too self-involved to to see beyond her own needs. ""Here's to the time where we were all little girls, and no one asked us to marry!"" Helen says bitterly to herself as she pours herself yet another drink. And she's not the only woman who's stuck. Helen, Paul's mother and Gina all face a problematic future as women in a postwar America that marginalizes them.",5,"""There's Something Wrong with Women Like Her!""",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1985,"['violinist', 'Paul', 'Boray', 'working-class', 'mother', 'opinion', 'affair', 'son', 'having', 'older', 'unhappily', 'married', 'socialite', 'Helen', 'Wright', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'What', 'Helen', 'problem', 'attach', 'male', 'artists', 'Paul', 'that', 'woman', 'incapable', 'achieving', 'anything', 'creative', 'own', 'Crawford', 'character', 'clothing', 'enormous', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'large', 'out-of-date', 'even', 'fashion', 'standards', 'time', 'Gina', 'virtuous', 'girl', 'Paul', 'dresses', 'clothing', 'already', 'ahead', 'Dior', 'New', 'Look', 'Helen', 'big-shouldered', 'outfits', 'give', 'masculine', 'look', 'life', 'fame', 'achievement', 'Paul', 'financial', 'emotional', 'support', 'credit', 'What', 'stopping', 'hooked', 'husband', 'money', 'alcoholic', 'black', 'mark', 'Paul', 'mother', 'book', 'Crawford', 'great', 'scenery-chewing', 'performance', 'Sure', 'mess', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'John', 'Garfield', 'attractive', 'Paul', 'Boray', 'strong', 'actor', 'left', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'pun', 'Crawford', 'non-stop', 'histrionics', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'usual', 'role', 'wisecracking', 'sidekick.Humoresque', 'left-wing', 'political', 'component', 'easy', 'miss', 'today', 'Paul', 'mother', 'beneath', 'large', 'portrait', 'FDR', 'Gina', 'also', 'musician', 'volunteers', 'work', 'youth', 'orchestra', 'composed', 'children', 'poor', 'Helen', 'could', 'use', 'money', 'influence', 'genuinely', 'help', 'young', 'artists', 'do', 'real', 'good', 'world', 'too', 'self-involved', 'see', 'own', 'needs', 'Here', 'time', 'where', 'were', 'little', 'girls', 'one', 'asked', 'marry', 'Helen', 'bitterly', 'yet', 'drink', 'not', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'stuck', 'Helen', 'Paul', 'mother', 'Gina', 'face', 'problematic', 'future', 'women', 'postwar', 'America']",Humoresque VHS

But for the life of me, I can not understand what all the fuss is about this sappy old melodramatic yarn. To start with the plot is about as unique as a three-horned unicorn...Boy from the wrong side of the tracks falls in love with a sophisticated upper-class society dame. He uses her to climb to the top of the ladder of his dreams and once he gets there, they both realize they have about as much in common as Abbott & Godzilla.Really, is it me or doesn't it seem that this dime store romance plays on for a good two plus hours until you'd swear it takes up the better part of a whole day? The first half holds up pretty well...John Garfield struggling to raise above his grocery store humble beginnings, steadfastly clinging to his dream of becomming a concert violinist...Then his big break comes in the form of the wealthly society patron, Joan Crawford. The two engage in a verbal game of callous one-up-manship until she finally falls head over heels in love with him. She bestows him with lavish gifts and introduces him to the most influential people. She guides his fledgling career until he becomes the toast of the classical music world. But is  our boy grateful and dutiful to his patron? Of course not. For his one true love is his art. And like all true artists he cares nothing for fortune and fame, and less for the woman who made it all possible.But wait, is it too late for him to redeem himself? Can he mend his ways and finally find true love and happiness in his benevolent benifactor? And can Joan Crawford, who has given up everything, her husband, her pride, even the bottle hold out long enough to fianlly have her man? Well I won't give anything away. All I can say is the final twenty minutes is so transparent, so predictable, that even Inspector Clouseau would know how it all ends. Watching the closing sequence of John Garfield performing his violin concerto, while Joan Crawford drowns her sorrow in a barrel full of booze is just too agonizing for me.On a brighter note, the acting is top notch for these two bonified Hollywood legends. Even the supporting cast, Oscar Levant, Joan Chandler and J. Carrol Naish all contribute stalworth performances. The scenes of Crawford's fabulous Fifth Ave apartment are most elegant.

My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, ""okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!"" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her ""sorrow and pain""! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad. I am sure die hard Joan and John fans will always love this film, but all others should be able to see it for what it really is.",1,A film that is TORTURE to watch!,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2305,"['was', 'expecting', 'bit', 'more', 'movie', 'guess', 'had', 'really', 'thought', 'anything', 'starring', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'point', 'life', 'always', 'rebellious/troubled/angry', 'John', 'Garfield', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'risen', 'what', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'dislikes', 'music', 'often', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'very', 'annoying', 'Had', 'continually', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'when', 'film', 'went', 'musical', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'often', 'Joan', 'character', 'well', 'was', 'middle', 'aged', 'married', 'downing', 'glass', 'glass', 'alcoholic', 'beverages', 'constantly', 'chain', 'smoker', 'decent', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'sort', 'woman', 'Well', 'John', 'Garfield', 'was', ""n't"", 'decent', 'man', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'John', 'Garfield', 'role', 'liked', 'always', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'angry', 'rebellious', 'centered', 'going', 'life', 'wrong', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Joan', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'ultimately', 'point', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'uncomprehendable', 'romances', 'where', 'seeminly', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'speak', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'end', 'Joan', 'was', 'just', 'top', 'drama', 'queen', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'kept', 'saying', 'okay', 'Joan', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'final', 'swim', 'please', 'just', 'get', 'already', 'can', 'be', 'finished', 'boring', 'aggravating', 'movie', 'had', 'walk', 'least', '2', 'miles', 'down', 'beach', 'evening', 'gown', 'high', 'heels', 'weep', 'weep', 'make', 'clutch', 'hair', 'despair', 'went', 'loud', 'music', 'playing', 'out', 'sorrow', 'pain', 'What', 'relief', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'are', 'films', 'leave', 'feeling', 'very', 'upset', 'agitated', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'What', 'helped', 'get', 'was', 'read', 'great', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'were', 'so', 'funny', 'were', 'so', 'true', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'Laughter', 'indeed', 'great', 'healer', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'cynical', 'piano', 'player', 'friend', 'constant', 'stream', 'one', 'liners', 'Cynical', 'humor', ""n't"", 'humor', ""n't"", 'funny', 'pathetic', 'sad', 'am', 'sure', 'die', 'hard', 'Joan', 'John', 'fans', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'film', 'others', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'really']",Humoresque VHS

In ""Humoresque"" Crawford falls in love with a much younger violinist played beautifully by John Garfield. This was the first movie in which Crawford would play a character in love with a younger man. The chemistry between Joan and Garfield is evident as their characters struggle with different personal demons: Joan's character suffers from a bout with alcoholism and Garfield's character deals with issues from his boyhood. In the flashback scenes Garfield's character is played by a very young Robert Blake (shown in the credits as Bobby Blake) known as TV's ""Barretta"" and in the 2000's for his very public personal problems.""Humoresque"" was well-received by the critics and the public loved it.

In looking the other day for Garfield movies, this title 'Humoresque' popped up. I had not heard of this before even though I am a Garfield fan and decided to buy it to add to my growing collection.Well, what can I say? The story is a classic American story of the little guy from the neighbourhood made good, which is quite typical of some of Garfield films mirroring his own real life. In some cases Garfield's movies were about the little guy from the neighbourhood made good, or in the case of 'Force of Evil' and 'He Ran All the Way' the little guy from the neighbourhood made bad. Anyway Humoresque is also a love story, basically unrequited love between two people from different walks of life, and at almost two hours the film explores all sorts of themes regarding love and unhappy marriages and so on. Garfield is the brilliant but erratic genius from the neighbourhood and Crawford is the high-society lady with a drink problem in an unhappy marriage.
