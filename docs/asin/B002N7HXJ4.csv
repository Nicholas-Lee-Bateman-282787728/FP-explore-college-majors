Its easy to empathize with a man who loses his daughter at the hands of a bunch of perverts and creeps, and who wants to punish them for what they did.  I felt the movie flowed along quite well, keeping me entertained and interested throughout.  The actors did their job and seamlessly blended out of sight, replaced by the characters they were portraying.  The violence may turn off some viewers, but it isn't gratuitous violence, since its understandable given the story.  A well done gritty and bloody tale about a father who is shattered by his daughter's death and reacts in the only way he can think of - to go after anyone related to what happened to her.",4,Horseman:  worth watching,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,803,"['qualities', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'subjective', 'realize', 'think', 'Horseman', 'par.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'good', 'easy', 'empathize', 'man', 'who', 'daughter', 'hands', 'bunch', 'perverts', 'creeps', 'who', 'punish', 'what', 'did', 'felt', 'movie', 'flowed', 'quite', 'well', 'keeping', 'entertained', 'interested', 'actors', 'did', 'job', 'seamlessly', 'blended', 'sight', 'replaced', 'characters', 'were', 'portraying', 'violence', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'understandable', 'given', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'gritty', 'bloody', 'tale', 'father', 'who', 'shattered', 'daughter', 'death', 'reacts', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'go', 'anyone', 'related', 'what', 'happened']","Horseman, the anglais"
1279573,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002N7HXJ4,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","This was a very well done movie of one man's attempt to get revenge for a wrong committed to his daughter. I've seen other reviews that compare this movie to Taken (Liam Neeson), but that is not the best comparison. Taken was about one man's ability to completely disengage emotionally and active his training, all to lethal efficiency. This movie, in contrast, focuses much more on the man/father's emotional state and how that emotional state drives him to take and/or not take action. It definitely is a revenge film, and the father gradually deals with each person involved with the wrong. Each scene of ""revenge"" is very well done and certainly with intense action (but stopping short of showing each gruesome element on the scene), but this is not the cold, efficient killer of Taken. This is a man completely devastated by his daughter's death who desperately looks for a cathartic release with each swing of his crowbar that continues to elude him.Additional points of consideration - this is not a light hearted movie - it is dark, somewhat noir-ish at times, and definitely not an uplifter as the father's anguish seethes off the screen. This is by no means to imply the film was not enjoyable - it was very much - just note the emotional character of the film and make sure you're in the mood for this kind of film. Also, its set in Australia, which is a fun break from the standard American fare.Overall - very highly recommended.",4,"Very well done, but note the caveats",1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,1442,"['was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'one', 'man', 'attempt', 'get', 'revenge', 'wrong', 'committed', 'daughter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'reviews', 'compare', 'movie', 'Taken', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'not', 'best', 'comparison', 'Taken', 'was', 'one', 'man', 'ability', 'completely', 'disengage', 'emotionally', 'active', 'training', 'lethal', 'efficiency', 'movie', 'contrast', 'much', 'more', 'man/father', 'emotional', 'state', 'how', 'emotional', 'state', 'drives', 'take', 'and/or', 'not', 'take', 'action', 'definitely', 'revenge', 'film', 'father', 'gradually', 'person', 'involved', 'wrong', 'scene', 'revenge', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'intense', 'action', 'stopping', 'short', 'showing', 'gruesome', 'element', 'scene', 'not', 'cold', 'efficient', 'killer', 'Taken', 'man', 'completely', 'devastated', 'daughter', 'death', 'who', 'desperately', 'cathartic', 'release', 'swing', 'crowbar', 'elude', 'him.Additional', 'points', 'consideration', 'not', 'light', 'hearted', 'movie', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'noir-ish', 'times', 'definitely', 'not', 'uplifter', 'father', 'anguish', 'seethes', 'screen', 'means', 'imply', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'note', 'emotional', 'character', 'film', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'mood', 'kind', 'film', 'Also', 'set', 'Australia', 'fun', 'break', 'standard', 'American', 'fare.Overall', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']","Horseman, the anglais"

1279580,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B002N7HXJ4,Carl Manes,"[12, 12]","Christian suffers the worst fate that any father could possibly imagine when the police inform him that his daughter has been found suffocated to death after being physically abused and pumped full of drugs. After receiving an anonymous package in the mail, Christian learns that his daughter had fallen into an underground pornography ring, and he immediately sets off to find his daughter's killers and make them pay! Steven Kastrissios' breakthrough Independent feature THE HORSEMAN is an abrasive thriller that follows one man's violent and bloody quest for revenge. Unlike so many other antiheroes, Christian is neither sly, stealthy, or self-assured. He frequently loses his composure and breaks down into quivering fits of rage, madness, and sorrow as he interrogates each of the men that he feels are responsible for his daughter's death. Peter Marshall is intimidating in the role, with a fiery intensity that explodes on screen. The young hitchhiker, Alice, that he picks up on the road serves as the only remaining link to his humanity, a surrogate daughter for him to protect in place of his own. Although the action beats can become repetitive as Christian uses the same methods of torture to extract information from his victims, the raw violence and gritty gore are painfully realistic. Kastrissios constantly forces the audience to question the morality behind Christian's vigilante justice, especially when each of the men involved in the sex tape claim that his daughter was already on drugs when she arrived and that she was a willing participant at all times. Blinded by rage, Christian willfully ignores the fact that his daughter may have been responsible for her own asphyxiation.

For every great revenge film (""Last House on the Left"", ""Kill Bill"") there are at least ten that are silly, schlocky, or exploitive.""The Horseman"" doesn't aim to reinvent the revenge film drama, but elevate it. The very simple plot involves a father's quest to punish the men involved with a porn shoot that his troubled daughter was involved in, which either directly or indirectly led to her death. The father (Christian) visits each member of the seedy network of porn purveyors, ruthlessly determined to use any means necessary (violence, torture, threats) to find out who was directly involved, and punish them.Peter Marshall gives a tour-de-force performance as Christian (the father) that makes the film succeed. When confronting the men who he believes were responsible for his daughter's death, he is merciless, mechanical, and unapologetically violent. But the actor's eyes reveal the character's truth - that Christian is a man in so much pain, that numbness and violence are his only choices. It's clear that Christian's anger, hatred, and thirst for vengeance are also his punishment to himself for failing his daughter as a father and protector. Underneath the gritty violence, Marshall shows the character's broken heart.Although the bloody, ugly, violent business of revenge make up most of the film, a subplot where Christian befriends a troubled runaway add to Christian's humanity. And when his plot for revenge endangers the girl in the film's final act, it gives Christian's violent quest an urgency and opportunity for redemption.Bravo.",4,Broken heart,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,1676,"['revenge', 'film', 'genre', 'heavily', 'populated', 'yet', 'few', 'members', 'ever', 'really', 'transcend', 'greatness', 'great', 'revenge', 'film', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'are', 'least', 'ten', 'are', 'silly', 'schlocky', 'exploitive', 'Horseman', ""n't"", 'aim', 'reinvent', 'revenge', 'film', 'drama', 'elevate', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'father', 'quest', 'punish', 'men', 'involved', 'porn', 'shoot', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'was', 'involved', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'led', 'death', 'father', 'Christian', 'member', 'seedy', 'network', 'porn', 'purveyors', 'ruthlessly', 'determined', 'use', 'means', 'necessary', 'violence', 'torture', 'threats', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'directly', 'involved', 'punish', 'them.Peter', 'Marshall', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Christian', 'father', 'film', 'succeed', 'When', 'confronting', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'daughter', 'death', 'merciless', 'mechanical', 'unapologetically', 'violent', 'actor', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'character', 'truth', 'Christian', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'numbness', 'violence', 'are', 'only', 'choices', 'clear', 'Christian', 'anger', 'hatred', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'are', 'also', 'punishment', 'failing', 'daughter', 'father', 'protector', 'gritty', 'violence', 'Marshall', 'character', 'broken', 'bloody', 'ugly', 'violent', 'business', 'revenge', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'subplot', 'where', 'Christian', 'troubled', 'runaway', 'add', 'Christian', 'humanity', 'when', 'plot', 'revenge', 'endangers', 'girl', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'Christian', 'violent', 'quest', 'urgency', 'opportunity', 'redemption.Bravo']","Horseman, the anglais"

Though I see that, the lesser aspects of the movie overshadowed any real power it could have delivered.Here's the scoop. A young girl makes a porno movie with some guys she doesn't know. They give her some heroin to make her more amenable to the action. She is later found dead of an overdose. Dad goes out to exact revenge on everyone who had anything to do with the making of the film.This movie fails at the outset. Dad is going to commit murder in his daughter's name for these unspeakable acts. I'm asking myself why she's doing this in the first place? She drinks, does drugs and makes porno movies. Where was he when she was being raised? Almost all his victims tell him (as they're experiencing grievous bodily harm) ""she came to us. We didn't force her into this."" As he does practice self mutilation we know he feels some degree of remorse, but evidently not much. And his helping the young, pregnant runaway girl is supposed to show him trying to make up for his bad parenting and it's a way too pat aspect of the script.I found this all very brutish and clumsy. Tracking down those involved in the project was routine. There was nothing at all clever about it. The manner of killings was not clever either. Most of them he just beats to death. And the climax where they get the jump on him, and he has to try and turn the tables, is just plain lazy.This is a revenge movie plain and simple, but the heart of it is questionable so the viewer isn't squarely on his side and that is necessary in a revenge movie. The acting is good enough and the production values are good enough.

Our main character isn't a Kung Fu, special ops, commando type guy but just your average Joe who is at first emotionally numb towards his daughter's recent death. As the movie goes on his anger and rage grows and eventually he gets revenge not with choreographed action sequences and Hollywood special effects but with an honest and graphic caveman-like violence. If anything the violence inflicted is very human and honest and up close. It connects you with the hero because in most scenes he is fighting not just for revenge but for his own life as he gets mixed up with the wrong people connected to the original people he is seeking. This is where the movie earns every star.Very good stuff.

1279644,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B002N7HXJ4,The Jaundiced Eye,"[5, 5]","Like other reviewers, I had no idea what to expect from this Australian production, but I did assume that it would follow the routine course of the countless revenge tales that preceded it. Boy, was I wrong. Not since watching The Exorcist many years ago have I been so unprepared for a movie. In fact, comparing it to any previous revenge flick is like comparing Gone With the Wind to a Looney Tunes Cartoon....it is absolutely riveting, thoroughly engaging, well-scripted, superbly acted, and not easily forgotten.The storyline is simple and already described by many other reviewers; it involves a physically unimposing father avenging the death of his teenage daughter at the hands of porn merchants, or so he assumes. What separates this production from previous ones is that it explores the gray area of responsibility for her death, between the father who tortures himself (legitimately) for his poor parenting, the girl herself for making bad decisions, and the group of men involved in her demise. Most of these men present their side of the issue, and it should be noted that some of them present rather compelling cases. They are not all the drooling, psychotic fiends normally encountered in such productions, but characters which are generally complex, realistic, and guilty to varying degrees.The father has no superhuman abilities and is always in great jeopardy while exacting his revenge. You are never really sure if he's going to achieve his goal or end up sharing his daughter's fate. This adds greatly to the suspense. He is not Liam Neeson or Charles Bronson, but just a common guy whose guilt makes him relatively immune to pain and whose rage makes him very, very tough. The fight scenes are superbly choreographed, and appear to be both spontaneous and absolutely realistic....the best I have ever seen. There is no silly Kung Fu or predictable outcome, just the sheer, scary violence that occurs in battles to the death.

I love hard-boiled revenge movies like ""Get Carter"" (the original) and ""Rolling Thunder"" so I was hoping this movie would be awesome and badass like those great movies.  Unfortunately, it is SO POORLY made it's nearly unwatchable.  The production values are the WORST.  It looks like it was made by a couple of high school kids using their parents' super cheap video camera.  The movie is grainy and every scene is cast in an ugly greenish tint.  The cinematography is atrociously bad.  Too many close ups, bad angles and weird ""choppy-motion"" shots that are popular these days with digital filmmakers but look stupid and horrible in action scenes (though the filmmakers probably think they're being ""arty"" and ""cool"").  They're not.  The story (what there is of one) is just a series of torture, interrogation and fight scenes as the father of a junkie daughter (who was in a porn film) goes around and finds the makers of the porn film and tortures, interrogates, fights and/or kills them.  Basically it's a rip-off of the much better 70's film ""Hardcore"" starring George C. Scott.  So if you're in the mood for a revenge flick, track down ""Hardcore"" or, better yet, ""Rolling Thunder"" starring William Devane.  Just stay far, far way from ""The Horseman.""
