900926,A30638B9S2GOM8,B00094ARGY,apples2apples,"[0, 0]","This is a really cute series - one of those shows you just never forget it's so different.In season one Georgia meets with an untimely death, and becomes a reaper. She's in denial about her death, and wants no part of her new job. She's grieveing the loss of her family, as they're also grieving for her - all moving away from each other; not helping or comforting each other - esp. the young daughter, Reggie.In season 2 everything seems richer, livelier, more evolved. The reapers seem more like a family than just a group of mismatched souls. Georgia seems more settled and adjusted in her new life, while still watching over her family - esp her little sister Reggie. She comes to realize how much Reggie meant to her. The upheaval for the family is more settled in season 2 as well. The parents finally part company. The mother, while still somewhat distant, comes around a bit, and seems to be a better parent to Reggie - who, over time, reluctantly adjusts to her ""new"" improved mother.Review from season 1:The series, Dead Like Me, is kind of a dark comedy. The series is about a young woman, 18 year old Georgia, who's met with an untimely death when a toilet seat comes crashing to earth from the space station MIR. It's a funny scene - not just because she's hit by a toilet seat which has burst into flames because it's falling from space, but because in an ironic twist Georgia (George) is at lunch on her first day of work, looks up, and sees the toilet seat heading straight for her! At first she doesn't seem to understand she's dead and is in great denial. George finds herself stuck between life and death, appointed to be a reaper - a job she wants no part of.As a reaper George is still ""in the flesh"", but no longer appears as George to anyone who knew her before. She ""lives"" a somewhat normal ""life"" in that she has a job working in an office, but also meets with the other reapers every day and is given her assignment - who she has to reap that day and at what time. When the reapers touch the intended person, they die, and go on to ... where ever it is they go when they die! On occasion one of the reapers is late, or misses their appointment - which has various unfortunate consequences. The reapers are always trying to beat the gravelings to the reap. Gravelings are nasty creatures - about the only thing that would really make this series unacceptable for kids who are scared by such things.George never seems to get over the fact that she's died, and keeps going back to check up on/spy on/reminisce about her family - something reapers are forbidden to do. There are some pretty funny results of her doing this, especially with her mother - who percieves her as some kind of stalker after she runs into George more than once lurking around their house. There are also some pretty sad moments when it comes to her younger sister, Reggie - who also can't seem to get over Geogia's death. After George's death Reggie rebels by stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school, and hanging them from a tree in a ""secret place"". It's funny in a ironic way.George's mother, played by Cynthia Stevenson, is an uptight, cold character even before George's death, but afterward takes out her grief on her husband and Reggie. Reggie grows up to be a pretty girl, but she's always kind of alienated from her peers.Minor characters: In her new ""life"", other than being a reaper, George is employed in an office where her boss, Deloris Herbig, is an odd, motherly character. At home Deloris has her own reality show of sorts - which George finds out about when she has to move in with Deloris and finds herself broadcast on the internet! Deloris has an elderly cat, Murray - who's love of Deloris' life.Main Characters: The ""head reaper"" is played by Manny Pantankin (Rube) - who is ideal in the part. I don't think there's anyone else who could play the part so well - as we later find out in the movie - which was a huge disappointment to my husband and myself. The other reapers are played by Jasmine Guy (Roxy) who is wonderful as a hard-nosed meter maid. Laura Harris (Daisy Adair) who is beautiful and stuck up. She was an actress in her day who just can't give up on the fact that she'll never act again. To Daisy all the afterlife is a stage. Callum Blue (Mason) a British con man, who's always looking for a con, and is too good looking even for himself - in his opinion! And Rebecca Gayheart (Betty) a former dancer who's character is happy and optimistic.I originally got the 1st season of ""Dead Like Me"" as a present for our oldest daughter, but she never watched them, so my husband and I ""borrowed"" them. Once we started watching we had to see them all! After watching the first 2 seasons my husband and I searched and were thrilled to find the 3rd season, but then were so disappointed when we found the series ended after 3 seasons.This is a must see

Especially if you don't mind laughing around the topic of death, which actually is a great way to deal with it.  In a nutshell, whereas the first season was about how George was getting used to being a reaper, the second season explores the other characters as well as some interesting and unique deaths.  Some of them are downright hysterical and some are incredibly touching.  This season is wonderful.If I had one complaint it would be the excessive use of the ""f"" word.  Don't get me wrong, I swear like a sailor myself, but the ""f"" word is so overused in this season as a noun, verb and adjective in every sentence it gets annoying after awhile and is a bit distracting.

900928,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B00094ARGY,AyJay,"[3, 4]","Yay!! The second (and sadly last) season of DLM finds its way onto DVD.Again, we see both this life, and the afterlife though central character George.On the dead side: George is a reaper, collecting souls of people about to die (this prevents them feeling pain and stops them getting left behind in this world). George's team also includes Mason, Daisy, and Roxy and is lead by Rube.This season we also explore the other characters in more detail; especially Rube's mortal life, and surprisingly vulnerable Mason, with the effects on him caused by his`job'.My favourite character Daisy also gives hints on her living life, especially towards the end of the series. I enjoyed having the `Bimbo Blonde' surface scratched away from this character, revealing someone we could all know.On the living side: George works for a temp agency, Happy Time, `living' under the guise of `Millie'. Some of the best comedic moments of the series take place in Happy Time. `Millie's manager Delores is just too funny, and all viewers will see a little bit of their own managers in the character.George has now adjusted to the fact that her old life is over, and decides to make the most of this one. This will include boyfriends, and mingling with her co workers at Happy Time.Also, we once again follow George's surviving family. Her parent's are divorcing, and her younger sister Reggie is entering that frightful period known as puberty. George's grandmother also appears this series.Well, is there anything negative about this fantastic series that ended far too soon?While the final episode `Haunted' is satisfying, and ties up the series nicely, there are still a few loose ends that niggled me. In `Haunted', Crystal (the receptionist at Happy Time) is searching for `Georgia Lass' on the computer. Has she learnt George/Millie's secret? Reggie knows George is still around, but has she also grasped the reaper angle. I'm quite sure she has, but it would have been nice to have this voiced. Finally, flashbacks to Rube's mortal life leave more burning questions, which I won't mention here as I don't want to spoil anything.Send In The ClownThe LedgerGhost StoryThe Shallow EndHurryIn EscrowRites Of PassageThe Escape ArtistBe Still My HeartDeath DefyingAshes To AshesForget Me NotLast CallAlwaysHauntedBonus materialDead Like Me Again: FeaturettePutting Life Into Death: FeaturetteDeleted ScenesPhoto Gallery",5,The best (and sadly last) season,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,2400,"['Yay', 'second', 'sadly', 'last', 'season', 'DLM', 'way', 'DVD.Again', 'see', 'life', 'afterlife', 'central', 'character', 'George.On', 'dead', 'side', 'George', 'reaper', 'collecting', 'souls', 'people', 'die', 'feeling', 'pain', 'stops', 'getting', 'left', 'world', 'George', 'team', 'also', 'Mason', 'Daisy', 'Roxy', 'lead', 'Rube.This', 'season', 'also', 'explore', 'other', 'characters', 'more', 'detail', 'especially', 'Rube', 'mortal', 'life', 'surprisingly', 'vulnerable', 'Mason', 'effects', 'caused', ""job'.My"", 'favourite', 'character', 'Daisy', 'also', 'hints', 'living', 'life', 'especially', 'end', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'Bimbo', 'Blonde', 'surface', 'scratched', 'away', 'character', 'revealing', 'someone', 'could', 'know.On', 'living', 'side', 'George', 'temp', 'agency', 'Happy', 'Time', 'living', 'guise', 'Millie', 'best', 'comedic', 'moments', 'series', 'take', 'place', 'Happy', 'Time', 'Millie', 'manager', 'Delores', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'own', 'managers', 'character.George', 'now', 'adjusted', 'fact', 'old', 'life', 'make', 'most', 'one', 'will', 'include', 'boyfriends', 'mingling', 'co', 'workers', 'Happy', 'Time.Also', 'once', 'again', 'follow', 'George', 'surviving', 'family', 'parent', 'are', 'divorcing', 'younger', 'sister', 'Reggie', 'entering', 'frightful', 'period', 'known', 'puberty', 'George', 'grandmother', 'also', 'series.Well', 'there', 'anything', 'negative', 'fantastic', 'series', 'ended', 'far', 'too', 'soon', 'final', 'episode', 'Haunted', 'satisfying', 'up', 'series', 'nicely', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'niggled', 'Haunted', 'Crystal', 'receptionist', 'Happy', 'Time', 'searching', 'Georgia', 'Lass', 'computer', 'Has', 'learnt', 'George/Millie', 'secret', 'Reggie', 'George', 'still', 'around', 'also', 'grasped', 'reaper', 'angle', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'voiced', 'Finally', 'flashbacks', 'Rube', 'mortal', 'life', 'leave', 'more', 'burning', 'questions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything.Send', 'ClownThe', 'LedgerGhost', 'StoryThe', 'Shallow', 'EndHurryIn', 'EscrowRites', 'PassageThe', 'Escape', 'ArtistBe', 'Still', 'My', 'HeartDeath', 'DefyingAshes', 'AshesForget', 'Me', 'NotLast', 'CallAlwaysHauntedBonus', 'materialDead', 'Me', 'Again', 'FeaturettePutting', 'Life', 'Into', 'Death', 'FeaturetteDeleted', 'ScenesPhoto', 'Gallery']",Dead Like Me - The Complete Second Season

But those that can are so spectacular that they burn brightest before being snuffed out. Such is the case with Showtime's DEAD LIKE ME.After two short but extremely sweet seasons, DLM was given the axe for unknown reasons.This second season is just as fantastic as the first, giving us more laughs, more thought-provoking character analysis, and more gut-wrenching and tear-jerking episodes.If you're not familiar with the premise of the series, it goes something like this:Eighteen-year-old Georgia (""George"") Lass, on her first day of work, is killed by a toilet seat that blasts into Earth's atmosphere from the disintegrating Mir space station. After the explosion, she's recruited into reaperhood by Mandy Patinkin (Rube). And with Rube comes a clutch of other reapers, all with attitudes, personal baggage, and problems of their own. Most notable among them is Mason (played perfectly by Callum Blue), an alcoholic, drug-using reaper who knows no boundaries. In one hilarious but ultimately sad episode during this season, Mason has to reap the father of a young girl during the girl's birthday party. And Mason has to dress up as a clown to get into the party. But Mason is anything but a clown and, in fact, hates them. So when he's asked to make balloon animals for the children, he produces some very phallic looking items, much to the chagrin of the parents at the party. And then, after he successfully reaps the girl's father, he heads outside to rip off his clown nose and start drinking heavily from a whiskey bottle.We also get to see Georgia lose her virginity and grow up a bit (even though she's still dead). And we get to witness how Gravelings are made (the beastie little creatures that cause all the bad accidents).But those revelations pale in comparison to what happens to Rube. In one of the most heartbreaking episodes, Rube discovers that his one and only daughter is still alive, and is about to die. If you watch this and it doesn't choke you up, I fear that you're dead!It is sad to think that there will be no further exploration of these amazing characters' lives. I will certainly miss not learning what happens to George as she grows psychologically and emotionally. I will miss not knowing if Reggie, George's younger sister, blossoms into a normal young lady.

MGM and the show's creator, Bryan Fuller, butted heads over creative differences and this led to his departure during the first season. The show survived with very little disruption for a strong second season and then was promptly canceled by the studio. Dead Like Me took a smart, clever and very entertaining look at death that was free of the pretension that plagues a show like Six Feet Under. It is much more playful in tone, much like the also defunct Wonderfalls.Dead Like Me treats reaping as a job just like any other except for the crucial difference that these characters are harvesting peoples' souls. There is a playful, whimsical side to the show that is largely a part of its appeal. In the episode, ""Send in the Clown,"" there is a spot-on parody of Hill Street Blues, right down to the music, a famous line of dialogue and so on but for parking enforcement. Six Feet Under this ain't - unless it merged with Harold and Maude. It's frustrating when such an obviously brilliant show is cut down before it really is allowed to reach its full potential.All of the extras are located on the fourth DVD. ""Dead Like Me...Again"" is an 11-minute featurette about the show. The cast talk about their characters and gush about working on the show. Sadly, the irony is that everyone talks as if another season is in the works when we know that the show has been cancelled.""Putting Life Into Death"" takes a look at how the special effects technicians bring the CGI Gravelings to life and how they pulled off five other effects, such as souls passing through live beings and how the death ripple, when a reaper touches someone before they die, is achieved.Also included are nine deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes that are not put into context, so, at times, it's difficult to figure out which episode they come from.Finally, there is a photo gallery featuring some stills from the show.",4,Six Feet Under meets Harold and Maude,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1961,"['Dead', 'Me', 'yet', 'example', 'TV', 'show', 'cut', 'down', 'prime', 'MGM', 'show', 'creator', 'Bryan', 'Fuller', 'butted', 'heads', 'creative', 'differences', 'led', 'departure', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'survived', 'very', 'little', 'disruption', 'strong', 'second', 'season', 'then', 'was', 'promptly', 'canceled', 'studio', 'Dead', 'Me', 'took', 'smart', 'clever', 'very', 'entertaining', 'look', 'death', 'was', 'free', 'pretension', 'show', 'Six', 'Feet', 'much', 'more', 'playful', 'tone', 'much', 'also', 'defunct', 'Wonderfalls.Dead', 'Me', 'reaping', 'job', 'just', 'other', 'crucial', 'difference', 'characters', 'are', 'harvesting', 'peoples', 'souls', 'playful', 'whimsical', 'side', 'show', 'largely', 'part', 'appeal', 'episode', 'Send', 'Clown', 'spot-on', 'parody', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'right', 'down', 'music', 'famous', 'line', 'dialogue', 'so', 'parking', 'enforcement', 'Six', 'Feet', 'ai', ""n't"", 'merged', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'frustrating', 'when', 'such', 'obviously', 'brilliant', 'show', 'cut', 'down', 'really', 'allowed', 'reach', 'full', 'potential.All', 'extras', 'are', 'located', 'fourth', 'DVD', 'Dead', 'Me', 'Again', '11-minute', 'featurette', 'show', 'cast', 'talk', 'characters', 'gush', 'working', 'show', 'Sadly', 'irony', 'everyone', 'talks', 'season', 'works', 'when', 'know', 'show', 'been', 'cancelled', 'Putting', 'Life', 'Into', 'Death', 'look', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'technicians', 'bring', 'CGI', 'Gravelings', 'life', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'five', 'other', 'effects', 'such', 'souls', 'passing', 'live', 'beings', 'how', 'death', 'ripple', 'when', 'reaper', 'someone', 'die', 'achieved.Also', 'included', 'are', 'nine', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'totaling', '11', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'put', 'context', 'so', 'times', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out', 'come', 'from.Finally', 'photo', 'gallery', 'featuring', 'stills', 'show']",Dead Like Me - The Complete Second Season

There was a lot of potential in their take on the setup and many interesting things happened, but ultimately the show doesn't stand up.

900962,AIO247KHD2O40,B00094ARGY,James N Simpson,"[4, 4]","The characters of Death Like Me took a lot of people in their prime and like those characters this show did not die after becoming old and stale but while it was still young and fresh. Its abrupt cancelling took not only fans but cast and crew by surprise as well (as is evident by Jasmine Guy comments in the Dead Like Me Again special feature who was looking forward to playing Roxy for a long time to come).  I guess the only positive thing we can take from the axing is that it parralleled what the show was about, the unexpected waking up and finding that something you love and looked forward to the company of is abruptly no longer with us and we will never see them again and wish we'd learnt a little bit more about them while they were still alive.The second season of Dead Like Me is funnier than the first, the first season although great had to in order to set the series in motion to deal with a lot of issues with George coming to grips the whole reaper situation and aspects such as finding her place in employment at Happy Time as well. Also her family members had to come to terms with her being gone and the inevitable tension and strains amongst them while doing so.  There's still some of this in season two but with the second season the other reaper characters get to be explored in greater depth, in fact the show became more about the reaper family as a whole, rather than a show about George. This allowed a lot of funny moments such as Mason having to reap a naked old man who wouldn't leave until his funeral. Heavy drama moments as well such as Daisy dating a domestic violence control freak, Rube letting viewers in on the existence of his daughter and much more.  George scenes at Happy Times were a lot funnier with her being promoted to interview clients for employers (who are just hilarious applicants) and giving an office thief his comeuppance. We also get to see the Gravelings in a lot more detail with this second season (and you can see how they and other special effects such as the death ripple were created in the special features).It is a shame this show was axed, it a very good and unique TV program.  Do yourself a favour and get a copy of this and the first season while they are still reasonably priced.  There is a Dead Like Me movie coming out with Ellen Muth and some of the reaper actors from this series which may give us fans some closure but although we can hope, I've never seen a series resurrected after a few years off air.

It is quite disheartening to see such an intelligent funny dark comedy cancelled and replaced by more of the usual ""rubbish"" that the networks grind out.The second season of ""Dead Like Me"" wasn't as strong as the first, but it was pretty close, still very engaging and better than most other television shows on cable and the networks. The main problem with season 2 is that it sets up many interesting questions that were meant to be answered in future seasons, but we'll never get those answers because someone at Showtime decided to kill its best show. In this season we really saw the character of ""George"" grow up into adult, something she couldn't do while alive. The entire cast was excellent, and the interaction of the ""reapers"" among themselves and with their ""victims"" was hysterically funny. There were so many unanswered questions woven into the plots about the reapers that we will never know the answers to. The development of this mismatched group of characters was so interesting, plus the subplot of George's family gave such a deep dimension to the overall story. What will happen to Joy and Reggie? How did Rube die? What was his history? I'm sure the writers would have given us a wonderful ride, if only Showtime stuck with it. All of the extras are located on the fourth DVD. ""Dead Like Me...Again"" is an 11-minute featurette about the show. The cast talk about their characters and gush about working on the show. Sadly, the irony is that everyone talks as if another season is in the works when we know that the show has been cancelled.""Putting Life Into Death"" takes a look at how the special effects technicians bring the CGI Gravelings to life and how they pulled off five other effects, such as souls passing through live beings and how the death ripple, when a reaper touches someone before they die, is achieved.Also included are nine deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes that are not put into context, so, at times, it's difficult to figure out which episode they come from.Finally, there is a photo gallery featuring some stills from the show.

Then I saw the show in a motel during vacation and didn't really get interested in it. Later, I watched a couple reruns. It became one of most amusing series I've ever watched. Very funny and weird in a neat way.When I discovered Showtime dropped this show, it helped me remember why I dropped Showtime from my lineup. They'd do well to show less porn and more things with the clever and sweet appeal of Dead Like Me.Dead Like Me got better with each show, although it started out the first season a little slow, which it why I didn't continue watching until later. The second season was excellent. The characters were great. Too bad it's all over. I am so glad I recorded most of the series. The shows are just as delightful the second or third viewing, but what would you expect from someone who likes rewatching Men in Black I & II, Groundhog Day, Happy Texas, Demolition Man, Star Wars (IV-the first one screened), and Stargate?Maybe Showtime needs a visit from a grim reaper willing to rip the soul out of its corporate fat butt and shake it real good before slamming it back inside.

Having been a Reaper for about a year, George is starting to get into the swing of things but there is still plenty more to learn.On the job front George, as Millie, is gaining responsibilities she is not sure she wants.  On the home front her old family seems to be falling further apart.  On the Reaper front she learns that she is not alone in her feelings about her life, just a little more vocal about them.  Rube and Roz do some of the most developing in this season although Mason really has his moments.  In other words, through death we find out a lot of wisdom about life.This season is formatted a little differently than the first season.  Nudity has been added (only in a few episodes and all male) but that is very minor.  The big change is that all too often it seems that George and the other reapers on the team are more responsible for the actual deaths they deal with.  All too often it seems that if they hadn't been there then the victim would have survived.  The other big change is the gravelings.  They are far more visible this season.  We also learn a little more about them and where they come from.All in all this was a strong follow-up to the first season with a good mix of fresh ideas and old standards.

900988,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B00094ARGY,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[1, 1]","It always hurts when a show that you really enjoy gets cancelled.  However, the blow is definitely softened if the show has a good ending, and ""Dead Like Me,"" for the most part, does.  The season starts off a bit weak, but picks up a few episodes in and becomes about as good as thefirst season.  There are no episodes as utterly fantastic as the pilot, which really made the first season, but there are definitely a few standouts.  The penultimate episode, ""Always"" was especially great.This season, for me, was all about character development.  There was more attention put on multiple episode storylines that, in some cases, really paid off.  Daisy's journey from gossiping girl to devout Christian to Ray's girlfriend to an emotionally vulnerable woman was tragic and captivating to watch, and in many ways made the season for me.  All of the characters really had something going on, which gave these episodes--even the less entertaining ones--a lot more depth.  Rube goes on a journey to find someone from his past, Roxy becomes a cop, Reggie (who, in many ways, is the star of this season) deals with her parent's divorce and even more death, and Mason becomes even less capable of taking care of himself.  Mason's character arc was especially well done, as there's an absurd balance between the comedic and the tragic in his scenes.  You're not sure whether to laugh or cry at his antics.On the other hand, there were things I thought could use definite improvement.  I'm not really fond of how they handled George's character this season, because she often felt like a plot device the writers used to introduce and sum up their episodes, which is an odd way to use the series' protagonist.  Every episode starts with George musing about something random from her life and ends with her making a realization about that thing.  That's a bit too formulaic for me, especially after George's wonderful development in the first season.  I also noticed that the use of music in this season was shockingly bad, as cheery little tunes play over the scenes that were intended to be dramatic.  Rube's realization in the post office that his money wasn't sent to his daughter should and could have been chilling, but with happy music playing in the background, what do you think the scene will come off like?  Certainly not as it was intended to.All in all, the positive definitely outweighs the negative.  This was a show that I truly enjoyed, and I am happy to see that, despite it's cancellation, ""Dead Like Me"" will have life after death.  In just a few months from now, adirect-to-DVD ""Dead Like Me"" moviewill come out.  I can't wait to see these characters interacting again.

One more season would have shown whether or not it had real staying power.  But then the producers stated they would be focused primarily on another project, so that may have killed it regardless.You have to accept the premise (real grim reapers), and as the subject says, I believe it turned too dramatic, less humorous, in the second season.  More comedy would have possibly saved it, as well as maintaining production values and some of the early concepts as were shown early on when money was being spent to enhance quality.Certainly the story possibilities were endless.

She acted like not only being a reaper sucked but the actual show and storyline sucked as well. Between George, Herbig and the grandmother I was about to lose my mind. I kept literally falling asleep. I frequently rewound episodes only to realize I hadn't even missed anything because nothing really happened. I would go into a daze, fall asleep but I would still be half aware of what was going on. I found I simply wasn't missing anything at all. I too only got through about half of disc two of the second season. I only paid ten dollars for each season for a total of twenty dollars. I got ten dollars for both seasons at the pawn shop. I took the ten dollars and put it towards the 12 dollars that they wanted for season one of Millenium. I know Millenium was a dark weird and somewhat dumb show but I know I'll be able to watch it. And I am one of those types who usually cannot get rid of a tv show once I have bought it. Usually most of shows have some redeeming qualities that force me to keep them. Now I truely loved the mother of this show, but not at first. At first her complete ""bitch"" factor was simply too far off of the scale. But later she showed more humanity and she is such an attractive woman and she was also doing some great acting. And the father and daughter were both good characters. My favorite reaper was Callum Blue who was sorely underused or his character was not given the breadth it needed.All in all ""Dead Like Me"" was to me a pretty dreadful show. Sure, they employ a lot of profanity and sexual situations but it only cheapens the show. It does NOT make the show HIP. I did like the music of the show though and I like the opening sequence used for each show. That guy from the police was doing a good job.Ultimately though the show was going nowhere at all and it was moving at a snail's pace. And Ellen Muth is pretty hard on the eyes. She has nice hair and she is fit but I hate her voice and she is simply not attractive. If Muth had more talent we could easily forgive her looks but her so called acting was simply brutal. I'm so glad I got rid of this show.Sorry folks, I sincerely wanted to like this show I like dark humor. I own all of Buffy and Angel, four seasons of Supernatural, One season of Dark Shadows, both seasons of Reaper--- which is pretty poor too, and oh so much more horror and so on.

Star Ellen Muth goes so far as to hint that that a renewal of the series might be possible.  Details are still forthcoming and apart from the movie (and I'm sorry, I don't know if this is a TV, a direct-to-DVD, or theatrical release) nothing definite is known about the chances of the series being revived, but this is definitely good news.  There is some recasting.  Mandy Patinkin, unfortunately, will not be back as Rube nor will Laura Harris as Daisy.  It appears Rube's character is being replaced by a new head reaper, while a new actress will be playing Daisy.  Otherwise all the other actors will be back.Tragically, this will be the final season of DEAD LIKE ME that we will get.  Although there is currently a campaign being waged to rescue the show, these campaigns inevitably and unfortunately result in failure.  The cancellation of the show is hard to explain.  It isn't as if Showtime has such a great string of hit shows that their valuable time slots had to be freed up for new critical and popular hit series.  The fact is that DEAD LIKE ME was the finest show the network ever hosted, and its cancellation is both a blow to quality television on Showtime in particular but also television as a whole.  The past few years have seen a host of the very best shows on television get cancelled.  The list is long and contains some very impressive shows:  FIREFLY, ANGEL, WONDERFALLS, KAREN SISCO, FARSCAPE, and many others.  My lone cause for hope for the short term future of quality television is that LOST enjoyed such tremendous success in its first season that networks are currently scrambling for long story arc shows with well written, deeply interconnected scripts that typified all of the shows I mentioned above.  Maybe, just maybe, the tide has turned.  Unfortunately, not soon enough to save DEAD LIKE ME.In its first season, DEAD LIKE ME quickly established itself as one of the quirkiest and finest shows on television.  As any watcher of the show will know, Georgia Lass was a young girl who became a grim reaper after dying in a bizarre accident.  The show explored what it means to be alive through the struggles of one who was no longer alive, but who nonetheless still was confronted with the need to persist in a world in which in many ways she no longer belonged.  Issues of friendship, work, belonging, responsibility were all dealt with in clever, intelligent, and funny ways.  The great news for those who haven't seen this series (and there are many who don't have Showtime and therefore rely on DVDs for their experience with the show) is that Season Two is a much, much better season than the first.  Without exception, the writers manage to develop and expand all of the major characters, with the exception of George's father, who plays a lessened role.  George becomes a far richer character, finally at ease with being a reaper and acknowledging that she has responsibilities.  Her challenge in Season Two is deciding what she wants with the unlife that she has.  She struggles with issues of love, and grows considerably as a human being.  Even more than George, Rube (Mandy Patinkin) becomes a more complex, interesting character.  In a slowly developed story arc, we learn more about Rube's life, we get glimpses of his family (he learns that a daughter he fathered in real life is still living, and he visits her in a nursing home immediately before her death), and are given some hints as to his death (the results of a bank robbery, the details of which might have been explored in Season Three).  Mason, without ceasing to be a bit of a clown (in one episode, ""Send in the Clown,"" literally), is revealed in far more complex and interesting person than he did in Season One, while Daisy Adair becomes vastly more than the mere self-obsessed sexpot she was earlier.  In fact, Daisy becomes a many layered, sympathetic, impossible-to-predict individual.  In particular, her relationship with Mason, who is completely smitten with her, is developed in great detail.  George discovers that her parents are divorcing and that they are selling the house she grew up in, and we see her mother exploring new romance, and we watch her relationship with her daughter Reggie gain some depth as George's sister gradually comes out of the shellshock that gripped her in the first season following George's death.What is remarkable to me is that the show managed to become richer and more complex on virtually every level, all while generating a string of great individual episodes.  The frustrating thing about the show not being renewed is that there were a host of unexplored possibilities, so many unanswered questions.  Would George manage to find love?  Would her parents reconcile or find new relationships?  Would her mother find a buyer for the house?  Just how did Rube die, and was it related to the bank robbery?  Would anything ever happen between Daisy and Mason?  And there were a host of life experiences that had not yet been explored.  There was unquestionably a large amount of room for many more stories.DEAD LIKE ME is a great example of a show that doesn't fit traditional entertainment economic categories.  It was produced by MGM television, but shown on Showtime.  The latter at least in part declined to renew the show because its rating were not strong, while MGM wanted it to be renewed in part because of the strong DVD sales.  We have seen a number of shows that have enjoyed weak ratings on TV experience huge DVD sales.  FIREFLY, FAMILY GUY, and WONDERFALLS are three examples.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is one of the best selling TV series ever on DVD, but never enjoyed especially large ratings on TV.  My guess is that at some point the television production companies are going to have to work something out with the broadcast and cable networks to make it more attractive for the networks to keep shows that are highly successful on DVD but that do not get great ratings on the air.  At present, most of the benefit of keeping DEAD LIKE ME on would have primarily benefited MGM, but not Showtime.  Last year Twentieth Century Fox (not to be confused with FOX TV; though both have the same parent company, they are separate companies) very much wanted to keep ANGEL going because of its strong DVD sales, but the WB wanted to go in new directions (bad directions, it turned out, since none of its shows this year have gathered the ratings that ANGEL did, nor have any enjoyed the critical acclaim that it did).  More and more overall viewership of TV series is declining, while DVD sales and rentals of TV shows is increasing.  This is good for production companies, but bad for networks, and some formula needs to be found to make it good for both.  ANGEL was cancelled in part because Twentieth Century Fox refused to reduce the amount it charged the WB to show the series.  Until the production companies agree to help close the loss of income the networks are experiencing, I think we are going to see a lot of shows that have a small but dedicated audience fail to be renewed.  Everyone loses.  The production company loses the opportunity to sell their product to the networks and the potential DVD sales.  The networks lose because they are getting cheaper but more mediocre product.  And the fans of shows lose because they find high quality shows like DEAD LIKE ME pushed aside for blander and less interesting programming.At least we have two very fine seasons to watch of this very, very good series.  We can only hope that the television industry can find the right alchemy to make it possible for superb series like this survive in the future.",5,That rare show that is even better in its second

For those who still don't know the show, it is about Georgia Lass, an eighteen year old girl who suddenly dies when a toilet seat coming from the Mir space station crashes on her. Then she is recruited as a Grim Reaper.The first season was about the death of a beloved and how people try to deal with it, while the second season is different: Georgia has been dead for a year, and her family has slowly learnt to deal with her disappearance. The storyline seems to be about characters finding who they really are rather than how they  cope with death. Most of the characters see their lives change:Daisy's soul searching, Reggie grows up, Joy moves on while George tries to keep an eye on her family, but quite remotely...This season is amazing: the show is shrewdly written and some of the story lines are really moving - for example, the episode ""Send in the Clown"", in which Mason has to reap a little girl's father on her birthday, or all the episodes showing Joy trying to move on with her life while facing her divorce. The actors are all brilliant, because they try to be as subtle as possible, to convey emotions without overdoing it (but this is no sitcom after all).In this show, death is not really treated as a big deal, there is always a detail that will make you laugh (as George's nickname: ""Toilet seat-girl""). To me, this show is as good as TV can get, and even if it was cut down in its prime - as Georgia's character was, it will soon become a classic.As a French girl, I think that the DVD could at least have been subtitled in English, because even if I understand English quite well, I missed some of the lines and it did bother me (a lot)!! MGM is lucky the show is excellent, because as far as the DVD goes, it is not good, and its promotional extra features are dull.",5,Gone with the Wind,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,1892,"['Dead', 'Me', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'who', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'Georgia', 'Lass', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'suddenly', 'when', 'toilet', 'seat', 'coming', 'Mir', 'space', 'station', 'crashes', 'Then', 'recruited', 'Grim', 'Reaper.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'death', 'beloved', 'how', 'people', 'try', 'deal', 'second', 'season', 'different', 'Georgia', 'been', 'dead', 'year', 'family', 'slowly', 'learnt', 'deal', 'disappearance', 'storyline', 'be', 'characters', 'finding', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'rather', 'how', 'cope', 'death', 'Most', 'characters', 'see', 'lives', 'change', 'Daisy', 'soul', 'searching', 'Reggie', 'up', 'Joy', 'George', 'tries', 'keep', 'eye', 'family', 'quite', 'remotely', 'season', 'amazing', 'show', 'shrewdly', 'written', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'really', 'moving', 'example', 'episode', 'Send', 'Clown', 'Mason', 'reap', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'birthday', 'episodes', 'showing', 'Joy', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'facing', 'divorce', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'try', 'be', 'as', 'subtle', 'possible', 'convey', 'emotions', 'overdoing', 'sitcom', '.In', 'show', 'death', 'not', 'really', 'treated', 'big', 'deal', 'always', 'detail', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'George', 'nickname', 'Toilet', 'seat-girl', 'show', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'can', 'get', 'even', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'prime', 'Georgia', 'character', 'was', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'classic.As', 'French', 'girl', 'think', 'DVD', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'been', 'subtitled', 'English', 'even', 'understand', 'English', 'quite', 'well', 'missed', 'lines', 'did', 'bother', 'lot', 'MGM', 'lucky', 'show', 'excellent', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'not', 'good', 'promotional', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'dull']",Dead Like Me - The Complete Second Season

I LOVED watching the reaps and was a little let down during the last few episodes because of this. But, if there had been a third season they could have gone and done a little for both ""characters"" and ""reaps"" since they had laid more of the gridwork already. If you want to check it, i wrote a review for season one.

901013,A3UI51KFK0TKWQ,B00094ARGY,TA152H,"[11, 11]","Season two of, in my opinion, the finest series ever put on TV, lives up to the first and possibly surpasses it.As in the first season, this dry, witty dark comedy avoids all the lifeless (no pun intended) cliches of the typical brainless sitcom that so many people enjoy on network TV.  It always entertains, always has a sublime message that is never done obtusely, and evokes a span of emotions from sadness to happiness that is done so delicately it never seems manipulative.  Just a great show.Season two varies from the first in a few ways, at least as I see it.  The humor is a little less dry, the dialogue is less vulgar (thankfully), and some of the characters have changed somewhat.  Georgia becomes much more confident and much less the whiney, insecure, depressed girl from the first season.  Not sure if this is good or bad, because season one Georgia was terrific.  Daisy Adair is vastly improved; the overdone references to sex are lessened, and she becomes a sweet, sensitive, vulnerable, caring woman that is just as lost as the living, and trying to find herself.  She is much more believable than the first season's, and much more likeable as well.  Rube is still Rube, but is more humanized by his storyline with his daughter.  This storyline is done in an interesting and mysterious way, with clues given along the way until it finally resolves itself.Despite the name, and ostensibly being a harsh show, this is a really sweet show.  This is particularly so for the second season.  The final scene of the final episode, with Georgia smiling at her adoring former sister is in some ways a microcosm of the show - incredibly sweet, sad, delicate, poignant and beautifully mysterious and reassuring (to borrow a phrase from the first season).This is the easiest recommendation I could make for anything Amazon sells.

In the end it is she who declares ""I'm not afraid of anything,"" and demonstrates that this, by and large, may well be true.The potential that Delores Herbig (brown eyes) saw in the surly teen who came to Happy Times to get her very temporary job has finally realized itself; as has whatever else it was that Reuben obviously instantly saw in her.

In the second and final season George must grapple with a number of issues including becoming infatuated with someone from the world of the living--even worse he's about as clueless as they come. Mason continues to be a sober reaper for a little while at least until he sees the impact he has when he takes the soul of a father at his little girl's 6th birthday party. Even worse, Mason is forced to be the clown for the girl's party. It's no surprise that when he makes animal balloons they all look like genitals.As if the life of the dead couldn't get any worse, the group must take the souls of a serial killer in the season finale and final episode of the series. There's a pretty good featurette on how the optical effects are created for the series including those nasty Gravelings, a photo gallery and 10 minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, MGM doesn't incorporate the deleted scenes on the DVD so they are at the end of their respective episodes which makes viewing these are a bit surreal.The featurette on the second season features brief interviews with most of the cast and executive producer Steve Beeers.The drawbacks to the set are few. There's no commentary tracks on this set which is a pity. Even after the departure of creator/writer/co-producer Bryan Fuller the second season of the series continued to break new ground and the writing continued to be top notch.MGM seems to be regressive when it comes to DVDs; these sets don't have a chapter break after the opening credits which is a bit odd. Also, the concept of the ""play all"" feature that has become the standard for most TV series on DVD somehow continues to elude them. Other than that, the picture quality is exceptionally good with little video noise and a sharp anamorphic widescreen transfer. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround is utilized extremely well unlike a lot of TV shows that are put on DVD so those are factors in favor of this transfer.Sadly, also missing this time out is the clever packaging that housed the first season with it's transparent casing that surrounded the box that holds the slimline DVD cases.Another great TV show departs leaving a hole that Showtime can't fill at the moment. Supposedly (this is according to TVonDVD.com)the show was cancelled because it was expensive to produce but only had a cult following and Showtime wanted to use their limited resources for original programming for a big blockbuster type hit like ""Deadwood"" or ""The Sopranos"". Maybe they should have dropped the increasing weak ""The L Word"" or one of their insipid original series.

I admit it was an okay show, but it wasn't something I really wanted to watch.  I decided to buy the second season anyway, and I'm really glad I did because I really really enjoyed it.  The characters go thru some interesting changes.  Reggie became a little more than just a disturbed child, and they brought some interesting mythology to the show.  I'm really disappointed that the show was cancelled.  I have to say that the Putting Life into Death features aren't all that exciting, but I enjoyed the Dead Like Me Again.  I wish they offered some insight on this set as to why it was cancelled.My only beef with the set is that the font of the series title doesn't match the first season.  This doesn't look as nice when displayed by the spines, but I like the artwork better, so I guess it evens itself out.",5,Better than the first,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,877,"['bought', 'first', 'season', 'story', 'sounded', 'intersting', 'admit', 'was', 'okay', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'decided', 'buy', 'second', 'season', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'go', 'thru', 'interesting', 'changes', 'Reggie', 'became', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'disturbed', 'child', 'brought', 'interesting', 'mythology', 'show', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'have', 'say', 'Putting', 'Life', 'Death', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'enjoyed', 'Dead', 'Me', 'Again', 'wish', 'offered', 'insight', 'set', 'why', 'was', 'cancelled.My', 'only', 'beef', 'set', 'font', 'series', 'title', ""n't"", 'match', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'look', 'nice', 'when', 'displayed', 'spines', 'like', 'artwork', 'better', 'guess', 'out']",Dead Like Me - The Complete Second Season
901028,AZTOAD13FDS58,B00094ARGY,ZenPenguin,"[8, 8]","The previous reviews were all excellent.  ""Dead Like Me"" was, in my opinion, the very best show on television (is there anything Mandy Patinkin doesn't do superbly?).  It's a testament to the stupidity of the network elite that the show was cancelled.  Perhaps the Showtime executives are too stupid to tie their own shoes?  Feel ""Fat Actresses"" is a heady art form?  Or perhaps they just have their heads so far up their posteriors that they failed to appreciate a critically acclaimed and universally enjoyed masterpiece when they see it?Well, thank God for DVDs.  ""Dead Like Me"" is edgy, witty, intellectual, fast, raw, sexy, and oh so unbelievably funny.  Ellen Muth, you are one amazing actress.  There is one scene, in one episode, where you make a flying tackle across a crowded office, then scream ""Man Down"" as you take the poor guy out.  That was some awesome television - you deserve an award for that one scene alone.The true art form is one that never gets old.  These DVDs will never gather dust or suffer from neglect.  And the best part is that they pay for themselves, seeing as there's no reason in the world to waste any more money on Showtime.PS - Ellen, when it's time to go I hope you get my Post-It.",5,Sigh....,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1222,"['previous', 'reviews', 'were', 'excellent', 'Dead', 'Me', 'was', 'opinion', 'very', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'there', 'anything', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', ""n't"", 'do', 'superbly', 'testament', 'stupidity', 'network', 'elite', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Perhaps', 'Showtime', 'executives', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'tie', 'own', 'shoes', 'Feel', 'Fat', 'Actresses', 'heady', 'art', 'form', 'perhaps', 'just', 'have', 'heads', 'so', 'far', 'up', 'posteriors', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'universally', 'enjoyed', 'masterpiece', 'when', 'see', 'Well', 'thank', 'God', 'DVDs', 'Dead', 'Me', 'edgy', 'witty', 'intellectual', 'fast', 'raw', 'sexy', 'oh', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'funny', 'Ellen', 'Muth', 'are', 'one', 'amazing', 'actress', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'make', 'flying', 'tackle', 'crowded', 'office', 'then', 'Man', 'Down', 'take', 'poor', 'guy', 'out', 'was', 'awesome', 'television', 'deserve', 'award', 'one', 'scene', 'alone.The', 'true', 'art', 'form', 'one', 'never', 'old', 'DVDs', 'will', 'never', 'gather', 'dust', 'suffer', 'neglect', 'best', 'part', 'pay', 'seeing', 'reason', 'world', 'waste', 'more', 'money', 'Showtime.PS', 'Ellen', 'when', 'time', 'go', 'hope', 'get', 'Post-It']",Dead Like Me - The Complete Second Season
