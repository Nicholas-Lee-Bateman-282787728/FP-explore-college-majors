Peter Jackson and friends have created for us all, their new version of this beloved fantasy classic changing many things about it in the doing. It's still the same story, only for me they've made it better then I ever could have imagined! They've enhanced this short story by fleshing it out into a complete, comprehensive and full-bodied work that it never was, but now is. Elements of ""The Hobbit"" that were never there in the original book form have been lovingly brought to the forefront along with the original story line. They have been thoroughly examined and re-written adding depth, atmospheres and more enchanting characters then ever before imagined! I loved it! This theme, is surly continuing with the second installment coming at the end of 2013 and the last coming in 2014. Wow, that's a long wait! I can hardly wait!

The included additions are silly and add nothing to the story.  Peter Jackson and his writing team need to understand that they're not ""improving"" The Hobbit, they're just adding filler.  Also, see my additional comments below re: the ""Extended"" version.I can see splitting this into three movies, but why add the filler when there's so much worthwhile material to use?  This isn't about being a ""purist"", it's about telling the story that the studio supposedly found so compelling that they had to tell it.  I know it's an empty complaint, because that's how Hollywood works, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.This is a good movie, it's worth seeing, but it's also a bit silly how the story has been changed******************************************************************Edit 11/12/13:  Amazon won't allow me to review the Extended Edition separately, so here're my 2 cents:If you enjoyed the extended LOTR movies you'll likely enjoy this.  Is it ""better""?  I don't know that there's more detail to flesh out like in the LOTR saga, but I was still hoping that this would feel a bit closer to the book.  It doesn't, really.  It feels a bit like a cash-grab, but it's still fun to see.  But I've finally put my finger on one of my issues with the Peter Jackson movies:  he doesn't know what tone to take regarding the dwarves.  They're short, see?  So they must be comic relief, right?  Er...um...well, no.  So there are these odd tonal shifts - they're solemn warriors trying to regain their lost kingdom (and fortune), there are these moments of earnest, grave hand-wringing of the their past and the plight of their people.  Then they're all comical buffoons played almost as broadly as the 3 Stooges.  That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too much of one.  So, essentially, Peter Jackson is incapable of having these dwarves on screen and ""playing it straight"", so to speak.  A bit of whimsey is fine, but it feels like this underlying disrespect for the characters is built into the script.I don't know, it's a semi-fun adventure film, but to me the tone is just off.  Plus the ""Elves vs. Dwarves"" stuff is played up way too much.I'd say this movie is still worth watching, but I'm not really expecting much from the overall 3 movie cycle.",4,You have to forget your love of the book a bit...,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2502,"['think', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'especially', 'extended', 'versions', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'disappointing', 'many', 'small', 'ways', 'due', 'many', 'unneccesary', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'story', 'characters', 'motivations', 'etc', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'included', 'additions', 'are', 'silly', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'writing', 'team', 'need', 'understand', ""'re"", 'not', 'improving', 'Hobbit', ""'re"", 'just', 'adding', 'filler', 'Also', 'see', 'additional', 'comments', 're', 'Extended', 'version.I', 'can', 'see', 'splitting', 'three', 'movies', 'why', 'add', 'filler', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'use', ""n't"", 'about', 'being', 'purist', 'telling', 'story', 'studio', 'supposedly', 'found', 'so', 'compelling', 'had', 'tell', 'know', 'empty', 'complaint', 'how', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'frustrating.This', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'also', 'bit', 'silly', 'how', 'story', 'been', 'changed******************************************************************Edit', '11/12/13', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'review', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'separately', 'so', 'here', ""'re"", '2', 'cents', 'enjoyed', 'extended', 'LOTR', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'detail', 'flesh', 'out', 'LOTR', 'saga', 'was', 'still', 'hoping', 'would', 'feel', 'bit', 'closer', 'book', ""n't"", 'really', 'bit', 'cash-grab', 'still', 'fun', 'see', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'issues', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'movies', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tone', 'take', 'regarding', 'dwarves', ""'re"", 'short', 'see', 'must', 'be', 'comic', 'relief', 'right', 'Er', 'um', 'well', 'So', 'are', 'odd', 'tonal', 'shifts', ""'re"", 'solemn', 'warriors', 'trying', 'regain', 'lost', 'kingdom', 'fortune', 'are', 'moments', 'earnest', 'grave', 'hand-wringing', 'past', 'plight', 'people', 'Then', ""'re"", 'comical', 'buffoons', 'played', 'almost', 'as', 'broadly', '3', 'Stooges', 'bit', 'exaggeration', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'So', 'essentially', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'incapable', 'having', 'dwarves', 'screen', 'playing', 'straight', 'so', 'speak', 'bit', 'whimsey', 'fine', 'underlying', 'disrespect', 'characters', 'built', 'script.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'semi-fun', 'adventure', 'film', 'tone', 'just', 'off', 'Elves', 'vs.', 'Dwarves', 'stuff', 'played', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'much.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'expecting', 'much', 'overall', '3', 'movie', 'cycle']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Well, actually only the first third of it is released so far...I was tempted to wait for all three parts of this before I watched it.  After all, I read the hobbit in less than a week first time, so many years ago.  There were not any places I wanted to put the book down.  Later, I enjoyed reading this book out loud several times, a chapter at a sitting.  No one wanted to wait more than a day for the next reading.  Having watched this first part, I am finding waiting a year for the second part a little disconcerting, even though I thoroughly know the story.

1448310,A9VSDB7HJFMAO,B0059XTU1S,AJ Hayden,"[4, 6]","ACTUAL RATING: 3.5 or maybe 3.75*Quick Note: I haven't read The Hobbit, so I'm not exactly comparing it to the book. I have read summaries of the novel though (yes, I know, I'm a cheater), so I'm going off of thThe Hobbit isn't a bad movie. It honestly isn't. It was definitely one of my favorite movies from 2012. But it just wasn't quite what it could have been. And to answer the question of ""Is The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings better?"" In my opinion, Lord of the Rings is the better movie.Now, there's a lot of good stuff in this movie, don't get me wrong.The acting is fantastic. Martin Freeman IS Bilbo. You do not doubt for one second that he is Bilbo. In a lot of ways, I found him to be more likable than Frodo (who I still like as a character, but, well, that's a different story.) Freeman is just endearing as the unassuming hobbit from Bag End. Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Gandalf and Gollum, respectively. To no one's surprise, they do great. They are every bit as good as they were in The Lord of the Rings.The dwarves are the ensemble here, the way the Fellowship was in the first Lord of the Rings movie. We only really get to know Thorin as a character as far as the dwarves go. And I must say, Richard Armitage does an admirable job playing the conflicted Thorin Oakenshield. As for the other dwarves, they all did a nice job in their roles and were entertaining to watch, despite the fact that we only get glimpses of their character here and there. (And not to mention, there are some very attractive dwarves.)There are also some very well-done scenes in the movie. I enjoyed the scene where the dwarves all crash at Bilbo's house. Personally, I think it conveyed the fun, lighter tone the movie was trying to get across (more on that later.) It's a nice insight into Bilbo's characters and a nice way to meet the dwarves.The riddles scene with Gollum was great. I loved the humor that was thrown in here and there, but that the scene was also creepy and had some tension. It was interesting to see Gollum in a different light. You almost pitied him when Bilbo took the ring and almost kiled him.The beginning scene with Bilbo and Frodo was a nice addition. It was short, but it was a nice shout-out to the LotR trilogy. While Frodo seemed incredibly thin and pasty (maybe it was just me), it was sort of...chilling to see him pre-Ring. I know that sounds like a bizarre way to put it, but seeing him before his journey seemed strange and kind of sad. The whole time he was on screen I was just thinking about what was to come for him.Middle-Earth looks gorgeous. There seems to be more CGI this time, but still, it looks beautiful.And I can't mention what I liked about the movie without mentioning the music. Howard Shore has done another great job with the score for this film. The movie captures the simplicity of Hobbit life, the tension of thte battle scenes, and everything in between. The Misty Mountains song is lovely. It just sounds like it came straight out of Middle Earth.Unfortunately, despite the great acting, the music, and some well-done scenes, The Hobbit had its flaws.There were a lot of little things that botherd me about the movie. I thought the Goblin King was incedibly silly and didn't look menacing at all. He just looked digusting. I was hoping they would go the ""Orc Route"" with the Goblin King and make him look creepy and hellish, not goofy and over-the-top gross. His one line, ""Well, that will do it!""...eh, n'mind. I'm not going to get into that.Radagast was also unnecessarily silly. While I've never read the books, if I remember correctly, he is supposed to be as powerful as Gandalf (**but I could be wrong about that**). And while he may be a little nutty, this movie just took it too far. His rabbit-pulled sled was ridiculous and the fact that he had bird poop in his hair did him no favors. I mean, really, I'm supposed to think THIS guy is as powerful as Gandalf?The film's two biggest issues, however, are the pacing and the tone.I feel like this movie couldn't quite decide what audience it wanted to appease the most. ""The Hobbit"" was written as a children's book, so I wasn't expecting this to have the dark, sometimes grim tone the ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy had. However, with this movie, there were a couple moments that seemed pretty dark. The movie appeared to want to try to sort of ""age"" the story, if you will, to appeal to more of the adult LotR/Hobbit fans. And yet, we have things like wizards with bird poop in their hair and overly grotesque goblin kings and just cheap humor. The movie does have its moments of more mature humor that works, but not many. And this isn't to say it didn't need humor, but it didn't do it well. ""Lord of the Rings"" had much better, subtle humor when it was needed. The film seemed to be trying to strike the balance between being mature enough for adult viewers, while still being good for the kids, and unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark.Then there's the pacing. As I'm sure everyone knows, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is only part one of what is going to be a three-part series. Unfortunately, the source material is only about 280 pages (at least my copy is.) Needless to say, the pacing of this film suffers. Since there are still have two more three-hour-long movies to fill, the scenes here feel very long. The movie only covers about five or six chapters of the book, I believe. There are several times in this movie where it feels overly looooong. The fight scene with the goblins felt long. The beginning, while I liked it for introducing us to the dwarves, was long. There were just quite a few times where the movie dragged and the tension was pretty much lost.So, ""The Hobbit"" isn't a terrible film. It's enjoyable. The acting's great, it has some good scenes, and the music is amazing. But it suffers from pacing and tone and it definitely isn't as good as Lord of the Rings.",3,"A good movie, but it doesn't match Lord of the Rings",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,5948,"['ACTUAL',

But the movie is at all times dark and ominous, like LotR.It's quite sad to say that I didn't enjoy it. I would rate myself among the most enthusiastic of Tolkien fans. I just think that the ""LotR approach"" was the wrong one to apply to this movie.",2,Doesn't measure up,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,686,"['As', 'sad', 'must', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'expectations', 'What', 'worked', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'here', 'Hobbit', 'not', 'epic', 'saga', 'more', 'straightforward', 'adventure', 'story', 'short', 'book', ""n't"", 'dismal', 'bleak', 'gray', 'supposed', 'be', 'energetic', 'exciting', 'funny', 'note', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'choice', 'play', 'young', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'movie', 'times', 'dark', 'ominous', 'LotR.It', 'quite', 'sad', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'would', 'rate', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'just', 'think', 'LotR', 'approach', 'was', 'wrong', 'one', 'apply', 'movie']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448319,A392BU15592V2V,B0059XTU1S,Alfred D. Byrd,"[65, 84]","I put off seeing the Hobbit movie in part because I read all of the critics' reviews of it. You may know what they said: too slow-paced, too stodgily faithful to the book, overwhelmed by extraneous material thrown in, just plain silly, and just not up to the prequel-sequel. Now that I've taken in a matin&eacute;e of the movie, I have to ask this question:What movie did the critics watch?The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (TH:AUJ) was the most fun that I've had at the theater in a long time. Yes, folks, I did use the f-word just now. Let me use it again: fun, fun, fun! I won't say that the first Hobbit movie was better than the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy, but I will say that it was more fun.As a book, The Hobbit presented a challenge for being filmed: it's both a children's book and the prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the acme of high fantasy. Given such a source, a movie based on The Hobbit had to combine whimsy with high adventure without letting either overwhelm the other.I'm here to say that Peter Jackson rose gloriously to the challenge. I fell in love with TH:AUJ from its introduction, intercutting bucolic scenes from the Shire on the eve of Bilbo Baggins's one hundred and eleventh birthday with majestic, marvelous, and tragic scenes of the Mannish trade center of Dale and the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. These scenes showed all of the loving attention to detail of the LOTR movies and beautifully set the scene for a sixty-year's younger Bilbo's adventures.In the inimitable ""perfectly faithful to the book, which I'm completely rewriting"" Peter Jackson style, he pitchforks us moviegoers next into Bilbo's meeting with the wandering wizard Gandalf and with thirteen Dwarves led by the obsessive Thorin Oakenshield, heir to the lost kingdom of Erebor. Jackson captures beautifully the mirth and mayhem of Bilbo's unexpected dinner party as well as the dark drama behind Thorin's quest, on which the reluctant Bilbo is supposed to go as a burglar.Soon, Bilbo is running out his front door without a handkerchief, and he and we are off on an adventure that won't let up. Some critics complain that each scene TH:AUJ is longer than scenes were in the LOTR trilogy, but what the critics call a fault, I call a virtue: we have a chance to see a whole storyline play out rather than watching telescoped bits and pieces of scenes that we got in the trilogy. The pace and the flow of TH:AUJ made it seem to me far shorter than its two hours and forty some-odd minutes of running time. For me, the movie never slowed down.Parts of TH:AUJ are over the top, but, more often than not, gloriously so. I found Sylvester McCoy's portrayal of Radagast the Brown -- a portrayal in which he largely reprises his take on Dr. Who -- far less intrusive than critics have made it out to be. Even his rabbit-drawn sleigh had a mad logic to it. As for mad logic, the battle in the halls of the Great Goblin under the Misty Mountains won't be believed, but may well just be enjoyed.Between scenes of adventure, there are scenes of Elvish wonders and of Middle-Earth's beauty that will bring tears of joy to Tolkienphiles' eyes. At its best, TH:AUJ is a visual extravaganza that makes the prequel-sequel look drab.TH:AUJ goes only through chapter seven of The Hobbit. Purists may sniff at the enhanced role given to Bilbo in the movie compared with what he played in that part of the book, in which he was mainly baggage. My response is, ""Hey, the enhanced role works!"" Along with it, you get to see Gollum, as scene-stealing as ever,and even glimpses of the dragon Smaug, who must carry the next movie, and looks as if he'll do so with style.I'll be the first to admit that TH:AUJ isn't as respectable as the LOTR trilogy. On the other hand, as Bilbo Baggins learns, it's not until you give up being respectable that you have adventures.",5,An Unexpected Pleasure,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,3864,"['put', 'off', 'seeing', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'part', 'read', 'critics', 'reviews', 'may', 'know', 'what', 'said', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'too', 'stodgily', 'faithful', 'book', 'overwhelmed', 'extraneous', 'material', 'thrown', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'prequel-sequel', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'matin', 'eacute', 'e', 'movie', 'have', 'ask', 'question', 'What', 'movie', 'did', 'critics', 'watch', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'was', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'theater', 'long', 'time', 'Yes', 'folks', 'did', 'use', 'f-word', 'just', 'now', 'Let', 'use', 'again', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'first', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'fun.As', 'book', 'Hobbit', 'presented', 'challenge', 'being', 'filmed', 'children', 'book', 'prequel', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'acme', 'high', 'fantasy', 'Given', 'source', 'movie', 'based', 'Hobbit', 'had', 'combine', 'whimsy', 'high', 'adventure', 'letting', 'other.I', ""'m"", 'here', 'say', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'rose', 'gloriously', 'challenge', 'fell', 'love', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'introduction', 'intercutting', 'bucolic', 'scenes', 'Shire', 'eve', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'one', 'hundred', 'eleventh', 'birthday', 'majestic', 'marvelous', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'Mannish', 'trade', 'center', 'Dale', 'Dwarf', 'Kingdom', 'Erebor', 'Lonely', 'Mountain', 'scenes', 'showed', 'loving', 'attention', 'detail', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'beautifully', 'set', 'scene', 'sixty-year', 'younger', 'Bilbo', 'adventures.In', 'inimitable', 'perfectly', 'faithful', 'book', ""'m"", 'completely', 'rewriting', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'style', 'moviegoers', 'Bilbo', 'meeting', 'wandering', 'wizard', 'Gandalf', 'thirteen', 'Dwarves', 'led', 'obsessive', 'Thorin', 'Oakenshield', 'heir', 'lost', 'kingdom', 'Erebor', 'Jackson', 'beautifully', 'mirth', 'mayhem', 'Bilbo', 'unexpected', 'dinner', 'party', 'as', 'well', 'dark', 'drama', 'Thorin', 'quest', 'reluctant', 'Bilbo', 'supposed', 'go', 'burglar.Soon', 'Bilbo', 'running', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'handkerchief', 'are', 'off', 'adventure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'critics', 'complain', 'scene', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'longer', 'scenes', 'were', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'what', 'critics', 'call', 'fault', 'call', 'virtue', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'whole', 'storyline', 'play', 'rather', 'watching', 'telescoped', 'bits', 'pieces', 'scenes', 'got', 'trilogy', 'pace', 'flow', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'made', 'seem', 'far', 'shorter', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'some-odd', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'never', 'slowed', 'down.Parts', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'are', 'top', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'gloriously', 'so', 'found', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'portrayal', 'Radagast', 'Brown', 'portrayal', 'largely', 'take', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'far', 'less', 'intrusive', 'critics', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'Even', 'rabbit-drawn', 'sleigh', 'had', 'mad', 'logic', 'mad', 'logic', 'battle', 'halls', 'Great', 'Goblin', 'Misty', 'Mountains', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'believed', 'may', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'enjoyed.Between', 'scenes', 'adventure', 'are', 'scenes', 'Elvish', 'wonders', 'Middle-Earth', 'beauty', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'joy', 'Tolkienphiles', 'eyes', 'best', 'TH', 'AUJ', 'visual', 'extravaganza', 'prequel-sequel', 'look', 'drab.TH', 'AUJ', 'only', 'chapter', 'seven', 'Hobbit', 'Purists', 'may', 'sniff', 'enhanced', 'role', 'given', 'Bilbo', 'movie', 'compared', 'what', 'played', 'part', 'book', 'was', 'mainly', 'baggage', 'response', 'Hey', 'enhanced', 'role', 'get', 'see', 'Gollum', 'as', 'scene-stealing', 'ever', 'even', 'glimpses', 'dragon', 'Smaug', 'who', 'must', 'carry', 'next', 'movie', 'as', ""'ll"", 'do', 'so', 'style.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'TH', 'AUJ', ""n't"", 'as', 'respectable', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'other', 'hand', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'respectable', 'have', 'adventures']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448352,A2OIQ2N0E67EVT,B0059XTU1S,Amazon Customer,"[35, 45]","I have been a huge fan of these books for a very long time.  Tolkien took classic northern myth and fairy tails and re-spun them into a literary fantasy masterpiece.  Unfortunately many years after they were written a man named Peter Jackson came along and decided that the source material was not good enough and that he could somehow change it all for the better.  There are a few qualities about this film I liked such as the actors who portray Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo.  I also enjoyed the oh so important songs actually portrayed in the film.  These things however are not enough to save this franchise in my eyes however.  The orcs are magically able to fight in open daylight in several scenes (this would completely negate the need for Uruk-hai in the later stories if this were true).  Bilbo tackles a full grown orc off his feet and gains the upper ground in a wrestling match before stabbing him to death.  These small details I can ignore but the blatant use of cartoon physics (domino trees as one example), silly cartoon voices (the trolls for one) and terrible dialogue (&#34;that'll about do it&#34; as the goblin king dies) make the whole movie feel like a Saturday morning cartoon.  I realize that The Hobbit is a slightly more childish and light hearted tale than the rest of the ring saga but it was never downright ridiculous.  And while I am talking about silly, what is up with the strange dwarven hairstyles.  They look more like something out of a Disney cartoon than a Tolkien movie.  And who decided that dwarves are Scottish?  It would also be nice to hear the worgs and eagles speak as they did in the book.  Taking council with the king of eagles would have been a really beautiful thing to see brought to life.  Lastly Radaghast the brown (don't know if I spelled that right) was one living Disney/wb cartoon all rolled into one.  And why bird crap on his head?Beyond all that the movie is fairly polished other than a bit overuse of CG.  Many breathtaking scenes as we have come to expect from Peter.  There is a great deal of powerful acting but some of the best scenes are marred with silly visuals.  Soundtrack is fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did not just recycle the previous music for this film.  There is a lot to be praised but at the end of the day I would rather have a well written story as close to the source material as possible than a beautiful film hollow and empty of the magic the books captured.",2,More of a cartoon than the actual cartoon,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2476,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'books', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Tolkien', 'took', 'classic', 'northern', 'myth', 'fairy', 'tails', 're-spun', 'literary', 'fantasy', 'masterpiece', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'years', 'were', 'written', 'man', 'named', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'came', 'along', 'decided', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'could', 'somehow', 'change', 'better', 'are', 'few', 'qualities', 'film', 'liked', 'such', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'Thorin', 'Gandalf', 'Bilbo', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'oh', 'so', 'important', 'songs', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'film', 'things', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'franchise', 'eyes', 'however', 'orcs', 'are', 'magically', 'able', 'fight', 'open', 'daylight', 'several', 'scenes', 'would', 'completely', 'negate', 'need', 'Uruk-hai', 'later', 'stories', 'were', 'true', 'Bilbo', 'full', 'grown', 'orc', 'off', 'feet', 'gains', 'upper', 'ground', 'wrestling', 'match', 'stabbing', 'death', 'small', 'details', 'can', 'ignore', 'blatant', 'use', 'cartoon', 'physics', 'domino', 'trees', 'one', 'example', 'silly', 'cartoon', 'voices', 'trolls', 'one', 'terrible', 'dialogue', '34', ""'ll"", 'about', 'do', '34', 'goblin', 'king', 'dies', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'feel', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'realize', 'Hobbit', 'slightly', 'more', 'childish', 'light', 'hearted', 'tale', 'rest', 'ring', 'saga', 'was', 'never', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'am', 'talking', 'silly', 'what', 'up', 'strange', 'dwarven', 'hairstyles', 'look', 'more', 'something', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'Tolkien', 'movie', 'who', 'decided', 'dwarves', 'are', 'Scottish', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'nice', 'hear', 'worgs', 'speak', 'did', 'book', 'Taking', 'council', 'king', 'eagles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'see', 'brought', 'life', 'Lastly', 'Radaghast', 'brown', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'spelled', 'right', 'was', 'one', 'living', 'Disney/wb', 'cartoon', 'rolled', 'one', 'why', 'bird', 'crap', 'head', 'Beyond', 'movie', 'fairly', 'polished', 'other', 'bit', 'overuse', 'CG', 'Many', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Peter', 'great', 'deal', 'powerful', 'acting', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'marred', 'silly', 'visuals', 'Soundtrack', 'fantastic', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'recycle', 'previous', 'music', 'film', 'lot', 'be', 'praised', 'end', 'day', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'close', 'source', 'material', 'possible', 'beautiful', 'film', 'hollow', 'empty', 'magic', 'books', 'captured']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

So, the extended version has ONLY 13 EXTRA MINUTES OF ADDED FOOTAGE (As I mentioned previously in my review: The additions are not expected to be as huge as those of LOTR).It was a pleasure to return to Peter Jackson's middle earth after nearly a decade (The last time it was LOTR). Hobbit is hugely entertaining, exceptionally well done movie that has been created by carefully handling the original subject. Here is what you get in this product, what is this movie about, and a little food for thought if anyone wants to wait for ""extended version"" of the movie, which is supposed to be released sometimes at the end of this year.1. THE PRODUCT:Hobbit blu ray dazzles by all means. The picture ans sound quality is reference grade, and the details are exceptional. This set has both 3D and 2D versions of the movie, a special feature (Blu ray, High Def), DVD and the ultraviolet digital copy. Hence, this gives you an options of watching the movie in all possible formats. The 3D quality is superb, with exceptional depth and clarity. Having owned many 3D blu rays, I would rank this among top 10 blu rays out there.2. THE MOVIE:Hobbit is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and is based upon the children's book by JRR Tolkien of the same name. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of the trilogy, and the next two movies are as follows:Movie 2: Hobbit: The desolation of the Smaug (scheduled for Dec 2013)Movie 3: Hobbit: There and back again (Scheduled for Dec 2014)The book is classic, there is no doubt about it. However Peter Jackson did an exceptional work in bringing Tolkien's creation to the celluloid. His passion about the subject is known to the world, and equally admired. Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no exception. Though there will be debates whether the movie was completely true to the book or not, I personally feel that making a TRILOGY over ONE childrens book is no joke, and only Peter Jackson's vision would have made this possible.The movie appeared slow to many, which I can understand, because Hobbit, in general, has little less material than the LOTR. However, I felt it was about the right length, as I like to stay in Jackson's middle earth for little longer. Most importantly, the movie doesn't get bore at any time, and has the exceptional art of storytelling (IMO, You do not rush when you tell a story. The most important part is to keep the audience engaged, and this movie does it brilliantly). Hence, if you loved LOTR, Hobbit is a must buy, as this gives you the opportunity to visit the middle earth one more time.3. EXTENDED EDITION: Should you wait (and if yes, then how long, and that too, for mere extra 13 minutes)There are announcements being made about the extended version of this movie being launched in Dec 2013. With the LOTR history, I wouldn't be surprised about it. However, before you completely ignore this 3D edition, there are few things I would like to point out:a. Even if extended version gets out, I doubt it will be in 3D. Looks like 2D would be the only option.b. Only a true fan of the movie would wait for the extended version, right? In that case, think: there are TWO more movies yet to come, so, your wait is not going to be ""over"" by Dec 2013. There will be two more 'theatrical' hobbits (and let's assume even they will have extended counterparts). I understand I am going too far, but I said only because even I have those movies in my wish list already! Hence, even I am thinking of making a 'wise buy"" than double dip. So, think a little ahead before you make any decision.c. As of today, what I hear is even if the extended edition is out, it will have 25-30 min of extra footage (Not huge addition like LOTR). I don't doubt that those additions will be great, but they don't seem to be as huge as they were for LOTR.d. Even with 'theatrical' vs 'exdended' movies, I don't think they will be sold together. Most likely it will follow the LOTR saga (Remember, you still don't have Theatrical and Extended LOTR on one Blu ray/Blu ray set due to space limits).Summary:If you like to see Hobbit in 3D, go for this edition. I really doubt the extended version (if it's out and whenever it's out) will get a 3D blu ray release. You will have plenty of 2D (regular ) blu ray editions to come in future (by making all permutations and combinations), but I have not seen 3D versions of the trilogies being sold seperately. With the exceptional lengths of these movies, I doubt there will be an ""all in one"" pack. Make a wise choice considering your personal preferences.",5,"Hobbit 3D Blu ray: Product Review, a little basic info about the movie and a thought: who should wait for the extended

I went to the midnight showing of The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey and was mesmerized by the time it was over. Peter Jackson brilliantly directs and brings us back to Middle-Earth as though we had never left. Jackson's choice of 48 frames per second is the right one because the images are very crisp and there is literally no blurring during action scenes at all. Its pretty amazing how sharp the images look. As to those who have read The Hobbit, you already know that you are in for a great movie because so many great parts are in the first third of the book. Jackson's decision to make The Hobbit into three movies was the right one because they are able to stay extremely faithful to the book and add a few things that were a pleasant surprise. The scene when Bilbo and Gollum play a game of riddles is mesmerizing and the best scene in the movie. That scene puts the movie over the top and from that point on, your in for one hell of a ride. Andy Serkis definitely deserves some Oscar recognition for his portrayal of Gollum. The filmmakers use motion capture to capture Serkis' performance and it is a brilliant one.

Maybe I should just skip the rest, but virtually every one of them is tauted as one of the greatest films of all time, so my curiosity gets the best of me.  In terms of positives, ""The Hobbit"" has a good lead actor (Martin Freeman) and the opening 30 minutes are engaging, but much of the rest of the film drags.  There are a few decent (albeit short) fights during the middle (with a few longer fights near the end), but there are too many side plots and too much filler material to slug through.  The script is unfocused and unengaging.I think one of Peter Jackson's big problems is his failure to set-up intermediate goals for the protagonists.  Instead, he sets up a long-term goal and has the protagonists walk around for 6 hours while they fend off random attacks.  This creates a monotonous, dull framework that cripples the enjoyability of the film.Compare this to Clash of the Titans (1981), which laid out a series of fascinating obstacles that were accomplished throughout the course of one 2-hour film:-capturing and taming Pegasus-seeking the blind Stygian witches and coercing information out of them-venturing to the Gorgon island and defeating the canine guardian Dioskilos-entering Medusa's lair, defeating her, and retrieving her head-defeating Calibos and his giant scorpions-facing the KrakenI think Clash of the Titans is a true epic adventure because the long-term goal requires a plethora of intermediate accomplishments. They're not just arbitrary dangers that the protagonists encounter along the way. Many of these goals are necessary steps that must be taken in order to achieve the final long-term goal. When all is said and done, I can look back and admire the difficulty and complexity of the journey. Each individual success becomes a memorable event.Such is not the case with The Hobbit, which basically has the protagonists walk around and fight villains without any interesting identifiable purpose other than reaching the dragon's lair - an event that will likely occur in the 6th hour of the trilogy (if we're lucky!). It just feels like a series of meaningless clashes that become conflicts because the protagonists were not lucky enough to avoid them along the way to reaching their long-term goal. The obstacles feel arbitrary and there's no anticipation or build-up to any of them. There's no sense of accomplishment to the protagonists' actions.The action choreography is not impressive enough to make up for any of the flaws.  The escape thru the lair of the Ballsack Chin King is pretty good, but a bit too tension-less.  Gollum shows up and is annoying as usual.  Gandalf uses the same three tricks that he used in LOTR.  Can Peter Jackson please give us a few cool magic spells for a change?  I don't think I've ever seen such a lazy attempt at wizardry in my entire life",2,The lack of intermediate goals is a problem.,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,2889,"[""'m"", 'having', 'difficulty', 'sitting', 'recent', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'films', 'Maybe', 'should', 'just', 'skip', 'rest', 'virtually', 'one', 'tauted', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'curiosity', 'best', 'terms', 'positives', 'Hobbit', 'good', 'lead', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'opening', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'engaging', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'drags', 'are', 'few', 'decent', 'short', 'fights', 'middle', 'few', 'longer', 'fights', 'end', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'side', 'plots', 'too', 'much', 'filler', 'material', 'slug', 'script', 'unfocused', 'unengaging.I', 'think', 'one', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'big', 'problems', 'failure', 'set-up', 'intermediate', 'goals', 'protagonists', 'Instead', 'up', 'long-term', 'goal', 'protagonists', 'walk', '6', 'hours', 'fend', 'off', 'random', 'attacks', 'monotonous', 'dull', 'framework', 'enjoyability', 'film.Compare', 'Clash', 'Titans', '1981', 'laid', 'out', 'series', 'fascinating', 'obstacles', 'were', 'accomplished', 'course', 'one', '2-hour', 'film', '-capturing', 'taming', 'Pegasus-seeking', 'blind', 'Stygian', 'witches', 'coercing', 'information', 'them-venturing', 'Gorgon', 'island', 'defeating', 'canine', 'guardian', 'Dioskilos-entering', 'Medusa', 'lair', 'defeating', 'retrieving', 'head-defeating', 'Calibos', 'giant', 'scorpions-facing', 'KrakenI', 'think', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'true', 'epic', 'adventure', 'long-term', 'goal', 'plethora', 'intermediate', 'accomplishments', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'arbitrary', 'dangers', 'protagonists', 'encounter', 'way', 'Many', 'goals', 'are', 'necessary', 'steps', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'order', 'achieve', 'final', 'long-term', 'goal', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'admire', 'difficulty', 'complexity', 'journey', 'individual', 'success', 'memorable', 'event.Such', 'not', 'case', 'Hobbit', 'basically', 'protagonists', 'walk', 'fight', 'villains', 'interesting', 'identifiable', 'purpose', 'other', 'reaching', 'dragon', 'lair', 'event', 'will', 'likely', 'occur', '6th', 'hour', 'trilogy', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'just', 'feels', 'series', 'meaningless', 'clashes', 'become', 'conflicts', 'protagonists', 'were', 'not', 'lucky', 'enough', 'avoid', 'along', 'way', 'reaching', 'long-term', 'goal', 'obstacles', 'feel', 'arbitrary', 'anticipation', 'build-up', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'protagonists', 'actions.The', 'action', 'choreography', 'not', 'impressive', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'escape', 'lair', 'Ballsack', 'Chin', 'King', 'pretty', 'good', 'bit', 'too', 'tension-less', 'Gollum', 'up', 'annoying', 'usual', 'Gandalf', 'same', 'three', 'tricks', 'used', 'LOTR', 'Can', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'please', 'give', 'few', 'cool', 'magic', 'spells', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'lazy', 'attempt', 'wizardry', 'entire', 'life']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

I also just reread The Hobbit a few months ago while waiting for the DVD to come out. I own the extended versions of all three LOTR movies, saw all three movies in the theater (more than once on Fellowship of the Ring) and watch the DVDs fairly regularly. As a fantasy/sci-fi dork with children who love the same genre I should have been the perfect consumer of The Hobbit. I was leery about the movie based on the reviews and the lead up to the film so I actually decided to wait until the DVD came out. It came out yesterday (quite quickly I thought from a release date in mid-December) and our copy came from Amazon on the release date so after dinner we sat down as a family to watch.Very disappointed. Like couldn't wait for it to get over disappointed.I found The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey movie to be almost 3 hours of frustration. My kids mostly seemed to find it boring. Maybe I shouldn't have reread the book last month because the movie was only loosely based on it and every time the movie went astray it distracted me. I guess the comparisons were inevitable but they are valid and comparing the two trilogies is like comparing a high school play with a Broadway production.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a bold, risky production that was shot all at once before anyone knew if they would have commercial success and the result was one of the best adaptations of a beloved book that you will ever find. I left the theater after The Fellowship of the Ring bummed that I had to wait a year for The Two Towers. I couldn't wait for the movies to come out each December and bought the DVD sets as soon as I could. I can say that I have not only watched the movies over and over, I have also watched most if not all of the hours of special features.The Hobbit has the feel of cheap exploitation; hey we made a ton of money on the LOTR movies so let's see if we can do the same thing with The Hobbit. I was quite concerned this would be the case after all the pre-production squabbling and then when it was announced that one book, The Hobbit, would be divided up into three movies while the much larger and more detailed LOTR trilogy was also done in three movies, I was definitely not excited. In many ways The Hobbit was just like so many other attempts to make a cheap buck by exploiting a beloved book. I enjoy the old cartoon version of The Hobbit more than what I watched last night.There are so many places where the scenes just dragged on and either were clumsy attempts at linking the Hobbit to LOTR or ridiculous action sequences to spice up events from the book:The backstory of the fall of the Lonely Mountain. The interminably long intro with Elijah Wood as Frodo. Every single scene involving Radagast was horrible, Radagast being turned into a failed attempt at comedy relief. The inexplicable gathering with Saruman and Galadriel in Rivendell. The random ""pale orc"" that was supposed to be Azog the Defiler was some of the worst CGI I have seen in a long time. The Great Goblin who looked like something from a kids cartoon rather than a fearsome beast. The escape scene from the clutches of the goblins that went on about ten times longer than necessary and included some just silly, over the top action scenes that were mediocre rehashes of the escape from Moria in the Fellowship of the Ring. The treeing of the dwarves by the goblins that devolved into a cheesy showdown between Thorin and the pale orc. Etc. Etc.The whole thing was almost palpably painful. The few redeeming parts, like the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum, we not nearly enough to make up for the clumsy, drawn out, ""cheap thrill"" nature of the rest of the movie. The dwarves looked ridiculous, the wargs were a downgrade from LOTR. I would prefer they start all over with a new film and cast new actors (other than Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo who was decent), better to wait five years for a decent film than to roll out parts 2 and 3 from a movie that was already too long in the first installment.The next two films are still pending. I am hoping that the production team can fix whatever fiasco happened with the interminably long first movie. Perhaps Smaug will be impressive enough to make up for. Maybe the final battle will be more than CGI silliness. We will see. I know this for certain, unless the reviews are over the top positive for The Hobbit, Part Deux, we will again wait for the DVD and this time we will rent it from Redbox rather than buying it.",2,The

I will not address that whole aspect of the chatter about this film because I believe it is both incorrect and inappropriate. Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings sought to take a humongous novel and reduce it to three three-hour films (+/-). To the extent that Jackson's accomplishment, visually, is stunning and an unrivaled technical marvel is, by now, beyond question. However, given that Tolkein's accomplishment is primarily linguistic in nature, Jackson and his writers chose to chop most of that language out of the book, and substitute a grand sequence of visual set pieces. For all my admiration of the visual accomplishment, it has always bothered me significantly that in replacing Tolkein's language with an endless series of dialogue fragments that the whole point of the work was essentially lost - or disfigured beyond recognition. One marvels at the technical accomplishment - but at the same time, becomes weary and shell shocked at the unending, relentless battles, blood-and-guts gore almost exactly as Howard Shore's wall-to-wall score creates unforgivable aural fatigue.I say all this to point now to Jackson's rendition of The Hobbit. Here, Tolkein's exquisite detail has been given the time to be presented much more completely - and when, for example, one comes to the riddle scene, it is very rewarding to see it presented in full sentences, and without simplistic textual redactions. Howard Shore's score is, regrettably, still wall-to-wall - and very annoying at that, and for the same reasons as above.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, as a film, seems to me just about right in all its aspects - especially when compared to the reductio-ad-absurdam of Jackson's LOTR trilogy, even its its ""extended"" versions. The argument that the original novel was a slim, short work, and that Jackson's adaptation is far too dark is absurd on its face. There is plenty of humor here - but the truth is that many of the episodes in the book which Tolkein describes only in general terms (and which would be fleshed out later in LOTR) are given the full, forward looking treatment - and deservedly so. By incorporating other, directly relevant materials from the rest of the LOTR cycle, Jackson has taken Tolkein's ""sketch"" and fleshed it out. It is altogether a satisfying rendition of the novel - whose 163 minutes fly by rather quickly.

1448435,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0059XTU1S,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","Many years ago, the dwarves of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, were driven from their home by Smaug, last of the great dragons. Thorin Oakenshield, the grandson of the last King of Erebor, has vowed to reclaim his home and called upon the dwarven clans of Middle-earth to aid him. Rebuffed, he instead plans a daring raid of a few chosen dwarves to slay Smaug whilst he sleeps. To aid them, Gandalf the Grey has promised to recruit a skilled burglar: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire. Their journey will take them through forests and caverns, all the while being tracked by an old enemy of Thorin's...An Unexpected Journey is the first movie in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit. That's Tolkien's short novel which, by word-count, is just under a fifth of the length of The Lord of the Rings. There's been enormous controversy about director Peter Jackson's decision to split The Hobbit into three three-hour films, with a fear that there simply isn't enough story to warrant it and this will result in padding. That is the threat that constantly hangs over the film and to be fair, it mostly avoids it by making a major change: Jackson has decided to show in full Gandalf and the White Council's side-story to confront and destroy the 'Necromancer' of Dol Guldur (a storyline that takes place off-page in the novel). Whilst also controversial amongst fans, it does give Jackson a rich vein of story to mine to add to proceedings, but how successful this will be remains to be seen (this subplot is only really started in the film).The movie opens with the older Bilbo (still played by Ian Holm) writing an account of his adventure for Frodo and narrating the destruction of the human town of Dale and the neighbouring dwarven mountain-city of Erebor by Smaug. We then have the traditional opening from the novel, with thirteen dwarves and the wizard Gandalf turning up on Bilbo Baggins's doorstep to recruit him for an adventure. By the time the young Bilbo (Martin Freeman) agrees to join the quest, a rather surprising forty minutes has passed. This sequence risks interminability, but Jackson takes advantage of the time to introduce the thirteen dwarves and give them some character traits missing from the source material. James Nesbitt's Bifur in the somewhat cynical joker of the pack, whilst Fili and Kili are the over-eager young guns out to impress their older peers. Dwalin is the bruiser and Balin the wise old - and somewhat pedantic - sage of the group (Ken Stott is excellent in the role). Bombur is fat and little more than that. The real impact is made at this stage by Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. Armitage is charismatic and has steely resolve and presence in his role, and is the standout performance of the movie (and, dare I say it, impresses more than even Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in the original trilogy).As well as showing the Necromancer stuff on-screen, Jackson has made some other changes to the story to increase the dramatic weight of events. Thorin now has his own nemesis, a mighty orcish warrior whose arm he cut off in battle. This warrior, long-thought dead, has returned and is now chasing down Thorin and his band (a bit like Lurtz in the movie version of Fellowship of the Ring, but a lot smarter and more continuously present). It's another change that I think some won't like, but as a dramatic device it worked fairly well at introducing some tension to the film. However, what was really distracting is that this orc has the exact same skin tone and texture as the Engineers in Prometheus and is likewise gigantic. His story arc is left unfinished at the end of the film, so we can assume he will return in the sequel (rather cleverly, as it provides a potentially better way of explaining a subplot in that film than Tolkien was able to do in the book).Elsewhere the film feels a lack of cohesion: the Necromancer plot has little to do immediately with Thorin's quest, so every time we cut away to Radagast the Brown (a great performance by the ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy) trying to resuscitate hedgehogs (!) or Gandalf discussing backplot with Saruman and Galadriel for what feel like nineteen hours, the movie flags. In fact, the dwarves get so bored of Rivendell (missed opportunity: someone saying, ""On second thoughts, let's not go to Rivendell. 'Tis a silly place,"") they just up and randomly leave. Once the dwarves are back on the road together and causing mayhem, the film perks up and more fun is had, even if sometimes accompanied by some unconvincing CGI.The scenes in the goblin caves in the Misty Mountains are entertaining, but also daft. Barrie Humphries as the Goblin King works rather better than most were likely expecting (and there's a humourous nod to Gandalf's ""You shall not pass!"" moment from the original trilogy), but the extended battle-and-escape sequence is too slapstick to really present much tension. This contrasts to the successful scene where Bilbo meets Gollum (Andy Serkis, on fire as always) and acquires the Ring, which is brilliantly acted by both parties and features some nice tonal variations from comedy to menace and back again.Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (***) can be called a qualified success. It has some big problems that Jackson has not been able to overcome: the storyline is too slight to sustain three hours and even with the addition of extra storylines and characters, there are some scenes which feel like wheel-spinning for the sake of it (most notably at Rivendell). There is also a near-omnipresent use of CGI in almost every scene of the movie. The original trilogy worked best when the camera was allowed to film natural landscapes or when miniatures were used to depict locations and give them a sense of reality and weight. Here, CGI is much more freely employed, often with less regard for hiding the fact it is CGI. In particular, there is a dearth of truly awesome shots of the countryside of New Zealand in all its glory compared to the original trilogy: here, even many of the landscape shots have been bathed in CGI until they glow with lens-flare. Even in 2D and at 24fps, the film has a 'faker' sheen across it than the original films, which sometimes distracts.Fortunately, Peter Jackson has learned from the mistakes of George Lucas and has remembered to include plenty of character moments to keep things more real. Armitage is awesome, as previously mentioned, but it's Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo which anchors the movie. His character arc (and Thorin's, which develops in tandem) is well-handled and Freeman nails this icon in a way he didn't manage with Arthur Dent (in the disappointing Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie). These character and thematic moments are less-successfully handled than in the original trilogy, but still give the film some dramatic weight and tension that keeps things interesting.",4,"A qualified

1448436,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B0059XTU1S,A. White,"[1, 1]","Being a long-time Tolkien fan I am well aware where the powers that be took some artistic liberties with this story, and can fully understand some of the criticisms of this particular film, but those didn't ruin the experience for me in the least; in fact, I was fine with many of the changes. As is usually the case with book-to-movie adaptations, changes from the source material were to be expected, but I couldn't say that all of them made sense both story-wise and necessity. Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a trilogy about the singlular story called There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale and it is presented in the awe-inspiring Peter Jackson format.While I agree with those who feel a trilogy of 3-hour movies was not necessary for this one story, as an obvious money-grab, I very much appreciated the depth given to the Dwarves' plight with Smaug and some of the additions through use of the appendices and Silmarillion. What I personally didn't care for was a few unnecessary changes to the dialog, particularly during the Troll scene and riddle game with Gollum, and the addition of Azog, with his followers attacking in the daylight no less. The pale orc's entire purpose was a very weak plot point IMO, to wipe out the line of Durin. Thorin is the last one in that family line and he's a poor nomad, so the footnote character's addition would be more putting him out of his misery than some vague desire for revenge. Why PJ et al decided to use a dead character instead of Azog's son, Bolg, who will make an appearance later anyway, is beyond me; plus avenging your father's death is a much better rationale for diverting from the source material. I also felt a few scenes looked a bit cartoonish, such as with the trolls and goblins, more so than with LotR. Overall though, the visuals, score, and writing were excellent and fairly seamless.As far as the actual product goes; it's that those who are still primarily using DVDs were remembered in regards to extras, but it still isn't very consistent. There's no reason why DVD and BR can't have the same special features, at least for the most part. However, in the collection of video blogs, provided in the special features, I found it amusing that until around the last 15 minutes (of more than 2 hours) they were talking about only 2 movies and showing us scenes that will be in the second film, since it wasn't approved to become a trilogy until late July 2012. In regards to the added 13 minutes for the extended edition, as it often happens with these things, I'm left wondering why some were edited out and other parts remained. Frankly, I felt around thirty minutes of the theatrical version could've been cut to not only `trim the fat' as it were, but also make the extended edition a more worthwhile product. There were a few gems in those 13 extra minutes, such as the song at Rivendell, but if you already have the regular version I'd recommend trying to catch the clips online before purchasing it to see if it suits your fancy.",4,Updated For Extended Edition,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,3020,"['Being', 'long-time', 'Tolkien', 'fan', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'where', 'powers', 'be', 'took', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'story', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'criticisms', 'particular', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'experience', 'least', 'fact', 'was', 'fine', 'many', 'changes', 'usually', 'case', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'changes', 'source', 'material', 'were', 'be', 'expected', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'made', 'sense', 'story-wise', 'necessity', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'first', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'singlular', 'story', 'called', 'Back', 'Again', 'Hobbit', 'Tale', 'presented', 'awe-inspiring', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'format.While', 'agree', 'who', 'feel', 'trilogy', '3-hour', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'one', 'story', 'obvious', 'money-grab', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'depth', 'given', 'Dwarves', 'plight', 'Smaug', 'additions', 'use', 'appendices', 'Silmarillion', 'What', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'dialog', 'particularly', 'Troll', 'scene', 'riddle', 'game', 'Gollum', 'addition', 'Azog', 'followers', 'attacking', 'daylight', 'less', 'pale', 'orc', 'entire', 'purpose', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'plot', 'point', 'IMO', 'wipe', 'out', 'line', 'Durin', 'Thorin', 'last', 'one', 'family', 'line', 'poor', 'nomad', 'footnote', 'character', 'addition', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'putting', 'misery', 'vague', 'desire', 'revenge', 'Why', 'PJ', 'al', 'decided', 'use', 'dead', 'character', 'instead', 'Azog', 'son', 'Bolg', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'appearance', 'later', 'anyway', 'avenging', 'father', 'death', 'much', 'better', 'rationale', 'diverting', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'felt', 'few', 'scenes', 'looked', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'such', 'trolls', 'goblins', 'more', 'so', 'LotR', 'Overall', 'visuals', 'score', 'writing', 'were', 'excellent', 'fairly', 'seamless.As', 'far', 'actual', 'product', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'primarily', 'using', 'DVDs', 'were', 'remembered', 'regards', 'extras', 'still', ""n't"", 'very', 'consistent', 'reason', 'why', 'DVD', 'BR', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'special', 'features', 'least', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'collection', 'video', 'blogs', 'provided', 'special', 'features', 'found', 'amusing', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'were', 'talking', 'only', '2', 'movies', 'showing', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'second', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'approved', 'become', 'trilogy', 'late', 'July', '2012', 'regards', 'added', '13', 'minutes', 'extended', 'edition', 'often', 'things', ""'m"", 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'other', 'parts', 'remained', 'Frankly', 'felt', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'theatrical', 'version', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'not', 'only', 'trim', 'fat', 'were', 'also', 'make', 'extended', 'edition', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'product', 'were', 'few', 'gems', '13', 'extra', 'minutes', 'such', 'song', 'Rivendell', 'already', 'have', 'regular', 'version', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'trying', 'catch', 'clips', 'online', 'purchasing', 'see', 'suits', 'fancy']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Young,"[0, 0]","Although the film story diverges a little from the actual book, one can easily see (if one is a Tolkien devotee) why the divergences are included and how they fit so well.  Radagast is a brilliant character (he simply doesn't play a major part in the book) but he assists in creating the escape sequence that is necessary for the whole party to reach Rivendell.  Gollum's depiction is brilliant, and I was extremely pleased to see the small sequence in which Bilbo spares his life......it has far reaching consequences that only come to full fruition in the Lord of the Rings.  The eagle sequence is also cleverly done, even though it is not &#34;book accurate&#34;.  However, it cuts out a section of the book that has little place in the film and leaves the party at the appropriate point where they can then move towards Beorn's house.  While the Necromancer is only referred to obliquely in The Hobbit book, it is obvious that it is Sauron who is trying to rebuild his body and the advent of the sorceror King of Angmar is an equally important prelude to the Lord of the Rings.  It was clever to put the council meeting at Rivendell......this gets the main players into the action and ready for the next part in the last section where the White Council forces Sauron out of Dol Guldur.

Well the ones now anyone can even see from the trailers and clips for this new film are the ones that struck me first in the other films, namely: too many facial close-ups; too much zooming and panning, too much swooping  moving-crane or airborne camera always in perpetual movement; and too much close-miking or dubbing of Gandalf's voice which has him sounding as if he's muttering to himself, or as if we're meant to be 'hearing' his thoughts; and excessive use of the wide angle lens which distorts space and perspective. The tendency towards using too many close-ups means that we seldom get enough shots of figures in context which would allow for some impressive framing and contribute to a sense of atmosphere. The art direction is very poor, as it was in LOTR.As usual we have to put up with New Zealand instead of Tolkien's intended English landscape. The English countryside, landscape and atmosphere is a very important part of Tolkien's imagination and we've not enough here which can be mistaken for the real thing even in the earlier stages of the journey.Like all big budget action films these days it's all too much 'in your face', and surely it should be obvious that this is not the right visual style for 'The Hobbit' the book. These constant camera movements, sometimes violent, and the fast editing, are all very familiar anyway having been used increasingly for the last 20 years, but here they are really overdone. The almost continual movement here is no doubt the result of trying to get the max out of 3D - as is the number of times things come suddenly towards you and jump out of the frame. It's also obvious that the battles are overdone with far too many evil goblins against so few in the company of dwarves, resulting in the unbelievable, yet nauseating, slaughter of the many by the indestructible few.In addition much of it looks very artificial with the dwarves looking either like Disney cartoons brought to life or like good looking actors dressed up to look like romantic Vikings, or some such, and not dwarves at all - everyone seems to have too much make-up on. Still these things are perhaps not fatal to the final effect of the film because after all The Hobbit is not the sacred book that LOTR is, and this is going to be a big family movie. On the other hand Martin Freeman looks not much more like a Hobbit than the actors in LOTR did - for a start he's not fat enough and what's more he looks just like Martin Freeman. It seems to me this sort of casting alone condemns all the films to inevitable failure for the true Tolkien enthusiast, and this and they would have been better family films if an effort had been made to look for some fairly small unusual looking people to play the parts. In any case we certainly don't need to have recognisable actors like Ken Stott and James Nesbitt who obviously make suspension of disbelief impossible before we've started.This film and LOTR had no business with being about actors and acting and would have been better off with total unknowns in every part. And everyone knows that Bilbo looked something like a younger Paul Simon, don't they?And then there is the music. On the basis of the first trailer that became available it looked as though we were going to be subjected to the same old music all over again, which those of us who disliked it the first time around, finding it inappropriate in tone, style and scale, as well as poor in quality, would find even more intolerable to have to hear again. In fact IF this music was going to be repeated why would we want to see the film at all, if we know and love the book, or indeed the old 1968 BBC radio serial?It was always quite possible of course that different music would be used in the final post-production stage, as the music is often left till the very last, but even so given the same composer it was always going to be the same overblown all-purpose generic BIG film music that we hear all the time for any subject that isn't trying to be 'cool' and contemporary. And surely one of the worst things about the music in the case of the LOTR films was that the Hobbits in the Shire were given music with a strongly Irish flavour. Now even one of the Dwarves  has an unmistakable Irish accent. But why should we be surprised when it seems so often that any film maker setting out to make a film 'entertaining' also feels that he can forget any need to achieve a sense of reality (albeit what Tolkien called 'secondary reality') other than by means of costumes and CGIAnother trailer had some less identifiable music in the same generic style I have mentioned. This kind of soundtrack makes any sort of detachment - upon which enchantment depends - extremely difficult. And enchantment is a large part of what a 'secondary world' is all about (we have Tolkien's word for that).I also looked at a third trailer which had some different music based on the Gregorian chant melody of the Dwarve's song 'Far Over The Misty Mountains'. This was certainly an improvement, and although it was a very short trailer, I thought at least there was a chance this time that some of the music would retain just a little of the detachment of Gregorian Chant - and there is a good basis for this in some of Tolkien's comments about his own conception of the music.Sadly I now know, having heard all the music, that most of it is just the same stuff we were given in LOTR and which alone would have been enough to ruin the final effect of however good a film it might have been. But there is at least some more space in the texture in places so that, for example, sometimes we hear only horns. Since we are mostly spared the 'Fellowship Theme', and leaving aside the Hobbit music which is confined to the early parts, the worst of the music this time around is the music which uses a chorus where an effect of the sublime is aimed for. It's identical to the music in LOTR and countless other films where it is used in the same predictable way. Like the rest of the score it's film muzak and can be produced by the yard.I said that the music is in the wrong style anyway, but it's not that I don't love the late-Romantic style when it's done well as it used to be by John Williams, and he CAN do enchantment too, but even he wouldn't be right for LOTR or The Hobbit. What is needed I believe is something much more pared down, and that could be something more contemporary in terms of serious music (contemporary classical music if you will) or it could be something in the ancient manner like our medieval music, or the classical music of some other cultures. A blu-ray disc could even give us a choice - or no music at all.I do realize that most of what I have called faults are just the sort of thing the film industry now demands when it wants a huge box-office and marketing success to rival all the superhero films based on comics. This is why the current style of film music in action films, with all its heavy dependence on sudden physical shocks (produced by the new bass technology and 5.1 surround), is all of a piece with fast and constantly mobile camera movement in three dimensions and fast editing, and why the commercial film industry insists on so many close-ups.The frequent close-ups are also related to the close miking and dubbing of the voices as a strategy for the total immersion which is supposed to provide the maximum possible manipulation of the consumer. It can be appropriate for some subjects where the emphasis is on character and acting but it doesn't work for epic narratives like LOTR and I don't believe it will work for an equally extended three part Hobbit which, with otherwise good justification, is obviously intended to represent another part of the epic story of the Ring. Epic requires some distance, and so does enchantment.I strongly recommend everyone listens to the 1968 BBC radio serial of The Hobbit which has been available for some time on a CD set. It has a magic this film can't achieve, and the theme music and the Dwarves' song are just right. I also recommend its wonderfully idiosyncratic Gandalf. It has no great aspiration to the epic any more than did Tolkien's original book and is much more in keeping with its style. I have no objection to the the narrative being upscaled to the epic for this new film but for the reasons I have given I don't think has succeeded  much more than the LOTR films did. I am not recommending the BBC radio serial of LOTR from around 1982.But Gollum is still a wonder of at least one aspect of the film industry, and at least one way it has done Tolkien justice.",3,"Jackson has made  the same 'mistakes' he made with LOTR,",1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,8710,"['also', 'now', 'added', 'same', 'mistake', 'made', 'King', 'Kong', 'indulging', 'are',

I've read the book numerous times, own the at times ironically entertaining Rankin-Bass Hobbit cartoon and loved the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings movies. I even think that, especially in the Two Towers and Return of the King, they benefit from the extended edition.But the first movie in the Hobbit series is hurt, quite a bit, by the decision to stretch it into three movies. Was there more than would fit into one movie? Probably; the stuff with the Necromancer was pretty crucial to explain where Gandalf kept going to, and the visuals of Erebor are great for explaining the importance of the journey to the dwarves.But the degree to which this has been stretched and padded goes beyond just including crucial information and creating three separate narrative arcs so that the movies, in theory, can each stand on their own for viewers. The movie dawdles far too long in Rivendell, there's way too much time spent in Erebor and way more time spent with Radagast (who's better in subsequent viewings than I thought originally, although he's not nearly as charming as Jackson seems to think he is). Trimming each of those back by half would make for a much more sprightly film.I own the Lord of the Rings movies in far too many formats, but I don't foresee picking up more than just the one DVD for each of the Hobbit films.

1448466,ADTGWOXJWWAY7,B0059XTU1S,Ben Franklin,"[15, 37]","First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books.  Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not.  It really is a bad movie by design.  Choices were made to add slapstick comedy at virtually every opportunity, to fabricate added story lines which bloat, rather than add, to the story, and quite simply to stray from the book liberally to appeal to a young demographic.  The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success (commercial and critical) of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.Too often scenes from the book have been altered to please young audiences with slapstick/gore/action or fabricated entirely.  Radagast, for example, who was mentioned in name only in the book, appears in the movie as something of an idiot wizard riding a sleigh powered by eight tiny... bunnies.  I'm not kidding.  This is perhaps the worst example of how Peter Jackson has botched the story and put the LOTR movie franchise at risk of ruin, presumably to appeal to a younger crowd, stretch it into 3 movies, and make more money.  There are many other example of this, which  cause you to leave Tolkien's world and wonder why the story was cheapened and botched at the hands of a director who did so well with the LOTR trilogy.I didn't mind fleshing out the 'necromancer' story line that was only hinted at in the book.  But on the other hand I thought the 'unexpected party' scene, the troll scene and the 'riddles in the dark' scene and the 'out of the frying pan...' scenes- the best scenes in the first part of the book- were all disappointing, having been altered for the worse.  The Azog vs. Thorin story line, a fabrication bloating the movie to add some gore/action and give Thorin a nemesis to overcome, was also uncompelling.  I didn't care for the replacement of the goblin tunnels in the book with essentially the orc pits under Isengard, or having the dwarves fall through a trap door and down a long fanciful shoot to the goblin pits rather than have the goblins emerge through a crack in the cave, as was the case in the book.  The battle scenes thereafter are almost entirely slapstick gore, with a mixture of characters falling hundreds of feet onto rocks completely unscathed.Lastly, I don't like how they changed the character of Bilbo Baggins.  In the book, Bilbo (and the dwarves for that matter) are basically out-matched and scared when the meet up with each of the foes in the first part of the book.  Bilbo, after reluctantly joining the group, is basically scared and miserable the whole first part of the book.  In the movie, Bilbo is portrayed more as a home-body who'd just rather be at home, but not terribly scared of trolls or orcs or goblins or dragons, they're just not really his cup of tea.  And the somewhat fabricated theme toward the end of Bilbo deciding to help the dwarves 'find their home' and help them get their home back is another disappointing alteration.There are many smaller details of the movie that also work to cheapen it, but I think you get the picture.  The only reason for 2-stars instead of 1-star is the production values, which are as good as the original LOTR trilogy.  The movie is nominated for a makeup and production design Academy Awards, but a telling comparison with the LOTR trilogy is the absence of any nominations for writing or direction or picture.  Both 'Fellowship' & 'Return' won best adapted screenplay, and were nominated for Best Picture ('Return' won).  The Hobbit could be nominated for worst-adapted screenplay- and seems was a conscious, if incredibly poor, choice by the writers and director- who did so well adapting LOTR to the screen.Equally disappointing is what might have been.  Instead of adding superfluous story lines, they could have made The Hobbit much smaller in scale compared to LOTR (which it is) and more personal.  Instead of starting with a Bilbo that is something of a home-body and not into adventures, they could have started with a Bilbo who secretly always wanted to go on an adventure- but was too afraid and too conforming to society to do so- until Gandalf pushed him along (in the book Bilbo was always into maps, etc. which is meant to suggest this).  From there, they could have portrayed the company of dwarves as serious and determined in their purpose, but totally unprepared for, and unknowing of, the challenges that awaited them.  There could have also been some focus on how miserable Bilbo was in the conditions- the mud, no food, and longing for home- and the friction and disrespect for him by most of the dwarves.  They might have also included how the elves made fun of them when they arrived in Rivendell, and Gandalf's own disdain for many of their failings, and that their adventure isn't his main concern.  Adding a troll scene that was true to the book, this would take about 50 minutes of compelling movie time as Act I.Act II could have started with the company entering the mountains and the cave scene.  Instead of having them fall hundreds of feet unscathed through a trap door unscathed, followed by an hour of slapstick gore battle sequences, they could have had the goblins catch them in the cave, and bring them chained through the tight confines of the dark tunnels in the book, rather than the expansive open pits in the movie.  Being faithful to the book in this case would have led to more suspense and terror- like when the Black Riders first appeared in 'Fellowship'- rather than the slapstick battle scenes that actually took place.  That would have set the stage for Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, and a more tense, drawn-out riddle scene where Bilbo is more at risk and Gollum in control.  After a tense escape scene through the dark, confined tunnels, and the relief at finally getting outside- once again finding themselves out-matched by the goblins and wargs as they find themselves trapped a top burning pine trees (as in the book), only to be saved once again- this time by the eagles.  This would put the movie time up to around 110 minutes, instead of nearly 3 hours, and get the movie to the same place in the book.  Expanding the 'necromancer' story line (which I thought was a worthwhile link to LOTR) might add some time and make it about a 2 hour movie, with still plenty of plot for an additional 2 hour finale.As it was, I came away thinking of a line that Gandalf used after recounting the story of Bullroarer Took to Bilbo early in the movie, and how he heaved off a goblin's head and it went 100 yards into a rabbit hole, winning the battle and inventing the game of golf at the same time.  When Bilbo replied ""you made that up"" Gandalf replied, ""all good stories have some embellishments.""  Perhaps this line served as a bad excuse for what was to follow.  The Hobbit already was a good fantasy story, as time has proven.  It didn't need embellishments.  Especially of the slapstick comedy variety that cheapen the story to appeal to 12 year olds.  It's too bad Peter Jackson couldn't leave well enough alone- to the ruin of the LOTR movie franchise.  I can't say I care to see this movie again, nor buy the disc, nor I am eagerly awaiting the next sequel if it is a botched as this one.  I hope Peter Jackson & Co. will do some serious re-work to their concept of The Hobbit, including re-shooting and re-editing many scenes in this film.",2,Strays from the book...and cheapens the

Watch and find out.This is the beginning of ""There and back again"" not worth viewing until you have the complete story in hand.The story starts off with a token view of our original beloved characters by the original actors. An observation is that the story starts out excruciatingly slow and takes a good chunk of time to get off the ground. Yet this may be on purpose as with any movies it is best to introduce the characters about to take the journey and their Hobbits... Oops their habits.For people that are interested in technology as much as the story presented it may be premature to purchase anything for a while until all the different versions are sorted out. We already have Blu-ray and digital. And by the time you find this review probably 3D so we can watch a lame rabbit sled. Then there is the denser version of Blur-ray, probably another try of smell-o-vision, seat bottom vibrations, interactive-conversations, etc.Avoid using rental services as they are using the crippled (missing all the DVD extras) rental version of the DVD.I can easily go two ways on this presentation. First it tries to fit the general feel of the LOTR movies and the ""Hobbit"" book which is really different in character. So this is more of a LOTR prequel.Having a lot of the same actors helped with consistency, as always we must have new actors; yet that splits the viewers into the two camps of one's following the story and the other's saying this is not the same actors (good or bad).

Tolkien wrote an amazingly complex piece in both the &#34;Hobbit&#34; and the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;. Here, we see MiddleEarth for the first time and while the movie did take some &#34;poetic license&#34; from the written story, it remained true to the heart of the work. Here, we find the Dwarves as strong characters, not as mere silly shrunken people in a simple fairy tale and Thorin Oakenshield is a character one could aspire to emulate, even with his stubborn faults. While we have yet to see the Dragon, the backstory of Erebor showed that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the next film. The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum was classic showing Gollum as the dangerous creature he truly was. While the Goblins were a bit cartoonish in some ways, I tended to view them as a slightly different species similar and allied to Orcs, granting them the lisence Jackson was seeking.

But if you read the book before viewing this waste of time film it might help you understand what some of us are trying to saying.It's a wonderful experience when a film stays close to the book that it was taken from. Jackson did a very good job with the Lord of the Rings trilogy but there is so much padding in this film that it's barely recognizable.In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film this film just went off line. The believably in the characters was not there for me in this first part of the Hobbit. Unlike the LOR movies that felt like a family film this film lost my attention making me go back and read the Hobbit again since my memories of the book where that it was a book for all ages and this film felt like a children's movie.Our taste in music art and film is of course subjective, but at this point I'm very disappointed with every release of the Hobbit in film done to this point .I also have to wonder how and why Jackson would take a single book, in fact the shortest book of this series and stretch it into a trilogy. If we are lucky Jackson will do something to rectify this when these three films are released to Blue-Ray and DVD.

1448518,AZJPMVXRCBWII,B0059XTU1S,BostonBoy,"[8, 13]","Let me start by saying that I'm a big Tolkien buff and that I went into this experience very apprehensive given the liberties Jackson took with the LOTR movies, that as a purist did not sit well with me. Why omit perfectly good material (old forrest, barrow downs, etc) and make up new material that is only introduced to make up an action beat and shake things up (Aragorns little Warg detour in the second movie as well as Frodos visit to Pelargrir come to mind) but I digress...Of course Jackson added material here as well, the difference is; it wasn't specifically already introduced by Tolkien differently (or if it was the changes were more forgivable and served the story better, I.e Azog as a villain) It's believable and it allowed Jackson creative freedom w/o interrupting the flow of the book. I.e. if a scene was described in the book the movie usually followed that fairly closely, the new material was introduced using the annals of the LOTR and only hinted in 'the hobbit', which in my opinion was a genius move to lift a fairly light hearted book into a somewhat darker and more interesting realm of middle earth (considering Tolkien wrote this before the LOTR as a story to read to his children and not as a prequel to LOTR per se).I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and for me the 3 hrs flew by ending a logical closure point at the Carrock. I watched it in HFR 3D and quite frankly I have no idea why professional critics knock this new format. The picture quality was amazing, the slight headache I usually experience after a long 3D movie was a no show and the experience was immersive, it felt like you lean out of your window and watch middle earth pass by below you, absolutely breathtaking and the visuals alone would be reason enough to watch it again.For me it was a rare true 5 star experience, that I'm planning on repeating in a few weeks...",5,"Good, detailed and smart adaptation of Tolkiens work",1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,1888,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'big', 'Tolkien', 'buff', 'went', 'experience', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'given', 'liberties', 'Jackson', 'took', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'purist', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Why', 'omit', 'perfectly', 'good', 'material', 'old', 'forrest', 'barrow', 'downs', 'etc', 'make', 'up', 'new', 'material', 'only', 'introduced', 'make', 'up', 'action', 'beat', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'Aragorns', 'little', 'Warg', 'detour', 'second', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Frodos', 'visit', 'Pelargrir', 'come', 'mind', 'digress', 'course', 'Jackson', 'added', 'material', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'difference', 'was', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'already', 'introduced', 'Tolkien', 'differently', 'was', 'changes', 'were', 'more', 'forgivable', 'served', 'story', 'better', 'I.e', 'Azog', 'villain', 'believable', 'allowed', 'Jackson', 'creative', 'freedom', 'w/o', 'interrupting', 'flow', 'book', 'I.e', 'scene', 'was', 'described', 'book', 'movie', 'usually', 'followed', 'fairly', 'closely', 'new', 'material', 'was', 'introduced', 'using', 'annals', 'LOTR', 'only', 'hinted', ""'the"", 'hobbit', 'opinion', 'was', 'genius', 'move', 'lift', 'fairly', 'light', 'hearted', 'book', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'more', 'interesting', 'realm', 'middle', 'earth', 'considering', 'Tolkien', 'wrote', 'LOTR', 'story', 'read', 'children', 'not', 'prequel', 'LOTR', 'se', '.I', 'found', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'experience', '3', 'hrs', 'flew', 'ending', 'logical', 'closure', 'point', 'Carrock', 'watched', 'HFR', '3D', 'quite', 'frankly', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'professional', 'critics', 'knock', 'new', 'format', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'amazing', 'slight', 'headache', 'usually', 'experience', 'long', '3D', 'movie', 'was', 'show', 'experience', 'was', 'immersive', 'felt', 'lean', 'window', 'watch', 'middle', 'earth', 'pass', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'visuals', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'was', 'rare', 'true', '5', 'star', 'experience', ""'m"", 'planning', 'repeating', 'few', 'weeks']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

It was a lot of fun to watch a story I read as a child coming to life on the screen. I especially enjoyed the singing. Tolkien wrote music to go along with the book, but how would we ever have heard it if it were't included in the film? I mention this because I saw a review complaining about this aspect of the film and calling it a musical. I like that there were humorous elements added to the movie. I like it even more that the humor didn't overpower the seriousness of the story.Least favorite scenes: 1) While the fighting rock giants were cool to watch, the scene felt like it had been slipped in at the last moment for the wow factor. There was no lead-up. The viewer is just suddenly thrown into the action. 2) The big bird thing again. So predictable.Favorite scenes: The dwarf dinner party.

1448522,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0059XTU1S,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","You won't be surprised to find out that things look much as they did in Lord of the Rings. You'll recognize the peaceful, scenic Shire and Bilbo's burrow. McKellen comes across as ageless in the role of Gandalf, looking for all the world as he did as Gandalf the Grey in Fellowship. As the movie progresses, the dramatic landscapes of New Zealand will also be familiar, as the adventurers travel far to reach the ancient Dwarven home, Eredor ... now known as the Lonely Mountain.For any who don't know, the set up for ""The Hobbit"" is thus: Decades ago a dragon chased the dwarves out of their prosperous mountain home. With the dragon not having been seen in 60 years, a group of dwarves including the heir to their throne decide the time is right to check out the ancestral city. Gandalf decides they are correct to do so. He enlists Bilbo, a hobbit, to be their ""burglar"" for the expedition. His reasons for this unusual choice are explained as you watch the film.I haven't read the book in a long time, and I don't want to provide spoilers, but if there were any details left out from the part of the story told in Unexpected Journey, I'd be surprised. We're going to have 8 to 9 hours devoted to the telling of ""The Hobbit"", which isn't nearly as expansive a tale as the Lord of the Rings books. The filmmakers allowed the story to take great patience with teaching us the history and introducing various characters.The CGI is just as seamless as in the Lord of the Rings. Your suspension of disbelief whether a troll, orc, worg, or goblin is in your face will be complete. The action scenes are lavish, extended, and frenetic. In fact they were maybe a touch too frenetic, making for some very large differences between the very slow pacing of establishing scenes and the frantic action of the battles.The movie goes to great lengths to try to satisfy everyone, from purist fans of the books to a general public who may know nothing about ""The Hobbit"" other than it is a ""prequel"" to Lord of the Rings. It may do a little TOO much to fill all plates. A dwarven song near the beginning of the movie was enough of a lullaby to have me nodding before it was done. LOL The riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum possibly was too generously paced. It is a bit like you are getting the ""extended version"" right from the start with this film.There are some terrifying sequences here, and those scenes may not be suitable for young children. Orcs are just as unattractive in this film as in Lord of the Rings, and the close ups of goblins, especially the Goblin King, might be enough to make some just a bit queasy.These are small quibbles. This is one impressive movie. It will grab your attention and keep it (unless the dwarves put you to sleep with their lullaby and no one pokes you to wake you back up!). The character building, with its relaxed pace, gives you a real sense of getting to know most of the dwarves, along with Galdalf and Bilbo. There is a very strong growth of character in this film for Bilbo, and in his relationship with his unexpected traveling companions.You were going to go see this film anyway, but for the record ...Highly recommended.",5,"Spectacular, but with a caveat or two",1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,3162,"['wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'look', 'much', 'did', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'peaceful', 'scenic', 'Shire', 'Bilbo', 'burrow', 'McKellen', 'ageless', 'role', 'Gandalf', 'looking', 'world', 'did', 'Gandalf', 'Grey', 'Fellowship', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'landscapes', 'New', 'Zealand', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'familiar', 'adventurers', 'travel', 'far', 'reach', 'ancient', 'Dwarven', 'home', 'Eredor', 'now', 'known', 'Lonely', 'Mountain.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'set', 'up', 'Hobbit', 'thus', 'Decades', 'dragon', 'chased', 'dwarves', 'prosperous', 'mountain', 'home', 'dragon', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'seen', '60', 'years', 'group', 'dwarves', 'including', 'heir', 'throne', 'time', 'right', 'check', 'out', 'ancestral', 'city', 'Gandalf', 'are', 'correct', 'do', 'so', 'Bilbo', 'hobbit', 'be', 'burglar', 'expedition', 'reasons', 'unusual', 'choice', 'are', 'explained', 'watch', 'film.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'provide', 'spoilers', 'were', 'details', 'left', 'out', 'part', 'story', 'told', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', '8', '9', 'hours', 'devoted', 'telling', 'Hobbit', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'expansive', 'tale', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'books', 'filmmakers', 'allowed', 'story', 'take', 'great', 'patience', 'teaching', 'history', 'introducing', 'various', 'characters.The', 'CGI', 'just', 'as', 'seamless', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'troll', 'orc', 'worg', 'goblin', 'face', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'lavish', 'extended', 'frenetic', 'fact', 'were', 'maybe', 'touch', 'too', 'frenetic', 'making', 'very', 'large', 'differences', 'very', 'slow', 'pacing', 'establishing', 'scenes', 'frantic', 'action', 'battles.The', 'movie', 'great', 'lengths', 'try', 'satisfy', 'everyone', 'purist', 'fans', 'books', 'general', 'public', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'nothing', 'Hobbit', 'other', 'prequel', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'may', 'do', 'little', 'TOO', 'much', 'fill', 'plates', 'dwarven', 'song', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'lullaby', 'have', 'nodding', 'was', 'done', 'LOL', 'riddle', 'game', 'Bilbo', 'Gollum', 'possibly', 'was', 'too', 'generously', 'paced', 'bit', 'are', 'getting', 'extended', 'version', 'right', 'start', 'are', 'terrifying', 'sequences', 'here', 'scenes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'Orcs', 'are', 'just', 'unattractive', 'film', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'close', 'ups', 'goblins', 'especially', 'Goblin', 'King', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'just', 'bit', 'queasy.These', 'are', 'small', 'quibbles', 'one', 'impressive', 'movie', 'will', 'grab', 'attention', 'keep', 'dwarves', 'put', 'sleep', 'lullaby', 'one', 'wake', 'back', 'up', 'character', 'building', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'real', 'sense', 'getting', 'know', 'most', 'dwarves', 'Galdalf', 'Bilbo', 'very', 'strong', 'growth', 'character', 'film', 'Bilbo', 'relationship', 'unexpected', 'traveling', 'companions.You', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'anyway', 'record', 'Highly', 'recommended']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448525,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B0059XTU1S,Brian C.,"[0, 3]","I should begin by saying that I was a huge fan of the original LOTR trilogy. I was already a fan of the books and the movies exceeded my expectations. I was also very excited when I heard that Peter Jackson was not only making The Hobbit, but that it was going to be a trilogy. I know some people complain about the length of these movies, but I get lost in these films like no others, so I could watch for hours, and I was looking forward to nine more hours of hobbit tales and adventure.The truth is, it would have been almost impossible for Peter Jackson to make a hobbit movie that I did not like. I have already bought into the whole world, and any trip to Middle Earth is going to be a trip that I enjoy. I just finished watching The Hobbit for the first time and I certainly enjoyed it. There are a lot things, I think, to enjoy in this movie. There are a whole host of new characters (all the dwarves), as well as a lot of returning characters. There is more background on the history of Middle Earth. There are, of course, lots of stunning visuals. I felt like all the actors did their jobs well. I was particularly pleased with Martin Freeman, who I very much enjoyed in the BBC Sherlock Holmes specials, as a young Bilbo Baggins. I think most of the die hard fans of the original trilogy will find a lot to enjoy here.That having been said, there did seem to me to be something missing from this film. It is something mysterious. Perhaps it is simply the lack of surprise. When I went to see The Fellowship of the Ring in theaters I had no idea what to expect, and I was blown away, and I felt like each successive movie managed to blow me away in a new way. Now, we pretty much know what to expect, and I feel like this movie, perhaps for that reason, did not have the same impact on me as the originals. I also felt like it was more difficult to differentiate between the dwarves. One of the things that made the original trilogy great was that each main character had a unique personality and it was great watching them interact. A few dwarves manage to stand out, but so far, they are sort of one giant collective character. That is not necessarily Peter Jackson's fault. He is just following the book, and in The Hobbit the companions are all dwarves, rather than one dwarf, one elf, two humans, one wizard, and four hobbits, but I think it might be one reason I was not as enthralled with this movie.Now, that having been said, Peter Jackson did set up some really interesting stuff for the next two movies. I was particularly pleased with the introduction of The Necromancer who promises to be an interesting foe. And, of course, Smaug will play more of a role in the other movies. I have a secret hope that Peter Jackson is going to find a way to fit Tom Bombadil into the trilogy, since he was left out of the original trilogy, but that is probably an unrealistic hope. There was, obviously, a lot of setting up to do in this movie, and that is probably another reason I was not as enthralled with this movie as I was with the original trilogy. Still, the movie held my interest, it felt great to be back in Middle Earth, and I am now eagerly awaiting the next installment...",4,A worthy prequel...,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,3195,"['should', 'begin', 'saying', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'was', 'already', 'fan', 'books', 'movies', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'trilogy', 'know', 'people', 'complain', 'length', 'movies', 'get', 'lost', 'films', 'others', 'could', 'watch', 'hours', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'nine', 'more', 'hours', 'hobbit', 'tales', 'adventure.The', 'truth', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'impossible', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'make', 'hobbit', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'already', 'bought', 'whole', 'world', 'trip', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'going', 'be', 'trip', 'enjoy', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Hobbit', 'first', 'time', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'think', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'are', 'whole', 'host', 'new', 'characters', 'dwarves', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'returning', 'characters', 'more', 'background', 'history', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'are', 'course', 'lots', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'felt', 'actors', 'did', 'jobs', 'well', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'BBC', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'specials', 'young', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'think', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'original', 'trilogy', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'here.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'film', 'something', 'mysterious', 'Perhaps', 'simply', 'lack', 'surprise', 'When', 'went', 'see', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'theaters', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'felt', 'successive', 'movie', 'managed', 'blow', 'away', 'new', 'way', 'Now', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'feel', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'impact', 'originals', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'difficult', 'differentiate', 'dwarves', 'One', 'things', 'made', 'original', 'trilogy', 'great', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'unique', 'personality', 'was', 'great', 'watching', 'interact', 'few', 'dwarves', 'manage', 'stand', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'sort', 'one', 'giant', 'collective', 'character', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'fault', 'just', 'following', 'book', 'Hobbit', 'companions', 'are', 'dwarves', 'rather', 'one', 'dwarf', 'one', 'elf', 'two', 'humans', 'one', 'wizard', 'four', 'hobbits', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'enthralled', 'movie.Now', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'did', 'set', 'up', 'really', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'next', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'introduction', 'Necromancer', 'who', 'be', 'interesting', 'foe', 'course', 'Smaug', 'will', 'play', 'more', 'role', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'secret', 'hope', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'going', 'find', 'way', 'fit', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'trilogy', 'was', 'left', 'original', 'trilogy', 'probably', 'unrealistic', 'hope', 'was', 'obviously', 'lot', 'setting', 'up', 'do', 'movie', 'probably', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'enthralled', 'movie', 'was', 'original', 'trilogy', 'Still', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'felt', 'great', 'be', 'back', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'am', 'now', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'next', 'installment']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

We want to buy the extended because the extra footage from LOTRs made LOTRs a better movie. This extended version of The Hobbit does not make it a better movie. It doesn't make it a bad movie. It's pretty much the same with 30 extra minutes. I did not feel the story was expanded in a better way and I did not feel the characters were explained in more detail. The pacing felt a little slower because of the extra 30 minutes. There is a lot more singing in this version, I will say that. It has two more musical numbers in it which makes that four songs in total. If you didn't read the book then the songs will mean nothing, but fans of the book will love more of the songs. It began to feel like a musical though.If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy the extended or the theatrical it all depends on if you don't mind watching 30 minutes more of this movie.If you already own the theatrical version I would recommend renting the extended first and seeing how you like it. I will recommend if you have a 3D TV or plan to get one in the future then get this version. The 3D is amazing. I actually like the 3D on the blu-ray more than I did in the theater.I had the other Blu-ray version of this movie which included the production diaries. This version does not include those. They do include many great documentaries on the production of the movie, but I miss having the production diaries. There are about 9 hours of documentaries. I had trouble getting back to the main menu of the features. Once I selected Play All I could not go back to the beginning from the remote.

The orcs hunt them in open fields on giant dogs. The orcs are led by, you guessed it, a taller slimmer orc. The trolls even have a short cameo. Gollum splashes around in a cave carrying on about his ring. The giant eagles rescue the Fellowship and fly them towards the mountain (why don't they just fly them the whole way??).

Peter Jackson, with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, brought us to a place that many thought wasn't possible except in the written form. A product of many of our childhoods, J.R.R. Tolkien constructed an elaborate world of wizards, trolls, elves, dwarves, humans and most importantly Hobbits. It is an elaborately detailed world of maps, homelands, stories and adventures. It couldn't possibly be realized anywhere close to what J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination did. Yet, Jackson pulled it off better than anyone could have hoped. Now, he's trying again.""The Hobbit"" is a step backward into the history of middle-earth. It is quite simply the adventure that Bilbo Baggins takes that leads to him writing his book, ""There and back again"". Peter Jackson is trying to do the unthinkable with this trilogy, duplicate the magic he pulled off before. Much can be told from this first installment and whether or not the magic is still there.The movie, filmed at twice frame-speed as traditional film (48 frames) has many geeks talking about how it will look too real. Ultimately, at 48 frames, it could look as crisp and real as a soap opera. Well, first of all, with a film like this, it takes a lot of guts to attempt such a thing; a movie with such obvious special effects and makeup. Yet, the opposite could also be achieved; a level of escapism and realism that not only delivers a quality movie experience, but also sucks you into a world that you don't want to leave.Peter Jackson has learned a few things from his first trilogy and you can see it in ""The Hobbit"".

I found The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey to be way overdone visually.  It was not the scenes that I felt were overdone, but the action.  Several parts of the action involved such fantastic escapes from death that they eventually got tiresome to me, because of the lack of any realism to them.  Examples include collapsing scaffolding, immediately followed by a huge goblin falling on the entire company; mountains fighting each other (""stone giants"") and every single member of the company being constantly on the edge of death but never quite falling; and a huge fight with orcs at the end which detracts from the story--the story is captivating in that there was no way for them to fight the orcs; they were completely helpless until the eagles arrived.  This movie, I felt like, tried to jam too much into an adventure, so that it didn't have the ""incidental"" enjoyment of the original story.  Instead of a set of interesting incidents like the book is, this seemed like one battle after another and like it was trying to fit in all the marginal events that go on in Middle Earth at the same time.  It wasn't nearly as enjoyable as I hoped it would be, for that reason.

Many decades before the recent film, &#34;the Hobbit&#34;, originally published by Allen and Unwin UK in 1937, ushered in the beginning of the quest fantasy genre of modern fantasy which has been copied many times since. And yet, Tolkien's original novel about a hobbit, a smallish humanoid living on the edges of a mythical world called &#34;Middle Earth&#34;, who by chance becomes the pivotal character of a quest among dwarfs, holds up surprisingly well even after 75 years.Peter Jackson has once again provided a mesmerizing screen adaption of one of Tolkien's most beloved tales. The look and feel of Middle Earth is equal to and possibly even better than Jackson's adaption of &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; ten years earlier. But even aside from the look and feel, the acting of the characters stands up well. Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, is the reluctant adventurer, a hobbit who would rather be smoking his pipe and perusing his books than outwitting trolls and goblins. Hobbits enjoy reading about adventure instead of actually engaging in adventure. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, the wise but eccentric wizard whose presence is the very face of Middle Earth. Richard Armitage plays Thorin, the displaced heir of the King Under the Mountain whose dwarven society was shattered by the dragon Smaug. The other dwarfs which make up the band of misfits all have their lovable eccentricities as Tolkien had forged them.While the story itself of a band of dwarfs seeking to reclaim their home and treasure which was plundered from them by the ominous dragon Smaug is quite well-known, some of the inspiration behind the story may be less well-known to most readers and movie-goers. Tolkien himself was raised in small medieval-like towns in the county of Worcestershire. These humble towns in the English countryside ring strikingly of Tolkien's Hobbiton. Both Bilbo Baggins and later Frodo Baggins will leave Hobbiton and become enmeshed in great epic quests and battles, somewhat similar to when Tolkein became a young man and entered into the epic conflict of World War I. These same themes on a grander scale will play out in &#34;the Lord of the Rings&#34;. Also, Tolkien was a scholar of medieval and Nordic mythology, and these stories were intended as a kind replacement for the lost English mythology and lore resulting from the Norman conquest of 1066.I think the main issue for movie-goers is whether or not one wants to revisit Middle Earth and hang out there for nearly three hours. If you do, then there are almost no shortcomings at all to &#34;the Hobbit&#34;. A few sequences went on a bit long, particularly when the dwarfs are taken hostage by Goblins, and other long-winded sequences in which the CGI effects are used ad infinitum. At the same time, the film is true to Tolkien's original vision. Jackson's intent I believe is to immerse the viewer into Middle Earth as if the audience is part of the quest along with Bilbo and the Dwarfs. Also, the scenes with the most ghoulish character Gollum, do not drag on too long. In all an absolute triumphant of high fantasy filmmaking. But if you're taste is not in the realm of fantasy of this type, it may be too much. All I can do is offer my condolences.",5,"If You Enjoy Revisiting Middle Earth, the Hobbit is Astonishing -- A Masterpiece of English Mythological",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,3462,"['Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'first', 'installment', 'projected', 'three-film', 'adaptation', 'JRR', 'Tolkien', '34', 'Hobbit', '34', 'first', 'fantasy', 'book', 'written', 'Tolkien', 'taking', 'place', 'mythical', '34', 'Middle', 'Earth', '34', 'Many', 'decades', 'recent', 'film', '34', 'Hobbit', '34', 'originally', 'published', 'Allen', 'Unwin', 'UK', '1937', 'ushered', 'beginning', 'quest', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'modern', 'fantasy', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'times', 'yet', 'Tolkien', 'original', 'novel', 'hobbit', 'smallish', 'humanoid', 'living', 'edges', 'mythical', 'world', 'called', '34', 'Middle', 'Earth', '34', 'who', 'chance', 'pivotal', 'character', 'quest', 'dwarfs', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'even', '75', 'years.Peter', 'Jackson', 'once', 'again', 'provided', 'mesmerizing', 'screen', 'adaption', 'one', 'Tolkien', 'most', 'beloved', 'tales', 'look', 'feel', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'equal', 'possibly', 'even', 'better', 'Jackson', 'adaption', '34', 'Lord', 'Rings', '34', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'even', 'aside', 'look', 'feel', 'acting', 'characters', 'up', 'well', 'Bilbo', 'played', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'reluctant', 'adventurer', 'hobbit', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'smoking', 'pipe', 'perusing', 'books', 'outwitting', 'trolls', 'goblins', 'Hobbits', 'reading', 'adventure', 'instead', 'actually', 'engaging', 'adventure', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Gandalf', 'wise', 'eccentric', 'wizard', 'presence', 'very', 'face', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Thorin', 'displaced', 'heir', 'King', 'Mountain', 'dwarven', 'society', 'was', 'shattered', 'dragon', 'Smaug', 'other', 'dwarfs', 'make', 'up', 'band', 'misfits', 'have', 'lovable', 'eccentricities', 'Tolkien', 'had', 'forged', 'story', 'band', 'dwarfs', 'seeking', 'reclaim', 'home', 'treasure', 'was', 'plundered', 'ominous', 'dragon', 'Smaug', 'quite', 'well-known', 'inspiration', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'well-known', 'most', 'readers', 'movie-goers', 'Tolkien', 'was', 'raised', 'small', 'medieval-like', 'towns', 'county', 'Worcestershire', 'humble', 'towns', 'English', 'countryside', 'ring', 'strikingly', 'Tolkien', 'Hobbiton', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'later', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', 'will', 'leave', 'Hobbiton', 'become', 'enmeshed', 'great', 'epic', 'quests', 'battles', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'when', 'Tolkein', 'became', 'young', 'man', 'entered', 'epic', 'conflict', 'World', 'War', 'same', 'themes', 'grander', 'scale', 'will', 'play', 'out', '34', 'Lord', 'Rings', '34', 'Also', 'Tolkien', 'was', 'scholar', 'medieval', 'Nordic', 'mythology', 'stories', 'were', 'intended', 'kind', 'replacement', 'lost', 'English', 'mythology', 'lore', 'resulting', 'Norman', 'conquest', '1066.I', 'think', 'main', 'issue', 'movie-goers', 'not', 'one', 'revisit', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'hang', 'out', 'there', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'do', 'then', 'are', 'almost', 'shortcomings', '34', 'Hobbit', '34', 'few', 'sequences', 'went', 'bit', 'long', 'particularly', 'when', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Goblins', 'other', 'long-winded', 'sequences', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'true', 'Tolkien', 'original', 'vision', 'Jackson', 'intent', 'believe', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'audience', 'part', 'quest', 'Bilbo', 'Dwarfs', 'Also', 'scenes', 'most', 'ghoulish', 'character', 'Gollum', 'do', 'not', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'absolute', 'triumphant', 'high', 'fantasy', 'filmmaking', ""'re"", 'taste', 'not', 'realm', 'fantasy', 'type', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'offer', 'condolences']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

I've read all the books, plowed through The Silimarillion and The Children of Hurin and everything else written by Tolkein including the awful Christmas book.  But the Hobbit is a fave of mine and I like what they did with the story when they made the movie.  Is it exact? No, but it is true to the nature of the book, the thread that runs through all the books and it's a little nice I must admit, to be surprised by the changes in the storyline.

1448642,AHMBRRDMGIFV3,B0059XTU1S,Conelius III,"[2, 4]","I wrote a review for the Hobbit 2: Where's Bilbo and forced myself to look at the reasoning behind why I hated it so much. This movie has its flaws though admittedly it is a vastly superior film to the second (though that isn't saying much).I want to start out by talking about what I actually did like about this film and then I'll offer up a shorter list of the problems with this film, especially within the extended edition.Though my previous review began with an extended summary of the movie I find I lack the energy required to do so for this movie and in many ways I lack the memory of what actually happened in this film.Many will say that this movie was too boring and that the second movie is vastly superior, do not listen to these people, they crave nothing but fast action and pretty things to look at. This movie is superior to the second for the simple reason that it was intended to end where it did and it didn't decide to flesh out certain aspects in order to add an unnecessary third film.What I liked about this film1) Gollum's cave: this was without a doubt the best part of the movie, Gollum was perfectly executed, the scene was tense and it didn't drag out, like the Smaug scene in part 2. Additionally Gollum once again remains the best bit of CGI in this series, even better than Smaug to be perfectly honest, with the performance behind him you can actually believe he's real for a few moments.2) The Misty Mountains song: this was almost perfectly executed and it really set up the culture of the dwarves and the fact that, though they may seem silly, they are the diaspora of the dwarves and are without a home.3) Christopher Lee's performance; this was one of the top things for me just because of how obvious it was that the poor man was in extreme pain, his straight back just showed and arthritic performance that sadly has to be the final film of an incredible career.4) Galadriel; somehow this film did not ruin Galadriel, Cate is actually more stunning here than in the first film and it is spectacular.Now for the more fun part, what I hated or disliked about this film1) The opening, I found this too similar to the opening in LoTR, though it gets a bit sillier in some respects, I was able to actually buy most of what was happening, and then a dwarf picks up a molten piece of metal with his bare hand and smashes it between two comically large hammers. This is problematic because it's silly and detracts from any realism that may have been built up in the opening.2)  The revealing of the Silmaril in the extended opening. This hurt me, this is something that should not be around, the silmarils are lost and that the dwarves somehow have one goes against so much of Tolkein's lore.3) Frodo's presence: I get it, we want to connect the two films but that this film is apparently just Bilbo writing of it is silly. I fully expect a scene in the third film where Frodo walks up, looks over Bilbo's shoulder and says &#34;Oh Bilbo, that's not how it happened.&#34;4) Azog the orc: listen to me. This orc should be dead, he died at Moria, it's his son that is following the party. I actually think that that would have made for a better story, maybe we see a different side of orc culture and we see an orc out for revenge for the death of his father, maybe make us actually relate to him for a second? A relatable villain, isn't that what we always want these days?5) Radagast the Narnian, suddenly this movie took a strange turn in which we're treated to goofy hedgehogs being protected by the Doctor (who is apparently high on Mushrooms) This was such a stupid interpretation of Radagast and it is an insult to everything the first films did as well as what Tolkien did. They wanted a character that appealed to the kiddies but if you have to do that by making him high I'm not sure if that actually is a good call.6) Gandalf's fear/irritation of Saruman: look at Fellowship. Look at Gandalf's and Saruman's relationship there, they are friends. Gandalf goes to Saruman and is clearly close with him, yet here we see Gandalf scared or annoyed of him. This is backsliding of characters and actually damages their relationship that was set up a decade ago.7) The line &#34;the legends are true! Giants! Stone Giants!&#34; This was so poorly delivered that it actually made the scene just seem like it was set up to show some rock 'em sock 'em robot fights. This scene would have been just as well executed if they never made mention of what they were but instead just had the battle and had the dwarves trying to survive.8) The Goblin King as presented in the extended edition: this character wasn't bad in the theatrical film, a little annoying and a little cartoony but still kind of fun and reminiscent of the book. In the extended edition though we are treated to a song (which I don't hate) which is ended by a fist pump (which is the worst). We are then treated to a &#34;made in Rivendale&#34; gag that is simply stupid and pulls you out of the film. These films should never make references to modern things and yet here we have a moment when the Goblin King essentially looks at the camera and winks, it detracts from the film and instead reminds you that you are in fact watching a film made &#34;for children&#34;9) Goblins/orcs: this is a nerdy one. Goblins and orcs are the same thing. Tolkien described the use of goblins as being a Hobbit language thing. Orcs is what men call them, there shouldn't be a difference between the two, especially in how they refer to themselves. I don't care if they look different but the language/names should be the same.10) The CGI chase scene through Goblin Town: This scene was stupid, we're treated to CGI characters running from CGI monsters that looks like a deleted scene from a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. This is followed by Gandalf facing down the Goblin King on a narrow bridge (like the Balrog, get it?) The bride breaks and they fall, this is stupid and shows the utter disregard for physics or survivability. The dwarves though land at the bottom safely, even after the Goblin King lands atop them.11) The overuse of CGI: This is the same issue I had with the second film. Jackson has lost himself, there was a time he would have done as much as possible with real effects, here though he seems to want to do as much with CGI as possible, even when the CGI looks awful. The wargs, the orcs, the goblins, the eagles, they all look terrible and only serve to pull any sense of realism from the film. Why is it that a film that came out a decade after LoTR and with a budget three times that of LoTR has CGI that looks worse than LoTR? I've seen what WETA can do. I've seen King Kong, I've seen District 9. For some reason this film's CGI looks awful, where did the money go? Did they have to rush the film? There's one interview that sticks in my mind on the extended edition. Jackson has a set of costumes made for the goblins that take the dwarves, however he soon decides he doesn't like them and instead converts them to CGI. I don't understand this mindset. Look at LoTR, despite the fact that almost all the orcs are costumes they look amazing. Jackson seems to have come to the conclusion that he can simply do it in CGI and call it good.Ultimately this is the first sign of what is wrong with the second film. Jackson is turning into George Lucas and is making the same mistakes he made with the prequel films (only with someone else's material, which is worse). I'm saddened by this, Jackson had so much potential but because of his sudden obsession with CGI and with getting these films done quickly has made it so what made the first films so good has been lost. Here we see a movie that is made for money alone. There is no real heart or passion in this film, it's apparent that few members of the cast have read the original material and it is apparent that Jackson has somehow been surrounded by yes men who won't question his decisions, even when they are terrible. I don't wand this to be the case but ultimately it is.This film is better than the second but that doesn't mean it's good. I am waiting for the end of this year just so we can see the end of this trilogy and we can let it fade into memory.",2,The Hobbit: An Unexpected FUBAR,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,8224,"['wrote',

First of all, you need to readThe Hobbit. Go buy it and read every page. Now everyone expected this to be hardcore dramatic action likeThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]....it's not because that's how it works. The Hobbit is a simple story, that's how Tolkien wrote it.  was the big epic he made after the simple story, of the Hobbit. But after waiting 9 years I can understand that expectations were very high, but no one took the time to calm down and go see it as a simple adventure.Now the movie itself follows theThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray] very well. The story is simple and follows along, like the book. There are a few bits in the film that are off from the book, but they mostly work well with the overall theme. The underlying theme is of course trusting Bilbo and knowing just how useful he really is. I overall love Andy's return as Gollum, though I think it was taken a little too comedic. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is great performance as it was in Lord of the Rings. Martin Freeman as Bilbo was a really good choice, he nailed it! I am looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug and to see the mighty dragon himself! The film is overall faithful to the book and a really good film.Now for the criticisms...It's too long? It's following Lord of the Rings! The theatrical cuts were 3 hours long and the extended cuts were 4 hours long....what did you expect??? Confusion....I heard this withPrometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)(an absolutely amazing film), if you're going to see a movie... PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS!!!!!! Also, don't be so closed minded, try to enjoy the film, not criticize!In closing this movie is really good, and Intend to but it and it's Extended Cut. I hope you enjoy as much as I have.

1448653,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0059XTU1S,C. Sawin,"[2, 6]","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first film in a new trilogy that takes place before ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Peter Jackson returns to direct and a few familiar faces also make the journey back to Middle-earth not only in ""An Unexpected Journey,"" but will be popping up throughout the three new films. Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis revisit the beloved Tolkien characters in this film alone and special effects are again handled by Weta Workshop and Weta Digital. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is set 60 years before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and follows a young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) as he's recruited by Gandalf (McKellen) to be a burglar of sorts and assist Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and 12 of his dwarf brethren as they set out on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain and retrieve it from the dragon Smaug so Thorin can finally become king.Seeing this in 3D and in 48 frames per second is incredibly different from the typical movie going experience. 48 frames per second takes some getting used to. Character movements and action sequences look sped up; almost like someone pressed fast forward on a VCR and forgot to press play. But then somebody starts talking and you realize that that is part of how it was filmed. Everything is just as rich in detail as you'd come to expect from these films, but it seems slightly enhanced compared to 9-11 years ago. It's not just because digital technology has improved since then either. Scenery looks like finely crafted paintings and simple things like the line of every stone, every strand of hair, and every thread of fabric is brought to life. These entities and these motions move and come to life in ways you never imagined.This may be the most efficient use of the 3D effect all year. Spit, broken teeth, and arrows all fly into your face as flaming pine cones are practically thrown into your lap. The feathers of the wings of giant birds seem to brush against your cheek. The special effects are outstanding and are as crisp and smooth as the most impressive video game cut scenes. Weta has always been a few steps ahead of the average special effects company with Industrial Light & Magic being a very close second, but Weta seems to have outdone themselves yet again. Animated characters are even smoother than they were in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" they're more fluid, and textures are more detailed. Everything is just more polished overall.The new technology mostly works to the prequel's benefit, but there are a few setbacks. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is incredibly slow for the first 45 minutes or so, especially when you have to sit through the dwarves eating all of Bilbo's food, throwing plates around, belching, smoking, and singing. There's little to settle into at first other than Ian McKellen slipping back into the Gandalf role with ease as his body language and a slight curl of his upper lip say more about the character than the things that came out of his mouth half of the time. Meanwhile, Martin Freeman brings a little lighthearted humor to the Bilbo role. Even with him being so humble, modest, soft-spoken, and completely gutless, he's still quite humorous as are his interactions with just about everyone. With the slow pace in the first quarter of the film though, the 48 frames per second doesn't really work all that well. Things not only look weird at first, but the intricate details seem to reveal too much. Most of the set pieces and costume designs are revealed in this light that has the film come off as a glorified version of ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" or ""Xena: Warrior Princess;"" that is until you get used to it and the film picks up.The epic fantasy adventure doesn't really pick up until Dwalin (Ken Stott) tells the story of the pale orc. Shortly after, the trolls are introduced who have this ""Three Stooges"" mentality to them, are simpletons, and argue about how to cook everything. The troll interactions with the dwarves and Bilbo is not only exciting, but fairly amusing as well. From there, they travel to Rivendell where you see some more familiar faces, get caught in the middle of a stone giant battle that is quite the spectacle, and are eventually lead underground and have some really impressive sequences with goblins. Bilbo gets separated from the group and interacts with Gollum. Andy Serkis is really at the top of his game because Gollum's facial expressions alone are extraordinary and the entire game of riddles sequence is really entertaining.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn't always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it's more reliable than anything. It's as if you have to let it roll downhill before starting the engine, as well. In other words, it may be a bit slow at first but be patient. The action is like a shy teenager at his first high school dance that has to warm up to everybody before finally loosening up. 48 frames per second is the same way as you eventually get used to it.""An Unexpected Journey"" is so similar to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" though. Maybe that's one of the reasons it felt so rough to get through large chunks of it. The next two films will apparently venture in different directions from the original trilogy (this is coming from someone who hasn't read the books), so it seems like the best is yet to come. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is definitely worth going all out for. See it in 3D and see it in 48 frames per second if you can just for the experience. The special effects are unbelievable and there are some extraordinary chase and battle sequences buried deep within some thick doses of tediousness, but ""An Unexpected Journey"" has this veil of monotony draped over it that it's never really able to shake. It's gorgeous in theaters, but it makes you wonder how it's going to translate to DVD and Blu-ray and its slow pace makes you wonder if repeat viewings might become somewhat of a burden.",4,A clumsy

Not only does he save Gandalf and the dwarfs in one incredibly brilliant move while driving a sled pulled by jackrabbits but he also fearlessly protects all life in his forest. As a solitary wizard, with only animals as his companions, he is literally a guardian angel. He is also on the front lines. Some mysterious evil force is invading his forest. He has real power and he's not afraid to use it to heal or repel evil! Tolkien was obviously an ardent environmentalist & conservationist and I'm so glad this version of The Hobbit makes that perfectly clear!One of my other favorite scenes is when Gandalf compares his approach to combating great evil with Saruman's. I'm paraphrasing here, but Gandalf believes to fight great evil it's an accumulation of small acts of kindness and the power of compassion that in the end will triumph over great evil. While Saruman believes only great power can defeat great evil. Gandalf and Saruman's approach to combating evil are as opposite as day is to night!

In this prequel, the first of three films, we accompany a band of dwarves, along with an unwilling Bilbo Baggins, on their journey to reclaim their homeland.On it's own, An Unexpected Journey is a majestic and fantastical tale that will be sure to please audiences of all ages. The action is thrilling and the story is full of humor and light-heartedness. The cinematography is everything you would expect from a Jackson film; sweeping landscapes, elaborate set pieces, and an incredible sense of grandeur. The film is incredibly fun and is a welcome return to Middle-Earth. Martin Freeman is terrific as our little hero, and I'm incredibly glad he was cast in the role. Each returning cast member reprises their role masterfully, particularly Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and the new actors fit into their roles quite nicely.However, for me, compared with the Lord of the Rings saga, The Hobbit didn't quite meet the expectations I had. Perhaps they were already impossibly high because of my love for the Rings trilogy, but the film just didn't give me the sense of shock and awe I was hoping for. The film's pace drags a bit, especially the first forty minutes or so, but I can't criticize that too much as there's a lot of backstory to cover and a lot of characters to introduce. Also, the movie is incredibly CGI intensive; almost to the point that it took me out of the movie. I understand there was a lot of CGI in the Rings films but this just felt a little over the top.It was great to get reacquainted with some of the characters I've come to love, particularly Gandalf and especially Gollum, who's game of riddles scene with Bilbo is easily the best in the film. I'm not entirely sold on Jackson's persistence on making three films, as I think the story could have been told in two, but I'll continue to trust in him. It may be unfair to compare this film with the Lord of the Rings films, but the fact is we wouldn't have this movie if it weren't for the trilogy. Had The Hobbit been made before the Rings series, perhaps it would have blown me away more.",4,"Welcome Return to Middle-Earth, Though Not Quite As Majestic",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2252,"['return', 'Middle-Earth', 'eight', 'years', 'concluding', 'installment', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'once', 'again', 'adapts', 'beloved', 'Tolkien', 'novel', 'silver', 'screen', 'prequel', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'accompany', 'band', 'dwarves', 'unwilling', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'journey', 'reclaim', 'homeland.On', 'own', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'majestic', 'fantastical', 'tale', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'please', 'audiences', 'ages', 'action', 'thrilling', 'story', 'full', 'humor', 'light-heartedness', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'would', 'expect', 'Jackson', 'film', 'sweeping', 'landscapes', 'elaborate', 'set', 'pieces', 'incredible', 'sense', 'grandeur', 'film', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'welcome', 'return', 'Middle-Earth', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'terrific', 'little', 'hero', ""'m"", 'incredibly', 'glad', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'returning', 'cast', 'member', 'role', 'masterfully', 'particularly', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Gandalf', 'new', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'quite', 'nicely.However', 'compared', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'saga', 'Hobbit', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'meet', 'expectations', 'had', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'already', 'impossibly', 'high', 'love', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'sense', 'shock', 'awe', 'was', 'hoping', 'film', 'pace', 'bit', 'especially', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'too', 'much', 'lot', 'backstory', 'cover', 'lot', 'characters', 'introduce', 'Also', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'CGI', 'intensive', 'almost', 'point', 'took', 'movie', 'understand', 'was', 'lot', 'CGI', 'Rings', 'films', 'just', 'felt', 'little', 'top.It', 'was', 'great', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'particularly', 'Gandalf', 'especially', 'Gollum', 'who', 'game', 'riddles', 'scene', 'Bilbo', 'easily', 'best', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sold', 'Jackson', 'persistence', 'making', 'three', 'films', 'think', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'two', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'trust', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'compare', 'film', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'trilogy', 'Had', 'Hobbit', 'been', 'made', 'Rings', 'series', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'blown', 'away', 'more']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448682,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0059XTU1S,DarthRad,"[2, 10]","I love the Lord of the Rings books and movies, and so first and foremost, as a huge fan, this movie is a wonderful return visit to the fantasy world of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  But the process of watching the movie proved to be a chore as it became apparent that Sir PJ (Peter Jackson) had burdened this movie with some terrible film making decisions.First the good parts - Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, the key new actors playing the young Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield, are outstanding!!  Andy Serkis does another fabulous turn as the twisted and tortured Gollum - his scenes with Martin Freeman playing the riddle game are worth the price of admission/DVD/BluRay alone!!  Ian McClellan is wonderful as always as Gandalf, and Cate Blanchett has never been so lustrous and beautiful as the elf queen Galadriel.  Ian Holm as the older Bilbo, Elijah Woods as Frodo, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond all make reassuring reappearances.  (Christopher Lee's reappearance as Saruman is a bit redundant).  Manu Bennett (Crixus the gladiator in the Spartacus series) does a fine job as Azog the pale Orc.The many, many battle scenes in this movie are awesome.The back stories of the dwarves, how they lost their kingdom under the mountains and how their enmity with the elves began, is told in rich detail, one of the key benefits to  ""The Hobbit"" getting stretched out into three parts.So what were the bad parts about the movie? And how could anybody accuse Sir PJ of bad film making?The bad part of stretching a small book like The Hobbitt out like this clearly are the slow and overly long padded parts such as the introduction of the dwarves  and Radagast the Brown's long segment.However, the biggest complaint of many movie critics has been how cheesy and unnatural this movie looks.  Nobody so far has clearly explained why, so here is my analysis.I watched this movie in 3D IMAX in 48fps.  Very simply, 48fps is a fine technology - it makes everything much clearer, and cleaner and does not make you vomit.  People who do not understand film making technology have unfairly blamed the many technical ills of this movie on 48fps.  It is NOT the culprit.The real culprit, what did make my stomach churn (and I do not get sick easily from watching movies with jittery camerawork) was Sir PJ's excessive use of camera motion in the vast majority of scenes in this movie.  Even simple close up shots of individuals engaged in conversation were framed by unnecessary dipping and panning camera movements!!!This was not the jittery handheld camera motion of documentary style movies like the Blair Witch Project.  These were PLANNED camera moves, done for stylistic purpose, no more.  Terrible, awful film maker's choice.What made this worse was the fact that these excessive, often useless camera movements appeared to be SPEEDED UP, as if somebody had hit the ""fast forward"" button on the movie all of a sudden and it was playing at 2x or 4x normal speed during those camera moves.Indeed, I suspect that what may have happened was that as Sir PJ realized that this movie was going to end up at nearly 3 hours long and that he had ONLY SHOT some of his key scenes with this extra camera movement,  that he needed to speed things up a bit and so he probably did fast forward through those scenes with the camera moves.Another problem  I started to notice - the digital lighting effects.  In previous DVD/BluRays, Sir PJ and his minions had explained their extensive use of digital post processing to enhance and correct for the unevenness of their filming, especially lighting effects.  With ""The Hobbit"" captured entirely by ultra-high resolution digital cameras, the end movie appears to have been post-processed to the max.The excessiveness of the post-processing, this attempt to make every scene appear digitally picture postcard ""perfect"" becomes apparent when viewing the scenes as a whole.  The scenes end up looking completely unnatural in appearance, very similar in ""look"" to what you get with TV soap operas, which are typically shot indoors in studio sets with multiple soft light sources that eliminate shadows,  poorly lit dark areas, overly bright reflections, and imperfect colors.As a result, very strangely, the most plastic and fake looking scenes in this move were the Hobbiton outdoor scenes, which were all filmed outdoors, on real, naturally created sets, and yet looked like an indoor TV studio set BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SHADOWS ANYWHERE AND THE DIGITALLY PERFECT LIGHTING WAS PERFECTLY DIFFUSE.  I noticed this as I was watching the movie and started looking for shadows in those scenes.  When I couldn't find any, I looked at the sky to see if there were a heavy dark total overcast of clouds blotting out the sun, but no, the sky was blue and bright.  And look carefully at Gandalf in every outdoor scene - wearing his broad brimmed hat, his face should always be in the shadows, and yet invariably, his face is unnaturally and brightly lit by a magical and cartoonish lighting while the bottom of his hat sits in total darkness.Sir PJ's  technical choices for this movie were clearly made with a film maker's zeal to do more, not to make a cheesy looking made-for-TV movie.  But combined together, they have the opposite effect.The excessive amounts of digital post processing for lighting, combined together with the excessive cartoonish fast forwarded camera movements, are what most make the movie look CHEESY and poorly crafted, despite all the high tech 48fps and outstanding motion capture and other high level attention to detail and special effects.It is little wonder that some of the best parts of the movie are where the camera director and post processing digital editor were throttled,  leaving us with fairly still, or simple slowly panning/soaring movements, as well a natural lighting.  It is in these scenes that all the beautiful visuals of this movie get their chance to shine through and take hold in our brains and allow us to immerse ourselves back into the world of Middle Earth.",4,"Wondrous return to Tolkien's Middle Earth, marred by bad film making decisions",1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,6025,"['love', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'books', 'movies', 'so', 'first', 'foremost',

Tolkien.  This time the source material is a comparatively thin volume, but Jackson has delved deep into Tolkien's elaborate appendices in order to expand it.  Is this a cynical cash grab intended to capitalize on the success of Lord of the Rings or a respectful attempt to bring Tolkien's world to life in the most fully-formed version possible?  For the studio, it's no doubt the former but I think for Jackson and his co-creators it is the latter.  I am in full sympathy with those who find this film bloated and  unwieldy, but I loved almost every minute of it and look forward to the inevitable expanded edition on DVD.  It's great to see such familiar faces as Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Andy Serkis/Gollum, and (especially) Christopher Lee.  Martin Freeman makes the ideal Bilbo.

At first I was disappointed when I learned the Hobbit was to be turned into three movies but now I'm excited and pleased by the prospect of three movies. For one thing it will give three more opportunities to visit the movie version of Middle Earth.This particular set of discs has something for everybody; the 3D version is effective and I found myself dodging a burning pinecone as it flew at my head. The Blu-Ray 2D version and the DVD also have excellent audio and video and are each enjoyable in their own way.One feature that I particularly enjoyed was the Special Features disc; it is filled with fascinating shots of New Zealand and, most importantly for me, the progressive story of the making of the movie told in 10 production videos hosted by Peter Jackson. The videos carry the process of producing the movie from the pre-production phase, through the production and post-production phases to the world premier in New Zealand. If you've ever wondered what all of those people with strange titles do then you have a chance to not only see what they do but to meet some of them as well. I was filled with a new respect for the incredible effort required to produce a movie like the Hobbit and get it to the screen!It was fun and very entertaining to watch and I recommend it along with the movie itself.

1448714,A13OUB4K10Z7F1,B0059XTU1S,Dennis Evans,"[13, 33]","I write this review with some sorrow.  The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) movie trilogy ranks among my all-time favorite movies and I had been eagerly awaiting the premier of The Hobbit ever since I heard that Peter Jackson (the director of the LOTR trilogy) would be directing The Hobbit.  What a let down!  It seems as if Peter Jackson is trying to force LOTR fans to buy 3 tickets instead of 1 or 2, and did this through unnecessary inflation of what should not have been a lengthy epic movie.Before I begin bashing the movie, I have to admit that it is not trivial to turn The Hobbit book into a movie.  The book ""The Hobbit"" appeared 17 years before the LOTR trilogy, and ""The Hobbit"" is not consistent with the LOTR trilogy in either content or tone.  This makes it impossible to be faithful to ""The Hobbit"" while maintaining some consistency with the LOTR.  For example:* In the written Hobbit, the One Ring is just a magic ring that makes someone invisible.  There was no indication of anything sinister about it until ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""* In the written Hobbit, Elrond was an elf, and a friend of Gandalf.  He let Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves stay at his house shortly after they escaped from the trolls.  There was no indication that he was king of Rivendell and a ""really serious person"" until ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""* The tone of the written Hobbit is that of a fairy tale, whereas the LOTR is a serious set of books about a world in deadly peril.  Similarly, the Gandalf of ""The Hobbit"" is a silly, comical wizard, unlike the dignified, serious, and philosophical Gandalf of the LOTR.Based on ""An Unexpected Journey,"" it appears that Peter Jackson is trying to manipulate the facts of ""The Hobbit"" to make them consistent with the LOTR trilogy, while moving the tone of ""The Hobbit"" about halfway from that of the book and that of the LOTR trilogy.  This is not an easy feat.Attempts to quantify the bloat.  I own the extra-long DVD version of the LOTR trilogy and I just love it.  It is 11.3 hours long, and it omitted a major sub-plot from the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring book (the journey through the haunted forest on the way to Bree, and the encounter with Tom Bombadil) and a major sub-plot from the second half of The Return of the King book (Saruman in the Shire).  Including the second omission would have required changes to the beginning of The Return of the King movie, to let Saruman live.  Had these two sub-plots been included in the extra-long DVD movie trilogy, the resulting length would probably have been about 12.5 hours.Now, let us start with the written source material.  The Hobbit book is between 25% and 30% as long as the LOTR book trilogy.  Multiplying 0.3 x 12.5 hours gives us 3.75 hours as the length for a Hobbit movie that covers all of the source material with the same thoroughness as the notional double extra-long LOTR DVD.  The Hobbit book does leave some gaps that could reasonably be filled in.  For example, Gandalf leaves Bilbo and the dwarves slightly over a third of the way through the book, with virtually no explanation.  He returns at the very end of the book, and indicates that he had an adventure of his own, which he describes in less than a page.  It might be reasonable to explain Gandalf's departure and cover his adventure, instead of focusing purely on Bilbo.  Doing these things could increase the maximum length of a non-bloated movie to about five hours - two movies of 2.5 hours each.  Unfortunately, the first of three Hobbit movies is almost three hours long, thus implying a total length of nearly 9 hours.Another reasonable comparison would be with the Harry Potter books and movies.  Each of the seven Harry Potter books is longer than The Hobbit, but each of the first six books equated to one movie of less than 3 hours in length.  The final Harry Potter book translated into two movies with a combined length of about 4.5 hours.Description of the bloat.  The movie contains lots of bloated scenes plus unnecessary scenes.  I could go on at great length, but discussing the first hour captures most of the problems.  The movie begins with a brief scene of an elderly Bilbo describing his great adventure to an unseen Frodo.  This is OK and provides continuity with the LOTR movie trilogy.  The movie then shifts to a roughly ten-minute depiction of a dragon taking over the mountain home of the dwarves.  This scene is completely unnecessary and corresponds to a fraction of a page in the book, when the dwarves told Bilbo that a dragon had evicted them from their home.  The movie then shifts back to a scene with Bilbo and Frodo talking the day before Bilbo's birthday party at the beginning of the LOTR.  This scene could have been combined with the opening scene, and shortened.  The movie then shows the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarves at Bilbo's home.  The movie turns a few pages in the book into a plodding 30+ minutes of meaningless blather.  This whole scene could have been done well in 15 minutes.  This pattern repeats itself throughout the movie.  In particular, every action sequence in the book gets drawn out interminably in the movie, with the number of implausible escapes multiplied by a factor of five or more.  Moreover, the movie adds two unnecessary and extraneous sub-plots not present in the book:  the entire interlude with the wizard Radagast, and the battle with the orcs just before Bilbo et al reach Rivendell.  Ugh!It may still be possible to rescue the second and third movies.  Jackson needs to do whatever it takes to get movies two and three down to less than two hours each.  Most of this can probably be done by tighter editing of things already filmed.  In some cases, however, it may be impossible to get a bloated ten-minute scene down to a crisp five-minute scene by better editing of material already filmed.  In these cases, it would be necessary to re-shoot some scenes, assuming that the relevant actors are still available.",2,Bloated Beyond Belief,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,5980,"['write', 'review',

All the seriousness of the Lord of the Rings seems to have left some of the actors who were in the LOTR movies and this one. Lord Elrond as well.. (Gandalf: ""I'm not quite dressed for dinner."", Elrond: ""You never are?"") I didn't find the attempts at humor to be very humorous. I thought Cate Blanchett was excellent as always. The pacing of the film was a bit slow and disjointed. Too much digital work. The king of the Goblins and Azog were disappointingly full CGI. I feel we lose quite a bit in this translation. I like a fantasy film to be a bit darker more ominous.. to have a sense of doubt and wonder at the world. To see the magic and landscapes that make your mind soar. I didn't feel this movie had that. The rock giants fighting to me was quite boring and looked more like a ride at Islands of adventure theme parks. I thought Bilbo was ""OK"". I thought Richard Armitage's performance of Thorin was one of the bright spots. I enjoyed the dwarves quite a bit in this film. I also enjoyed seeing Hobbiton again and frodo.

1448740,A1EQ35NR4CZL6Y,B0059XTU1S,Dmarkwind,"[6, 8]","Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, this edition adds back in footage which was deleted primarily to make the theatrical film shorter. But whereas each of the LOTR extended versions were 40 minutes to an hour longer than their theatrical counterparts, the extended edition lengthens The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey by only about 15 minutes. I&#8217;ll speculate this is because the relatively late decision to make the Hobbit into three rather than two movies meant there was less &#8220;leftover&#8221; material.I don&#8217;t like that there apparently isn&#8217;t a version which has both the Blue Ray and DVD extended editions together and so you have to choose one or the other. I also don&#8217;t like that unlike the LOTR extended editions, this set doesn&#8217;t include a chart telling you which scenes were added or extended.The only documentary included in this set is called &#8220;New Zealand: The Home of Middle Earth.&#8221; It&#8217;s basically a six-and-a-half minute travel promotion which shows how various places on the island nation were turned into parts of Tolkien&#8217;s Middle Earth. It includes an animated map and has various members of  the cast talking about the appeal of the country&#8217;s spectacular scenery. It&#8217;s actually entertaining, but it&#8217;s short.The best I can tell, the few totally new scenes added in this extended edition are mostly located at the start of each of the two disks the movie has been divided into for this set, although they&#8217;ve all been added to this presentation of the film in sequence of the story  rather than as a separate menu of &#8220;added scenes.&#8221; This means you have to watch the whole film to see the new stuff, but it also means you see it in context.Towards the beginning of the disk one, there&#8217;s a brief new scene where a very young Bilbo meets Gandalf. After the scene where adult Bilbo encounters Gandalf outside his front door, there&#8217;s a short new scene where Bilbo goes into Hobbiton to buy the fish which Dwalin the dwarf eventually eats at Bilbo&#8217;s table. At the beginning of disk two, there&#8217;s four short new scenes all set in the elves&#8217; city of  Rivendell. In the first, Bilbo is enjoying a view of the waterfalls from a veranda and Lord Elrond comes along and has this little conversation with him. The two share a moment of humor and depart, but it&#8217;s nice because the theatrical version didn&#8217;t have these two interacting on a one-on-one basis at all. Then there&#8217;s a wordless scene where Bilbo wanders into the hall where the shards of Isuldur&#8217;s famous sword are kept and he sees a painting depicting Sauron wielding the one ring. Then Elrond and his assistant come upon the dwarves frolicking in a Rivendell fountain. There&#8217;s also a new scene where Bilbo and Thorin overhear Elrond talking to Gandalf about the history of mental illness in Thorin&#8217;s family.The rest of the new material consists of extended versions of scenes already in the theatrical version. In the early scene which sets up the backstory the dwarve&#8217;s city of Erebor and the surrounding human town of Dale, the extended edition shows a little more how the dwarves and Wood Elf King Thranduil came to be at odds, and slightly  more of the destruction of Dale by the dragon Smaug (although it really doesn&#8217;t show any more of that character). In the scene where Gandalf meets with Suramon, Elrond, and Galadrial, there&#8217;s an extra bit of conversation where they reference the rings of power and the one ring and Suramon expresses his belief that it was washed into the sea and will remain lost forever. Also in Rivendell, but towards the end of disk one, the scene where the dwarves are eating dinner hosted by the elves is extended with new footage where Bofur interrupts the elves&#8217; harp and flute music to jump onto the table and sing a bawdy pub song and the scene ends with a food fight, much to the elves&#8217; dismay. When the dwarves are captured and taken to Goblintown, this sequence is extended by an additional song by the Great Goblin and a little more conversation with the dwarves. There may be a few extra seconds added elsewhere, but these are the ones I noticed.A long debate could probably be had over how much the new material really enhances the film.  After all, it really doesn&#8217;t change anything or add significantly to the plot. But for me, Peter Jackson&#8217;s version of Middle Earth is a place I love to visit and any chance to linger a little longer is welcome, especially when the added footage melds relatively seamlessly with what was in the theatrical version.

Dwarf names like Ori, Nori, Dori, Kili, Fili, only lend themselves to the light-hearted nature of this tale, originally written and published for children around 9 to 12 years of age.  It was a far cry from Tolkien's much more ominous, dark, brooding 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .which is why I'll never understand why terrific director/producer/writer Peter Jackson would even try to make such a silly story into a massive, three-part epic.  In order to do this, Jackson had to go back and mine the Appendices, and backstory, of 'Lord of the Rings'; the villain of this first installment of THE HOBBIT, Azog, is a product of the Appendices.  So what we have here, although it's a beautifully crafted, well-made, visually impressive film, is a 3-hour cartoon, sans the utter darkness of Jackson's previous presentation ofThe Lord of the Rings.  It is a wonderful film to watch, augmented by Howard Shore's haunting musical score, but it's an uneven, often thinly-veiled depiction of what should be a two-hour light snack.I've got no problems with the cast, either; Ian McKellen returns as the wizard Gandalf, and Martin Freeman turns in an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, 60 years previous than the Ian Holm depiction in 'Lord of the Rings'.  Other solid performances include a stern-looking Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, and I especially liked the performances of Graham McTavish (Dwalin), James Nesbitt (Bofur), and Aidan Turner (Kili).  From the original 'Lord of the Rings' production, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis, all return for brief appearances.  Yet the whimsical, child-like nature of this film springs forth in spades, from the gaudy haircuts/outfits of the dwarves, to the animated hordes of Orcs; again, all of this lends itself to the notion that THE HOBBIT in its entirety should have been a lighthearted, two-hour film.  It was grand to revisit gorgeous New Zealand, a character in itself as Middle Earth, and was grand to meet once again all the characters we have come to love from 'Lord of the Rings'.  But Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT:  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, the first installment of a massive three-part epic, is a mile wide, an inch deep, and a visual cartoon that meanders a tad too long.--D.

Trouble with that is it gets very boring after the least bit of time.This is supposed to be the prequel to LOTR.  We are supposed to be told how Bilbo Baggins, he of the Hobbit clan (with the huge hairy feet), got involved in all this, etc., etc., etc.  We are introduced to Gandalf the Dirty, er, Grey, mumbled by Sir Ian McKellen, and other principles, i.e. the dwarfs, who all had rhyming names:  Oogle and Floogle, Plink and Plunk, Oobie and Scoobie, Nick and Nack, and they're led by Rob Zombie, who always looks like he's just been hit in the head with a brick.  And I swear this film needed to come with an option for subtitles because just about EVERYTHING that is said is either mumbled or said so softly you cannot hear it.  Ian McKellen is the worst, but they all reminded me of the characters of Edward and Bella in that other now-fabled franchise, who would make you believe the outcome of the world hinges on their every word.  And for the people on here who have stated ""they did the book justice,"" I'm just wondering WHAT book they did justice to.Director Peter Jackson managed to make an overblown, engorged version of a classic novel--and he managed to just about completely ruining it.

1448764,A2U4US8N80LY8W,B0059XTU1S,D. Reed,"[22, 31]","Some background on me: it's been nearly 40 years since the first time I read The Hobbit. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are my two favorite novels of all time. I own paperback versions that are so old the covers are torn. I own newer versions and I bought the kindle versions. Okay, I'm a little crazy about these books.I went to see An Unexpected Journey with mild trepidation. I had read some of the professional reviews. My brother saw it before I did and said ""It dragged."" But it was Peter Jackson, the man who brought LOTR to life so well. And I'd bought the tickets for my 17-year daughter and I to see the IMAX 3D version. So we went. And we loved it.Can I ask a silly question? What's wrong with a story taking its time to tell it's tale? One can hardly claim that ""An Unexpected Journey"" doesn't have action, it certainly does and plenty of it. Orcs and goblins fighting with dwarves, not to mention trolls and giants. But the story isn't afraid to breathe, to draw things out a little, to let us gaze in wonder while we contemplate the wonders that Peter Jackson & crew have bestowed upon us. My favorite moment: gliding on the wings of eagles through the Misty Mountains. I'd pictured that moment when I first read the book, almost 4 decades ago. And Jackson captured it perfectly. Have we been so inundated with movies like ""Transformers"" with so much action and so little plot that we all have ADHD when it comes to watching a movie? (and for the record, I didn't care for the Transformers).It's a fair point that ""An Unexpected Journey"" is not completely faithful to the source material. There's a lot of added material and most of it Jackson made up on his own. But he did that with LOTR and I don't see people whining about it (now). And for the most part, the changes made work. If pressed I'd have to say that I wish the troll scene was more like the book.Maybe it's not your cup of tea (or pipe-weed to smoke). But for this Hobbit fan, I was enthralled. I can't wait for The Desolation of Smaug! And my daughter absolutely adores Richard Armitage. My only conundrum: buy the theatrical version now or wait for the extended edition? That's a tough one. No, WB, I'm not buying both. I'm leaning towards the theatrical version because although the deleted scenes might be interesting, this isn't the LOTR where I'm hoping to see scenes cut from the movie that were in the book like Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship.Update - conundrum solved! Thank you DirecTV and Pay Per View! I recorded ""An Unexpected Journey"" off pay per view and burned to a DVD. And at $4.99 I can justify getting the 'extended edition' in the fall. Hooray! Now I'm off to blunt the knives and break the plates! :^)",5,Part I - everything I wanted and more,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2713,"['background', 'been', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'Hobbit', 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'novels', 'time', 'own', 'paperback', 'versions', 'are', 'so', 'old', 'covers', 'are', 'torn', 'own', 'newer', 'versions', 'bought', 'kindle', 'versions', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'little', 'crazy', 'books.I', 'went', 'see', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'mild', 'trepidation', 'had', 'read', 'professional', 'reviews', 'brother', 'saw', 'did', 'said', 'dragged', 'was', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'LOTR', 'life', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'bought', 'tickets', '17-year', 'daughter', 'see', 'IMAX', '3D', 'version', 'went', 'loved', 'it.Can', 'ask', 'silly', 'question', 'What', 'wrong', 'story', 'taking', 'time', 'tell', 'tale', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'claim', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', ""n't"", 'have', 'action', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'Orcs', 'goblins', 'fighting', 'dwarves', 'not', 'mention', 'trolls', 'giants', 'story', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'breathe', 'draw', 'things', 'out', 'little', 'let', 'gaze', 'wonder', 'contemplate', 'wonders', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'crew', 'have', 'bestowed', 'favorite', 'moment', 'gliding', 'wings', 'eagles', 'Misty', 'Mountains', ""'d"", 'pictured', 'moment', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'almost', '4', 'decades', 'ago', 'Jackson', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'Have', 'been', 'so', 'inundated', 'movies', 'Transformers', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'so', 'little', 'plot', 'have', 'ADHD', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'record', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Transformers', '.It', 'fair', 'point', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'not', 'completely', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'lot', 'added', 'material', 'most', 'Jackson', 'made', 'up', 'own', 'did', 'LOTR', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'people', 'whining', 'now', 'most', 'part', 'changes', 'made', 'work', 'pressed', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'wish', 'troll', 'scene', 'was', 'more', 'book.Maybe', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'pipe-weed', 'smoke', 'Hobbit', 'fan', 'was', 'enthralled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Desolation', 'Smaug', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'only', 'conundrum', 'buy', 'theatrical', 'version', 'now', 'wait', 'extended', 'edition', 'tough', 'one', 'No', 'WB', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', ""'m"", 'leaning', 'theatrical', 'version', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'LOTR', 'where', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'see', 'scenes', 'cut', 'movie', 'were', 'book', 'Galadriel', 'gifts', 'Fellowship.Update', 'conundrum', 'solved', 'Thank', 'DirecTV', 'Pay', 'Per', 'View', 'recorded', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'pay', 'view', 'burned', 'DVD', '4.99', 'can', 'justify', 'getting', ""'extended"", 'edition', 'fall', 'Hooray', 'Now', ""'m"", 'blunt', 'knives', 'break', 'plates', '^']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448782,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B0059XTU1S,dv_forever,"[4, 8]","This is a review from a non-fan of the whole Lord of the Rings universe. I really enjoyed my time at the movies watching the Hobbit. It wasn't the story or the characters that really drew me into this fantasy epic, it was the technology behind the filming process. I'm sure most people reading this are in the know to some degree about the HFR ( high-frame rate ) 48 frames per second vs the standard cinematic 24 frames per second debate. I must say that the 48 fps really made the film for me.This is more of a technical review. I'm a filmmaker myself and have worked with the standard 24fps for the cinema look, 30fps for the video look, and a wide variety of frame rates ranging from 12-60fps for fast or slow motion effects. But this movie is quite apart from that. To see a huge budget film like the Hobbit on the big screen in 3D projected at 48fps, the way it was filmed, wow! A stunning experiences at the movies, one of a kind. Perhaps the most spectacular visuals on screen since Avatar three years ago.Since this is a new process for a mainstream Hollywood narrative film, lots of people are going to compare it to things they already know. Such as videogames, high definition sports broadcasts, documentaries, soap operas, auto motion plus on your HDTV, what have you -- the Hobbit doesn't look like any of those experiences, it's something unique. What does doubling the frame rate do? Twice as much clarity in the picture, much more immersion in the environment, a lifelike quality to everything. Perhaps I can say that it felt almost like live theater in an alternate reality at times but with all the camera angles, shots, movement and effects that theater cannot provide.Think of it this way... standard cinematic 24fps is beautiful, it's dreamy, like a window into another world, 24fps has the quality of a memory. 48fps instead has the quality of a ""you are there feeling"", as if you are in the environment with the characters interacting with the world. The 3D adds immensely to feeling immersed in this new environment. In fact this is the clearest, most natural 3D I've seen, the best since Avatar. Lots of richness, great depth of field and it's precisely because of the 48fps. Let's also mention the C.G.I. ( computer generated imagery ) -- the high frame rate is a blessing for C.G.I. How many recent movies have we seen where the computer effects look fake and annoying even though the films cost hundreds of millions of dollars? The most advanced effects are hampered by 24fps, here in the Hobbit at 48fps, the computer effects blend so well with the real actors and locations that you truly can stop worrying about them and accept the effects as if they were real life.True... the physics of the C.G.I. can get a bit clunky at times. Those giant wolf dog monsters that are running around all the time, the physics aren't perfect. But I didn't expect the perfect physics displayed in Avatar -- The Hobbit still compensates with the pale Orc leader and the King of the Orcs in his mountain hideout. Those visuals are just ridiculous! Amazingly lifelike and convincing. And what about the scene with the three trolls who capture the dwarfs and Bilbo Baggins? Astounding special effects when viewed in 3D at 48fps.Okay, enough about the HFR 3D -- the movie was filmed this way, it deserves to be seen this way, this is the intention of the director. This process of filming is not some cheesy gimmick, it's the real thing... a new magical experience at the cinema.Some words about the film beyond the technical stuff. Um, well... the movie takes a while to get going, to find it's pace. The scene with the dwarfs with Bilbo and Gandalf in Bilbo's house goes on too long. Finally, once the adventure begins, the pacing picks ups and the movie blossoms. Peter Jackson's direction of actors is always high class. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is the standout performance. Andy Serkis returns as Gollum and for once I actually liked his antics ( thank you 48fps 3D! ). The action sequences are top-notch. The troll scene... the mountain dudes fighting in the rain at night... the big battle with the orcs near the end... all fantastic.The tone of the film is more comical, lighter of heart than the gray, doom and gloom that plagued much of the ""Lord of the Rings trilogy"". This quality was a plus to me, I could never fully connect with Lord of the Rings for whatever reason. Maybe it was Frodo that irked me, I like the young Bilbo Baggins much more. Since the tone is lighter, the stakes are not death and end of world matters. It's about a group of oddballs who are journeying to defeat a dragon and the crazy adventures they get into along the way. It's almost a party movie. There is a lot of humor. Not to say the film has no gravitas, this is Peter Jackson's vision and he can turn the tone and go intense and savage when it needs to be. The dark elements are usually centered around that evil pale Orc.The ending of the film is a ""to be continued"" scenario, no resolution -- as to be expected. There are two more Hobbit films coming up. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies with this one and I'll be back for more! Bring it, Peter Jackson, bring that HFR 3D!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[15, 22]","Ever since ""The Lord of the Rings"" ended, fans have been clamoring for ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted as well.Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first part of a trilogy of ""Hobbit"" movies. It has some few flaws (enough with the comedy!), but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.It took me two viewings of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd. The second time, I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of ""The Hobbit"" (plus chunks of ""Unfinished Tales"") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast.As for the extended special edition, this only has twelve minutes of new footage -- and since it was a long movie from a duology-turned-trilogy, that isn't surprising. But it will have the vast wealth of extras that we've come to expect from Peter Jackson: ""The Appendices,"" a massive documentary that explores the entire filming of the movie. NINE HOURS OF EXTRAS, including audio commentary from Jackson and Phillipa Boyens.The comedy can be a bit grating, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.",4,The world isn't in your books.

""The Hobbit,"" however, is a single volume, and more a children's story.  Like many children's stories, it has action and scares, but it always struck me as more lighthearted and less allegorical than ""Lord of the Rings.""I suppose it is a matter of taste.  I can accept eliminating some scenes in a book when adapting it for film, but I have difficulty accepting inserting scenes and characters that the author never intended  to exist to expand a movie.  It seems not only extremely presumptuous, but also may let the director's ego and narcissism run rampant. I think that is what happened here. The cast are excellent.  Ian McKellen returns in a masterful performance of Gandalf, and Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins is convincing and enjoyable.  Richard Armitage's Thorin doesn't seem to be as empathetic a character as John Rhys-Davies's Gimli, but it's still a professional performance.The visuals are spectacular, but the story drags, and is presented as ominous prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"", something I don't think Tolkien had in mind when he first penned ""The Hobbit"".

1448800,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0059XTU1S,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","This review absolutely must be prefaced with a complaint. This is really this 1st time I have ever complained about the other reviews on Amazon. All I read was ""bad streaming"" or ""the ultraviolet is crap"" or words to that effect. No real review, no real anything.And they are the ones who had the nerve to come on here and rate this film with either 1, 2 or 3 stars. Let's have some genuine reviews, people. There were some reviewers who didn't seem to realize Peter Jackson directed this, and there you have the quality of the reviews for this film. At least the blind 5-star-givers wrote detailed reviews, albeit excessively glowing ones.THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, PART I (Dir. Peter Jackson, 2012, 180 minutes) was something of a vertiginous, video-game experience I'm not sure I liked that well. My wife, being a pure Tolkien-head, loved it without question.This first of what I understand will be three films covers Tolkien'sThe Hobbitfrom the beginning (featuring a somewhat annoying appearance by Ian Holm and Elijah Wood) to about the time the group has finished smacking around some trolls. Or goblins ... hell, I don't know, it's been decades since I read the book and more than a few years since I saw the cartoon.The stars don't particularly shine here and that's a shame (Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is very good, but I think he's straining in an attempt to be a young Ian Holm; Ian McKellen is simply getting old as the hills and frankly drags as Gandalf). One great standout is Sylvester McCoy (Dr. Who Number 7 for the unwashed masses) as Radaghast the Brown. Now THAT I always thought would be a challenging role for anyone. McCoy actually puts all the others to shame, even if he did a comically twitchy and weird interpretation.Fact is since Tolkien avoided writing anything about Radaghast, McCoy's creation is as good a guess as anyone's. Obviously Radaghast was not a wizard on a par with Gandalf and was 'beneath' Gandalf in rank. This contrasted a lot with the rather sagging performances from almost everyone else; I expected the impact of the RINGS trilogy and did not get a bit of it.The dwarves really did not interest me, as indeed they never have, but I liked seeing the two cute young dwarves. As my wife answered my query about handsome dwarves, ""Maybe they get progressively uglier as they get older."" Excellent point. Did Tolkien come up with that originally, anyone know?This, I noted from some very early complaints in the big media reviews, is shot in 3D. Well, it looks it even if it isn't in 3D. It looked fine otherwise, so I really do not know why so many complain about the cinematography or remark that it ""looks cheap"". Looks almost like Jackson'sThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions)  [Blu-ray] - which had its share of cheap sets too.All in all this was a familiar therefore perennial favorite story, but it wasn't given the treatment it merits. Or the respect, for that matter. Swallowed lines and overbearing music made for a sonic smear that matched the film. Since Jackson is dragging this out too, I hope the next two films get progressively better, as my wife says dwarves get progressively uglier.",4,A 4th star for the 7th Doctor,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,3263,"['review', 'absolutely', 'must', 'be', 'prefaced', 'complaint', 'really', '1st', 'time', 'have', 'ever', 'complained', 'other', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'read', 'was', 'bad', 'streaming', 'ultraviolet', 'crap', 'words', 'effect', 'real', 'review', 'real', 'anything.And', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'nerve', 'come', 'here', 'rate', 'film', '1', '2', '3', 'stars', 'Let', 'have', 'genuine', 'reviews', 'people', 'were', 'reviewers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'directed', 'there', 'have', 'quality', 'reviews', 'film', 'least', 'blind', '5-star-givers', 'wrote', 'detailed', 'reviews', 'excessively', 'glowing', 'ones.THE', 'HOBBIT', 'AN', 'UNEXPECTED', 'JOURNEY', 'PART', 'Dir', 'Peter', 'Jackson', '2012', '180', 'minutes', 'was', 'something', 'vertiginous', 'video-game', 'experience', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'well', 'My', 'wife', 'being', 'pure', 'Tolkien-head', 'loved', 'question.This', 'first', 'what', 'understand', 'will', 'be', 'three', 'films', ""Tolkien'sThe"", 'Hobbitfrom', 'beginning', 'featuring', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'appearance', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'time', 'group', 'finished', 'smacking', 'trolls', 'goblins', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'decades', 'read', 'book', 'more', 'few', 'years', 'saw', 'cartoon.The', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'shine', 'here', 'shame', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'straining', 'attempt', 'be', 'young', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'simply', 'getting', 'old', 'hills', 'frankly', 'drags', 'Gandalf', 'One', 'great', 'standout', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Number', '7', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'Radaghast', 'Brown', 'Now', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'challenging', 'role', 'anyone', 'McCoy', 'actually', 'others', 'shame', 'even', 'did', 'comically', 'twitchy', 'weird', 'interpretation.Fact', 'Tolkien', 'avoided', 'writing', 'anything', 'Radaghast', 'McCoy', 'creation', 'as', 'good', 'guess', 'anyone', 'Obviously', 'Radaghast', 'was', 'not', 'wizard', 'par', 'Gandalf', 'was', ""'beneath"", 'Gandalf', 'rank', 'contrasted', 'lot', 'rather', 'sagging', 'performances', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'expected', 'impact', 'RINGS', 'trilogy', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'bit', 'it.The', 'dwarves', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'interest', 'indeed', 'never', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing', 'two', 'cute', 'young', 'dwarves', 'wife', 'answered', 'query', 'handsome', 'dwarves', 'Maybe', 'get', 'progressively', 'uglier', 'get', 'older', 'Excellent', 'point', 'Did', 'Tolkien', 'come', 'up', 'originally', 'anyone', 'know', 'noted', 'very', 'early', 'complaints', 'big', 'media', 'reviews', 'shot', '3D', 'Well', 'even', ""n't"", '3D', 'looked', 'fine', 'otherwise', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'complain', 'cinematography', 'remark', 'cheap', 'almost', ""Jackson'sThe"", 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Trilogy', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Two', 'Towers', '/', 'Return', 'King', 'Extended', 'Editions', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'had', 'share', 'cheap', 'sets', 'too.All', 'was', 'familiar', 'therefore', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'treatment', 'respect', 'matter', 'Swallowed', 'lines', 'overbearing', 'music', 'made', 'sonic', 'smear', 'matched', 'film', 'Jackson', 'dragging', 'out', 'too', 'hope', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'get', 'progressively', 'better', 'wife', 'get', 'progressively', 'uglier']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

No fantasy or epic film can match The Lord of the Rings trilogy, being perfect for a film and its deliverance (even if there are differences between it and the books). Middle Earth was created for us, it felt real, and still does when seeing the films. Now, there are other tales in the world of Lord of the Rings, and they've finally brought to the big screen The Hobbit, the prequel to The Lord of the Rings. Now, if anyone other than Peter Jackson was attached to The Hobbit, it would have failed on every level, as Peter Jackson is the only one who can truly take us into that fantastical world, along with the original crew of producers, writers and the composer (Howard Shore). Now, when it comes to The Hobbit, things are different from The Lord of the Rings. Now some people say that The Hobbit was a little too slow in the beginning, but if you compare the beginning to Fellowship of the Ring, they are the exact same pacing. The script is gold, being filled with funny quips, intense fright, and epic battle sequences. The acting was top-notch, especially when it came to Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the Company of Dwarves. Peter Jackson took the character (to those who've read the book, know he was more of a jerk) and made him a likeable warrior who is haunted by his past, by not being able to save Erebor, or so it seems. Peter Jackson is perfect once again, going back to the world that was pictured for us, and brings it back to life. The visual effects were great, but not as spectacular and ""real"" as Prometheus. The music was superb, being the classic Lord of the Rings, while adding a new theme from the ""Misty Mountains"". Now i do agree that making The Hobbit into a trilogy may stretch it thin, but from how An Unexpected Journey turned out, i'm starting to root for more because this place that Peter Jackson has brought to us can only be seen through J.R.R. Tolkien's writing, our imagination, or through the exceptional adaptation that Jackson has done.

This past decade they have passed away - all but one - at grand old age -  and so the stories warm me more than ever.The books are long because Tolkien sets up his scenarios at length, and shares  not just the fun dishwashing magic song in the early scenes of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; , but a song and poem made and shared for every event, and references to their ancient forebears in every major moment.SOME setup is necessary if we are to be in full sympathy with the story, and its characters, so I would have liked to have seen a bit more at outset about the wonders of the Dwarf kingdom.  Although they DID share some footage of the emerald and gold walls and columns and monuments in Erebor within the Lonely Mountain.  I would have liked to have seen a grand tour of the place  ( an extended edition that does just that, maybe?)  as a FOCUS not a &#34;while-you're up&#34;, since, that way we are able to be properly empathetic with the terrible loss of their kingdom and home, when it comes, and to long for restoration with the Dwarves.It was nice to finally see a lady dwarf, as Gimli said in &#34;LOTR: The Two Towers&#34;  that the women can be so shy that it is often thought there ARE no dwarf women. They are lovely, and probably skilled.It is my only grievance with Tolkien - he and his wife were a famous romance and very happy, but when Tolkien was a boy, with a delver Father, he himself and his brother were orphaned and raised by priests who sent him to Oxford in light of his prodigious mind in childhood. This was a fortunate thing for Tolkien and the world ( i.e., us )  But his culture was very male - no girls.To add to it: Then he was a good and happy Father - of four  boys, and I think his classes when he taught were all-male as well.This, of course, leads to the experience of the females in the book as either boyish or even mannish warriors,  or shy and &#34;uber-ladies&#34;, possessed of the love to the point of extreme sacrifice and the range of old-days classical skills. But none of the women in the story are &#34;today women&#34;, in spite of gentle efforts on the part of production to portray the women as important, at least, to the story, and full of virtue.  And the story is set in &#34;olden days&#34; when things were male-dominated, and so we are happy that it goes as nicely as it does on that point.I am always charmed by the personalities of the characters, major and minor - they all have a way of endearing us. A turn of the head, a tone of voice, a quirk in the ways - so faithfully done up by the Wingnuts here.

This review is for the Extended Edition 3-disc Blu-ray of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. (The DVD version is 5 discs. If in doubt, check the minutes shown in the details of the page.)I did a review of the extended edition Fellowship of the Rings. It was fantastic and well worth the money as were the extended editions of the other two movies.The extended edition for The Hobbit is not as fantastic. There are a couple scenes that really make you think, &#34;Ohhhh! Now I get it!&#34; but that's about it. In spite of the minimal changes, it is still worth the money in my opinion. The additional material is also good - not as good as the Lord of the Rings extended editions but still.I have never read the books and he read them but a long time ago so we can not speak to any differences between the books and the movie.If you are choosing between buying the extended edition and the original, definitely buy the extended edition.If you are not a big fan and you already own the original version, you might not want to bother.If you are a fan, even if you own the original version, you will probably appreciate the extended edition - it's a borderline call.The packaging is a little different than the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings but it was designed to be part of that set and that shows. I don't care about that really but I understand collectors do.Until now, we have not purchased Blu-rays but we happened to need another dvd player and the prices for the Blu-rays have dropped so much we decided to go ahead with the Blu-ray player. We had seen the Blu-ray movies in stores displayed next to the DVD version of the movies and the difference was amazing. Still, with neither of us being fanatical about picture quality and sound beyond the &#34;quite good&#34; point, it is still more expensive to buy the Blu-ray discs (although they are dropping in price). We came to the conclusion that it would be worth it to buy Blu-rays of movies that were particularly graphic intensive such as the Hobbit but for run of the mill movies we would stick with the cheaper dvds.We were disappointed with the Hobbit on Blu-ray. We had watched the Hobbit before on pay-per-view and we could not see any real difference between the HD and the Blu-ray. In this case, the Blu-ray was actually a dollar or so cheaper so no big deal but don't expect to be stunned by the Blu-ray.This came with a code for a free Ultraviolet copy. If you don't know what this is please do your research. Since we did not go out and buy brand new latest and greatest equipment just to watch this movie, the free Ultraviolet copy was useless. It would not play on anything except our new Blu-ray player and why would we need it for that? We have the Blu-ray disc.

1448818,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0059XTU1S,Enjolras,"[3, 6]","UPDATE (4/24/2013): This blu-ray disc does NOT contain a digital copy. It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.First, a disclaimer:I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).With that said, here are some of my thoughts:STORY/BOOK ADAPTATIONI'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.***END SPOILER ALERT***As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.CHARACTERS/ACTINGI generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the ""Took"" (adventurous) and ""Baggins"" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.SPECIAL EFFECTSGenerally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.OVERALLThe Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.",4,shy of greatness,1355443200,"12 14,

1448819,A4796VPATRFR1,B0059XTU1S,Eoghann Irving,"[11, 14]","I think it's important to judge movies (or books or anything else really) not based on what I want them to be, but what they are attempting to be. And that's particularly relevant here.Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit.  And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed.This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie.On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here.In fact the humor and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarves, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive.But what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarves. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy.Speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favorite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.By this point the Tolkien purists will be ready to strangle me I'm sure. But this was not a movie for the purist.Tolkien in fact would have hated it. But then I suspect he hated most movies. He disliked technology, he didn't like noise and generally speaking he was a grumpy stick in the mud. And the movie wasn't made for him either.The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasizing the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.There are some liberties taken with characterization. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarves in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.The party are still heavily dependent on Gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day. But you do get the feeling that if he hadn't they would have gone down fighting rather than totally ineffectually.What you're getting here isn't a children's movie. It's a modern action movie. Complete with scenes that might have appeared in a video game. Jackson's signature swooping camera is very much in evidence and the scale of the sets is huge.In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarves Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected.James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kilie and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.The Riddles in the Dark sequence is another of my favorite bits in the movie. A tense sequence that blends comedy and tension right down to the ending.Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo on screen, not Martin Freeman.Which brings me on to time. This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.So where does that leave us?I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it.  Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.",5,A Prequel To The Movies More Than An Adaptation Of The Book,1365897600,"04 14,

I enjoyed it, but there isn't much here that you haven't already seen in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, so you pretty much have to take it as an extension of those earlier films.Here's the scoop. This is the story of Bilbo Baggins as he goes on his first adventure. It's the adventure whereby he tries to help the Dwarves regain their home. A home from which they were displaced many years prior due to the assault of a horrid, fire breathing dragon. It is also the adventure where Bilbo first meets Gollum and comes into the possession of the all important ring from the subsequent trilogy.This has a lot of great stuff in it and is full of whimsy. You have a forest wizard who allows a bird to nest on his head and gets pulled along by a sled driven by a bunch of rabbits. Mountains that fight it out with one another and a band of Dwarves with more personality than one can readily digest. But there is also much familiar from the earlier three movies. Some of the landscapes and vast underground caverns will be all too familiar to viewers. The sweeping, overhead camera is, by now, a trademark of Jackson's directing. The CGI and a few other effects are essentially identical to the original three movies. Some of the costumes and set ideas were tweeked a bit but the overall look is familiar. The actors all do a stand-up job and Martin Freeman was a wise choice for a young Bilbo.I did like this movie but I think it needed something to separate it from the originals. Some could argue, soundly, that, being cut from the same cloth, this movie needed to look like the others. IMHO, the other movies total nearly 12 hours and we've had an eyeful of these things.

Now some people will complain this film is too long, some will say there is no reason for this one book to be split up into an entire trilogy of films, but I'll just say that I appreciate everything Peter Jackson is doing.  When you have 13 dwarves, and countless other characters and enemies to introduce and explore, and multiple plot points and stories to tell, it's pretty difficult to cover it all in one 3 hour film, which is why I think Jackson decided to expand it into three films (well that and I'm sure money had something to do with it too).  I enjoyed how the movie took its time in the beginning and didn't rush right into any battles or chase sequences...there's nothing wrong with making the audience wait a little bit before all the action starts and instead introducing them to some characters and back story, which I think Jackson did a pretty good job at here.While I do recommend to most people that waiting for the Extended Edition of this film to hit Blu-Ray in November (or sometime in the Fall) is the smart thing to do, I just loved this film so much that I couldn't wait that long to watch this again in hi-def, so I figured why not just buy this version (the 5-disc 3D version that is) now, and then later on in the year when the EE comes out, buy that and give this one away to my sister or a friend or someone.  Spending $25 for a ""stop gap"" version of this film isn't that a big of a deal to me, especially since I find this adaption so great and wonderful that I plan on watching it again and again until the EE comes out, which then I'll just rinse and repeat all over again, but with that version instead.",5,An unexpected delight - A Wondeful Film,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1881,"['bar', 'was', 'set', 'pretty', 'high', 'original', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'reach', 'previous', 'levels', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'watching', 'Now', 'people', 'will', 'complain', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'will', 'say', 'reason', 'one', 'book', 'be', 'split', 'up', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'films', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'appreciate', 'everything', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'doing', 'When', 'have', '13', 'dwarves', 'countless', 'other', 'characters', 'enemies', 'introduce', 'explore', 'multiple', 'plot', 'points', 'stories', 'tell', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'cover', 'one', '3', 'hour', 'film', 'why', 'think', 'Jackson', 'decided', 'expand', 'three', 'films', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'money', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'too', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'took', 'time', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'rush', 'right', 'battles', 'chase', 'sequences', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'making', 'audience', 'wait', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'instead', 'introducing', 'characters', 'back', 'story', 'think', 'Jackson', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'here.While', 'do', 'recommend', 'most', 'people', 'waiting', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'film', 'hit', 'Blu-Ray', 'November', 'sometime', 'Fall', 'smart', 'thing', 'do', 'just', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'long', 'watch', 'again', 'hi-def', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'buy', 'version', '5-disc', '3D', 'version', 'now', 'then', 'later', 'year', 'when', 'EE', 'out', 'buy', 'give', 'one', 'away', 'sister', 'friend', 'someone', 'Spending', '25', 'stop', 'gap', 'version', 'film', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'especially', 'find', 'adaption', 'so', 'great', 'wonderful', 'plan', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'EE', 'out', 'then', ""'ll"", 'just', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'version', 'instead']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

When I finally had the opportunity to watch The Hobbit, I was very disappointed; I was confused by how disjointed the movie is. It starts out as sort of a Hobbit: The Musical and introduces us to the main cast of characters, none of whom really distinguish themselves enough for me to identify their personalities. The adventure has a slow start and never gained enough steam to keep me interested. Even the special effects, which were so seamless in the LOTR trilogy, didn't have the same quality. I have not read Tolkein's The Hobbit, so maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had, but I hadn't read The Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw that adaptation, and was able to love it.

1448828,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B0059XTU1S,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[4, 7]","A strange thing happened to me the other night when I watched ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" on Blu-ray in the comfort of my own home. I actually enjoyed it much more than I did seeing it in the theater in its ""intended"" 48 FPS. I'll confess I never gave it a chance in 3D for fear that I might embarrass myself by blowing chunks in the person's hair seated in front of me.Don't get me wrong. There are still many things wrong with Peter Jackson's first entry into his new Middle-earth saga. However, it was easier to be forgiving when viewed in 24 FPS.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure outside his comfort zone of the Shire in the wilds of Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf and his band of dwarves need a master burglar to accompany them on their quest to retake their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they run into a number of different obstacles including orcs, goblins, and a strange creature calling himself Gollum.Re-visiting my earlier theatrical review of the movie, I found opinions of certain aspects swaying a bit. The backstory for the Wizard of the Woods wasn't nearly as tedious as I remembered it being. It was actually quite entertaining and humorous this time around. The CGI wasn't nearly as noticeably awful as it was on the big screen, although there was still an air of artificialness to almost every frame of the film.The biggest problem with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is its structure. I can't shake the feeling that the film has no real rhythm. It's just a series of actions and cause and effects with no real organization.The high-definition transfer is top notch for the most part. I was surprised to notice some banding in one night scene, but that was the only complaint I can think of. The audio is stunning and will please home audiences with its 7.1 surround sound. You'll feel as if you're sitting in the center of Middle-earth, which could be good on a peaceful day in the Shire or bad if you're in the thick of a battle with Gandalf and the dwarves.Bonus material for the Blu-ray version of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is contained on a separate disc from the feature film. They include 127 minutes of ""Behind-the-Scenes"" video blogs addressing everything from location scouting to filming in 3D. There's a tour of New Zealand's countryside, also referred to as the ""Home of Middle-earth."" Six full and alternate trailers are found as well. Trailers for ""Kingdoms of Middle-earth,"" ""Guardians of Middle-earth"" and ""LEGO LOTR"" will excite gaming fans. A Sneak Peek Access Code for ""The Desolation of Smaug"" rounds out the special features.If you had issues with the 48 FPS and 3D presentations of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" I would give it another chance on Blu-ray or DVD. It's a great deal easier on the eyes and doesn't highlight the limitations of the CGI as much as the theatrical viewing experience did. I was pleased with my second trip to early Middle-earth, although I'm fairly certain it will be my last until ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" comes out.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey""",1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,3103,"['strange', 'thing', 'happened', 'other', 'night', 'when', 'watched', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'Blu-ray', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'seeing', 'theater', 'intended', '48', 'FPS', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'never', 'gave', 'chance', '3D', 'fear', 'might', 'embarrass', 'blowing', 'chunks', 'person', 'hair', 'seated', 'front', 'me.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'first', 'entry', 'new', 'Middle-earth', 'saga', 'However', 'was', 'easier', 'be', 'forgiving', 'when', 'viewed', '24', 'FPS', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'story', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'adventure', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Shire', 'wilds', 'Middle-earth', 'wizard', 'Gandalf', 'band', 'dwarves', 'need', 'master', 'burglar', 'accompany', 'quest', 'retake', 'kingdom', 'evil', 'dragon', 'Smaug', 'way', 'run', 'number', 'different', 'obstacles', 'including', 'orcs', 'goblins', 'strange', 'creature', 'calling', 'Gollum.Re-visiting', 'earlier', 'theatrical', 'review', 'movie', 'found', 'opinions', 'certain', 'aspects', 'swaying', 'bit', 'backstory', 'Wizard', 'Woods', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'tedious', 'remembered', 'being', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'time', 'around', 'CGI', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'noticeably', 'awful', 'was', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'artificialness', 'almost', 'frame', 'film.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'structure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'film', 'real', 'rhythm', 'just', 'series', 'actions', 'cause', 'effects', 'real', 'organization.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'surprised', 'notice', 'banding', 'one', 'night', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'think', 'audio', 'stunning', 'will', 'please', 'home', 'audiences', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'center', 'Middle-earth', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'peaceful', 'day', 'Shire', 'bad', ""'re"", 'thick', 'battle', 'Gandalf', 'dwarves.Bonus', 'material', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'contained', 'separate', 'disc', 'feature', 'film', 'include', '127', 'minutes', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'video', 'blogs', 'addressing', 'everything', 'location', 'scouting', 'filming', '3D', 'tour', 'New', 'Zealand', 'countryside', 'also', 'referred', 'Home', 'Middle-earth', 'full', 'alternate', 'trailers', 'are', 'found', 'well', 'Trailers', 'Kingdoms', 'Middle-earth', 'Guardians', 'Middle-earth', 'LEGO', 'LOTR', 'will', 'excite', 'gaming', 'fans', 'Sneak', 'Peek', 'Access', 'Code', 'Desolation', 'Smaug', 'out', 'special', 'features.If', 'had', 'issues', '48', 'FPS', '3D', 'presentations', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'great', 'deal', 'easier', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'limitations', 'CGI', 'as', 'much', 'theatrical', 'viewing', 'experience', 'did', 'was', 'pleased', 'second', 'trip', 'early', 'Middle-earth', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'Hobbit', 'Desolation', 'Smaug', 'out']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

In fact, I really like the movie. In order to avoid confusion, I will review the movie in two parts: the original, and the extended.THE ORIGINALAs previously stated, I really like the theatrical version of the movie. It very much reminded me of the LOTR movies, aside from its goofier tone. I thought that the story was good, the acting was great, the action scenes and special effects were really good, and Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo Baggins. As a person who has actually read the book, I must say that between the two Hobbit movies currently released, this is far superior in terms of accuracy. Not very much was added, but rather reimagined as opposed to the second movie which features things such as a terrible dwarf romance and ridiculously complex action scenes.In terms of complaints, I only have a couple. The first is that there seems to be an overkill on special effects, particularly with the orcs. In the LOTR films, the orcs were actual people with a lot of make up on to look scary. This film, they are pretty much all CGI. The second, is that this film has some cheesy moments. Particularly its ending, which is a little too happy compared to the scene in the book.Theatrical Final Score: 8.7/10THE EXTENDEDThe Extended Edition is where the real problems arise. Unlike the LOTR Extended Editions, the new scenes do nothing to advance the film. Instead, they make the film seem to long and sometimes more cheesy. Particularly, the scene where the dwarfs are naked in the Rivendell fountain, which changed the film's rating, is really unnecessary and stupid. Also, the Goblin King's song is terribly written, unlike some of the other songs in the movie. Though the nine hours of bonus features might be worth it, the overall additions to the picture are pointless.Extended Final Score: 7/10",3,Extended Scenes Aren't Worth It,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1938,"['Okay', 'just', 'clarify', 'score', 'primarily', 'based', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'view', 'actual', 'movie', 'way', 'fact', 'really', 'movie', 'order', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'will', 'review', 'movie', 'two', 'parts', 'original', 'extended.THE', 'ORIGINALAs', 'previously', 'stated', 'really', 'theatrical', 'version', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'reminded', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'aside', 'goofier', 'tone', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'perfect', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'read', 'book', 'must', 'say', 'two', 'Hobbit', 'movies', 'currently', 'released', 'far', 'superior', 'terms', 'accuracy', 'Not', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'added', 'rather', 'reimagined', 'opposed', 'second', 'movie', 'things', 'such', 'terrible', 'dwarf', 'romance', 'ridiculously', 'complex', 'action', 'scenes.In', 'terms', 'complaints', 'only', 'have', 'couple', 'first', 'be', 'overkill', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'orcs', 'LOTR', 'films', 'orcs', 'were', 'actual', 'people', 'lot', 'make', 'up', 'look', 'scary', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'CGI', 'second', 'film', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'Particularly', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'happy', 'compared', 'scene', 'book.Theatrical', 'Final', 'Score', '8.7/10THE', 'EXTENDEDThe', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'where', 'real', 'problems', 'arise', 'LOTR', 'Extended', 'Editions', 'new', 'scenes', 'do', 'nothing', 'advance', 'film', 'Instead', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'long', 'sometimes', 'more', 'cheesy', 'Particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'naked', 'Rivendell', 'fountain', 'changed', 'film', 'rating', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'stupid', 'Also', 'Goblin', 'King', 'song', 'terribly', 'written', 'other', 'songs', 'movie', 'nine', 'hours', 'bonus', 'features', 'might', 'be', 'overall', 'additions', 'picture', 'are', 'pointless.Extended', 'Final', 'Score', '7/10']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

With expectations at an enormous high, a 48fps experiment in tow, and fandom, both literary and cinematic, frothing at the mouth, poised to strike the moment the first film in The Hobbit trilogy showed the slightest sign of weakness, it was bound to disappoint. And yet it shouldn't have. Criticism continues to run the gamut. Too long! Too slow! Too expansive! Like butter scraped over too much bread! Was anyone really that surprised to see Jackson and company indulge a little? Did the decision to stretch two films into three fail to clue anyone into the fact that An Unexpected Journey would be more akin to a Lord of the Rings extended version than a lean, mean theatrical cut? For that matter, are the same people who swear by The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions actually upset with the end result? By some strange, blinding magic: yes, yes and yes.Fortunately, it was only bound to disappoint some fans. There are those among us who chose a different path. Those who were familiar with the quaint, charming tale of &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; enough so to avoid setting Rings-slaying expectations. Who didn't squander our first viewing of An Unexpected Journey by leaping headlong into an entirely new (and arguably distracting) way of watching a film. Who were overjoyed to immerse ourselves in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth once again, for whatever length of time he saw fit. No, The Hobbit isn't perfect.

I hate crowded movie theatres, but I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep until I saw it.  A quote from my friend sum it up nicely.  After dropping her off, I got a phone call.  ""It's four o'clock!  How long was that movie?  I had no idea it was that long cause it just flew by!""  People might have their opinions on how the movie should or shouldn't have been split into three almost 3 hour movies, but the fact is that the movie's pace doesn't really suffer for it.  I like to consider myself open minded to letting the director tell the story he wanted to tell thing the movie is fine how it is.The good news is there is no disputing that the 3D and special effects are the best of any movie to date.  On my Samsung 8000 series, I only saw cross talk during the Riddles in the Dark sequence and only an two or three shots.  And the picture is absolutely stunning.  This is definitely a reference quality Bluray and a welcom addtion to anytone's collection.  It's up there with Avatar as a movie you can show off your tv with.  Also, the sound and music are perfectly executed.  Dialogue is always clear.  And the production diaries do an amazing job of showing how absolutely monumental the task was that Peter Jackson set out to accomplish.  I think military invasions aren't as carefully crafted as this.  Also, for your money you get a 3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, standard DVD, and UV digital copy.  I honestly don't know why some of the reviewers here seem to hate UV or hate the theatrical version.  It's the same movie they saw and loved in theatres so why the hate?

It was like a smorgasbord of the book in living color. Not to see it would be a shame for any Tolkien fan and perhaps once I see the conclusion I might have to give this back the fifth star.

The book The Hobbit itself , lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.The movie actually brings some of these references into the story much more fully, especially the Last White Council, and brings in the great friend of the trees and animals, Radagast the Brown (played by Sylvester McCoy).This movie was certainly as good as The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins , a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf (once again Ian McKellen excels in the role) and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield (played with majesty and gravitas), to wrest the Dwarves lost homeland of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wargs , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world.Each of the Dwarves has its own character and is played with skill and entertainingly so. Great recreation of Rivendell , the reappearance of Hugo Weaving as Elrond and Kate Blanchett as Galadriel. The full grotesque loathsomeness of Orc chieftains such as the revolting Great Goblin (Barry Humphries) and the sheer evil of the Orc king Azog (Manu Bennett). Highlights include Bilbo's encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and the great concluding scene with The Eagles.

1448877,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B0059XTU1S,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","First off, the resolution/visual aspect of this movie is AMAZING. I'm extremely sensitive to the SOE (Soap Opera Effect), and I was dreading this movie, based on the fact that Jackson filmed it at 60 frames per second, and it was widely reported to look ""like a BBC low budget program"". Fortunately, this is not the case. I have no idea what Jackson did, but this looks absolutely incredible (even more so than LOTR), and there is no SOE whatsoever that I could detect. This is probably the most visually dynamic movie I've ever seen... it simply ""pops"" off of the screen in an incredible fashion. I watched it on Blu-ray, no 3d, on a 1080p 47"" LG. Not sure if the refresh rate of my own TV impacted the ultimate delivery of the movie (it's essentially a 60Hz, though it's advertised as 120Hz ""TruMotion""), but I would certainly recommend all viewers adjust their TVs to 60Hz if they are sensitive to the SOE, like me- the results will take your breath away.This movie deserves props for some truly inventive notions brought to life, such as a crazed woodland wizard riding about on a sleigh pulled by giant rabits, an elf lord traipsing about on a moose (or elk?), and one of the most incredibly goblin riots of all time. However, much like ""Pan's Labrynth"", I'm not sure if you ever want your kids to watch this one, unless you fancy the notion of them waking up screaming in the middle of the night... there are some terrifying creatures in this movie that will haunt the lil' ones' dreams, most notable being the orc chief and the goblin king (not sure if those are their proper titles, but you get the idea). The goblin king, in particular, is an extremely disturbing critter that shows off some amazing CG chops by whoever created him. And of courser, Gollum is back, and he's perhaps freakier than ever, and more than enough to instill nightmares all by his lonesome.What came as a great surprise to me was that (young) Bilbo Baggins was so likable. In fact, he's FAR more likable than Frodo was in the LOTR series. Frodo spent most of his movies whining and crying, all whilst he twisted his face into an agonized visage, just in case you weren't sure of how miserable he was. I realize he drew a short straw, but when compared to Bilbo, he seems like an irredeemable crybaby. Instead of complaining and lamenting his fate, Bilbo embraces his unwanted quest and barrels into it with a headfull of steam, embracing those who doubt and dislike him. He's kind, generous, and irrepressible, and this turns him into the most lovable protagonist that has ever graced a LOTR film.I only knock off one star for some pacing issues (which has become something of Jackson's hallmark). However, rest assured- if you're an LOTR nerd (and I know there's a LOT of you out there), you will love this movie like nobody's business, and it will be a five star must-buy for you. For me, however, the movie dragged too much in the middle, and it actually felt like a three hour movie, as opposed to something like ""The Avengers"" or the Batman movies, which were more aggressively paced, and didn't feel like three hours to me (relax, LOTR nerds, it's just my opinion).Nonetheless, this is a fantastic fantasy film, by any measure. Watch it in HD, turn it up, join the dwarves, and begin your own ""Unexpected Journey""!",4,"Gollum is back, and he's perhaps freakier than ever, and more than enough to instill nightmares all by his lonesome",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3304,"['First', 'off', 'resolution/visual', 'aspect', 'movie', 'AMAZING', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'SOE', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'Effect', 'was', 'dreading', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'Jackson', 'filmed', '60', 'frames', 'second', 'was', 'widely', 'reported', 'look', 'BBC', 'low', 'budget', 'program', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'case', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Jackson', 'did', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'LOTR', 'SOE', 'could', 'detect', 'probably', 'most', 'visually', 'dynamic', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'simply', 'pops', 'screen', 'incredible', 'fashion', 'watched', 'Blu-ray', '3d', '1080p', '47', 'LG', 'Not', 'sure', 'refresh', 'rate', 'own', 'TV', 'impacted', 'ultimate', 'delivery', 'movie', 'essentially', '60Hz', 'advertised', '120Hz', 'TruMotion', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'adjust', 'TVs', '60Hz', 'are', 'sensitive', 'SOE', 'me-', 'results', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away.This', 'movie', 'props', 'truly', 'inventive', 'notions', 'brought', 'life', 'such', 'crazed', 'woodland', 'wizard', 'riding', 'sleigh', 'pulled', 'giant', 'rabits', 'elf', 'lord', 'traipsing', 'moose', 'elk', 'one', 'most', 'incredibly', 'goblin', 'riots', 'time', 'However', 'much', 'Pan', 'Labrynth', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'want', 'kids', 'watch', 'one', 'fancy', 'notion', 'waking', 'up', 'screaming', 'middle', 'night', 'are', 'terrifying', 'creatures', 'movie', 'will', 'haunt', 'lil', 'ones', 'dreams', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'orc', 'chief', 'goblin', 'king', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'proper', 'titles', 'get', 'idea', 'goblin', 'king', 'particular', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'critter', 'amazing', 'CG', 'chops', 'created', 'courser', 'Gollum', 'back', 'perhaps', 'freakier', 'ever', 'more', 'enough', 'instill', 'nightmares', 'lonesome.What', 'came', 'great', 'surprise', 'was', 'young', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'was', 'so', 'likable', 'fact', 'FAR', 'more', 'likable', 'Frodo', 'was', 'LOTR', 'series', 'Frodo', 'spent', 'most', 'movies', 'whining', 'crying', 'whilst', 'twisted', 'face', 'agonized', 'visage', 'just', 'case', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'miserable', 'was', 'realize', 'drew', 'short', 'straw', 'when', 'compared', 'Bilbo', 'irredeemable', 'crybaby', 'Instead', 'complaining', 'lamenting', 'fate', 'Bilbo', 'unwanted', 'quest', 'barrels', 'headfull', 'steam', 'embracing', 'who', 'doubt', 'dislike', 'kind', 'generous', 'irrepressible', 'most', 'lovable', 'protagonist', 'ever', 'graced', 'LOTR', 'film.I', 'only', 'knock', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'pacing', 'issues', 'become', 'something', 'Jackson', 'hallmark', 'However', 'rest', 'assured-', ""'re"", 'LOTR', 'nerd', 'know', 'LOT', 'there', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'nobody', 'business', 'will', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'must-buy', 'however', 'movie', 'dragged', 'too', 'much', 'middle', 'actually', 'felt', 'three', 'hour', 'movie', 'opposed', 'something', 'Avengers', 'Batman', 'movies', 'were', 'more', 'aggressively', 'paced', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'three', 'hours', 'relax', 'LOTR', 'nerds', 'just', 'opinion', '.Nonetheless', 'fantastic', 'fantasy', 'film', 'measure', 'Watch', 'HD', 'turn', 'up', 'join', 'dwarves', 'begin', 'own', 'Unexpected', 'Journey']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1448887,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B0059XTU1S,Georgio Alfani,"[34, 125]","TO ALL YOU FAN BOYS: The button says ""Was this review helpful? NOT do you agree?"" losers!SPOILERS WARNINGIt's such a shame that ""The Hobbit"" ended up being a drawn-out, bloated, boring mess that lacks compelling characters and an engaging story. This film is a complete and utter travesty. I had a really bad feeling about this movie when i saw the trailer, even though i loved the LOTR. When i saw the trailer i feared that the film makers and studio were milking this franchise by turning The Hobbit into a trilogy and that the final products would be filled with TOO MUCH FILLER and that it would ruin the movie.Sorry to say people, i was right....The first half of this film feels like a collage of deleted scenes that should have stayed deleted or waited until the extended cut dvd.I usually hate those people that text during films but my God, was i happy to have my cell phone during that first horrible, boring, monotonous first hour. THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THIS FILM 3 HOURS!!!!! The studio is just trying to make a buck and as a result the integrity of the film suffers. There's too much filler in this film...too much ""easter eggs"" that remind you of how great LOTR were.They might as well run a text prompt on the bottom of the screen like the news channels saying:""Remember LOTR? that was so great. We're trying to recreate the same feeling again, so we will be making lots of meaningless references to those films throughout that have nothing to do with advancing the plot for this movie. Hey, that dwarf king dude is kinda like Aragon, huh? Hey look, it's Galadriel and Elrond. Doesn't this scene feel like the one from Fellowship of the Ring, when Galadriel gave Frodo the gifts and elf bread? REMEMBER LOTR?! THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!!THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!!THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!! ISN'T IT SO COOL. THAT MAKES THIS FILM A MASTERPIECE OUT THE BOX!SO GIVE US YOUR MONEY AND BUY ALL THINGS HOBBIT! AND DISLIKE ALL CUSTOMER REVIEWS THAT DON'T AGREE US....repeat prompt""The first half of the film is so boring that by the time they go on the adventure..i forgot why the hell their even setting out on this journey...and i've read the book!""Why the hell are these dwarf idiots so important and why are we going on this journey? OH YEAH! BECAUSE OF THE DRAGON AND THEIR GOLD"" I had this thought like 3 times during the screening.Each LOTR film can stand on it's own but not this boring piece of crap. And it has nothing to do with the Hobbit book, which i love. This film should have been one 3 and half hour epic film, not 3 films. It's ridiculous!! People talk down a lot about the Star Wars prequels but I'd watch Phantom Menace any day over this horrid piece of boring junk.The Hobbit is 287 pages. So it;'s completely idiotic and  pure greed for money that they made this into 3, 3 hour films. In the book, the Dwarves have left Bilbo's and Bilbo runs out on his adventure in 17 pages. Peter Jackson takes a HOUR to get the journey started with a whole half hour of ""put that down, don't break that, leave that alone, will you stop, no you can't do that, what are you doing, please stop!""STOP, PLEASE! WE GET IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The dwarfs are unwanted by Bilbo, stop hitting it over the head just to fill up time!The bizarre, unfunny, slapstick humor is painful. This involves snot jokes, burping, poop hair, and lame one-liners. Don't give me the ""it's based on a children's book"" crap. Sure, the source material was written for children but I'm talking about the movie. Adding all this stupid humor really messes with the tone; it doesn't feel like it belongs in the LOTR universe which ""The Hobbit"" is trying so hard replicate. The film will go from trying to be epic to pathetic gags. It doesn't work. I don't mind a little humor occasionally but this is just overdone and it makes the film feel very unbalanced.Radagast's involvement is pointless and his bunny sled is ridiculous. We also get to see Saruman and Galadriel in a boring scene that has absolutely no relevance to the main narrative. Wait, what exactly is ""The Hobbit"" about again? Apparently Jackson is trying to make connections with LOTR, but ""Fellowship of the Ring"" already explains past events pretty well. Seriously, all the LOTR fanboy pleasing scenes could have been left out (including Frodo). But no, we need them in order to have enough material for the trilogy. Not good.And I understand that Jackson is taking material from the appendices of LOTR. I wouldn't have a problem with this if all these extra scenes actually advanced the plot. But the White Council just talks and they never decide to act on anything. Also, that scene has NOTHING to do with the dwarves reclaiming their homeland. At least in ""Fellowship"" the plot makes major advancements but in ""The Hobbit"" the story hardly goes anywhere. BORING!For the first 20 minutes we get all this old Bilbo recollecting his adventures and seeing Elijah Wood and all these unnecessary references to LOTR just to buy time to make this 3 hours. They try too hard to tie this film into LOTR, just in hope that some of its greatness will rub off.The first 10 minutes of the film goes like this: T...  H...  E...The next 10 go like this: H...o...b...The next 10 go like this b....i....t...30 minutes just for the titles!!!The next half hour is Bilbo picking up a pencil.....THEN IT TAKES ANOTHER 30 MINUTES JUST FOR HIM TO WRITE ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit...."" THE FIRST WORDS IN THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Greed for cash ruined this story. Period. I won't even bother to see the next two. And like an idiot I gave away the 1977 animated film because I THOUGHT for sure this would blow that away. Boy, was I wrong. Time to place my Amazon order for that again...I will admit that the scenes with Golumn and the Goblin King were great but scenes don't make a good movie",1,They RUINED IT!!!!,1357516800,"01 7,

1448917,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B0059XTU1S,Graves,"[3, 3]","Fans of Tolkien can argue about Peter Jackson&#8217;s handling of the beloved stories of Middle Earth, what he left out or changed, but no one has accused him of getting in &#8216;wrong.&#8217; And considering the legions of fans all working from books that is a heck of a thing.  A fan himself Jackson treats Tolkien&#8217;s works with the love and respect any fan would hope for.After 3 Lord of the Rings films fans were looking forward to The Hobbit, the first prequel to LotR&#8217;s in which we see a younger Bilbo Baggins get swept up in an adventure with the wizard Gandalf and a troop of dwarves to rescue their home land from the dragon Smaug who captured it years ago.As with his earlier films Jackson does not disappoint. Ian McKellan returns as the wizard and Martin Freeman, known to most as Dr Watson from Sherlock, is wonderful as the easily flustered, fish out of water gentle hobbit who finds himself in the wilds.That having been said if you bought the dvd of the Hobbit when it first came out 6 months ago, sad to say, there really isn&#8217;t a reason to buy the extended version. With the three LotR films Jackson was unsure of his audience so the theatrical releases were only 2 hours long, with his true vision coming through on the 3 hour long versions released on DVD. It was worth it to buy those. With the first of the &#8216;Hobbit&#8217; films though Jackson knew what he had and that audiences would support him. It was about 3 hours long and when I heard &#8216;extended version&#8217; one can rightly ask  &#8220;what the heck extra was there?&#8221;A VERY brief scene of the young Bilbo meeting Gandalf.There is a scene of a flustered Bilbo in a market in Hobbiton and I&#8217;m not really sure why it was included, it was obvious why it was cut.A little more, a very little more, development of some of the dwarves who got little exposure in the film version.A bit more development of Rivendell, the elven strong hold which plays up the dwarves being someone uncouth compared with their hosts, an over heard conversation between Gandalf and Elrond where they see this as a move in a long war against Sauron, not just a quest for its own sake, and a conversation between Bilbo and the elf lord Elrond.Lastly a song by the goblin king about being down in goblin town, yes it was in the book but on the screen you suddenly feel like it&#8217;s a 1940&#8217;s B film that HAS to have a musical number shoehorned in.The behind the scenes discs are interesting if you haven&#8217;t seen them on the original LotR&#8217;s discs but if you have seen those older ones there really isn&#8217;t too much new on these.Still my point is Jackson has once more created a beautiful version of the works of Tolkien that any fan would be happy to own and if you didn&#8217;t buy the original version when it came out but held out for the extended version, then YES buy it, you&#8217;ll love it.

Approaching the Hobbit in what seems to be so soon following the monumental 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was simply courageous.  Expectations are immeasurable.  Individual demands are often impossible to meet.

1448924,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B0059XTU1S,Grimluke,"[0, 0]","After watching (and loving) the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was ready for this epic franchise to be continued with film adaptions of the beloved prequel, ""The Hobbit."" When that first trailer was released, I became extremely excited! I even read the original book so that when I would see the movie, I would be able to determine if it was accurate or not, and reading the book made me even more excited because of how good it was (it's now one of my favorite books of all time)! Then the reviews came.... wow. I was shocked at how low the reviews were compared to the LOTR films. That lowered expectations quite a bit, but I still went to see it in theaters anyway. Let me tell you this, it was worth seeing TWICE, and here's my breakdown of the film:Story: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins reluctantly joins 13 dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf on a journey to the Lonely Mountain to take back the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the gold-loving dragon Smaug. On the way, he encounters many challenges such as trolls, orcs, and a creature who lurks in the dark obsessing over a golden ring with dark powers. It's a very interesting plot (it doesn't sound that cool when I write in this review, though), and it follows the original book's plot very well. There are some changes, but the only big difference is the added subplot about a pale orc named Azog who hunts Bilbo and the others on their quest to the Lonely Mountain. I don't particularly like this addition, but it doesn't lower my opinion of the movie that much.Acting: The acting was very good. Returning actors such as Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Christopher Lee (Saruman), and Hugo Weaving (Elrond) are just as good as they were in the Lord of the Rings movies. Newcomers are good too, but Martin Freeman's Bilbo really steals the show. Gollum (who was in the previous movies) is a CGI character instead of using a real actor, but his voice acting really shines like in the LOTR films.Writing: The major difference between this movie and the Lord of the Rings movies is that it's more light-hearted, which isn't a bad thing considering that the book was more light-hearted as well. It's a lot more comedic than LOTR, but it pretty much always succeeds at being funny. The only part where the writing felt a little cheesy, was the ending. It was... really happy... a little TOO happy. It didn't bother me that much, but just be warned that this isn't nearly as gritty as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When it's trying to be serious, it also tends to succeed, so I'd say that the writing is better than most movies these days.Special Effects: Great, but I think they need to cut back on using CGI. It almost feels less real to watch than the Lord of the Rings movies, considering that those movies used costumes for their orcs instead of animating them like in this movie.Costumes: Peter Jackson's movies about Middle-Earth have great costumes. They make dwarves, elves, and hobbits seem believable. I like to think that if someone ever made a high-budget Legend of Zelda movie, it would look like (and overall be made like) these movies.Pacing: Many people complain about how long this movie is. I think it was too long, but they made great use of that time. I can't really think of a scene in particular that was too long, it's just when you put all of those scenes together it makes a really long movie.Verdict: I consider The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey to be a complete success. It was a little bit more awkward than the films before it, but it certainly does NOT deserve a 58 on Metacritic. I think people are too focused on comparing this movie to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which makes this film seem low-quality. If they looked at this film purely based on its own quality, I bet they'd realize that they had been a little too hard on it.UPDATE: I saw the movie again, and I started to notice some flaws that I hadn't seen before (mostly on how cheesy it is).

But when I saw The Desolation of Smaug in the theater, I found justification for choosing this slashed-price bare-bones release of The Hobbit over the much more expensive extended cut. First, I wanted to save money. I think the extended releases will be cheaper down the road when the project is finished. Second, I don't think I'm going to like the extended cuts very much. &#34;The Hobbit&#34; is not like &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; - ironically, because it's too much like The Lord of the Rings and not enough like its source. Up to this point, with all the material that's been added in by the writers, not enough feels authentic to me. Instead, it feels borrowed from the LotR movies. I don't just mean that it's not what Tolkien intended. Rather, I mean that the story seems to lack the emotional weight and inner life of the LotR films (which, in my opinion, largely surpassed Tolkien's work despite the subtractions that took place). What was imported into Tolkien's story here was only imported superficially. I hope that time and a complete trilogy will give me a better perspective.I think &#34;The Hobbit: A.U.J.&#34; works very well for what it is - an action-adventure film. It seems much more a prequel to the LotR movies than an attempt to be faithful to Tolkien's children's book. I only hope this trilogy doesn't get carried away in that regard. So far, it is going a bit too far for me to rate even this first movie and its Blu-ray release five stars.

In addition to adding back scenes that were cut for the theatrical release (which other reviewers have mentioned), there are an amazing 3 discs of bonus coverage totaling almost 9 hours.Just as J.R.R. Tolkien had appendices to his books, Jackson's movies have appendices. These extraordinary ""making of"" features for ""The Hobbit"" carry on the numbering from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The extended edition release for ""Return of the King"" ended with Appendices Part 6.  So ""The Hobbit"" begins with Appendices Part 7.These are extraordinarily detailed glimpses into the creation of this movie from the very beginning to the very end. Long before any actors were notified, they worked on production design and concepts. Character designs and concepts. Scripts were changed right up to the day of shooting. Motion-capture was brought to new levels. Costuming and the decisions that went into it are fascinating!You see clips from rehearsals and clips from rushes. Clips from meetings and makeup and why this was done instead of that. Very often, they start with quotes from Tolkien, how he described something/someone, and how Jackson (writer/director/coproducer) could work off of that. Commentators include every actor and I think just about everybody on the crew, too, from the concept creature sculptor to the animation technician desperately trying to finish Azog almost right up to the day of the New Zealand World Premiere!  You will not be bored by watching these many hours of extra features.All features can be listened to in English.

But as The Hobbit is shot in 3D, that system doesn't work.Alex Funke (motion control supervisor) describes how it was done for The Hobbit: ""The only way we can make a person bigger is to put the camera closer to him. So, effectively,[in the dinner scene in Frodo's home]  we have a camera that looks at the dwarves and Bilbo in a set built to their scale. And a camera that looks at Gandalf, on a green screen, which is 25% closer to him"" on a smaller scale kitchen set. Except it isn't really a set, because everything is draped in green fabric. The two cameras are synchronized, but McKellen could not hear anything on the other set. This was very disconcerting at first, and when you look at the conditions, it's amazing it works. It's touching as McKellen describes how he was so upset after the 1st day of shooting in the green-room Bag End, that he considered he'd have to leave the movie!Ikhf id ursu Khazad(Feel the fire of the Dwarves)Nevui penim miruvor(We are almost out of wine)C.

But, I tried to do it in a sympathetic way!""BONUS DISC 2 continuation of The Appendices Part 7A.  A Long Expected Journey - The Chronicles of The Hobbit Part 1 (total 2 hrs, 21 minutes)You can watch the nine parts individually or ""play all""7........Over Hill  -  The Misty Mountains8........Under Hill  -  Goblin Town9........Out of the Frying Pan - The Forest Ledge10......Return to Hobbiton  -  The Shire11......The Epic of Scene 88 -  Strath Taieri12......The Battle of Moria  -  Azanulbizar13......Edge of the Wilderland  -  Pick-Up and The Carrock14......Home is Behind, The World Ahead15......CreditsTim Wong (assistant stunt coordinator) talks about the stunt which sends Bilbo and the dwarves tumbling down into Goblin Town: ""The trap door stunt, which leads to the Goblin caves, was probably the most intricate and dangerous stunt that I've ever been part of.""Peter Jackson does a cameo in all his films.  This time he is a refugee dwarf in a long dark beard. Did you see him passing Thorin at a run?Last, but not least, you are given a lovely preview of the 2nd movie, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", including a sneak peek of Benedict Cumberbatch in his facial motion capture get-up, breathing fire (figuratively).B.  Realms of the Third Age: From Bag End to Goblin Town (total 1 hour)You can watch the five parts individually or ""play all""1.......Hobbiton2.......Rhosgobel (Radagast's home)3.......Rivendell4.......The Misty Mountains5.......Goblin TownThis feature focuses on the sets and locations.Peter Jackson says at the beginning, ""It was important visually, with 'The Hobbit', that it feels like a slightly more idyllic time. I mean, the darkness that descends on this world in Lord of the Rings is brewing, but it hasn't yet expanded to the levels it's going to.""For the Ring trilogy, most of Hobbiton was made of styrofoam and torn down afterwards. And still tourists made pilgrimages. This time around, they built the Hobbit holes and structures as in real life. They are made to last. Now you really can visit a Bag End.BONUS DISC 3  The Appendices Part 8Return to Middle EarthYou can watch the four parts individually or ""play all""A.  The Company of Thorin  (1 hour 10 minutes)Tolkien's books don't give a lot of definition for many of the dwarf personalities. For a movie, though, each of the dwarves in the party has to have his own characteristics, which drives his costume and weapons. So it was left to Jackson & Team, as well as the actors to fill everything in.  Adam Brown (plays Ori) says: ""This is my first movie. I thought I'd aim high!""B.  Mr. Baggins - The 14th Member (16 minutes)Ian Mckellen, the old pro, says of Martin Freeman: ""His most remarkable quality as an actor is to be able, with absolute clarity, to convey that he's thinking two things at the same time.""C.  Durin's Folk: Creating the Dwarves (7 minutes)Richard Armitage (plays Thorin) went through many mutations on his costuming: ""Tolkien described Thorin as having a full beard that he tucked into his belt. We have had to depart from that. I know this is controversial, because the King of the the Long Beards, people felt he should have a long beard.""Graham McTavish (plays the bulkier, even for a dwarf, Dwalin): ""I just thought that Dwalin would have names for his axes. Because he's that kind of guy. I remembered that Emily Br&ouml;nte had two dogs called Grasper and Keeper.... What an extraordinary pair of names."" And they became the names of his axes.D.  The Peoples and Denizens of Middle Earth (total 2 hours)You can watch the four parts individually or ""play all""1........The Stone Trolls2........Radagast the Brown3........Goblins4........Azog the DefilerSylvester McCoy plays the wizard Radagast, who's practically turned into a forest creature himself. McCoy didn't learn he had to say a spell in formal Elvish until he got on set. McCoy says, ""They tell me when I first arrive, and I misheard, and I thought it was Elvis."" And he goes into an Elvis impersonation. He is better at the ElviSH.In the book, Azog apparently dies of his injury at Thorin's hand, in the Battle for Moria. With a little artistic license, they brought him back for 'The Hobbit', lusting for Thorin's head. Manu Bennet, the actor who's motion capture was used for Azog, talks about his character: ""The necessary thing that Peter wanted from Azog was what we Maori call mana, the size of the guy, the spiritual strength of the character.""",5,Fabulous NINE HOURS of Bonus Features on the Extended Edition!,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,8384,"['Peter', 'Jackson', 'extended', 'editions', 'are',

We've already seen orcs (not depicted although vaguely mentioned in the book), we've seen Galadriel (not depicted in the book), we've seen Saruman (ditto); we've seen giant eagles (in the book but not until the end), giant spiders (ditto) and the Sting (ditto).  And although we hadn't seen trolls in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (or did we?  I think I spotted some in the dark army in ""Return of the King""?), there was nothing scary or funny or remotely interesting about them.As for the company of dwarves, their depiction here is something like a cartoon Braveheart.  My gut reaction was, ""Trust Tolkien (Anglo-Saxon snob) to give the boorish creatures Scottish accents"", then I remembered - he didn't.  Peter Jackson and his company of screenwriters did.  How cliche'.No, I wasn't looking at my watch after the first ten minutes, really I wasn't.  I was looking at my lap because the 48 bit frame rate made the sweeping landscapes blurry and headache-inducing.Spoiler alerts:  How do you turn a single volume whimsical childrens' story into a 9 hour trilogy of films?  By stretching  every  single  scene  out  a  very  very  long  time  and then putting in a bunch of stuff from other Tolkien books and other movies based on other Tolkien books and...well, a whole lot of other stuff you just made up!

1448964,A16ALBDRKYUZ15,B0059XTU1S,Hugh Claffey,"[20, 93]","I was looking forward to this. We went as a family for Christmas , my eighty year old mother, my wife and four kids -  our seventeen year old movie-buff came under protest.  Oh dear!  At one point when the trolls were discussing what seasoning to eat the dwarves with, I looked around, my mum was asleep, my wife was asleep, my daughter mouthed her favourite put down - `Fail'.Why so bad?  I think the movie lacks an interesting narrative and a credible hero, as well as which, if you liked the Ring movies (which all my family did) you are very familiar with the special effects - when the dwarves are hanging from a tree over a cliff, Gandalf grabs a butterfly and whispers to it before releasing it.  We all know the eagles are being sent for, and instead of tension wondering how the dwarves will escape, I got irritated that the eagles might not show up on time.The narrative is very thin, the scene where the dwarves arrive in Bibo's house and he is reluctant to join them on their adventure went on forever, the trolls trying to eat the dwarves, much too long. The stone giants reminded me of the tree-people in the Ring.  Ok, I can understand  the journey to see if the homeland is habitable, but only if the heroes are sympathetic.  I guess I didn't warm to the dwarves,  first there are too many of them - 13? , then they seem to have rhyming names - Bing and Bong, Ding and Dong, and none of them get killed (so far) so its hard to get invested in any of them.The accents (for UK/Irish viewers) have moved around a bit - the dwarves seem to have Scottish or Northumbrian accents ( though James Nesbitt keeps his neutral Norn' Ireland accent) ; the trolls have stolen the Cockney accents that the Orks had in the last series of movies, and the Orks have now got so inhuman that they need subtitles.  This probably doesn't matter to an international audience, but it grates on me. Also Gandalf and Cate Blanchett are purely wasted in this movie.Towards the end Bilbo says `I think the worst is over',  an almost soap-opera link to the next movie.

1448972,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B0059XTU1S,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","Here's Peter Jackson's long awaited follow up to the universally acclaimed Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the Hobbit, which is only one book, that's stretched out into the same amount of time. Why? Because f***ing $$$ that's why. But stretching it out adds a lot of problems, namely, filler. And adding in filler into a movie like this kills a lot of other things, the humor feels tacked on and forced, the action scenes are unnecessary and boring, and overall it's just a bad combination.So obviously everyone involved is super passionate about making the Hobbit, which saves it in many aspects. You can just tell Ian Mckellen is glad to be in his wizard costume again, the dwarves put their all into their roles, and Martin Freeman plays a perfect Bilbo, showing his initial trepidation slowly transforms into full blown commitment to the mission. The huge budget also works, the scenery is gorgeous as always and if anything works better as a big 3 hour postcard from New Zealand.But there are many problems to consider, the most obvious one was the aforementioned 'filler'. Many scenes just run on too long and feel like it's going nowhere, the most notable example is the troll scene. Before the actual part, we have to watch the 'suspense' of Bilbo lurking around their campfire, with Bilbo almost being caught by the trolls multiple times. All the while this is going on the trolls are talking like the three stooges with limey accents, and the whole time this scene was going on I just felt like Peter Jackson was saying ""we know this scene goes nowhere, but look at the funny trolls and the suspense!"" I felt neither except for my ass getting sore.Another thing that annoyed me was when the wizards and elves got together on their big meeting. Some of the stuff they talked about was legit, like how Smaug is a major potential threat they should neutralize, but keep in mind, this is before Lord of the Rings, so how about we see a different side of their relationship? It was kinda cool seeing Gandalf and Galadriel meet, even though it seemed like they were sleeping around with each other. But then Saruman comes in, and he's the same prick we knew from Lord of the Rings. I mean I get that he'll become a villain, but can't we at least see some comradely between him and Gandalf? Instead he talks down to Gandalf, and Gandalf just rolls his eyes at Saruman. C'mon! They were friends! They warmly greeted each other in Fellowship, so showing a friendly side of Saruman would've been fine! In fact it could've showcased the great evil coming more, in that it corrupted their most powerful wizard! But noooo. That was a big missed opportunity in my opinion, if your going to show these characters again in a movie that doesn't focus around them, at least bring a new side to it.Then there was the head dwarf, who was literally just Aragon 2.0. He is the same quiet stoic badass leader of the group, and he goes so far as to even give off the same Bambi eyes throughout the film. Many times you'll see him and it looks like he's about to cry or something, and all we saw of him in this film was either silently being a badass or looking like he's going to cry for no reason at all. The main scene where Aragon looks like he was about to cry was the scene where I looked like I was about to cry the first time I saw it, when him and Frodo understood they had to part ways, and in complete silence, Aragon tells Frodo that he would've followed him to the very end. Now that was a powerful scene, because the entire film built up to it with more than just Aragon thinking Frodo is a pussy. In fact the entire scene of the fellowship disbanding in the first movie was pure cinematic gold, powerful scenes which added depth to fantasy characters, something almost unheard of. But what do we have here? An albino goblin mocks the main characters' dad or something, much less of an impact there. Though the actor probably did all he could but he was written poorly and was probably the least interesting character in the film. The other dwarves don't have much personality to them, and just like the book, distinguishing them apart was challenging, however the make-up department does a good job of making them look different.Another thing was how many big action sequences feel lifted out of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The warg chase in the open plains felt reminiscent of the Two Towers (they even retain scouts), the scene with them getting out of the mountain after being chased by a bunch of goblins felt like the Moria scene from Fellowship (I think they even have a scene where a few of the dwarves are stuck on an unsteady platform), and other would be the eagles saving everyone. I know some of this stuff was in the books, but it felt like I've seen it all before, and hopefully those are the last scenes reminiscent of Lord of the Rings scenes (I forgot the book, I read it like 10 years ago).Then there was the scene where they're crossing the mountains and it turns into a giant mountains fight. From the books I thought they saw it at a distance or something, but here they're right on the rock giant's legs, I mean why? So we can have more action? That's the problem with this film, it never really feels like a world like Lord of the Rings did, because there's too much sporadic unnecessary action, and not enough time where the film calms down a bit and lets you soak Middle Earth in. Case in point is the pointless mountain giant fight where the dwarves are right in the middle of it.Also the goblins seem much less threatening this time around, however that makes sense, because the Hobbit isn't as dark as Lord of the Rings, so I guess a cartoon King Goblin making silly jokes makes sense. I just remember how in Moria they looked like demons, and here they look like cartoon bad guys. The Riddles in the Dark scene was well done, and surprisingly they didn't drag that one out. The ending was sorta heartwarming, where the dwarves accept Bilbo, it was like now we were getting somewhere with the characters instead of seeing them fight all the time like video game characters.Overall the Hobbit isn't a bad film, but it's also no where near the heights that Lord of the Rings were at, but as I stated, Lord of the Rings is more serious and heavier than the Hobbit. So if they embraced that this film is more kid friendly, instead of mixing it up with some darker LOTR prophecy stuff, and if they trimmed it down to just two 3 hour movies instead, and come out with an extended edition later, it would've been much better. But then again they would make 1/3rd less profit, so that won't happen. So at the end we have an enjoyable fantasy that feels a little bloated.",3,Good but disappointing,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,6688,"['Here', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'long', 'awaited', 'follow', 'up',

1448973,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B0059XTU1S,Indy Reviewer,"[15, 28]","There's been a lot written both positive and negative about ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", but most of it misses the point.  All the talk about CGI and 48 fps and pacing and running time and the inclusion of material from Tolkien's other works is interesting, but the core problem is that the movie simply can't overcome taking about 25 minutes worth of plot and stretching it into a movie running 2 hours and 49 minutes.  It's a shame since there are some sit-up straight moments during those 25 minutes, but unfortunately the exercise doesn't fully succeed.  3 stars.It is a fantastic treat for fans that Peter Jackson decided to return to the world of Middle Earth and explore it a little more.  Unexpected Journey is not an awful film - it's certainly not Phantom Menace, which is what it will likely be compared to by some detractors - but it is not a great one either.For those familiar with the book, the movie covers about a third of it, up to the pinecone tree battle.  Part of Jackson's problem here is that in the narrative, not all that much happens during that time.  More than anything else, the company is more or less just moving around, walking in on random parts of Middle Earth while on the way to visit Smaug.Jackson attempts to make a movie out of this in three ways.  First, he brings in elements of Tolkien's later work, building on the rise of Sauron and what characters from the later books are doing during the Hobbit.  This is actually a pretty reasonable adaptation; the cameos of Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond are worthwhile, and the addition of Radagast is slightly silly but still interesting.  (It also makes for a great inside joke about the Blue wizards for those familiar with what Tolkien wrote.)  Sauron's presence isn't written about in the Hobbit, but Jackson's decision to include how his rise begins here makes sense.The other two ways create more problems.  First, he drastically embellishes the tale of what ends up being a composite of Azog and Bolg from the Hobbit, making him into the main antagonist and creating numerous plot devices around him.  Second, he turns the tangential coming-of-age tale of the overall Hobbit into a direct coming-of-age tale of Bilbo gaining the acceptance of a distrustful Thorin.Most of these latter two story lines come through battle sequences, and the problem is that Jackson ends up filling much of the movie with them.  Unfortunately, this progresses to the point where it the repeated CGI sequences end up almost boring as they merely act as filler for the rest of the plot not advancing.  In doing so, Jackson seems to have missed why adapting the Battle of Helm's Deep as the central plot element in The Two Towers worked so well.  Non-canon characters and story fit perfectly well when they tie together loose ends and advance the main plot.  When they and their battles basically become the main plot as they do for the better part of 2 hours here, any movie would suffer.The saving grace of the movie is the few scenes that do advance the plot.  The one gem in the entire movie that equals the quality with the original trilogy is the riddle sequence between Gollum and Bilbo, where Serkis and Freeman nail the most important sequence in the entire prequel.  If the rest of the movie lived up to that quality, this would have been fantastic.Finally, as far as the 48 fps debate, it's overblown.  The simple way to think of it is like watching a 120 Hz or 240 Hz TV with upconverting and smoothness on; the video quality improves dramatically, but it feels much like watching a video instead of TV.  It's probably worth watching in 48 fps for the novelty of doing so, but not much more than that.Jackson's source material is a bit more robust for the next two films, so it'll be interesting to see what he comes up with.  However, the bottom line remains that if he wants to make a three hour movie, he'll need three hours of plot material next time.  3 stars.",3,25 minutes of plot does not make a 2 3/4 hour movie,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,3955,"['been', 'lot', 'written', 'positive', 'negative', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'most', 'point', 'talk', 'CGI', '48', 'fps', 'pacing', 'running', 'time', 'inclusion', 'material', 'Tolkien', 'other', 'works', 'interesting', 'core', 'problem', 'movie', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'taking', '25', 'minutes', 'plot', 'stretching', 'movie', 'running', '2', 'hours', '49', 'minutes', 'shame', 'are', 'sit-up', 'straight', 'moments', '25', 'minutes', 'unfortunately', 'exercise', ""n't"", 'fully', 'succeed', '3', 'stars.It', 'fantastic', 'treat', 'fans', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'decided', 'return', 'world', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'explore', 'little', 'more', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'not', 'awful', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'what', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'compared', 'detractors', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'either.For', 'familiar', 'book', 'movie', 'third', 'up', 'pinecone', 'tree', 'battle', 'Part', 'Jackson', 'problem', 'here', 'narrative', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'happens', 'time', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'company', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'moving', 'around', 'walking', 'random', 'parts', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'way', 'visit', 'Smaug.Jackson', 'attempts', 'make', 'movie', 'three', 'ways', 'First', 'elements', 'Tolkien', 'later', 'work', 'building', 'rise', 'Sauron', 'what', 'characters', 'later', 'books', 'are', 'doing', 'Hobbit', 'actually', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'adaptation', 'cameos', 'Saruman', 'Galadriel', 'Elrond', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'Radagast', 'slightly', 'silly', 'still', 'interesting', 'also', 'great', 'inside', 'joke', 'Blue', 'wizards', 'familiar', 'what', 'Tolkien', 'wrote', 'Sauron', 'presence', ""n't"", 'written', 'about', 'Hobbit', 'Jackson', 'decision', 'include', 'how', 'rise', 'here', 'sense.The', 'other', 'two', 'ways', 'create', 'more', 'problems', 'First', 'drastically', 'tale', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'composite', 'Azog', 'Bolg', 'Hobbit', 'making', 'main', 'antagonist', 'creating', 'numerous', 'plot', 'devices', 'Second', 'tangential', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'overall', 'Hobbit', 'direct', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'Bilbo', 'gaining', 'acceptance', 'distrustful', 'Thorin.Most', 'latter', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'come', 'battle', 'sequences', 'problem', 'Jackson', 'up', 'filling', 'much', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'point', 'where', 'repeated', 'CGI', 'sequences', 'end', 'up', 'almost', 'boring', 'merely', 'act', 'filler', 'rest', 'plot', 'not', 'advancing', 'doing', 'so', 'Jackson', 'have', 'missed', 'why', 'adapting', 'Battle', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'central', 'plot', 'element', 'Two', 'Towers', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Non-canon', 'characters', 'story', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'well', 'when', 'tie', 'together', 'loose', 'ends', 'advance', 'main', 'plot', 'When', 'battles', 'basically', 'become', 'main', 'plot', 'do', 'better', 'part', '2', 'hours', 'here', 'movie', 'would', 'suffer.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', 'advance', 'plot', 'one', 'gem', 'entire', 'movie', 'quality', 'original', 'trilogy', 'riddle', 'sequence', 'Gollum', 'Bilbo', 'where', 'Serkis', 'Freeman', 'nail', 'most', 'important', 'sequence', 'entire', 'prequel', 'rest', 'movie', 'lived', 'up', 'quality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic.Finally', 'as', 'far', '48', 'fps', 'debate', 'overblown', 'simple', 'way', 'think', 'watching', '120', 'Hz', '240', 'Hz', 'TV', 'upconverting', 'smoothness', 'video', 'quality', 'dramatically', 'much', 'watching', 'video', 'instead', 'TV', 'probably', 'worth', 'watching', '48', 'fps', 'novelty', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'that.Jackson', 'source', 'material', 'bit', 'more', 'robust', 'next', 'two', 'films', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'However', 'bottom', 'line', 'make', 'three', 'hour', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'need', 'three', 'hours', 'plot', 'material', 'next', 'time', '3', 'stars']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

This isn't an assignment, there was no need or requirement to make this 3 hours long, especially when there was no point to doing so. I think it was much better than the past Lord of the Ring movies, but at a certain point, you could tell that all the actors were exhausted and the movie began to lose focus. If I had one wish, it would be for the next movies to come in under 2 hours long. Almost 3 hours without a point is just pushing it. The LOTR movies suffer from the same problem as the Harry Potter films. There is absolutely no point to making them ridiculously long. The audience doesn't benefit, it is more work for the film makers, and theaters can't turn over showings as often. Furthermore, casual fans will simply not bother. A great movie with a great plot can be 3 hours long. This shouldn't be. It has no business being so. In the editing process, a director should see that a film is dragging and start cutting scenes. Peter Jackson is NOT a bad film maker. I've seen his other films, which were fantastic. I have no idea why with LOTR, he is fixated with lengthening the time out?Hopefully, this will change after the somewhat lackluster reviews of the last film, but it's doubtful.

1448987,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B0059XTU1S,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[42, 136]","Peter Jackson and the rest of the film crew have horribly adapted The Hobbit into a film. A correct adaptation of The Hobbit would produce one film that is slightly over 3 hours, or produce two films where each part is 2 hours. There is no need for a trilogy where each film nears 2 and half hours. But the Jackson team decided to make a trilogy comprised of a story that is severely stretched far beyond what it should be.Positives about the film are: the visuals, the acting, and the score. Each screenshot looks amazing and is filled to its entirety. Actors assume the roles fairly well, and some create a character that seems to have walked straight off the book's page. The score is wonderful and sets tones perfectly; the soundtrack is actually worth the buy. But none of these positives make up for how long and how slow this first film is.Film makers did a horrible job at creating a film that edits out the slow parts of the book, and The Hobbit has plenty of parts where it needs to be edited in order to keep the story from slowing down. The second half of the book has tons of chapters and parts of chapters that have way too much dialogue, scenes of walking, and scenes of sleeping that are not important to the overall story. That second half of The Hobbit requires film makers to know what to cut out in order to create a film (or two films) where the viewers are on a non-stop thrill ride.A proper film adaptation would have an opening shot of Bilbo lighting his pipe as he sits outside. By the first half hour of the film, Bilbo should be at the trolls. Slightly over an hour, Bilbo should be in the cave with Gollum. An hour later, Bilbo and the dwarves should be plotting how to escape from the elves. Half an hour later, they should be preparing to fight Smaug. Twenty minutes later, the film should be over. This product of a Hobbit film can be produced when film makers cut out all the dialogue, walking, and sleeping that is not important to the overall story.Sadly, Jackson and his team do not produce such a product. They put in extra dialogue and extra scenes that are not in the book. This causes the film to be very slow and filled with tons of scenes where characters are not doing anything important to the overall story. But if Jackson and his team wanted to create three films to profit from, they had to severely stretch The Hobbit far beyond what it should be.The worst scene to be adapted from the book is when Bilbo and Gollum battle each other. The book depicts this scene as scary because Gollum is so slimy, crazy, and willing to eat anything. There is no humor in the dialogue and the scene is scary because readers do not know what Gollum is capable of nor do readers know what Gollum is willing to do so he can kill Bilbo. The Jackson team does not portray the scariness of this scene at all, and they add in humorous dialogue that under-minds the scariness of Gollum.The film also falls short with certain computer animation. The trolls, the wolves, and Gollum, do not look real because they either look to shiny, too dull, or they lack 3 dimensional aspects. These faults of the computer animation make it very easy to spot the animation, and that causes the film to lose its impact of lifelikeness. One can only imagine how poor Smaug the dragon will look in the next film.Due to such a poor film adaptation of The Hobbit, Hollywood definitely needs to consider remaking this film and it definitely needs to reconsider the validity Peter Jackson has as a director. But it is clear such considerations will not be performed because those considerations should have been made as soon as Return of the King was released. After that film, it was clear Jackson was poor at adapting Tolkien stories and it was clear that another film maker should have been assigned to film The Hobbit.A smart film maker would know how much editing The Hobbit needs in order to create a non-stop thrill ride. Such a film maker would realize you do not put in extra scenes and dialogue, you cut out irrelevant parts to create an action adventure film. And Jackson's film adaptation fails in this regard. Anyone who reads The Hobbit will realize how horrible this film is, especially since it only takes 3 and a half hours (perhaps 4) to read the book.",1,Horrible Film Adaptation,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,4272,"['Peter', 'Jackson', 'rest', 'film', 'crew', 'have', 'horribly', 'adapted', 'Hobbit', 'film', 'correct', 'adaptation', 'Hobbit', 'would', 'produce', 'one', 'film', 'slightly', '3', 'hours', 'produce', 'two', 'films', 'where', 'part', '2', 'hours', 'need', 'trilogy', 'where', 'film', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'Jackson', 'team', 'decided', 'make', 'trilogy', 'comprised', 'story', 'severely', 'stretched', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'be.Positives', 'film', 'are', 'visuals', 'acting', 'score', 'screenshot', 'amazing', 'filled', 'entirety', 'Actors', 'assume', 'roles', 'fairly', 'well', 'create', 'character', 'have', 'walked', 'straight', 'book', 'page', 'score', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'tones', 'perfectly', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'worth', 'buy', 'none', 'positives', 'make', 'up', 'how', 'long', 'how', 'slow', 'first', 'film', 'is.Film', 'makers', 'did', 'horrible', 'job', 'creating', 'film', 'out', 'slow', 'parts', 'book', 'Hobbit', 'plenty', 'parts', 'where', 'be', 'edited', 'order', 'keep', 'story', 'slowing', 'down', 'second', 'half', 'book', 'tons', 'chapters', 'parts', 'chapters', 'have', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'walking', 'scenes', 'sleeping', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'overall', 'story', 'second', 'half', 'Hobbit', 'film', 'makers', 'know', 'what', 'cut', 'out', 'order', 'create', 'film', 'two', 'films', 'where', 'viewers', 'are', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'proper', 'film', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'opening', 'shot', 'Bilbo', 'lighting', 'pipe', 'outside', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'Bilbo', 'should', 'be', 'trolls', 'Slightly', 'hour', 'Bilbo', 'should', 'be', 'cave', 'Gollum', 'hour', 'later', 'Bilbo', 'dwarves', 'should', 'be', 'plotting', 'how', 'escape', 'elves', 'hour', 'later', 'should', 'be', 'preparing', 'fight', 'Smaug', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'later', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'over', 'product', 'Hobbit', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'produced', 'when', 'film', 'makers', 'cut', 'out', 'dialogue', 'walking', 'sleeping', 'not', 'important', 'overall', 'story.Sadly', 'Jackson', 'team', 'do', 'not', 'produce', 'such', 'product', 'put', 'extra', 'dialogue', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'book', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'slow', 'filled', 'tons', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'important', 'overall', 'story', 'Jackson', 'team', 'wanted', 'create', 'three', 'films', 'profit', 'had', 'severely', 'stretch', 'Hobbit', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'be.The', 'worst', 'scene', 'be', 'adapted', 'book', 'when', 'Bilbo', 'Gollum', 'battle', 'other', 'book', 'scene', 'scary', 'Gollum', 'so', 'slimy', 'crazy', 'willing', 'eat', 'anything', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'scary', 'readers', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'Gollum', 'capable', 'do', 'readers', 'know', 'what', 'Gollum', 'willing', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'kill', 'Bilbo', 'Jackson', 'team', 'not', 'portray', 'scariness', 'scene', 'add', 'humorous', 'dialogue', 'scariness', 'Gollum.The', 'film', 'also', 'short', 'certain', 'computer', 'animation', 'trolls', 'wolves', 'Gollum', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'real', 'look', 'shiny', 'too', 'dull', 'lack', '3', 'dimensional', 'aspects', 'faults', 'computer', 'animation', 'make', 'very', 'easy', 'spot', 'animation', 'film', 'lose', 'impact', 'lifelikeness', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'poor', 'Smaug', 'dragon', 'will', 'look', 'next', 'film.Due', 'poor', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Hobbit', 'Hollywood', 'definitely', 'consider', 'remaking', 'film', 'definitely', 'reconsider', 'validity', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'director', 'clear', 'such', 'considerations', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'performed', 'considerations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'as', 'soon', 'Return', 'King', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'was', 'clear', 'Jackson', 'was', 'poor', 'adapting', 'Tolkien', 'stories', 'was', 'clear', 'film', 'maker', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'film', 'Hobbit.A', 'smart', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'editing', 'Hobbit', 'needs', 'order', 'create', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'realize', 'do', 'not', 'put', 'extra', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'cut', 'out', 'irrelevant', 'parts', 'create', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'Jackson', 'film', 'adaptation', 'regard', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Hobbit', 'will', 'realize', 'how', 'horrible', 'film', 'especially', 'only', '3', 'half', 'hours', 'perhaps', '4', 'read', 'book']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

That's a movie for young teenagers. Action is primary and slightly primitive too. And what's more they cut up a one volume book into slices.Apart from that disappointment, we have to say it is well done and the special effects are perfect but they are nothing but special effects and they produce no sympathy, empathy or compassion. They just produce surprise and movement.So what about that Hobbit Bilbon Sacquet, one of these simple short men who live somewhere underground among the roots of some trees, who dedicate their lives to studying and accumulating knowledge about everything and the rest. Scholars, savants, scientists, how can he go on roads and run after adventure? Hobbits just can't, full stop, period, endgame and endpoint.So what about this particular Hobbit who is literally kidnapped by shame into joining an adventure in which he is not really wanted but just opportunistically needed. But his presence is resented by some of these dwarves he is supposed to travel with and help re-conquer their own kingdom out of which they have been ousted by a fiery dragon Smaug a long time ago and are since then chased by all kinds of monsters like trolls, goblins, orcs  or whatever these monstrous monsters are.The elves are beautiful and charming, grand and elegant, cultivated and prudent and yet they are not used to the utmost level they could have served. They are just nearly an obstacle on the road, along the way, that has to be pushed aside and then a beautiful butterfly will bring the big birds who will save the situation in its last dire strait but nothing is made as clear as it should be.

1449007,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B0059XTU1S,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[0, 0]","3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodAs a big fan of ""the Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which I consider the best trio of films ever made, I was ecstatic to hear about a prequel trilogy in ""the Hobbit"" & that Peter Jackson was helming them! I know many don't share that point of view on this new trio of films that have read the books, but as I have not read either ""the Lord of the Rings"" or ""the Hobbit,"" it pretty much goes without saying that I'm not here to compare the movies to books, but movies to movies. So with much relish, I went to ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" today, & to be honest, I was not overwhelmed, but I was not underwhelmed either.Yes, I went into this film reading several reviews about it, so I was not expecting the pure cinematic magic & genius of the prior films, & I didn't get that, but I got a film that may go on to classic status, but never masterpiece. Without giving a million things away about the film, I will say that there are several down falls here. For one, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" does not have the feeling of impending doom & desperation that the first three have. It veers to far towards a children's film the first half of the movie, with to much cuteness & comedy taking place, & not enough serious content. Though it starts out pretty good in setting the story up the first 15-20 minutes, one has to wonder how the dwarves ever made it to the status of overlords? Their pretty much portrayed as something more akin to ""Snow White & the Seven Dwarves,"" as all except a couple of the dwarves are inept in their intelligence, & seem to want to just eat, drink & be merry. Here I think Jackson made the same mistake as ""Star Wars"" episodes, ""Return of the Jedi"" (discounting the final show down between Luke, Darth Vader, & the Emperor), & ""the Phantom Menace."" Jackson dummied the movie down to appeal to a young audience, taking the chance of alienating the older adult audience. Also, another mistake made in this film is that Jackson threw everything he could possibly dream up in ""Middle Earth,"" & tossed it at you like a asteroid hurdling towards you through the movie screen at the speed of light. I mean, there was two, maybe three times the variety of creatures than previous films, & just to many characters to really be able to grasp & hold on to, & feel a real connection with. There was just to much shoved into a to small time frame of space, even if the film is almost three hours long. In this respect, ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" pales before the first three films, but then again, this is a very tall order, & Jackson is proved to be human after all.Even with all I said I didn't like about ""the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" there is more I liked. I really can't put a finger on it, but I feel this film will grow on me with repeated viewings. It has a great premise, & a director that is capable of taking it to greater heights with the two following films, if he fixes the mistakes made here. I do have to say the 3-D was amazing, & really made ""Middle Earth"" come to life, though in the fast moving sequences, there was some blur with the background. This will most likely be fixed & improved on. It also does not hurt that many characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" have returned with the same actors. I look forward to their roles & the part they'll play in the future films!All in all, this is a film that may reach classic status with me in time. It was a huge undertaking, & had almost the impossible task to live up to ""Lord of the Rings."" For the time being, I'll rate this a very good film, that you should see for yourself & make your own opinion.

1449008,AQ01Q3070LT29,B0059XTU1S,James McDonald,"[1, 2]","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012). Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: 2 hours, 49 mins.  This review is for the single disc.This is the very first story that takes place before The Lord of The Rings movie trilogy by Peter Jackson.In this movie series, we first met the older Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) before Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam began their journey in The Lord of The Rings.The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions)  [Blu-ray].But on this day, Bilbo decides it is time to write his story, to his nephew Frodo, of his adventure in discovering and obtaining the powerful Ring first. Their is more to the story he has never told, such as, the discovery of the Arkenstone and the first attack of the dragon from the north. The dragon's name is Smaug. He attacked the town of Dale and scared away the Dwarves out of their place to live on Lonely Mountain.Bilbo (Martin Freeman) lives in the Shire. He is 50, but looks younger. He has a nice house in the hill where the home inside feels warm and round archways compliment the entrance to a room. Bilbo meets the wizard, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) who secretly etches a glowing symbol on Bilbo's front door. Later that night, a dwarve visits his door. It is Dwalin (Graham McTavish). Bilbo wasn't interested in accepting any company tonight, but Dwalin makes himself at home and wants to eat food. He eats almost whatever food he sees Bilbo has. Bilbo tries to hide some bread for himself. Then a second visitor arrives. It is Dwalin's brother, Balin (Ken Stott).Soon Bilbo's house is filled with 12 dwarves including, Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Kili (Aidan Turner), Dori (Mark Hadlow), Nori (Jed Brophy), Ori (Adam Brown), Oin (John Callen), Gloin (Peter Hambleton), Bifur (William Kircher), Bofur (James Nesbitt) and Bombur (Stephen Hunter).Bilbo has had enough of this. They all eat a feast and eat everything Bilbo has. The cherished family dishes are being thrown and played with. The place is a mess. But since the arrival of Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo knows he has been tricked.  Gandalf knows Bilbo is the chosen one and they ask him to sign a contract to help them on their mission to reclaim Lonely Mountain. Bilbo wants no part of it. He wants to stay in Bag End.When Bilbo awakens and finds his house is back to being clean and his dishes are clean and back in their proper place, he changes his mind and catches up with the company to be part of the quest. Gandalf had no doubt, or did he? It won't be easy for our new friends.Also in the cast: Elijah Wood, Sylvester McCoy, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, Andy Serkis, Lee Pace, Benedict Cumberbatch.Option of Language & Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.Special Feature: New Zealand's Home of Middle-Earth.With Gandalf telling the story of Bilbo Baggin's great-great-great-great uncle, Bullroarer Took and the Battle of Green Fields venging the Goblin King, I wonder if Peter Jackson will make a new trilogy of this in the near future? Surely, there are more stories to tell.The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are based upon the novels of J.R.R.

The Hobbit was the original story by Tolkien for his grandchildren. It retains some the the bedtime story elements in this movie. It is much less serious as LoTR, but even more serious in the strong emotional tie to your home. The dragon, sadly, is the last one in Middle Earth, and the tale about reclaiming the dwarves home is a mountain of gold.

Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.

At the moment, though, I think it neatly breaks down into pluses and minuses for me, and rather than enumerate all of them, I'll just go straight to my main complaint with this film and, indeed, with all of Jackson's forays into J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth so far.Even taking into account that movie adaptations always take some liberties with the stories they adapt from the original print sources, why does Jackson continually feel the need to add in elements that not only weren't in the original but add nothing to the retelling? Does the viewer really need to know more about Radegast the Brown apart from his name, which is all he is in Tolkien's original book? Do we have to have Jackson's clownish envisioning of that character, based on nothing but a few references to him in Tolkien's writings and ending up in the movie being more Disney than Tolkien? Why do the references from the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy crop up throughout? Did Jackson have no faith that the original source of THE HOBBIT, namely Tolkien's book and written well before the trilogy, would've had sufficient backbone to tell what really is a cracker of a tale without help?In the end, the movie comes off all right because the actors, the scenery and----to a limited extent----the script all work to create a world that works in the movie to tell JACKSON'S version of the tale. And if audiences enjoy that kind of compromise, fine. To me, though, it comes across as more of a ""fanboy"" movie, one made by someone who couldn't wait to ""fix the mistakes"" Tolkien supposedly made. I think I probably enjoy the movie best on that level, but I hope someday someone will try their hand at it again and trust Tolkien's original vision just a little more while they retell it.

By the end of the movie, I still knew the names of only 4 of the dwarves--a bit more time spent on the characters would have been appreciated rather than the goblin scene and the later orc scene going on a bit too long.  I loved the riddle scene between Bilbo & Gollum and found the movie entertaining, but I missed having subtitles on the digital rental--I probably missed the dialogue in 1/3 of the movie, including some of the riddles. :-(Loved Radagast the Brown, loved the elves, loved seeing Frodo......but I wish they had used available technology to de-age all of the characters we've seen before--it's possible (the Tron sequel, even NCIS has used it successfully), and with the budget these movies have?  There was no need for Frodo, older Bilbo, and Galadriel to look so different.  Even Bilbo's hair was different.  Only Hugo Weaving looked nearly the same.  (With Frodo, it wasn't only the face--although they did get the wig right!--it was the fact that the actor went from being a very young man to a man in his prime in the interim 10 years--the shoulders/carriage were completely different.)  These are nitpicky things--but Peter Jackson has showed himself to be a director who pays incredible attention to detail generally.In many ways, Jackson has taken a book I always found the least interesting of the Middle Earth volumes, and turned it into a delightful, fun story that comes alive.  But I really was getting restless and ready to move on by the end of the two main battle scenes.

Tolkien's Middle Earth Books _The Hobbit_ into three movies when he was able to cover the entire _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy in the same number of films.  It should be obvious that the short novel is going to endure some padding if Jackson wants to stretch it across three movies entitled THE HOBBIT, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG and THERE AND BACK AGAIN.  How you feel about Jackson's depiction of Middle Earth will determine how much you like this movie.I have seen some critics complain that this movie drags.  I myself was delighted to see the characters never seen in the _The Hobbit_ but only referred to in the book.  (Possible Spoilers Ahead!). I rejoiced to see old friends at Rivendale like Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchette as Galadrial, and Christopher Lee as the future traitor Saruman the White.Radaghast the Brown's debut presentation was curious but it was satisfying to see the Necromancer and the Witch King of Angmar at Don Gul Dur in a scene only hinted at in the novel.I believe that described it in a nutshell.  If you enjoy seeing scenes of the  fantastic come to life you will enjoy this padding and gobble it up like cotton candy and look forward to the next helping.  If all you care about is action and a race to the conclusion this movie might weigh on you like a plate of greasy corndogs and seem to drag.You can see from my five star review which camp I fall into.

Of course I purchase the first edition of theDVD of this film from AMAZON and since ordered the 3D versions in Blue ray as well as conventional DVDs.  I have only watched the theatrical version onthe standard DVD and am impressed with the near HD quality of the images.  I do not however like the idea of the film being in three parts since thebook is fairly short and easy to read. And Tolkien himself was not happy with the story after he finished: he wished he had made it more for adults.Well, the film accomplished that alright and beautifully well.  Still, two films could have covered the book easily. Peter Jackson, a fine director,likes to expand original stories as he did with the LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG.  He almost ruined KK with a silly ending, but it was OK.Here he remains pretty faithful to the book with added violence though I guess that is what people want today.  Still, I loved it with an excellentcast and I understand some returnies in  the next edition.  Splendid special effects, especially in the underground caves..kinda creepy.  I have yetto visit the extras on the discs though I love motion picture production stuff: a field I wish I had gotten into.  If you don't know the story but liked the theatrical film, you will love this DVD.  Wait until you see the next films; there is a great dialog scene between Bilbo the Burglar andSmaug the dragon.

I really didn't know what to expect after the Lord Of The Rings but we got the DVD and sat down to watch the film. It was wonderful! It was a good story with the revisit to Middle Earth and Bilbo Baggins journey through the perils of the land to help the trolls reclaim their kingdom and their treasure.Bilbo was a reluctant traveler but he felt obligated to go at their request and that of the Wizard Gandalf. He was not a warrior nor and adventuresome sort of Hobbit because he had become a homebody and he was more comfortable by the hearth and enjoying a warm meal than risking his life on an adventure. The film features much of the original cast of characters and the original actors and so the screenplay, acting and storyline are wonderfully done. The cinematography is just spectacular as well as the special effects in the film. It was nice to see the entire gambit of the Middle Earth's creatures, races and famous characters like:* Gandolf the Grey Wizard* Trolls* Dwarfs* Hobbits* Orcs* Giant spiders* Smaug the Dragon* A necromancer* Warg scouts* Elves* Goblins* Radagast the Brown Wizard* Saruman the White Wizard* Witches - present but not seen* Stone giants* Giant eaglesI loved the story, the panoramic scenery and the action and adventure.

I'm not going to give any spoilers or specific examples* of where I felt it fell short, but I mourn for some of the charm of the book which just didn't come across in the film. I'm not a purist - I realize changes have to be made to tell a story - that's not what I have a problem with. As long as the changes are sensible and add something to the story, as long as key features of the original work are not lost in the transition, then I would have no complaints.Having said that, The Hobbit is still a fun ride. I will re-watch the film many times, I'm sure, and would be interested in a version with extended scenes. I still love the world-building of Middle Earth, and, having read the book, my mind is sort of filling the gaps the movie missed, and sort of editing out what I don't agree with. I'll purchase the 2nd and 3rd parts of this trilogy, I'm sure, and who knows - maybe they'll be better than this first part.*(ok - one small, semi-specific complaint which really irks me: how did they manage to not suffer tremendous injuries after all they went through? if you've seen the film, you'll know what i'm talking about. just pushed the limits of credibility a bit too far for me. with the wonders of CGI, it seems too often the temptation is to put in sequences that would be impossible to survive without getting hurt.)",4,Mixed Feelings,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,1659,"['have', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'are', 'certain', 'areas', 'feel', 'were', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'tad', 'disappointing.There', 'was', 'question', 'was', 'going', 'purchase', 'film', 'impressive', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'knowing', 'are', 'masterful', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'Hobbit', 'Trilogy', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'spoilers', 'specific', 'examples*', 'where', 'felt', 'fell', 'short', 'mourn', 'charm', 'book', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'purist', 'realize', 'changes', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'problem', 'As', 'long', 'changes', 'are', 'sensible', 'add', 'something', 'story', 'as', 'long', 'key', 'features', 'original', 'work', 'are', 'not', 'lost', 'transition', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'complaints.Having', 'said', 'Hobbit', 'still', 'fun', 'ride', 'will', 're-watch', 'film', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'version', 'extended', 'scenes', 'still', 'love', 'world-building', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'mind', 'sort', 'filling', 'gaps', 'movie', 'missed', 'sort', 'editing', 'out', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', ""'ll"", 'purchase', '2nd', '3rd', 'parts', 'trilogy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'first', 'part', '*', 'ok', 'one', 'small', 'semi-specific', 'complaint', 'really', 'how', 'did', 'manage', 'not', 'suffer', 'tremendous', 'injuries', 'went', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'talking', 'just', 'pushed', 'limits', 'credibility', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'wonders', 'CGI', 'too', 'often', 'temptation', 'put', 'sequences', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'survive', 'getting', 'hurt']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Given this and 'King Kong' PJ seems to have come away from 'LOTR' with the firm conviction that nothing succeeds like excess. More length, more action, more orcs, more hairbreadth (and, to be honest, harebrained) escapes. He really has tried to turn the Don's sweet sad little book into an epic to match 'LOTR'. But this time a lot of his additions and changes (except for bringing in the Necromancer and the prologue to the War of the Ring) don't really work. They look more like padding. I reeeally got tired of hordes of orcs showing up everywhere for more mind-numbing ear-busting CGI action, and the obligatory Miracle Rescue by the Eagles. Being a bit of a Ringer myself, I'm still irritated at PJ's separating orcs from goblins, when all the goblins were, were early versions of orcs, before Tolkein renamed them. Kept seeing bits of 'Fellowship' and 'Return' here, thinly re-imagined, especially in the goblin's caverns, and double-especially when they go riding on collapsing bridges just like the stairs in Moria with zillions of goblins nipping at their heels. AGAIN. I can see why del Toro opted out. In the late 60's Rankin-Bass did an animated 'Hobbit' that I much prefer. It starred Orson Bean as Bilbo, John Huston as Gandalf, Richard Boone as a truly nasty Smaug, and some creep named Brother Theodore as Gollum, who, unlike Andy Serkis, remembered how Gollum got his name, and it wasn't from an asthmatic cough.

The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum is some of the most riveting screen time ever. Serkis SO deserves a Major Award (not a leg lamp) for his tormented, schizophrenic Gollum.

So yes, I love the book.  For anyone with a similar background, I can confidently say you're best served not watching the film.  Simple as that, read no further....that said, I probably differ from a lot of the people who loved the book in that I didn't expect a perfect word for word re-enactment of the book.  I figured it would be have to be different from a logistical standpoint - how do you cram a whole book, or even a third of a book, into a relatively short time for the sake of the movie?I found myself, not offended by this movie as a lover of the book, but just laughing a lot.  I estimate at least 50% of the events in the film don't happen in the book.  Another 40% is composed of CGI action extrapolated off events that kinda sorta did happen in the book but not really.  The remaining 10% was kind of pleasant I guess.  They got the appearance of some things right.  A few times, they had characters say some of the actual lines from the book, although much less frequently than you'd think.But it was VERY strange - practically every major event in the book is altered away from what it was and a lot of little things got altered - during the cleaning of the dishes, they omitted ""...so carefully carefully with the plates"" in favor of repeating an earlier part of the song - they didn't save any time with the omission and lost some of the meaning of what was going on. ...or when they finally got around to the opening couple sentences from the book, they changed them.  ""... it was a hobbit hole and that means comfort ...able THINGS""?  And for instance, they made the dwarves oafish, rude, and kind of dumb instead of the exceedingly polite educated highborn fellows they were - which made it more difficult to understand why Bilbo had a hard time turning them away.  So instead of getting to know the dwarves a little bit and perhaps liking them, sympathizing with them, they remain relatively generic and un-likeable, which is why later they have to develop the new subplot of Bilbo's pity for them ""Oh I have a home and you don't"" in place of what worked in the book.  Because otherwise Bilbo's actions don't make sense at all.  The additions, rather than streamlining the book into a film, created more work the authors had to backtrack later to try and repair.  Does Bilbo's sympathy for the dwarves in the last 20 minutes of the film make up for them being made into such unsympathetic characters at the beginning?  The writers end up creating problems that take even longer to solve than it would have to just do the original thing.  This really is a case of short cuts make for long delays.And of course there's all the extra mind numbing action with all the action cliches - people yelling ""nooooooo!"" in slow-mo happens over and over.  So much $#!% happens so quickly in such an undulating CGI consequence-free unreality, that it takes you out of the story and straight out of the movie....so you end up with this film that is bloated with alterations, additions, and CGI action.  You'd figure the additions, at least the action, was there to keep it exciting, but the overall effect is  surprisingly BORING.I'd heard there was a lot of ""extra stuff"" in the movie and was prepared to give it a chance but wow, just wow.  My point isn't so much ""Hey they diverged from the book,"" but my god, they went to a LOT of trouble to diverge from the book with a bunch of 3rd rate material when using the original stuff would have been EASIER, then dragged in unnecessary stuff from the LOTR to do a number on that too, then added a whole bunch of extra new stuff that was even worse.  It's amazing that, in deciding to alter so much for the sake of making it into a movie, we end up with a 3 hour movie where the majority of the movie wasn't part of the book OR the appendices.It's as if they wanted to make, idunno, Krull With Rabbit Sleighs but get everyone to buy it by referencing The Hobbit - only to blunder every reference and fail with their new material.I honestly don't feel that my childhood story was ruined any way - this is so far from the original, I don't recognize it - just embarrassed for the makers of this film.  Standing on its own as a film unconnected with any book, it's a confused, boring, cliched mess.  Guillermo Del Toro I'm embarrassed for more than anyone, although he showed the good sense to leave the project, so maybe, hopefully, he's the least to blame.  He's never produced a lame, boring, cliche-ridden turkey like this before so I'll give him a pass - we'll see in July with Pacific Rim if he's still got the magic or not.So if you're looking for a fantasy movie, skip this and do, idunno, Krull, Ladyhawke, Legend, Stardust, Princess Bride, Willow, Any of the Harry Potters, the Narias weren't TOO bad I hear, Time Bandits... I guess you could throw in Highlander if you like.  If you want to go the sword and sorcery route and don't mind on-purpose campiness, there's beastmaster and the various conan movies.",1,wow,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,5128,"['Now', ""'ll"", 'admit',

It didn't even fall into the ""fun"" films category like Beetlejuice, Rango or Depp's Alice in Wonderland. The frenzied pace of non-stop action begins within the first few minutes when the dwarves show up for dinner and continues without respite for the remainder of the film until the credits roll. The overwhelming bulk of this is back-to-back chase and battle scenes weilding axes, arrows and swords. It's the cinema version of the World of Warcraft MMPOG - emphasis on ""massive."" The utterly unnecessarily complex screenplay is grossly bloated to create the first in a planned trilogy of full length feature films from a single, medium length novel. The novel's major underlying ""Bildungsroman"" themes - Bilbo Baggins' evolution - achieving worldly maturity through overcoming the trials of his journey - with his growth in understanding and grappling with the struggle between egocentrism and greed versus altruism - are completely lost - reducing it to nothing more than a fantasy action film on amphetamines.LOTR needed to be a trilogy to adequately cover Tolkein's 3 novels. The Hobbit novel could have - and should have - been adapted as one (likely long) feature film.

Nothing against Guillermo Del Toro's work; on the contrary, it would have been rather interesting to see his take on Tolkien's world.

Similarly I enjoyed the Rivendell scenes (though where Jackson got the idea that Elves are vegetarians is beyond my comprehension.) Overall, where the film sticks closest to Tolkien's own story it is most successful.Unfortunately Jackson repeats the errors he made in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by focussing on long, violent stretches of battle and conflict. Much of the magic of Tolkien disappears in the sword play.  While I recognize that this was undoubtedly a good box office move, nevertheless I would have enjoyed more poetry and less bloodshed.

1449112,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B0059XTU1S,John Kwok,"[6, 10]","Fans of Tolkien and fantasy films rejoice! Director Peter Jackson has conjured the impossible again, in this long-awaited return to Middle Earth, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", that serves as a most compelling prequel to ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and as a spectacular start to his ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. Purists may decry the fact that Jackson has added some characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, but they will have forgotten that virtually all of them are accounted for in Tolkien's appendices to ""The Lord of the Rings"" and in the ""Unfinished Tales"". Whatever liberties taken by Jackson and his screenwriting collaborators - including his ""The Lord of the Rings"" collaborators Philippa Boyen and Fran Walsh, and Guillermo del Toro (who was designated originally as the director of two ""The Hobbit"" films) - remain consistent with Tolkien's spirit and vision of Middle-Earth, especially with its prior history before the events chronicled in ""The Hobbit"", and then, sixty years later, ""The Lord of The Rings"". Once more we are treated to epic filmmaking of a grand scale, with New Zealand standing in for Middle Earth; those who are especially familiar with the first movie, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", will recognize  much of the Middle Earth countryside, from The Shire to Rivendell and beyond.  But the scenery is merely the stage for the events which unfold, for which Jackson has assembled again a most impressive cast of actors to tell a gripping saga of truly monumental proportions; ample praise should be bestowed on Richard Armitage for his heroic portrayal as the dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, leading his small band of dwarves on an all but hopeless quest fraught with ample danger, and Martin Freeman as the younger, more vigorous, Bilbo Baggins, portrayed by Ian Holm in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Fans of ""Doctor Who"" will barely recognize Sylvester McCoy, hidden in his nature-tinged makeup as the wizard Radagast, but his fine performance as the Middle Earth wizard will remind some of his decades-old portrayal of the Doctor.  Of the other returning cast members from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, Cate Blanchett (""Galadriel""), Hugo Weaving (""Elrond""), Christopher Lee (""Saruman"") and Andy Serkus (""Gollum""), are splendid in their all too brief screen appearances; so too are two others whom I won't mention, simply to prevent myself from divulging any  further spoilers.There are intense scenes of physical and psychological combat throughout much of the film; the war of words that persist, with signs of mistrust between dwarves and elves, between a dwarf and a hobbit,  are almost as riveting as the sword-fighting between dwarves and orcs, or in a spectacular battle deep within the bowels of one mountain, as the dwarves flee the Great Goblin (portrayed by Barry ""Dame Edna"" Humphries) and his army. Much of the film's cinematic pacing will remind fans of Jacksons' ""The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King"", especially in its battles, which  are fast-forward climatic and intense, despite a rather sluggish first half hour or so, accompanied by the familiar sounds of the London Philharmonic Orchestra playing Howard Shore's almost Wagnerian film score, which is compelling to listen in its own right, even with frequent borrowing of musical leitmotifs from ""The Ring"" films. Jackson, his cast and technical crew, held me spellbound for hours, with barely a dull moment or two, save for the film's first half hour.  Don't believe any negative reviews written by professional film critics and others. If ""The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey"" can be seen by most as a compellingly first-rate example of cinematic storytelling at its best, then I have high hopes that the other two films in ""The Hobbit"" trilogy will be compared favorably with ""The Lord of the Ring"" trilogy; a feat that no visionary Hollywood director or producer has ever accomplished, especially George Lucas in his ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy. Welcome back, Peter Jackson, and thank you for leading us on yet another spectacular cinematic adventure through Middle Earth. Long-time Tolkien fans will truly feel like they have left home and come back again; I, for one, know that I will take ""An Unexpected Journey"" again soon at my nearest movie theater.",5,A Most Welcomed Return to Middle Earth,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,4302,"['Fans', 'Tolkien', 'fantasy', 'films', 'rejoice', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'conjured', 'impossible', 'again', 'long-awaited', 'return', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'most', 'compelling', 'prequel', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'spectacular', 'start', 'Hobbit', 'trilogy', 'Purists', 'may', 'decry', 'fact', 'Jackson', 'added', 'characters', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'will', 'have', 'forgotten', 'virtually', 'are', 'accounted', 'Tolkien', 'appendices', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Unfinished', 'Tales', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Jackson', 'screenwriting', 'collaborators', 'including', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'collaborators', 'Philippa', 'Boyen', 'Fran', 'Walsh', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'who', 'was', 'designated', 'originally', 'director', 'two', 'Hobbit', 'films', 'remain', 'consistent', 'Tolkien', 'spirit', 'vision', 'Middle-Earth', 'especially', 'prior', 'history', 'events', 'chronicled', 'Hobbit', 'then', 'sixty', 'years', 'later', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Once', 'more', 'are', 'treated', 'epic', 'filmmaking', 'grand', 'scale', 'New', 'Zealand', 'standing', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'who', 'are', 'especially', 'familiar', 'first', 'movie', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'will', 'recognize', 'much', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'countryside', 'Shire', 'Rivendell', 'scenery', 'merely', 'stage', 'events', 'unfold', 'Jackson', 'assembled', 'again', 'most', 'impressive', 'cast', 'actors', 'tell', 'gripping', 'saga', 'truly', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'ample', 'praise', 'should', 'be', 'bestowed', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'heroic', 'portrayal', 'dwarf', 'king', 'Thorin', 'Oakenshield', 'leading', 'small', 'band', 'dwarves', 'hopeless', 'quest', 'fraught', 'ample', 'danger', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'younger', 'more', 'vigorous', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'portrayed', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'Fans', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'will', 'barely', 'recognize', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'hidden', 'nature-tinged', 'makeup', 'wizard', 'Radagast', 'fine', 'performance', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'will', 'remind', 'decades-old', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'other', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Galadriel', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Elrond', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Saruman', 'Andy', 'Serkus', 'Gollum', 'are', 'splendid', 'too', 'brief', 'screen', 'appearances', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'two', 'others', 'whom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'simply', 'prevent', 'divulging', 'further', 'spoilers.There', 'are', 'intense', 'scenes', 'physical', 'psychological', 'combat', 'much', 'film', 'war', 'words', 'persist', 'signs', 'mistrust', 'dwarves', 'elves', 'dwarf', 'hobbit', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'riveting', 'sword-fighting', 'dwarves', 'orcs', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'deep', 'bowels', 'one', 'mountain', 'dwarves', 'flee', 'Great', 'Goblin', 'portrayed', 'Barry', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'Humphries', 'army', 'Much', 'film', 'cinematic', 'pacing', 'will', 'remind', 'fans', 'Jacksons', 'Lord', 'Ring', 'Return', 'King', 'especially', 'battles', 'are', 'fast-forward', 'climatic', 'intense', 'rather', 'sluggish', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'accompanied', 'familiar', 'sounds', 'London', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra', 'playing', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'almost', 'Wagnerian', 'film', 'score', 'compelling', 'listen', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'frequent', 'borrowing', 'musical', 'leitmotifs', 'Ring', 'films', 'Jackson', 'cast', 'technical', 'crew', 'held', 'spellbound', 'hours', 'barely', 'dull', 'moment', 'two', 'save', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'negative', 'reviews', 'written', 'professional', 'film', 'critics', 'others', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'most', 'compellingly', 'first-rate', 'example', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'best', 'then', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'Hobbit', 'trilogy', 'will', 'be', 'compared', 'favorably', 'Lord', 'Ring', 'trilogy', 'feat', 'visionary', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'producer', 'ever', 'accomplished', 'especially', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequel', 'trilogy', 'Welcome', 'back', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'thank', 'leading', 'yet', 'spectacular', 'cinematic', 'adventure', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Long-time', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'will', 'truly', 'feel', 'have', 'left', 'home', 'come', 'back', 'again', 'one', 'know', 'will', 'take', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'again', 'soon', 'nearest', 'movie', 'theater']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449115,A126JVOAOOR42V,B0059XTU1S,John McConnell,"[20, 27]","Well, not entirely unexpected...Travesty - a false, absurd, or distorted representation of something.Director Sir Peter Jackson's prior reworking of a few elements of The Lord of the Rings, reworkings that telegraphically but tellingly indicated Jackson's profound miscomprehension of the material he was dealing with, were clues that Jackson's bona fides as nuncio of JRR Tolkien's mythic vision were very, very, very tenuous - at best. While I enjoyed the LotR films, I don't consider them classics so much as more or less providentially lucky strikes.But here, we enter a new world - a world in which Jackson compels his actors and actresses and special effects gurus and everyone connected with this film to become his unwitting instruments for leaving his metaphorical spray all over Tolkien's pristine Middle Earth. Jackson in effect takes a work of Shakespeare and turns it into Pee-wee's Big Adventure, takes a work on the sublime level of Mark Twain and ""translates"" it down to the crass level of Adam Sandler. If you relish that sort of thing, the caricaturing and travesty of something resplendently beautiful into something frenetically tacky, or are willing to look past it, you may enjoy this film.Jackson is acknowledged as a serious artist and talented director, who began his career directing dark comedy, slapstick horror, twisted spoofs, and macabre tales such as the films Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, Braindead, and Heavenly Creatures. Directing travesties, in other words, of healthy normal characters and situations. One amazon reviewer (Mark Pollock) describes Meet the Feebles thus: ""If you enjoy watching puppets curse, vomit, defecate, urinate, fornicate, come down with venereal disease, do drug deals, do drugs, and shoot each other up with machine guns, then this film is right up your alley. It is NOT a children's film, that's for sure."" Jackson's directorial career has been accoladed with three academy awards, and even a knighthood from his homeland of New Zealand. But a simple understanding of and ability to convey virtue have *never*, EVER, been strengths of Jackson's resume.Have I been wordy? In fine, this film is the apotheosis of shlock.Jackson's ""Meet the Hobbits"" has moral decadence written all over it, a mishandling of pure things by Jackson's impure hands. As Joseph Pearce, author ofBilbo's Journey: Discovering the Hidden Meaning in  The Hobbit, puts it, ""Peter Jackson does not understand virtue"". The film makes one reflect not so much upon the mystery of Middle Earth as upon the mystery of Peter Jackson. The film explores this mystery extensively. If you are someone fascinated by Peter Jackson, this film is perhaps the perfect vehicle. You will learn a lot. Certainly much more than you will learn about JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit. Jackson's conceptual designer for this film has remarked that, for Jackson, ""the film is almost incidental really"". Incidental to what, seems a valid question. Incidental to Peter Jackson's self-expression, seems a valid answer. As another amazon reviewer (Knight Rain) puts it: ""The book is filled with mystery and charm. The movie is a neurological attack on the mind."" Then there is Christopher Tolkien, JRR Tolkien's son, who comments thus on Peter Jackson's work: ""They [Sir Peter Jackson and Co.] gutted the book, making an action movie for 15-25 year olds.... This level of marketing reduces to nothing the aesthetic and philosophical significance of this work. And it seems that The Hobbit will be the same kind of film.""And there's the rub: For there are those among us who consider JRR Tolkien's book The Hobbit a very fine work of art indeed. We feel stories such as The Hobbit are rare. Very rare. And we consider that if handled they should be handled with care - because there are very few beautiful things in this world. Tolkien stated, ""The Lord of the Rings is a fundamentally religious and Catholic work"". It follows much the same is true of The Hobbit. You may say, ""So what?"" I will reply, the essence of Tolkien's Middle Earth IS virtue. Not travesty. Soul, not soullessness. Tolkien's world is full of tales of heroism and beauty. It is a world of oral tradition, and loveliness, and mysterious grace. For example, Tolkien's comment in chapter five of The Hobbit (Riddles in the Dark), that ""[of course] the riddle game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played it"". Find that spirit in this film. You cannot. Which is why I propose you cannot find Tolkien in this film.

1449117,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B0059XTU1S,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers.***I know this sounds weird, but have you ever refused to watch a movie because you haven&#8217;t read the book or play that inspired it, and therefore don&#8217;t feel &#8220;ready&#8221; to see it?  For example, that&#8217;s why (with the exception of &#8220;The Sorceror&#8217;s Stone&#8221;) I never saw the Harry Potter octology (eight films) based on J.K. Rowling&#8217;s seven novels.  How could my movie impressions compare with those who have immersed themselves in both the Harry Potter book AND movie mythos?  Ditto with J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s &#8220;Lord of the Rings (LotR)&#8221; novel trilogy and Peter Jackson&#8217;s movie trilogy based on it: I haven&#8217;t done the LotR &#8220;reading homework&#8221; (yet, but I&#8217;d like to someday), so how can I presume to watch and fully appreciate and understand the LotR movies? I wasn&#8217;t worthy, I wasn&#8217;t worthy.Then Peter Jackson announced many moons ago that he planned a movie adaptation of Tolkien&#8217;s unofficial LotR prequel, the beloved, durable classic &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;, and I subsequently became excited.  I HAD read &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221; and even critiqued it on Amazon.com, and so felt prepared to watch &#8220;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#8221; (hereafter &#8220;Hobbit: AUJ&#8221;) and even compare and contrast it with the novel, and discuss it with its numerous fans.  Then, I found out &#8220;Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; would incorporate origins of events (such as the White Council and the rise of the Necromancer) only barely alluded to in &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221; novel but more fully fleshed out in the &#8220;LotR&#8221; movie trilogy.  Furthermore, Jackson planned an epic 9-hour movie trilogy. My enthusiasm wavered.  I was starting to doubt I was prepared to watch THIS trilogy either, because I thought it would be altered, attenuated, and mixed up beyond recognition. Therefore, I missed &#8220;Hobbit:AUJ&#8221; in the theatres.Recently, however, &#8220;Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; popped up on HBO, and I finally resolved to devote the time to seeing it. So, especially to those people who have read only &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;, and even those who have read the unannotated, un-appendixed version, I can state with relief and happy surprise that &#8220;Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; remains largely and divertingly faithful to the roughly first 50% of the novel it covers.  It covers the various set-pieces (e.g. Gandalf&#8217;s (Sir Ian McKellen) recruitment of the reluctant Bilbo for a territory-reclaiming and burgling adventure, the dwarves&#8217; boisterous visit to Bilbo&#8217;s hobbit-hole, the encounter with the dull-witted trolls) with vigor, boisterous humor, and exquisitely rendered CGI action.  Even the preliminary explanation for the dwarves&#8217; exile from their Erebor home by the barely glimpsed but still astounding dragon Smaug (though not explicitly in the novel) efficiently and rousingly sets up the hobbit&#8217;s adventure.  Yes, there are the lengthy LotR detours such as the wild-eyed, slovenly wood wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) only mentioned once by Beorn in the unannotated Hobbit) discovering the spiders and other evil forces of the Necromancer massing and the White Council including Gandalf, Elrond the Elvenking (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) contemplating the Necromancers rise.  However, I did not find them all that distracting, and perhaps even a little bit useful if I ever tackle both book and movie &#8220;LotR&#8221;.In general, no movie can be slavishly faithful to its literary source since they are two distinct mediums with distinct advantages and disadvantages.  &#8220;The Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; is certainly no exception.  A movie CAN take dramatic license with a book&#8217;s plot and characters provided it doesn&#8217;t deviate too much from its spirit.  I think &#8220;The Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; largely succeeds in doing this.  I felt one of the main themes of &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221; novel is that no matter how small, timid, and uncertain you are, you can have the traits and courage to accomplish great things. In &#8220;The Hobbit: AUJ&#8221;, the younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) expresses that theme very well, and even improves upon it.In the novel, many people might feel that Bilbo was too much of a reluctant hero, too whiny and complaining.  Remember in the novel when he practically curled into a quivering fetal position when Gandalf and the dwarves explain the danger of their quest?  In the movie, Bilbo merely comically faints.  Furthermore, in the movie Freeman&#8217;s Bilbo is more refreshingly and amusingly persnickety, fussy, and indignant than in the novel and shows his slowly receding unwillingness to go on the journey more admirably.  Still, some &#8220;Hobbit&#8217; novel purists may balk at Bilbo&#8217;s &#8220;uncharacteristic&#8221; slaying of a charging orc (also not in the novel) to save Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage).  It didn&#8217;t bother me, because I saw it as the first, spontaneous manifestation of Bilbo&#8217;s growing Tookish resolve.  An even better and touching illustration of Bilbo&#8217;s resolve comes toward the end of the movie, after the eagles have rescued Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves from being besieged in fir trees by the hideous, slavering orcs and their wolf-mounts, the Wargs.  Bilbo, a complacent bourgeois home-owner, pities the dwarves&#8217; nomadic homelessness and vows to help them reclaim their mountain home from the dragon Smaug.So in conclusion, if, like me, you have read an unadorned copy of &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;, you needn&#8217;t fear that &#8220;The Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; has mangled and twisted the tale into an unknown shape.  It hasn&#8217;t, and unless you are fastidious and nitpicky, you may enjoy some of Jackson&#8217;s flourishes (such as the grotesque but eloquent Goblin King&#8217;s (Barry Humphries&#8217;s) &#8220;fat&#8221; beard and his teeming underground kingdom) and still rest assured that &#8220;The Hobbit: AUJ&#8221; has mostly respected Tolkien&#8217;s tale &#8211; at least so far.Anyway, I now feel worthy and ready to see &#8220;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&#8221; in the theatre.  If nothing else, I think I will enjoy seeing Smaug the Tremendous, the Magnificent, and the Stupendous!",4,"Except for two or three &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; Detours, &#8220;The Hobbit: An

That said, The Hobbit movie is an utterly predictable rehashing of LOTR's most notable moments, as if Peter Jackson had simply run out of ideas and re-filmed his favorite LOTR moments: Over-long chase scenes with things crashing? Check. Gandalf showing up in the nick of time? Check (3x). The One Ring haphazardly falling onto people's fingers? Check. The good guys escaping on giant birds? Check. At least we get a dragon this time that we, um, never really get to see. While the story is needlessly long - we wait 40 minutes just for Bilbo's decision to go on an adventure - there are other points that weigh this movie down. The first is the inexplicably terrible CGI; Jackson uses it for just about everything here and it looks fake 90% of the time. It appears as though for some reason, Jackson only saw fit to make sure Gollum was done correctly (which it was, amazingly so). Similarly, the wardrobe and make-up looks fake especially where the dwarves and Gandalf's hat are concerned. Then there's the matter of the dwarf leader who was so uncharismatic his name is not worth remembering. This element truly does the movie no good since he's a major character, but wait, isn't this movie about Bilbo? In fact, Bilbo (and to a lesser extent the dwarf leader) is about the only one who undergoes any character development and it's not much far too late into the movie. The Hobbit indicates for Jackson a director that is either trying too hard or not hard enough and it's tough to tell the difference. The result is that this film is more like Gandalf's 14 than a LOTR's pre-history.

Not ok.The movie I saw was good enough.  It was an enjoyable enough of a thing to see.  But, as a Hobbit fan (since the 5th grade), it was very frustrating to see all of the extra unnecessary stuff they put into the movie.  It reminded me a little of when I went to Universal studios and rode on a few of their rides.  I had to wait a long time to get onto the ride.  The ride itself lasted just a few minutes.  Then, when the ride was done, they dumped you right at the entrance of a gift shop that sold products about the ride that you were just on...all over priced and all marketed to you as intensely as anything in the history of man has ever been marketed.That's when you realize one thing...the entire experience you've just had, had very little to do with entertaining you.  90% of the experience you've just had was about getting you to spend more money (on top of the money you have already spent).When you realize that... When you realize that the bulk of the experience you've just had was more about getting you to take more money out of your pocket and less about entertaining you...several things happen.A) You feel like a target.  You don't feel safe.B) You feel like protecting yourself from the people who are providing you the entertainment.C) Whatever entertainment you did experience becomes less.It kind of reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons.  When I was a kid, we'd sit there and watch the Looney Tunes and laugh our heads off.  Then, through a completely different source of information, you'd read about a comic book featuring the Looney Tunes.  Some, would buy the book.  Others didn't.  The people who sold the cartoons made money from advertisers...and that was ok.  Sitting through some commercials was fine.  It was the price you had to pay in order to get the entertainment.Today though, the Saturday morning cartoons are nothing but advertising.  Everything about them is advertising.  And all of the gadgets, dolls and etc. are marketed, not only within the commercials, but also within the show itself (product placement)...etc.That's when you realize it.  The people who make these shows aren't doing something that everyone else who has a job has to do...  They aren't providing a service.Cooks cook.  Teachers teach.  Bus drivers drive buses.  Plumbers plum.  (Sorry, bad joke.)But what are these people doing?  After you give them money, what service are they providing to you?  If 90% of their effort is to get you to give them more money, then what you are getting for your money is another request for money.  That's the service they provide.  That's the service you are paying for.  You give money.  They ask for more.It's very frustrating and makes me not feel safe.",2,Hmmm...

Fantastic job in this regard.The animation of Smaug is fantastic! I can hardly wait to see all of his glory in the next movie.Some things I'm not too sure about is the introduction of the albino Orc. I'm not sure where this concept came from as if the book did not have enough going on. I understand the need for an enemy, but this enemy really came out of no where when compared to the book. With that said, the inclusion of this character did not take away from the movie. It basically made a central theme driving the dwarves and Bilbo through the adventure.Additionally, the introduction of the necromancer was also outside of the book. However, with the evil things going on in the movie and the book it gave some explanation to certain things not explained in the book.As always, Peter Jackson put together a fantastic fantasy in this movie. The entire storyline, including the added events, draw the viewer into the lands of middle earth. If I had one negative thing to say about the movie it would be that I wish they would have done this movie before LOTR. This is purely for flow and not because of contradictory elements within the movie. In fact, there are many references to events seen in LOTR.In all, great movie! I can hardly wait until the second one comes out and the extended versions hit the shelves.

I suppose my only minor complaint with the extended edition itself, is that I didn't really notice too much extended content.  Other than a few added shots and a new song by the Goblin King, the movie seems pretty much the same as the theatrical version.  That's fine though, it's still a fun ride.

I was correct, but pay no attention to the world. This film is as astounding and as full of authentic Tolkien spirit as any of the LOTR classics, more than able to shift gears to accommodate the completely different (but obviously interrelated) story of Bilbo's unique adventure. Just as Tolkien's 'Hobbit' was child-like and spare due to its narration by a simple Hobbit, there is necessarily a more buoyant, child-like spirit to this film (if one must compare it to the LOTR set), but it's hardly spare and do not think for a moment that it lacks the gravitas, creativity, whimsy, and inspiration of the other films. Many of our old heroes return, and some new ones are born. McKellan still thrills as lovably crusty Gandalf, wise beyond thought. Blanchett is more radiant than ever in her Galadriel cameo. The dwarves are outstanding to the last, with Thorin Oakenshield becoming a complex and worthy hero to rival Aragorn in the first films. Respect and deep care for the source-material is evident everywhere, from the still-majestic cinematography to the score to the writing to the casting. Our younger Bilbo is a gem -- easily winning hearts and our faith, as viewers, in a role that surely daunted, given Ian Holm's indelible first-impression. The effects, in a world that has become trapped in a love/hate relationship with effects, still astound due to the sensible craftsmanship. Poetic license remains poetic; Radagast and his racing Rhosgobel rabbits are a winsome joy and quite well-conceived. The action scenes are as awe-inspiring as ever, whether under the Misty Mountain in the domain of the Goblin King (fab VoiceOver by the legend Barry Humphries!) or at cliff's edge as wargs close-in on our intrepid band. If I were to detract a star it might be for pacing--there are a few minor hump-spots--but it wouldn't be for content, so five stars. The film resonates with luminous wonder and leaves so many other contemporary offerings in the dust, in terms of quality and spectacle. The Warner money-grab in December is annoying but to be expected, and I can't comment on corporate greed in giving a review about this product in and of itself. This Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultra package is THE MOVIE and it is cherished.

1449136,A24UPY3K2IMZYV,B0059XTU1S,Joseph Elliott,"[0, 0]","There was an unreal amount of hype for this film, following the enormously successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy, which collectively earned nearly 3 billion at the box office as well as 30 Oscar nominations (winning 17). A tough act to live up to, which explains why a lot of people were disappointed with An Unexpected Journey. While some of it is due to a few missteps by Jackson and company, some of it is beyond their control entirely. As has been stated many times, The Hobbit (or There And Back Again) is a breezy and whimsical fairy tale of only about 300 pages. Aimed primarily at children, the tone is much lighter and its conflict isn't quite as large scale or apocalyptic as The Lord of the Rings. In fact, The latter was written nearly twenty years after The Hobbit, aimed at the same audience who had grown up into adults, hence its more complex themes and narrative. Considering this, some of the disappointment people are harboring have to do more with the source material, not with Jackson's film making choices. However, there are missteps on Jackson's part, an overuse of cgi being chief among them. Orcs and goblins are now mostly computer effects, where as in LOTR they were real people with makeup effects and costumes. There is an authenticity with the makeup effects that is lost with cgi, making the orcs look less fearsome. It also means that The Hobbit trilogy will age much faster then the LOTR has, as cgi is improved constantly, outdating previous work every year. Another issue I had was how cartoonish some of the action is (most irksome for me is when Kili blocks incoming arrows with a ladder, then deflects them with his sword), but given the lighter nature and tone of the story, its possible to forgive. The biggest issue I have with the film is how the narrative focus rests on Thorin and the dwarves, rather then Bilbo (an issue that is magnified to an even greater extent in the second film).However, gripes aside, it is easy to see how Peter Jackson has grown as a director over the years; An Unexpected Journey is every bit as atmospheric as LOTR. The production design, cinematography, costuming, music and acting are every bit as good here as they were in LOTR, even if the story of The Hobbit lacks the dramatic chops of the former. Ian McKellen is in top form as Gandalf, Richard Armitage is fierce and proud, perfect as Thorin, and Martin Freeman, as Bilbo, is one of the very best casting decisions Jackson has made throughout his entire Middle Earth franchise. Freeman is perfect as the bumbling, unsure, and confused hobbit, making him both amusing and relatable in a way the hobbits haven't been before.An Unexpected Journey has been relentlessly criticized for its pacing and running time. The film is ridiculously close to the book, with a few changes made in order to include some of Tolkien's work in the appendices concerning the Necromancer and Dol Goldur. Seeing how The Hobbit is one continuous story told in a single novel, it goes without saying that pacing issues do arise by turning the story into a trilogy. Doing so provides one with a lot more time to spend in Middle Earth, but prevents The Hobbit from being the tightly edited masterpiece that the Lord of the Rings was. An Unexpected Journey therefore serves as a three hour introduction. When the movie finishes, there is a lack of true satisfaction, as if The Fellowship of the Ring had ended when Frodo and company arrived at Rivendell. The movie ends right when the story is beginning to heat up and get interesting. However, I personally like the slower pacing of An Unexpected Journey and the way it allows you to stop  and take in the sights of Middle Earth. It may not be fast paced, but it builds atmosphere and a sense of wonder beautifully, at least as well as the Lord of the Rings did, if not better. And there are some brilliantly executed scenes, chief among them being The Unexpected Party and Riddles in the Dark, where Andy Serkis makes a welcome and very exciting return as Gollum. In conclusion, An Unexpected Journey is not for everyone; one has to let go of what the film could have been if it had been a little more streamlined. If you are willing to accept it on its own terms, then it is a grand, majestic ride full of adventure and excitement.As for the extended edition, while its hard to recommend it over the theatrical cut (which played like an extended cut in and of itself), there are some amusing additions, chief among them a great little scene between Elrond and Bilbo at Rivendell, which I believe should have stayed in the theatrical cut. Other additions include a song by the Goblin King (dreadful), skinny dipping dwarves (hilarious, but a bit too silly), Bilbo and Thorin overhearing a conversation between Gandalf and Elrond (should have stayed in), and a scene in Hobbiton's marketplace, which is really a glorified throwback to Lord of the Rings. Except for the scene with Bilbo and Elrond, I would recommend the relatively leaner theatrical cut as far as the movie goes. However, the extras on the extended edition are themselves worth the cost, providing hours upon hours of insight into the making of the film. These are substantial extras that are the equal of what we got with the Lord of the Rings extended editions. Highly recommended if you are a fan of Jackson's Middle Earth.",4,Much better then people are saying,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,5345,"['was', 'unreal', 'amount', 'hype', 'film', 'following',

I was a bit aprehensive about how it would come across in 3-D (some 3-D movies are great, but some really fall short of being successful).  This movie was phemomenal! It is the best 3-D movie I have ever seen, and the action is non-stop from beginning to end. Special effects have gone far beyond LOTR in this film and I am really anticipating what they do to Smaug. It has to be the most fantastic dragon ever created.I first read the Hobbit and  the Lord of The Rings trilogy back in the sixties, and still own the original paperbacks, as well as some very nice hardbound collector sets. I never expect any movie to be just like the book. It would be impossible. As a serious LOTR fan, I was very pleased with the LOTR trilogy on film, and I am equally happy with the way the first segment of the Hobbit was translated to the screen. It is just so exciting seeing so many of the characters I read about come to life. And the best part of owning a movie like this is being able to watch it as frequently as I wish.I have been waiting patiently for the release of this movie in Blu Ray 3-D.  I have invested a great deal in a big screen 3-D TV and home theater system and even though there aren't many truely great 3-D movies available yet; this one has moved to the top of the list! It is an outstanding film and I can hardly wait for the extended version to be released. I don't mind investing in both the theatrical version and the extended version.

1449160,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B0059XTU1S,judy,"[5, 9]","Wow this film was a great rather long adventure, but its only the beginning, ha!!! This film unlike what everyone else is saying is trully a work of art. This film is sadly under estimated. Everyone is really just angry because they had to sit through a 3 hour film, but hey my motto is the longer the film is the more money its worth. Unlike the ""Lord Of the Ring"" series this film can be easily understood by people (like me) who have not read the book.I understand this movie might be alittle to much for everyone to like but if you clear your thoughts and just think to yourself ""this is going to be the best"", then it will be the best, but if you don't go in open minded you are going to find everything wrong with the film. Now on to the actual reviewing, i only have good news to review to you all. The good stuff includes the acting, cast, visual effects, length, costumes, new frame rate, and much much more. Ok the acting is excellent i loved it, the spotlight is on Martin Freeman,Richard Armitage, and Andy Serkis. Martin Freeman plays our funny little hobbit man in this jorney out of the three he is the best i loved him and his acting skills in the film, he put lots of effert into this film and he did well just as in Sherlock he is great in acting, and even though Andy Serkis is only in the film for about 20 minutes he uses his time wishly to make an impression on the audience , and he succeeds very well he is the most memerable acting of the three, and finally Richard Armitage, who gives a very realistic proformance, sorta a sad, angry man with mixed emotions , he really expresses his charactors emotions. Don't get me wrong everyone elses acting was great too, but those three stood out the most to me. The cast was.. Super, Peter Jackson knows what he is doing when casting the actors, every actor matches the charactor's personalitly , which is often rare but Peter knows what he is doing. The dwarf's actors looked like they would as dwarfs and its just great casting. The visual effects are so great, they are so well detailed, i meanman Peter score two , you made the monsters look so real, it is just so cool ,the animation is beautifully done, they looked like they were worked on for close to a year, it was just Oh My God great like Life of Pi. It was really good visual effecst that look so real, and well detailed that it looks like they are really getting thrown , or coming after the dwarfs. I don't know why everyone is always so angry and hating Peter Jackson's length in his films, everyone hated that King Kong was 3 hours, but i didn't i just thought it was even better, that we'd be able to see more excellent film. This film needed the longer running time to give us enough to walk out of the theater feeling like oh my gosh i must see more, ad its true that how i felt. The costumes were like really cool and well detailed , they looked really old fashioned and neat, they just blended with the actors really well and fit with the time period . Most people hate the new frame rate, saying that it looks to really or the charactors move to fast, well you want to know what i say? I think it makes it look great and more clear and realistic looking (in a good way) i just loved it. Really i don't care how fast the charactors can pick up items i don't pay much attention to that, i mean does it really matter? All i know is that it works - well. The only other things i have to mention is the goblin king scene , and the dwarfs. I found the line the gobin king says stupid as well as him being so easy to defeat. He says""well i guess it is that easy"" when he takes a swing and Gandalf hits his head and then slits his belly like he was nothing but he was like huge. The other thing is they didn't spend any time really on developing the dwarfs, there are just to many, maybe if they had acouple die by the end then it would have been better but they didn't and that is not good.

After 2 more viewings, I've concluded that my expectations were faulty. It's a different story, is written by Tolkien in a different tone, so the film is not going to have the same ""feel"" to it that ""The Fellowship"" had. This has a jaunty, jolly tone that wasn't in ""The Fellowship"" but I have been won over. I love the dwarfs (or dwarves? Not sure which is the correct term, but I'm going to go with ""dwarfs"" for this long-winded review because it's the word that isn't red-lined by Amazon.)It's long, but I feel that most of it is essential in telling the story properly, particularly since PJ has 3 entire films in which to cover all the action. It's lacking only the Bywater scene, but that's certainly not missed. I know that the initial scene in Bag End introducing each of the dwarfs is long, but we get to know them all individually so that later, during the many and intense action scenes, they don't become swallowed up into nothing more than a faceless crowd of dwarfs. We also get a lot of flash-back sequences, but they are necessary in order to establish the motivations of the company, Thorin in particular. I love what they've done with Thorin here. He's a darker character with a chip on his shoulder the size of The Lonely Mountain itself and is brooding and suspicious and impatient. He doubts Bilbo's commitment to the group from beginning to end and is quite vocal about it. Balin, fortunately, acts as the voice of reason for the audience as he explains some of Thorin's background for the edification of Bilbo and the younger dwarfs who are too young to have experienced all the history personally.All the action of the first 3rd of the story is here, but enhanced and turned up a few notches. Characters are more defined, the dangers are greater, the battles and escapes are more perilous and the ""Pale Orc/Azog,"" though not actually IN the original story, is brought in here to make Thorin's hatred and thirst for revenge more visible to the the viewer. In fact, when faced with Azog, Thorin becomes so enraged that he loses his focus and judgment.Many of the scenes, both action and exposition, give deliberate hints of Sauron's rapidly increasing presence outside of Mordor, setting the stage for the events of the The Trilogy in the future. With the exception of Galadriel the elves seem oddly and uncharacteristically unaware of these tell-tale signs of Sauron's imminent return. The events don't happen for another 60 years, but 60 years to an elf would be like 6 minutes to a mortal; it's a fairly brief period of time for them. They should already be suspicious of what's going on in Mordor, paricularly now that something ""evil"" has suddenly cropped up well outside of it. Gandalf certainly is suspicious. Also, Saruman makes a brief cameo appearance, teasing the audience into wondering how far he has gone at this point ""over to the dark side."" Is he already sneaking peeks at the palantir? What does he know already about Sauron that no one else suspects? Is he trying to discourage Gandalf's quest with the dwarfs for genuinely benevolent reasons or for more underhanded ones? We don't really know for sure, and at this point, I rather like the mystery. I hope at the end of the 3rd film we're given some insight on the Saruman of the future. (Christopher Lee has already stated that to him, Saruman is still a good and benevolent soul, but again, there's the matter that there are only 60 years between the events in The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy. Sauron is well on his way ""back;"" I would expect Saruman to be well aware of this by this stage; perhaps because he's already started looking into that cursed palantir.)The ""Riddles in the Dark"" is the pivotal scene. Andy Serkis has added dimensions to Gollum that are beyond even what Tolkien meant for him. He has the remarkable ability to make the character both sweet and innocent one moment, malicious and dangerous the next. He's both comical and malevolent. The scene lasts barely 15 minutes but it's the most compelling 15 minutes in the film. And we get to SEE the moment that Bilbo takes pity on Gollum and decides not to hurt him, linking that moment to the scene 60 years later when Frodo complains to Gandalf that it was a pity that Bilbo didn't kill Gollum when he had the chance. Gandalf reminds Frodo that it was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. And without Gollum, the ring would have never been destroyed. Earlier in the film, Gandalf tells Bilbo that ""true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one."" And that's when Bilbo decides to exhibit that courage.As much as I liked Radagast, as cute and funny as his scenes are, I found the scene in which he's trying to save the injured hedgehog a little too long. I'm not sure we needed him to be the one who explored Dol Guldur; Gandalf goes his own way apart from the company several times. There is no reason he couldn't have been the one to stumble upon the... ""foul creatures"" at some point and then explored the old fortress himself. But Radagast's rabbit sled and the diversion he creates as he draws the orcs and wargs away from the dwarf company was an inspired idea. AND I lovelovelove Sylvester McCoy!As one of the ""victims"" of the ""48-Hour Rental Misadventure,"" I was one of the lucky ones: I got to see it all the way through before it was yanked. A day later, the rental was available again, and because I'm a glutton for punishment, an incurable optimist and a hopelessly geeky fan of both Tolkien and Peter Jackson, I re-spent the $4.32 on another 48-rental. This one was a success; I watched it through two more times. I have no intention of buying any of it until the traditional, 4-disk, ""director's cut"" version is released next December before the 2nd film.

The bad news is that the CGI fight sequences are way over the top and have no credibility. The fight between the Stone Giants and the excape was far to fanciful and tiring to watch. The whole sequence should have been replaced by a much shorter and more believable event. The dwarves excape from the thousands of orcs under the mountain was also way over the top. Other viewers have described it as looking like a video game.

After just the first film (now I've seen 2 of 3) he made me a believer.

While they may not quite match the scale of some of the bonus features to Lord of the Rings (for example, they don't explain all over again why Tolkien's works have enduring interest; how he developed his world etc) there's plenty of interesting detail about how various scenes were shot, what felt particularly challenging to various actors, and many other details you just don't get when you only see the film in the theatre.

First he started with a great book(s), and then he carefully crafted a screenplay which stayed remarkably true to the source. In New Zealand he found the perfect location which he capitalized on with stunning cinematography. Most significantly he used the technological wizardry of computer generated imagery to great advantage. No doubt about it, The Lord of The Rings trilogy could never have been brought to film without CGI, but in Jackson's deft hands the CGI was never the main attraction. The CGI was always used in service of the story, never the other way around. This time Jackson did all of the important stuff wrong. Admittedly with The Hobbit Jackson has started with a lesser book, but instead of using his vision to elevate the original, he has succumbed to greed and diluted it. There is no other justification for reinterpreting a relatively short novel as a trio of full length movies. In order to fill all of that extra screen time Jackson had to write lots of extra material, and so he has strayed from his greatest initial achievement. He has failed to stay true to the book. As with the previous trilogy, the cast of this new series is strong and the location is stunning, but unlike his Lord of The Rings trilogy this interpretation of The Hobbit is just a weak excuse for one special effect after another. This time the CGI does not serve the story, it is the story. In Jackson's hands Tolkien's Hobbit has been reimagined as a non-stop roller coaster ride of successively ridiculous action scenes.

The books opened an entire world of diverse characters from the Elves & Dwarves to Man & Beasts. J.R.R. Tolkien introduced a world so detailed, it actually includes family trees of characters and their lineage, as well as a full scale look at the plants and trees and their origins, uses and so much more. It's almost unbelievable. As shown in the Lord of the Rings Movie franchise, a lot of content is not included that was in the books, but the story and diversity of time and locations is not missed. the LOTR Movies are amazingly depicted. I found that was also carried over to the newly introduced prequel: the Hobbit. In some ways, I actually liked the Hobbit movie more so than the LOTR Trilogy. It's not as action packed as the LOTR Movies, but there is so much emotional power which is so well displayed by the characters (a great cast of actors was used for this movie)and scenery, whether its animated or not. The animation is top notch (for now anyway) and it blends in so well it's incredible. Most importantly, Bilbo is played by an amazing actor - not sure what his name is - but oh man, he does such a good job in this, there are times you just want to pick that little hobbit up and squeeze the life out of him (in a nice way).

1449218,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0059XTU1S,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[43, 60]","Where Elijah Wood played his hobbit, Frodo, as a picture of childlike innocence in a big world, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo as a flustered everyman. His essential Edwardian Englishness, based on predictability and decorum and stability, is almost the exact opposite of the dwarves he accompanies, led by Richard Armitage (who will surely become a name star behind this film). And that tension drives this story forward.Tolkien's mythmaking, which is perhaps less sophisticated than in ""the Lord of the Rings"" but no less compelling, relies on two visions of England. The dwarves, eager to reclaim their homeland, are an older, more virile England, that of Shakespeare, Wellington, and the Norman Conquests. Bilbo, with his corduroy jacket and pipe, is the inward-turning England of the years after the empire. Take away either, and England would lose its Englishness.Bilbo thinks the dwarves savage, unkempt, and barbaric. The dwarves consider Bilbo sedentary, effete, and useless. Director Peter Jackson plays this out longer and more explicitly than Tolkien did in his book, which took such distinctions as written. This film is about how the young man and the old man can't stand each other, even as they need each other, and the one gradually turns into the other.Jackson takes pains to emphasize this film's connections to his previous LotR trilogy, finding ways to incorporate sets and characters from the prior films, whether or not they were in the book. But he also distinguishes this film from the prior. Its humor is more explicit and its characters more archetypal, less gritty. And as a story involving no humans, this movie is more absolutely fantasy than Jackson's prior trilogy.It would have been easy for Peter Jackson to produce ""LotR Redux,"" and it probably would have made him even more famous.

1449219,A7WH560VVUXB2,B0059XTU1S,Kevin M. Derby,"[0, 2]","As a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR films, I had mixed thoughts going into ""The Hobbit."" The novel simply is not the stuff for a movie trilogy. With almost universal condemnation of Jackson's high speed filming efforts, I was expecting ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to be as bad as George Lucas' revisiting the Star Wars Universe in ""The Phantom Menace.""So do we have Bilbo Binks here? Not quite. The high speed filming works on the landscapes but simply doesn't work on the actors. Fake feet and prosthetic noses look like too much like fake feet and prosthetic noses when all is said and done. The plot does seem a bit stretched out. Even with some new scenes setting the stage for the LOTR movies, I can see two films here but not three.The cast is solid. Martin Freeman is fine as Bilbo. Ian McKellan slides back nicely into the role of Gandalf. Richard Armitage is solid as Thorin Oakenshield. Cameos of characters from the original trilogy--Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Elijah Woods--are excellent. Andy Serkins once again amazes as Gollum in the high point of the movie. A host of dwarves get their moments but the only one who truly gets fleshed out is Balin, excellently played by Ken Stott.It's certainly fun to revisit old friends like Gandalf and Elrond. With so many familiar locations--the Shire, Rivendell, even what appears to be Weathertop--fans of the original films should enjoy this movie even if it does not match the magic of the LOTR films. Still, while there are some fun action scenes at the end, the movie drags a little too much to be great and the high speed filming is often distracting. If not a great film though, there`s enough in ""An Unexpected Journey"" to recommend it.",4,Not the Second Coming of LOTR But Not the Second Coming of Jar Jar Binks Either,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,1742,"['huge', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'LOTR', 'films', 'had', 'mixed', 'thoughts', 'going', 'Hobbit', 'novel', 'simply', 'not', 'stuff', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'almost', 'universal', 'condemnation', 'Jackson', 'high', 'speed', 'filming', 'efforts', 'was', 'expecting', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'George', 'Lucas', 'revisiting', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Universe', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'So', 'do', 'have', 'Bilbo', 'Binks', 'here', 'Not', 'quite', 'high', 'speed', 'filming', 'works', 'landscapes', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'actors', 'Fake', 'feet', 'prosthetic', 'noses', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'fake', 'feet', 'prosthetic', 'noses', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'plot', 'seem', 'bit', 'stretched', 'out', 'Even', 'new', 'scenes', 'setting', 'stage', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'films', 'here', 'not', 'three.The', 'cast', 'solid', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'fine', 'Bilbo', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'back', 'nicely', 'role', 'Gandalf', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'solid', 'Thorin', 'Oakenshield', 'Cameos', 'characters', 'original', 'trilogy', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Elijah', 'Woods', 'are', 'excellent', 'Andy', 'once', 'again', 'Gollum', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'host', 'dwarves', 'get', 'moments', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Balin', 'excellently', 'played', 'Ken', 'Stott.It', 'certainly', 'revisit', 'old', 'friends', 'Gandalf', 'Elrond', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'locations', 'Shire', 'Rivendell', 'even', 'what', 'be', 'Weathertop', 'fans', 'original', 'films', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'match', 'magic', 'LOTR', 'films', 'Still', 'are', 'fun', 'action', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'great', 'high', 'speed', 'filming', 'often', 'distracting', 'not', 'great', 'film', 's', 'enough', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'recommend']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

However, since Einstein's relativity won't cooperate and there is a limit to computer enhancement of an aged actor, I looked for any sign of depth that was, by design, missing from Bilbo.  I found it at the very end of the movie, when Bilbo says he wants to help the Dwarves regain the home and hearth he himself was so reluctant to leave, reluctant because he had it.  They didn't, and everyone deserves a home.  Perhaps, more than anything, this is why Jackson decided to make three movies out of such a short story.

Their journey will take them into the Wild, through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, as well as a mysterious and sinister figure known only as the Necromancer.Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the Goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever...Gollum.Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's ""precious"" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.The cast led by Ian McKellen (as Gandalf) & Martin Freeman (as Bilbo Baggins) is great.

You get to see the fight between Smaug and the people of Dale, which is shown more in the latest Hobbit film. The added scenes helps the continuity between this film and the Desolation of Smaug, by showing the black arrows and the white stones that are mentioned by the Elf King.

1449272,A3IQQJPGZ2RDN7,B0059XTU1S,Learner,"[2, 5]","Jackson has created an alternate-Hobbit, which yet remains enough like the book to engage fans.The movie does pretty much tell the story of the book. Yet it also adds or emphasizes things the book does not. Much of the stuff the movie adds beyond the books is there to tie the Hobbit into the overall story of the Lord of the Rings movies, to foreshadow what is to come. I liked this.Like probably all Tolkien fans, I have some quibbles with this movie. The dwarves' song by Bilbo's fire about the dragon's gold near the beginning was too short - it was a great scene, and it's important in the book, but it's too brief in the movie. Also, the dwarves weren't quite dwarf enough. Also, as usual these days in Hollywood, the action and violence was excessive. I would have preferred a story closer to the book's original children's fantasy.The character of Bilbo is also made a little more heroic, a little less timid than the book. I'm not sure if I like this, but it works in the movie.One quibble I do NOT have is the length of the movie. I didn't feel like the movie was too long. However, when I watch it again I will be fast-forwarding past the fighting scenes, which I find tedious and superficial in most movies. The beginning also did drag a little. But as a Tolkien fan I don't begrudge spending those extra minutes in the marvelous world of Middle Earth.Of course, this movie is just the first third of the story. I look forward to the remaining two sequels. Of course I hope they are as good as this first one. Based on Jackson's track record with four Tolkien movies so far, I'm optimistic.It's obvious to me now after seeing this first Hobbit movie that Jackson is taking Tolkien's Hobbit, a children's story, and re-imagining it as a full-blown epic in its own right, to stand alongside his Lord of the Rings trilogy. After thinking about it, I like this. If I want the original Hobbit I can (and will) read the book again.The thing I like about Jackson's Tolkien movies is that they portray characters and settings exactly as I pictured them from the books, yet the movies are different enough that they don't spoil my future re-reading of the books. I can enjoy both the books and the movies as parallel but not equivalent experiences.On the whole, this movie was a marvelously successful effort that fans should not miss.Note: This review is based on a theater viewing, since the DVD is currently not out yet. I intentionally saw the ""regular"" version - not 3D, not High Frame Rate. I was pretty sure I would enjoy the regular version best.",5,Children's Story becomes Action Epic,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2557,"['Jackson', 'created', 'alternate-Hobbit', 'yet', 'enough', 'book', 'engage', 'fans.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'book', 'also', 'things', 'book', 'not', 'Much', 'stuff', 'movie', 'books', 'there', 'tie', 'Hobbit', 'overall', 'story', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'foreshadow', 'what', 'come', 'liked', 'this.Like', 'probably', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'have', 'quibbles', 'movie', 'dwarves', 'song', 'Bilbo', 'fire', 'dragon', 'gold', 'beginning', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'important', 'book', 'too', 'brief', 'movie', 'Also', 'dwarves', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dwarf', 'enough', 'Also', 'usual', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'violence', 'was', 'excessive', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'story', 'closer', 'book', 'original', 'children', 'fantasy.The', 'character', 'Bilbo', 'also', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'heroic', 'little', 'less', 'timid', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'movie.One', 'quibble', 'do', 'NOT', 'have', 'length', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'However', 'when', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'fast-forwarding', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'find', 'tedious', 'superficial', 'most', 'movies', 'beginning', 'also', 'did', 'drag', 'little', 'Tolkien', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'spending', 'extra', 'minutes', 'marvelous', 'world', 'Middle', 'Earth.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'just', 'first', 'third', 'story', 'look', 'forward', 'remaining', 'two', 'sequels', 'course', 'hope', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'Based', 'Jackson', 'track', 'record', 'four', 'Tolkien', 'movies', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'obvious', 'now', 'seeing', 'first', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'Jackson', 'taking', 'Tolkien', 'Hobbit', 'children', 'story', 're-imagining', 'full-blown', 'epic', 'own', 'right', 'stand', 'alongside', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'thinking', 'like', 'want', 'original', 'Hobbit', 'can', 'will', 'read', 'book', 'thing', 'like', 'Jackson', 'Tolkien', 'movies', 'portray', 'characters', 'settings', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'books', 'yet', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'future', 're-reading', 'books', 'can', 'enjoy', 'books', 'movies', 'parallel', 'not', 'equivalent', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'marvelously', 'successful', 'effort', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'miss.Note', 'review', 'based', 'theater', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'currently', 'not', 'out', 'yet', 'intentionally', 'saw', 'regular', 'version', 'not', '3D', 'not', 'High', 'Frame', 'Rate', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'regular', 'version', 'best']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

This is an opportunity to do even more Three Stooge type comedy with blows being exchanged, eyes being poked, guts being punched, burps, farts, arse-scratching and other gross-out humour. It holds up the movie for at least another hour or so. Who the hell was this aimed at? Even kids would tire of it before ten minutes was up.Editing seems to have been the first casualty to ensure length!The movie is SO obviously ""padded"" to increase the duration of this seemingly interminable piece so a trilogy can be squeezed out of the original very slim volume.The 3D is also wanked shamelessly.Remember early 3D when everything long and pointy was aimed directly towards the camera to amaze us with the capabilities of this new innovation?Well here we have HUGE depths at every possible moment, and crossed by fragile bridges that fall down in ways most contrary to the laws of physics, ...precariously narrow paths wind along precipitous cliffs again plunging into bottomless crevasses, (off which people ALMOST fall so constantly of course),.....huge boulders and rocks raining from above in massive showers, (that miss everyone of course. Absolutely NO opportunity to over-use the capabilities of 3D is passed up here folks!Is it a ""kid's movie"", ...or is there something for the adult therein?If there was anything for the over nines, then I'm very much afraid I completely missed it.I had such high hopes for this, considering the prior efforts regarding sets, costumes, direction, cinematography etc.I was NOT in any way expecting to see ""Indiana Jones and the Hobbits do Panto"".Yes, there's even a spherical boulder that comes rolling down the path, just like in Indiana!I kept thinking this movie would at some stage manage to at least make some pale imitation of its worthy predecessors, but it just doesn't. EVER!!!Kate Blanchett mopes and moons around briefly, playing Galadriel as if she is on an intense lithium treatment plus anti-depressants, looking totally doped to the gills rather than anything ethereal. Her comatose monotonal voice is something from the crypt!Ian McKellar is perhaps the one saving grace of this whole shemozzle, ...but he so often just disappears off somewhere, only to re-appear at the last possible minute to be used as a deus-ex-machina to save-the-day when the hobbits are in trouble. Not once mind you, but several times!And if he is indeed a wizard, ...and he demonstrates a few times that he certainly is, ...then why is he SO reluctant to use his powers when they are so very much in need? (Like being under forcible attack by a mob of ugly great Orcs riding the CGI equivalents of the Hound of the Baskervilles?)The whole movie is trite, simplistic, truly corny, and an insult to Tolkien. However what it is most of all is FAR TOO LONG, and it does serious and probably irreparable damage to the impressive franchise that's gone before.See it ONLY if you like the slap-stick carry on of Christmas panto, ....can endure dizzying 3D CGI as the driving force over very little narrative, .....and can sit still for the VERY lengthy time this over-long, over-blown self-indulgent piece of crap takes to play out.Where the hell was the editing? Was there indeed any done at all, ...or was this just dispensed with to ensure there was enough footage to make three movies?If I could give NO STARS for this execrable effort I would. Bitterly disappointing all round, ...and to think there are two more to go?What a cynical grab for money.",1,Indiana Jones and the Hobbits do Christmas Panto,1358294400,"01 16,

CHARLOT,"[1, 1]","I won't wade into the war currently being waged between Tolkien ""purists"" and Peter Jackson loyalists over the changes Jackson made to Bilbo's story as told in this film adaptation. At least not very deeply. Suffice it to say that these changes are many, and some of them are HUGE departures from the original story that were hard for me to swallow the first time I saw this movie in a cinema.  However, I have to say that much of the extra footage in this Extended edition is crucial, and I wish it had been included in the theatrical version. If you are wondering if the $10 extra for this Extended edition is worth it, I would answer that as an unqualified ""yes"". If you have never seen this film, and your purchase of this BluRay will be your first viewing of it, let me just say that Martin Freeman does a very good job of portraying a younger Bilbo Baggins; he doesn't look like Ian Holm did as Bilbo in LOTR, but I think he projects the spirit and attitudes of Tolkien's Bilbo very nicely. If you can accept that this film was made to: 1. make oodles of money for the producers, and 2. appeal to and entertain as wide an audience as possible, and if you keep it in mind that 80 years have passed since J.R.R Tolkiien wrote the original story, hopefully you can keep an open mind about Peter Jackson's handling of the plot lines and story and just enjoy it as an entertainment.You might want to consider that the additions in this film flesh out some characters, like Radagast and Saruman, that were barely mentioned in Tolkien's novel of The Hobbit, and that other changes add links to tie The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings together more seamlessly. Whether or not these changes were TOO drastic is up to you to judge, personally, I appreciate the extra element of pure storytelling pleasure I got from most of Jackson's additions.I also want to note that Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Andy Serkis (Smeagol/Gollum), and Christopher Lee (Saruman),  all reprise their LOTR characters wonderfully, and the fact that this movie actually takes you inside the White Council (which the novel just barely mentions), is great, and I'm glad that Peter Jackson provided time for it in the screenplay. Without the White Council scene, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee would not have had parts in this film, and their characters are fun to watch.  So throw some popcorn in the microwave and get settled in your most comfortable chair - this is a long movie (2 hours 50 minutes) and you won't want to pause it, at least not on the first viewing.

I wasn't one of those who read it in elementary; my father first gave it to me then, but I didn't get into it.  Then The Fellowship of the Ring came out and I just had to read the books so I would know how it all turned out.  Waiting for the other two movies was not an option.  But yes, I started with THE HOBBIT.  I loved the books, but I haven't read them again since.  I'm not sure why.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - movie version - contained the two scenes not involving Smaug that I remembered most clearly, the trolls and the riddle game.  There were a few things that I knew were absolutely not in the book, such as there being both goblins and orcs.  (Also, a necromancer?  What?)  Other things I've found afterwards were small details in the book expanded to ten minute action sequences.  And that makes sense to me - action sequences play even better on the screen than in a novel.I honestly have no clue why Peter Jackson is turning The Hobbit into a trilogy.  I think most of the changes he made worked.  This version will tie in tightly to his Lord of the Rings.  But while I enjoyed this film, I have no clue how there is enough of THE HOBBIT left to make two more films.  But honestly, the man has delivered good films so far, so I am inclined to trust him.  I was quite wary of An Unexpected Journey, and then I absolutely loved it.Jackson has a knack for casting.  Even when I knew the faces, they tended to disappear into their roles.  I didn't realize Kili was Aiden Turner (Mitchell in Being Human) until the credits rolled.  And he's incredibly lucky, because apparently Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving haven't aged in ten years.  It's uncanny.Although he adds in scenes to tie The Hobbit more closely to The Lord of the Rings, Jackson's adaptation proves that he understood the difference between the books.  This is a funnier movie, and he keeps several of the songs.  I am very tempted to buy the soundtrack.  I feel sorry for anyone in anyway related to high school band, because I am sure a large number of shows next year will be based on Howard Shore's score.  (I can still remember all of The Lord of the Rings shows I sat though in high school.  Thankfully my school couldn't afford the popular stuff.)I did attend a high-frame rate showing.  In case you haven't heard, Jackson shot The Hobbit at twice the usual frame rate.  Reports so far haven't been glowing.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it added anything to the movie.  (My dad concurs.)  It was most noticeable in brightly lit scenes.  If you ever watch making of documentaries, it looks like when they show bits of raw footage from angles that weren't used in the final film.  As for the 3D, it didn't really add anything either.  It's a beautiful film, but not one where things are leaping at you.  I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen, but I don't think you'll lose anything by attending an el cheapo 2D showing.If you were sitting on the fence, I say go for it.

1449307,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,B0059XTU1S,London Fog,"[17, 21]","Since I had heard both negative and positive reviews before watching, I went into this with no expectations of it adhering closely to the book, nor did I have any intentions of comparing the Hobbit to the LOTR trilogy. That being said, all throughout, there seemed to be a needless theme of Peter Jackson making those comparisons for us - The Hobbit is meant to be a more lighthearted tale, but time and again extra scenes were included that made the attempt to resemble LOTR both visually and with the theme of darkness and oppression. Even that I would have forgiven had the pacing not been so torturous. From the first fifteen minutes onward, even during those few instances when this movie remained true to the spirit of the book, scenes were constructed in such a way as to fatally cripple the pace - in other words, due to poor directing, lively scenes were made to drag. This pacing problem continued throughout, moving from congealed treacle slow to so rapid they literally spend nearly two consecutive hours of the movie being chased, mostly by Orcs.The actual length was three hours fifty minutes. I ended up watching this in three increments, because it was impossible to sit through a movie that was mired in a sea of CGI, and where even many of the action sequences were dull due to the inclusion of too many of such. I honestly think a spectacular movie could have been made if many of the scenes therein were simply abridged. About an hour into the movie was approximately 1/3 into the book, and while I am not making comparisons, per se, it does go to show just how much extraneous material was thrown in.There was entirely too much effort poured into the CGI - to be honest, I am not a fan of computer imagery unless it serves to enhance the storyline instead of being used to carry it entirely. It was all too obvious that the energy was focused on creating dazzling visuals in lieu of focusing on character depth - except, perhaps, for Thorin - and dialogue that served to move things forward. While much was going on, little was actually happening, if that makes sense. Had I not read the book, if someone were to ask me what the first movie was about, my answer would be hazy. We learn tidbits about Thorin, Gandalf and Bilbo, yet all the other dwarves merely serve as extras and even then, the development of the former three left much to be desired.Overall, I could not say this was an enjoyable movie. It did have it's good moments. Some excellent ones, even. But for a movie of this length, those were just too sparse. Nor was Martin Freeman's portrayal enough to salvage this train wreck of pacing and tedious overuse of special effects. My main gripe is not even that The Hobbit quite often bore little resemblance to Toliken's work, but that this movie reeked of pure Hollywood. A dumbed down action extravaganza with a ton of style and absolutely no substance. As a fan of BBC's 'Sherlock', I was excited about Cumberbatch's voicing of Smaug, though I am not certain if I have enough of a masochistic streak to sit through a second or third installment of this boring, puerile nonsense.",2,Spectacularly Boring,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,3115,"['had', 'heard', 'negative', 'positive', 'reviews', 'watching', 'went', 'expectations', 'adhering', 'closely', 'book', 'did', 'have', 'intentions', 'comparing', 'Hobbit', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'being', 'said', 'seemed', 'be', 'needless', 'theme', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'making', 'comparisons', 'Hobbit', 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'tale', 'time', 'again', 'extra', 'scenes', 'were', 'included', 'made', 'attempt', 'resemble', 'LOTR', 'visually', 'theme', 'darkness', 'oppression', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'forgiven', 'had', 'pacing', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'torturous', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'onward', 'even', 'few', 'instances', 'when', 'movie', 'remained', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'scenes', 'were', 'constructed', 'such', 'way', 'fatally', 'cripple', 'pace', 'other', 'words', 'due', 'poor', 'directing', 'lively', 'scenes', 'were', 'made', 'drag', 'pacing', 'problem', 'continued', 'moving', 'congealed', 'treacle', 'slow', 'so', 'rapid', 'literally', 'spend', 'nearly', 'two', 'consecutive', 'hours', 'movie', 'being', 'chased', 'mostly', 'Orcs.The', 'actual', 'length', 'was', 'three', 'hours', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'three', 'increments', 'was', 'impossible', 'sit', 'movie', 'was', 'mired', 'sea', 'CGI', 'where', 'even', 'many', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'dull', 'due', 'inclusion', 'too', 'many', 'such', 'honestly', 'think', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'simply', 'abridged', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'approximately', '1/3', 'book', 'am', 'not', 'making', 'comparisons', 'se', 'go', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'extraneous', 'material', 'was', 'thrown', 'in.There', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'poured', 'CGI', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'computer', 'imagery', 'enhance', 'storyline', 'instead', 'being', 'used', 'carry', 'entirely', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', 'energy', 'was', 'focused', 'creating', 'dazzling', 'visuals', 'lieu', 'focusing', 'character', 'depth', 'perhaps', 'Thorin', 'dialogue', 'served', 'move', 'things', 'forward', 'much', 'was', 'going', 'little', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'sense', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'someone', 'were', 'ask', 'what', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'answer', 'would', 'be', 'hazy', 'learn', 'tidbits', 'Thorin', 'Gandalf', 'Bilbo', 'yet', 'other', 'dwarves', 'merely', 'serve', 'extras', 'even', 'then', 'development', 'former', 'three', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired.Overall', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'excellent', 'ones', 'even', 'movie', 'length', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'sparse', 'was', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'enough', 'salvage', 'train', 'wreck', 'pacing', 'tedious', 'overuse', 'special', 'effects', 'main', 'gripe', 'not', 'even', 'Hobbit', 'quite', 'often', 'bore', 'little', 'resemblance', 'Toliken', 'work', 'movie', 'reeked', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'dumbed', 'down', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'ton', 'style', 'absolutely', 'substance', 'fan', 'BBC', ""'Sherlock"", 'was', 'excited', 'Cumberbatch', 'voicing', 'Smaug', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'have', 'enough', 'masochistic', 'streak', 'sit', 'second', 'third', 'installment', 'boring', 'puerile', 'nonsense']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449309,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B0059XTU1S,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[2, 5]","Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, King Kong) has entered the world of J.R.R. Tolkien again and for me with a very slow start. Fran Walsh (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Philippa Boyens (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro(Pan's Labyrinth, Mimic) all helmed the screenplay and seemingly did a nice effort to capture the innocence of Bilbo Baggins if a little short on substance.Well let's talk about the stand out performances - surprisingly Martin Freeman (who is also amazing as Dr. John Watson on the new BBC series Sherlock and Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy) did an honest and light-hearted, yet believable performance starring as the lead Hobbit, Bilbo. Martins charm and frustration as well as his curiousness of the world outside his hole was  very sincere and real.Ian McKellen (X-Men, God's and Monsters) does what he does best, gives Gandalf a real and passionate tone and feel - making him the true wise man and leader of this band of Dwarfs and one Hobbit. Not unfamiliar with the character, Gandalf, having played him three times before, we now see a more curious and lighter side that makes him a delight to watch.I must give a special nod to Sylvester McCoy (8th Doctor Who, El Dorado) playing Radagst. He is funny, quirky and extremely hyperactive in his efforts of saving the dwarfs and woodland creatures. Sylvester gives his total energy and passion in his performance and rides rabbits like I have never seen before.Now my favorite scene is the scene in the film with Bilbo and Gollum who first meet and go into a battle of wits with each other. Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Tin Tin), who is never on camera for Freeman's performance one-on-one because Gollum is stop-motion captured, gives a creepy and stunning performance as the once Hobbit gone bad. Andy's humor and duel personality of what Gollum represents is spot on and reminded me most of the original book itself.The film opens with a wonderful showcase of Tolkien veteran characters Frodo and older Bilbo played masterfully by retruening performers Ian Holm (Alien, Fifth Element) and Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, 9) who both have some great scenes together that will warm your heart and memories.Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Captain America) is back as Elrond - head of the Elfans, Cate Blanchett (Aviator, The Missing) is back as the Elfan Galadriel and the ominous Christopher Lee (Phantom Menace, Dark Shadows) is back as the wizard Saruman, although not too prominent as of yet. (Wink, wink.)Howard Shore's (Hugo, Doubt) score is amazing (and there is another review of his score for this film here on this site as well) and it actually evokes a lot of the feeling and passion for the friendships that develop in this film.Hopefully the sequels, `The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' (due in 2013) and `The Hobbit: There and Back Again' (due in 2014) will do what the `Rings' trilogies did, they just became better with each successive film.I think this is defiantly a family friendly film and has a lot of offer the in respect to keeping true to the original novel. Although, I would read the book before and after seeing the film because although the film does give you a perspective of how Peter Jackson was attempting to fill in the story for a two plus hour first film, the book has more meat and depth to it for me. (As all books usually do, of course!) I was slightly disappointed but entertained with the film overall. (However, special note that if you see this in IMAX digital, this film comes with a nine minute preview/trailer of `Star Trek Into Darkness', don't miss that. In my two screenings of `The Hobbit', both with packed sold-out houses, the audience gave more of a response to Star Trek Trailer than Bilbo Baggins.

I enjoyed watching The Hobbit, however I think he missed the mark a bit with his interpretation.  The casting is good - although I definitely pictured the dwarves as -- well, a bit more like Gimli in Lord of the Rings.  These dwarves are too cute - and who knew they were Irish?  The thing I remember about reading The Hobbit as a child is that it was innocent.  The adventures were not as dark as Lord of the Rings.  The danger was really the Dragon - and the dark power that was rising was not really dealt with in The Hobbit.  This movie, in my opinion, misses the mark there.  Jackson is trying to set the stage for the darker tale to follow, and inserts too many things into the movie that were not in the book.

1449334,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0059XTU1S,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","&#34;Elen sila lumenn' omentielvo&#34; - a bright star shines indeed on our meeting with this new great, wonderful adventure...I just saw &#34;Hobbit&#34; and I was VERY impressed! Below you will find the reasons why I liked this film so much, with some limited SPOILERS.1. A successful combination of great fidelity to Tolkien's vision with some skilful alterations. In second part of LOTR (&#34;Two Towers&#34;) Peter Jackson allowed himself some very considerable liberties with the characters of king Theoden of Rohan and captain Faramir of Gondor, and as a consequence he harmed this one part of his great trilogy. He clearly learned his lesson and in this film, even if there are some differences between the scenario and the original book, those modification were done with a great skill, good taste and in deep respect with the general vision contained in Tolkien's books in general.Amongst those successful modifications are a greater development of the story of Smaug's coming to Erebor, of dwarves wanderings and their wars with Orcs from Moria (those last elements are taken from original annexes to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;) and a larger inclusion of scary and extremely creepy Dol Guldur fortress (which is only briefly mentioned in the book). There is also a longer and more dramatic chapter devoted to Great Goblin's caves, a brief but impressive look at stone giants (creatures only suggested in Tolkien's lore) and last but not least, some real screen time devoted to Radagast the Brown, an extremely odd but very, very attaching character. Radagast also shows in this film that he is definitely a force to be reckoned with and not just a sidekick - although, as Saruman venomously suggests it, he also appears to be all the time &#34;tripping on 'shrooms&#34;...)))There is also more place devoted to the White Council (with Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf present and Radagast and Cirdan absent) and those passages come in fact from the annexes to LOTR rather than from &#34;Hobbit&#34; itself. Finally, even if many good jokes are included, the general tone of this film is more serious than in the book, with the dwarves being a little less comically represented and their leader, prince Thorin Oakshield, being a much more impressive character, conserving a very great dignity and majesty even when being stuffed in a troll's bag...)))Finally, the leader of Moria Orcs at the time of dwarves expedition is still Azog the Defiler rather than his son Bolg - but I forgive willingly Peter Jackson this change, as Azog is a really IMPRESSIVE creature! On another hand, and this is one of the very few things I found a little objectionnable, Orcs seem to not fear sunlight in this film (Goblins of Misty Mountains on another hand still fear the light of the day) - but after all it is a rather minor thing.As you can see Peter Jackson changed the story for the needs of his &#34;Hobbit&#34; trilogy, but he did it with the greatest care and by showing this time the greatest respect to the general spirit of Tolkien's works.2. A great mastery of the visual aspect of the film. The images of Middle Earth are breath-taking, the creatures (good and evil) are excellent and the costumes and weaponry simply perfect.3. Gollum; All the chapter about Bilbo's meeting with Gollum is pure perfection and in this film we finally can realise how REALLY DANGEROUS this creature is!4. Tom Troll, William Troll and Bert Troll. Hilarious and scary in the same time, their moment in the film is simply a treasure.5. Goblins of the Misty Mountains. In this film we have a real insight into goblin's government (tyranny), administration (anarchy), strategy (mostly blunt force trauma) and communications, although the little pearl about this last point, you will have to discover by yourself...)))6. Dwarves/elves mutual cultural shock - one of the best scenes of the film...)))7. Music. It mostly uses the same themes than in LOTR (ex. Shire theme, Rivendell theme, Ring theme, Company theme, etc.) which gives a familiar feeling of continuity, with just enough new elements to underline the fact that we are in a different chapter of Tolkien's tales.8. Action scenes - they are many and of excellent quality, thanks to some modifications of the story by Peter Jackson (see above). They help also to set a rather fast rhythm of events, once the initial Shire chapter is concluded. If you think that to make a trilogy out of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; Peter Jackson had to drag things and slow the events, well, think again... This is a reasonably long film but I didn't feel the time pass.9. Actors. Unlike in LOTR II &#34;Two Towers&#34; (when he seriously blundered by casting Miranda Otto as Eowyn), in this film Peter Jackson didn't commit any mistakes in the choice of actors. Martin Freeman is more than perfect in his interpretation of Bilbo - for me, after two minutes, he WAS Bilbo - all right, OK, maybe they just should have given him ten pounds more around the waist in the first part of the trilogy, but this is just a detail. Ian McKellen is of course perfect as Gandalf. Richard Armitage as Thorin is THE revelation of this film. Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee are of course brilliant - and Cate Blanchett swept me of my feet in this film (something that didn't happen in the LOTR...).The one objection I could have is that I didn't quite picture Balin, the friendliest of dwarves, as being that old - but this is a very minor detail.10. Clever little details of the scenario. Peter Jackson put in the scenario some little but significant details which explain better some important questions, like why did Gandalf wanted SO MUCH to help Thorin Oakenshield in his quest and why exactly did he choose precisely Bilbo Baggins as the &#34;burglar&#34; for the Company. Those little details didn't figure in the book, but they are VERY faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's story - and it is a very precious thing...CONCLUSION: Since attacking the LOTR Peter Jackson learned a lot in last 10 years and he put all this experience to good use in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; - and the result is immediately visible on the screen. This film is on the same very high level of quality as LOTR I and III and BETTER than LOTR II. In some aspects he even did a better job than in LOTR, because here he had to manage a Company larger than the Fellowship of the Ring (15 characters instead of 9) - and he succeeded very, very well indeed. I loved this film and I cannot wait to see &#34;The desolation of Smaug&#34;.",5,"""Elen sila lumenn' omentielvo"" - a bright star shines indeed on our meeting with this new great, wonderful

1449337,A18TQ16JSAXSPQ,B0059XTU1S,maineacgirl,"[1, 2]","Saw this movie in theaters -- twice.  The first time, I went on opening night with a group from my literature class.  We had just finished reading ""The Hobbit"" and everyone had liked the book--we couldn't wait to see it visually.  It blew us away.  Definitely not the same as Lord of the Rings, but in the same world.  The humor was fantastic, the acting superb, the storytelling (as always) excellent.  I loved seeing Richard Armitage's, Martin Freeman's, and Andy Serkis' (Gollum) work -- they all did a great job, especially Freeman.  The actor really nailed Bilbo's character and manner.  He really made me see the similarities between his character and the older version played by Ian Holme.  Armitage played a very heroic Thorin--I hadn't actually liked Thorin's character until I saw it off-page and on screen.  The writers and actors were able to pull the best bits of each character and bring it to light.The graphics (for me) were a little less than par, mostly because they screamed CG to me (as opposed to the LOTR's very real, very cool fellbeasts and wargs.  Why did the change the warg design?  They were already so terrifying in the Two Towers.)  But Gollum was great and the lighting in this movie was so beautiful.This movie is definitely not for everyone--if you aren't really a fantasy lover or a Tolkein fan, I understand comepletely.  But if you loved the book, there is no reason not to love the movie.  It was so hiliarious and touching to hear Tolkein's words--spoken by Bilbo or Gandalf--and the dialogue in Riddles in the Dark.  Every person owned their character and their moments.My favorite parts of the movie were the Contract Scene (I loved how the seemingly unrealistic part of the book was used in a humorous way), the Riddles in the Dark Scene (who can't like that?) and Thorin's charge down the burning tree (awesome!).  The dwarves' theme, the Misty Mountains, was terrific, as was the credit song ""Song of the Lonely Mountain"" which echoed the dwarves' pride, hope, and vengeance.I can hardly wait for Hobbit 2.",5,The Hobbit,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,2049,"['Saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'opening', 'night', 'group', 'literature', 'class', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Hobbit', 'everyone', 'had', 'liked', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'visually', 'blew', 'away', 'Definitely', 'not', 'same', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'same', 'world', 'humor', 'was', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'superb', 'storytelling', 'always', 'excellent', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Gollum', 'work', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'especially', 'Freeman', 'actor', 'really', 'nailed', 'Bilbo', 'character', 'manner', 'really', 'made', 'see', 'similarities', 'character', 'older', 'version', 'played', 'Ian', 'Holme', 'Armitage', 'played', 'very', 'heroic', 'Thorin', 'had', ""n't"", 'actually', 'liked', 'Thorin', 'character', 'saw', 'off-page', 'screen', 'writers', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'best', 'bits', 'character', 'bring', 'light.The', 'graphics', 'were', 'little', 'less', 'par', 'mostly', 'screamed', 'CG', 'opposed', 'LOTR', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'cool', 'fellbeasts', 'wargs', 'Why', 'did', 'change', 'warg', 'design', 'were', 'already', 'so', 'terrifying', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Gollum', 'was', 'great', 'lighting', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'fantasy', 'lover', 'Tolkein', 'fan', 'understand', 'comepletely', 'loved', 'book', 'reason', 'not', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'hiliarious', 'touching', 'hear', 'Tolkein', 'words', 'spoken', 'Bilbo', 'Gandalf', 'dialogue', 'Riddles', 'Dark', 'Every', 'person', 'owned', 'character', 'moments.My', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'Contract', 'Scene', 'loved', 'how', 'seemingly', 'unrealistic', 'part', 'book', 'was', 'used', 'humorous', 'way', 'Riddles', 'Dark', 'Scene', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'Thorin', 'charge', 'down', 'burning', 'tree', 'awesome', 'dwarves', 'theme', 'Misty', 'Mountains', 'was', 'terrific', 'was', 'credit', 'song', 'Song', 'Lonely', 'Mountain', 'echoed', 'dwarves', 'pride', 'hope', 'vengeance.I', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'Hobbit', '2']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449358,A3ODENXA668OR,B0059XTU1S,Markus Rexon,"[3, 4]","I'm pretty sure that its hard for anybody not to like this. So, this review probably won't matter much to anyone (probably since there are, like, 3,500+ reviews on this move, so this review will probably get overlooked), but I'd still like to say a few things on how good this movie is.First, I really like how close to the book it is. Sure, there is allot of dialogue added, and a few scenes that are added on to the original ones, but for the most part, the plot itself is pretty faithful to the book. I've seen allot of movies made off books that are just so messed up because they're, like, %95 different from the original book, and most of the scenes added are just plain stupid. But they don't do this here. Just goes to show how committed the makers of LOTR were carful to make this one just as good and pure as there previous LOTR trilogy. And for any scenes that were added on that weren't original, they're just as good as if they came from the original book.Second, the characters are REALLY well developed and personalized. For example, in the original book, allot of the 13 dwarfs are only used one or two times, and it doesn't go into allot of detail about allot of them. But in the movie, they make each dwarf unique, and each one has there own memorable specialty that would make Tolkien proud. Its easier to connect with the characters in a story when you know each one well and are able to start caring for them. Tolkien wasn't able to do all of that, since he had so many characters to deal with in his story, but this movie shows the characters in full colors, showing there personality, special look and so forth. You can actually have a favorite dwarf in the movie, when in the book you didn't know each one will enough to decide.And third, the movie itself is just really good. It seems like this days, all the movie producers will just take the cheap way out and do all there filming in the studio, but not in this movie. The previous producers of LOTR lived up to the legend of the previous Middle-Earth trilogy, making this movie a real, grand spectacle among allot of other movies made today. The wilderness scenes look so real, beautiful and captivating, and all the structures, buildings and such look very real. The clothing isn't done with cheap, very fake-looking material, but done with professional patterns that really fit into that world. The props used, such as weapons, hats, plates and other stuff also look quite real. And that's hard to do, as this movie was shot at a frame rate of 48 frames per second, making all the details really stand out. That means that they hade to pay extra attention to the detail of the sets, props and all the other aspects of the film. Really makes you appreciate more the work of its producers. And it does look fantastic.So, with that said, it looks like this is a very great movie. Call it what you want; you may just not like it for the story, the characters, or anything like that. But you must gives high starts for its production; and I don't see how anybody could not like the story. I'm pretty sure that pretty much everybody has seen this move, so everybody should have there own opinion; but I hope that this review helps add on to your opinions and helps shape them more.

1449359,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B0059XTU1S,MarlowesMom,"[6, 10]","This is a review of the film as a self-contained work for people who are not Lord of the Rings buffs. If you don't fall into that category, I invite you to stop reading now. Almost 40 years ago I read ""The Hobbit and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" with middling interest, then bogged down somewhere in the first third of ""The Two Towers."" I realize these books are near-sacred texts for many and apologize for not sharing your enthusiasm. I don't mind if you vote my review unhelpful if it fails to do what I intend, which is review the movie on its own, but please don't vote it unhelpful because I don't bring to bear your level of expertise on the books. (Also, I have not seen any of the LOTR trilogy movies.) I was willing to see ""The Hobbit"" because my kid wanted to go and I had become a fan of director Peter Jackson based on ""Heavenly Creatures.""Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman as a young man; Ian Holm as an old man), a Hobbit who likes his quiet, orderly life in The Shire of Middle Earth, is recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to accompany a group of Dwarfs on their quest to recapture their treasure-filled home in the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Along the way to the mountain, guided for much of the journey by Gandalf, the Dwarfs and Bilbo battle various monsters and dark forces and receive help from the Dwarfs' historic enemies the Elves. ""The Hobbit"" is a bit slow in the beginning, but about a third of the way through, the pace picks up, draws the viewers into the action and leaves us in awe of the fllm's craftsmanship in creating one spectacular action sequence after another.The costumes, makeup, sets and special effects are wonderful throughout. If you suffer from vertigo, be careful. A number of highly convincing scenes (even in flat-screen; I did not see the 3D) take place in narrow, high places. The acting is decent for the most part, especially veterans Ian McKellan and Ian Holm. Christopher Lee makes a stunning Saruman, the White Wizard whose wisdom Gandalf consults during the journey. The script has its share of bromides and stilted dialogue, especially in the beginning and in the sequences that take place in Rivendell, the home of the Elves, but it does the job of keeping comprehensible and clear a story with a large number of quirky-named characters, groups, places and objects. For example, Orcrist is the name of a sword, an Orc is a monster that attacks mounted on another monster called a Warg, Azog is an Orc war chief, Radagast is a wizard, Thorin is a Dwarf king, Moria is a Dwarf kingdom, etc. You can see where this could get confusing for the uninitiated.Overall, I found ""The Hobbit"" entertaining and beautifully made, enough so that I will watch the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

I was certainly curious what new footage would be added to what was already a somewhat embellished (some less kind people may even say bloated) version of the tale of The Hobbit... The additions actually worked quite nicely. The addition of the Goblin Town song was worth the proverbial price of admission, alone!I haven't listened to the commentary track, but I look forward to it. It is a bit disappointing to only have one track, as I enjoyed the each of four that were on the various extended LOTR films... but I won't hold that against this release. I will enjoy what we do have rather then lament what I wish we could have had.What I have done is gotten part way through the appendices. I'm three hours into the roughly nine hours worth of documentary footage. This is what I was most looking forward to on this release, and most worried might not live up to my expectations.What were those expectations? Well, when it came to The Lord of the Rings, the excellent behind the scenes material within the appendices wove a tale that was, in my opinion, just as compelling as that within the narrative of the films. I felt like I got to know not only the usual suspects of the actors and the director, but many of the other usually invisible people who worked on the film. I felt like I was taken along on the journey with them. I became emotionally invested in their tale. I felt genuine sadness as the filming of The Return of the King came to the end, and everyone started saying goodbye to each other... I felt as if I was saying goodbye to them, as well. It had just the same, if not greater, emotional impact as within the film itself when Frodo was saying goodbye to Sam as he was preparing to pass into the west...This was a lot to live up to. Would the behind the scenes tale of The Hobbit be able to recapture that magic? Well, I am only three hours in, about a third of the way into what will theoretically be only a third of the final tale once the last part of The Hobbit comes out... And I am pleased to say that it looks like the magic has been recaptured. I feel like I am seeing old friends once again, and meeting new friends along with them. I feel like I am reliving fond memories and forming new ones.Their tale can still tug at me.

I was getting really worried before going to see it because of some negative reviews, but there is nothing to worry about. If you loved the Lord of the Rings movies, especially the extended editions, then you will love The Hobbit too!A little bit about me: I grew up on the animated movies, read the books when I was in sixth grade, and have reread them several times over the years. I'm a HUGE fan, but not a ""purist"", and saw each of the live action films several times in the theaters. I took a class on Tolkien in college (and knew more about the books than even the teacher lol), went to view the original manuscripts at Marquette University in Milwaukee twice, and borrowed most of the History of Middle Earth books from the library but just skimmed them. I'm pretty familiar with much of the appendices/deleted chapters/abandoned attempts at revising The Hobbit and sequelizing Lord of the Rings, etc.I've been waiting for The Hobbit since 2003, and have been following the production online. When it was announced 5 months ago that Peter Jackson was splitting the story into 3 films (after already completing production on the 2-film adaptation), my heart sank. It's not that I was opposed to turning The Hobbit into a trilogy (despite that it's meant to be a children's story and not an epic), but I just didn't think there was enough story and it seemed like a cash grab that would probably destroy the pacing. But, Peter Jackson hasn't let me down before and so I held out hope. In fact the more I heard him talk about giving the dwarves a bit more character development and backstory and adding in all the stuff about the White Council, I began to look forward to it.When a couple weeks ago reviews starting coming in saying that, as I had first feared, the movie dragged and the pacing was terrible, I prepared myself for disappointment. Even though hardcore fans on messageboards like theonering.net who had seen the movie early kept saying it was terrific, the negative reviews from professional critics kept coming in. The movie is ""bloated"" and ""dull"" and ""misses the point"", they said. And so I was VERY nervous going to see the movie this afternoon.I'm pleased to say that not only is the movie incredible, but it's on par with the Lord of the Rings movies. I haven't felt this way about a movie since Fellowship of the Ring 10 years ago. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it all night, and I can't wait till I can go see it again. I sat in the theater for nearly three hours with the biggest grin on my face the entire time. The movie didn't feel bloated or stretched thin to me. I was worried that there would be all these scenes that went on too long or belonged on the cutting room floor, but I can't think of anything I would have left out. It was like watching the book acted out on the screen in front of me with really great acting, music, and production values.The cinematography has really improved in the last 10 years! Wow this movie is beautifully shot! Howard Shore's music is once again great, though there are some little deletions and changes from the Original Soundtrack -- the only one that really bugged me though was the use of the Nazgul theme over Thorin fighting Azog. There was better music there in the Original Soundtrack and changing it was a horrible decision.I love the added stuff with the White Council/Necromancer. It's all there in Tolkien's appendices and in ""Unfinished Tales"", and (blasphemy for saying so) depending on how this continues to play out over the next two movies I may end up liking this even better than the book! Either the next film or the one after that will have the Battle of Dol Goldur and, from what I've heard, we will see Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel battling werewolves and giant spiders as they try to drive out the Necromancer. I can just imagine how awesome that will be if Peter Jackson pulls it off!And, yes, this felt to me like a complete movie. One of the reasons I originally hated the idea of a trilogy was I expected to feel short changed by only seeing a small fraction of the story and then having to wait another year. But I felt like there was plenty of story and they got into plenty of adventures.My only nitpicks are few: I liked the design of the Great Goblin but I thought he acted way too cartoony. My other is there were a couple times where Bilbo and the dwarves fell from a height of like 500 feet and just got back up. They would have been killed. I also thought the character Azog was fine, but why did he have to be all CGI? Why couldn't it have been an actor in makeup like Lurtz in Fellowship of the Ring? Those are really my only nitpicks though.As I sat in the theater I had a feeling like this is one of the best filmgoing experiences I've ever had. I had the same feeling watching Lord of the Rings. As someone who originally hated the idea of making this into a trilogy, now I say bring it on!!!UPDATE: I got to see the movie in 48 frames per second (HFR 3D) yesterday. I had only seen it in regular 24fps 3D before. 24fps has been the standard for film since the Silent movie days. The Hobbit is the first movie to be shot at 48fps to give it a sharper look. Unfortunately the technology is new so only a few theaters are equipped to even show it at 48fps. Many of the reviewers were saying they hated it, that it looks like a BBC TV movie. I was still curious to give it a try because it's new technology and it's how Peter Jackson intended you to see the movie, but I didn't want it to distract from my first viewing if I ended up not liking it, so we saw the movie first at 24fps 3D.Anyway, I liked it and I didn't think it looked ""cheap"" or like a ""soap opera"" at all. It looked really sharp and there were some parts where the people looked like they were really right in front of you.

1449381,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B0059XTU1S,"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews""","[1, 5]","Wow.  And I don't mean to bore you with details, so I won't.  But there's a lot of ground to cover.First, some context.  Believe it or not, I never read or was read ""The Hobbit"", though I own it on audiobook (but I keep falling asleep while it's playing).  I also never bothered to watch any of the ""Star Wars"" movies (no, none of them).  Therefore, I have no comparison point to the book or Jar Jar Binks which everyone else seems to want to throw this under.  I did watch the extended editions of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and I will do some comparatives there.For those that don't know the book, this has actually little to do with the book itself.  In fact, while it shares the name and the basic premise, there is a lot of fluff thrown in for 'good' measure.  It is important that you approach this movie the way I did: It is essentially a prologue to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a device to help explain what happened before the ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  While the book is supposed to be the same, there were a lot of missing elements in the story due to J.R. Tolkien not living long enough to get everything tied up.  His son tried, but this movie is really the first time we see the puzzle pieces fitting together.  The end result is rather confusing, so try best to follow along.The movie begins with a voiceover from Bilbo Baggins, who is writing what will eventually be ""There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale"", seen at the end of the ""Return of the King"".  What he is speaking is found in the letter that he has left for Frodo at the end of his adventure.  It then goes to the now infamous starting line from the book: ""In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit..."" and the whole first few sentences.  It then goes to a brief conversation between Bilbo and Frodo (yes, Elijah Wood).  This culminates into a first meeting with Gandalf, and the dwarves who are embarking on an adventure.I had a number of problems with how this started.  It felt like Jackson was trying desperately to match what was said in the book - down to the corny diatribe from Gandalf to Bilbo - even though none of it matched the character.  Yet, the full duration of the movie is full with blatant attempts to be a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"".  As such one would expect somewhat clear personality similarities, especially with Gandalf, that simply aren't there in the first parts of the movie.  Secondly, while I wasn't as upset with the dwarf-at-hobbit-hole scene as other reviewers, I had tons of questions.  Why are they not questioning their being sent there?  Why are they simply trusting of Gandalf that this hobbit is the right person?  And why was Bilbo so eager to join the squad?  Again, from what little I recall from the story, Bilbo is constantly reluctant to go on the adventure the entire time.  Yet in the movie this is brushed off as just a brief hesitation.Once the real adventure begins, the movie starts a sharp divergence from the story.  It still keeps certain elements but there are many others that were simply patched in from other Tolkien stories such as ""The Silmarillion"" and ""Unfinished Tales"".  For example, there isn't a serious session with Saruman and Galadriel with Agent Lord Elrond, with Saruman chewing Gandalf out for making the party (BTW, when Elrond said ""purpose"", he WAS Agent Smith.  Poor Hugo).  There's no epic battle with Albino orcs.  The list goes on and on, and clearly the intent is to maintain the same level of majesty found in the trilogy, so it's understandable why fans of the book might be miffed at some of what's thrown in, nevermind exposing certain characters that were never in ""The Hobbit"" to begin with (aka Frodo and others).The remainder of the movie is wrought with the same amount of orchestral marching scenes panning gorgeous landscapes in New Zealand as are found in the trilogy.  Thinking of this movie in a different angle, you might not expect this since the book itself is quite short and not the epic adventure that the movie portrays it to be; this is precisely why I say that you must set aside that expectation before approaching the movie.  Seen as simply a prequel to the trilogy, everything makes perfect sense and obviously that's how Jackson saw the endeavor.  He wasn't trying to turn the book literally into the movie (though the first 30 minutes would convince you otherwise).Much has been made of Radagast the Brown.  Turned from a couple of colorful sentences in the book to a larger-than-life character, Radagast's parts could easily have been excluded entirely.  He adds nothing to the story except finding a certain sword that is shown to Saruman (and thus dismissed as unverified).  I didn't have as much issue with how the character was presented with bird droppings in his beard and down the side of his face; indeed, most book-to-movie attempts result in the exact same (see ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Disney as a perfect example).  As with the aforementioned, if the target is to appeal to the children that read the book rather than the child that is now an adult watching the movie, sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.Regarding the Blu-ray...my TV, an Insignia that I got about 3 years ago at a really good deal, has the ability to closely emulate the 48fps that the movie was presented at in theaters; just not in 3D (I hate 3D).  So I was able to experience the ""speed"" of things that people were talking about.  The best way I can describe it would be like a play, or a live action event where you are watching things right there on set while they're filming it. It didn't bug me too much since Back to the Future Blu-ray did the same thing at times, but where it got weird is any scene that was filmed with obvious fake props.  The most notable I saw was a scene where they panned over a landscape that was obviously not real; fake trees stuck into fake grass rather than a real area.  Also, when Gandalf is talking to Galadriel, the pillars to her left and right were too fake looking.  Gandalf himself, it was just seeing Ian McKellen in makeup all the time, unlike the trilogy where he blended into the character so well.  Overall, the quality was so clear and clean that you were easily able to see such imperfections and it took you out of the movie, combined with this new filming speed.If I had to name my biggest complaints, it would be the fight scenes; every last one of them.  They're all the same: party gets stuck into some sort of impossible situation with enemies twice or larger their size.  Even with so many dwarves they still manage to get beat down and either tied up, incapacitated, or stuck.  In every situation except one, Bilbo is the one that saves them.  This is stark opposite of the trilogy where Frodo didn't do hardly anything.  In fact Frodo was more of a coward than Bilbo in the movie even though the book has Bilbo being less willing to chip in and save the day.Then there is the introduction of Bilbo to Gollum.  A lot of people applaud this as the best scene in the movie, but frankly it was nothing special.  The Gollum character was played well, and the creepy mannerisms are something to behold, but the scene itself was quite unremarkable.Frankly, it was not a bad movie nor was it too long.  I didn't get the same sense of overall fulfillment from it that I got from Fellowship, nor did I gain much from the Bilbo character here.  Bilbo in the trilogy was a lot more entertaining overall, and ""The Hobbit"" at times felt mislabeled; as though it should have been called ""The Dwarven Quest"" because they dominated the screenplay almost exclusively.  This might have been in response to complaints about Frodo and Sam dominating the trilogy; I'm not sure.  In any case, as long as you don't bring book bias the movie is worth a watch.  But don't expect it to blow you away.  It's a decent movie, not a great one.If you buy the Blu-ray be sure to opt for the triple set with 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD.  It was 2 bucks more than the non-3D version.  If you do get a 3D TV in the future then you'll already be set.  I wouldn't worry about the extended edition unless you're so fan clouded you must have it, but I felt the movie was quite long enough.",3,Your bias must be set aside.

The movie was bad. Almost everyone who eventually went to see The Hobbit went in spite of the critics and those wretched reviews. As I watch the blu-ray version of The Hobbit for the third time, I can't help asking anyone who'll listen: what on Earth were the critics watching? What movie did they see and we missed? The Hobbit is a bit more detailed than LOTR, that is true. I think Peter Jackson was responding to those lovers of Tolkien's books who missed some of the whimsy, some of the poetry, some of the songs found in Tolkien that was left out of the three LOTR films out of necessity. So Jackson gives us some of the songs and whimsy and the critics (most of whom have never read any of Tolkien's books) complain. The Hobbit is a brilliant and exciting film. The two follow-up films promise to be even better as they conclude The Hobbit story and begin Sauron's rise in Mirkwood as The Necromancer.

1449400,A16ITYYOPBBP2R,B0059XTU1S,Michael D. MCKinney,"[8, 13]","I was (overall) happy with TLOTR and suspected due to its popularity that they would give us a live version of the hobbit. As a Tolkien/Jackson fan I was ready to spend more money and enjoy &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. Then I began to hear rumors that it was going to be another trilogy and I thought there was 'no way' they could stretch this book into three movies. When I read about how they were going to do it (pulling other material from other sources to 'fill in the blanks'), I began to get nervous.This book is not about Smaug, 'the hobbit', not about Gandalf, 'the hobbit', not about the Necromancer, 'the hobbit', not about Thorin, 'the hobbit', not about anything else but THE HOBBIT. The ring is such a very small part of this story that its amazing TLOTR was written at all! All of you who remember the book also remember that there is NO part of the book that doesn't involve Bilbo. We don't witness the death of Smaug, we're only TOLD about it when Bard tells Bilbo that the thrush delivered his message. We don't witness the battle of five armies because Bilbo in unconscious during the battle.There is so much material about Middle Earth that WB could have probably given us another 6+ movies in a &#34;tales from middle earth&#34; type format. There was no need to try and smash all these other stories under this one title.The movie slashes from one story to another and its confusing even to those of us familiar with the background events they have added to this adventure. The characters themselves are so different from the book that if different names had been used I doubt we would even recognize them.The (mostly) amazing CGI work done in TLOTR makes this product seem childish by comparison. The wholly ridiculous ride on the stone giants knee (ah 3D doesn't make it any better), the dumb looking trolls and Goblin (orc) King. Along with the Disney type escape on the rail cart from the goblin (orc) tunnels. &#60;-another part NOT in the book because while they are escaping BILBO is dealing with Gollum. Another small add to that, NOW according to the Jackson/WB version of the tale, Bilbo really did steal the Ring!! In the book he &#34;finds it&#34;, in TLOTR he &#34;finds it&#34;, only to realize later that the ring was Gollums. In this version he WATCHes the Ring fall out of Gollums pocket and STEALS it.Another major fault to this movie is how obvious it was rushed to the Big screen. Say what you want about the LOTR release, no one can say the battle scenes small and large were not spectacular. In this movie you wonder whether any battle choreography was done at all! From the battle with the trolls to the tunnel escape we have our adventurers swinging their axes and swords this way and that with no reason (until CGI &#34;THROWS&#34; an orc into the picture to receive the blow, or the Troll says ouch and then continues on as if nothing happens).I have mentioned only a couple of items where our WB/Jackson team totally ignore the original tale. If I were to write about all of them this review would be just as long as this very bad rendition of Tolkien's &#34;CLASSIC&#34;!! CLASSIC!! Guys!! This is a CLASSIC! How DARE you think you can do a better job of presenting this story than Tolkien! I always understand and have no problem with 'editing' and changing the story a bit to bring a classic to the big screen. But way to many of your changes were unnecessary and RUIN the story. And I mean RUIN it.I truly believe if Tolkien were alive today, he would have enjoyed TLOTR release. He would have understood the changes that were made as the tale was brought to the screen. And just as sure as I am that he would have liked TLOTR, I am just as sure that he would NOT have like what they have done to this book. In almost every case the was just no NEED to change the story as much as they have.If you really love &#34;The Hobbit&#34;, I suggest you watch the animated 'made for TV' version from the 70's.

Tolkien novel, you're expecting the wrong thing, especially since this is the first installment of what will become a trilogy.  One critic complained that too much of the first portion of the movie was spent at Bilbo's house.  My counter to that is that this installment is laying the groundwork for subsequent films, and that the first 45 minutes or so are designed to establish motive, characters, and the basic framework of the plot.In Peter Jackson fashion, this movie is full of sweeping panoramic scenes of the incredible New Zealand lanscapes.  On Blu-Ray, the crispness, clarity, and sharpness of the picture almost makes you feel as if you are there.  The acting is top-notch, Martin Freeman is delightful as Bilbo, Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf and is excellent, as usual.  Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield, is terrific in his portrayal of the Dwarven king.  Special effects (especially the motion-capture effects of Gollum and Azog the orc) are wonderful, leaps and bounds above The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Howard Shore's musical score carries over many of the motifs set forth in The Lord of the Rings, but additional compositions of original motifs make the score every bit as rich and sweeping as his previous work.For the Tolkien fan, I recommend this movie highly, and I cannot wait for the second installment to hit theaters.",5,"Ignore the negative reviews, this movie is excellent.",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1497,"['headline', 'states', 'best', 'ignore', 'negative', 'reviews', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'fast-moving', 'movie', 'based', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'novel', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'wrong', 'thing', 'especially', 'first', 'installment', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'trilogy', 'One', 'critic', 'complained', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'spent', 'Bilbo', 'house', 'counter', 'installment', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'subsequent', 'films', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'designed', 'establish', 'motive', 'characters', 'basic', 'framework', 'plot.In', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'fashion', 'movie', 'full', 'sweeping', 'panoramic', 'scenes', 'incredible', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Blu-Ray', 'crispness', 'clarity', 'sharpness', 'picture', 'almost', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'delightful', 'Bilbo', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'role', 'Gandalf', 'excellent', 'usual', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'who', 'Thorin', 'Oakenshield', 'terrific', 'portrayal', 'Dwarven', 'king', 'Special', 'effects', 'especially', 'motion-capture', 'effects', 'Gollum', 'Azog', 'orc', 'are', 'wonderful', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'musical', 'score', 'many', 'motifs', 'set', 'forth', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'additional', 'compositions', 'original', 'motifs', 'make', 'score', 'bit', 'rich', 'sweeping', 'previous', 'work.For', 'Tolkien', 'fan', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'second', 'installment', 'hit', 'theaters']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
1449405,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0059XTU1S,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[7, 11]","So finally, we have the film that should have come out first.  Like so many readers, I was introduced to The Lord of the Rings by way of The Hobbit.  But when I finally read The Lord of the Rings it was a real shock - the multiple plot threads, factions, names, territories, languages, etc. made it difficult for me to follow.  With The Hobbit I had a simple point of view, a character I could relate to, and a variety of monsters and wizards that were alternately amusing and terrifying.  It's ironic then, that where ""The Lord of the Rings'"" depth made it fertile ground for a movie, ""The Hobbit's"" simplicity makes it more of a challenge to translate onto the big screen.Part of the problem is simply that ""The Hobbit"" movie came after ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Although the characters are similar, they are not the same - the imposing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) we knew from the trilogy is a pipe-smoking goofball here who winces when his boss Saruman (Christopher Lee) appears.  Saruman is less imperious and more cranky; Elrond (Hugo weaving) more talkative and less imperious; and the dwarves are transformed from dour warriors to brawling roustabouts. This isn't necessarily out of sync with the spirit of the book - it's just that ""The Hobbit"" was written for a different audience, before the One Ring became more than just Gollum's (Andy Serkis) precious.There are numerous attempts to integrate ""The Hobbit"" into ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that feel forced.  The rise of the Necromancer (Sauron) is grafted on to Radagast the Brown's (Sylvester McCoy) appearance, who is such a bizarre character that he feels like he invaded ""The Hobbit"" from another film.  And that film is Peter Jackson's repertoire of other films.  It's easy to forget that Jackson was a producer for ""Bad Taste"" and ""The Frighteners.""  Jackson is now unfettered and can do pretty much whatever he wants, and if that means he wants to put a character with bird poop on his head riding a bunny sleigh, then by golly that's what he's gonna do! For fans accustomed the stentorian tone of the trilogy, Radagast will be quite a shock.Still, Jackson on a bad day is still head-and-shoulders above many other filmmakers, and his attention to detail will thrill fans of the series that are just happy just to revisit Middle-Earth. Sure, the monsters talk more, but their pedigree from the trilogy is evident in their flawless animation. There's enough goblins, orcs, and trolls to fill a Dungeons & Dragons dungeon.Gollum is the bright light here. It's clear Smaug is being saved for another film, the dwarves are too numerous to flesh them out as characters, and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is just finding his furry footing. But the surprises that made ""The Hobbit"" so memorable have all been spoiled by the series that would come afterward: the ring's powers, Gollum's appearance, the magic tricks Gandalf pulls (turns out you just have to whisper to moths to summon eagles).  As so many fans have asked of the Star Wars series...would the movie franchise make sense if it was watched in chronological order?  Should it?The answer, unfortunately, is moot - ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy came first, and all ""The Hobbit"" can do, like Bilbo, is struggle to keep up.",4,Bilbo struggles to keep up,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,3238,"['So', 'finally', 'have', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'first', 'so', 'many', 'readers', 'was', 'introduced', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'way', 'Hobbit', 'when', 'finally', 'read', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'real', 'shock', 'multiple', 'plot', 'threads', 'factions', 'names', 'territories', 'languages', 'etc', 'made', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Hobbit', 'had', 'simple', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'could', 'relate', 'variety', 'monsters', 'wizards', 'were', 'alternately', 'amusing', 'terrifying', 'ironic', 'then', 'where', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'depth', 'made', 'fertile', 'ground', 'movie', 'Hobbit', 'simplicity', 'more', 'challenge', 'translate', 'big', 'screen.Part', 'problem', 'simply', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'came', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'characters', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'imposing', 'Gandalf', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'knew', 'trilogy', 'pipe-smoking', 'goofball', 'here', 'who', 'when', 'boss', 'Saruman', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Saruman', 'less', 'imperious', 'more', 'cranky', 'Elrond', 'Hugo', 'weaving', 'more', 'talkative', 'less', 'imperious', 'dwarves', 'are', 'transformed', 'dour', 'warriors', 'brawling', 'roustabouts', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'sync', 'spirit', 'book', 'just', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'written', 'different', 'audience', 'One', 'Ring', 'became', 'more', 'just', 'Gollum', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'are', 'numerous', 'attempts', 'integrate', 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'feel', 'forced', 'rise', 'Necromancer', 'Sauron', 'grafted', 'Radagast', 'Brown', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'appearance', 'who', 'bizarre', 'character', 'invaded', 'Hobbit', 'film', 'film', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'repertoire', 'other', 'films', 'easy', 'forget', 'Jackson', 'was', 'producer', 'Bad', 'Taste', 'Frighteners', 'Jackson', 'now', 'unfettered', 'can', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'put', 'character', 'bird', 'poop', 'head', 'riding', 'bunny', 'sleigh', 'then', 'golly', 'what', 'gon', 'do', 'fans', 'accustomed', 'stentorian', 'tone', 'trilogy', 'Radagast', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'shock.Still', 'Jackson', 'bad', 'day', 'still', 'head-and-shoulders', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'attention', 'detail', 'will', 'thrill', 'fans', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'happy', 'just', 'revisit', 'Middle-Earth', 'Sure', 'monsters', 'talk', 'more', 'pedigree', 'trilogy', 'evident', 'flawless', 'animation', 'enough', 'goblins', 'orcs', 'trolls', 'fill', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'dungeon.Gollum', 'bright', 'light', 'here', 'clear', 'Smaug', 'being', 'saved', 'film', 'dwarves', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'Bilbo', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'just', 'finding', 'furry', 'footing', 'surprises', 'made', 'Hobbit', 'so', 'memorable', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'series', 'would', 'come', 'afterward', 'ring', 'powers', 'Gollum', 'appearance', 'magic', 'Gandalf', 'pulls', 'out', 'just', 'have', 'whisper', 'moths', 'summon', 'eagles', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'asked', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'would', 'movie', 'franchise', 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'watched', 'chronological', 'order', 'Should', 'answer', 'unfortunately', 'moot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'came', 'first', 'Hobbit', 'can', 'do', 'like', 'Bilbo', 'struggle', 'keep', 'up']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449428,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0059XTU1S,Mike S.,"[1, 2]","The extended edition is very much in the same vein of how the Lord of The Rings extended edition blu rays were done. The big difference being the movie is only on one disc instead of being spread between two discs. I am not sure what the theatrical edition of the movie had for a run time, but the extended edition clocks in at just over 3hrs (10 min or so of which are credits).Like Lord of the Rings, they are splitting the book up into 3 movies. This tells the story up to the orc battle in the woods before the group gets back to the Dwarven city, where of course the dragon awaits. The beginning of the movie starts out somewhat slowly, but does bring back Elijah Wood and Ian Holm to reprise their roles in sort of a lead up to Frodo meeting Gandalf in Fellowship. Then the movie flashes back to the events of The Hobbit, with Martin Freeman doing a wonderful job in the role of Bilbo.While the main story revolves around Bilbo and the Dwarves, we do get to see some of the characters from the LOTR films throughout the movie. The three main sequences in the film for me were the escape from the Goblins, the battle with the Orcs toward the very end of the film, and Bilbo's encounter with Gollum where of course the Ring is found. There is, of course much more than that in the movie, but those were the standout moments to me.The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. If you do get the extended edition, like with the LOTR discs, there are two appendices discs which have about 9 hrs of bonus material spread pretty evenly between them. The one drawback to those is that the discs are not set up to allow you to stop and pick up where you left off. So you either have to watch all 4 plus hours of material straight through, or watch each section one-by-one. It is a relatively minor issue, but could be a pain for those who do like to go through the bonus materialBasically, .like the LOTR extended editions, this is pretty much for hardcore fans. If you are lukewarm to the movie or just kind of a casual fan there is not really a big reason to shell out the extra money for these.

If you thought Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" was perfection, you won't like this one either. Peter Jackson and his fellow writers have str-et-ch-ed J.R.R. Tolkien's fine adventure story into three installments. The first, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, as is the next one. It's boring, exhibits poor storytelling skills, and is dominated by lots of nonsensical action scenes. Jackson & Co. have introduced a new villain into the plot in order to get more action scenes. Mostly, this results in incoherence, but there are more action scenes.The story begins with two prologues, as an elderly Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) records in his journal a brief history of the fall of the prosperous city of Dale, populated by men, and of the dwarf kingdom of Erebor, whose fortress city was inside the Lonely Mountain, where the dwarves mined gold and gems. Both were lost to the dragon Smaug, who devastated Dale and scattered the dwarves so that he might have their treasure. In the second prologue, Bilbo and his nephew Frodo await some guests, as Bilbo recalls his youthful adventures. Now the story begins: When Bilbo (Martin Freeman) was but a conventional hobbit youth, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) arrived on his doorstep, along with 13 other uninvited guests, the kingdom-less King Thorin (Richard Armitage) of the dwarves among them, to persuade Bilbo to undertake a journey to reclaim Erebor from Smaug.But encounters with Smaug are somewhere in the future. Rumors are swirling of a dark power in the form of a Necromancer, but we don't see him either. The villain in this installment is a white orc named Azog (Manu Bennett), who is hunting the band of adventurers, seeking revenge on Thorin. Who knew orcs were so independent-minded? I started to regret the CGI here. The wargs that Azog uses to track the dwarves seem pretty silly after a while, as you might expect of giant computer-generated canines. The orcs look too similar to goblins, which closely resemble trolls, so that's confusing. But most of this movie is filler: background information, endless scenes in which Gandalf tries to convince Bilbo to join the adventure party, more background, scenes that serve no purpose in the plot, humor that isn't funny, punctuated by action scenes.I haven't read ""The Hobbit"" in a long time, but I don't recall there being so many dei ex machina. Gandalf always rescues everyone. Action scenes seem to begin for little reason and end for reasons just as weak. Many characters appear in ""An Expected Journey"" who were not in Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", such as the elvin Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), the hobo-like wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy). The writers have done everything they can to extend the film by creating complications and subplots, but this undermines the basic adventure story and leaves the audience confounded as to what is going on.

1449438,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B0059XTU1S,mitchell5954,"[2, 2]","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey I find to be a decent film but rather padded.  When I heard that they were going to turn the Hobbit book into three movies I was rather skeptical.  Lord of The Rings was three novels so a trilogy made sense.  However, The Hobbit is only one book and is shorter than any of the LOTR novels.  If they separated it into two films like the final Harry Potter book it would have been fine, but a trilogy seems like a stretch.  They are going to be great changes, additions, and a great deal extended and padded.  This film feels very padded and seems like filler in many parts.The film introduces the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), and the dwarves he will be traveling with including their leader and rightful king Thorin (Richard Armitage).  Gandalf (Ian McKellen) also returns as the leader of the expedition.  Ages ago the dwarves&#8217; homeland Erebor was taken over by a dragon named Smaug.  Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and the rest of the dwarves head for Erebor to take back their land while being hunted by Oarks, Goblins, and other dangers they encounter.There are many things the film has going for it.  The acting is great from everybody.  Martin Freeman does an excellent job as Bilbo.  I can totally believe that he is a younger Ian Holm from LOTR.  Ian McKellen is awesome as usual.  He still plays Gandalf flawlessly.  Richard Armitage is also great.  Thorin is probably the first truly kickass dwarf we have had in all of the movies so far.  Gimli had some badass moments but he was the comic relief most of the time in LOTR.  The other actors do a good job as well.  The effects are amazing as always.  Peter Jackson movies always have great effects.  The action, when there is action is pretty fun and exciting for the most part.However, much of this movie feels like filler like I said earlier.  The first part is introducing and reintroducing us to the characters and establishing each character&#8217;s personality.  It is also devoted to explain the plot and mission.  The middle portion is just them walking from place to place while encountering a little danger here and there.  The LOTR films had a lot of walking to but it had more going on.  This film I felt did not have enough going on until the final act.  The action is not as exciting as LOTR either.  It feels more watered-down and lighter in tone.  It makes sense because the Hobbit was a lighter book than LOTR but it still did not get involved as much.  The action scenes in the goblin cave and the final action scene I thought were well-done though.I also did not think the characters were as strong here.  I liked nearly every character in LOTR while here I only liked two.  Gandalf and Thorin were great but the rest I thought were pretty bland.  Freeman does a good job acting wise but I could not get into Bilbo&#8217;s character until the very end when he stops being so cowardly.  The rest of the dwarves are very forgettable.Overall, the film is okay.  It is a decent introduction to the trilogy.  The acting is spot-on, the effects are great, and a few of the action scenes are fun.  The problem is that it is mostly setup and not much more.  It is definitely not as exciting as Fellowship of the Ring.",3,A Decent Introduction!,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3232,"['Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'find', 'be', 'decent', 'film', 'rather', 'padded', 'When', 'heard', 'were', 'going', 'turn', 'Hobbit', 'book', 'three', 'movies', 'was', 'rather', 'skeptical', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'three', 'novels', 'so', 'trilogy', 'made', 'sense', 'However', 'Hobbit', 'only', 'one', 'book', 'shorter', 'LOTR', 'novels', 'separated', 'two', 'films', 'final', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'trilogy', 'stretch', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'changes', 'additions', 'great', 'deal', 'extended', 'padded', 'film', 'very', 'padded', 'like', 'filler', 'many', 'parts.The', 'film', 'hobbit', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'dwarves', 'will', 'be', 'traveling', 'including', 'leader', 'rightful', 'king', 'Thorin', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Gandalf', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'also', 'leader', 'expedition', 'Ages', 'dwarves', '8217', 'Erebor', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'dragon', 'named', 'Smaug', 'Bilbo', 'Gandalf', 'Thorin', 'rest', 'dwarves', 'head', 'Erebor', 'take', 'back', 'land', 'being', 'hunted', 'Oarks', 'Goblins', 'other', 'dangers', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'going', 'acting', 'great', 'everybody', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'job', 'Bilbo', 'can', 'totally', 'believe', 'younger', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'LOTR', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'awesome', 'usual', 'still', 'Gandalf', 'flawlessly', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'also', 'great', 'Thorin', 'probably', 'first', 'truly', 'kickass', 'dwarf', 'have', 'had', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'Gimli', 'had', 'badass', 'moments', 'was', 'comic', 'relief', 'most', 'time', 'LOTR', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'always', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'always', 'have', 'great', 'effects', 'action', 'when', 'action', 'pretty', 'fun', 'exciting', 'most', 'part.However', 'much', 'movie', 'filler', 'said', 'earlier', 'first', 'part', 'introducing', 'reintroducing', 'characters', 'establishing', 'character', '8217', 's', 'personality', 'also', 'devoted', 'explain', 'plot', 'mission', 'middle', 'portion', 'just', 'walking', 'place', 'place', 'encountering', 'little', 'danger', 'here', 'there', 'LOTR', 'films', 'had', 'lot', 'walking', 'had', 'more', 'going', 'film', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'going', 'final', 'act', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'LOTR', 'either', 'more', 'watered-down', 'lighter', 'tone', 'sense', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'lighter', 'book', 'LOTR', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'scenes', 'goblin', 'cave', 'final', 'action', 'scene', 'thought', 'were', 'well-done', 'though.I', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'here', 'liked', 'nearly', 'character', 'LOTR', 'here', 'only', 'liked', 'two', 'Gandalf', 'Thorin', 'were', 'great', 'rest', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'bland', 'Freeman', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'wise', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'Bilbo', '8217', 's', 'character', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'being', 'so', 'cowardly', 'rest', 'dwarves', 'are', 'very', 'forgettable.Overall', 'film', 'okay', 'decent', 'introduction', 'trilogy', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'problem', 'mostly', 'setup', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'Fellowship', 'Ring']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Ultimately after sifting through the critical reviews I found that most of the gripes were with the way Peter Jackson shot the film in 48p as opposed to the standard 24p.  The effect that creates is very soap opera looking, for those who leave motionflow on with their televisions they will not notice a thing.  Personally I hate motionflow and have it disabled on my set, thus resulting in a much more natural and filmlike effect when compared to on which I feel makes it look like video.  Personally do not understand how that changes the film as a whole or why some reviewers felt compelled to bash it for that.As far as the movie goes, it is not perfect by any means...but I feel that I can safely say to any LOTR fans that they should enjoy this flick.  I have already watched it twice and expect to watch it a few more times.  Picture quality is outstanding and the surround is equally impressive.

1449448,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B0059XTU1S,M. Mierendorf,"[3, 6]","The Hobbit has been on the minds of fans ever since we heard The Lord of the Rings would be made into films first. It's actually a very ambitious story to translate to film when you consider the book's intended demographic of children; whereas The Lord of the Rings was definitively a story for adults. However, director Peter Jackson seems to have a very clear idea of how to balance The Hobbit.The Hobbit seemed like a long time coming but it was well worth the wait. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is long. However it doesn't seem bloated. Despite a slower pace than the LOTR trilogy, it feels calmer and more deliberate. Utilizing an expanded story thanks to the Appendices, Unfinished Tales and Silmarillion, the characters and story feel more flushed out and not rushed. Yes there are changes from the book, (introducing an enemy for Thorin), but they don't ruin the movie. The pacing is refreshing. It gives the audience adequate breathing room between our action sequences and story development. While some may find the scenes with Radagast and Rivendell overly long, they actually work to successfully bridge The Hobbit to The Fellowship of the Ring just as intended. Whatever complaints I may have about the film are minimal when shown against the ultimate canvas of the finished product.The film is also wonderfully acted - particularly by Martin Freeman (Bilbo). It's whimsical, lighthearted and relaxed. It still has the emotional impact and tension at the right moments, something Jackson has gotten better at in each film. As expected, Sir Ian McKellan also gives a great performance as Gandalf the Grey. The mysterious yet playful Gandalf from The Fellowship of the Ring is back, but as equally suspicious of the growing doom of Middle-Earth. Additionally, the Riddles in the Dark scene was perfect and absolutely how I imagined it as a kid when I read the book. Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Freeman have wonderful chemistry and it provides another layer to the complexity of Gollum/ Smeagol.As for the High Frame Rate and visual aspect of the film, it's remarkable. At first it is a bit jarring. It seems almost too real and in that sense fake, but you then lose yourself and remember that life in fact actually looks like that! The Hobbit is crisp, bright and clean. Yes, there are times that the CGI seems a bit fake, but when the rest of the film is as beautiful, you don't give it a second notice. The 3D is used to expand the film visually and very rarely for sight gag and thanks to HFR is smooth and you forget it actually is 3D. It was an immense joy to watch. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking. Echoing the travel scenes from Fellowship, The Hobbit also gives us glorious wide shots of the early journey and the HFR and 3D give it unimaginable scope.The film seems inevitable to divide people on the HFR vs standard 24 frames/ second, but Jackson may indeed have begun the change to a new cinema experience. Change is unsettling and people are inherently resistant to it, but when its all said and done, this is absolutely a film to see in the theaters; and more importantly one to be seen in HFR if you're lucky enough to have a theater projecting it in that format as Jackson intended it to be seen.Verdict: See In Theaters![...]",4,`The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' HFR 3D Review: A Beautiful Start to an Adventure,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,3264,"['Hobbit', 'been', 'minds', 'fans', 'ever', 'heard', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'films', 'first', 'actually', 'very', 'ambitious', 'story', 'translate', 'film', 'when', 'consider', 'book', 'intended', 'demographic', 'children', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'definitively', 'story', 'adults', 'However', 'director', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'have', 'very', 'clear', 'idea', 'how', 'balance', 'Hobbit.The', 'Hobbit', 'seemed', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'long', 'However', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bloated', 'slower', 'pace', 'LOTR', 'trilogy', 'calmer', 'more', 'deliberate', 'Utilizing', 'expanded', 'story', 'thanks', 'Appendices', 'Unfinished', 'Tales', 'Silmarillion', 'characters', 'story', 'feel', 'more', 'flushed', 'out', 'not', 'rushed', 'are', 'changes', 'book', 'introducing', 'enemy', 'Thorin', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'pacing', 'refreshing', 'audience', 'adequate', 'breathing', 'room', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'development', 'may', 'find', 'scenes', 'Radagast', 'Rivendell', 'overly', 'long', 'actually', 'work', 'successfully', 'bridge', 'Hobbit', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'just', 'as', 'intended', 'complaints', 'may', 'have', 'film', 'are', 'minimal', 'when', 'shown', 'ultimate', 'canvas', 'finished', 'product.The', 'film', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'particularly', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Bilbo', 'whimsical', 'lighthearted', 'relaxed', 'still', 'emotional', 'impact', 'tension', 'right', 'moments', 'something', 'Jackson', 'gotten', 'better', 'film', 'expected', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'Gandalf', 'Grey', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'playful', 'Gandalf', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'back', 'equally', 'suspicious', 'growing', 'doom', 'Middle-Earth', 'Additionally', 'Riddles', 'Dark', 'scene', 'was', 'perfect', 'absolutely', 'how', 'imagined', 'kid', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Gollum', 'Freeman', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'layer', 'complexity', 'Gollum/', 'Smeagol.As', 'High', 'Frame', 'Rate', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'remarkable', 'first', 'bit', 'jarring', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'sense', 'fake', 'then', 'lose', 'remember', 'life', 'fact', 'actually', 'Hobbit', 'crisp', 'bright', 'clean', 'Yes', 'are', 'times', 'CGI', 'bit', 'fake', 'when', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'beautiful', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'second', 'notice', '3D', 'used', 'expand', 'film', 'visually', 'very', 'rarely', 'sight', 'gag', 'thanks', 'HFR', 'smooth', 'forget', 'actually', '3D', 'was', 'immense', 'joy', 'watch', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'Echoing', 'travel', 'scenes', 'Fellowship', 'Hobbit', 'also', 'glorious', 'wide', 'shots', 'early', 'journey', 'HFR', '3D', 'give', 'unimaginable', 'scope.The', 'film', 'inevitable', 'divide', 'people', 'HFR', 'vs', 'standard', '24', 'frames/', 'second', 'Jackson', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'begun', 'change', 'new', 'cinema', 'experience', 'Change', 'unsettling', 'people', 'are', 'inherently', 'resistant', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'absolutely', 'film', 'see', 'theaters', 'more', 'importantly', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'HFR', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'theater', 'projecting', 'format', 'Jackson', 'intended', 'be', 'seen.Verdict', 'See', 'Theaters', '[', ']']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Martin Freeman blew a painful stab into the core of an artistic play with his annoying facial expressions, annoying body motion, and long and boring appearances in many empty scenes. Among the most inconvenient long scenes came near the end in a  play of a riddle with a skinned creature, in the grooves of the cave.The entire plot sounded like a child's narration, revolving in circles, from one episode of violence, followed by quite events yet to enter the next episode of violence, with no apparent goal other than the confusion of the moviemaker about the way to cram the movie with action animations, unconnected by any engaging causation.Starting from Hobbit in his old age with is his son, writing a fictional dream, supposedly fascinating in imagination, followed by time travel 60 years to young Hobbit. As the premise of fascination unfolds, the fiction revolves on mountain beats, witches, past monarchs, and legendary societies. There was no apparent valuable lesson to be learned.Martin Freeman (Hobbit) left the viewer with the inescapable feeling of being fooled with an actor fascinated by self grandiosity, dressed in contemporary man's clothing with intermingling with fictional characters.Taken individually,each scene and each work of art conveyed great sense of mastery and intrigue, all lost to poor planning of flow of events or staging purposeful climaxes.The many glorious animations of palaces, caves, gold treasures, and natural scenes, were all wasted with the improper flow of episodes of waring, invasion, and exotic mountainous scenes.

1449452,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0059XTU1S,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","I can't say that was all that excited to see this prequel of sorts to the great ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I had this pang in my gut fearing this would be something on the order of George Lucas restarting the ""Star Wars"" trilogy with the silly ""Phantom Menace"" in 1999. Fear assuaged for the most part.This preamble begins when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) decides to write the story of how he originally took possession of the infamous ring. His narration leads us back to his younger self (excellent Martin Freeman) who is inexplicably recruited by the wizard Gandalf (returning Ian McKellen). Their story is relatively simple. They are to help the 13 survivors of the dwarf kingdom, now led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in recapturing their mountain home held by a vicious dragon.The movie is about their journey getting there. Naturally there are enemies in their way, real and imagined. Not the least of which is an army of orcs and their giant wolf-like steeds. Scary to look at, the orcs are easily picked off inside their secluded compound by the dwarfs. I couldn't figure that one out. The orcs also have the ability to find dwarfs using a keen sense of smell...well except when they climb up in a tree. Another head-scratcher.Director, writer and head honcho of all things Tolkien, Jackson has the look down pat. Although I must admit, some of the backdrops looked a little too CGI. Perhaps the film had slowed to a point where I was just a bit too focused elsewhere. The film does seem to ponder at times. There is one scene when Bilbo falls down a jagged crevice in the orcs mountainous home (unscathed by the way) and first meets Gollum (the great Andy Serkis).Sensing everyone has been waiting for Gollum to appear, Jackson lingers forever in this confrontation. Bilbo and Gollum go through several rounds of verbal riddles, slowing everything down. Was the 2 hour and 46 minute running time really necessary? I don't think so. Several characters from the ""Rings"" make brief appearances including Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Elijah Wood as Frodo. ""The Hobbit"" will likely please many and irate others. I'm reasonably satisfied but hope for better things to follow.I originally watched this movie on an IMAX screen in 3D so didn't see the controversial faster speed film shown in standard theaters. As is usually the case the IMAX print looks great. The 3D isn't over done and has a natural look with plenty of depth.The Blu ray has 2D or 3D options and a variety of packaging.  All come with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The visuals are excellent especially the 2D version.  The audio likewise is first rate.  The English language version has a great DTS-HD Master audio 7.1 option.  French, Spanish and Portuguese are Dolby Digital 5.1.",4,3 1/2 stars for another Peter Jackson led J. R. R.

1449489,A3SQYXZEI7BAO4,B0059XTU1S,Nathan A. Foy,"[2, 5]","It has been 17 years since I have read the book &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221; so to do a comparison to the book is next to impossible so I will go with what I have seen from the movie itself.  I saw the 3-D version, which is pretty good graphically, but I hate wearing glasses.  OK, onto the movie itself.  It started off as Bilbo narrating it to Frodo where he told the story of the dragon Smaug overthrowing the dwarven kingdom.  We even get to meet with Frodo at the beginning of the movie, likely the setting just before Frodo meets with Gandalf in the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring.  Once this introduction is done they take us right into the story of Bilbo 60 years prior.The story actually takes a while to get going and is slower paced in the beginning than The Fellowship of the Ring, perhaps because they are trying to extend one book into 3 movies whereas the Lord of the Rings was 3 books into 3 movies.  However, it does seem that they use some good humor to keep us entertained. In the beginning  the dwarfs basically intrude Bilbo&#8217;s home driving him crazy.  Humor is spread throughout the movie, I would say in slightly more quantities than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.Once the movie gets going it gets pretty action packed.  We actually get to see cave trolls have conversations and other beasts of Middle Earth that were not in Lord of the Rings are presented here, some pretty big and nasty ones.  We also get to meet one other quirky wizard who rides a sled pulled with super fast bunnies.If you liked the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you will like this even if you find the beginning slow at first.  It&#8217;s a very different story (although Bilbo&#8217;s finding of the ring is told here) but it is still based in J. R. R. Tolkien&#8217;s middle earth.  One of the meanings I derive from this story is that we all would like the simple life without challenges, but sometimes those challenges can come into our lives unexpectedly.  Sometimes it is better to face the challenge as Bilbo reluctantly did than to ignore the challenge.  The challenges we face in this life help to build character, which can have a positive effect on others around you, which was the case in the story of Bilbo.  I look forward to the second part of this Trilogy and am glad to see the return of having to look forward to a few Decembers of seeing some of the greatest fantasy movies ever.",5,I'm so glad they are coming out with these,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2400,"['been', '17', 'years', 'have', 'read', 'book', '8220', 'Hobbit', '8221', 'so', 'do', 'comparison', 'book', 'next', 'impossible', 'so', 'will', 'go', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'saw', '3-D', 'version', 'pretty', 'good', 'graphically', 'hate', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'OK', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'Bilbo', 'narrating', 'Frodo', 'where', 'told', 'story', 'dragon', 'Smaug', 'overthrowing', 'dwarven', 'kingdom', 'even', 'get', 'meet', 'Frodo', 'beginning', 'movie', 'likely', 'setting', 'just', 'before', 'Frodo', 'meets', 'Gandalf', 'beginning', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Once', 'introduction', 'done', 'take', 'right', 'story', 'Bilbo', '60', 'years', 'prior.The', 'story', 'actually', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'slower', 'paced', 'beginning', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'perhaps', 'are', 'trying', 'extend', 'one', 'book', '3', 'movies', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', '3', 'books', '3', 'movies', 'However', 'seem', 'use', 'good', 'humor', 'keep', 'entertained', 'beginning', 'dwarfs', 'basically', 'intrude', 'Bilbo', '8217', 'home', 'driving', 'crazy', 'Humor', 'spread', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'slightly', 'more', 'quantities', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy.Once', 'movie', 'going', 'pretty', 'action', 'packed', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'cave', 'trolls', 'have', 'conversations', 'other', 'beasts', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'were', 'not', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'pretty', 'big', 'nasty', 'ones', 'also', 'get', 'meet', 'one', 'other', 'quirky', 'wizard', 'who', 'sled', 'pulled', 'super', 'fast', 'bunnies.If', 'liked', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'find', 'beginning', 'slow', 'first', '8217', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'Bilbo', '8217', 's', 'finding', 'ring', 'told', 'here', 'still', 'based', 'J.', 'R.', 'R.', 'Tolkien', '8217', 'middle', 'earth', 'One', 'meanings', 'derive', 'story', 'would', 'like', 'simple', 'life', 'challenges', 'sometimes', 'challenges', 'can', 'come', 'lives', 'unexpectedly', 'Sometimes', 'better', 'face', 'challenge', 'Bilbo', 'reluctantly', 'did', 'ignore', 'challenge', 'challenges', 'face', 'life', 'help', 'build', 'character', 'can', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'others', 'was', 'case', 'story', 'Bilbo', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'part', 'Trilogy', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'return', 'having', 'look', 'forward', 'few', 'Decembers', 'seeing', 'greatest', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'ever']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449496,A286CZAI1M80R3,B0059XTU1S,Neoncloudff,"[9, 15]","The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest.  While it does stumble slightly in the beginning, the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year.  And while it does take some getting used to, the 48 FPS presentation (in 3D IMAX) is absolutely the best format to experience this journey.4.5/5It's been nearly a decade since we last entered Middle Earth as envisioned by Peter Jackson.  There's no denying that The Return of the King was going to be a hard act to follow.  So lets just get this straight right off the bat: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in 2003.  What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turns out to be is an unexpected, but necessary and welcome, change to Peter Jackson's landscape of Middle Earth.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey features a memorable cast, but the standout is no doubt Martin Freeman as Bilbo.  He completely nails Bilbo's character!  Armitage is also fantastic as Thorin, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is back again and still great.  The rest of the supporting cast is good, but only a handful of the dwarves get significant screen time.The technical wizardry is also of note, no doubt.  It's not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie, where the special effects are absolutely incredible.  The rest of the movie is absolutely stunning.  The battle of Erebor, the escape from the goblin stronghold, the fights with orcs; everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done.  In 48 FPS the action does take some getting used to (the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects. In the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects, making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real), but a good 30-45 minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal, and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular.  I can't stress enough that, once your senses have adapted, the 48 FPS visuals are unlike anything else.Howard Shore's original score is his bet yet for sure.  Every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure, but it's the new theme that is still playing through my head even now.  The first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you, but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine.  Original themes from TLOTR trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well.  Overall, It's Howard Shore's best work yet.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to Middle Earth.  It's subject material is much lighter, the action is much more sparse, and the character building is considerably different.  And in terms of being faithful to the beloved classic, aside from the added Radagast sub-plot and the added ""white orc"" (which made more sense from a cinematic adaptation standpoint, and a change that I prefer), The Hobbit is pretty faithful to the original story.  I will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out, the Goblin King looks like he was stripped out of a video game, and there are some inconsistencies here and there. So when it comes down to it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not perfect.  Far from it actually.  It won't win any awards.  It won't be favored among the critics.  There are some silly choices made, and it isn't the most tightly crafted piece of film.But I could care less.This movie is adventurous, exciting, funny, all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel.  The stunning special effects, great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip.  But what truly stands out is Peter Jackson's eye for adventure.  There just hasn't been a quality adventure movie in a long while.  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the perfect antidote.  It's big, epic filmmaking with a purpose: to tell a story (albeit the long winded way) that's grand in scale rooted deep within its characters.  Make time to see this movie, and go into it with excitement, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else: the wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is going to be incredibly painful.4.5/5 -

Clocking in at just under 3 hours, this film bears some semblance to the three LOTR films, but in other ways it is quite different.First the similarities.  They include a large ensemble cast with many key roles, distinct and unique personalities, and great dialogue from everyone.  There is also the awesome soundtrack, essentially a symphony for the movie with its melodies rooted in romance classicism.  The film also has two great choral pieces, one of which was also featured in the first movie trailer.  Then there is the beautiful make-up, costume design, set design, and incredible detail of the weaponry, animals, and other non-human characters.  And finally we have the awesome cinematography that shows the best of both New Zealand and of Peter Jackson's imagination in bringing Middle Earth to life.  As for the differences, there are few but they are key.  The first big difference is the mood of the film.  There is no romance in this film; distinctly different from the LOTR films which featured one or two key romances per film.  Instead of romance, we have more comedic action.  Whether it be the dwarfs cleaning up Bilbo's dishes, or fighting the trolls, or escaping from Goblin town, the action sequences in this film bear strong semblance to the many Chinese kung fu classics of Jackie Chan.  This is in strong contrast to the action scenes from the LOTR films, which are closer in feel to the grim, gritty fight scenes in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Possibly the biggest difference is the visual clarity of The Hobbit.  The 48 frames/minute clearly stood out when I saw this film in Digital 3-D.  On Blu-Ray 2-D, the visual clarity also stands out like no other Blu-Ray I have ever purchased.The only drawbacks to this package are twofold.  First, this is the theatrical version, with the extended version due out later this year.  Second, there are no previews of the next film, as that was only available online.

It's all done with an obsessive approach to every aspect of the story. Thus, character development is managed with care, but so too are matters like the design of mugs and the hemming on Bilbo's Bermuda sorts. It's all realer-than-real. And that's not a joke. Super high-def technology provides sceen views that work differently from normal human vision. In the real world, we focus with incredible sharpness on a center of interest, and the rest of the visual field is not resolved to that extent; things come into sharpest focus when we look at them. But in the Blu-Ray screen view, the whole wide screen is sharp, and while this is great on the second or eleventh view, because there are always new things to discover, for people who do lots of visual work, the first viewing is freaking weird, antiseptic, and far, far from believable. I don't recommend doing it, because it nearly ruins the movie, but it becomes easy to see the painted, stage-set effects of surface texture, or fabricated and CGI elements in so many scenes. It's gorgeous, and perhaps looks ""real"" to most people, but it sometimes reeks of Jar Jar Binks and the heavy-handed effects in the later Star Wars episodes. The other jarring element of the film, in my opinion, is the decision to treat many of the dwarves as caricatures. There's way too much ""Dopey"" in many of them, in my opinion, and while humor is essential to balance the other emotions of the story, I found this element to be heavy handed, unbelievable, and dumb.

His Hobbit severely disappointed me.The book is charming and whimsical. The movie is hectic, loud, full of unnecessary action scenes and creatures that either reminded me of other movies (for example, Jabba the Hut made an appearance, complete with cackling sidekick creature, in the form of the goblin king; or the white orc who looked like a cross between the creator-dude in Prometheus and the coughing skeletor-like general in one of the Star Wars prequels; or the trolls, which looked like bigger versions of Kreacher in Harry Potter) or that we had already seen in LotR (for example Gandalf calling the eagles by means of a moth).If you're like my brother and feel that the sense of traveling with the characters got lost in LotR - it is much, much worse in The Hobbit: One second Bilbo catches up with the dwarves, the next they're running away from wargs, the next they're in Rivendell... More time is spent on an idiotic underground battle with goblins (a sequence that looks like a combination of the Mines of Moria and the CGI-swoop through Saruman's forge in LotR) than on the journey from Hobbiton to Rivendell.Speaking of journey: In the book, the dwarves leave Bag End in a mess and Bilbo spends a good while cleaning and washing up and having a leisurely breakfast, glad that they're gone, and then Gandalf shows up and shoos him out the door. This scene is completely missing in the movie, so people unfamiliar with the book cannot possibly understand why Bilbo decides to follow Thorin & Co.Don't get me started on the character of Radagast and the subplot involving him. CGI slapstick! Other major eye-roll-inducing moments include the dying hedgehog, the sequence when the goblin king gets killed (""Oh, well, that'll do it."") and way too many scenes in which the characters would have been killed or at least injured, yet they get up and walk away without a scratch. Way too cartoonish.The riddle scene with Gollum (the most convincing CGI creature in the whole movie and - with the exception of Gandalf - the most accomplished and convincing actor) was fairly well done, albeit unnecessarily ""humorized"" (""I wasn't talking to you, was I?"").Overall the movie overloads Bilbo's tale with too much background story in its attempt to connect it to LotR. It seems quite obvious to me that Jackson and his crew consider this their last visit to Middle Earth, so they're packing as much into it as they possibly can - and then some.To sum it up: This is not The Hobbit, it's The Hollywobbit.",2,Jackson does The Hobbit - SPOILERS,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2580,"['S', 'P', 'O', 'L', 'E', 'R', 'W', 'A', 'R', 'N', 'N', 'G', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'LotR', 'trilogy', 'blew', 'away', 'Hobbit', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'me.The', 'book', 'charming', 'whimsical', 'movie', 'hectic', 'loud', 'full', 'unnecessary', 'action', 'scenes', 'creatures', 'reminded', 'other', 'movies', 'example', 'Jabba', 'Hut', 'made', 'appearance', 'complete', 'cackling', 'sidekick', 'creature', 'form', 'goblin', 'king', 'white', 'orc', 'who', 'looked', 'cross', 'creator-dude', 'Prometheus', 'coughing', 'skeletor-like', 'general', 'one', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trolls', 'looked', 'bigger', 'versions', 'Kreacher', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'LotR', 'example', 'Gandalf', 'calling', 'eagles', 'means', 'moth', '.If', ""'re"", 'brother', 'feel', 'sense', 'traveling', 'characters', 'got', 'lost', 'LotR', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'Hobbit', 'One', 'second', 'Bilbo', 'up', 'dwarves', 'next', ""'re"", 'running', 'away', 'wargs', 'next', ""'re"", 'Rivendell', 'More', 'time', 'spent', 'idiotic', 'underground', 'battle', 'goblins', 'sequence', 'combination', 'Mines', 'Moria', 'CGI-swoop', 'Saruman', 'forge', 'LotR', 'journey', 'Hobbiton', 'Rivendell.Speaking', 'journey', 'book', 'dwarves', 'leave', 'Bag', 'End', 'mess', 'Bilbo', 'good', 'cleaning', 'washing', 'up', 'having', 'leisurely', 'breakfast', 'glad', ""'re"", 'gone', 'then', 'Gandalf', 'up', 'shoos', 'out', 'door', 'scene', 'completely', 'missing', 'movie', 'so', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'understand', 'why', 'Bilbo', 'follow', 'Thorin', 'Co.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'character', 'Radagast', 'subplot', 'involving', 'CGI', 'slapstick', 'Other', 'major', 'eye-roll-inducing', 'moments', 'include', 'dying', 'hedgehog', 'sequence', 'when', 'goblin', 'king', 'killed', 'Oh', 'well', ""'ll"", 'do', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'least', 'injured', 'yet', 'get', 'up', 'walk', 'away', 'scratch', 'Way', 'too', 'cartoonish.The', 'riddle', 'scene', 'Gollum', 'most', 'convincing', 'CGI', 'creature', 'whole', 'movie', 'exception', 'Gandalf', 'most', 'accomplished', 'convincing', 'actor', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'unnecessarily', 'humorized', 'was', ""n't"", 'talking', 'was', '.Overall', 'movie', 'Bilbo', 'tale', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'attempt', 'connect', 'LotR', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Jackson', 'crew', 'consider', 'last', 'visit', 'Middle', 'Earth', ""'re"", 'packing', 'as', 'much', 'possibly', 'can', 'then', 'some.To', 'sum', 'up', 'not', 'Hobbit', 'Hollywobbit']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Once again, staying very true to Tolkien's vision, he has brought everything to life, sharing with us this adventure. Because I haven't seen the HFR version, I won't be talking about it, but the 3D worked relatively well!Many minutes of this film were focused on the Necromancer, and I think that degraded the experience somewhat. Here, we are given two great evils (Smaug and the Necromancer), and Jackson only delves into the Defiler to momentarily satisfy viewers, which is hard to do after this long wait. We'll simply have to appreciate the fleshed-out story world before our eyes, and scour the internet tirelessly for Cumberbatch's voicing of Smaug. Even a single word would do.What does satisfy dedicated fans is the attention to detail in the books, and for hardcore fans, the striking nostalgia of scenes re-imagined from the 1977 animated Hobbit film. One that comes to mind is Gollum paddling across the water.I have to admit, the battle scenes were once again incredible. Indeed, sometimes unbelievable. Near the end, the company seemed to have the luck of leprechauns. Everything happened conveniently, with no reason for it. Also, Gandalf suddenly uses powerful magic at the end. Why not use it before?Anyway, those qualms did little to sink the pride I felt for Jackson's accomplishment. Gollum was fantastic with his riddles and rhymes, and his selves were quite distinct this time, which was great to see. The dwarves were so much fun, but I wish I'd heard more of certain ones (such as Bombur). I love the energy they have with each other, it's very enjoyable to watch, especially their songs at the Shire.In conclusion, Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's story further to light, and with much skill. The characters were great, and I look forward to seeing some new ones in particular.

1449508,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0059XTU1S,Noelle Eiram,"[0, 1]","An Unexpected Journey is entertaining but bloated and frustratingly familiar.The story follows Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) years before his younger cousin Frodo's adventures in The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo's mentor, drops by one day to take Bilbo on an adventure. More than a dozen dwarves join them in an attempt to reclaim their treasure and homeland from a greedy dragon. Jackson doesn't just follow J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. He adds tidbits from other Tolkien books to flesh out the story.The film's ambiance is jarring, alternately somber and colorfully childish. The latter is the more endearing, mainly because it is more original. Many shots and scenes come across as a worn imitation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Action scenes are repetitive and confusing, while other scenes drag on. Cutting a good 45 minutes might have improved the pacing.That said, revisiting Tolkien's work is nostalgic. Its ominous tone, including a glimpse of the dark &#34;necromancer,&#34; foreshadows the increasing perils in The Lord of the Rings. The characters are charming. Bilbo is more mischievous and developed than the movie-version's saintly Frodo (Elijah Wood). (It is still nice to see Frodo again.) The dwarves, though stereotypes, including Richard Armitage's Thorin, are nicely acted and likable.There is something enjoyable about talking monsters. Their humor SLIGHTLY humanizes them. Unfortunately, a white, giant orc is given a very cheesy role as Thorin's nemesis. The film dwells far too long on how evil this creature is. We had three movies to discover how bad orcs are. I didn't find this plotline compelling.Perhaps the best scene of the film occurs between Bilbo and (SPOILER ALERT) Gollum (Andy Serkis). It is one of the most subtle moments in a loud, heavy-handed movie. The encounter between the former hobbit-like creature, a currently mad Gollum, and the inexperienced but crafty hobbit Bilbo is genuinely suspenseful.The cinematography and music are lovely, but all derivative. It feels more like a copy than an ode. The Hobbit could have been a truly resonant, enchanting movie instead of a trilogy. The makers could have distinguished this film from its predecessors. But the lure of gold, as Smaug the dragon would agree, is strong enough to justify one movie for the price of three.",3,3 1/2 stars - Enjoyable but uneven (not extended version),1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,2342,"['Unexpected', 'Journey', 'entertaining', 'bloated', 'frustratingly', 'familiar.The', 'story', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'years', 'younger', 'cousin', 'Frodo', 'adventures', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Gandalf', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Frodo', 'mentor', 'drops', 'one', 'day', 'take', 'Bilbo', 'adventure', 'More', 'dozen', 'dwarves', 'join', 'attempt', 'reclaim', 'treasure', 'homeland', 'greedy', 'dragon', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'just', 'follow', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'book', 'Hobbit', 'tidbits', 'other', 'Tolkien', 'books', 'flesh', 'out', 'story.The', 'film', 'ambiance', 'jarring', 'alternately', 'somber', 'colorfully', 'childish', 'latter', 'more', 'endearing', 'mainly', 'more', 'original', 'Many', 'shots', 'scenes', 'come', 'worn', 'imitation', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'repetitive', 'confusing', 'other', 'scenes', 'drag', 'Cutting', 'good', '45', 'minutes', 'might', 'have', 'improved', 'pacing.That', 'said', 'revisiting', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'nostalgic', 'ominous', 'tone', 'including', 'glimpse', 'dark', '34', 'necromancer', '34', 'increasing', 'perils', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'characters', 'are', 'charming', 'Bilbo', 'more', 'mischievous', 'developed', 'movie-version', 'saintly', 'Frodo', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'Frodo', 'again', 'dwarves', 'stereotypes', 'including', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Thorin', 'are', 'nicely', 'acted', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'talking', 'monsters', 'humor', 'SLIGHTLY', 'Unfortunately', 'white', 'giant', 'orc', 'given', 'very', 'cheesy', 'role', 'Thorin', 'nemesis', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'how', 'evil', 'creature', 'had', 'three', 'movies', 'discover', 'how', 'bad', 'orcs', 'are', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'plotline', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'Bilbo', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Gollum', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'one', 'most', 'subtle', 'moments', 'loud', 'heavy-handed', 'movie', 'encounter', 'former', 'hobbit-like', 'creature', 'currently', 'mad', 'Gollum', 'inexperienced', 'crafty', 'hobbit', 'Bilbo', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful.The', 'cinematography', 'music', 'are', 'lovely', 'derivative', 'more', 'copy', 'ode', 'Hobbit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'resonant', 'enchanting', 'movie', 'instead', 'trilogy', 'makers', 'could', 'have', 'distinguished', 'film', 'predecessors', 'lure', 'gold', 'Smaug', 'dragon', 'would', 'agree', 'strong', 'enough', 'justify', 'one', 'movie', 'price', 'three']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

When I first saw THE HOBBIT (in digital 48 frame per second projection), I did not understand the disappointment. I thought the film fully delivered. And the Extended Edition delivers even more. Without doubt, I can say that this will become the version I look to when I wish to screen the series. This film down not have as much new material as was added to the films in the first trilogy. Undoubtedly, Jackson has the confidence of the studios and can now create and deliver a &#34;Tolkien film&#34; of virtually whatever length he wants. There's no need to leave out a story line to save time. I can't imagine a studio executive getting nervous over Peter Jackson (and Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) working with this material. Consequently, there is less meat to pack onto the bones. What's there, though, is at least pleasing and at best thrilling. I never thought I'd get LOTR or THE HOBBIT on film with such care...or that the films would become such popular successes. My son (to whom I read &#34;Shelob's Lair&#34; at age 5) and I agree that this is a multi-million dollar fan project and everyone else can just come along for the ride. Thankfully, there are millions of fans.I have not yet completed the Appendices, but what I have viewed gives me full faith and confidence that Team Jackson is packing in detail far past the ordinary &#34;Making of...&#34; featurettes. The package also includes this little statue (little, hah!) of Gollum regarding Bilbo from above just before starting their game of Riddles in the Dark. It's lovely and worth the cost of the item entirely on its own. The video and audio (viewed on a 57&#34; DLP screen with 7.1 DTS-HD Master sound) is delightful.

Just have fun and don't take everything so seriously.  Very happy to have the 13 in almost ""book-form"".-More time in Rivendell.-The Great Goblin song and dance is back!The rest of the movie had bits and pieces of extra footage but not much to decsribe in any length here.To digress again, this movie is about entertainment.

Next I look for whether you get a stereo view or a true 3 - D effect and if you get at least some shots where it comes out of the screen and or brings you in with peripherals .

Part I covers the first third of the novel and definitely the magic is back. It wasn't easy I'm sure, the book is slim and leaves a lot unsaid. Jackson made a good choice in showing us the history of these dwarves, a Middle-Earth race that didn't get on screen in LOTR. He also brings to life the barely mentioned Radagast and the other creatures like the rock monsters. The big difficulty was to bring The Hobbit in line with the look of LOTR. Even in the books they are very different in many ways, even though Tolkien did make revisions to the Hobbit after LOTR was published to link them better. Really, most of the deviations from the book are still within the mythos. It is not to part 2 of the movie do we see the bulk of ""new"" additions such as adding Legolas to the story.

1449546,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B0059XTU1S,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[3, 6]","A little more than a year ago, I wrote a gag review on this film and posted it under the book title just as a subtly humorous attempt to keep Sir Peter straight which I am certain he never read. My prophecies generally all came true. Some features were good, some were bad, some are arguable, depending upon what one values in a film.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This movie is a fantasy-adventure, but not animated. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of The Shire, is recruited by Gandalf the Wizard to serve a dozen dwarfs as a ""burglar"" that they might journey to their former homeland on a great quest to reclaim the region as well as all the treasure which was seized by Smaug the Dragon. If you wish to see the ultimate battle, you'll have to stand by for about two years as this is only the first entry of two more films to come.The screenplay was extracted from J.R.R. Tolkien's fairy tale,*The Hobbit* which was initially published to massive popularity in 1937. Tolkien went on to publish *The Lord of the Rings*, (which was released as a trilogy in 1954-55), which picked up the Hobbit tale, (with a notably darker ambiance), and continued the story of Middle Earth.EVALUATIVE SUMMARY: One of the foremost failings with having the top people writing a screenplay, (in this case it was chiefly Director Sir Peter Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and family friend Philippa Boyens), is that there remains no objective person to influentially criticize the finished product. Even when others might offer useful and compelling opinions, the thoughts of these top people will always prevail. As a result, some nuances of this film do not benefit the overall work, (and in fact diminish it in terms of art), and this fact becomes blatantly evident to anyone who has considerable life experience with the foibles of people and their predictable behaviors.To be specific, the gifted Director Peter Jackson, teaming with the generally odious Hollywood moguls, clearly leaned much more heavily upon the profit-motivation aspect of this film, showing copiously less concern for the artfulness of the production which we witnessed with the earlier three *The Lord of the Rings* films. Up until the final moments, there were to be only TWO Hobbit films, (which was already twice the length required from my view.) That was apparently when the actuality hit them that they had inadvertently generated enough footage to stretch the financial proceeds even further by contriving *three* epic-length films and thus the dreaded announcement was issued with joyous enthusiasm.Here are the points which I find particularly objectionable regarding this film, (and no doubt to some unknown degree in the two anticipated films.)1. *The Hobbit* does not limit itself to the expected periodic comic relief - specifically, it bulges with low-brow one-liners and *The Three Stooges* -type slapstick undergraduate humor which the typical non-thinker savors so much these days. Most of these dubious witticisms manifest the additional flaw of being anachronistic in nature, detracting mightily from the script.2. The special effects, while quite professionally crafted, are unreservedly over-the-top and, at least for my tastes, reek of the diminutive Hollywood mentality. To put it bluntly, I seriously doubt that Professor Tolkien would have approved and I'll wager that even Peter Jackson, his eye on the paycheck, felt pangs of guilt.3. The inspired composer, Howard Shore, accepted a milk run on this one. Peter Jackson nearly annihilated him with unrelenting deadlines during the previous trilogy. I think Mr. Shore wised up in this instance and considered, ""People are going to make a *lot* of money on this film, people who will not be working their guts out as I did the last time around - so I'm not going to do it this time."" And he didn't. One could hardly blame him. Goodwill can only be stretched so far. Most of the music here is recycled work from the previous trilogy. Yes, I understand the need to link the films, leitmotifs, etc., but so much of the film-score is precisely the same product, note for note, and could have been manipulated just a little.4. As it was clearly going to be necessary to stretch this tiny fairy tale in order to achieve three epic-length films, the movie integrates a glut of Hollywood fluff, (likely brain-gas hatched from Boyens' head, a person who could rationalize the activities of Pol Pot), the misdeed having been perpetrated on quite a monumental scale. The writers inserted a dark underlying scheme, for example, which supports the prelude to Sauron of the previous trilogy. This theme gave rise to all manner of opportunities which simply do not appear in the source work. As for the exploitation of dramatic license in re-working how certain events of the original book actually transpired, some of these scenes were well-done and some are entirely tasteless. Any thinking person can instantly determine which are which.Lesser misadventures with this film are equally evident but, in the interest of brevity, not worth enumerating.Overall, I was entertained by the film and it was certainly worth the nineteen bucks I paid for it at Wal-Mart. I thought that Sylvester McCoy's performance as Radagast the Brown was terrific. The former *Doctor Who* outshone most of the others. I do feel compelled to note that Cate Blanchette's work was something short of mediocre but, if she failed, most of the blame falls upon the writers. She's no longer stunning enough to simply stand around and look like a fairy princess which is what appears to have been attempted. Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo Baggins was magnificent. His appearance, in regard to linking up with that of Ian Holm who plays the older Bilbo, was nothing short of sterling. So, Kudos to Peter Jackson on the overall casting.As I anticipated, the New Zealand landscapes were nothing short of astonishing and they added a remarkable ambiance to the movie. Peter Jackson demonstrates an imaginative eye for using just the right location for a shot. The costumes and make-up were pretty good, perhaps appearing just a bit dreadfully outlandish in the case of the dwarves. Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield doesn't look like a dwarf in any sense which is equally true of a couple of the younger dwarfs, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner); however, I did not view these three caveats as taking away from the film in any sense as their acting was largely first-rate, after accounting for dull-witted screenwriting.I don't wish to belabor any of the points I have introduced here. Some, (chiefly the young who attend the cinema with frequency), will see them quite differently. I come from a classic film and classic literature background so that is the basis for my views.A quick word on the second disc: You'll get two things, including the nine ""how we did it"" clips [blogs] which you can already watch for free on You Tube and, a somewhat commercial travelogue of New Zealand that only tenuously links to the making of the film. It's more of a tourism promotion but still informative and well-done. Somehow, one also gets an upload of the film to one's computer by entering a code which comes with the DVD. I don't know how to do this and will not bother but others might enjoy this feature.In summary, the movie is much darker and considerably more oriented toward adult views than the material of the original book, which was written for children. *The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey* is a fun and entertaining movie; however, it will definitely not withstand the test of time as will *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy of films which were all exponentially superior to this Peter Jackson entry.Highly recommended.",5,Flawed... but still worthy of 5 stars [quick details],1364342400,"03 27,

1449561,A8IZXBE7J6RNJ,B0059XTU1S,P. B. Pereira,"[78, 117]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I hated pretty much everything about this movie, but here are the main points:Expanding on Tolkien's mythology: Presumably, the reason you should ""never trust an Elf!"" (Gimli's line in TFotR) is because Elves turned their back on the Dwarfs when they were being attacked by Smaug? What were they expected to do against a dragon and why were they just standing there anyway? This is basically adding a whole new level of mythology. A no-no, unless it's an improvement and that's not the case here.The dwarfs: They looked ridiculous to me and their behavior was annoying. But no dwarf was more off-putting than Thorin with his ludicrous fur-trimmed leather duster, Rob Zombie do and constant glowering. Ugh.The introductory scene takes too long but, given all this time, you'd think Jackson would try and be more faithful to the book. But, no, he still manages to mangle it. Anyway, the next day, after Bilbo has decided not to go the day before (he wasn't really given the choice in the book), he just...goes. And it's very interesting that he's able to, on foot, overtake Gandalf and the dwarfs all riding along briskly on horseback. And when he does catch up, he's offered a pony, which he at first declines. Why? Bilbo had nothing against riding a pony.Azog: The footnote springs to cinematic life and has a vendetta against Thorin. The character in the LotR Appendix, for all of his two-pages of appearance and death at the hands of D&aacute;in, is still more bad-ass than the video game reject in AUJ. Anyway, if Jackson wanted to go this route, it would have made more sense to just go with Azog's son Bolg, who will appear anyway.Trolls: or, how to take an amusing sequence from the book and drain it of any humor whatsoever. Actually, that opinion that applies to the whole movie. But, instead of Gandalf employing ventriloquism on the trolls and getting them to fight each other, Bilbo tells them the dwarfs have parasites and Gandalf gets to break a rock in two. Yawn.Radagast: An utterly ridiculous and repellent visualization of another footnote character, with his ridiculous dying hedgehog, rabbit-drawn sleigh and poo-smeared face. But that's just my opinion. But why is he in the movie at all? To tell Gandalf about the Necromancer, I guess. But if Gandalf doesn't already know this (as he does in the book) where did he get the map and key from Thr&aacute;in (Thorin's father) who (in the book) was a prisoner in Dol Guldur? Presumably, he wasn't in Dol Guldur in the movie. So where is he? It's basically glossed over. In any case, the very idea that Greenwood is turning into Mirkwood right before Radagast's eyes at the start of the movie just strikes me as a desperate and weak attempt to create a sense of urgency and menace. The spiders are even seen entering the forest as if to take up their positions. Also in any case, Gandalf's very reason for being in Middle Earth is to help combat the Necromancer (aka Sauron). For him not to know about his presence in Mirkwood is, sorry, just witless.Apparent invulnerability: None of the protagonists get hurt in this movie. Stone giants fall on them, they get up. They fall a hundred feet, they just walk it off. Goblins (who, for some reason, are portrayed as distinct from orcs) attack in droves, they just cut them down like wheat. Thorin does later fall unconscious (from a blow that should have crushed his skull), but he later turns out none the worse for wear. Even if these characters weren't profoundly irritating, why should I care about them if they're not in any danger? And enough with the fake deaths. Did anyone watching this really fear the titular character might fall to his death halfway through his own movie?Riddles in the ""Dark"": Finally, some resemblance to the book, except even here there are details changed for no good reason. And couldn't they have toned down the lighting just a bit more to give some impression of darkness? As for Gollum himself, it's hard to find fault with Andy Serkis, except that Gollum is now basically a celebrity and practically played like one in the film. He no longer surprises, frightens or disturbs in the least. The cosy lighting doesn't help at all.Bilbo the Badass: Bilbo kills a Warg (which, though strong enough to uproot a tree, will drop with a single arrow or sword thrust/hack). Later he savagely kills an orc. Where'd this come from? Perhaps to make up for Frodo being a wuss in those other movies? Whatever the case, it's so far out of left field, it's just seems tacked on.Eagles: Gandalf just happens to spot a moth nearby in the tree he's climbed up to avoid the orcs and wargs. How convenient. And the book's explanation for the eagles doesn't work because...? There really is no good reason. Jackson wants to make full use of the eagles, but only as devices; he's averse to giving them any back story or personality or anything. You'd think with his apparent love of exposition and the characters making speeches all the time, something could have been said about them, but no, the eagles just drop them off and depart. They're nothing more than deus ex machina. Granted, there are challenges to following the book more closely here but I still think Jackson takes the cheap way out.Final scene: Bilbo blithely states ""I do believe the worst is behind us."" Really? Why would he believe this while looking at a mountain that is 1) still leagues distant; and 2) he knows contains a fire-breathing dragon?I will be surprised if even morbid curiosity compels me to watch any more of these.",1,An Unbearable Journey,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,5567,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***I', 'hated', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'movie', 'here',

1449575,A3VIHZUSNOGWFY,B0059XTU1S,Peter Olafson,"[68, 89]","This is barely The Hobbit. It's essentially The Lord of the Rings: The Prequel. Director Jackson's instincts, comparatively on the mark in the LotR trilogy (particularly in The Fellowship of the Ring), seem to have deserted him here.While in some respects the prototype for the later Lord, The Hobbit was a far more intimate, careful creation -- an epic but also a novel -- and the movie deserved its own distinctive vibe, its own pacing, its own production design.But it's been treated as a second-rate Lord of the Rings mash-up. Jackson has simply pushed The Hobbit down into the LotR mold, trimmed off the parts that over-ran the borders and added new LotR-style material where Tolkien did not supply it. (Hence, the Giant Combat Scenes and the Powerful Nemesis and the omission of any useful sense of the delights of Bag End.)Indeed, there's so much extraneous material that the story (originally as straightforward as can be) occasionally gets a bit lost. For instance, in the central section a fair chunk of time is invested in the wizard Radagast, but to no useful purpose beyond seeming inspiration for a ""Return of the Jedi"" speeder bike-type sequence in the inevitable video games.And Radagast has company. Jackson has needlessly freighted his movie with characters who never appeared in The Hobbit and one of the results is that, with less screen time (and few closeups), the core cast is harder to identify. If you're making a story with 13 dwarves, this is something at which you need to work assiduously. They should not be largely interchangeable -- and they are. (At the same time, a number of the dwarves barely seem like dwarves at all. Thorin Oakenshield in particular has been 'Aragorned' and wears a single disdainful look on his face throughout.)The director also hasn't edited himself tightly -- this theatrical edition runs an exhausting two hours and forty minutes -- and this is his first Tolkien movie to try my patience at a basic level.And even in the most basic terms, Jackson hasn't even made what I'd call a technically good movie. There's something distinctly and consistently ""off"" here. Too much of this feels as though it wasn't fully thought through -- as though Jackson didn't have time or inspiration or handed off critical issues of continuity and style to ADs or production assistants. But The Hobbit has none of the organic flow of the the LotR films, it's notably lacking in the artful audio-visual signposts that helped guide us through the trilogy and certain scenes are just botched. For instance, the one in which young Bilbo passes out under the pressure of too many uninvited guests is downright incompetent -- not well-acted or sweetly sad and certainly not funny. It plays as though Freeman either missed his cue or Jackson simply didn't have time to labor over the result. Similarly, Gandalf's appearance outside the hobbit hole's door and the trolls sequence, both so memorable in print, come across oddly half-baked in the reinvented versions here.And it's all just so uneventful! Even the climax seems trivial and underdone (and oddly overdone at the same time) and at one point I found myself almost laughing. I could point to the miscasting of Freeman in the title role -- even Elijah had greater gravity -- or the absence of the rich sense of foreboding that was so much a part of the novel or the issues some allege with the high frame rate, but I suspect it's a deeper issue: the pressure to turn this unitary tale into a trilogy and the resultant overtaxing of the source material. (A far more sensible scheme was laid out by the director back in the '90s, when he saw The Hobbit by itself as the first film in a trilogy with LotR filling in the last two slots.)This didn't need to be three movies.

I had some concerns with this, especially since they were going to force pushing this book out to 3 movies. This was a concern because the Lord of the Rings books were each progressively more complicated than the previous ones, and this book was very simple by comparison. Honestly as far as the books go, The Hobbit was really written more in the style and complexity of current ""teenager"" books. Not that this is a bad thing, it made the book very easy to read and still enjoyable. But to make a single movie of the more complicated books and 3 out of the lightest version of Tolkien's masterpieces seemed forced.I saw it on opening day in the theater and I was overjoyed. They added a separate story line (Two actually, and I won't go into details so no spoilers here) that is interesting and exciting to watch. These added story lines were not in the books at all - and as a LOTR purist I am surprised at how happy I was with them. It still very much has the feel of a Tolkien story and didn't take away from the rest of the story - in fact they managed to enhance parts of it with background and other information.As far as the quality of the actual physical product it is excellent there as well. I was very happy to see that there were subtitles - the original posting here did not include information about included subtitles. The sharpness of the Blu Ray came across very well, crystal clear production and transition to disk. The edition I purchased has 3D, BluRay and DVD formats together.For most of the other concerns of many people's reviews, they just don't bother me nearly as much. Especially with regards to an extended version likely to come out late in the year. I simply did not want to wait, and I'm glad that I didn't. I may still get the extended versions when they come out too, but that will be a game time decision. I may also just wait for the price to come down then, who knows. Right now I'm not worried about it at all - I got to watch this movie on my TV in my home the day it came out because I had it delivered that way - and if you were to tell me then that I should have waited I would have laughed at the idea of it.If you are a fan of the series and really want to own and watch this movie, get it now instead of waiting.

1449581,A1W45HIJSPH62I,B0059XTU1S,Philip J. Herman,"[1, 4]","Some thoughts on seeing the hobbit movieMy reviews are basically written for John and Greg , two old friends who are sensitive and artistic and sometimes like similar things to the things that I find interesting.The movie the Hobbit is nothing at all like the book the Hobbit.I always liked the book, the Hobbit, because when reading the book the reader can tell that Tolkien is realizing the story, creating the story in his mind, relating the story to his larger conceptual continuity as he is writing the story.The reader can also sense that the story begins more or less as a children's book with some interesting wordplay and cute characters, and only as it progresses through the middle and towards the ending does it become heavier and more adult.The movie the hobbit, overall, is a breath-taking rush with a few reflective moments and a few gems from the book.At first, I was disappointed as the hobbit movie started because it did not follow the book.  As the movie progressed I began to realize what was going on and I became absorbed into the story and started to enjoy it.The movie begins with Bilbo BAGGINS writing the story of the hobbit to give to Frodo. As Bilbo thinks about writing the story he briefly re- counts the history of the dwarves and the dragon taking away their treasure and their homeland then the story goes back 60 years earlier and begins the story again like the book the hobbit begins.All of this is a bit confusing and I was very glad when they finally got around to Gandalf coming to Bilbo's door, introducing himself and having the famous ""good morning "" conversation with Bilbo. The movie does not capture the cute funny situation that Tolkien wrote in the book. The dwarves do not look like the dwarves as I always imagined them to look they're not nearly as cute and then not nearly as funny and the whole situation of how the dwarves arrive at the door and hang up their cloaks and introduce themselves to a flummoxed BILBO in my opinion was not captured at all in the movie.Honestly, I think Peter Jackson could have captured the feeling of the beginning of the book much better.  I felt that at least as much energy was expanded but not the right tone was set.Even little things like how BILBO  wakes up the next morning and Gandalf reminds him that he's late and he runs off without his handkerchief did not have the same cute fun flavor of the book.  Moving along to the encounter with the three mountain trolls, again, although the trolls were amazing looking, a triumph of CGI, they were not funny like the original book was.  Lots of little interesting memorable parts of the story were rewritten for no apparent reason not to make it better but perhaps to make it flow visually more successfully who knows.And as usual with any blockbusters CGI movie today each and every single scene was overdone. Mountains fighting and dropping rocks on the little group was way over the top the floor of the cave opening up and the dwarves and Gandalf falling apparently miles down into the mountain into a timber constructed trap was way over the top somehow when you read the book you don't get the full impression of thousands and thousands and thousands of squirming wriggling hideous orcs as you see in the movie. The way that the orc king is finally killed is quite graphic and violent in fact all of the endless endless fighting as Gandalf and a group of dwarves try to escape is hideously violent much more so than my impression from the book.Parts of the story, the hobbit, are rewritten for the movie.  This is an interesting development.  Tolkien wrote the story the Hobbit before he fleshed out the story of the LordOfTheRings and before he fleshed out the Silmarilion which was written after the LOTR ( and tells the story of the dark lord before the story of the hobbit ) . What Peter Jackson has done is combined elements of the LOTR story with elements of the eventual prequel into this  movie story The Hobbit.  This is interesting but not necessarily enjoyable or desirable.For instance, Radagast The Brown is quite a major character in the hobbit movie I don't think he is even in the hobbit book but he is an interesting character and probably adds a lot to the enjoyment of the movie.I noticed in the credits that Benedict Cumberbatch plays the part of the NECROMANCER.  This is a little strange because in the movie than NECROMANCER is seen only as a fuzzy black shadow for a few seconds so there must be more of him to come in parts two and three.So, what we have basically is a retelling of the story of the hobbit with out the cuteness and with a lot of flashbacks and flash forwards and embellishments and retelling's and changes and with a lot of breakneck fast movement chase scenes and way over the top CGI.There are some beautiful  poignant poetic unforgettable insightful  SCENES in the movie the hobbit.When Gandalf speaks to Elrond and Galadriel and Saruman at the table outside of RivenDell it is great.When Bilbo confronts gollum on the shore of the lake under the mountain in the cave and they have their riddle game it is great, except that I could not understand everything that Gollum was saying which in effect destroys all enjoyment of the scene because the whole point of the scene that is to understand the  riddles.  But Gollum's acting is superb.The finding of the RING is different from the book, But, it flows nicely and  makes visual sense and is OK.  This special effect the special affect of how Bilbo sees things when he is wearing the RING and therefore invisible works perfectly visually on the screen and is totally successful.All in all, I would have been happier if the movie was cuter, more faithful to the book, and if the dwarves looked more like all of the dwarf illustrations we have seen for the last 50 years.I think it is nice that  SMAUG is not only hinted at but almost shown especially at the end of the movie where he is lying in his treasure trove under the mountain, buried in gold coins but waking up as if he has been disturbed because he senses that Thorin Oakenshield and the other dwarves are on their way.Some of the main themes of the movie are not clearly expressed because the people speaking them have either intense speech impediments because of makeup or they have accents or they have peculiar voices so what they're saying is not clear enough and therefore the themes are not expressed clearly.  I was a little disturbed by this.Again, all in all, this movie the hobbit is probably as good as we can expect.  As a fan and reader of the books I cannot really judge how this movie would impact someone who did not know the story from reading it or who had only seen the lord of the rings movies and now was interested in what happened before.This movie is visually overpowering, stunning, an amazing accomplishment, and very satisfying.So, upon awakening this morning, having slept after watching the hobbit movie, I realize that the parts of the movie that have been playing over and over in my head are a combination of parts from the book that weren't in the movie that I was reminded of by seeing the movie and some of the visuals in the movie that were in the book but not amazing in the book and some of the visuals that are in the movie which were not in the book at all.  For instance,For instance, I keep visualizing the multicolored cloaks hanging on the hooks in the hobbit hallway which is in the book but not in the movie.I keep visualizing Radagast The Brown who iswas not in the book at all.I keep seeing the amazing long involved convoluted escape of Gandalf and the dwarves from the underground caverns of the mountain orcs which, is in the book, but I never quite fleshed it out with visuals.I keep visualizing the scene where Bilbo has to leap over Gollum's head to escape through the gate on the back end of the mountain from the lair of the mountain orcs.  This scene is quite different in the movie, the movie combines the escape of Gandalf and dwarves with Bilbo's leaping through the doorway. In the book, these are separate occurrences and they meet up on the mountainside in the forest after.  In the movie, they are combined in a successful interesting way very satisfying.  I keep seeing the leader of the orcs who has white skin and it's terribly scarred one armed and large vicious,riding on a warg, a giant werewolf, ( to my knowledge. )  To my knowledge, he is not necessarily in the book in any way shape or form, but he is a major player in the hobbit movie part one.  Maybe he is necessary to focus our fear and apprehension in the movie.One of the other complicated, convoluted, and recreated up from multiple scenes, seems in the hobbit movie use again the discussion between Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman; which, in my memory, does not actually take place in the hobbit book but does help to establish the fact that the dark lord has returned to the forest and is gathering power and is called the NECROMANCER and the character of Saruman,even though he is considered to be the most powerful and knowledgeable white wizard and the leader of the group of which Gandalf is one.  SARUMAN comes across as being glib and thirsty for power and not completely honest so all in all I think that's a successful scene and necessary to tie together the three giant long involved Lord Of The Rings movies with this prequel.",4,actually more enjoyable than the LordOfTheRings trilogy,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,9379,"['thoughts', 'seeing', 'hobbit', 'movieMy', 'reviews', 'are',

I have to say that when I saw this film in the theatre, I was underwhelmed as compared to the previous LotR trilogy.  I felt Peter Jackson was over reaching in an attempt to make The Hobbit too much like the earlier movies, and I still maintain that it was an error to deviate so much so from the book.  It was just unnecessary to add a large, ogreish gray orc, Lurtz wannabe.  Having said that, I gave the movie a fresh look, knowing how much I was originally disappointed, and I have to say that it allowed me to appreciate its finer points to a far greater extent.  From the arrival of the dwarves and their mournful ode to the Misty Mountains, to the cave trolls, to the interplay between Bilbo and Gollum and their exchange of riddles, that each of them were truly masterful, and I have been finally wooed.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Extended Edition)(Blue-ray + UltraViolet)This is a review of this product and not the movie.  However, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Unlike the vast majority, I read the book after watching the movie several times on HBO in HD format.  Although, I appreciate and enjoyed each medium for the manner in which the story is presented  but I liked the movie better because I prefer action and, thus, I find most children books a wee bit boring.  J.R.R Tolkein was a genius and 99% of the time here Peter Jackson has indeed honored and reimagined his work incredibly well.This movie in blue-ray is beyond amazing and the sound is spectacular and New Zealand is the one and only ""Middle-Earth."".  I am totally hooked on this format. The picture is so clear and vivid that I felt like I could reach out and touch the actors or the scenery.  Some readers may say well duh!  However, in my defense, early on and sometime still the blue-ray version are not so amazingly better than the DVD version.  I will download the Ultraviolet version eventually but quite frankly if it would lower the price of blue-rays movies I could gladly do without it.  I chose to wait for the extended addition before purchasing this movie and I feel it was the most prudent choice.  The extended edition is available in DVD but for 2.79 difference I recommend buying the blue-ray version unless, of course, one doesn't have a blue-ray player.The reason I only give this purchase a 4.5 star rating is because I found the majority of the added scenes to be a bit disappointing.  Unlike the scenes in the LOTR's extended edition, the scenes here, IMO, didn't really reveal any additional information from the book, ""have any real story value"" ( to use PJ's words during the commentary) and/or add any real depth to the story/movie.  Nevertheless, as a consummate fan I was happy just to have more of the movie than is in the theatrical version.I highly recommend this product even to those who aren't ""die-hard"" fans of the movie.

1449608,AIJUXB9WUHYK1,B0059XTU1S,Quo Primum,"[30, 53]","I went to this movie with the greatest of hopes.  Our family has been the greatest Tolkien fans, and have admired all the books and the adaptation that Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  So with that in mind, and the positive attitude that we had going in to the movie, that fact that I am only giving it two stars should say alot.Jackson totally overplayed any action scenes and pushed reality to nonsense.  It would be simply impossible to fall hundreds of feet hitting rock sufaces and still survive, and yet these drwaves do this over and over.  Bridges perfectly swing to and fro to rescue them from danger in what could never happen in reality, heavy items (6000 pound troll?) seemingly do not crush them, and when Thorin is crushed in the jaws of a horrible warg/wolf, he doesn't die.  Of course.  The action scenes were so overwhelming and unbelievable they became boring.  Enough already.Jackson took so many liberties with the story line that it barely resembles the book.  The dialogues are entirely different - it is barely recognizable except for the names of the characters and the places they visit, such as the Shire, Rivendell (Imladris), the Lonley Mountain in the distance.  I felt that Jackson must have quite some superiority to think that he could make the story better than Tolkien, who is arguably one of the best story tellers of the last century.  Jackson, a little humility may have helped you make a better movie.Then there is the revolting aspect to the movie.  Yes, revolting.  Not content with the hideousness of the orcs and goblins in the last film, he had to make them even worse.  Since the goblin scenes make up such a huge portion of the movie, it was disgusting to look at these disfigured beings for hours.  The Pale Goblin, has a metal spear protruding through his arm as his ""prosthethic.""  So that wasn't gross enough?  In a B style movie maneuver, Jackson resorts to sophomorish ways to get laughter - you guessed it, SNOT.  A twenty foot long thread of snot ejected onto Bilbo.  For the rest of the movie (about half?) we get to see this become encrusted and dryed on Bilbo's clothing.  Still not suffienctly disgusted?  How about bird excrement running down Radagast's hair, face, and beard as a permanent adornment.  Tolkien depicted Radagast as a unique, solitary individual.  Jackson made him fit for an insane assylum.  Radagast is pulled around on a sled towed by obliging rabbits, whose combined weight would not equal the wizard's weight.  Despite this, these rabbits also had the ability to out run warg wolves.  Totally unrealistic.Jackson made the dwarves look ridiculous.  Other than three that looked presentable and rather swashbuckling, the rest had excessive and bizarre use of braids, one that coiled around his head looking like brains, one sported a hat that had exagerated points to each side.  I think Jackson would have gotten further with more moderation in their costumes.  He made them look buffoonish, ignorant, slovenly.  At the house of Elrond, they disparaged the food, and were utterly rude.While we are at the House of Elrond in Imladris, I want to point out that Hugo Weaving was one of the few charaters that made the movie tolerable, and unfortunately his parts are very brief.  He looks impressive, strong, and masculine riding in on a stunning horse.  In Rivendell, the book talks of great banqueting and even better storytelling and music.  None of that is shown in the movie, with only a brief scene with an elve playing an artificial harp in the background.  Well, I play harp, and that was bogus.  The elve is not really playing the harp at all, just strumming her fingers back and forth totally out of sinc with the harp music.  Stupid.  With great harp musicians like Loreena McKennit and Deborah Henson Conant, Jackson couldn't have found ONE person who could really play a harp in the House of Elrond?  He'll have thousands of little skulls built for a twenty second scene, but he can't find a real harp and a real harpist?  Please, Peter, we are not stupid!I am so glad this movie was rated PG-13 since there is some serious nightmare influencing material in it, and if you have smaller children I strongly recommend that you not take them.  While it is rated PG-13 I know that New Line is heavily marketing to the younger crowd.  Let's face it, how many teenages play with Legos, some but not alot, and they are heavily marketing toys like those for the 7 and up audience.I do not hold out any hope for the next two movies since so many liberties were already taken with the plot and characters in this one.  The grotesque elements are not worth enduring again.  We will not be going to the next two films when they come out.  I would rather preserve the images in my mind from the books, and not have Jackson's distorted depiction ruin it.",2,Major Disappointment,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,4849,"['went', 'movie',

I have to give the movie props for the cinematography. I mean, oh my goodness, the visuals are beautiful!! All of the images are so clear and crisp, I literally felt like I was right there with Bilbo. I especially love the Elf kingdom and the graphics for that are amazing. I can't even explain with words how beautiful the imagery and 3D are in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. There are a few things that bothered me about the visuals though. Some of it is almost too perfect and too clear. You can see every piece of grass in the field and every pore or drop of sweat on the dwarfs. It is a bit too much. The other thing that pulled me away from the movie is how the Orcs look. They look like video game characters and they don't have the same quality of the rest of the CGI in the film.My favorite character in The Hobbit is, by far, Gollum. Even though he is only in one scene of this movie, he is really funny in a creepy way. I really want to go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings just to see more of him! I also like Bilbo Baggins because everyone doubts him, but he never gives up or turns back. My favorite scene is a toss up between when Bilbo meets Gollum and when the dwarfs are in the underground world of the Goblins. I love when Bilbo meets Gollum because the two of them have a very funny interaction of riddling each other. I also like when the dwarfs are escaping the Goblins because their world is underground and very rickety.The biggest downside of this movie is the length. It is way too long in my opinion, but then again, all of the Lord of the Rings films have been very long. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings then you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but will I see it again? No. The cinematography deserves 5 out of 5 stars but, the overall film only gets 3.5 out of 5 from me. Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",4,Fantastic Visuals - Almost Too Perfect.

The original story line is not accurately followed and plenty of hollywood fantasy ""fill"" is added to stretch the movie to its current length.  As a result it has become a ""kiddie movie"" instead of the much darker but child friendly book.  As you watch the scene with the 3 trolls ask youself ""doesn't this remind me of the Three Stooges""? One troll even sounds like Curly Joe.  As a result, instead of the menacing trolls of the book you get a comedy routine. And by the way, the dwarves ""never fought the trolls in the book, they were captured and bagged by them."" The mountain goblin encounter is completely animated adding to the cartoon feel of the whole film.""Radagast the Brown"" is not even a part of the original book and is just another corny attempt at comedy that has been added to stretch the movie to feature length, and indeed, the original story into 3 movies when it could have easily been done in one, three hour film.  Regarding any ""extended version"" I will pass, as it is bound to offer more hollywood nonsense. Its a real shame that Peter Jackson sold out for the money that 3 below average films would generate verses just one great film.

Ian McKellan is again Gandolph and delivers another masterful performance; and Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo Baggins also performs masterfully. The Dwarves are new characters with new actors portraying them; but in addition to McKellan, you will see many familiar faces...Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis.

Though The Hobbit has a different feel than The Lord of The Rings, it seems to fit well with the other films. It has more of an innocent sense of adventure to it. The character of Bilbo helps greatly in this respect. He is a believable unwilling--yet tempted--adventurer.Gollum is another character who must deliver a realistic performance in order for us to accept that this story is reasonable and faithful to Tolkien's intent. His portrayal, a mix of animation and live action voice and movement, is easily believable. As in The Lord of The rings, his character is a solid blend of malice and pitiable existence. I felt both revolted by him and sad for him.Unfortunately, I was not impressed with what appears to be a significant amount of animation, especially with the character Azog. Perhaps I am wrong, but I feel that there was a fair amount of this film work in this movie. Perhaps there was more animation in The Lord of The Rings trilogy than I caught on to; this movie is not so subtle in that regard.All-in-all, this is a fun movie!

With LOTR already having set the bar soaringly high, it seemed as The Hobbit's first of three acts, this being &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; had no choice but to disappoint. And seemingly a 300 page book stretched to three movies is a bit of a stretch- in fact, the book's infamous opening line, &#34;In a hole in the ground, there once lived a hobbit...&#34; doesn't ring out of the speakers until exactly 9 minutes and 18 seconds into the movie. Thing is though, people have to realize that this isn't something epic... well, it is, in its own way. But it's the beginning of something epic, first and foremost. The Hobbit was always a simple tale, and while the simplicity is there in this first act, I can gladly say that the Hobbit deserves more put into it than perhaps people want to admit. As the great grey wizard himself says, &#34;All good stories deserve embellishment&#34;.I saw this film twice when it was in the cinemas- once at midnight in 48 FPS and again two nights later in IMAX 3D at 7 PM on a Saturday. While I loved it then, at the same time I needed to give it time to &#34;sink in&#34;, sort of. People fail to realize that as simple as Tolkien's masterpiece is, there's more to it than the books allow us to see. The appendices are full of material that add to both The Hobbit and LOTR, and I'm glad to see they brought some material into the film. One good example was how they handled Radagast The Brown- played by Sylvester McCoy, formerly of Doctor Who fame. His inclusion could have been a disaster, but the way they handled him, he fit in there comfortably, and his role in the story does a lot more than most realize.What really did it for me about this film though, other than what they included and excluded (because face it, it's a MOVIE, not a book. The book was great but it's time to hand in our brains and just try to enjoy the movie) is how they handled the story in terms of tone and technicality. The first half charmed me and was just plain cute. Sure it had the typical &#34;R-rated opening&#34; that the previous films had, but after that, when we get a glimpse into Bilbo's life and the introduction to the 13 elves, from there on it is as endearing as a beloved children's tale. Yet even then, the first half isn't afraid to get all dark and gritty- Thorin's telling of the story of the White Orc is beyond tragic and you really feel for the elves. And when we shift into the action-packed second half- from there on the film just blows your mind. I loved Gollum's cameo- it was funny as hell and scary too, and his scenes with Bilbo are just as fun as the intercut action scenes between the orcs, Gandalf and the elves. Also, the last 30 minutes may be the most exciting in a while. I can't remember the last time I've been that on the edge of my seat.Is The Hobbit a &#34;great&#34; film, per se? Maybe not. I don't know, honestly. All I know is that I really enjoyed it, as a fan of the book, and if anything, as high as my expectations were, they weren't high enough, if the multiple viewings were any indication. I definitely feel that the book has been done great justice, and it does what all &#34;first act&#34; movies should do- leave me wanting more. Sure it's full of flaws, but isn't everything, nowadays? And besides, The Hobbit gives another few years of Middle Earth to look forward to, so that's a plus.

This expanded version is not exactly the book though the fleshing out is derived from Tolkien's other works like the Silmarillion. These back stories given screen time is a nice set up for the following Lord of the Rings so all is not terrible. The one drawback is how hard it is to translate such a broad ranging adventure romp without losing the story's heart. So far the balancing act is holding but if they continue to push it this could become a mess mired in it's own good intentions.The casting is spot on and while I'm not fond of the costuming effects I'll let it slide because the other option was to go all digital or for the characters to look too much like regular humans. Sometimes it gets in the way but most of the time of flows smoothly.The color pallet is also a richer for this film than the previous LOTR series but I think it denotes a different time and mood and works very well with few reservations.

1449653,A1WXKAKSAQD2YH,B0059XTU1S,Richard Costa,"[0, 0]","All three of the LOTR film are timeless classics and some of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. All three films were extremely powerful, immensely emotional, unbelievably gut wrenching and epic beyond words.So now, Nine years later, a prequel trilogy is being made with Peter Jackson back in the director's chair. That alone had me sold. What could possibly go wrong? Actually, I think a more fitting question to ask is &#34;What the hell went wrong?&#34;There is a rather rough transition from &#34;The Return of The King&#34; to &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; as far as tone goes. King was an all-out war movie. The film was literally three and a half hours of huge battles. &#34;Journey&#34;, however, is an all-out kid's movie, which brings me to my first point.One of the two problems I had with the film was just how juvenile it was. I guess that could be my fault for going to see movie based on kid's book. But, as a prequel to the LOTR films, I thought it would be a little more, well, mature. The film has everything from burping contests to snot jokes to even a sing along musical number. (That seen had me crouching down in my seat, embarrassed that I was seeing this film on my own time.)The second problem I had was the pacing. The first hour of the film is so slow. Way too much exposition! It's like a half hour of old Bilbo giving backstory to 45 minutes of the Dwarfs singing and going over plans at Bilbo's house. Even when the new adventure begging, thing barley pick up, as they keep on stopping to give us more exposition.Ok, I'm done with the bad stuff. On the other hand: the last hour of the film was consistently entertaining. In fact, Peter Jackson threw in a few scenes that brought back warm memories of the last 3 films. 1st: He adds moments that let us have a glimpse of the enormous heart that made the other films so unforgettable. Gandalf's speech about heroes to Cate Blanchet and Bilbo's speech to Dwarfs about Home at the end of the film were both touching.There were two other scenes that genuinely moved me. The first was the scene where Bilbo is invisible because of the Ring and he holds his sword up to Gollum&#8217;s neck. He is about to swing, but Gollum then turns around and can see that he is destroyed and heartbroken over the loss of the ring, his big blue eyes holding in tears. Bilbo lowers the sword.The second the last scene when Thorin finally accepts Bilbo. He starts yelling at Bilbo about how he knew from the beginning that Bilbo would be nothing but a useless burden and would do nothing but get in the way. He then finishes by breaking down and saying that he's never been more wrong in his life. When he hugged Bilbo, my heart honestly skipped a beat.The emotional moments were only half of what made the other trilogy so great. The other half is being so genuinely epic. There is a scene at the end when Thorin lays eyes on the Orc leader who..., wronged him in some way years earlier. Thorin lifts up his sword and in slow motion, runs at the Orc across the burning tree with the song playing from LOTR when the hooded riders are chasing Frodo on their black horses.Also, Christopher Lee's cameo was a very present surprise.(surprise to me at least. I guess I didn't read the cast list beforehand. Up until the credits rolled I thought Legolas was going to be in it. I kept on waiting for him to show up, even in the final scene.)It's the warm memories from LOTR that would make me recommend the film to any (patient) moviegoers.",3,"Mediocre and somewhat disappointing as a LOTR prequel, but a good movie by it's own standards.",1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,3507,"['three', 'LOTR', 'film', 'are', 'timeless', 'classics', 'greatest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'three', 'films', 'were', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'immensely', 'emotional', 'unbelievably', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'epic', 'words.So', 'now', 'Nine', 'years', 'later', 'prequel', 'trilogy', 'being', 'made', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'back', 'director', 'chair', 'alone', 'had', 'sold', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Actually', 'think', 'more', 'fitting', 'question', 'ask', '34', 'What', 'hell', 'went', 'wrong', '34', 'rather', 'rough', 'transition', '34', 'Return', 'King', '34', '34', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', '34', 'as', 'far', 'tone', 'King', 'was', 'all-out', 'war', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'literally', 'three', 'half', 'hours', 'huge', 'battles', '34', 'Journey', '34', 'however', 'all-out', 'kid', 'movie', 'first', 'point.One', 'two', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'juvenile', 'was', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'kid', 'book', 'prequel', 'LOTR', 'films', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'well', 'mature', 'film', 'everything', 'burping', 'contests', 'snot', 'jokes', 'even', 'sing', 'along', 'musical', 'number', 'seen', 'had', 'crouching', 'down', 'seat', 'embarrassed', 'was', 'seeing', 'film', 'own', 'time', 'second', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'pacing', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'so', 'slow', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'half', 'hour', 'old', 'Bilbo', 'giving', 'backstory', '45', 'minutes', 'Dwarfs', 'singing', 'going', 'plans', 'Bilbo', 'house', 'Even', 'when', 'new', 'adventure', 'begging', 'thing', 'barley', 'pick', 'up', 'keep', 'stopping', 'give', 'more', 'exposition.Ok', ""'m"", 'done', 'bad', 'stuff', 'other', 'hand', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'was', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'threw', 'few', 'scenes', 'brought', 'back', 'warm', 'memories', 'last', '3', 'films', '1st', 'moments', 'let', 'have', 'glimpse', 'enormous', 'heart', 'made', 'other', 'films', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'Gandalf', 'speech', 'heroes', 'Cate', 'Blanchet', 'Bilbo', 'speech', 'Dwarfs', 'Home', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'first', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Bilbo', 'invisible', 'Ring', 'sword', 'up', 'Gollum', '8217', 'neck', 'swing', 'Gollum', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'destroyed', 'heartbroken', 'loss', 'ring', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'holding', 'tears', 'Bilbo', 'sword.The', 'second', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Thorin', 'finally', 'Bilbo', 'yelling', 'Bilbo', 'how', 'knew', 'beginning', 'Bilbo', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'useless', 'burden', 'would', 'do', 'nothing', 'get', 'way', 'then', 'breaking', 'down', 'saying', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'life', 'When', 'hugged', 'Bilbo', 'heart', 'honestly', 'skipped', 'beat.The', 'emotional', 'moments', 'were', 'only', 'half', 'what', 'made', 'other', 'trilogy', 'so', 'great', 'other', 'half', 'being', 'so', 'genuinely', 'epic', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Thorin', 'eyes', 'Orc', 'leader', 'who', 'wronged', 'way', 'years', 'earlier', 'Thorin', 'up', 'sword', 'slow', 'motion', 'Orc', 'burning', 'tree', 'song', 'playing', 'LOTR', 'when', 'hooded', 'riders', 'are', 'chasing', 'Frodo', 'black', 'horses.Also', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'was', 'very', 'present', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'least', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'cast', 'list', 'beforehand', 'credits', 'rolled', 'thought', 'Legolas', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'kept', 'waiting', 'show', 'up', 'even', 'final', 'scene', 'warm', 'memories', 'LOTR', 'would', 'make', 'recommend', 'film', 'patient', 'moviegoers']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Dalton ""Bob Dalton""","[0, 3]","This film shows clearly what happens when the commercial needs of 3D, coupled with a director's too enthusiastic fascination with playing with new technology, imposes itself over normal 2D. This film series seems to be following in the same exact steps of the mediocre Star Wars prequel trilogy, where special effects also overwhelmed the character part of the story and took over.In order for 3D to be viable and worth doing there must constant action of a specific eye popping variety that looks good in 3D. This is the reason that 3D does not lend itself easily to character driven films which is why you see so few dramatic films in this format. For those who only care about action, and pay little attention to the characters and their dialogue, this is your film.The strength of Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings film trilogy was the often dramatic character interaction and how that evolved over time. That is almost totally lacking here in this film. Both my wife and I found the constant ""rollercoaster"" ride imposed on the storyline tiring and much to the detriment of the overall film.In addition it was very clear to both of us that the director had vastly padded the film out with unnecessary side stories in order to justify having three films when, if he had stuck to the book, two films would have been more than sufficient. Those who have read and loved the original Hobbit book will find themselves constantly scratching their head and asking ""where did that segment come from?"" with this film.Technically from a special effects only perspective the film is excellent, as you would expect these days. It is in the script and character dialogue that this film really comes up short. BTW in viewing this film on my HD flat screen I did not see any problems with 48 FPS versus 24 FPS issue much mentioned in the press.I don't know if Peter Jackson reads these reviews but if he does he is what I would tell him: Peter you can do better than this! Great films are story and character driven first. Everything else should only enhance that and is a distant second.One note for those who have kids. There are a number of decapitations and various ""slicing and dicing"" actions in the many battle sequences. If the enemy had been human instead of goblin or orc, the rating probably would have been an ""R"" instead of the PG13 given to this film.I can only hope the other two films in the series will be better.

""Since hollywood wants to do nothin...","[0, 0]","Having read Tolkien extensively, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVED what Jackson decided to do with the retelling of The Hobbit. To be completely honest, I was quite skeptical when I discovered that a book the size of Tolkien's Hobbit was to be drawn out into 3 films (each at least 2.5 hours in length). However, I stand corrected. Jackson has enriched the original story with expansions into:1) the Dwarf company itself. That's right, even the great Tolkien simply glossed-over the majority of the company to focus on a select few. Jackson has thankfully chosen to make each one recognizable, distinctive and multi-dimensional.2) the quiet resurrection of Sauron's power and armies, which while dealt with extensively in Tolkien's various other writings, was not a focus of his original Hobbit installment.3) Gandalf's absences are finally, fully explained. As well, they add such a fullness to the story overall.4) characters mentioned in passing -- such as Azog the Defiler and Radagast the Brown -- are given a forum for their fascinating talents. This too lends a further strength to the story's already epic feel.To sum it up, Jackson has done a justice to Tolkien's works that I never fathomed a filmmaker ever could. I never imagined a director other than Cecil B. DeMille or Sir David Lean could possibly have the ability to lend such exquisite talents to a well-deserved retelling of Tolkien's epics.

He clearly scammed a lot of people.  There were millions of complaints and Tarantino had to apologize for his misguided attempt to dupe the public and then released the original Grindhouse in its original format and as it was meant to be seen.Jackson and Co. are essentially the same thing by coming out with three (3) count em, three movies of the Hobbit, a small introductory book for children.  The actual Lord of the Rings consisted of three books and resulted in three movies each approximately 3 hours long.  Very reasonable.  Here we have the worst example ever of trying to squeeze the public into buying three separate movies, released over two or three years, at a total running length of 9 hours and at an initial cost to the public of approx. $75.As mentioned, The Hobbit was merely the intro to the Lord of the Rings yet they've absurdly made in into three (3) movies also at the approx. aggregate running time of 9 hours.  How is this possible?  Why isn't everyone up in arms?  Each of the three books that made up the Lord of the Rings and associated DVD's were long enough and to turn a very short introductory story into three separate movies is worst kind of profiteering.I am boycotting the movies and think if enough people say they're sick and tired of all the games and mercenary attitude of people and studios it might prevent this from happening again.  What's next, a six DVD version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""?  Enough is enough and just remember when your watching a movie, as I was when I saw the Hobbit, or thought I was watching the Hobbit, expecting a good ending only to see the equivalent of a prompt on the screen that said ""to be continued"" To say I was very upset is an understatement.  I don't know if the producers adequately informed the public in advance of what they were doing but I had no idea this was just part one (1) and couldn't believe that at the end of the first installment nothing had happened.  That's the way I suspect a lot of people felt and should feel about what the producers, etc.., did regardless of how much money was spent or the quality of the production.

Both are excellent and I have no complaints.The movie is on a single disc, which is probably why we only have one audio commentary (by Peter Jackson and Phillipa Boyens), despite reports of others being recorded.  I suspect this was either to cut costs, or possibly to address the criticism that some had about the LOTR extended versions taking up two Blu-Ray discs (a fact I am grateful for, as it provided us with a superior transfer).As far as the movie goes, there isn't a whole lot added, and some of what is added seems like they might be more appropriate as &#34;deleted scenes.&#34;  There's a song in Goblin Town that, even with this film's lighter tone than LOTR, feels out-of-place.  Of course, if you're a fan like me, you'll probably love all of it.  The added Rivendell scenes are probably the most substantial overall (they've added quite a few new scenes here, some better than others), but a close second are the bits we get to see of the Shire.The special features span an additional TWO discs, which is fantastic.  The documentaries are pretty much everything you'd want them to be, with a few exceptions.  Namely, the adaption process, image galleries, and scoring the film were all lacking (or basically non-existent).This isn't quite as comprehensive as say, the Blu-Ray of Prometheus, but in terms of quantity there is a fair more bit of content, and in terms of quality you couldn't ask for better.

Some will not mind this and even enjoy it. But it comes at the expense of getting around to telling the story of The Hobbit as told in the book.  There was an extended period in the first hour or so where I considered seriously walking out of the theater and not finishing the movie. It just simply seemed to not want to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins. The film could easily have been retitled ""The Dwarves"" because that seemed to be the focus along with the emphasis on connecting it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The film gives Bilbo a great line at the end which finally gives him purpose and is heart warming. But takes the back seat to the Dwarves and the appendices material until the final act. I agree with the critics. The film feels bloated.There was no way I was not going to see this film in 48FPS HFR. Unfortunately my final verdict is that it probably hurt the presentation by sometimes hurting and sometimes helping. Which begs the question why see a film which sometimes looks great and sometimes looks kinda bad when you can see it look real good all the way through. Being there for history seems the best reason. But if you don't care about that see it in 2D 24 because this film suffers from the sense of watching it with sunglasses. Some 3D films do, some don't. But this one feels too gray with 3D glasses on.

You could even argue the bar was set so high that this film was undoubtedly set up to be a partial let down.Okay, so ""The Hobbit"" is based of a significantly shorter base book source. And, to top it off, is being split into three different films that will all be roughly the same length as a LOTR film. Because of this, the film often seems to drag on unnecessarily. For instance, you'll get about 20 minutes of Dwarf introductions and lots of prolonged conversations that are unwelcome gaps in the overall pacing of the film. The story is still great, and there is a lot to enjoy, but this is not a dense story. You'll be dealing with a little fluff.The graphics in this film are stunning! The CGI has already improved significantly since the original 3 films, and it shows. The clarity of Gollum on screen and the countless goblins make for some fun and visually appealing eye candy. The 3D for this film is also a high point. I'm rather critical of 3D as often I find it unnecessary and not worth the extra cost, but in this case I'm willing to pay the extra $5 or so because it's clear a lot of work went into making this films 3D part of the complete immersion of the film, rather than a crappy after thought.",4,"Good, but not as good as LOTR",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1331,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'critiqued', 'more', 'harshly', 'due', 'overall', 'epic', 'expectations', 'set', 'predecessors', 'could', 'even', 'argue', 'bar', 'was', 'set', 'so', 'high', 'film', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'partial', 'let', 'down.Okay', 'Hobbit', 'based', 'significantly', 'shorter', 'base', 'book', 'source', 'top', 'off', 'being', 'split', 'three', 'different', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'roughly', 'same', 'length', 'LOTR', 'film', 'film', 'often', 'drag', 'unnecessarily', 'instance', ""'ll"", 'get', '20', 'minutes', 'Dwarf', 'introductions', 'lots', 'prolonged', 'conversations', 'are', 'unwelcome', 'gaps', 'overall', 'pacing', 'film', 'story', 'still', 'great', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'not', 'dense', 'story', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dealing', 'little', 'fluff.The', 'graphics', 'film', 'are', 'stunning', 'CGI', 'already', 'improved', 'significantly', 'original', '3', 'films', 'clarity', 'Gollum', 'screen', 'countless', 'goblins', 'make', 'fun', 'visually', 'appealing', 'eye', 'candy', '3D', 'film', 'also', 'high', 'point', ""'m"", 'rather', 'critical', '3D', 'often', 'find', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'extra', 'cost', 'case', ""'m"", 'willing', 'pay', 'extra', '5', 'so', 'clear', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'films', '3D', 'part', 'complete', 'immersion', 'film', 'rather', 'crappy', 'thought']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

This has to be one of the most accurate book to movie adaptations ever done, and Jackson sticks to the books events all the way through, only adding more backstory that was touched on in the book, but was never fully explained. Thankfully Jackson draws much of the film's material from The Lord of the Rings appendices, which really makes the movie a lot more interesting. Many people may not realize this, but Tolkien actually spent a lot of time editing and revising the Hobbit to add more story and make it more similar in tone to LotR, but he just never got around to finishing and publishing it. Jackson realized this and tried to make his adaption more faithful to that fact, and that really shows how much respect for Tolkien and his work. It sticks to the events of the book, and smartly adds new character motives to explain why certain things happen, and why certain characters acted the way they did, which wasn't in the book. This review is for the actual movie itself though, and not this edition. In terms of the actual quality of the Blu-Ray disc, the Hobbit  may be the best looking Blu-Ray film I've ever seen. The landscape, CGI, acting, and the soundtrack are amplified by the supreme quality of the disc. Jackson really knows what he's doing with Blu-ray transfers.

He's a reluctant hero with a good heart and extremely likeable. Sir Ian McKellen returns to his role as Gandalf the Grey - a younger Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning roles also include: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel; Ian Holm as Old Bilbo; Christopher Lee as Saruman; Hugo Weaving as Elrond; Elijah Wood as Frodo; and Andy Serkis as Gollum. It's a bit odd going back and doing a prequel story, making characters younger. But with the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's not surprising that The Hobbit was picked up as well.Nine years after the release of the Return of the King also means that the CGI and cinematography is even that much more fantastic. The rich landscapes are breathtaking. And the creature effects are incredibly impressive and life-like. In fact, my only complaint is that the novel The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien has been split into three movies. It felt like parts of this installment could have been skipped in order to fit everything in - and just made into a slightly longer film. But I'm sure the movie makers want the extra money that 3 films can bring instead of 1 or even 2.This first installment in the Hobbit trilogy is a fun, thrilling, adventure. Full of humor, suspense, drama, and magic - fantasy fans will certainly enjoy. Since this is the first in the trilogy of films (and it's based on only one novel) the film ends in an abrupt, awkward place.

NOTE: this is a section for PRODUCT REVIEWS, complaints about Amazon's crap streaming service go to CUSTOMER SERVICE.  But, I digress.As many people have pointed out, this movie is not Tolkien's novel verbatim.  It's significantly altered.  The novel is a great adventure story, I read it about a decade ago.  However, it's not epic.  Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's epic story.  I guess, because Peter Jackson already did the epic trilogy, he wanted to make Tolkien's first novel novel into an epic trilogy as well.  So, there is a LOT of added content.  Unlike some people who have read the novel, I like the film.  It's different but good.  I saw it in a packed theater on Christmas and had to get the Blu-ray the day it was released. So, I bought it in a store instead of waiting for it to be shipped.  The Blu-ray is a great product, the picture is beautiful and the sound is great. The special features are nothing special, the production blogs put me to sleep.  Fortunately, I bought it for the film and not that stuff.  Ultraviolet is useless to me, so no comment on that.

1449742,AUQ3XOJAYHB1Q,B0059XTU1S,"Sean Thomas ""orcslayr23""","[2, 4]","I previously wrote a much more negative review of this movie but I didn't think it was entirely fair; I saw it in 48 FPS and the accelerated frame rate was so distracting that I had a really hard time following the story. Today I saw it in 2D and enjoyed the film much more. So with that said:Cons:Luckily, most of the flaws with this movie are in the 48 fps version. 48 fps makes a lot of the CGI effects look cheap, plus it makes the characters appear to sporadically speed up, like you accidentally hit the fast forward button. The landscape shots are great (as expected), but I also felt like I was watching a documentary.Aside from my 48 fps complaints, I felt like Peter Jackson used more CGI than he had to. I think most (if not all) of the orcs and all of the goblins were CGI this time around, rather than people in costumes (like in the LOTR movies). This isn't a huge complaint, it's just that when I think LOTR orcs, I don't think of the ones in The Hobbit, kind of video gamey. The stone trolls weren't done very well either, kind of like low budget transformers.While the music is great in this movie, a lot of it is recycled from the previous trilogy. While subtle nods to LOTR musically are to be expected, I didn't expect ""Ok, this is where Galadriel makes her first appearance, cue ""Lothlorien"" off the Fellowship soundtrack!"" and ""Bilbo found the ring, cue the mournful violin solo from the trilogy!"" I feel like the ""blunt the knives and chip the plates"" song and ""misty mountains cold"" song felt a bit out of place, but I think with repeat viewings i'll get behind it a bit more.Pros:Considering that they are splitting The Hobbit into 3 movies AND adding stuff from the appendices as well as fleshing out things that Tolkien only hinted at in his books, the team did a bang up job with this film. They spun the story so there was a (greater) focus on Bilbo's transformation. With so many characters and storylines keeping Bilbo at the center was difficult, but they (more or less) pulled it off. The dwarves in the books (aside from Thorin) weren't really developed too well and I really like that all thirteen dwarves have their own personality in the film. Granted, An Unexpected Journey didn't get to give all the dwarves a chance to shine, but that's what the other two movies are for.The casting and acting is spot on as well. Martin Freeman does an excellent job as Bilbo. Gandalf and Thorin are great as well. I was a little worried about Radagast (who of course wasn't in The Hobbit) but they added him in well. He's a bit kooky, but not overly so (I read one review where he compared Radagast to Jar Jar Binks...ridiculous). Gollum is a tad different in this movie than the trilogy, there's a touch more humor in his arguments with himself (which I think works very well), the whole riddles in the dark scene is great. Overall, plot-wise, no complaints.Bottom line, it's great to be back in Middle Earth, but lightning doesn't strike twice. I definitely liked An Unexpected Journey, but nothing in it really ""wowed"" me, and I guess I was hoping for a similar experience to when I first viewed LOTR. I would definitely recommend going to see this, just not in the high frame rate.",5,"Avoid 48 FPS!

1449743,AMP6LJ9WW3YC,B0059XTU1S,sebastian crane,"[12, 28]","Before you object, please keep in mind that this is ONE opinion about ONE aspect of the Middle-earth films.Ok I kept this bottled up for a long time but I must make my feelings of absolute despair known about Peter Jasckson's obsession with cheap gags and so-called ""comic relief."" If you want to include SOME humorous moments I can see that as reasonable, but Jackson didn't give any thought at all to his slapstick and juvenile (and sometimes scatalogical!) humor. At least put some thought into it Jackson. Like every other element in a film expected to draw a reaction from the viewer, humor has to be EARNED. You can't have Gimli burping in the middle of a serious disagreement between two kings discussing the safety of their peoples, and expect to get an Oscar for the acting in that scene, or any others which involve Gimli's gags and pratfalls. One other reviewer on here said he had taken a class on Tolkien in college. Well, let me tell you I TAUGHT a college course on Tolkien, which testifies to my great love for Tolkien's work. The most egregious and insulting misrepresentation or misinterpretation of Tolkien's work is to cast both the Hobbits and the Dwarves as comic fools. First of all, Jackson does not seem to understand that Merry and Pippin are upper-class hobbits, with a sort of nobility, if you like. And Frodo and Bilbo are considered strange, nouveau riche, figures by the people of Hobbitown. I assume Jackson just took the easiest, most puerile route in making short characters the foolish ones, both in the Hobbit and in the LotR trilogy. The bit when Pippin volunteers for the quest and asks ""where are we going?"" was indeed in the book, but Jackson totally misread (or disregarded) the context of it. It was intended to be a very ""English"" demonstration of Pippin's wit, not a show of stupidity (it goes back to the style of Restoration Drama, wherein the upper classes were always jockeying for a chance to put their wit on display). Also, did Jackson even read The Silmarillion, or did he just disregard it as well? The Dwarves were created by one of the Valar, (just like the other races) and they were made short and stocky for a specific reason, and it most definitely was NOT so they could be laughed at by the other denizens of Middle-earth. It would not have been an issue to the other people of Middle-earth. In fact, they probably wouldn't take notice of it at all since that's just how they were created by the gods. The Dwarves accomplished great deeds in past battles against Melkor, and they even wore masks to strike fear into their opponents. They are a brave and noble race.Again, it's as if Jackson didn't put any thought into it at all, falling back on the low-brow humor of slapstick and hijinks. Instead of being engrossed in the film, I was constantly ripped out of it by the jokes and found myself cringing and rolling my eyes. My suspension of disbelief can only go so far. Jackson really went overboard with the gags in The Hobbit (The Fellowship of the Ring is a far better film in my estimation, despite its silliness at times). Even the great humorist Woody Allen knew when to dial back the humor for the sake of the drama (Match Point, anybody?) Shame on you Jackson, for disrespecting Tolkien's work. Now we won't get another film based on the Middle-earth legendarium for 50 years. Jackson was not the man to direct or write these films. Is it just a coincidence that for the first time in history, a film won 13 academy awards (Return of the King) and was not even nominated for any acting awards? Why? because the writing was so bad; instead of being allowed to really act, the cast members had to tell jokes and be funny throughout their dialogue. At least the Amazon reviewer seems to agree with me, charging the film with engaging in ""tedious,"" cheap humor. It has bothered me to such an extent that I have looked into buying a film editing program and cutting out the intrusive gags, just like that guy did with The Phantom Edit in cutting out Jar Jar's scenes and making the movie more comprehensible overall. Does anybody know of a good program for that? J.R.R. Tolkien was an intellectual and classy writer. Yes this is a book for adolescents, but Tolkien wrote it with CLASS. He would never debase himself to make a joke of Radagast perpetually having bird poop running down the side of his face. Peter Jackson has no such scruples. He wallows in the lowest of low humor. And he can't resist that infelicitous mix of elevated English speech and vulgar modern idioms. What was the deal with the retarded looking dwarf with the sling-shot threatening to stick something up Smaug's jacksie?I can hear the responses already: ""The film would be too serious without comic relief."" Well, I ask, was The Godfather too serious? Was The Exorcist too serious? Was Flight 93 too serious? Was Syriana too serious? Or did I just miss all the gags and jokes in those movies? Moreover, there is hardly any humor to be found in the Silmarillion, which is the central work for the whole legendarium. Another response will be that The Hobbit was written for children and so it MUST have a lot of comic relief. Ok, fine, I can understand that, But for goodness' sake Peter, use your brain a little and stop wallowing in the sandbox of low-brow humor. And let a REAL WRITER write the scripts. I believe that the Silmarillion can be filmed (perhaps in the style of something like Clash of the Titans), but if Jackson directs, he's got to hand over the writing duties to someone else.I would also agree with others who have criticized the film for its overly-obvious CGI renderings. You'd think by now, that Weta would be able to make a character like Azog (and the goblin king for that matter) look much more realistic. I was rather shocked at how computer-y he looked.The bright spot really is Martin Freeman. Although his lines are not always great, he does a fine job with the material he is given.This is a bit of a digression, but I need to respond to those who think The Hobbit is far to short a book to warrant a trilogy of films. Remember that Jackson, in fact, is essentially working with three books: The Hobbit, The Book of Lost Tales, and Unfinished Tales, not to mention the extensive appendices at the end of LotR. He's got plenty of material to fill out three movies' worth.Another digression. This is a minor complaint, but it has always gnawed at me that Gollum says his name in a hacking cough. Doesn't make much sense to me. The name was supposed to have resulted from the warbling sound he made in his throat. I'm not sure how you could get ""Gollum"" out of a coughing sound, or how Gollum can't help but say it when he coughs.Well, that's my 3 cents anyway. And please remember people, this is just an opinion about ONE aspect of the films. If you like the films, humor and all, then I'm glad for you. I have no beef with anyone who has a differing opinion. I am aware that I speak for a minority of viewers, but I do hope those who find this review helpful would chime in with your own thoughts.",2,Drop the gross gags and focus on the drama,1362873600,"03

In the theatre this movie was a 3 star in my opinion as there was just to much to process in one viewing. Now that i have it at home (borrowed) i may have to consider buying it. There is just so much happening in this film i wish they could have figured out a way to tell this story with some better details and it not feeling so rushed after a hour into it. I would have liked more of a back story on the dwarves and let us get to know them a bit better. Same thing with the 5 wizards.  This is a good movie although it has flaws, im growing to like it alot more. One thing that LOTR has over this is the pace'ing or FLOW, thats right, Flow, it goes at a nice even pace from start to finish and through all three movies, i feel the ""flow"" of the Hobbit is all over the place. I dont suppose its a bad thing, its just not what were used to in these middle earth movies. Ive been breaking this movie into sections and watching 30 minutes to a hour each day, it makes it easier to digest and i feel like i can process what im seeing a little better  (like i have the rest of the day to chew on what ive just watched) and WOW, doing it this way there are just all kinds of details jumping out all over the place at me that i didnt get at the theatre.  This is a good movie, just take your time with it.**Spoiler alert** the first hour is dwarves taking over bilbos place and singing alot.. the next two hours felt kinda rushed, I just watched this movie and i swear i cant remember half of it.. thats how unimpressed i was.. I liked going back to middle earth and im a huge LOTR fan, Ive never read this book and im afraid to now considering many are saying this movie stinks by comparison. Im going to have to re-watch this again before part two comes out as im going to be lost otherwise.

1449760,AHJK8Y7IG1RSE,B0059XTU1S,Sheepy,"[6, 13]","So Peter Jackson is back in the director's chair to put the classic whimsical Tolkien novel The Hobbit on screen.  What you get here is part 1 of a 3 part trilogy of a 290 page book.  Yeah, seriously.  This film is riddled with poor dialogue, violence at every corner, Jackson and company treat the audience like a bunch of morons with their script, unnecessary changes made to the book, and deviates from what is important in the novel, which is Bilbo Baggins' craftiness!  What should have been maybe two shorter films or one long film of whimsical fun has/will be turned into 9 hours of paycheck for Jackson.Now I don't want to be completely unfair, let's start with the good things in the movie.THE GOOD---The dialogue.  But wait, didn't I say the dialogue was bad?  Yes, the dialogue is terrible, but there are moments when the dialogue is brilliant, and the only time those times happen is when they actually USE THE DIALOGUE TOLKIEN WROTE.  The scene where Gandalf meets Bilbo and exchange good mornings, that was perfection and that is what this movie should have been.  Riddles in the Dark is relatively good because they use TOLKIEN'S dialogue.  Tolkien was a master with words and the dialogue is almost 100% written for this book.  Whenever the dialogue from Tolkien's pen is used, it works great.Bilbo spares Gollum.  The scene where Bilbo spares Gollum's life is a fantastic scene.  It was moving.  It worked.  We finally get to see what should be the main character BILBO be the centerpiece of something moving.Gandalf and some of the opening.  I actually really enjoyed the opening scene where they show the Kingdom Under the Mountain Erebor.  It was great.  Gandalf was well done as well.THE BAD----Most of the opening.  The opening should have been introducing Erebor and cut straight to Bilbo outside of his house being visited by Gandalf.  No, we get an unnecessary cameo from Frodo Baggins and Ian Holm.  Come on.  This is where it starts for the second worse thing in the film and that is....LOOK, REMEMBER THIS FROM LORD OF THE RINGS???  Ok Peter Jackson, we get it, Frodo was in LOTR.  Yeah we know, look its Elrond, Sarumon, and Galadriel from LOTR.  Holy crap its Rivendell, remember that from Lord of the Rings?  Remember this?  Remember that?  What the heck is Jackson thinking about?  This film should be focused on Bilbo and finding the magic ring, but what we get is a slew of ""Look audience, remember this?!?!?!""  Did the script writers seriously sit there and decide, hey we should show this to remind the audience that it was in Lord of the Rings!  This is garbage writing.  More on the writing soon.Aragor....I mean Thorin.  Jackson and company have ruined Thorin.  He doesn't even match the description in the book.  Read the book.  Thorin is a glorified dwarf with a long flowing grey beard (which stood for strength) and was tough.  What we get here is Thorin, the douche-bag bro from Jersey Shore.  Thorin is terrible.  Jackson has said frequently that the films he makes should be Tolkien's film.  Hey Peter, read the book kid.  So since we established that Peter and the other script writers either can't read or just used the pages from the Hobbit for toilet paper for the crew....Violence, some plot, violence, walk, violence.  How is there not a universal consensus that this film is just more typical Jackson violence.  The book's first bit of violence is when Gandalf and Thorin find swords in the Troll's cave and then they are the only two that wield weapons.  The Dwarves didn't even set out from Hobbiton armed.  What we get though are 13 dwarves prepared to cut down anything in their path.  Since we armed the Dwarves, Jackson might as well insert as many battle scenes as possible.  This is insulting to Tolkien who wrote his novels as a sort of ""war is the last option,"" but it makes me battle fatigued.  Its just one thing after another.  Fight fight fight fight.  It isn't even good.  The scene in the Goblin Cave is just ridiculous.  It treats violence like breathing.  Just happens, nothing special here, just move on!  With that said....Liberty with scenes/inserted scenes.  The scene with the three trolls.  Read the book.  Each Dwarf gets snatched up in secret.  Let's cut into Jackson's script writing session:Peter Jackson: So in the next chapter of the book, the trolls secretly capture all the dwarves and Bilbo uses cunning to get them out.  Hmmmm....there is no violence or a fight.  Ok, scratch that, Tolkien doesn't know what he is doing, I got this.  They will fight and fight some more.This is all over.  Jackson inserts so many stupid useless scenes.  Let's just ignore the stupid cameos from Galadriel, Sarumon and Radagast.  More garbage.  This film should be focused on BILBO.  Not all this other useless garbage.Wrong central theme.  Instead of Bilbo being the main character, we get the story focused on #1, Thorin.  #2, Look here is how this will connect with Lord of the Rings (Radagast, Sarumon, ect.), and then #3.  Jackson finally said, oh yeah, Bilbo is in this story too, better put him in somewhere.  Garbage.Lastly and my favorite stupid thing from this movie, the dialogue and treating the audience like morons as written by Peter Jackson.  Let's start with the blatant foreshadowing from Peter Jackson.  Early in the film Gandalf clearly tells Bilbo it is important to make a good decision on whether or not to kill someone, to show pity.  Here is exact quote "" True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.""  GEE, THANKS PETER.  I'm glad you think your audience is far too stupid to realize that something might happen later.  This is all over the film.  Peter Jackson thinks so highly of himself and so little of his audience he resorts to that garbage plot writing and instead of using Tolkien's witty and beautiful dialogue, he replaces it with fight scenes, CGI and very poor written dialogue.Oh my god, the dialogue.....it is TERRIBLE.  You can tell which pieces of speech are written by Tolkien in the book and which pieces of dialogue are written by our genius writers in Peter Jackson, his wife and Fran Walsh.  If the dialogue sounds like an after-school cartoon special ""When there is sickness, bad things happen,"" (that is actually in the film) you KNOW Jackson was in on it.  Or the last scenes when Thorin talks to Bilbo, just terrible.  I cannot believe how bad the dialogue is.  ""Do you smell it?  The scent of fear.""  Oh god....am I watching Lifetime?This movie is absolute garbage.  Hollywood, CGI, garbage of a literary masterpiece crafted by a master writer.  There is a reason Christopher Tolkien calls his father's work on the Hobbit being ""eviscerated"" by Peter Jackson.",2,A Moldy Dialogue Sandwich With Too Much of a Condiment Called

In brief:+ If you keep in mind that it's an adaptation of Tolkien's story (or based on his story), then it's a decent story in its own right. But if you think that you're going to watch a movie of the original book, you'll be disappointed at the changes.+ The parts of the screenplay that were added to stretch this short book into three movies can't compare to the quality of Tolkien's work. They're actually pretty bad, and the discrepancy is rather jolting. They worked too hard to give this movie more ties to LOTR than the original book has, and the story doesn't support it very well. And the great white Orc hunting Thorin is just a stupid addition that doesn't enhance the original story.+ I don't know whether it was Peter Jackson's decision or Ian McKellen's, but Gandalf mumbles and mutters most of his lines. I couldn't see the point of that.+ There are several shots that are so over-dramatized that you can only blame it on horrible directing decisions. Two examples are when Thorin turns and faces the camera at the end of Balin's retelling of the battle with the Orcs, and when Gandalf first sees  Galadriel at Rivendell -- it's like she's on some platform that slowly rotates her to face him in an overly dramatic fashion that breaks any realism the movie was trying to sustain. And those aren't the only shots with that kind of problem.Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon doesn't have half stars, I'll go with just 3. I think they would have ended up with a better movie if they had only planned it in two parts instead of being greedy and trying to stretch it to three.

However, I do not think that Peter Jackson and the other producers deserve any real pats on the back for this one. It is a steep, steep step down from the Lord of the Rings, and more to the point, not nearly as good as it could have/should have been on its own terms. But I will concede that it is fine as lively, varied adventure film, entertainment value if you will. So there is that.The good points include most of the casting, the expectedly rich set and costume design, and the pitch-perfect portrayal of Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, which is easily the best scene in the film. There are some nice moments of humor, some reassuring familiar faces, and a few glimpses of some of the Hobbit-specific elements that will be the focus of the next film. And I have to mention how much I love the low, moody song that the dwarves sing about going to the Misty Mountains. A wondrous bit of character music, there.On the other hand, the fact that the producers are misguidedly trying to use the Hobbit (a relatively short, unpretentious adventure tale) as a host-body for another epic LOTR-style trilogy is painfully, awkwardly evident all over this film. The pacing at the beginning is ridiculous. It is obviously dragging on simply to fill a running-time quota (and not a brief running time). So much for the artistic merit of stretching the Hobbit across three films. There are many added-in characters and plot elements. Some of them may be sourced from Tolkien's other writings, and thus technically canon, but in almost no case here to they really make the story any better, if indeed they do not make it worse. Finally, there are the visual effects. They seem much more cartoonish and CGI-centric than what I recall from Peter Jackson's previous films. Which is to say, cheaper. Some of the humor is also far cheaper than it has any business to be in a Tolkien film. But I could just go on...Ultimately, to me it is very painfully clear that financial ambitions gained the upper hand over artistic integrity. There is nothing wrong with enjoying this film of course, but it represents a sad regression from the exceptionally high level of craftsmanship and fidelity that governed the LOTR films. One might argue that the Hobbit should not be compared to LOTR, and I agree. The problem here is that the filmmakers missed that memo themselves, thus this film is not really trying to be the Hobbit so much as another Fellowship of the Ring. Which it is not. The result of that identity crisis is that, in my opinion, this is a mediocre-to-decent film at best.",3,Decent Fantasy Adventure - Disappointing Adaption,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,2630,"['Obviously', 'lot', 'love', 'film', 'great', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'other', 'producers', 'deserve', 'real', 'pats', 'back', 'one', 'steep', 'steep', 'step', 'down', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'more', 'point', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have/should', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'terms', 'will', 'concede', 'fine', 'lively', 'varied', 'adventure', 'film', 'entertainment', 'value', 'will', 'So', 'that.The', 'good', 'points', 'include', 'most', 'casting', 'expectedly', 'rich', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'pitch-perfect', 'portrayal', 'Bilbo', 'encounter', 'Gollum', 'easily', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'humor', 'reassuring', 'familiar', 'few', 'glimpses', 'Hobbit-specific', 'elements', 'will', 'be', 'focus', 'next', 'film', 'have', 'mention', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'low', 'moody', 'song', 'dwarves', 'sing', 'going', 'Misty', 'Mountains', 'A', 'wondrous', 'bit', 'character', 'music', 'there.On', 'other', 'hand', 'fact', 'producers', 'are', 'misguidedly', 'trying', 'use', 'Hobbit', 'relatively', 'short', 'unpretentious', 'adventure', 'tale', 'host-body', 'epic', 'LOTR-style', 'trilogy', 'painfully', 'awkwardly', 'evident', 'film', 'pacing', 'beginning', 'ridiculous', 'obviously', 'dragging', 'simply', 'fill', 'running-time', 'quota', 'not', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'So', 'much', 'artistic', 'merit', 'stretching', 'Hobbit', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'added-in', 'characters', 'plot', 'elements', 'may', 'be', 'sourced', 'Tolkien', 'other', 'writings', 'thus', 'technically', 'canon', 'almost', 'case', 'here', 'really', 'make', 'story', 'better', 'indeed', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'worse', 'Finally', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'CGI-centric', 'what', 'recall', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'previous', 'films', 'Which', 'say', 'cheaper', 'humor', 'also', 'far', 'cheaper', 'business', 'be', 'Tolkien', 'film', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'Ultimately', 'very', 'painfully', 'clear', 'financial', 'ambitions', 'gained', 'upper', 'hand', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'enjoying', 'film', 'course', 'sad', 'regression', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'level', 'craftsmanship', 'fidelity', 'governed', 'LOTR', 'films', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'Hobbit', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'LOTR', 'agree', 'problem', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'missed', 'memo', 'thus', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'trying', 'be', 'Hobbit', 'so', 'much', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Which', 'not', 'result', 'identity', 'crisis', 'opinion', 'mediocre-to-decent', 'film', 'best']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth, Ponyo,Hanna) and Hugo Weaving (the Matrix films, Captain America, Cloud Atlas) also play important roles with the characters of Galadriel and Elrond. The artistic detail of the orcs and goblins are done in a one of a kind fashion, but I admit that they also remind me a little of some of the villain characters from my husband's World of Warcraft computer game. Many of the characters played an integral part to the plot of this film.

1449811,A33PHV84OHDJMN,B0059XTU1S,Steve,"[0, 0]","Being an owner of almost two dozen Blu Ray 3D movie releases purchased in past year  I was always enjoying  each and every one of them on my 106"" projector screen and Optoma HD83 gear and latest Optoma BG-ZF2100GLS glasses. The announcement of Hobbit - a ""masterpiece"" as called by many reviewers made me believe this is going to be even more breathtaking movie experience I have ever seen so far. Long preorder wait rewarded with disk set arrival was supposed to exceed my expectations - but it didn't.Right from the start, the first seconds of the movie made me think there is something wrong with my gear as 3D picture seemed to be crisp and clear as usual but unusually stereoscopic where instantly I noticed unnatural depth of field which made my eyes tired just after few minutes of watching. This is the same effect when short sided person gets the glasses with bad eye pupillary distance. To eliminate or confirm gear issue I replaced the disk with three other 3D movies I watched in the past: I Robot, Avatar and Prometheus. All three confirmed there is nothing wrong with the gear showing perfect picture as usual without any eye related discomfort.I put back the Hobbit disk and the problem came back. I had to actually change the viewing distance and get further away from the screen to the back wall of my projection room to make viewing acceptable. This is very unusual move because so far the distance from the screen never mattered and watching 3D movies from any distance or any angle was always enjoyable without any flaws or discomfort.I followed the observation path of unnatural depth of field, and I have noticed that the actual amount of L-R picture shift is dramatically different comparing to other three movies I mentioned above.  The easiest way to check it is to turn on subtitles and check the relative shift between L and R frame by looking at the subtitle letters with the 3D glasses not used. I noticed that on Hobbit the shift is far greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end. But I was disappointed that the actual BD transfer is bad and causes my eyes tired for the first time I watch 3D movie. Among many others I own, this is the first one and probably the last one in the Hobbit series - at least in 3D version.I  took a time and played 2D version disk and the picture was perfect, natural although two-dimensional.

1449814,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0059XTU1S,Steven Aldersley,"[5, 16]","After the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I hoped and expected that director Peter Jackson would stick to the same format for The Hobbit. In some ways he does, but the feel isn't exactly the same.What I like about this first installment of Tolkien's first trip to Middle Earth is that the same sets are used for Hobbiton, and many of the actors return. It was also a good idea to reprise some of the music used in the previous trilogy. When I saw the familiar setting and heard the music, I was already partly won over by the movie. Unfortunately, my opinion had changed long before it finally ended.So why do I have mixed feelings?The first major problem was the decision to make this much shorter story into a trilogy. Many of the scenes felt overly long, and did not serve much purpose. I didn't have a watch or a phone with me, but it seemed as if we spent around an hour in Bilbo's house before the quest even began.The Hobbit is the tale of Bilbo's first adventure. After a visit from Gandalf (Ian McKellen), dwarves start showing up at his house unannounced. This unwelcome interruption of his routine is disturbing to Bilbo (Martin Freeman), as he learns that Gandalf has persuaded the dwarves that Bilbo should join their quest to retrieve their stolen gold from the dragon, Smaug. This part of the story shows the initial stages of that journey.I'm not really sure what The Hobbit wanted to be, or what the intended audience was. Like the books, some of the scenes involve characters breaking into song on a few occasions. I found this to be annoying rather than charming, but I am sure that some will be happy that songs were included. One of the flaws with the generally excellent previous trilogy was the use of humor. Well, The Hobbit turns that element up several notches, and most of it is incredibly stupid. The first clue was a belching scene at dinner in Bilbo's house, but the humor was relentless. The most out of place example was when one of the major villains died and had to deliver a one-liner as he expired. For me, this had the effect of completely removing any tension or drama. It was like watching a Roger Moore Bond movie set in Middle Earth.The choice of Freeman as Bilbo seemed odd to me, but I must admit that he did a decent job. A few of his lines were actually funny.I'm sorry to belabor the point, but the use of humor seemed to contradict the overall feel of the movie. Half of the speeches were too epic in tone to be taken seriously. I didn't know whether I was watching a Shakespearean production, a spoof, or an action movie. One of the people sitting behind me felt compelled to laugh at almost every line of dialogue, so the jokes obviously worked for somebody. My idea of humor would be to have Hugo Weaving saying ""Mister Oakenshield"" in his best Agent Smith voice, so it's probably a good thing that I didn't write the screenplay.It's a shame that The Hobbit doesn't seem to be up to the same standard set by Lord of the Rings. The movie's opening has been incredibly successful, and my theater was still sold out two weeks after it was released. I have to wonder how many patrons will return for the remainder of the trilogy.The setting is beautiful, and some of the actors return, but there are too many inconsistencies for me to give The Hobbit a passing grade. If you want to hang out in Middle Earth, watch some great special effects, and admire some enormously detailed sets, you might enjoy the movie. If you care about the books, or the characters, you may be sorely disappointed. I saw the film four hours ago and can only put faces to the names of four of the dwarves. They were thinly-drawn at best.This release might just persuade me to skip the other two installments in theaters.

A animated loading symbol is shown for the 10 or 20 seconds it takes to load.  Then quick flash of the Warner Brother's screen and you are at the main menu.  Press ""play"", two anti-piracy screens appear for a few seconds each, and the movie begins. That's all.  THREE CHEERS FOR WARNER BROTHERS!!!!In contrast, Sony's ""Men in Black 3"" (by no means the most annoying Bluray I've purchased lately) takes forever to load, leaving you with a blank black screen while loading, then several ""previews"" of other movies you have to fast-forward through (because the ""disc menu"" button is disabled), then 4 (FOUR!!!!) long antipiracy screens, then a long general disclaimer screen, then a disclaimer screen regarding internet features.  All Sony disc are like this.  Many other Blurays and movie companies/distributors are worse, I've had to fast forward through seemingly a dozen ""previews"" on other discs each; others have opening screen after screen of distributors, producers, and contributors (such as THX for the sound processing).  Many anti-piracy screens seem to hold for 30 seconds or so.  On one disc, I had to choose ""Language"" before I could get to the menu.  Why do we tolerate this crap??  Because we have no choice.THE HOBBIT MOVIETHE BAD> The good news is that surely there will be no ""extended edition"" to buy in a few years.  In fact, I'm kinda hoping for a ""condensed"" edition.  The movie is just too long with too many exaggerated chase scenes.  There is just so much adrenaline the body can absorb---I've already crashed by the time the movie is at the 2/3rds point.> I was particularly annoyed by the grossly overlong, cartoonish chase scenes in the orc cave, which must have been 10,000s of hours of CGI at a cost of $10s millions of dollars.  About 1/4 the length would have been fine.THE GOOD> The Bluray is absolutely stunning--razor sharp.  The cinemaphotography is superb.  The CGI seemless.> The introduction, with the ""Lord of the Rings"" Bilbo and Frodo is a stroke of genius.> The trolls sequence reminded me of ny High School years, long long ago.  Actually, the dwarves and orcs were a bit unpleasantly ""familiar"".> The actor playing (young) Bilbo is terrific.> Although I'd have prefered a version truer to the book, most of the additions are from the unreadable ""Silmarillion"" and other Tolkien material, and make the story more consistent as a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"".  I suspect that if Tolkien himself had had a chance to re-write the Hobbit, he would have done something similar.EVALUATIONLike many reviewers, if I were in control, the movie would have followed the book more closely, would have been better paced, and would have been more adult.  BUT it is what it is, and what it is is MAGNIFICIENT.3D?Why not?  If it's only a few bucks more and comes with the 2D Bluray.  No doubt the 3D version is spectacular.  But I didn't consider the 3D.  As it happens I have a $5000 state-of-the-art 3D capable system, but every 3D movie I've seen (including Avitar) gives me a migraine headache within 20 minutes.  The fact is, regardless of the claims of producers who've dumped $10s of millions into developing 3D cameras and technology, 3D movies simply are not filmed the way the human eye sees and interprets 3D.  If you see 3D, your mind assumes that you can selectively focus on any part of the scene you want, say on the background, even if the action is in the foreground---but you actually can't---because the background is intentionally out-of-focus, so you brain is in constant conflict with your eyes, telling your eyes to focus on things that it can't.  If you veiw an image that is only 2D (as in a photograph or an ordinary 2D movie) your mind takes 3D cues from sharpness of focus, proportions, etc. and ""reads"" 3D into 2D images, without any eyestrain.  A real 3D experience would require the entire image (foreground, subject, and background) to be in perfect sharp focus.

Lot of great scenes and lot a bad scenes. This is the Phantom Menace of LOTR.Personal Pros:- Best Blu Ray 3D movie ever made. Even better than Avatar and Titanic.- Great sound if you have surround sound hooked up.- Character CGI was great for the most part.- Some nice actions scenes.- Loved seeing some familiar faces, places, and items returning.- Actor Martin Freeman did a fantastic job as Bilbo.Personal Cons:- Most of the CGI backround settings around the actors were just horrible looking and fake. Didn't mesh well. Was very spoiled by the many real buildings and backrounds made from the scratch from the original LOTR movies.- Interaction and scenes from the Trolls was just plain stupid and dumb. Worst thing is that they talked. Was annoying.- Love Gollum. However, the scene was dragging on way way too long. Ended up being very stupid and boring. I just wanted it to end. Went nowhere.- Didn't like the Goblin King. Was just plain annoying and stupid. Shouldn't have made him talk in english. Just use to the main baddies from the other LOTR movies were fearful and badass.- Way too many dwarfs to keep track of. No room for any character development. I don't remember most of their names. If one was missing, I wouldn't miss any.- Felt like a they made a kid's version of a LOTR movie like the Phantom Menace.- Don't know what was wrong with the audio on the 3D disc. I got the music, sound, and effects. The audio from all of the talking was muted or cut in and out most of the time. Exchanged it and same result. Tried everything in my PS3 settings. The sound worked fine for my other new released movies I just watched. I had to turn off my receiver and watch the rest of the movie just in stereo sound from my TV.

One of the editors of LOTR said that sometimes, less is better.  That applies to this movie.The Bilbo in this movie is boring with very little personality.  Ian Holm has set a high standard for this role.  Martin Freeman is just not Bilbo, even a young Bilbo.Have you seen a miniature horse?  Do you know why a miniature horse is not a pony?  It's because a miniature horse has the same proportions as a horse, not a pony.  Why is this important?  The dwarfs in The Hobbit are miniature men.  Gimli was a dwarf.  These dwarfs are dwarfs in name only.  This tactic probably lowered the cost of making this movie but at the cost of looking authentic.If this was a stand alone movie, I probably would have given it a higher rating.  But it follows the masterpiece of LOTR and doesn't approach the quality of that trilogy.

1449842,AAZGCZ0J2QNSA,B0059XTU1S,Sweet1,"[1, 2]","This won't be a review as much as it will be an explanation as to why the critics are wrong.Critics,  Peter Jackson expanded this into THREE MOVIES!!  Did you actually come into this expecting to see ""The Hobbit"" alone?  Well if you did,  that was a mistake.  When I first saw this in theaters I too was doing the whole,  ""That's not how they did it in the book!  That's different!  I don't like different!""  But then I remembered how much of Middle Earth PJ was planning to put into this,  so I forced myself to stop looking for mistakes and judge the movie for what it is.  And you know what?  Not only did I enjoy the movie,  but I wanted more.I know a lot of you think that expanding the movie was just a money grab,  but I think you're forgetting something. That Something being that Peter Jackson is GEEK.  100%,  unadulterated Geek.  Can you guess the movies target audience?  If you guessed ""Geeks"",  give yourself a cookie.  I guarantee you that had The Hobbit been created BEFORE the Lord of The Rings trilogy,  we would have had a more ""faithful"" adaptation. I will agree that he made an error in making LOTR first.  It set the bar far too high,  and the Hobbit,  while wonderful all on its own,  could not rise to the challenge of satisfying an army of salivating Tolkien geeks.  It just couldn't  It would only serve to whet their appetites.Many also criticize the tone of the movie,  or rather the lack of  steadiness of it.  That's one of the few things that stayed true the book!!  Tolkien himself made the book with light hearted, childish and immature moments,  and then threw in some pretty mature,  scary,  sad,  even gruesome moments.  I remember being taken off guard the first time I read it and didn't know what to think.  But I believe it's one of the things that made The Hobbit such a classic in the first place.All that said,  I will admit that this movie is flawed and I didn't appreciate all the changes,  such as tweaking the Troll scene,  how Thorin was so whiny,  or  the fact that their mission changed from simple greed to the more noble ""taking back the homeland"" clich&eacute;.  But through it all the spirit of The Hobbit stayed the same,  and I loved every minute of it.  I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug!!!---------edit:  Just showed this movie to my four hyper-active no attention span nieces and nephews,  Ages 11-6 years old.  Not only did they sit through it,  but the 10 year old said ""It's the best show I ever saw!""  I was not expecting that.  I guess this movie reaches a larger demographic then I originally thought!",5,The Hobbit:  Why Peter Jackson couldn't win.,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,2573,"['wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'review', 'as', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'explanation', 'why', 'critics', 'are', 'wrong.Critics', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'expanded', 'THREE', 'MOVIES', 'Did', 'actually', 'come', 'expecting', 'see', 'Hobbit', 'alone', 'Well', 'did', 'was', 'mistake', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'theaters', 'too', 'was', 'doing', 'whole', 'not', 'how', 'did', 'book', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'different', 'then', 'remembered', 'how', 'much', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'PJ', 'was', 'planning', 'put', 'forced', 'stop', 'looking', 'mistakes', 'judge', 'movie', 'what', 'know', 'what', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'wanted', 'more.I', 'know', 'lot', 'think', 'expanding', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'money', 'grab', 'think', ""'re"", 'forgetting', 'something', 'Something', 'being', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'GEEK', '100', '%', 'unadulterated', 'Geek', 'Can', 'guess', 'movies', 'target', 'audience', 'guessed', 'Geeks', 'give', 'cookie', 'guarantee', 'had', 'Hobbit', 'been', 'created', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'will', 'agree', 'made', 'error', 'making', 'LOTR', 'first', 'set', 'bar', 'far', 'too', 'high', 'Hobbit', 'wonderful', 'own', 'could', 'not', 'rise', 'challenge', 'satisfying', 'army', 'salivating', 'Tolkien', 'geeks', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', 'only', 'serve', 'whet', 'appetites.Many', 'also', 'criticize', 'tone', 'movie', 'rather', 'lack', 'steadiness', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'stayed', 'true', 'book', 'Tolkien', 'made', 'book', 'light', 'hearted', 'childish', 'immature', 'moments', 'then', 'threw', 'pretty', 'mature', 'scary', 'sad', 'even', 'gruesome', 'moments', 'remember', 'being', 'taken', 'off', 'guard', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'believe', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'Hobbit', 'such', 'classic', 'first', 'place.All', 'said', 'will', 'admit', 'movie', 'flawed', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'changes', 'such', 'tweaking', 'Troll', 'scene', 'how', 'Thorin', 'was', 'so', 'whiny', 'fact', 'mission', 'changed', 'simple', 'greed', 'more', 'noble', 'taking', 'back', 'homeland', 'clich', 'eacute', 'spirit', 'Hobbit', 'stayed', 'same', 'loved', 'minute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Desolation', 'Smaug', '-edit', 'Just', 'showed', 'movie', 'four', 'hyper-active', 'attention', 'span', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'Ages', '11-6', 'years', 'old', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'sit', '10', 'year', 'old', 'said', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'guess', 'movie', 'larger', 'demographic', 'then', 'originally', 'thought']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

1449846,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B0059XTU1S,taaj,"[5, 13]","I am not a huge Tolkein fan or Jackson fan. I didn't read the book and only saw LOTR twice in the last ten years, so this is a Jane Q. Public point of view.My first impression of the movie was that it was beautiful. The settings are eye popping, lush, interesting, well lit, well costumed, and over all well done. Each scene looks like a piece of art. The colors found in the movie aren't found in nature. They are crafted to set a tone. The effect is beautiful, but not at all lifelike. But it's a fantasy, right? So who cares?Then you sink into the story and realize that there isn't that much of it. There are a LOT of characters. With the exception of Bilbo, Galdalf, and Gollum, they have very few lines so you don't get much of a sense of who they are. There is no reason to root for them or care about their journey. There is a lot of fighting, running, and more fighting. Not a whole lot actually happens in almost 3 hours.I had heard that the book is fully of singing and silly dwarfs. This isn't really portrayed in the movie. I was hoping it would be. There is a scene where they are in Bilbo's house where they sing and are goofy, but then they aren't. They were rude, loud, and ill-mannered before that and fighting after that, so it seems disjointed.Not being a hard core fan or purist, I liked the inclusion of the people from LOTRs. I thought it gave the stories connection and continuity, but that was also a con. I thought the two were too much alike. They looked alike, the action was similar, the characters were similar. It felt like watching LOTR all over again. I realize that that will be a plus for some people though.Is the CGI overdone? I have no idea. I thought it all looked fine and realistic. Is the 48 FPS a hit? Again, I couldn't tell you. The outside scenes look realer than real. You can almost see each blade of grass and wouldn't be surprised if the wind hit your face. But, there are times when the movement happens too fast for my eyes to see. I wouldn't say it's blurry exactly, but it looks different in an ineffective way.All in all, it was okay. I watched some of the ""making of"" shorts that Jackson put out as they were in production. I wanted to love it. I wanted it to live up to its hype, but after seeing it, I can see why it wasn't nominated for awards the way LOTR was. It wasn't horrible. I don't think anyone will hate it, but it's probably more of a thrill for Tolkein fans.UPDATE: The DVD improves with viewing. The first time I noticed the stellar acting from Serkis and the Freeman in particular. I noticed the scenery and visual beauty. The second time I was already familiar with that and could focus on the story. Not a lot happens, but having a story makes everything else that happens more enjoyable. It's still long, but hearing Richard Armitage sing the Misty Mountain song is a good way to kick off an adventure.",3,Been There Done That,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,2876,"['am', 'not', 'huge', 'Tolkein', 'fan', 'Jackson', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'only', 'saw', 'LOTR', 'twice', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'Jane', 'Q', 'Public', 'point', 'view.My', 'first', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'are', 'eye', 'popping', 'lush', 'interesting', 'well', 'lit', 'well', 'costumed', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'piece', 'art', 'colors', 'found', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'found', 'nature', 'are', 'crafted', 'set', 'tone', 'effect', 'beautiful', 'not', 'lifelike', 'fantasy', 'right', 'So', 'who', 'Then', 'sink', 'story', 'realize', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'are', 'LOT', 'characters', 'exception', 'Bilbo', 'Galdalf', 'Gollum', 'have', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sense', 'who', 'are', 'reason', 'root', 'care', 'journey', 'lot', 'fighting', 'running', 'more', 'fighting', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'actually', 'almost', '3', 'hours.I', 'had', 'heard', 'book', 'fully', 'singing', 'silly', 'dwarfs', ""n't"", 'really', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'Bilbo', 'house', 'where', 'sing', 'are', 'goofy', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'were', 'rude', 'loud', 'ill-mannered', 'fighting', 'disjointed.Not', 'being', 'hard', 'core', 'fan', 'purist', 'liked', 'inclusion', 'people', 'LOTRs', 'thought', 'gave', 'stories', 'connection', 'continuity', 'was', 'also', 'con', 'thought', 'two', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'alike', 'looked', 'alike', 'action', 'was', 'similar', 'characters', 'were', 'similar', 'felt', 'watching', 'LOTR', 'over', 'again', 'realize', 'will', 'be', 'plus', 'people', 'though.Is', 'CGI', 'overdone', 'have', 'idea', 'thought', 'looked', 'fine', 'realistic', '48', 'FPS', 'hit', 'Again', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'outside', 'scenes', 'look', 'realer', 'real', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'blade', 'grass', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'wind', 'hit', 'face', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movement', 'too', 'fast', 'eyes', 'see', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'blurry', 'exactly', 'different', 'ineffective', 'way.All', 'was', 'okay', 'watched', 'making', 'shorts', 'Jackson', 'put', 'out', 'were', 'production', 'wanted', 'love', 'wanted', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'seeing', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'awards', 'way', 'LOTR', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'hate', 'probably', 'more', 'thrill', 'Tolkein', 'fans.UPDATE', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'noticed', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Serkis', 'Freeman', 'particular', 'noticed', 'scenery', 'visual', 'beauty', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'could', 'focus', 'story', 'Not', 'lot', 'having', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'long', 'hearing', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'sing', 'Misty', 'Mountain', 'song', 'good', 'way', 'kick', 'off', 'adventure']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

There are a lot of things that disappointed me. The one that got me the most was the way they did the character thorn. He didn't have a large nose or even a decent beard. His face looked too human. He didn't talk like you would expect from a dwarf.like a lot of the dwarves he also wasn't squatty looking just like short humans. Also with the character bilbo they seemed to stray from the book. Hobbits aren't completely helpless they can move quickly and quietly and aren't stupid. I also hated how most of the movie they treated him as an outcast while in the book he was truly part of the company. And wasn't always quiet in the back. he was a part of the adventure and there was hardly ever a word about bilbo not being able to fulfill his agreement. And hobbits are shorter than dwarves and chubbier with furry feet not just giant awkward feet with a little hair growing out of them. They also removed the fact that eagles talked to them after they were saved I'm worried they will do the same with smaug and the talk he and bilbo had was an interesting part of the book. And in the next movie the spiders talk while bilbo listens to what they plan to do with the dwarves. Plus the white Orc had nothing to do with the book but I'll admit that was a nice touch.

Suffice it to say, any movie based off a book is much better enjoyed and appreciated to the fullest if the book is read first.  Some of the negative reviews I've heard about the movie are comments related to content in the movie not found in the book, and while that may be slightly true, it does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.Blu Ray DVDs have come a long way from their start and I am happy to see that these DVDs have fast start to watch time (after short data load) and I can now pause the movie and can resume at the same exact point where I stopped previously.  This may have more to do with your DVD hardware capabilities (I use a PS3) but just the same a very nice feature.  The quality of the DVDs are excellent and the menus easy to navigate.  I have not yet explored the bonus disks and the 3D disks would not display on my TV.  I think its probably due to a software update needed for my TV which I have not taken the time to upgrade.  Not being a huge 3D fan anyway, it hasn't been a priority.  The sound quality is DTS and is very good.  And yes, I wish the DVD contained the extended version of the movie as I'm sure I will purchase that too when it comes out later.As a huge fan of the Tolkien books and the Jackson Lord of the Rings movies, I found the content of the story line to be accurate and true to the book with an occasional extravagance thrown in by Jackson.  It will be important to remember that the story still has two parts to go and the final judgment of the presentation should be reserved until the entire story is presented.

1449874,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B0059XTU1S,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","After Peter Jackson's multi-oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, skepticism was voiced about how he might expand Tolkien's earlier and slimmer 1937-published prequel into three full-length films, and the original idea was a 2-part `Hobbit'. If the first installment is indicative of the overall standard of the forthcoming trilogy, we needn't worry: the Kiwi with the golden touch has pulled it off again.Tolkien's dwarves are a grudge-bearing, avaricious but tirelessly industrious race who create great underground kingdoms to mine Middle Earth's riches, with a history of cool relations with other races (especially the elves) but ultimately `good guys'. `The Hobbit' concerns the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's bachelor-uncle and a reluctant participant in a quest with 13 dwarves led by the redoubtable Thorin Oakenshield (played here by a brooding and rage-driven Richard Armitage) to recover their distant `Kingdom under the Mountain' for several years occupied by the fire-breathing dragon Smaug.In similar style to the `Fellowship of the Ring' Jackson's new epic opens by offering the audience a brief dramatized history lesson of the dragon's assault on the Kingdom under the Mountain & what became of the dwarves after their exile. Then we pan to the quiet pastoral life of Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole, some 60 years before handing over `the ring' to nephew Frodo, and the arrival of the 13 uninvited dwarves who proceed to eat him out of house & home. The superb Ian McKellen (in a role he was surely born to play) once again presides as Gandalf, who has convinced the dwarves that they need Bilbo as a burglar to succeed on their mission because the dragon can smell dwarves a mile away but doesn't know the smell of hobbits.Martin Freeman is an unexpectedly excellent Bilbo, a more complex and less instantly-likeable character than Elijah Wood's shining & heroic Frodo. Other characters from Jackson's LotR trilogy appear briefly to tie this prequel in to the later epic: Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) & Saruman (Christopher Lee) reprise their roles in a mini-replay of the council at Elrond's house; a scene recorded in Tolkien's historical notes but not in the original published `The Hobbit' and inserted here to offer the audience link to the follow-up LotR in describing the revival of Sauron.The seamless integration of up-to-the-minute CGI with live actors is again a big feature, endowing the action with often breath-taking realism. The scene with three mountain trolls (played as dwarf-roasting gourmets with cockney accents!) straight from Tolkien's original text is a fine example; the giant figures mix-in seamlessly with the small, creating a real-imaginary world of astonishing detail. The villains of the piece are the dwarf-hating, warg-riding orcs, a personal vendetta between orc-chief Azog (played to perfection by a malice-oozing Manu Bennett) & Thorin realized in grisly detail and justifying the film's not-for-unaccompanied-children rating. Andy Serkis reprises his starring role from LotR with a masterful performance as the CGI-enhanced Gollum in Tolkien's `riddles in the dark' chapter. This is the film's key scene, dramatic tension revealing the pathos & complexity of the character as the `one ring' chooses its new bearer and firmly ties the narrative in to the LotR trilogy.Peter Jackson is revealed once again as the undisputed master of bringing Tolkien to the big screen. A more linear tale than the multiply sub-plotted LotR and with fewer characters, Jackson's adapted screenplay for `The Hobbit' remains faithful to Tolkien's original tale and offers us a great cinematic experience. The script is intelligent, the continuity & pacing superb, the action sequences edge-of-seat gripping - though there might be a bit too much frantic chase-movie screen time & too many cliff-hangers for some viewers. The panoramic NZ South-Island locations are sumptuous, with distance shots of tiny figures in huge natural landscapes & soaring snow-clad mountains complete with cascading waterfalls. There is light & shade, even humor to a level of slapstick worthy of circus-clowns in the precipitous underground goblin-kingdom scenes dominated by a brilliant performance from the heavily-disguised Barry Humphries.The DVD release is region-free. The 3D adds a lot to the experience, and can be recommended unreservedly.It looks like Jackson and his team have raised the bar again and might have another cinematic triumph on their hands.",4,Peter

It incorporates many of the same characters, sets, and sound track.LOTR was arguably the best film(s) ever made. No one expected this from Peter Jackson, whose films before and since have left little to rave about. There were scenes where I felt Jackson was resting on his laurels, not wanting to do a second take, while there were other scenes which left me breathless.In case you didn't realize it, this is a prequel to LOTR. In this story a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the slobbish Dwarves regain their mountain taken by a dragon. In this episode, Bilbo acquires his sword ""Sting"" and ""The Ring."" They do not reach the mountain.Gandalf appears to be our only source for truisms and memorable lines. ""Your house is now behind you, the world is ahead."" or ""Evil will always look for a foothold in the world"" or ""True courage is not knowing when to take a life, but when to spare one."" This written with WWII in the mind of Tolkien. I couldn't help but think of the dragon as Germany or of the Elves appeasement philosophy that the world was at peace while battles raged on.The only real question is to watch it in 3D IMAX or the regular screen. As a fan I thought the headache from the 3D IMAX was worth every penny. However there were only a few scenes where I thought the 3D really ""made it."" You won't be too cheated watching it in 2D.Martin Freeman has a very strong British accent, unlike the other Hobbits. Initially I thought his character was a weak link, similar to Elijah Wood as Frodo. He grew stronger in his role as the film progressed, although I am not convinced he was the best choice.Sylvester McCoy plays Radagast, the Brown. He is a wizard Peter Jackson cut out of the original screenplay for ""The Fellowship of the Rings."" The 90 year old Christopher Lee returns to his role as does Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Andy Serkis, and Hugo Weaving.A worthy effort.",5,I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SHARE IN AN ADVENTURE,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,1973,"['LOTR', 'series', 'set', 'template', 'film', 'many', 'same', 'characters', 'sets', 'sound', 'track.LOTR', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'film', 's', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'expected', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'films', 'have', 'left', 'little', 'rave', 'about', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'felt', 'Jackson', 'was', 'resting', 'laurels', 'not', 'wanting', 'do', 'second', 'take', 'were', 'other', 'scenes', 'left', 'breathless.In', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'prequel', 'LOTR', 'story', 'younger', 'Bilbo', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Gandalf', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'slobbish', 'Dwarves', 'regain', 'mountain', 'taken', 'dragon', 'episode', 'Bilbo', 'sword', 'Sting', 'Ring', 'do', 'not', 'reach', 'mountain.Gandalf', 'be', 'only', 'source', 'truisms', 'memorable', 'lines', 'house', 'now', 'world', 'ahead', 'Evil', 'will', 'always', 'look', 'foothold', 'world', 'True', 'courage', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'take', 'life', 'when', 'spare', 'one', 'written', 'WWII', 'mind', 'Tolkien', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'dragon', 'Germany', 'Elves', 'appeasement', 'philosophy', 'world', 'was', 'peace', 'battles', 'raged', 'only', 'real', 'question', 'watch', '3D', 'IMAX', 'regular', 'screen', 'fan', 'thought', 'headache', '3D', 'IMAX', 'was', 'worth', 'penny', 'However', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'thought', '3D', 'really', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'cheated', 'watching', '2D.Martin', 'Freeman', 'very', 'strong', 'British', 'accent', 'other', 'Hobbits', 'Initially', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'weak', 'link', 'similar', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Frodo', 'grew', 'stronger', 'role', 'film', 'progressed', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'was', 'best', 'choice.Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Radagast', 'Brown', 'wizard', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'cut', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Fellowship', 'Rings', '90', 'year', 'old', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'role', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Hugo', 'Weaving.A', 'worthy', 'effort']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Taking place 60 years before the events in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it follows the adventures of young hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who's recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to help a gang of rowdy dwarves reclaim their mountain home.Jackson's plan to break down ""The Hobbit"" into three feature-film installments may tax the patience of his core audience.  The first hour plays very much like a kids' flick. Though the movie does turn darker and more dramatic, the director veers considerably from the well known book in an attempt to add spectacle and endow some characters with loftier motives than Tolkien envisioned.  As in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, the cinematography and production design are impressive, but the running time makes this fantasy a long slog.A deluxe five-disc edition contains Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD, and Digital Copy.  Bonus extras include Jackson's making-of production videos; featurettes on the start of production, location scouting, and filming in 3D; post-production overview; and footage of the world premiere in Wellington, New Zealand.

1449879,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B0059XTU1S,The People's Critic,"[5, 9]","There was once a beloved trilogy. One day, its creator decided a series of prequels were in order, so he directed...Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. Thus was born mankind's apprehension and speculation over prequel trilogies. A case is yet to be made for why Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit requires three parts. Nonetheless, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good film...whew, what a relief!The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes place sixty years before Frodo takes his first step towards Mordor. The story is simple this time around, as we return to Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is persuaded, or rather coerced, by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to assist a party of 13 dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost kingdom. Freeman is very effective as the neurotic, Woody Allen-esque, Bilbo. His nuanced touch to the role gives the audience a very likable and enjoyable central character arch that is only accentuated by our familiarity with him from Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings films. McKellen slips seamlessly back into his gray robes as Gandalf. While Gandalf is always wise and sensible, McKellen portrays him here as slightly less ""urgent"" given the lessened threat to Middle Earth and existence that occurs in The Hobbit. This lack of urgency translates to the entire film, which may disappoint die-hard Rings fans. There are more scenes in the ""silly"" category here than in the previous trilogy. Additionally, there is simply a lowered sense of critical doom and immediacy in this storyline. The film's opening scenes go on for quite a while and while enjoyable, the end result is a slightly bloated film.These criticisms are certainly legitimate, but they are truly its only faults. The film looks beautiful and lives up to what one would expect from Jackson's take on the Tolkien mythology; New Zealand should probably be nominated for best supporting actor. The adaptation of Tolkien's book is developed in such a way that it will lead up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy very nicely. Familiar characters appear along the way, and they are not unnecessary or false. All of them further the story and add something to the film, which is a credit to the host of screenwriters including Guillermo del Toro and Jackson himself. Furthermore, the dwarf plotline is elevated from the childish mood reflected in the novel to one that feels a bit more mature. This is a good decision and while younger kids can enjoy this film (if they have a long attention span), it is clear that the Hobbit films look to maintain a similar tone to the previous films in the series. At the end, there is quite a bit to like about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While it lacks the epic quality and complex narrative of The Lord of the Rings films, the groundwork is set for an excellent companion trilogy that is fun, technically impressive, and brilliantly respectful to fans and film lovers.

Thankfully Jackson didn't follow the typical Hollywood paradigm of taking it ""to a whole new level"" with a sequel (technically a prequel in this case) because the story is smaller in scale than LOTR and should be that way.  From An Unexpected Party with the stirring song about the dwarven homeland, Bilbo's reluctance and sense of loss as he rushes out of his comfortable home without even a handkerchief.  The terrifying episode of Roast mutton as Bilbo begins to prove his worth against the Trolls to the titanic battle in the mountains followed by A Short Rest and the arrival at the last homely house.  All building up to Riddles in the Dark with the danger and creepiness of Gollum's cave coupled with the daring escape and finally the breathtaking cliffhanger of Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire and a logical ending to Part One.It's difficult to go wrong when you've got a cast starring Ian McKellenMacbeth / McKellen, Dench (Thames Shakespeare Collection)returning as Gandalf the wandering wizard, supplemented with an excellent performance by Martin FreemanSherlock: Season Oneas Bilbo Baggins as well as Richard ArmitageRobin Hood: Season Oneplaying Thorin Oakenshield not to mention Sylvester McCoy as Radaghast the Brown,  Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and on and on.

The Goblin King was kind of funny and seems to be accurately translated from the book.The films are fun as far as they go but I would recommend reading the books as well so JRRTs whole intent can be appreciated.At least these versions of The Hobbit and LOTRs are superior than the crap from Ralph Bakshi and that fact alone adds a star to my reviewA final comment:Galadriel wasnt present in The Hobbit but shes in the films as being played by Cate Blanchett .A film could made made of this woman just being willowy ,gracefull and elf like and I would pay to see it......twice!!!  :D !!!",4,Its neat but it isnt really The Hobbit,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1303,"['watched', 'films', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'how', 'awesome', 'LOOK', 'arent', 'accurate', 'representatives', 'Hobbit.Fleshing', 'story', 'make', 'three', 'films', 'ambitious', 'doing', 'LOT', 'flavor', 'book', 'recall', 'basically', 'childrens', 'story', 'proceed', 'details', 'may', 'be', 'spoilery', 'so', 'wont', 'save', 'say', 'interesting', 'link', 'story', 'Hobbit', 'story', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'what', 'worth', 'Hobbits', 'story', 'finding', 'One', 'Ring', 'nothing', 'do', 'LOTRs', '.At', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'remember', 'been', 'decades', 'last', 'read', 'Hobbit', 'violent', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'top', 'Goblin', 'King', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'be', 'accurately', 'translated', 'book.The', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'as', 'far', 'go', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'books', 'well', 'JRRTs', 'whole', 'intent', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated.At', 'least', 'versions', 'Hobbit', 'LOTRs', 'are', 'superior', 'crap', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'fact', 'alone', 'star', 'reviewA', 'final', 'comment', 'Galadriel', 'wasnt', 'present', 'Hobbit', 'shes', 'films', 'being', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', '.A', 'film', 'could', 'made', 'made', 'woman', 'just', 'being', 'willowy', 'gracefull', 'elf', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'twice', 'D']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

But Peter Jackson's last foray into Middle Earth, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was based on three pretty substantial books. Initially, ""The Hobbit"" was designed as two films, but Warner Bros. persuaded Jackson to expand it to a trilogy. So, a recap: ""Lord of the Rings"" is based on three books. One film, per book, more or less. ""The Hobbit"" is based on one book. How do you take material for two films and make it three? ""The Lord of the Rings"" was released on DVD at least three separate times, each with more footage added to the ""Director's Cut"". It would seem a safe bet to conclude the three films are being bulked up by this ""Special Footage"". But if the footage was deemed extra and cut out of the film in the first place, there was a reason for that. Generally, footage is cut because it slows down the story or is deemed superfluous. But in an effort to wring an extra $13 out of loyal fans, Warner Bros. will release one part of the trilogy each December for three years, guaranteeing a certain level of hype and income to their studio coffers. And the fan who watches ""The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey"" is treated to an almost leisurely look at Bilbo Baggins adventure with Gandalf the Grey and Thorin, the King of the Dwarves.If all three films have approximately the same running time, fans can expect a very leisurely journey indeed. Between eight and nine hours' worth of time in Middle Earth.The real trick is for Jackson to make three films, using footage that was cut and would have been included on the ""Super Special Absolutely Final Director's Cut Special Edition"" DVD and make the film seem like the original story was not changed at all. In ""Journey"" that isn't accomplished; it seems long. Would the initial dinner at Bilbo's house, when Gandalf introduces all of the dwarves, suffered from losing 15 minutes? I doubt it. This is just one example of a scene that is too long and there are others.If the original plans to present two films remained intact, I have no doubt this film would have benefited greatly. But Warner Bros. decision to capitalize on a name brand and eke out an extra film will mar the entire series. I picture some executive at the studio is in his cave, covered with gold coins, rearing his head only to protect the fortune from pillage.Jackson decided to shoot the film at a higher frame rate than normal. And the film is presented in the now obligatory 3-D (all the better to eke out $3 from each patron). The standard for film is 24 frames per second. For video, in this country, it is 30. This is why television looks so different from film and vice versa. I revel in the look of a beautifully photographed film. There is nothing quite like it and it helps to transport me to the fictional world the filmmaker is trying to create. And video has advanced considerably in the last few years.I really admire filmmakers who try to push the envelope and come up with new techniques for or methods of filmmaking. And these experimental efforts are necessary because they keep pushing the medium forward, but if you look back at the early attempts of a new technique you can usually see where a technique started because it looks so rudimentary, so different. The High Frame Rate used in ""The Hobbit"" looks good and bad. When the film centers on a computer generated character or landscape, the HFR (High Frame Rate) adds an amazing layer of depth and when viewed in 3-D, the results are stunning; you feel as though you are looking through a window. That barrier between you and the film is removed and you really experience a new way of watching film.But is this a good thing? Do you want to have that barrier removed? It is a bit strange and unsettling.When the film concentrates solely on characters played by human beings, the HFR makes the characters and landscapes look like an old video television show. Have you ever seen an old television show, from the 60s or 70s, using the relatively new medium of video? They look strange and oft-putting because the color is over-saturated and slightly off. Some of the footage in ""The Hobbit"" looks like this. Maybe over time, as we get acclimated to this new look, the technique will become better and more acceptable. But right now, because it works 50% of the time, it seems to be more of a distraction.The best thing I can say about this new technique is that my eyes were less tired after watching this film in 3-D.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a mixed bag. The excessive length and decision to make three films out of material already stretched to make two mar one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Jackson's attempts to use a new filming technique show some promise, but the effect is too jarring at this point. The actors are all good, the special effects are fun and well-made, the landscapes lush and gorgeous.But watching ""Journey"" feels like you are physically walking the journey with Bilbo and Gandalf.

I think the plot in this film did not have the same depth as the Lord of the Ring movie, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it.I haven't read ""The Hobbit"" yet, so I can't compare the film to the book.

1449902,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B0059XTU1S,Tim,"[2, 3]","There's been a lot of criticism towards this movie; most of which springing forth from the fact that many feel it shouldn't be split into three films. I'm actually in the group who, before the film, felt like three films was ridiculous. After watch the first in Jackson's trilogy, I will grudgingly say I'm okay with it now.Here's where I'm coming from. The Hobbit, simply put, could not make three films on its own. Adding the elements from Tolkien's other works though, that makes for a way to increase time and, this is the part where I think many will disagree with me, will help pacing. Yeah, I know, I'll be the first to say that this movie feels too long (not interested in an extended edition this time, thank you. This would be fine by itself.) but the very nature of The Hobbit is a quest novel. There's a lot of traveling from place to place and getting into adventures along the way. The added benefit of the Necromancer plotline in the upcoming films, should actually make the pacing better. We'll have less jumping from moment to moment and more of a focus on two specific goals (Goal 1: the 14 going for the gold/Goal 2: the wizards fighting the necromancer) which can interact with each other. As of my writing this, neither of the later two Hobbit movies are out, so I'm just offering a hopeful note of possible way for the series to go.Onto the Blu-ray, the picture is wonderful, the special features are lighter than I would like, but more than I expected. Those of you waiting for the extended edition will no doubt see more when it arrives. The 3D is very good. This is the sort of 3D that doesn't pop out at you with gimmicks, but the sort that helps build the world by creating more depth. It's not the most impressive to look at, but it does add another visual layer to the film. (NOTE: the 3D version is split across two discs, so those of you not wanting to get out of your chair for an intermission may want to stick with the 2D.)All in all, I enjoyed The Hobbit. It has its faults, it's overlong, but it's enjoyable.

1449903,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0059XTU1S,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","Fans of Peter Jackson&#8217;s Lord of the Rings trilogy know you never buy the films upon initial DVD or Blu-ray release because there will be an extended edition that follows.  The extended edition of The Hobbit checks in at a mere 182 minutes, 13 minutes longer than the theatrical cuts while the LOTR&#8217;s extended cuts were 30 &#8211; 45 minutes longer in length.  Of course, a lot of people may say that an extended edition is totally unnecessary considering a single novel (and a relatively short one at that) is being stretched into a trilogy.  Unlike the LOTR&#8217;s extended editions which add important elements to the film, such as the parlay with the Mouth of Sauron before the gates of Mordor, the additional scenes are more like the garnish on the dinner plate.  They might make it look pretty but ultimately you toss them aside.I&#8217;m not going to go into many details and analysis of the film itself.  Yes it&#8217;s a highly padded version of Tolkien&#8217;s novel but the film adds elements and plotlines from The Lord of the Rings that didn&#8217;t appear in those films.  Radagast the Brown who was barely mentioned in the Hobbit and the LOTR&#8217;s plays a much larger role in the film.  In Middle Earth history it was Gandalf that investigated the abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur, in the film it is instead Radagast that discovers the fortress is inhabited by a Necromancer, i.e. Sauron.So with that said, lets quickly cover some (but not all) of the additional and extended scenes that comprise the extra 13 minutes:- Peter Jackson&#8217;s daughter Katie plays a hobbit, along with the film&#8217;s production designer Dan Hennah as Old Took. It&#8217;s also in this scene that we see a four-year old Bilbo playing with Gandalf as he releases his famous fireworks.- More footage of Bilbo in the Shire prior to the Dwarves arrival.- We get more footage of the Dwarves raiding Bilbo&#8217;s pantry- Additional footage of the dwarves feasting in Rivendell as a beautiful Elf maiden plays a harp.- Additional footage of Gandalf and Elrond discussing how Gandalf found the sword Glamdring and of a Dwarves singing a lively song- Bilbo overhears a conversation between Gandalf and Elrond in Rivendell discussing their quest.  Maybe the most important of the additional scenes.- Another important scene between Gandalf, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman discussing the fate of the seven rings of power that were given to the Dwarves.- After being captured by the Goblins, its discovered that the dwarf Nori stole several items from the elves in Rivendell including a candelabra that the Goblin King finds and discards.ExtrasNo one does extras like Peter Jackson and the Extended Edition Blu-Ray is filled with over eight hours of new material.Audio Commentary by Peter Jackson and Co-Writer Philippa BoyensNew

1449909,A3LOWL6EULTTQ4,B0059XTU1S,T. Iverson,"[0, 0]","I'll be honest and say I went into this with lower expectations than I did with LOTR, worried that it would come across as a re-hash of the Lord of the Rings movies. Thankfully it didn't, The Hobbit does indeed stand on its own, thanks mostly to a fantastic lead performance from Martin Freeman who is perfect as Bilbo Baggins. Unfortunately, what I didn't like was the slow, song-filled first 90 minutes. Okay, so ""song-filled"" is a slight exaggeration, there are only two songs... but for a fantasy epic, that's two songs too many! It took far too long for them to begin their quest, and when they did there were moments (like the troll scene) that I didn't think added anything to the plot or characters. I read somewhere that there were supposed to be only 2 movies in this saga, but they had so much footage they decided to turn it into three movies.

1449918,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0059XTU1S,Todd Smith,"[4, 8]","Going into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I knew that it was a tale originally written for children, but the Lord of The Rings trilogy was so well done, that I fully expected the first Hobbit movie to be just as masterful. It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird s***. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1988,"['Going', 'Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'knew', 'was', 'tale', 'originally', 'written', 'children', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'fully', 'expected', 'first', 'Hobbit', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'masterful', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'luster', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'had', 'trilogy', 'was', 'magical', 'reason', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'Hobbit', 'seemed', 'be', 'playing', 'off', 'fame', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'times', 'was', 'directionless', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'tell', 'tale', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'original', 'journey', 'Gandalf', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'go', 'impossible', 'journey', 'order', 'save', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'here', 'journey', 'saving', 'dwarfs', 'gold', 'dragon', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'intensity', 'urgency', 'require', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Nothing', 'had', 'changed', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'sudden', 'now', 'time', 'stop', 'dragon', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'great', 'adventure', 'could', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'childish', 'elements', 'PG-13', 'film', 'fighting', 'beheadings', 'also', 'film', 'singing', 'dwarfs', 'drunk', 'gnomes', 'wizard', 'Alzheimer', 'who', 'covered', 'bird', 's***', 'feel', 'things', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Gandalf', 'finally', 'seemed', 'be', 'showing', 'age', 'McKellen', 'tired', 'slow', 'film', 'Gandalf', 'not', 'same', 'great', 'warrior', 'Finally', 'film', 'different', 'know', 'prequel', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'taking', 'major', 'play', 'away', 'screenwriters', 'Hobbit', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'not', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'directionless', 'times', 'urgency', 'needed', 'epic', 'cast', 'really', ""n't"", 'excite', 'was', 'hoping', 'lot', 'got', 'was', 'little', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'now', 'try', 'forget', 'about', 'wait', 'next', 'film', 'anticipation']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

The film's tone and production style seamlessly meshes with that of  the LOTR trilogy, and the returning cast make their characters feel every bit as real and alive as they did before.  The newcomers jump right into the mix without hesitation and succeed at every turn.  Martin Freeman is quaint and enjoyable as Bilbo, although I have to say he made the film seem almost British in a contemporary way at the very beginning of the film, just because of what I'm used to seeing him in.  Richard Armitage as Thorin exudes kingly strength and dignity in a way I have seldom seen from an actor.  I had not seen him in a film before, and I came away very impressed with him. There are so many other dwarves, all with copious facial hair, its hard to choose standouts, but they all seem to have a moment to shine.The special effects are predictably fantastic and amazing.  I've heard much grumbling about the CGI in The Hobbit and I do not understand why.  It's a fantasy movie, made in 2012.  Are you surprised there is CGI in abundance?  People act like they would have preferred the production team to use a horde of Jim Henson puppets or claymation models so the enemies would seem more ""substantial"".  I don't think so.  CGI is better than ever. Fantasy and Sci-Fi movies benefit far more from it than not, and the people who deny this most vehemently seem to do so out of an egotistical desire to be seen as insightful and wise, while simultaneously falling into the ideological trap of  ""traditional is always superior.""  Ok, enough polemical rambling.It's been a long time since I read the Hobbit (back in my Middle School days), so I can't really speak to the faithfulness of the adaption; but as an LOTR fan, I loved the Hobbit and was excited to be back in Middle-Earth once again.  Even after the long hiatus on production, and even after the general confusion of the project's long history, somehow The Hobbit came out as good as a film could be under so much creative stress and under all the pressure that hype can bring to bear on such projects.

Tolkien with ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga. It is safe to say his new film is visually impressive like the previous trilogy, but the film's deliberately paced story, especially its opening 40 minutes, will test the patience of some viewers.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first installment of the new trilogy, is about Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, Dr. Watson of UK crime drama ""Sherlock"") and his adventure with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen reprising the role he played in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and a group of dwarves to reclaim their land and treasures taken by the dragon Smaug. The film takes too much time introducing the characters, but once they set out on their journey, the story gets faster and better with lots of special effects-laden action sequences.Some of the characters from the ""Lord of the Rings"" epic also appear in ""The Unexpected Journey,"" including Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Gollum (Andy Serkis), the latter with the Dark Lord Sauron's Ring that Bilbo gives Frodo in ""Fellowship of the Ring."" But you will notice the tone of ""The Hobbit"" is more light-hearted than that of the ""Lord of the Rings"" epic.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" if which story precedes that of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy by 60 years, is a journey to where we once visited about ten years ago.

1449943,A2360QQWTF969A,B0059XTU1S,Tuckerby,"[1, 1]","In Tolkien's own words, this is the ""story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. ""  This formula has delighted readers for decades, combining adventure with a story of personal growth.  Why would anyone tamper with such success by adding subplots that are not relevant and shift the focus away from the title character?  This isn't just a movie about how Bilbo became a hero and acquired a ring of power.  It's also about Thorin and the rise of Sauron.If you add an element to the plot, show how that element relates to the story.  Azog and his vendetta against Thorin do not contribute to the central quest motif, nor are they necessary for adding peril--the company already encounters numerous dangers along the way.  If Jackson is using the orc to show us something about Thorin's character, it's unclear what that is, and the flashback about Thorin's fight with Azog interrupts the flow of the main story.Tolkien mentions the Necromancer of Dol Guldur (I.e., Sauron) in the book, but chose not to discuss him or the workings of the White Council because these didn't bear on the story he was telling.  Neither do they relate in this movie, but are included presumably to make The Hobbit more of a prelude to Lord of the Rings.  Unfortunately, Jackson does not handle this addition deftly.  Radagast is the sort of character many find annoying.  Some reviewers have even dubbed him Jackson's Jar Jar Binks.  The meeting of the White Council, in which we might expect some compelling discussion, turns out to be a tepid exchange among characters who lack any real life.  Yes, Christopher Lee superbly conveys Saruman's arrogance and disdain, allowing Ian McKellan to make Gandalf appear a bumbler in contrast, but their exchanges lack any passion.  Cate Blanchett's Galadriel sounds like she's stoned, with her dreamy voice, and she wanders around the chamber as if in a daze, periodically whispering in Gandalf's mind.  Elrond briefly speaks out against disturbing the peace, but then is silent.  No one questions Saruman's opinion.  Where is the interesting discussion, the dissent, the persuasion, the emotion that would make this scene interesting?  What we get is ""I want to get rid of the dragon.  Don't ruin the peace.  I have proof from Radagast that evil things lurk in Dol Guldur.  The only evil things in Dol Guldur are the mushrooms Radagast's been eating.  Meeting adjourned."" Again, Jackson should have shown us a connection between the rising menace of Sauron and the expedition to Erebor.  At the council meeting, we could have learned that Gandalf was instructed to help the dwarves. The council knew Sauron had returned and didn't want him gaining Smaug's allegiance.  Saruman could have been presented as hiding his motives from the others, creating intrigue.But the movie suffers from more than just adding superfluous detail to an already sufficient and engaging story.  It also suffers from Jackson's penchant for extending scenes too long and including too many Pirates of the Caribbean-style gimmicks to the action.  The introduction alone is 13 minutes long, compared to the concise seven minute opening of ""Fellowship.""  Tighter editing throughout would have greatly improved the pace, the tension, and the impact of events.Perhaps the most unfortunate thing is that Martin Freeman's brilliant portrayal of Bilbo gets lost amidst all the extraneous detail and overblown action.Given that Jackson's bloated remake of ""King Kong"" flopped epically, you'd think he would have returned to the clear, crisp storytelling of 'Lord of the Rings' for ""The Hobbit.""

'An Unexpected Journey' makes us all feel young again as if reading the book for the first time. The film is much different from the LOTR and incorporates a lot of the light hearted elements in the original material. Songs from the book are sung, riddles are flung back and forth in Gollum's cave and yet there is a lot more than just what is taken from the book. With three films in total Peter Jackson turns this film into much more of an epic than it is. Adding from Tolkein's appendices, and adding much more foreshadowing to what will come eventually in the story. The film has some returning cast members such as Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis. Still, the new comers such as Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Richard Armatage as Thorin have filled the shoes of a whole new cast of Middle Earth characters.In Summation, the film does not reach the levels as the original trilogy, but then again it is the beginning of its own brand new trilogy. It is a lot of fun with some great moments and plenty of Middle Earth history you can sink your teeth into. Once the film ends all you can do is hold your head high in anticipation for the next part of this brand new adventure.",4,Back to Middle Earth (Part 1 of 3),1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,1733,"['years', 'waiting', 'nearly', 'entire', 'decade', 'one', 'greatest', 'trilogies', 'was', 'completed', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'directors', 'chair', 'back', 'more', 'simpler', 'time', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Hobbit', 'one', 'most', 'cherished', 'tales', 'Hobbit', 'named', 'Bilbo', 'wizard', 'named', 'Gandalf', 'band', '12', 'dwarfs', 'pay', 'visit', 'ask', 'join', 'quest', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'evil', 'dragon.This', 'was', 'film', 'LOTR', 'fans', 'were', 'waiting', 'yet', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'two', 'films', 'will', 'now', 'become', 'three', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'much', 'different', 'LOTR', 'lot', 'light', 'hearted', 'elements', 'original', 'material', 'Songs', 'book', 'are', 'sung', 'riddles', 'are', 'flung', 'back', 'forth', 'Gollum', 'cave', 'yet', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'taken', 'book', 'three', 'films', 'total', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'epic', 'Adding', 'Tolkein', 'appendices', 'adding', 'much', 'more', 'foreshadowing', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'eventually', 'story', 'film', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'such', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Still', 'new', 'comers', 'such', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Bilbo', 'Richard', 'Armatage', 'Thorin', 'have', 'filled', 'shoes', 'whole', 'new', 'cast', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'characters.In', 'Summation', 'film', 'not', 'reach', 'levels', 'original', 'trilogy', 'then', 'again', 'beginning', 'own', 'brand', 'new', 'trilogy', 'lot', 'fun', 'great', 'moments', 'plenty', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'history', 'can', 'sink', 'teeth', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'hold', 'head', 'high', 'anticipation', 'next', 'part', 'brand', 'new', 'adventure']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

Professor Tolkein did sell the rights to those books for 7.5% in the '60's. To this day the family has not received any money from LOTR and has filed suit against the production of, ""The Hobbit."" For the record when questioned about the trilogy ""Lord of The Rings,"" Christopher's reply was,``My own position is that `The Lord Of The Rings' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form.""""The Hobbit"" started out very well, with the unexpected party, and Gandalf volunteering Bilbo as the burglar [so as not to have ""13"" members in the group.]  The next day Gandalf shows up to remind Bilbo about his acceptance of the job then disappears[book]. Radagast The Brown was first mentioned in ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" [book] when Gandalf tells Saruman  he meet him and was told ""The Nine have left Minas Morgul."" And the Necromancer, and The Sorcerer of Dolguldur were both disguises of Sauron, before he was ready to start gathering power and rebuilding. (Sauron assumed form not that long relatively, after having the One Ring cut from his hand) This group of Orcs is an outright abomination-never existed. And if the great battle between the Dwarves and Orcs happened in the movie at Moria controlled by the Orcs.? Yet in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" they enter Moria expecting to be welcomed by-Dwarves? The time line is too short. After the first defeat of Sauron the Dwarves ruled Moria. But Thorin is fighting Azog there at a time when Dwarves should be ruling. After the Battle of the Five Armies Durin goes to Moria to restore it and hopefully find the Dwarven Ring of Power and his company awakens the Balrog, a Maiar or minor angel (of fire) as is Gandalf. This mess Jackson creates.Meeting the trolls Bert, Tom and William, Bilbo wants to show off to the Dwarves and tries picking William's pocket but he has a magic wallet that speaks up and he gets caught. As they are roasting meat, they don't eat him right away. Arguring what to do with him the Dwarves wander out and every one is caught and put in a sack, but Bilbo escapes. They argue and a mysterious voice eggs them on, finally saying,  ""Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!"" Except.....that's the BOOK and not the movie.There is no attack and chase or appearance by Radagast-they spent the night under the stars with the bread, cheese, and beer from the trolls along with looking at the swords. Next they show up at Rivendell not too comfortable because the two races don't get along well and Elrond tells them the swords are Elvish, made for the Goblin wars and when Thorin shows Elrond his map its under moonlight and  exposes moon-letters, special secret runes that say, ""Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole."" Durin is Thorin's first ancestor, and his Day is the first day of the dwarves' new year. But there's a problem: no one can calculate exactly when Durin's Day falls anymore. Elrond gives Thorin his map back. The next morning, Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves all set off for the Misty Mountains. Kind of tame by contrast with the movie.Jackson does a much better job with the rock giants, capture by the goblins and Goblin Town, its quite entertaining. Of course Bilbo finds the Ring [ something the Ring has not counted on] and his famous riddle game with Gollum was all played very straight.After they escape and run down by wargs and climb trees, Gandal grabs pine cones, uses magic to set them on fire and throws them among them wargs, many of which catch fire, run and set others on fire. The goblins arrive, look the situation over and start laughing and singing, ""15 birds in 5 fir trees"" all the while piling firey cones at the bases of the trees. And Gandalf and company are rescued by the Eagles, no Orcs or big battle.Do YOURSELF a favor and read the book, and see how the True Lord of Middle Earth wrote it.Its worth the effort.*As an aside Jackson is supposed to make another ""Lord of The Rings"" related movie, but I cannot figure out what it will be. Professor Tolkein did not sell the rights to the ""Silmarillion."" It took his son Christopher 20 years to put it together, well after his father's death, and its really a loose overview and HE owns the rights to the book.

I can appreciate that - the extra info, the necromancer, the elves trying to manipulate things behind dwarfs back etc.However I must stress out that the pace of the movie doesn't quite match. The things scroll along just too fast - the entire part of chasing through goblin caves is like a Roller-coaster ride that went just a bit too fast - in fact so fast that your vision begins to blur.

Villines ""WJ Villines""","[0, 2]","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Extended Edition (DVD +UltraViolet) (2013) (I made my purchase at a local target rather than Amazon.What you need to know -- the digital ""Ultra-violet"" is a very limited choice of options as you MUST have one of the digital provider proprietary systems such as Apple's iTunes and that means you can only access it via ""registered and approved devices"" and are limited to how many can access it -- you can't even buy a second license for it.It would be better to just buy the DVD set and do the digital yourself.Now to the Extended Version of the movie --- That is what raised my 3 stars to 5 -- the Extended Version makes the movie actually more enjoyable and much less choppy. Even the humor scenes are a bit more enjoyable.This is a much better addition to my Lord of the Rings library -- and DVDs will play in all DVD players (region respecting unless you find a region free version out there).The ""official"" reviews suggest the added content was very limited -- yet in my opinion it actually makes the movie play much better and more consistent story spell hold.As to the people complaining about the adaptation of the book, remember there will always be differences, among which are the lack of mental insights gained from reading about characters internal responses to the various situations... so far as I know only the original adaptation of DUNE attempted this and even then there was much chopping due to the time limits to a Hollywood production -- so a story such as The Hobbit will be different in a motion picture than the book -- yet this production (with the extended footage) holds true enough that Tolken's vision is not lost in the adaptation.It is a worthy addition to any video library -- and worth interviewing with reading of the books.I will now wait for the extended edition of the Hobbit 2 before watching it so I can just enjoy the better movie.-----------------Non-extended version review:Firstly, must point out that I rented this movie via amazon's Instant Video -- my only problem is actually a problem with Cox because if I am connected for more than an hour, they tent to temper my speed so that Amazon's streaming system gets lost or blocked.Now about the movie. I was disappointed -- I watched it in two parts on my 48 hour rent:Night 1 I watched to the Rivendale sequence was completed -- (note that there can be no spoiler in this movie as long as you have read the book)  There was a lot of attempt at humor that just did not do near as well as the Quad from the Lord of the Rings hobits did. It actually seemed to bog the movie down a rather large bit making it really hard to stick with it. I hope that the Extended Version that will come out towards Christmas will correct that.Night 2 -- Much better going from the Rivendale departure to the end -- more of what the Lord of the Rings movies was about. But that is not to say that there were'nt a few elements to take away from it -- the goblin king seemed at times to havt the kind of Gungan King appeal from the Star Wars Episode 1 and as much as I liked the original cuts of Star Wars 4 to 6, I did not like the Star Wars Episode I at all -- so something like that just takes away from Jackson's Hobit.I suspect that this is due to the essential take-over of MGM's corporation oversite by WB -- they tend to be more flashy with fantasy stuff (Remember how the mishandled Harry Potter?)I hope that the Jackson oversite when putting out the extended versions will prove the same with this movie as it did with the LotR -- believe it or not the Extended Cuts of LotR is so extra-ordinarily better than the theatrical release, so that I why I chose to rent this rather than buy -- and will look forward to the Extended cut release at the end of this year -- economy permitting.",5,The Hobit -- The Plain Edition and Amazon Rental,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,3801,"['Hobbit', 'Unexpected', 'Journey', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'DVD', '+UltraViolet', '2013', 'made', 'purchase', 'local', 'target', 'rather', 'Amazon.What', 'need', 'know', 'digital', 'Ultra-violet', 'very', 'limited', 'choice', 'options', 'MUST', 'have', 'one', 'digital', 'provider', 'proprietary', 'systems', 'such', 'Apple', 'iTunes', 'can', 'only', 'access', 'registered', 'approved', 'devices', 'are', 'limited', 'how', 'many', 'can', 'access', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'buy', 'second', 'license', 'it.It', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'just', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'do', 'digital', 'yourself.Now', 'Extended', 'Version', 'movie', 'what', 'raised', '3', 'stars', '5', 'Extended', 'Version', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'less', 'choppy', 'Even', 'humor', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'enjoyable.This', 'much', 'better', 'addition', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'library', 'DVDs', 'will', 'play', 'DVD', 'players', 'region', 'respecting', 'find', 'region', 'free', 'version', 'there', '.The', 'official', 'suggest', 'added', 'content', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'yet', 'opinion', 'actually', 'movie', 'play', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'consistent', 'story', 'spell', 'hold.As', 'people', 'complaining', 'adaptation', 'book', 'remember', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'differences', 'are', 'lack', 'mental', 'insights', 'gained', 'reading', 'characters', 'internal', 'responses', 'various', 'situations', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'original', 'adaptation', 'DUNE', 'attempted', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'much', 'chopping', 'due', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'story', 'such', 'Hobbit', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'motion', 'picture', 'book', 'yet', 'production', 'extended', 'footage', 'true', 'enough', 'Tolken', 'vision', 'not', 'lost', 'adaptation.It', 'worthy', 'addition', 'video', 'library', 'worth', 'interviewing', 'reading', 'books.I', 'will', 'now', 'wait', 'extended', 'edition', 'Hobbit', '2', 'watching', 'can', 'just', 'enjoy', 'better', 'movie.', '-Non-extended', 'version', 'review', 'Firstly', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'rented', 'movie', 'amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'only', 'problem', 'actually', 'problem', 'Cox', 'am', 'connected', 'more', 'hour', 'tent', 'temper', 'speed', 'so', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'system', 'lost', 'blocked.Now', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'watched', 'two', 'parts', '48', 'hour', 'rent', 'Night', '1', 'watched', 'Rivendale', 'sequence', 'was', 'completed', 'note', 'can', 'be', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'lot', 'attempt', 'humor', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Quad', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'hobits', 'did', 'actually', 'seemed', 'bog', 'movie', 'down', 'rather', 'large', 'bit', 'making', 'really', 'hard', 'stick', 'hope', 'Extended', 'Version', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'towards', 'Christmas', 'will', 'correct', 'that.Night', '2', 'Much', 'better', 'going', 'Rivendale', 'departure', 'end', 'more', 'what', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'was', 'about', 'not', 'say', 'there', 'few', 'elements', 'take', 'away', 'goblin', 'king', 'seemed', 'times', 'havt', 'kind', 'Gungan', 'King', 'appeal', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '1', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'original', 'cuts', 'Star', 'Wars', '4', '6', 'did', 'not', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'so', 'something', 'just', 'away', 'Jackson', 'Hobit.I', 'suspect', 'due', 'essential', 'take-over', 'MGM', 'corporation', 'oversite', 'WB', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'flashy', 'fantasy', 'stuff', 'Remember', 'how', 'mishandled', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'hope', 'Jackson', 'oversite', 'when', 'putting', 'out', 'extended', 'versions', 'will', 'prove', 'same', 'movie', 'did', 'LotR', 'believe', 'not', 'Extended', 'Cuts', 'LotR', 'so', 'extra-ordinarily', 'better', 'theatrical', 'release', 'why', 'chose', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'Extended', 'cut', 'release', 'end', 'year', 'economy', 'permitting']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

I also own a few other titles such as Avatar, The Avengers and The Life of Pi.  The Hobbit seems as if it was actually filmed with 3D in mind.  There are fun scenes where you have birds and other flying creatures appearing to fly right in your face.  Very cool.  There's a lot of that in The Life of Pi as well, which is also a great movie to watch in 3D.  Avatar, surprisingly, has been the weakest movie of those that I own as far as 3D goes.  While The Hobbit... as a movie is not necessarily the greatest, the 3D aspect of it made it a very entertaining and fun experience.

I am not a Tolkien purist; so I don't object to changing the book in a movie.  Unfortunately, Jackson seems to have either ignored or misunderstood eucatastrophe, the heart of Tolkien's epic vision and his greatest contribution to literature.Jackson's problem is that he can't resist portraying Bilbo Baggins as a hero.  A hero is a person or a character who courageously exercises his skills in the cause of good.  Jackson's Bilbo is far more active than Tolkien's.  Instead of suddenly rushing off to the join the dwarves' adventure, Tolkien's Bilbo has decided not to go until he is rushed out of his hobbit hole by Gandalf.  He doesn't help the dwarves in a fight against the trolls, but rather manages to escape while the trolls fight among themselves and with the exception of Thorin is unable even to warn the dwarves, who are neatly bagged without much of a fight.  He most certainly does not rush to Thorin's aid against the orcs and the wolves, but, like Gandalf and the rest of the dwarves, is helplessly and hopelessly up a tree--a tree that Tolkien's Bilbo can not even get into without the help of the dwarf Dori. In Tolkien even Gandalf does not save himself and the rest of the party by sending a message to the eagles.  The eagles see the fires and hear the howling wolves and decide to steal the goblins' prey from them.Some of these errors can be attributed to Jackson's mistaken attempts to make the story more exciting and giving into the irresistible urge to use special effects, but the problem is much deeper.  Jackson has the concealed Bilbo see Gollum drop the ring and then take it.  In the novel Bilbo has been accidentally dropped by Dori as they are fleeing from the goblins, then is crawling in the dark when he just happens to touch a ring--the ring--and puts it in his pocket.  He does not guess the riddle concerning time because Gollum makes a mistake but rather unwittingly asks for time and serendipitously saves his life.What makes Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy more than a ripping good story is his fictional presentation of eucatastrophe in which heroes fail and evil defeats itself (See ""Harry Potter Part II: The Good and the Not So Good"").  The happy accidents in The Hobbit prepare us for the epic vision of The Lord of the Rings.Unlike his version of the Ring trilogy, Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit has his heroes, like Bilbo, too active in bringing about victory.  Eucatastrophe is gone.  The movie is entertaining, but it will not make our hearts swell with an inexplicable joy as our imaginations soar to a hope that is real but beyond humanity's reach.",3,Hobbits as Heroes,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2713,"['Last', 'weekend', 'saw', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'entertained', 'disappointed', 'am', 'not', 'Tolkien', 'purist', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'changing', 'book', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'Jackson', 'have', 'either', 'ignored', 'misunderstood', 'eucatastrophe', 'heart', 'Tolkien', 'epic', 'vision', 'greatest', 'contribution', 'literature.Jackson', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'portraying', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'hero', 'hero', 'person', 'character', 'who', 'skills', 'cause', 'good', 'Jackson', 'Bilbo', 'far', 'more', 'active', 'Tolkien', 'Instead', 'suddenly', 'rushing', 'off', 'join', 'dwarves', 'adventure', 'Tolkien', 'Bilbo', 'decided', 'not', 'go', 'rushed', 'hobbit', 'hole', 'Gandalf', ""n't"", 'help', 'dwarves', 'fight', 'trolls', 'rather', 'escape', 'trolls', 'fight', 'exception', 'Thorin', 'unable', 'even', 'warn', 'dwarves', 'who', 'are', 'neatly', 'bagged', 'much', 'fight', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'rush', 'Thorin', 'aid', 'orcs', 'wolves', 'Gandalf', 'rest', 'dwarves', 'helplessly', 'hopelessly', 'tree', 'tree', 'Tolkien', 'Bilbo', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'help', 'dwarf', 'Dori', 'Tolkien', 'even', 'Gandalf', 'not', 'save', 'rest', 'party', 'sending', 'message', 'eagles', 'eagles', 'see', 'fires', 'hear', 'howling', 'wolves', 'decide', 'steal', 'goblins', 'prey', 'them.Some', 'errors', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'Jackson', 'mistaken', 'attempts', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'exciting', 'giving', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'problem', 'much', 'deeper', 'Jackson', 'concealed', 'Bilbo', 'see', 'Gollum', 'drop', 'ring', 'then', 'take', 'novel', 'Bilbo', 'been', 'accidentally', 'dropped', 'Dori', 'are', 'fleeing', 'goblins', 'then', 'crawling', 'dark', 'when', 'just', 'touch', 'ring', 'ring', 'pocket', 'not', 'guess', 'riddle', 'concerning', 'time', 'Gollum', 'mistake', 'rather', 'unwittingly', 'asks', 'time', 'serendipitously', 'life.What', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'more', 'ripping', 'good', 'story', 'fictional', 'presentation', 'eucatastrophe', 'heroes', 'fail', 'evil', 'defeats', 'See', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Part', 'II', 'Good', 'Not', 'So', 'Good', 'happy', 'accidents', 'Hobbit', 'prepare', 'epic', 'vision', 'Lord', 'Rings.Unlike', 'version', 'Ring', 'trilogy', 'Jackson', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Hobbit', 'heroes', 'Bilbo', 'too', 'active', 'bringing', 'victory', 'Eucatastrophe', 'gone', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'hearts', 'swell', 'inexplicable', 'joy', 'imaginations', 'soar', 'hope', 'real', 'humanity', 'reach']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

The whole goblin battle that makes up the final third of the movie has so many individual awe-inspiring moments within it that the entertainment value of the movie is justified by that alone.  I saw The Hobbit:AUJ in IMAX 3D, and found this to be the best use of the 3D format I've seen since Avatar, though not quite at the same high level.  Both interior and exterior scenes really come alive.  Story-wise, it's been awhile since I read the book, but this movie doesn't seem to follow what I remember all that well -- not that it mattered too much to me, as I maintained interest throughout.

1450025,AP3B615GM191G,B0059XTU1S,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[21, 31]","When Peter Jackson adapted the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy from J.R.R. Tolkien onto the big screen, it became one of the most epic film series of all-time, full of drama, action, adventure, and fantasy.  Now, ""The Hobbit"" is back on the big screen (once again from Jackson) and manages to fully recapture that old magic.For a basic plot summary, ""The Hobbit"" is the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is unexpectedly called upon by Gandalf the Wizard (Ian McKellen) to participate in a grand adventure to help a group of dwarves regain their long-lost treasure.  Along the way, the group encounters such creatures as trolls, orcs, goblins, and even a sad, slimy little creature who seems to have multiple personalities and is in possession of a very powerful item.Though many reviews of this movie were quite negative, calling it overblown, strange, or even outright boring, it had the complete opposite effect on me.  As a huge fan of LOTR, I felt as if I had been transported back into that fantasy universe once again, and I loved every minute of it.  Though the decision to break the one Tolkien book into three movies is controversial from a number of different viewpoints (from ticket sales to subject matter), I can now say that it will (at the very least) be fun to have two more theater experiences inside that LOTR realm.Perhaps the most interesting part of ""The Hobbit"" experience, however, is the fact that its role in the overall scheme of things (in comparison to the book) is actually just about as opposite as it could be.  ""The Hobbit"" book was written as a tale for his children, and thus had a very lighthearted tone.  When it was eventually published and achieved great success, Tolkien then decided to write the much more serious LOTR.  However, seeing as how the LOTR series was put on the big screen FIRST, it was a challenge to the filmmakers to get the tone right: Stay true to the tone of the book (sometimes goofy), and the LOTR geeks will cry foul.  Be too ""serious"", and the book enthusiasts will discount you.  Overall, I felt as if Jackson did a solid job of walking that fine line, as this one does have more fun moments than any of the LOTR pictures.Overall, I really have nothing bad to say about ""The Hobbit"".  I have enjoyed the story since I was a child, so to see it done right on the big screen is a treat beyond imagination.  To me, it was neither boring nor stale, but rather exciting and intense.  Though strange that the journey will not be complete for nearly two years, I will thoroughly enjoy the next two films if they are anything like the quality of this one.",5,"Easily Brings Back The Old ""LOTR"" Magic",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2617,"['When', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'adapted', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'big', 'screen', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'film', 'series', 'all-time', 'full', 'drama', 'action', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'Now', 'Hobbit', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'once', 'again', 'Jackson', 'fully', 'recapture', 'old', 'magic.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Hobbit', 'tale', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'called', 'upon', 'Gandalf', 'Wizard', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'participate', 'grand', 'adventure', 'help', 'group', 'dwarves', 'regain', 'long-lost', 'treasure', 'way', 'group', 'encounters', 'such', 'creatures', 'trolls', 'orcs', 'goblins', 'even', 'sad', 'slimy', 'little', 'creature', 'who', 'have', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'possession', 'very', 'powerful', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'negative', 'calling', 'overblown', 'strange', 'even', 'outright', 'boring', 'had', 'complete', 'opposite', 'effect', 'huge', 'fan', 'LOTR', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'transported', 'back', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'once', 'again', 'loved', 'minute', 'decision', 'break', 'one', 'Tolkien', 'book', 'three', 'movies', 'controversial', 'number', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'ticket', 'sales', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'now', 'say', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'fun', 'have', 'two', 'more', 'theater', 'experiences', 'LOTR', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'Hobbit', 'experience', 'however', 'fact', 'role', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things', 'comparison', 'book', 'actually', 'just', 'as', 'opposite', 'could', 'be', 'Hobbit', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'tale', 'children', 'thus', 'had', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'When', 'was', 'eventually', 'published', 'achieved', 'great', 'success', 'Tolkien', 'then', 'decided', 'write', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'LOTR', 'However', 'seeing', 'how', 'LOTR', 'series', 'was', 'put', 'big', 'screen', 'FIRST', 'was', 'challenge', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'tone', 'right', 'Stay', 'true', 'tone', 'book', 'sometimes', 'goofy', 'LOTR', 'geeks', 'will', 'cry', 'foul', 'Be', 'too', 'serious', 'book', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'discount', 'Overall', 'felt', 'Jackson', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'one', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'moments', 'LOTR', 'pictures.Overall', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'bad', 'say', 'Hobbit', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'was', 'child', 'so', 'see', 'done', 'right', 'big', 'screen', 'treat', 'imagination', 'was', 'neither', 'boring', 'stale', 'rather', 'exciting', 'intense', 'strange', 'journey', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'anything', 'quality', 'one']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
1450026,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B0059XTU1S,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[15, 23]","Excellent movie.  By far better than most fantasy or sci-fi flicks made in the last decade.  Unfortunately, it is a bit too oriented toward kids.  It does not follow the book faithfully, but that's ok.  The book had very little action.  This movie had a lot of action.  Unfortunately, no blood.  Even lopped off heads are clean and dry.  Which is incredibly stupid.  But the action is intense and enjoyable.  Very innovative and visually spectacular.Sometimes the film does not take itself seriously.  The dwarves are akin to Snow White's 7 from Disney too often.  I had been expecting Jackson to make a grittier, realistic, foreboding tale of Bilbo's discovery and the dwarves' heart-wrenching quest for their home.  But sometimes the dwarves are silly.Rhadagast the Brown was a turned into a silly twit with comedic timing and stupid expressions.  In the books he is a mysterious wizard like Gandalf!  Nobody knows much about him.  Give us some cool wizard whose magic is at one with the forest and the elements.  Not some dope out of a Disney cartoon!The opening scenes with old Bilbo and Frodo are superfluous--a bit boring.1) The action scenes are fun and innovative, but no blood.  And, yes, sometimes you cannot see what everyone is doing.  But these scenes are worth re-watching.Funny, because each of those dwarves should have been spotlighted in combat sequences choreographed for their characters.  The actors are more than up to the task.  The dwarves are each so different and interesting that Jackson truly could have characterized each dwarf through action.  But the movie failed to make any of the dwarves special, in my opinion.  Except maybe Thorin and Kili.2) The settings and character make-up and costumes are all excellent.  The movie is beautiful to behold.  The effects are often very realistic.  Only the Goblin King is a stupid kid's movie creature.  He even jokes as he is dying.  Very poor writing at that moment.3) The acting is superb.  No one does a bad job.  No one.  Even the extras are truly entertaining and in character, whether standing around or in action scenes.  This Bilbo is the true Bilbo.  Forget the one from LOTR.4) The soundtrack is excellent, moody, appropriate.  Even the stupid dwarf dish-cleaning song is actually in the book, so that is ok, I suppose.  Still hard to bear, when you are hoping for a serious movie.  It's cute.Anyway, there is much more to praise than hate about this film.  Overall it is a beautiful action film that Tolkien fans HAVE to own.  It has its mediocre parts, but these are well-done mediocrity far above most of the drivel Hollywood pukes out all year.So with love in my heart, I say give it a watch.  It is often brilliant.  If you are a fantasy lover, BUY IT.",4,"A Little Childish, But A Great Movie",1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2741,"['Excellent', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'Unfortunately', 'bit', 'too', 'oriented', 'kids', 'not', 'follow', 'book', 'faithfully', 'ok', 'book', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'Unfortunately', 'blood', 'Even', 'lopped', 'off', 'heads', 'are', 'clean', 'dry', 'Which', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'action', 'intense', 'enjoyable', 'Very', 'innovative', 'visually', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'dwarves', 'are', 'akin', 'Snow', 'White', '7', 'Disney', 'too', 'often', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'Jackson', 'make', 'grittier', 'realistic', 'foreboding', 'tale', 'Bilbo', 'discovery', 'dwarves', 'heart-wrenching', 'quest', 'home', 'dwarves', 'are', 'Brown', 'was', 'turned', 'silly', 'twit', 'comedic', 'timing', 'stupid', 'expressions', 'books', 'mysterious', 'wizard', 'Gandalf', 'Nobody', 'much', 'Give', 'cool', 'wizard', 'magic', 'one', 'forest', 'elements', 'Not', 'dope', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'opening', 'scenes', 'old', 'Bilbo', 'Frodo', 'are', 'superfluous', 'bit', 'boring.1', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'innovative', 'blood', 'yes', 'sometimes', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'doing', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 're-watching.Funny', 'dwarves', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spotlighted', 'combat', 'sequences', 'choreographed', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'dwarves', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'interesting', 'Jackson', 'truly', 'could', 'have', 'characterized', 'dwarf', 'action', 'movie', 'failed', 'make', 'dwarves', 'special', 'opinion', 'maybe', 'Thorin', 'Kili.2', 'settings', 'character', 'make-up', 'costumes', 'are', 'excellent', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'effects', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'realistic', 'Only', 'Goblin', 'King', 'stupid', 'kid', 'movie', 'creature', 'even', 'dying', 'Very', 'poor', 'writing', 'moment.3', 'acting', 'superb', 'one', 'bad', 'job', 'one', 'Even', 'extras', 'are', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'character', 'standing', 'around', 'action', 'scenes', 'Bilbo', 'true', 'Bilbo', 'Forget', 'one', 'LOTR.4', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'moody', 'appropriate', 'Even', 'stupid', 'dwarf', 'dish-cleaning', 'song', 'actually', 'book', 'ok', 'suppose', 'Still', 'hard', 'bear', 'when', 'are', 'hoping', 'serious', 'movie', 'cute.Anyway', 'much', 'more', 'praise', 'hate', 'film', 'Overall', 'beautiful', 'action', 'film', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'HAVE', 'own', 'mediocre', 'parts', 'are', 'well-done', 'mediocrity', 'far', 'most', 'drivel', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'year.So', 'love', 'heart', 'say', 'give', 'watch', 'often', 'brilliant', 'are', 'fantasy', 'lover', 'BUY', 'IT']",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
