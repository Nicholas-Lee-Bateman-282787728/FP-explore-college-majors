There are a lot of movement repetitions - it's not exactly classical vinyassa yoga, but it is a fresh and interesting alternative!I usually discard a lot of yoga discs because there are just not challenging enough. Not this one!At first I didn't like the music, but it grew on me. It is very Eastern. The only thing that bothers me on this disc is all the idols!Nice stage design. Pleasant and somewhat deep and interesting commentary. Janets got a nice voice and a mature attitude.Nice disc.",5,Nice challenging and interesting yoga disc,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,627,"[""n't"", 'look', 'disc', 'too', 'available', 'worth', 'getting', 'are', 'interemediate', 'yogi', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'are', 'lot', 'movement', 'repetitions', 'not', 'exactly', 'classical', 'vinyassa', 'yoga', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'alternative', 'usually', 'discard', 'lot', 'yoga', 'discs', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough', 'Not', 'one', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'music', 'grew', 'very', 'Eastern', 'only', 'thing', 'bothers', 'disc', 'idols', 'Nice', 'stage', 'design', 'Pleasant', 'somewhat', 'deep', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'Janets', 'got', 'nice', 'voice', 'mature', 'attitude.Nice', 'disc']",Radiant Flow with Janet Stone

1202827,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B001I4BR9A,James E. White,"[4, 4]","Janet Stone's Radiant Flow is geared towards yogis/yoginis with some experience under there belts or at least very gifted beginner (e.g. flexible person coming from dance background).  The poses flow quickly and challenging.  For instance, Janet has a series that leads into a side crow pose (balancing your body on both arms one leg to the side the other straight back).  This in and of itself is not easy, but the sequence leading up to the pose is what really sets this apart from many yoga DVDs I've owned.  I have read some criticism of her DVDs that they are too expensive for what you get.  That you should get 2-3 sessions for the money.  Honestly, this one flow is better than anything else I've done to date and that includes accomplished Yoga instructors like Shiva Rea and Debbie Dobbins (both of whom make awesome Yoga DVDs, and I consider them the gold standard in this area.  So if you are an experienced practitioner looking for the next level in your yoga practice, this is a must buy.",5,The toughest Vinyasa Yoga I've done...loved it,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,1002,"['Janet', 'Stone', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'geared', 'towards', 'yogis/yoginis', 'experience', 'belts', 'least', 'very', 'gifted', 'beginner', 'e.g', 'flexible', 'person', 'coming', 'dance', 'background', 'poses', 'flow', 'quickly', 'challenging', 'instance', 'Janet', 'series', 'side', 'crow', 'pose', 'balancing', 'body', 'arms', 'one', 'leg', 'side', 'other', 'straight', 'back', 'not', 'easy', 'sequence', 'leading', 'up', 'pose', 'what', 'really', 'apart', 'many', 'yoga', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'have', 'read', 'criticism', 'DVDs', 'are', 'too', 'expensive', 'what', 'get', 'should', 'get', '2-3', 'sessions', 'money', 'Honestly', 'one', 'flow', 'better', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'done', 'date', 'accomplished', 'Yoga', 'instructors', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Debbie', 'Dobbins', 'whom', 'make', 'awesome', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'consider', 'gold', 'standard', 'area', 'So', 'are', 'experienced', 'practitioner', 'looking', 'next', 'level', 'yoga', 'practice', 'must', 'buy']",Radiant Flow with Janet Stone

I've been wanting both these DVDs (Radiant Flow and Mellow Flow) for a long time after trying her CD, so when my mother sent me some money for my birthday, I treated myself to both.The flows were creative and interesting, balanced, heart opening, challenging, always in movement, in breath, in love. I am sitting here feeling like a flower that was just watered deeply and is now being embraced by the sun and the sweet air. I didn't want it to end. I wish I lived closer to San Francisco. I'd go to Janet's Saturday morning class every week that I could.I'll let other reviewers be quantitative in their reviews. All I can really say is that I felt my own beautiful strength in everything I did in such a joyful and gentle way. I am convinced that if everyone did Janet Stone yoga, there would be Peace on Earth.(Just a caution: This is not a beginner's practice, but definitely one to aspire to.)",5,Janet Stone's Radiance Ripples into my Being and out into my World,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,942,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'done', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'DVDs', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'Mellow', 'Flow', 'long', 'time', 'trying', 'CD', 'so', 'when', 'mother', 'sent', 'money', 'birthday', 'treated', 'both.The', 'flows', 'were', 'creative', 'interesting', 'balanced', 'heart', 'opening', 'challenging', 'always', 'movement', 'breath', 'love', 'am', 'sitting', 'here', 'feeling', 'flower', 'was', 'just', 'watered', 'deeply', 'now', 'being', 'embraced', 'sun', 'sweet', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'wish', 'lived', 'closer', 'San', 'Francisco', ""'d"", 'go', 'Janet', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'class', 'week', 'could.I', ""'ll"", 'let', 'other', 'reviewers', 'be', 'quantitative', 'reviews', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'felt', 'own', 'beautiful', 'strength', 'everything', 'did', 'joyful', 'gentle', 'way', 'am', 'convinced', 'everyone', 'did', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'yoga', 'would', 'be', 'Peace', 'Earth', 'Just', 'caution', 'not', 'beginner', 'practice', 'definitely', 'one', 'aspire']",Radiant Flow with Janet Stone
1202829,A10OLGF4DCMGOR,B001I4BR9A,yogini71,"[1, 1]","If I could only have one it would be Janet Stone, and if I could only have one yoga DVD it would probably by this one.  However some days I have trouble deciding which is my favorite yoga DVD: Ananda Vinyasa or Radiant Flow.  Radiant Flow is better for me on the days when I want something really energizing, and I love Ananda when I am in the mood to be very introspective.The Instructor:  Janet's narration is excellent.  The practice is very creative, but her guidance makes it very easy to follow.  She is one of the very few instructors who I feel like I can ""trust"" to take care of me the whole way through.  In addition to excellent cuing, her commentary is very inspiring.  She reminds you continuously to appreciate your body and what it does for you.The Practice:  As I mentioned above, the sequence is excellent.  This is definitely Janet's most challenging DVD, but not in the way that wears you out.  It seems like a lot of yoga DVDs try to make it a workout and forget the deeper goals of yoga.  Not here.  Everything flows beautifully as if she can anticipate exactly what my body is going to need at each moment in the practice.  At the end I never feel like I wish I had gotten more attention in one area or another, or that there was a pose I wanted to do that we didn't do, or one I wished to have held longer.  To me this more than anything else is a testament to how great this DVD is.The Music:  Absolutely perfect.  It adjusts throughout the practice so it complements what you are doing very well.The Production and Scenery:  Gorgeous!Before buying Radiant Flow I was a bit unsure because the DVDs are relatively expensive.  But there is a reason you can't find anything from Janet Stone used.  This practice is worth every penny and more; I'm even debating buying an extra copy in case I ""need"" this practice some day and for whatever reason my current DVD won't play.  I've been practicing yoga for 7 years and have worked with a lot of instructors and DVDs.  Janet is the best I have come across:  better in my opinion than Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, Seane Corn, Rodney Yee, and the list goes on.  Her practice has clear Shiva Rea influences, but I really like the way her DVDs are put together more than Shiva's.",5,Can't give this one enough praise,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2252,"['could', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'would', 'probably', 'one', 'However', 'days', 'have', 'trouble', 'deciding', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'Ananda', 'Vinyasa', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'better', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'something', 'really', 'energizing', 'love', 'Ananda', 'when', 'am', 'mood', 'be', 'very', 'introspective.The', 'Instructor', 'Janet', 'narration', 'excellent', 'practice', 'very', 'creative', 'guidance', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'instructors', 'who', 'feel', 'can', 'trust', 'take', 'care', 'whole', 'way', 'addition', 'excellent', 'cuing', 'commentary', 'very', 'inspiring', 'continuously', 'appreciate', 'body', 'what', 'you.The', 'Practice', 'mentioned', 'sequence', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'Janet', 'most', 'challenging', 'DVD', 'not', 'way', 'out', 'lot', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'try', 'make', 'workout', 'forget', 'deeper', 'goals', 'yoga', 'Not', 'here', 'Everything', 'beautifully', 'can', 'anticipate', 'exactly', 'what', 'body', 'going', 'need', 'moment', 'practice', 'end', 'never', 'feel', 'wish', 'had', 'gotten', 'more', 'attention', 'one', 'area', 'was', 'pose', 'wanted', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'wished', 'have', 'held', 'longer', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'testament', 'how', 'great', 'DVD', 'is.The', 'Music', 'Absolutely', 'perfect', 'practice', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'very', 'well.The', 'Production', 'Scenery', 'Gorgeous', 'buying', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'was', 'bit', 'unsure', 'DVDs', 'are', 'relatively', 'expensive', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'used', 'practice', 'worth', 'penny', 'more', ""'m"", 'even', 'debating', 'buying', 'extra', 'copy', 'case', 'need', 'practice', 'day', 'reason', 'current', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', ""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', '7', 'years', 'have', 'worked', 'lot', 'instructors', 'DVDs', 'Janet', 'best', 'have', 'come', 'better', 'opinion', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'list', 'practice', 'clear', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'influences', 'really', 'way', 'DVDs', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'more', 'Shiva']",Radiant Flow with Janet Stone
1202830,A2L6EV0V3SOATU,B001I4BR9A,Yoni,"[10, 10]","I bought the 2 Janet Stone DVD's from her website , I am a Shiva Rea fan and I heard she was one of Janet's inspirations. If you own Shiva Rea's Fluid Power and Creative Core Abs you will notice a lot of the moves and variations of poses. I liked this practice better than Mellow Flow which I didn't find so mellow. Radiant Flow is challenging and fast paced though I wish it was slower so I can concentrate in the poses better but it is still a fun and sweaty flowing practice. Here is a description of the practice but I probably forgot some poses and it isn't necessarily in order - It starts sitting and chanting om once , then it moves to some poses in kneeling position like kneeling bow and kneeling side bow stretch. there were some up dog / down dog fluid vinysas , deep lunge with a tricep stretch , lunge with twist , chair with twist with no hold , just moving in and out of the pose 3 times each side. warrior 1 with eagle arms to warrior 3 with eagle arms  (tough) bound warrior 2 to triangle ,yogic squat to wide legged standing forward bend with several variations and tripod headstand , a full split , a strange lunge position that goes straight into side crow with legs straight (which you can see on youtube) , crow and the scorpion plank / down dog to side plank/bridge from Shiva's Dancing Warrior 1008 is repeated a few times throughout the practice. I have to say that I felt a burn in my legs after the standing sequence.It also has a core sequence (similar to Shiva's) with backbends - dolphin to forearm plank with pulses and then sphinx to plank with pulses (tough), leaning back while kneeling and then camel pose. several core exercises on the back and bridge with several varaitions (with one leg for instance) plow to seated forward bend , supine poses and then plow again with shoulderstand ,then shavasana. I wish there were more backbends since it's a good preparation practice for backbends. the music is good (shaman's dream).",5,Challenging & fast paced creative vinyasa yoga,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,1962,"['bought', '2', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'DVD', 'website', 'am', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'fan', 'heard', 'was', 'one', 'Janet', 'inspirations', 'own', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Fluid', 'Power', 'Creative', 'Core', 'Abs', 'will', 'notice', 'lot', 'moves', 'variations', 'poses', 'liked', 'practice', 'better', 'Mellow', 'Flow', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'mellow', 'Radiant', 'Flow', 'challenging', 'fast', 'paced', 'wish', 'was', 'slower', 'can', 'concentrate', 'poses', 'better', 'still', 'fun', 'sweaty', 'flowing', 'practice', 'Here', 'description', 'practice', 'probably', 'forgot', 'poses', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'order', 'sitting', 'chanting', 'om', 'once', 'then', 'poses', 'kneeling', 'position', 'kneeling', 'bow', 'kneeling', 'side', 'bow', 'stretch', 'were', 'up', 'dog', '/', 'down', 'dog', 'fluid', 'vinysas', 'deep', 'lunge', 'tricep', 'stretch', 'lunge', 'twist', 'chair', 'twist', 'hold', 'just', 'moving', 'pose', '3', 'times', 'side', 'warrior', '1', 'eagle', 'arms', 'warrior', '3', 'eagle', 'arms', 'tough', '2', 'triangle', 'yogic', 'squat', 'wide', 'legged', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'several', 'variations', 'tripod', 'headstand', 'full', 'split', 'strange', 'lunge', 'position', 'straight', 'side', 'crow', 'legs', 'straight', 'can', 'see', 'youtube', 'crow', 'scorpion', 'plank', '/', 'down', 'dog', 'side', 'plank/bridge', 'Shiva', 'Dancing', 'Warrior', '1008', 'repeated', 'few', 'times', 'practice', 'have', 'say', 'felt', 'burn', 'legs', 'standing', 'sequence.It', 'also', 'core', 'sequence', 'similar', 'Shiva', 'backbends', 'dolphin', 'forearm', 'plank', 'pulses', 'then', 'sphinx', 'plank', 'pulses', 'tough', 'leaning', 'back', 'kneeling', 'then', 'camel', 'pose', 'several', 'core', 'exercises', 'back', 'bridge', 'several', 'varaitions', 'one', 'leg', 'instance', 'plow', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'supine', 'poses', 'then', 'plow', 'again', 'shoulderstand', 'then', 'shavasana', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'backbends', 'good', 'preparation', 'practice', 'backbends', 'music', 'good', 'shaman', 'dream']",Radiant Flow with Janet Stone
