Sketches to gross you out and offend you at the same time. Sketches to make you laugh and some to make you think.  They even carry some characters over from the first season.

The comedy is usually centered around a ""straight man"" becoming increasingly infuriated or insane as he/she is worked on by the UCB's ""cyborgs."" (characters that the UCB agents us to spread chaos) The comedy style of the troupe is very unique. They mention pop-culture but they aren't completely centered on it. They sometimes use accents and wacky costumes, but they definitely don't rely on them to be funny. Fans of absurdist comedy will love these guys! I recommend that you buy Season One first, however, as the UCB is fond of bringing up references from previous sketches.",5,For Those Who Have Not Watched UCB before,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,643,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Upright', 'Citizens', 'Brigade', 'yet', 'should', 'comedy', 'usually', 'centered', 'straight', 'man', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'infuriated', 'insane', 'he/she', 'worked', 'UCB', 'cyborgs', 'characters', 'UCB', 'agents', 'spread', 'chaos', 'comedy', 'style', 'troupe', 'very', 'unique', 'mention', 'pop-culture', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'centered', 'sometimes', 'use', 'accents', 'wacky', 'costumes', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'be', 'funny', 'Fans', 'absurdist', 'comedy', 'will', 'love', 'guys', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Season', 'One', 'first', 'however', 'UCB', 'fond', 'bringing', 'up', 'references', 'previous', 'sketches']",Upright Citizens Brigade: Season 2

From the ""Drawn Together"" commercials you can't skip through (hasn't Dave Chapelle already sold enough DVDs for you guys?) to the grainy, interlaced video (no, I'm not talking about the hidden camera footage interspersed with the sketches), it seems like this was a project they just couldn't get done quickly or cheaply enough. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised considering the way they've treated the show from day one, but I was hoping they'd finally seen the value of the work they continually let slip away and die in favor of Carlos Mencia and Blue Collar TV.
