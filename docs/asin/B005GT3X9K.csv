1460584,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005GT3X9K,DVD Verdict,"[2, 3]","Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --The cast is terrific, with Wysocki making a terrific impression in his first major role. I hope he doesn't become one of those actors who everyone admires but who is still shipped off to TV guest star obscurity due to his unconventional appearance. He never permits himself to slip into melodrama, nor does he oversell his material at any point. This is the kind of terrific performance which is likely to be ignored during awards season simply because you never catch Wysocki acting. Reilly is also quite strong as Fitzgerald, delivering a performance which circles similar territory to the characters he essayed so well in Cyrus and Magnolia: an earnest, good-hearted man who's trying so hard not to screw up the positive relationships he's formed. Fans of The Office will also find Bratton's work a revelation; he's affecting in the role and has considerable screen presence.Terri arrives on Blu-ray sporting a very attractive 1080p/1.85:1 transfer. Cinematography doesn't tend to be a strong point of character-driven indie flicks in general, but this one looks terrific and benefits from quite a bit of graceful visual storytelling. There were times when I was reminded of Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, another small film which found many striking images in drab surroundings. Detail is superb throughout and blacks are deep and inky. Audio is also solid, with clean dialogue, a few moments of impressively detailed sound design and a resonant musical score (which oh-so-occasionally threatens to become too precious, but generally manages to deliver the right amount of emotional punch without becoming cloying).

1460585,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005GT3X9K,G. Teslovich,"[0, 0]","Positives:Good acting; engaging storyline; good cinematography. More realistic portrayals than in the teacher/issues movie ""An Invisible Sign"".Caveats:The storyline is more believable if the intra-school banter and interactions with students, teachers and administration took place in an alternative school or in a small town, small school setting. What was shown in the film would not be likely in a larger populated school. Some alternative schools and their teachers or even some  small schools, where it's easier to bypass administrative/legal hurdles, would have interceded more overtly from buying him clothes to contacting social service agencies for help at home. Most schools would have a student group to assist students like Terri by addressing both the student population as a whole and Terri personally on dealing with his differences.Negatives:The drinking and sex scenes were over played in the movie relative to all that takes place in a high school student's life and certainly relative to how Terri developed into due to his unique physical characteristics, isolation and home hospice challenges.What is it with music as filler or to set tone in Indie style movies - it's becoming too much of a crutch for not attending to good stories, writing, research and acting.

One hundred or so minutes later, I was pleasantly surprised by an intimate movie that reminds us that the small things are what makes life worth living.  Centered around the travails of friendless, overweight teen Terri as he navigates high school, the world of the movie is lovingly crafted with interesting characters, all broken in their own ways.  In tiny bursts of joy, these characters escape the pain and frustration of their lives and find enough momentum to keep moving forward.  Jacob Wysocki gives a perfectly naturalistic performance as Terri, John C. Reilly is a combination of genuine and hilarious as an assistant principal, and Creed Bratton's portrayal of Terri's turning-toward-dementia uncle is surprisingly impressive.  When he experiences a brief moment of clarity, it turns into the movie's best scene.

1460587,ANVOS4JLN2MKR,B005GT3X9K,Lloyd Christmas,"[2, 9]","The acting was impeccable throughout the movie, and every scene with John C. Reilly in it was worthwhile, as he remains one of the most genuinely funny and endearingly believable actors out there.But the public schools scenes were unbelievable: Take it from someone who knows: In a public school setting nowadays, NO vice principal has the autonomy of time necessary to schedule regular time blocks to counsel students. This is just not what administrators in public school are able to do, even if they were as capable of it as Reilly's loveable character. Forget about it, it ain't happening in the real world--they don't even give the actual COUNSELORS that kind of time, are you kidding me? Any administrator in a government school in America today who has those kind of talents would get chewed up and spat out by the system and would never ever have made it to the ripe old age of Reilly's character. Again, I work in the school system, so I know what I'm talking about.Also, there were too many scenes at school where Reilly would be out-and-about on campus and there wouldn't be any students around and so he had a lot of time to talk to the protagonist one-on-one. This too was wincingly unrealistic to anyone who works in the public school system.But the worst problem with this movie was the disturbing scene where the teen characters mixed drugs and alcohol and almost had sex. This scene gave me the creeps as I kept waiting for something to go wrong and the whole movie to turn incongruously macabre. Do I know that more and more American teens engage in this behavior these days? Sure, you bet I do. I see the symptoms, and oftentimes the ravages of it everyday. But I don't need to SEE it, especially not in a movie scene which renders no judgment on it, and thereby could easily lead immature teenage viewers to believe that mixing drugs and alcohol, not to mention teen sex, is something that people can get away with without very soon suffering serious or even dire consequences. And this scene also destroyed the legitimacy of the female character: Initially, it cast the female character as a victim of sexual abuse at school, and therefore the protagonist fat kid was her rescuer. However, the disturbing alcohol-drugs-and-almost-sex scene showed that the girl had, in fact, a wanton alacrity when it came to sex and substance abuse, which undermined her character and made her ""rescue"" irrelevant and meaningless, pretty much like the rest of the movie. If the movie makers were chasing irrelevance, then they succeeded. But again, I don't need to see it.

Normally Terri for males is spelled with a ""Y"" as opposed to the cutesy ""I"" for females. This is symbolic of his role as a ""victim of circumstance"" in this awkward coming of age story. Terri is 15, obese and pathetic. He cares for his uncle who has memory lapses and bad days. Terri goes to school wearing pajamas and has a nemesis (Justin Prentice as Dirty Zach) who picks on him as well as is semi-intimate with a blond girl (Olivia Crocicchia as Heather) in which Terri is interested.John C. Reilly plays the semi-cool, slightly creepy, misfit school principal Mr. Fitzgerald who takes an interest in Terri's life as he is frequently late for homeroom. Terri quickly realizes that the principal only meets with misfits and is upset he is in that group. We see Terri and Heather's relationship bloom during a very bad music montage. The movie lumbers along slow and steady like Terri. At times I found myself waiting for something to happen that wasn't as boring as real life. Like most Indy movies it relishes in its uncomfortable scenes, substituting real human drama, which we get enough in our own life, for exploding heads on the screen. I admit it, I am shallow and enjoy exploding heads.If you are a big fan of Indie films and John C. Reilly this is a 5 star must see movie. The characters were unique and realistic. The dialogue flowed but was not abundantly witty or clever. There is a scene where graffiti states ""Fitzgerald is a zombie."" John C.

Terri (Wysocki) is a larger then average 15 year old. Feeling like an out cast and having to take care of his sick uncle he seems to give up. After repeated tardiness to school and his new wardrobe of pajamas only, the school's principal (Reilly) decides to take Terri under his wing. This is a new take on the outcast school kid movie. The actor playing Terri does a fantastic job with this and even Reilly is subdued and adds a lot to the character. While the movie is not anything original you really feel for this character and want things to go his way. Unlike most other outcast movies like ""She's The One"" or even ""Naploean Dynamite"" this one seems much more realistic and that makes it better then most of the movies in this type of genre. The humor in this is more subdued but still a pretty funny watch. Overall, not a bad movie with the type of humor that not everyone will get. Worth checking out though. I say B.Would I watch again? - No I don't think so.*Also try - Cyrus & Youth In Revolt",3,Another outcast school kid movie that is actually very good.More realistic then many of this type of movie.Worth seeing.

1460595,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005GT3X9K,Turfseer,"[0, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Another quirky indie comes down the pike by the name of 'Terri'. It's about an obese kid who goes to school in his pajamas and tries to cope in a world of peers who are against him. 'Terri' basically fits my definition of the classic quirky indie which puts forth a ""quirky protagonist who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo."" Here the ""reactionary"" group consists of the bullies who mock Terri and other ostracized kids at the school as well as unsympathetic teachers, who all seem to feel that any acts of kindness toward their students would be detrimental to their overall growth.Other quirky indies such as 'The Descendants', have a protagonist that begins as a member of a reactionary group, but then rebels against them (think of George Clooney's character taking a stand against those members of his family who side with the developers). With Terri, there's a variation on the common theme: he must shed his repressed upbringing but is never part of the reactionary group he's opposed to. In fact, Terri is an outcast from that group, from day one! In contrast to the punks at school, Terri actually has a good heart. This is manifested in his loving concern for his Uncle James, who is afflicted with early onset Alzheimer's. Terri's issues revolve around lack of self-esteem, exacerbated by the bullying at school as well as a wellspring of anger that sometimes emerges at inopportune times. Early on, after trapping mice in the attic, Terri begins trapping mice in the woods which upsets Uncle James, as he feels Terri might be getting enjoyment from the act of killing instead of merely taking care of a rodent problem.Enter John C. Reilly as Assistant Principal Mr. Fitzgerald, who appears to be in charge of all the school misfits. Fitzgerald is also an oddball himself, and pretends to yell at his charges behind closed doors, only to reassure them that's it's only an act. Fitzgerald tells the kids that the 'tough guy act' is primarily for the benefit of his secretary, Mrs. Hamish, who he views as needing some kind of invigoration as she is gravely ill and about to kick the proverbial bucket.A good part of the film revolves around Terri bonding with the kindly Mr. Fitzgerald. At first Terri feels betrayed by Fitzgerald after he claims to be giving Terri an exclusive peek at a childhood yearbook . But when Chad Markson (Terri's new potential friend and fellow outcast) informs Terri that Fitzgerald also let him take a look at the 'exclusive' yearbook, Terri turns on him, in a fit of jealousy. Later, Terri apologizes to Chad for 'losing it' and eventually grows closer to Fitzgerald, who by film's end, has morphed into the teenager's good 'buddy'.The plot thickens when Terri sticks up for the cute Heather Mills, who is also the victim of classroom bullies. Soon afterward Terri, Heather and Chad are popping pills (Uncle James' Alzheimer medication), down in the basement of Terri's home and strange things ensue. For one, Chad accepts a dare to urinate on his own pants. Later, Heather strips to her underclothes, and offers to have some kind of sexual contact with Terri. The shy Terri knows his limits and declines, but clearly Heather's offer has done wonders for his self-esteem.Nothing much happens after that! Fitzgerald takes Terri and Chad to Mrs. Hamish's funeral and later Fitzgerald reveals to Terri that he's been having some problems with his wife at home. The conflict with the bullies at school has been dropped and Fitzgerald never goes mano a mano with any of his disinterested colleagues.I'm sure 'Terri' has a good many boosters who are attracted to the offbeat characters and situations. But my problem with this kind of 'quirky' dramedy, is that there's something inherently distasteful in films of this ilk. Somehow the quirky outcasts (despite a few shortcomings) always manage to be of high noble stock, and the antagonists who they're pitted against, invariably are rotten to the core. It's a formula that's repeated over and over again and I find myself not wanting to root for the Terri's of this world, precisely because their underdog status is so undeserved (just about anyone would look good, if they were pitted against such nasty opponents).I enjoy watching John C. Reilly since he's in so many films and I always wonder what kind of character he's going to take on next. Here he's a sweet guy who's helping kids who need some positive reinforcement. Jacob Wysocki ably conveys the loner Terri but the character is too distasteful at times to be considered even near heroic. The same goes for Bridger Zadina as the equally weird Chad, who's urination routine at film's end, is also thoroughly off-putting. I kept wondering why Olivia Crocicchia as Heather ends up on the misfit list, considering that she's the cutest girl in the school. Finally, there's Creed Bratton as Uncle James. Catch the DVD extras and you'll be amazed that Bratton is a sensational blues singer and guitarist. Of course he should be, as he's the former member of the Grass Roots, the eminent pop rock band from the 60s.",2,"Quirky teenage outcast and allies triumph over stereotyped school bullies and
