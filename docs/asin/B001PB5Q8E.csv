Experience communism first hand, yet his faith and love keep him going. He is one of a remarkable man that I ever met in my life. He is a man who live the injustice in his life. But he said LOVE is contagious, with love you can change your enemy to become your friends. Then he become the president of the Pontifical office for Justice and Peace.

The movie was done more like a documentary, I could really feel what the Cardinal went thru. It was made in a way kids would get closer to, something they would be interested in or attracted to. Even my parish priest liked it so much he hasn't given it back to me yet! It's about a person that really existed,a now a day hero, not hundred's of years ago, but recently, with historical accuracy. Makes the life of St.Max Kolbe, Bl.John Paul II and St.Maria Goretti closer and better heroes for teenagers' to look up to.",5,An amazing story of hope and perseverance.,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,588,"['amazing', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Cardinal', 'Nguyen', 'was', 'just', 'incredible', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'documentary', 'could', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'Cardinal', 'went', 'thru', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'kids', 'would', 'get', 'closer', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'attracted', 'Even', 'parish', 'priest', 'liked', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'given', 'back', 'yet', 'person', 'really', 'existed', 'now', 'day', 'hero', 'not', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'recently', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'life', 'St.Max', 'Kolbe', 'Bl.John', 'Paul', 'II', 'St.Maria', 'Goretti', 'closer', 'better', 'heroes', 'teenagers', 'look', 'up']",Road of Hope: The Spiritual Journey of Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan
