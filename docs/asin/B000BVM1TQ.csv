950808,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000BVM1TQ,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 5]","As mentioned in the previous review, Red Dwarf abruptly went off the air following transmission of its sixth season at the end of 1993. A criminal case involving actor Craig Charles and the breakdown of the working relationship between writer-producers Rob Grant and Doug Naylor proved disastrous, and although both problems were eventually overcome (Charles was fully exonerated; Rob Grant departed to become a novelist leaving Naylor in charge) it took a long time to sort it all out.Other problems also seemed to conspire against Red Dwarf's return. As of the sixth season, Red Dwarf was pretty much the sole reason for the continued existence of the BBC's special effects and miniatures department, and with the show on indefinite hiatus the department was closed down, meaning that future special effects requirements would have to be handled by private firms and thus on a far more expensive basis. Actor Chris Barrie had also gone on to enjoy even greater success as the title character in BBC-1 sitcom The Brittas Empire, which was a much simpler and faster show to shoot than Dwarf. As a result, he decided not to appear in Red Dwarf on a full-time basis in the next series. Possibly even a bigger change was the removal of the studio audience, with the show now being fully pre-recorded and only the tape being shown to a studio audience later on. This clearly throws off the rhythms of the actors in the show, with some lines obscured by audience laughter and a few out-of-place pauses for laughs that weren't as big as was hoped for.Despite these problems, the show's ultimate return was not in doubt. It was BBC-2's single highest-rated TV programme, it was one of the biggest-selling BBC series on video (of any kind) in the 1990s and during the years it was off the air the BBC received numerous enquiries as to when the show would return.Season VII aired on BBC-2 in early 1997 and it was immediately clear that this was a different show to what had come before. Chris Barrie's character of Rimmer departed in the second episode, though he appeared in several further episodes in brief flashbacks or cameos. Despite a higher budget, the show also struggled with its special effects requirements, with very primitive CGI and some seriously shoddy model work replacing the very accomplished miniature filming and digital effects of Seasons 5-6.To help secure funding for the long-planned Red Dwarf movie (the prospective backers for which had asked for a major female character to be added to the roster), Naylor decided to add the character of Kristine Kochanksi to the crew on a full-time basis. Kochanski had appeared in several previous episodes in Seasons 1, 2 and 6 played by Clare Grogan, but with Grogan unavailable the role was recast with Chloe Annett. This move wasn't initially popular with the fans, as Annett's previous role had been in the quite spectacularly awful Crime Traveller, but Annett actually turned in a good performance and eventually won over many of the fanbase.With all of these behind-the-scenes changes it is perhaps inevitable that the quality of the scripts suffered quite badly. Season VII isn't quite the unwatchable pile of cack some hardcore fans describe it as, but it clearly hasn't had the same care and attention paid to the writing as in previous seasons. The extremely rapid dismissal of the Season VI cliffhanger is a little disappointing, but the completely nonsensical technobabble reasons given to explain why Starbug is now many times its former size are very strange indeed. That said, the rest of the opener, Tikka to Ride, in which the Red Dwarf crew inadvertently change history when they travel to Dallas in November 1963, actually has quite a clever premise and a strangely affecting conclusion. It also just about manages to fall on the right side of good taste.The second episode, Stoke Me a Clipper, is a bit of a disaster. A James Bond-style opening sequence featuring Ace Rimmer sky-surfing on the back of a crocodile is quite entertaining, but the rest of the episode is weak, illogical, badly contrived and deeply unfunny. The third episode, Ouroboros, re-introduces Kochanksi (or rather, a version of Kochanski from an alternate reality) and sees Lister's ex-wife (from Emohawk) showing up again. It's a little bit funnier, but still not up to the standards we expect from the show. Duct Soup, a 'bottle' show set in Starbug's flooded engineering decks, is probably the highlight of the season with some good dialogue and a few good laughs reminiscent of earlier seasons. Blue, in which Lister realises that he misses Rimmer, is also quite amusing as Kryten sets out to remind him precisely what Rimmer was like.Beyond a Joke starts with a great sequence in which Kryten, annoyed with the crew for missing supper due to being in a VR 'Jane Austen World' simulation, invades the simulation in a Russian T-73 tank and kills everyone (resulting in the largest explosion ever filmed for the series, due to over-eager army demolitions experts who were fans of the show trying to impress the actors). After this it nosedives into the ground with a lot of guff about 'nega-drives', more rogue simulants, more GELFs and a second 4000 series mechanoid who isn't very funny. Epideme has a good premise - a sentient virus that chats to its host whilst it tries to kill him - but the virus has a very annoying voice and the script doesn't really go anywhere after establishing the initial idea.Nanarchy, the Season VII finale, finally has the crew locating Red Dwarf and learning what happened to the ship when it disappeared. It's a mixed bag of an explanation, being amusing and SF-oriented, dealing with the hitherto unexplored-on-the-show science of nanotechnology, but it's also reliant on the idea that Kryten, a robot whom we have been reminded many times as having being built for the express purpose of cleaning lavatories and was extremely cheap, also had inside him billions of nanobots capable of rearranging atoms. It doesn't really make any sense. Anyway, there's another cliffhanger ending, the return of Holly (the original, played by Norman Lovett) and overall it's a decent enough ending to the season.The seventh season is a mixed bag, it has to be said. The visual effects and writing are radically inferior to what has come before, although the acting (from both the regulars and guest stars such as Brian Cox) remains strong. The addition of Kochanski to the cast also works surprisingly well, somewhat better than I think most people were expecting at the time. At the same time, this season was also made with significant background problems, and in that context it could have turned out worse. The biggest problem, and one that was unavoidable, is that the series really hurts without Rimmer as part of the mix. Luckily, Chris Barrier had such a blast filming this season that he agreed to return full-time for the eighth, which contributed to that season's somewhat higher quality.",3,A troubled

I think the new format allows the actors room to breathe and grow. Especially Duct Soup which is the closest to drama the series will get. The show is hilarious all the way through, and looking beyond the infamous cliffhanger of Nanarchy (which brought the return of Holly!) there's not an episode that is less than brilliant.Now, as for the DVD. For some reason they've decided to change things up a bit. The format of Disc 1-Show Disc 2-Features was apparently too restricting, so now they've split up the shows and made a 3-disc set. Disc 1 has Ep 1-3, along with the extended versions therein, and Disc 2 Ep 4-8. Why not 1-4, 5-8 I'll never know. I could care less about the extended episodes frankly. They special features, while interesting, are surprisingly sparse compared to the last few DVDs. Also, the episode by episode behind the scenes amounted to nothing but defending the series.All in all it's fantastic though.

I know a lot of people have written bad reviews about series seven(and eight) but I believe those people are the types that do not like change.Yes Chris kockanski is played by a new lady (Chloe Annett)and Chris Barrie leaves after the 2nd episode. Well not really leaves he is in an episode later on called Blue. Yes Kryten does get ""menstrating-woman"" syndrome. Yes Doug Naylor (writer) is not involved as much in the creative side of the show. However, laughs are still there! I will say that the first four seasons were more of a comedy based on sci-fi. While the later series are a Sci-fi based on comedy. The ""look"" of series 7 and 8 are far superior to the ""gray"" sets of series 1 and 2. I love this series! I love all the Red Dwarf series! Basically if you are casual fan I would give this a rating of 3 stars. Never seen it before I would give 3.5 stars.

The usual suspects - the laughter track, the lack of Rimmer, and the arrival of Christine Kochanski.I bought the DVD only to complete the set (with number eight to come). However, on second viewing the series has its funny moments and the storylines seem fresher than series six (though this isn't as funnier). Despite the flaws, series seven is still better than most TV comedy on offer (as another reviewer stated). Christine Kochanski, played by Chloe Annett, does bring new life and helps fill the vaccuum left by Chris Barrie.Red Dwarf's long run (eight series) is not only down to good comedy writing and performance, but also its adaptability to evolve - giving it a new lease of life now and again. I'm sure time will give a truer picture in how important this series is in relation to the others.Apparently, according to reviews, series eight is truly terrible, but I haven't seen it so I cannot pass comment on it.If you are a fan of Red Dwarf then you will probably be familiar with this series anyway.

Series 7 is very very different to the previous 6, in some ways it's good and in alot more ways it's very bad. For starters Chris Barrie decided to leave which left a major gap in the cast and co-writer Rob Grant also decided to part ways with Doug Naylor and co. The whole look and feel of the show changed big time which left us with a show that was more like a comedy drama than a situation comedy. Chris Barrie was replaced with the paifully unfunny Chloe Annett as Listers long time love interest Kochanski and there was no live audience. All in all series 7 seriously lacked the comedy punch of the previos 6 and the lack of Rimmer left Lister with no one to bounch off. Kryten suddenly turned gay and the Cat just became more and more irratating as the season progressed. It's not all bad however there were some really good episodes in this season such as the excelent 'Tikka To Ride' and 'Ouroboros' one of the few without Chris Barrie that actually worked and 'Stoke Me A clipper' is lots of fun 'Blue' is worth watching just for the munchkin song at the end.

950820,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BVM1TQ,Robert Moore,"[2, 5]","Some fans of RED DWARF were truly upset by the changes in Seasons Seven and Eight of the show.  In Season Seven Rimmer played a much smaller role while in Eight he was no longer a hologram.  Chlo Annett joined the show as Lister's former girlfriend Kristine Kochanski and while she did a nice job, she broke up the all boys club of the first six seasons.  In Season Seven the action was on the Space Bug while on Season Eight they finally get back to Red Dwarf, but one on which nanobots had restored all of the former crew members that had died in the show's first episode.  But while all of these represented major changes, the most important was the breakup of the Doug Naylor and Rob Grant writing team.  Grant did not continue with the show and whether because of that or whatever, the comic tone of the show changed dramatically.  As Craig Charles expressed it in an interview in the special features disc, the show ceased to be more of a sitcom and became more of a dramatic comedy.I can't count myself among the more fanatic RED DWARF fans.  I find it moderately entertaining and moderately funny in its best seasons, but perhaps because I was not among its biggest fans, the changes in the final two seasons bothered me a lot less than it seems to have done others.  There wasn't as much at stake for me as there was for others.  But I had no trouble finding large swathes of it to be quite humorous.  Interestingly, even though Chris Barrie (Rimmer) was not a fulltime cast member in Season Seven (or perhaps because he wasn't fulltime and they were determined to make his moments as funny as possible) the funniest moments in the season belonged to Rimmer.  The Season Seven second episode gave Rimmer a bit of a farewell by having Barrie play Ace Rimmer, and it was one of Chris Barrie's best episodes ever.  Then later in the season the Star Bug's crew undergoes ""The Rimmer Experience,"" which is nothing so much as a Rimmer musical puppet show.  For my moment, that is the single funniest moment in the history of the series.Season Seven was on Star Bug, but the bulk of Season Eight was on the newly reconstituted Red Dwarf.  I commend the producers for wanting to do something different, but frankly it just didn't feel like RED DWARF with a full crew.  Nor did it feel quite right with Rimmer being a human being rather than a hologram.  There were also fewer truly funny moments. Though both seasons suffered from having less brilliant dialogue than the first six seasons when Rob Grant and Doug Naylor were crafting the scripts.  The first six seasons were always more about talk and brilliant dialogue, while the next two seasons relied more on situational and visual humor as well as extended gags.All in all, I'm glad that Seasons Seven and Eight were made rather than not made.  They aren't quite as good as Seasons Three through Six (the first two, prior to Kryten's joining the show, simply weren't up to the level of what came after).  Still, there were many good moments.",3,"A very different show from earlier seasons, but still decent",1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,2998,"['fans', 'RED', 'DWARF', 'were', 'truly', 'upset', 'changes', 'Seasons', 'Seven', 'Eight', 'show', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Rimmer', 'played', 'much', 'smaller', 'role', 'Eight', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'hologram', 'Chlo', 'Annett', 'joined', 'show', 'Lister', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Kristine', 'Kochanski', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'broke', 'up', 'boys', 'club', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'Season', 'Seven', 'action', 'was', 'Space', 'Bug', 'Season', 'Eight', 'finally', 'get', 'back', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'one', 'nanobots', 'had', 'restored', 'former', 'crew', 'members', 'had', 'died', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'represented', 'major', 'changes', 'most', 'important', 'was', 'breakup', 'Doug', 'Naylor', 'Rob', 'Grant', 'writing', 'team', 'Grant', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'show', 'comic', 'tone', 'show', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'Craig', 'Charles', 'expressed', 'interview', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'show', 'ceased', 'be', 'more', 'sitcom', 'became', 'more', 'dramatic', 'comedy.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'more', 'fanatic', 'RED', 'DWARF', 'fans', 'find', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'moderately', 'funny', 'best', 'seasons', 'perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'biggest', 'fans', 'changes', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'bothered', 'lot', 'less', 'have', 'done', 'others', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'stake', 'was', 'others', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'large', 'swathes', 'be', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Interestingly', 'even', 'Chris', 'Barrie', 'Rimmer', 'was', 'not', 'fulltime', 'cast', 'member', 'Season', 'Seven', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'fulltime', 'were', 'determined', 'make', 'moments', 'as', 'funny', 'possible', 'funniest', 'moments', 'season', 'belonged', 'Rimmer', 'Season', 'Seven', 'second', 'episode', 'gave', 'Rimmer', 'bit', 'farewell', 'having', 'Barrie', 'play', 'Ace', 'Rimmer', 'was', 'one', 'Chris', 'Barrie', 'best', 'episodes', 'ever', 'Then', 'later', 'season', 'Star', 'Bug', 'crew', 'Rimmer', 'Experience', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'Rimmer', 'musical', 'puppet', 'show', 'moment', 'single', 'funniest', 'moment', 'history', 'series.Season', 'Seven', 'was', 'Star', 'Bug', 'bulk', 'Season', 'Eight', 'was', 'newly', 'reconstituted', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'commend', 'producers', 'wanting', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'RED', 'DWARF', 'full', 'crew', 'did', 'feel', 'quite', 'right', 'Rimmer', 'being', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'hologram', 'were', 'also', 'fewer', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'seasons', 'suffered', 'having', 'less', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'when', 'Rob', 'Grant', 'Doug', 'Naylor', 'were', 'crafting', 'scripts', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'were', 'always', 'more', 'talk', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'relied', 'more', 'situational', 'visual', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'gags.All', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Seasons', 'Seven', 'Eight', 'were', 'made', 'rather', 'not', 'made', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Seasons', 'Three', 'Six', 'first', 'two', 'prior', 'Kryten', 'joining', 'show', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'up', 'level', 'what', 'came', 'Still', 'were', 'many', 'good', 'moments']",N/A

""Jump The Shark"" is a phrase that describes the moment when a TV show loses its spark, when it becomes stale, unfunny or just plain boring. There are numerous well-known reasons for this happening (members of the cast leaving, new members being introduced in an attempt to bring new life to the show, writers leaving..) and amazingly, Red Dwarf managed all of these in the space between Season Six and Season Seven.We've all seen TV shows go down the pan, but I don't think I've ever seen a show take such a drastic, no-holds barred drop in quality as Red Dwarf did here (and continued to in Season Eight). Make no bones about it - Red Dwarf was a GREAT TV show. Endlessly quotable, it gave us superb characters like the anal, self-important Rimmer, the slobby yet humane Lister, they evolved the Cat from a one dimeonsional James Brown spoof into a real character (and even gave him one of the best running ""Dwayne Dibley"" character gags), and, of course, added Kryten in Series Three who became the heart of the entire show.And then, in the blink of an eye - Rimmer leaves, Kryten becomes whiney, irritating and almost the most loathsome character in the history of the show.Ah yes - I said almost. Enter Christine Kochanski, supposed to be Rimmer's replacement, but where Chris Barrie is funny, Chloe Annett just isn't. Quickly scrubbing out the entire show's history (where we saw a different Kochanski - Clare Grogan, as sweet, sexy and someone who you could imagine someone like Lister falling in love with), she became spoilt, irritable and downright unlikeable. Plus, for six whole seasons we were told Lister had only ever spoken to Kochanski a handful of times, always being too shy to actually ask her out. But no, come this series they HAD dated. So basically forget everything else that had happened before that, then. Just another reason to shake your head at the downward spiral of this series.The writing suffered too. Rob Grant left, leaving Doug Naylor and other hacks to ruin the fun. The live audience was binned too, giving us a hollow, totally obvious laughter track. And, believe it or not, it just got worse and worse.Like I've said in other reviews, sometimes this is just no fun. To witness a once brilliant program turn into this sub-standard garbage was painful. And yet I re-visited old demons to review it just for YOU.

950828,A1NDYL6D6QNVCI,B000BVM1TQ,"Valnastar ""Man With No Name""","[68, 70]","Red Dwarf Series VII is very different than any Red Dwarf to come before it. Rob Grant, half of the team that till then had created and written all Red Dwarf episodes, left the show and the strain on remaining writer Doug Naylor clearly shows. Some of the writing slack is taken up by others, including Robert Llewellyn (Kryten), who has written a few successful books on his own, but the feel of the show is never the same from here on out. The humor is now less dense and arguably less sharp at times, and the situations in which the characters find themselves often do not have the same comedic quality of the older shows. Additionally, Chloe Annett is introduced as Kochanski. While competent, she is far different than any of the actesses that originated the part like C.P. Grogan, and her addition to the cast takes time away from funnier established characters, like the Cat, who is brilliantly played by Danny John-Jules. To add to the list of unwanted changes, Chris Barrie was not fully available for this series and so is absent much of the time.That said, if you love Red Dwarf, you'll probably feel obligated to own these later shows anyway. There are still occasional brilliant moments, and the cast is still funny and committed to their roles, even if the writing is now very uneven. Series VII is better than Series VIII, which takes Red Dwarf even further away from it's original comedic fundamentals.As in Series VI, in Series VII the crew are still living aboard Starbug and still chasing the trail of their larger mother ship, the Red Dwarf. Episodes in Series VII are:1. Tikka To RideLister ignores Kryten's warnings about the hazards of time travel and takes the crew on a quest for more curry that will change history.2. Stoke Me A ClipperAce Rimmer returns to Red Dwarf to enlist the aid of Arnold Rimmer to continue his galactic fight for justice. Can Arnold actually be up to the challenge of becoming the greatest hero in the multi-verse?3. OuroborosLister discovers his true origins in a well-written episode full of paradox.4. Duct SoupLister tries to make Kochanski feel at home and Kryten becomes a wee bit jealous, with expected comedic results.5. BlueLister actually finds he misses Rimmer and Kryten invents a creative and hilarious solution to the problem.6. Beyond a JokeThe search for spare heads for Kryten leads the crew to a dangerous encounter with Simulants and GELFS.7. EpidemeA deadly and sentient virus infects Lister and drastic measures are needed to destroy it.8. NanarchyKryten's ""nanobots"" (microscopic robots) are found to be the culprits in the disappearance of their home ship, Red Dwarf, and may also provide a solution the disability with which Lister was left after the previous episode.In spite of all the changes to the show after Series VI, Red Dwarf Series VII is still better than most anything else on television. It's only when one compares it to earlier Red Dwarf that it seems disappointing. Previous Red Dwarf DVD releases have had excellent extra features, with hilarious outtakes (Smeg Ups), featurettes, hidden features, deleted scenes, and more and this set will be no exception. There's also a ""lost episode"" called Identity Within, performed by Chris Barrie and raw footage included in the extra features, so Red Dwarf fans will find plenty to love on this release.",4,"Not what it used to be, but still better than most other shows",1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,3337,"['Red', 'Dwarf', 'Series', 'VII', 'very', 'different', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'come', 'Rob', 'Grant', 'half', 'team', 'till', 'then', 'had', 'created', 'written', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'left', 'show', 'strain', 'remaining', 'writer', 'Doug', 'Naylor', 'clearly', 'writing', 'slack', 'taken', 'up', 'others', 'including', 'Robert', 'Llewellyn', 'Kryten', 'who', 'written', 'few', 'successful', 'books', 'own', 'feel', 'show', 'never', 'same', 'here', 'out', 'humor', 'now', 'less', 'dense', 'arguably', 'less', 'sharp', 'times', 'situations', 'characters', 'find', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'comedic', 'quality', 'older', 'shows', 'Additionally', 'Chloe', 'Annett', 'introduced', 'Kochanski', 'competent', 'far', 'different', 'actesses', 'originated', 'part', 'C.P', 'Grogan', 'addition', 'cast', 'time', 'away', 'funnier', 'established', 'characters', 'Cat', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Danny', 'John-Jules', 'add', 'list', 'unwanted', 'changes', 'Chris', 'Barrie', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'available', 'series', 'so', 'absent', 'much', 'time.That', 'said', 'love', 'Red', 'Dwarf', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'obligated', 'own', 'later', 'shows', 'anyway', 'are', 'still', 'occasional', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'cast', 'still', 'funny', 'committed', 'roles', 'even', 'writing', 'now', 'very', 'uneven', 'Series', 'VII', 'better', 'Series', 'VIII', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'even', 'further', 'away', 'original', 'comedic', 'fundamentals.As', 'Series', 'VI', 'Series', 'VII', 'crew', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'Starbug', 'still', 'chasing', 'trail', 'larger', 'mother', 'ship', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'Episodes', 'Series', 'VII', 'are:1', 'Tikka', 'RideLister', 'ignores', 'Kryten', 'warnings', 'hazards', 'time', 'travel', 'crew', 'quest', 'more', 'curry', 'will', 'change', 'history.2', 'Stoke', 'Me', 'A', 'ClipperAce', 'Rimmer', 'returns', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Arnold', 'Rimmer', 'continue', 'galactic', 'fight', 'justice', 'Can', 'Arnold', 'actually', 'be', 'challenge', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'hero', 'multi-verse', '3', 'OuroborosLister', 'true', 'origins', 'well-written', 'episode', 'full', 'paradox.4', 'Duct', 'SoupLister', 'make', 'Kochanski', 'feel', 'home', 'Kryten', 'wee', 'bit', 'jealous', 'expected', 'comedic', 'results.5', 'BlueLister', 'actually', 'Rimmer', 'Kryten', 'creative', 'hilarious', 'solution', 'problem.6', 'JokeThe', 'search', 'spare', 'heads', 'Kryten', 'crew', 'dangerous', 'encounter', 'Simulants', 'GELFS.7', 'EpidemeA', 'deadly', 'sentient', 'virus', 'infects', 'Lister', 'drastic', 'measures', 'are', 'needed', 'destroy', 'it.8', 'NanarchyKryten', 'nanobots', 'microscopic', 'robots', 'are', 'found', 'be', 'culprits', 'disappearance', 'home', 'ship', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'may', 'also', 'provide', 'solution', 'disability', 'Lister', 'was', 'left', 'previous', 'episode.In', 'spite', 'changes', 'show', 'Series', 'VI', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'Series', 'VII', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'television', 'only', 'when', 'one', 'earlier', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'disappointing', 'Previous', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'DVD', 'releases', 'have', 'had', 'excellent', 'extra', 'features', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'Smeg', 'Ups', 'hidden', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'exception', 'also', 'lost', 'episode', 'called', 'Identity', 'Within', 'performed', 'Chris', 'Barrie', 'raw', 'footage', 'included', 'extra', 'features', 'so', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'love', 'release']",N/A
