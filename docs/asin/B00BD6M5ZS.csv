The Scandinavians manage to portray women in a way that Americans haven't been able to: as smart, sexy, powerful, and flawed, but not psychotic or ditzy. I'd heard so many good things about this series before I started watching it that I was sure I would be disappointed, but to my surprise it was even better than I could have anticipated.

1625881,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00BD6M5ZS,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Season 1 of BORGEN was a revelation. Beautifully written, flawlessly acted, it cried out for more. How on earth could Season 2 be as good?By not tampering with the formula, for one thing. Season 2 plunges the viewer into Birgitte Nyborg&#8217;s term of office some time after Season 1 ended. Nothing else is altered. Crucially, the cast is the same. Complex relationships deepen, political intrigue heightens and through it all everything becomes even more interesting. The show is so beautifully plotted that even events such as negotiating peace within a warring African nation are entirely believable. And what&#8217;s more, the viewer is made to really care about how these events affect the characters.At the heart of it all, Sidse Babett Knudsen shines as Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg. She&#8217;s wonderful. But any show with a secret weapon like the one Ms Knudsen brings to the table can&#8217;t help but succeed, especially when it is used sparingly and tastefully and always for maximum impact&#8230;And what might that secret weapon be? Her smile.This is not just any smile, folks. Of course it helps that SBK is a beautiful woman (though not in a pin-up, look-at-me kind of way). There is a warmth, a glow to her smile that makes you want to smile back. With all the conflict and turmoil she faces in her professional and personal life, her smile has the effect of an oasis in a desert of challenges.To harp yet further on this not-to-be-underestimated attribute, SBK&#8217;s smile is made just one notch shy of nuclear-equivalent effulgence by one simple, little, totally natural quirk: The Crinkle.The way SBK&#8217;s nose crinkles up when she smiles is nothing short of mesmerizing. It is cute, tantalizing, sexy, vulnerable and fun all rolled into one. This exquisite physical characteristic is in the same league as Clint Eastwood&#8217;s squint, Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s pout, Burt Lancaster&#8217;s smile or any other big star&#8217;s magic &#8220;something&#8221; that captivates an audience. It&#8217;s SBK&#8217;s unique gift and it is no exaggeration to say that it is BORGEN&#8217;s secret weapon, for without a central protagonist who can stay accessible throughout the roller coaster ride that is the world of BORGEN, the show&#8217;s credibility would begin to crack as it looks towards its third and final season.Not so with &#8220;The Crinkle&#8221; unabashedly on display. It is as refreshing as a cold drink on a hot day. When Sidse crinkles, all is well. And as if to reinforce the effectiveness of this phenomenon, Season 2 ends with an extended, slow motion close-up of SBK smiling, in full crinkle mode. If that isn&#8217;t proof of the considered application of BORGEN&#8217;s secret weapon, I don&#8217;t know what is.If there is a criticism to be made about the series, it is the recurring use of the F word, which in a show of such intelligence is simply unnecessary, if not tiresome. This lapse in judgement aside, BORGEN is magnificent.Season 3, please. This show is as good as it gets.",5,More brilliance!,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3028,"['Season', '1', 'BORGEN', 'was', 'revelation', 'Beautifully', 'written', 'flawlessly', 'acted', 'cried', 'out', 'more', 'How', 'earth', 'could', 'Season', '2', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'tampering', 'formula', 'one', 'thing', 'Season', '2', 'viewer', 'Birgitte', 'Nyborg', '8217', 's', 'term', 'office', 'time', 'Season', '1', 'ended', 'Nothing', 'else', 'altered', 'Crucially', 'cast', 'same', 'Complex', 'relationships', 'deepen', 'political', 'intrigue', 'heightens', 'everything', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'show', 'so', 'beautifully', 'plotted', 'even', 'events', 'such', 'negotiating', 'peace', 'warring', 'African', 'nation', 'are', 'entirely', 'believable', 'what', '8217', 'more', 'viewer', 'made', 'really', 'care', 'how', 'events', 'affect', 'characters.At', 'heart', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'shines', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Birgitte', 'Nyborg', '8217', 'wonderful', 'show', 'secret', 'weapon', 'one', 'Ms', 'Knudsen', 'table', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'succeed', 'especially', 'when', 'used', 'sparingly', 'tastefully', 'always', 'maximum', 'impact', '8230', 'what', 'might', 'secret', 'weapon', 'be', 'smile.This', 'not', 'just', 'smile', 'folks', 'course', 'SBK', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'not', 'pin-up', 'look-at-me', 'kind', 'way', 'warmth', 'glow', 'smile', 'want', 'smile', 'back', 'conflict', 'turmoil', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'smile', 'effect', 'oasis', 'desert', 'challenges.To', 'harp', 'yet', 'further', 'not-to-be-underestimated', 'attribute', 'SBK', '8217', 'smile', 'made', 'just', 'one', 'notch', 'shy', 'nuclear-equivalent', 'effulgence', 'one', 'simple', 'little', 'totally', 'natural', 'quirk', 'Crinkle.The', 'way', 'SBK', '8217', 'nose', 'crinkles', 'up', 'when', 'nothing', 'short', 'mesmerizing', 'cute', 'tantalizing', 'sexy', 'vulnerable', 'fun', 'rolled', 'one', 'exquisite', 'physical', 'characteristic', 'same', 'league', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '8217', 'squint', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', '8217', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', '8217', 'smile', 'other', 'big', 'star', '8217', 'magic', '8220', 'something', '8221', 'audience', '8217', 'SBK', '8217', 'unique', 'gift', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'BORGEN', '8217', 'secret', 'weapon', 'central', 'protagonist', 'who', 'can', 'stay', 'accessible', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'world', 'BORGEN', 'show', '8217', 's', 'credibility', 'would', 'begin', 'crack', 'third', 'final', 'season.Not', '8220', 'Crinkle', '8221', 'unabashedly', 'display', 'as', 'refreshing', 'cold', 'drink', 'hot', 'day', 'When', 'Sidse', 'crinkles', 'well', 'reinforce', 'effectiveness', 'phenomenon', 'Season', '2', 'ends', 'extended', 'slow', 'motion', 'close-up', 'SBK', 'smiling', 'full', 'crinkle', 'mode', 'isn', '8217', 'proof', 'considered', 'application', 'BORGEN', '8217', 'secret', 'weapon', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'is.If', 'criticism', 'be', 'made', 'series', 'recurring', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'show', 'such', 'intelligence', 'simply', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'tiresome', 'lapse', 'judgement', 'aside', 'BORGEN', 'magnificent.Season', '3', 'please', 'show', 'as', 'good']",Borgen - Complete Series 2 [NON-U.S.A.

1625882,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B00BD6M5ZS,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister &#8211; after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",4,"I liked Borgen, but didn't quite love it.

Sidse Babett Knudsen as the Prime Minister of Denmark has learned the tough lessons for a first term, now,she is tougher, better prepared and an about to be divorced woman. This second term is a tough year.Nyborg has learned how to take power from a bunch of male politicians who refer to her as ""Mommy"" whenever she leaves the room. Nyborg, does a lot of brilliant things, and it seems she is at the top of her game. Nyborg and her husband have separated, her children feel alone, her daughter develops an anxiety that is difficult to control, and Nyborg has no one to talk to. Her close mentor had a stroke and she had to fire him. Her spin doctor, Kasper, played by Pilou Asbaek is meeting his devilish childhood head on, his off and on girlfriend, Katrine Fosmark, played by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, moves from one job to another to find her ethical boundaries. Everyone seems to be in flux, everyone has an edge, everyone is trying to find themselves.However, each episode finds that Nyborg is becoming stronger, more able to meet her detractors head on. She is still alone, her daughter in trouble, but things are about to come to a head. What we learn is that life is about compromise, political, personal, public and private. Nyborg blames herself for her daughter's problems, the marriage issues, and is now trying to look to the future to see what lays ahead. She has proved her mettle, and shown her colleagues that she is a true Prime Minister, in word and deed.This is one of the best political series on either side of the big pond.

1625887,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B00BD6M5ZS,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[4, 4]","Note: This review contains spoilers.  I'm halfway through Season 2, watching on PBS, and I'm hooked. I find BORGEN the perfect balance of the interpersonal and the political, public and private.  I can't think of another show that more deftly illustrates the impact of political discourse on people's lives, and vice-versa, and it does so every week in a way that consistently delivers a POWERFUL punch both intellectually and emotionally.  The camerawork is phenomenal, so intimate, pulls you right in.  [UPDATE- the season got better and better, culminating with cliffhangers both personal and political, OUTSTANDING.]I love the subtitles, obviously done by non-Native English speakers, e.g., ""Hey- those are just the perps that come with the job..."" [percs], ""you need the pressure of the right people"" [support], ""so"" substituted for ""but"", compassionate for sympathetic, etc., just slightly off, charming.  As with British shows (such as the Irish crime-drama SINGLE-HANDED, another new favorite, link below, available with Prime), Danish TV doesn't censor obscenities, interesting to hear four letter expletives in Danish.  It's often obvious what's being said from the inflection, even through they're blanked out in the subtitles for American TV.Single-Handed- Season 1Natural JusticeAnother aspect I find intriguing is the depiction of government on a much smaller scale.  One soldier killed in Afghanistan produces a national outcry.  In one episode the prime minister's kids were upset with her for not cooking dinner.  Birgitte washes her own dishes, tries to unstop the kitchen sink, and cleans the house, but also flies to Africa to broker peace talks.I have family in England, and BORGEN well illustrates the close ties and interdependency of EU nations and people, quite foreign (literally) to our insular way of thinking.  Similarly, American politics and the media are so polarized, polarizing, it's refreshing in the extreme to see a story that shows conflicting, and yet well-fleshed out, comprehensible points of view.  Everyone's human, fallible, sure, but it's not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys.  Not to go off on a tangent, but for example, animal-lovers in America often villainize hunters- yet I've read that hunters have done more to safeguard animal habitats and preserve more species than any other group in America (starting with Charles Audubon, an avid hunter).  BORGEN takes the time to paint people and issues in relatively fine brushstrokes.  I'm SO impressed, for example, with the thoughtful, sophisticated handling of mental illness, its very personal impact but also attendant issues, such as stressors, individualized treatment, the appropriateness of medication, etc.  Bringing Kasper's perspective in on it was a stroke of genius.I find BORGEN captivating, fascinating on many levels.  I especially love the stories of the characters' personal lives- handled with such subtlety (as compared to The West Wing, for example, which I often found obvious and over-wrought).  I was quite overcome by the episode about childhood, barely saw it coming.  Director Sidney Lumet once said ""In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.""  I puzzle over what that means, exactly, but by that definition I'd say BORGEN is both superb drama and superb melodrama, as the characters and the story so inform, so enrich each other, and seamlessly so.  The writing, the acting, the direction is as good as it gets, for me, just wonderful.
